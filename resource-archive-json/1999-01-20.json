-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> Sir, Malaysia has to date not submitted\r\n\r\nits written legal arguments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that Singapore rejected Malaysia's\r\n\r\nclaim  that  they  had a legal right to operate  their  Customs,\r\n\r\nImmigration and Quarantine (CIQ) at Tanjong Pagar.  However,  we\r\n\r\nallowed them three months, until 31st October 1998, to submit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwritten legal arguments to substantiate their claim.   Five days\r\n\r\nbefore the 31st October deadline expired, Malaysia requested  an\r\n\r\nextension  of  the  deadline by 1 1/2  months.   We  agreed  and\r\n\r\naccordingly  extended  the  deadline  to  15th  December   1998.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Malaysia did not submit their arguments  by  the  15th\r\n\r\nDecember  deadline  nor did they give us any  explanation,  even\r\n\r\nthough  our High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur reminded  them  on\r\n\r\n11th  December 1998.  On 16th December 1998, after the  deadline\r\n\r\nhad  expired,  Singapore sent a Third Person  Note  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Government for an explanation and to ask when  it  was\r\n\r\nsubmitting its legal arguments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, my Permanent Secretary spoke to his\r\n\r\ncounterpart  in the Malaysian Foreign Ministry and informed  him\r\n\r\nthat  we were awaiting a reply to our Third Person Note of  16th\r\n\r\nDecember  1998  and  for their explanation why  they  failed  to\r\n\r\nsubmit their arguments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, the then Foreign Minister Dato' Seri Abdullah\r\n\r\nBadawi  replied on 26th December 1998, referring to the  meeting\r\n\r\nbetween the two Prime Ministers in Hanoi on 17th December  1998,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  two  Prime  Ministers agreed  to  discuss  and  seek\r\n\r\nsolutions  to  all outstanding bilateral issues  as  a  package,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  location of the CIQ.   His main point  was  that\r\n\r\nthis latest agreement between the two Prime Ministers superseded\r\n\r\nany  previous  undertaking  or understanding  at  the  officials\r\n\r\nlevel.     Malaysia's  understanding  was  therefore  that   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  a  deadline  should no  longer  arise.    He  also\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  Malaysian officials would  be  ready  to  begin\r\n\r\nnegotiations sometime after Hari Raya Aidilfitri.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I replied on 30th December 1998 to point out that when the\r\n\r\ntwo  Prime  Ministers met in Hanoi on 17th December 1998,  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh had told Prime Minister Mahathir that  Singapore's\r\n\r\nposition  on the CIQ issue was straightforward, namely, Malaysia\r\n\r\nwould  have to recognise Singapore's sovereignty and  not  claim\r\n\r\nthat it had a legal right to operate its CIQ in Singapore.    If\r\n\r\nso,  he  was prepared to discuss the next step.  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nGoh added that although there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwas no legislation allowing Malaysian Immigration to operate  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  he was prepared to discuss the possible location  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  CIQ facilities in Singapore as part of a package  of\r\n\r\nbilateral issues to be resolved.  But first of all, the question\r\n\r\nwhether  Malaysia still claims to have a legal right  to  be  at\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar had to be resolved.   Indeed, when Prime Minister\r\n\r\nGoh  met  the press immediately after the meeting, he  told  the\r\n\r\nmedia  that  Malaysia  should still give Singapore  their  legal\r\n\r\narguments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my reply to then Foreign Minister Badawi, we have\r\n\r\nstressed that any negotiations on the location of the CIQ  could\r\n\r\nproceed  only  after Singapore's sovereignty over Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nand Woodlands has been acknowledged and not disputed.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  Malaysia has claimed a legal right for its Customs  and\r\n\r\nImmigration   to   operate  in  Singapore  at   Tanjong   Pagar.\r\n\r\nSingapore  rejects  this.    This is a question  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsovereignty,  just  as  Malaysian  airspace  is  a  question  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  sovereignty.   When Malaysia refused RSAF permission\r\n\r\nto  fly  over Malaysia, Singapore acknowledged this sovereignty.\r\n\r\nWe expect them to acknowledge our sovereignty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have informed Malaysia that if they do not produce their\r\n\r\nlegal arguments in one month's time, we will assume that they no\r\n\r\nlonger wish to pursue their legal claim to be at Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether it is important to highlight the legal  points\r\n\r\nin  this  case  or should it not be subsumed under some  overall\r\n\r\nnegotiating position because some members of the public do raise\r\n\r\nthis point?  Also, may I ask whether the appointment of the  new\r\n\r\nForeign Minister, Datuk Syed Hamid Albar would have some  impact\r\n\r\non the resolution of the CIQ and other bilateral issues?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me take the first\r\n\r\npart  of  Dr  Ong  Chit Chung's question, ie,  why  we  need  to\r\n\r\nhighlight  the  legal aspect.  It is not so much  \"highlighting\"\r\n\r\nthe  legal  aspect  because Members  will  recall  that  it  was\r\n\r\nMalaysia which wanted the CIQ issue to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  included in the package of bilateral issues to be  resolved,\r\n\r\naccording  to the two Prime Ministers' agreement.  We agreed  to\r\n\r\nthis.   But, because Malaysia insisted that it had a legal right\r\n\r\nfor its CIQ to operate in Singapore - as Members will recall the\r\n\r\ndebate  we  had on 31st July last year - Malaysia has  therefore\r\n\r\nraised a fundamental question of sovereignty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There really can be no two ways about it. Either\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  CIQ in Singapore are there as a matter of  right  or\r\n\r\nthey  are there because of our leave and consent.  If Malaysia's\r\n\r\nCIQ are in Singapore because of an inherent legal right, then of\r\n\r\ncourse  it  follows  that there is no need  for  any  negotiated\r\n\r\npolitical  settlement because they are there as of legal  right.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is important, from Singapore's point of view, that\r\n\r\nthe  question of Singapore's sovereignty has to be acknowledged.\r\n\r\nWe  have  told  the Malaysians that if they do not submit  their\r\n\r\nlegal arguments within a month then we will assume that they  no\r\n\r\nlonger  maintain that they have a legal right to  operate  their\r\n\r\nCIQ in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's second question about the new Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister,  let me say that I have previously worked  with  Datuk\r\n\r\nSeri Syed Hamid when he was Minister of Justice in Malaysia.   I\r\n\r\nin  fact  had a very good working relationship with him in  that\r\n\r\ncapacity  and  I  look forward to working closely  with  him  to\r\n\r\nresolve outstanding bilateral issues and to strengthen bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations.   Members might have read in the media that  the  new\r\n\r\nForeign  Minister  has  in  fact  spoken  quite  positively   on\r\n\r\nbilateral  relations and has indicated a desire to work  towards\r\n\r\nimproving  ties.  According to media reports, he  has  said  his\r\n\r\npriority would be Singapore-Malaysia ties.  He said that he  was\r\n\r\noptimistic and that it should not be difficult to resolve issues\r\n\r\namicably. I welcome his remarks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister what the Government would do if Malaysia continues  not\r\n\r\nto  acknowledge the sovereign rights of Singapore over  the  CIQ\r\n\r\nissue and at the same time they also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfail  to  submit  the legal arguments but want  to  continue  to\r\n\r\noperate their CIQ here.  What would the Government do?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> I have always taken the position in this\r\n\r\nHouse that we should take things one step at a time.  It is  not\r\n\r\nthat  Foreign  Ministries  and Foreign Ministers  never  inquire\r\n\r\ninternally  on  what to do if certain questions  such  as  those\r\n\r\nposed by the Member arise.  We always have to address \"what  if\"\r\n\r\nquestions.   But in bilateral relations, we have to assume  that\r\n\r\nthings  will  develop one step at a time.  I would not  like  to\r\n\r\nprejudge  this issue.  I would like to give the Malaysians  time\r\n\r\nto respond to the position I have outlined.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister whether it is the stand of the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nthat, prior to the moving of the CIQ to Woodlands, Malaysia  was\r\n\r\noperating  its CIQ at Tanjong Pagar simply at the  will  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government, just a bare licence, or whether there  was\r\n\r\na legal right for them to operate the CIQ at Tanjong Pagar?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> That is precisely the issue. Singapore's\r\n\r\nposition is that Malaysia's operation of CIQ facilities here  is\r\n\r\nnot  on  the  basis  of  a  legal  right  or  on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\nextraterritorial rights.  They are here on the  basis  of  leave\r\n\r\nand consent of the Singapore Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> The Minister\r\n\r\nmentioned a one-month further deadline, after which he  presumes\r\n\r\nMalaysia  would  not raise the claim again.  What  is  there  to\r\n\r\nprevent Malaysia from raising the claim after this deadline?  In\r\n\r\nthe  same  connection, what is the reassurance that in packaging\r\n\r\nvarious  issues  together, Malaysia would move  to  the  slowest\r\n\r\ncommon denominator?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> On the second part of the question, if\r\n\r\nthey move to the slowest common denominator, then conclusion  of\r\n\r\nthe framework of wider cooperation, which the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\ntalked  about several times in this House and to which  we  have\r\n\r\ncommitted, will be that much more time-consuming.  But  again  I\r\n\r\nwould\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  like to assume that it will proceed on the \"slowest  common\r\n\r\ndenominator\".  We have to take the position, as both  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinisters  explained to the press, that both want to  solve  the\r\n\r\npackage  as  early as possible.  They have said  that  they  are\r\n\r\nprepared to start the discussion on the package at the officials\r\n\r\nlevel  soon  after Hari Raya Aidilfitri.  We have said  that  we\r\n\r\nwelcome  that.  But, first, the question of the legal issue  and\r\n\r\nthe  question of sovereignty have to be resolved and put  behind\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the first part of the Member's question, if\r\n\r\nthat  issue is not resolved, obviously we cannot proceed to  the\r\n\r\npackage   of  issues  negotiations  because  it  will   not   be\r\n\r\nproductive.  There will always be a question mark over  the  CIQ\r\n\r\nissue.   Are we negotiating the CIQ issue on the basis of  their\r\n\r\ninherent  legal right?  Will they claim it in future?   If  they\r\n\r\nclaim  it in future, it will mean that we have not resolved  it.\r\n\r\nSo  it has to be resolved.  It has to be put behind us.  That is\r\n\r\nwhy this basic legal issue has to be resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> This being a\r\n\r\nsovereign issue, which I think is not up for negotiation,  would\r\n\r\nthe Minister consider referring this matter to the International\r\n\r\nCourt of Justice?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, on a technical\r\n\r\nmatter  of  referring the matter to the International  Court  of\r\n\r\nJustice, on this procedural point, it requires two countries  to\r\n\r\nagree  to  refer a matter to the International Court of Justice.\r\n\r\nBut  we  have not reached that stage.  We will reach that  stage\r\n\r\nonly when we see their position.  If they insist that they still\r\n\r\nhave  a legal right, then, as I mentioned in Parliament on  31st\r\n\r\nJuly last year, if they send their legal arguments, we have said\r\n\r\nthat the two Attorneys-General and officials, the legal experts,\r\n\r\nwill  sit down and meet first and see whether it can be hammered\r\n\r\nout  and  resolved by a meeting of the legal experts.

This is because, as I informed Parliament  on\r\n\r\n29th  June 1998, officials from Singapore and Malaysia  on  14th\r\n\r\nApril  1998 had already reached the agreement on the text  of  a\r\n\r\nSpecial  Agreement to refer Malaysia's claim to Pedra Branca  to\r\n\r\nthe International Court of Justice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Can I ask the Minister what is\r\n\r\nthe  status of the matter now being handled by the International\r\n\r\nCourt of Justice?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> As I said, the text of the Special\r\n\r\nAgreement has been agreed upon.

The\r\n\r\nproposal  to replace the Causeway with a bridge is actually  not\r\n\r\npart  of  the  package of bilateral issues  that  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysian  officials have discussed.  In fact, this proposal  is\r\n\r\nnot  new,  nor has it been raised officially.  There were  press\r\n\r\nreports, I believe, in 1996 to which Prime Minister Goh as  well\r\n\r\nas my Ministry responded.  But these reports resurfaced recently\r\n\r\nin  a number of Malaysian press reports that a consortium called\r\n\r\nGerbang Perdana had secured in-principle approval to construct a\r\n\r\nbridge  to  replace  the  Causeway.  The  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  issued  a press statement on  18th  December  which\r\n\r\nreiterated  that the Singapore Government had not  received  any\r\n\r\nofficial   proposal  from  the  Malaysian  Government   on   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of a new bridge to replace the Causeway.  Only  when\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government has received such a proposal  and  is\r\n\r\nable to evaluate it, would we be able to comment on it further?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me say again that any proposal to build a bridge\r\n\r\nmust  be  agreed to by the two governments.

Today,  we\r\n\r\nhave  more  than 6,000 units which have been launched but  still\r\n\r\nunsold.   There are another 10,000 units not launched  but  with\r\n\r\nall  the  prerequisites for sale.

All in all, we have about 26,000 to 27,000 units  in\r\n\r\nthe  pipeline.  So there is no sense of urgency to release  land\r\n\r\nfor  this year.

So  far,  how many and which hotels  have  been  given\r\n\r\nfunds?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The hotels interested in refurbishing\r\n\r\ntheir premises should apply to the Singapore Tourism Board which\r\n\r\nwill  evaluate their proposals.  The allowance of up to 150%  is\r\n\r\navailable  to  hotels  which are within  the  safeguarded  area.\r\n\r\nThere  are certain areas within the Orchard Road corridor  which\r\n\r\nwe have safeguarded for hotels.  They are not allowed to convert\r\n\r\nto  other uses.  So these hotels are allowed to apply up to 150%\r\n\r\nof  the  Special  Allowance.   For  other  hotels,  the  Special\r\n\r\nAllowance  could go up to 130%.  They have to apply  within  the\r\n\r\nperiod.   The  refurbishment project must commence  not  earlier\r\n\r\nthan  1st  July last year, which was the starting date  for  the\r\n\r\nscheme, and finish not later than 30th June 2003.

I  think some of the premises may  be  lacking,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  IT  facilities, or maybe they are a bit old.   So  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  idea  is  to be generous so long as they  meet  certain\r\n\r\nminimum criteria.  The intention is to support them.  So what  I\r\n\r\nhave   mentioned  just  now  is  to  distinguish   between   the\r\n\r\nsafeguarded  area  and the areas outside.  The  reason  is  that\r\n\r\nwithin the safeguarded area, which is the main tourism belt,  we\r\n\r\nare  limiting  their  use of the land.  In the  past,  when  the\r\n\r\nproperty market was hot, they wanted to convert to condominiums.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  said  no.  So for that  reason,  I  think  they\r\n\r\ndeserve somewhat more favourable treatment.

But when they\r\n\r\nget  approval,  then  the amount that  is  approved  up  to  the\r\n\r\napproved  percentage  could  be  offset  against  their  taxable\r\n\r\nincome.   This  is  like  giving pioneer status  and  investment\r\n\r\nallowance  to  manufacturing projects.

Other  full-time postgraduate students not on the research scholarships  and\r\n\r\nstudentships  are eligible to borrow up to 80% of their  tuition\r\n\r\nfees  through  the Tuition Fee Loan scheme.  These schemes  will\r\n\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Government-funded scholarships,\r\n\r\nbursaries  and loan schemes administered by the institutions  of\r\n\r\nhigher\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlearning,  other forms of financial assistance are also  offered\r\n\r\nby  foundations, community groups, self-help groups, and private\r\n\r\nand professional organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to note that the student unions in the\r\n\r\nuniversities  have  sustained their  self-help  initiatives  for\r\n\r\nneedy  students  through the Students'  Funds.   The  Government\r\n\r\nmatches  dollar for dollar the student unions' efforts to  raise\r\n\r\nfunds for these students. In April 1998, the Government matching\r\n\r\ngrant limit for the NTU Students' Union Fund was raised to $0.75\r\n\r\nmillion.   Government  will be prepared to  consider  increasing\r\n\r\nthis grant limit should there be a need to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GOVERNMENT'S POLICY ON HEDGE FUNDS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Shriniwas\r\n\r\nRai -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.

There are many types of hedge funds.  Some\r\n\r\ntake  large and unhedged market positions, betting on  movements\r\n\r\nof exchange rates, interest rates, and market trends. Others use\r\n\r\ndefensive  and  hedged strategies to protect themselves  against\r\n\r\nadverse  market movements.  Some borrow heavily from  banks,  to\r\n\r\nbecome  highly leveraged funds. However, the majority  of  hedge\r\n\r\nfunds are only lightly geared, and trade mainly using their  own\r\n\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risks which highly leveraged hedge funds can pose to\r\n\r\nfinancial  systems are well-publicised.  Such  hedge  funds  can\r\n\r\nrapidly  build  up large market positions, using money  borrowed\r\n\r\nfrom other institutions.  When their aggressive one-way bets\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo  wrong,  the  unwinding  of these accumulated  positions  can\r\n\r\nthreaten to destabilise the whole financial system.  The  recent\r\n\r\ndebacle of Long Term Capital Management was a vivid example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these risks are not specific to hedge funds.\r\n\r\nBanks   and   other  financial  institutions,   and   especially\r\n\r\nproprietary  trading  desks of banks, often  engage  in  similar\r\n\r\nleveraged strategies as hedge funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some risk that speculation by hedge funds can\r\n\r\nimpair  the ability of governments to manage exchange rates  and\r\n\r\nconduct monetary policies.  However, this risk exists regardless\r\n\r\nof  whether  hedge funds base their fund managers in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nHong  Kong or anywhere else.  Decisions to take large aggressive\r\n\r\nbets  are made by their head offices, and do not depend on where\r\n\r\nthe hedge fund managers are located.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While hedge funds have been blamed for causing the Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis, an IMF study in December 1997 found that their\r\n\r\nrole in the Asian financial crisis had been greatly exaggerated,\r\n\r\nand  that  the  underlying causes were basic weaknesses  in  the\r\n\r\nbanking and corporate sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A world class financial centre is characterised by a wide\r\n\r\nrange  of  investors, intermediaries and financial  instruments.\r\n\r\nIt  has active markets and efficient exchanges. The presence  of\r\n\r\ndiverse investors stimulates the development of a broad range of\r\n\r\nfinancial instruments.  Established financial centres  like  New\r\n\r\nYork,  London  and Hong Kong are already hosts to  such  a  wide\r\n\r\nspectrum of investors, including hedge funds.  This has fostered\r\n\r\nthe use of innovative investment techniques in these centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS therefore has no blanket policy either to ban or to\r\n\r\nattract hedge funds. Hedge funds wishing to operate in Singapore\r\n\r\nare  subject  to the same regulations and licensing criteria  as\r\n\r\nany other funds and fund management companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS' supervisory approach is to ensure that financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  are  not over-exposed to any  particular  counter-party or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntype  of  asset.   MAS  will  continue  to  emphasise  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions' reporting of large trades and positions as well as\r\n\r\ncompliance  with  prudential exposure limits.   MAS  uses  these\r\n\r\nsupervisory  tools to monitor and manage systemic  risk  in  our\r\n\r\nmarkets  and  exchanges, and to restrain financial  institutions\r\n\r\nfrom  becoming  excessively exposed to any  particular  counter-party, including hedge funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulators in developed countries are actively studying the\r\n\r\nissue  of  how  to improve disclosure and reporting requirements\r\n\r\nfor   hedge   funds   and  other  market  participants.    Given\r\n\r\nSingapore's  position as a major financial centre,  MAS  has  an\r\n\r\ninterest in higher disclosure standards and is participating  in\r\n\r\nsuch  studies.  MAS  will  ensure that our  own  disclosure  and\r\n\r\nreporting requirements meet international best practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister whether our financial institutions and financial\r\n\r\nregulatory  system in Singapore are strong enough to manage  the\r\n\r\nhedge  funds,  especially now that we welcome  the  presence  of\r\n\r\nhedge funds in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are always\r\n\r\nwatching carefully developments and tracking whether we need  to\r\n\r\nmake adjustments to our supervision and regulation policies.

My  Ministry will conduct a survey  to  gauge  the\r\n\r\nemployers' response to the revised NWC guidelines.  The findings\r\n\r\nare  expected  to be available by April 1999.  In the  meantime,\r\n\r\nfeedback from employers and settlements of cases referred to  my\r\n\r\nMinistry for conciliation indicates that most employers in  both\r\n\r\nthe  unionised  and non-unionised sectors have  implemented  the\r\n\r\nwage reduction guidelines issued by the NWC.  The extent of wage\r\n\r\ncut   varies  from  company  to  company  depending   on   their\r\n\r\nperformance.  If this trend continues, the companies  should  be\r\n\r\nable  to  reduce their wage cost by 5-8% as recommended  by  the\r\n\r\nNWC.   Together  with  the  10  percentage  point  cut  in   the\r\n\r\nemployers' CPF contribution implemented in January this year, we\r\n\r\nshould be able to achieve the target of 15% reduction in overall\r\n\r\nwage cost to regain business competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM's survey will also determine whether senior management\r\n\r\npersonnel had taken a bigger cut in their salary as compared  to\r\n\r\ntheir  junior  counterparts.  While the detailed  findings  will\r\n\r\nonly  be  available  in  April,  information  available  so  far\r\n\r\nindicates that many companies have implemented a bigger  cut  in\r\n\r\nthe  salary of their executives and senior management personnel.\r\n\r\nIn  the  case  of the civil service, senior civil  servants  are\r\n\r\nsubjected  to higher cuts in their salaries compared  to  junior\r\n\r\nofficers as announced by DPM Lee in November last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Ong's question on the impact of cost\r\n\r\nreduction  resulting from some companies wanting to  return  the\r\n\r\nCPF  savings to their employees, I would like to point out  that\r\n\r\nonly  companies which continue to perform very well would be  in\r\n\r\nthe  position  to do so.  The CPF Board has so far  received  49\r\n\r\nenquiries  by  companies on the possibility of continuing  their\r\n\r\ncontribution  at  20%.  Another seven companies  have  indicated\r\n\r\nthat they were considering passing the savings from the CPF  cut\r\n\r\nto  their  employees in the form of additional bonuses or  other\r\n\r\nbenefits.

Better qualified  foreigners  are\r\n\r\nissued  with  \"P\" or \"Q\" work passes.  In assessing the type  of\r\n\r\nwork  pass to be issued, my Ministry takes into consideration  a\r\n\r\nnumber   of   factors  including  the  foreigner's   educational\r\n\r\nqualification, job experience and income as well as  the  nature\r\n\r\nof the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress that although the income criterion\r\n\r\nis  used  as  a  proxy  to  the  economic  contribution  of  the\r\n\r\nforeigner,  it  is, however, not the sole criterion.   The  work\r\n\r\npass  system  is designed to provide flexibility in  considering\r\n\r\nall  deserving  applications for work passes.

It is important to keep in view  the  object  of\r\n\r\nthe  exercise, ie, to clean up illegal parking.  This is because\r\n\r\nthey  can  be  a  danger  to other road  users  as  well  as  an\r\n\r\nobstruction to other road users.  In any case, while people  who\r\n\r\nhave  been affected must make the necessary adjustments, on  our\r\n\r\npart we have looked at whether or not more parking spaces can be\r\n\r\ncreated.  Wherever possible, URA working with Traffic Police and\r\n\r\nLTA,  will create more parking spaces.

It could be five minutes, 10 minutes, 15  minutes\r\n\r\nor  20 minutes.

The Traffic Police has studied and assessed the situation.\r\n\r\nI  think the House will agree that the problem has been  a  long\r\n\r\nstanding one which must be resolved.  If it is a single  zig-zag\r\n\r\nline, the law says you can stop just to alight or to pick  up  a\r\n\r\nperson and then you have to go.  If it is a double zig-zag line,\r\n\r\nyou  cannot  even  stop.  So whether it is for one  minute,  two\r\n\r\nminutes or three minutes, the law would have been flouted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INSTALLATION OF BARRIERS BETWEEN BUS STOPS AND ROADS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications  if  the  Land  Transport  Authority   or   other\r\n\r\nappropriate  authorities will consider  putting  up  full-height\r\n\r\nsteel  and  plastic barriers between bus stops  and  the  roads,\r\n\r\nwhich  have been installed in some European countries, in  order\r\n\r\nto  protect  passengers from rain and car splashes, as  well  as\r\n\r\npossible  tragedies when incoming buses lose control  and  crash\r\n\r\ninto waiting passengers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Phun) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbarriers  had previously been tried out at some bus  stops.

He highlighted two issues:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, reproducing a core group of Singaporeans who are\r\n\r\nsteeped  in  the Chinese cultural heritage, history,  literature\r\n\r\nand  the  arts.   We need them to be Chinese language  teachers,\r\n\r\nwriters, journalists, community leaders, MPs and Ministers; and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, setting realistic standards for Chinese Language in\r\n\r\nschools, standards that students of average ability can  achieve\r\n\r\nwith  a  reasonable  effort, especially students  from  English-speaking home backgrounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Challenge: Achieving two objectives in parallel</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this, the Ministry of Education has done a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive review of the teaching of Chinese language in  our\r\n\r\nschools.   The  study involved school principals from  both  SAP\r\n\r\nschools   and   English-language   schools,   MOE's   curriculum\r\n\r\ndevelopment  staff,  its policy officers, MOE's  ministers,  and\r\n\r\nmyself.  The study covered the following issues:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Encouraging more students to study Higher Chinese (HCL) in\r\n\r\nschools, and achieve a deeper understanding of Chinese culture;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Developing a few more schools with a stronger Chinese\r\n\r\nenvironment;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Reviewing the cultural content of the Chinese language\r\n\r\nsyllabus;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Setting the appropriate standards of Chinese Language (CL)\r\n\r\nto be expected of the majority of students; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Addressing the problems of pupils who have difficulty\r\n\r\nlearning Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted the study's recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe  policies  on teaching and learning Chinese have  long  term\r\n\r\nimplications  and  affect many teachers,  pupils,  and  parents.\r\n\r\nBefore  I  present the main changes, let me explain our  overall\r\n\r\napproach to the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Constant philosophy; adapting implementation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's long-standing policy on bilingualism and\r\n\r\nlearning   of  mother  tongues  in  schools  remains  unchanged.\r\n\r\nEnglish is and will remain our common working language.   It  is\r\n\r\nthe  language of global business, commerce and technology.   But\r\n\r\nthe  mother tongue gives us a crucial part of our values,  roots\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nidentity.   It gives us direct access to our cultural  heritage,\r\n\r\nand a world-view that complements the perspective of the English-speaking  world.  It provides us the ballast to  face  adversity\r\n\r\nand  challenges with fortitude, and a sense of quiet  confidence\r\n\r\nabout  our  place in the world.  Maintaining our distinctiveness\r\n\r\nand  identity as an Asian society will help us to  endure  as  a\r\n\r\nnation.  This applies to all ethnic groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In teaching the Chinese language, we have two objectives:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To develop the pupil's linguistic skills, in terms of\r\n\r\nlistening, speaking, reading and writing; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To transmit Chinese culture and traditional values through\r\n\r\nthe study of CL.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These twin objectives recognise the importance of CL as a\r\n\r\nmeans of transmitting culture and values.  The level of language\r\n\r\nskills  we can aim for will vary for different groups of pupils,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  their aptitudes and abilities.  But  we  want  to\r\n\r\ninculcate  these  cultural  values  even  in  pupils  who   have\r\n\r\ndifficulty learning CL, if necessary, partly by using English.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the strategic goals have remained constant, their\r\n\r\nimplementation  has  changed over time,  to  adapt  to  changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   Most recently, in 1991 a committee  chaired  by\r\n\r\nthen  Deputy  Prime  Minister Mr Ong Teng  Cheong  reviewed  the\r\n\r\nChinese   language   syllabus.    It   recommended   significant\r\n\r\nimprovements to the teaching and learning of Chinese language in\r\n\r\nschools.   These  have  since  been  implemented,  including   a\r\n\r\ncompletely  new  set  of  textbooks for all  levels,  with  much\r\n\r\nimproved cultural content.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Emerging trends</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation continues to develop. Several trends\r\n\r\naffect the learning and teaching of CL in Singapore:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the language profile of Singaporean families is\r\n\r\nchanging  rapidly.   More  Singaporean homes  are  now  English-speaking.  Younger families are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmuch  more  likely to be English-speaking than older  ones.   In\r\n\r\n1988,  only  20%  of  the Primary 1 cohort  came  from  English-speaking homes.  By 1998, the figure was 40%.  In 10 years,  the\r\n\r\nproportion  has  doubled.  In other words, if you  look  at  the\r\n\r\nchildren  in  school today, the `O' level group, only  20%  come\r\n\r\nfrom English-speaking homes, but the Primary 1 group, which  has\r\n\r\njust  started school, 40% come from English-speaking homes.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  that  was last year's figures.  This year, Primary  1  is\r\n\r\n43%.   The figure will continue to rise.  This will have a major\r\n\r\nimpact  on the learning and teaching of Chinese language in  our\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, globalisation and the knowledge economy are\r\n\r\nputting  a premium on internationally mobile talent.  Successful\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have many opportunities to live and work  overseas.\r\n\r\nThis  makes  it more critical to develop among them a  sense  of\r\n\r\nSingaporean identity and belonging through learning  the  mother\r\n\r\ntongue.   But it also means being more careful to make realistic\r\n\r\ndemands  on pupils learning CL, so that parents do not associate\r\n\r\na Singaporean education with burdensome CL requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a counterbalancing factor is the continued rapid growth\r\n\r\nand opening up of China.  China will be a major global player in\r\n\r\nthe  next century.  A command of CL will be a valuable asset for\r\n\r\nmany  jobs and careers, even if the person does not live or work\r\n\r\nin China.  This is true of the public service, and will be so in\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector  also.   Singaporeans  brought  up  to   be\r\n\r\nbilingual  will  be at a significant advantage.   This  gives  a\r\n\r\npractical  purpose to learning CL, and will motivate  pupils  to\r\n\r\nmaster the language.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Approach to teaching Chinese</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want every Singaporean to study his mother tongue in school\r\n\r\nfor as long as possible, and to as high a level as he is capable\r\n\r\nof.  The human brain has a finite capacity.  Only a minority  of\r\n\r\npeople - at most 10-15% of the population - have the IQ and  the\r\n\r\naptitude  for  languages to master two languages  equally  well.\r\n\r\nEven fewer can think in more than one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlanguage.   But  most people can master one language  well,  and\r\n\r\nhave a working knowledge of a second.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our schools, English is the main medium of instruction, and\r\n\r\nmust  be  learnt  at the first language level.  For  the  mother\r\n\r\ntongue,  we want pupils who can also to do it at first  language\r\n\r\nlevel,  or  close  to  it.  For the rest of the  pupils,  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  instruction  will have to be at second  language  level.\r\n\r\nWhat  this  second language level consists of  is  an  empirical\r\n\r\nquestion,  not a matter of opinion or dogma.  It is what  pupils\r\n\r\nof  average  ability can achieve with a reasonable effort.   But\r\n\r\nwhether  a  pupil  learns his mother tongue at first  or  second\r\n\r\nlanguage level, we will provide him the support, facilities, and\r\n\r\nincentives to make the effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach to teaching the mother tongue, applied to Chinese,\r\n\r\nwill  enable us to nurture a Chinese cultural elite,  especially\r\n\r\nfrom  among  those who have taken Higher Chinese and studied  in\r\n\r\nSAP schools.  It will also help us build a broad base of Chinese\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  have  learnt CL, and  will  continue  to  use\r\n\r\nChinese beyond the formal education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effort required of pupils to study CL must be comparable to\r\n\r\nthe   effort  required  for  other  subjects.   It   cannot   be\r\n\r\ndisproportionate.   In  terms  of  results  at   key   milestone\r\n\r\nexaminations,  there is no major problem with CL.   Most  pupils\r\n\r\nscore  good  grades for CL, indeed even better than for  English\r\n\r\nLanguage.  But this is not the full story.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education commissioned Forbes Research to do a\r\n\r\nsurvey  of  teachers, students and parents on the  teaching  and\r\n\r\nlearning  of CL.  The survey found that many pupils are spending\r\n\r\nmore  time  studying  CL than other subjects.   Pupils  who  are\r\n\r\nstrong in other subjects but weak in Chinese spend almost  twice\r\n\r\nas  much time outside of school studying Chinese as Mathematics.\r\n\r\nMore  surprisingly, even students who are strong in  Chinese  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  all other subjects spend almost 40% more time studying\r\n\r\nChinese  than  Mathematics, and 20% more time  studying  Chinese\r\n\r\nthan English.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education is working to re-orientate the entire\r\n\r\neducation system to an ability-driven paradigm.  It is designing\r\n\r\nmass customisation models to allow each pupil to proceed as  far\r\n\r\nas  he can in the areas in which he excels.  This applies to all\r\n\r\nsubjects.  We will adopt a more customised strategy to  teaching\r\n\r\nCL  in  line with this overall approach.  We will set  different\r\n\r\ntarget  levels of achievement for pupils of different abilities,\r\n\r\nbased  on what pupils of that ability level can attain  given  a\r\n\r\nreasonable amount of effort.  This will encourage each pupil  to\r\n\r\nstrive for the highest standard that he is capable of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some pupils are not academically outstanding all-round, but they\r\n\r\nhave  a  strong  aptitude and interest in  Chinese.   We  should\r\n\r\nprovide them with encouragement and opportunities to study  HCL.\r\n\r\nMany academically outstanding pupils do HCL.  But they often  go\r\n\r\non to study subjects like engineering or law, and pursue careers\r\n\r\nin business or government where they no longer use much Chinese.\r\n\r\nFewer  take  up  professional  careers  centred  around  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage or culture, for example, in teaching, the media, or the\r\n\r\narts.  Encouraging more students whose academic results are good\r\n\r\nbut  perhaps not quite as outstanding to study HCL will help  to\r\n\r\nbuild up a functional Chinese elite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are also talented pupils who are not\r\n\r\nable  to cope with existing CL standards, even though they  have\r\n\r\nhigh cognitive ability, do well in all their other subjects, and\r\n\r\nhave  good  potential to contribute to Singapore when they  grow\r\n\r\nup.   We  should  not turn these pupils against CL.   We  should\r\n\r\nencourage  them  to develop an interest and  a  basic  level  of\r\n\r\nmastery, which they can build on later if they need to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pupils who have exceptional difficulties coping with CL are a\r\n\r\nsmall  minority. But we cannot ignore their problems.  They  are\r\n\r\noverwhelmingly male (in fact, three quarters or more are males).\r\n\r\nMost but not all are from English-speaking homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all pupils have the same home environment or natural ability\r\n\r\nin  learning  CL.  We must recognise the large difference  which\r\n\r\nthe home language makes to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlearning  CL.  A CL syllabus may present no problem to  a  child\r\n\r\nwho  speaks  Chinese  at home.  Chinese is probably  his  master\r\n\r\nlanguage.  His CL lessons reinforce and formalise words, phrases\r\n\r\nand  grammar  which, in fact, he already knows.   But  the  same\r\n\r\nsyllabus  can  be extremely challenging for a child  who  speaks\r\n\r\nEnglish  at home, uses Chinese only occasionally outside  class,\r\n\r\nand  for  whom  far from being a master language, Chinese  is  a\r\n\r\ntotally new language which has to be learnt from scratch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also very significant that most of the pupils who are very\r\n\r\nweak  in Chinese are boys.  This shows that the problem of  this\r\n\r\ngroup is not just lack of motivation, or not trying hard enough.\r\n\r\nIt  reflects  innate differences between males and  females,  in\r\n\r\nbrain  function and aptitude for learning languages.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nwell  established fact that girls are much better  at  languages\r\n\r\nthan  boys.   We  must acknowledge and allow for  this  reality.\r\n\r\nEven in this House, the ladies do very well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides customising the CL requirements to suit pupils of\r\n\r\ndifferent  abilities,  in teaching CL  we  need  to  achieve  an\r\n\r\nappropriate  balance  among the language  skills  of  listening,\r\n\r\nspeaking,  reading  and writing, what they  call  in  Chinese  (\r\n\r\n)  (ting, shuo, du, xie).  In adult life, most Singaporeans will\r\n\r\nmore  often speak and hear Chinese than read Chinese,  and  more\r\n\r\noften  read  than  write  Chinese.   So  CL  teaching,  and   CL\r\n\r\nexaminations,  should emphasise more on listening  and  speaking\r\n\r\nskills,  and  also on reading skills.  For Higher  Chinese,  the\r\n\r\npresent  emphasis on all four skills, including writing,  should\r\n\r\nbe maintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support this approach to CL, we need appropriate\r\n\r\nmarkers,  signals and incentives.  We need to encourage students\r\n\r\nthrough many ways to make the effort to take CL seriously and do\r\n\r\ntheir  best.   We already have schemes to recognise  and  reward\r\n\r\nthose  who  excel  in  CL.  We must build  on  these.   We  will\r\n\r\nmaintain key requirements, such as requiring students to meet  a\r\n\r\ncertain minimum standard in CL\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nat  `O'  and  `A'  levels to proceed on to  junior  college  and\r\n\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Key Proposals</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me highlight the specific changes to Higher Chinese and\r\n\r\nChinese teaching following from the review:\r\n\r\nEncouraging More Students to Study Higher Chinese\r\n\r\nPresently,  Higher Chinese is offered by 22%  of  upper  primary\r\n\r\nschool  pupils  and  12% of secondary school students.  We  will\r\n\r\nencourage more students to study Higher Chinese, as this will be\r\n\r\nthe source of the future Chinese elite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In primary schools we will relax the criteria for allowing\r\n\r\npupils  to  take  Higher Chinese.  They can do  so  provided  at\r\n\r\nPrimary  4 streaming they score Band 1 in Chinese Language,  and\r\n\r\nat least Band 2 in English and Mathematics.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Admission to SAP Schools</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be more liberal in allowing pupils to take Higher\r\n\r\nChinese,  at  both  primary and secondary levels.  In  secondary\r\n\r\nschools,  currently only students who score in the  top  10%  of\r\n\r\nPSLE, or who score within the next 10% and show their ability to\r\n\r\nhandle  both  English  and  Chinese are  allowed  to  do  Higher\r\n\r\nChinese.   We will broaden this to the top 30% of PSLE students,\r\n\r\nsubject to similar conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the top 10% of PSLE students are offered a second\r\n\r\nchance  to  opt  for  SAP schools after  the  PSLE  results  are\r\n\r\npublished.  This is called the \"Second Option\".  We will broaden\r\n\r\nthis  \"Second  Option\" to the top 30% of PSLE students  who  are\r\n\r\neligible to offer Higher Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, these changes should increase the proportion of pupils\r\n\r\nstudying  Higher Chinese, especially at secondary  school.   How\r\n\r\nmany  actually opt for Higher Chinese will depend on the pupils'\r\n\r\nchoices,  but  we  hope  to  raise the proportion  in  secondary\r\n\r\nschools from the current 12% to perhaps 15-20%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Admission to Junior College</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, all students who obtain a pass in Higher Chinese are\r\n\r\ngiven  two  bonus  points for JC admission.  To  encourage  more\r\n\r\nstudents  to  take  up the Chinese Language  Elective  Programme\r\n\r\n(LEP),  we  will award two additional bonus points for admission\r\n\r\ninto JC to students who enrol in the LEP programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>University</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At university, we will follow through to encourage more students\r\n\r\nto  continue  doing Chinese at the polytechnic  and  university.\r\n\r\nThe  number  majoring in Chinese Language or Chinese Studies  is\r\n\r\nunlikely to be large.  But our tertiary institutions offer other\r\n\r\ncourses  where  Chinese is useful, and ECAs related  to  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage and culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS has undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage   and  Chinese  Studies.   It  runs  two  popular   MBA\r\n\r\nprogrammes  in  Mandarin which cater to the  needs  of  Chinese-speaking  Singaporeans  and  foreigners.   NTU  offers   Chinese\r\n\r\nelectives to balance the mainly technological orientation of its\r\n\r\nundergraduate   courses,  and  to  broaden   its   undergraduate\r\n\r\neducation.   The  polytechnics offer electives  and  modules  on\r\n\r\nChinese  language and culture. Some polytechnic courses  contain\r\n\r\nmodules  conducted in Chinese.  There are active  Chinese  dance\r\n\r\nand  drama  groups  and  Chinese orchestras  on  university  and\r\n\r\npolytechnic campuses.  A small number of students visit China as\r\n\r\nexchange students on study tours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE is exploring with the universities the possibility of\r\n\r\nintroducing bonus points for entry into Chinese Studies  in  NUS\r\n\r\nfor  those  strong  in Chinese.  It is also  exploring  offering\r\n\r\nbonus  points for those who enter Communications Studies in  NTU\r\n\r\nfor  those  strong in mother tongue, not just  Chinese  but  any\r\n\r\nmother tongue, at the AO- and A-Level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities and polytechnics will strive to expand the\r\n\r\nrange  of options available, so that even those students who  do\r\n\r\nnot focus on Chinese language and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nculture  can  keep up their interest in Chinese and  use  it  to\r\n\r\nvaluable advantage in their careers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Developing More Schools with a Stronger Chinese Environment</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we will develop more schools with a stronger Chinese\r\n\r\nenvironment.  We will enhance the SAP programme to  improve  its\r\n\r\neffectiveness  and reach. Both good academic performance  and  a\r\n\r\nrich  Chinese  environment  are  important  attributes  of   SAP\r\n\r\nschools.   The nine schools were chosen in 1979, 20  years  ago.\r\n\r\nThey  have  helped  to  preserve the best  of  the  old  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools.   But  the  list of nine schools has not  been  updated\r\n\r\nsince,  although the geographical distribution of the population\r\n\r\nhas shifted, and the schools have developed at different paces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reviewed the nine SAP schools. Most are doing well, both\r\n\r\nacademically  and in terms of cultural enrichment.   However,  a\r\n\r\nfew  of  them have rather low proportions of students qualifying\r\n\r\nto  take  Higher  Chinese,  and have fallen  in  their  academic\r\n\r\nrankings.  MOE has discussed the problem with these SAP schools,\r\n\r\nand will work with them to help them improve their standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will therefore retain all nine existing SAP schools on the\r\n\r\nprogramme.   But in addition, we will make Nan Hua  Secondary  a\r\n\r\n10th  SAP school.  Nan Hua will help to cater for the additional\r\n\r\nPSLE students who will now be given a Second Option to apply for\r\n\r\na  SAP  secondary school, but who may not be admitted  into  the\r\n\r\nmost  popular SAP schools.  Nan Hua is also in Clementi, in  the\r\n\r\nWestern  part of the island, whereas most existing  SAP  schools\r\n\r\nare in the Eastern half of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Junior College level, we will set up a third centre for\r\n\r\nthe Chinese Language Elective Programme (LEP), at Nanyang Junior\r\n\r\nCollege,  as  the  Minister for Education announced  last  week.\r\n\r\nThere are two existing LEP programmes which are in Hwa Chong  JC\r\n\r\nand Temasek JC.  However, Nanyang JC will continue to accept non-Chinese students.  Indeed it has vibrant non-Chinese cultural\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   It  organises  a dikir barat  competition  and  an\r\n\r\nIndian drama festival every year, and I hope it will continue to\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cultural Content of Chinese Syllabus</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the purpose of teaching Chinese is not purely utilitarian,\r\n\r\nbut to transmit heritage and values, the cultural content of the\r\n\r\ntextbooks is important. While learning the language, we want the\r\n\r\npupils  to  pick  up stories and fables, learn about  historical\r\n\r\ncharacters, and imbibe lessons for life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reviewed the contents of the CL and Higher Chinese\r\n\r\ntextbooks.  Compared to the textbooks which they  replaced,  the\r\n\r\npresent ones are far richer and more interesting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we can improve the cultural content of the textbooks\r\n\r\nfurther.  MOE will do so progressively as part of its curriculum\r\n\r\nreview  process.  In addition, we will introduce  an  enrichment\r\n\r\ncourse, \"Introduction to Appreciation of Chinese\", for all lower\r\n\r\nsecondary students in SAP schools, that means, Secondary  1  and\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have to be mindful to maintain a balance between\r\n\r\nincluding more cultural material, and helping students to master\r\n\r\nthe  basics  of  the  language.  For example,  we  explored  the\r\n\r\npossibility of reintroducing a few passages of classical Chinese\r\n\r\nor  wen  yen  into  the HCL textbooks. But  the  advice  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers  and  professionals was that the students  today  would\r\n\r\nhave  difficulty  coping  with them. We  also  cannot  make  the\r\n\r\ncontents  so  dense with cultural messages and historical  facts\r\n\r\nthat pupils cease to relate to them.  We must teach Chinese as a\r\n\r\nliving language to be used in our daily lives, and not something\r\n\r\nfrom the past of antiquarian interest that is no longer relevant\r\n\r\nto the present.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Achievable CL Standards</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new textbooks for CL were written after the Committee\r\n\r\nchaired by Mr Ong Teng Cheong had completed work and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublished  their report.  Since their introduction of these  new\r\n\r\ntextbooks in schools, MOE has received feedback from parents and\r\n\r\nteachers  that the new textbooks are significantly  harder  than\r\n\r\nthe  old  ones  which  they replaced.  This  had  not  been  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  the Committee. Its aim had been  to  improve  the\r\n\r\ncultural  content  of  the textbooks, and  not  to  raise  their\r\n\r\ndifficulty level.  We therefore convened a panel of professional\r\n\r\neducators  to  review  the  level  of  the  new  textbooks,  and\r\n\r\nspecifically to compare them with old ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel confirmed unambiguously that the new CL textbooks were\r\n\r\nsignificantly  harder, in terms of words and  phrases,  grammar,\r\n\r\ncontent, length of passages, and overall workload on students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has to be remedied. We will revise the primary and\r\n\r\nsecondary  CL  textbooks.  We will rewrite them to preserve  the\r\n\r\ncultural content, but pitched at a level of difficulty  that  is\r\n\r\nrealistically  achievable  by  the  majority  of  students  with\r\n\r\nreasonable  effort.  Simplifying the language of  the  textbooks\r\n\r\nwill  make their content more accessible to students.  This will\r\n\r\nlighten their load, and restore the CL standard to roughly  what\r\n\r\nit was before the present textbooks were introduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rewriting the CL textbooks will take some time. Meanwhile, as\r\n\r\nan  interim  measure, schools will continue to use  the  present\r\n\r\ntextbooks, but will skip certain of the more difficult passages.\r\n\r\nMOE  has  identified the passages to be excised, and will  brief\r\n\r\nschools and parents and pupils on the details.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for HCL textbooks, the panel has found that the new textbooks\r\n\r\nare  also  more difficult than the ones they replaced.  However,\r\n\r\nfeedback from schools is that HCL students are generally  coping\r\n\r\nwith them.  We will therefore not be rewriting the HCL textbooks\r\n\r\nto reduce their level of difficulty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem of textbooks having become harder raises the\r\n\r\nquestion whether examination standards have similarly crept  up.\r\n\r\nPupils and parents will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  reassured  to  learn that CL examinations  have  not  become\r\n\r\nharder.   We  have  verified  that  examination  standards  have\r\n\r\nremained  constant,  especially  the  key  PSLE  and  `O'  level\r\n\r\nexaminations, as indeed was the intention all along.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we will be revising the design and format of the PSLE\r\n\r\nCL  examinations,  to give greater weighting  to  listening  and\r\n\r\nspeaking  skills,  and  to  test the skills  that  we  want  the\r\n\r\nchildren to learn. The type and nature of examination items will\r\n\r\nbe  revised.   There  should be a core of  questions  that  most\r\n\r\nreasonably  proficient students will be able to  answer,  and  a\r\n\r\nnumber of more difficult questions to discriminate students  who\r\n\r\nare  above average and those who are outstanding from those  who\r\n\r\nare  average.  The overall standard expected of pupils  will  be\r\n\r\nmaintained at the present level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will also review the `O' level CL examination\r\n\r\nformat, but our preliminary conclusion is that the changes  will\r\n\r\nbe fewer than for the PSLE CL examination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in examination and textbooks will be introduced and\r\n\r\nimplemented  with  sufficient  notice  to  pupils,  parents  and\r\n\r\nteachers to make the necessary adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Pupils Weak in CL</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjustment to the CL standard will mean the vast majority of\r\n\r\npupils  should be able to cope with CL.  However,  it  will  not\r\n\r\nsolve  the  problem of the minority of pupils who find  it  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  cope with CL even though they have no  difficulty\r\n\r\nwith  other  subjects in school.  Their number  is  still  quite\r\n\r\nsmall,  but  the  proportion  of English  speaking  families  is\r\n\r\ngrowing.  If we ignore the real problems these children have  in\r\n\r\nlearning  Chinese, they are likely to develop a lasting aversion\r\n\r\nto  the  language and culture, which will be counter productive.\r\n\r\nWorse,  public  support  for the CL  policy  from  parents  will\r\n\r\nweaken, and the Government will come under pressure to lower  CL\r\n\r\nstandards across the board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this problem, we will introduce an alternative CL `B'\r\n\r\nsyllabus,  at the secondary and JC levels, for these  pupils  to\r\n\r\ntake.   This  should  help  them to  attain  a  basic  level  of\r\n\r\nproficiency  in  CL,  and hopefully instil in  them  a  positive\r\n\r\ninterest in Chinese culture, traditions and values.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  it will enable us to maintain a higher standard  for  the\r\n\r\nmajority of pupils who have no difficulty coping with the Higher\r\n\r\nChinese and CL syllabi.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CL `B' syllabus will be similar in teaching and content to\r\n\r\nCL,  but  with  simpler  texts and a  smaller  word  list.   The\r\n\r\nexamination  format will give greater weightage to listening  to\r\n\r\nand speaking Chinese, as these are skills that are likely to  be\r\n\r\nof most use to this group of pupils later on in life.  A pass in\r\n\r\nCL  `B'  syllabus  at  the `O' and `A' level  examinations  will\r\n\r\nqualify students to enter JC and university. However, the CL `B'\r\n\r\nsyllabus  result  cannot  be  used  to  compute  the  `O'  level\r\n\r\naggregate  for admission into JC, or earn any `A'  level  points\r\n\r\nused for university admission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided against introducing CL `B' syllabus at the primary\r\n\r\nlevel. We want to encourage all Chinese pupils to strive  to  do\r\n\r\nwell in CL and not give up easily, as our policy objective is to\r\n\r\nhave  all  Chinese Singaporeans learn CL for as long as possible\r\n\r\nand  to as high a level as possible.  Currently, weak pupils are\r\n\r\nputting  in extra effort at the PSLE, and the results show  that\r\n\r\nthe vast majority are coping.  MOE will monitor the situation in\r\n\r\nprimary  schools  and  re-consider this if  a  problem  develops\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CL `B' syllabus is not intended as a soft option in lieu of\r\n\r\nCL.   MOE will work out safeguards and incentives to ensure that\r\n\r\nstudents who are able to cope with CL will continue to offer CL,\r\n\r\nand  not opt for CL `B' syllabus.  MOE estimates that 80-90%  of\r\n\r\neach cohort should be capable of doing Higher Chinese or CL,  so\r\n\r\nonly a minority will need to do CL `B' syllabus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE will work out the implementation details for this new\r\n\r\nsyllabus.   CL `B' can be made available to pupils  sitting  for\r\n\r\ntheir  GCE  `O'  and  `A' level examinations  in  2001,  at  the\r\n\r\nearliest.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Mother Tongues</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our review has focused on Chinese Language, the\r\n\r\nphilosophy  and  approach behind the CL  policy  framework  also\r\n\r\napplies,  with  suitable  modifications,  to  the  teaching  and\r\n\r\nlearning of other mother tongue languages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has started to review the Tamil Language syllabus to\r\n\r\nensure  that the standard is appropriate and not too  difficult.\r\n\r\nWe  will  introduce `B' syllabus for Tamil and  Malay,  if  this\r\n\r\nproves necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policies I have outlined are a refinement and updating\r\n\r\nof  the  existing framework, not a dramatic change.   They  will\r\n\r\nguide  the teaching and learning of Chinese Language in schools.\r\n\r\nThey  will  provide pupils and parents, teachers and  curriculum\r\n\r\nspecialists   a  clear  understanding  of  the  principles   and\r\n\r\nrationale behind the Government's policies on Chinese Language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will help to maintain a Chinese cultural\r\n\r\nelite  as  one important component to our multi-racial  society.\r\n\r\nThey  will also give all Chinese Singaporeans enough mastery  of\r\n\r\nCL  to acquire the cultural values and heritage that are part of\r\n\r\nour social DNA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift in language patterns among Singaporeans reflects\r\n\r\nthe  broader changes in Singapore society.  We have undergone  a\r\n\r\nmomentous   transformation   in   one   generation    and    the\r\n\r\ntransformation  is  far  from  over.   Singapore  society   must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to adapt, to stay abreast and relevant to  the  global\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to review our mother tongue policies\r\n\r\nregularly, to take into account the continuing evolution of  our\r\n\r\nsociety,  changes in the external environment, as  well  as  new\r\n\r\nresearch  into  language  learning.  A  flexible  and  realistic\r\n\r\napproach to teaching and learning mother tongues will keep  them\r\n\r\nalive  and flourishing in Singapore and help us to maintain  our\r\n\r\nAsian heritage and identity in a rapidly changing world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that some Members\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  debate  my statement  and  in  accordance  with\r\n\r\nStanding Order No. 42, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after\r\n\r\nhearing  Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, I fully  support\r\n\r\nthe  view taken in the shift that the Government is to make with\r\n\r\nregard to the teaching and learning of the Chinese Language.   I\r\n\r\nthink the conditions are right for the Education Ministry to set\r\n\r\nthe  minimum  attainable standards in Chinese  Language  and  to\r\n\r\nallow parents the choice to decide the pace and level of Chinese\r\n\r\nproficiency  for their children without impacting their  overall\r\n\r\neducational attainment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today parents need no persuasion to have their\r\n\r\nchildren  learn  the  Chinese  Language.   I  think  all  of  us\r\n\r\nunderstand the value, the usefulness and importance of  learning\r\n\r\nthe Chinese Language.  I am glad that the Education Ministry has\r\n\r\ntaken, as what DPM has mentioned, the ability driven approach in\r\n\r\nthe  learning  of all subjects, including the Chinese  Language,\r\n\r\nand  the ability for the Education Ministry to want to customise\r\n\r\nlearning to match the pace and capability of the child.  This is\r\n\r\na  very  laudable move and it is not going to be easy.  But  the\r\n\r\nfact that the Ministry is emboldened to make this ambitious step\r\n\r\nis laudable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other interesting development, as I heard DPM Lee,\r\n\r\nis the use of incentives for students.  I think we are trying to\r\n\r\nremove the need to use disincentives or, in fact, penalties,  if\r\n\r\nstudents do not do well and instead take the approach of  giving\r\n\r\nincentives or, what we heard just now, bonus points for students\r\n\r\nwho  have  done  well  in language.  This is  a  right  approach\r\n\r\nbecause  if  we were to provide incentives, there would  be  the\r\n\r\ncommitment on the children and parents in wanting to do well.  I\r\n\r\nam  very sure that this will encourage and motivate the students\r\n\r\nto  strive  for  even a higher level of attainment.   This  also\r\n\r\nrecognises that every child has got different aptitudes and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifferent  talents and it is important for us in our educational\r\n\r\npolicies  and system to allow for a variety of fields  that  can\r\n\r\naccommodate the different talents, capabilities and aptitudes of\r\n\r\nour children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, language learning is a life-long effort and what is\r\n\r\nvery  important is not to kill the interest of our children  and\r\n\r\nto  develop an aversion to language learning.  To allow a  child\r\n\r\nto  learn a language at his own pace and to give him the time to\r\n\r\ndo  it is important because later on in adult life, when he sees\r\n\r\na  need in wanting to polish and brush up the language, it  will\r\n\r\nnot  be difficult for him to do so.  I am glad that while laying\r\n\r\nthe  foundation of the children for primary education, we  allow\r\n\r\nthem  the  pace to attain the level necessary later on in  adult\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that resources and time are limited, and\r\n\r\nwe  have  to be very focused in the kind of outcomes we want  to\r\n\r\nachieve  in  the teaching and learning of the Chinese  Language.\r\n\r\nWe  have  heard  just now how students have spent an  inordinate\r\n\r\namount  of  time in Chinese with little beneficial  result  and,\r\n\r\nworse, at the expense of other subjects.  And we have heard that\r\n\r\nwhat  is  important in the Chinese Language is for us to achieve\r\n\r\nlistening, speaking and reading skills first, and later  on,  if\r\n\r\nthey  do  better,  to  move  on to writing  skills.   These  are\r\n\r\ngenerally  the usefulness and the value of Chinese Language  for\r\n\r\nthe majority of Singaporeans and it is important that we look at\r\n\r\nthe  needs and usefulness to the average Singaporeans.  I  fully\r\n\r\nsupport this move because it is very realistic and practical.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lastly, if I may add, one of the difficulties with\r\n\r\nregard  to  the learning of the Chinese Language by students  is\r\n\r\nreally  the delivery, ie, the teaching methodology.  It is  here\r\n\r\nthat  the  teachers  can play their part to make  their  lessons\r\n\r\ninteresting,  the  subject content relevant, and  encourage  the\r\n\r\nchildren to learn the language.  And I hope that the teachers in\r\n\r\nthe Chinese Language will do their best in this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin Hock)</b>\r\n\r\n<b></b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Singa-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npore has pursued the bilingual policy for more  than\r\n\r\n30  years.   How  many bilingual talents have we nurtured?   The\r\n\r\npopulation census in the year 2000 will be able to give  us  the\r\n\r\nstatistical figures with regard to bilingual Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that in the Education Ministry's survey on the\r\n\r\nstudents' background, other than \"English\", \"Mother Tongue\"  and\r\n\r\n\"Dialect\", an additional category of \"Bilingual\" be placed under\r\n\r\n\"Language Used at Home\". I believe that there are many  families\r\n\r\nnowadays who use two languages at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the survival and development of our country and\r\n\r\nsociety,  the bilingual policy should stay. This direction  must\r\n\r\nnot change. However, at present there are two trends that affect\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of the bilingual policy. The first trend  is\r\n\r\nthe  rise of China. As China's international stature grows  with\r\n\r\neach  passing  day,  and as it becomes an  economic  power,  the\r\n\r\npractical  value  of  spoken  and  written  Chinese  is  greatly\r\n\r\nenhanced, and the status of Chinese culture is also raised.  The\r\n\r\nresult  of  this is that more parents are willing to  let  their\r\n\r\nchildren learn Chinese, even Higher Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the vast majority of parents agree that by\r\n\r\nlearning  Chinese, their children can at the  same  time  absorb\r\n\r\nChinese  culture and traditional values. Moreover, Chinese  also\r\n\r\nhas  practical  value  in economics, the media  and  Cyberspace.\r\n\r\nWhatever the motives or intentions for learning Chinese may  be,\r\n\r\nthis  external trend will have a positive effect on the learning\r\n\r\nand the usage of Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another trend is the change in the linguistic profile\r\n\r\nin Singapore homes. In 1988, 15 per cent of the Chinese students\r\n\r\ncame  from  English-speaking families. In 1998, this number  has\r\n\r\nincreased  to 33 per cent. If we consider only the  Primary  One\r\n\r\nstudents, the percentage of students who are of English-speaking\r\n\r\nfamily background increased from 20 per cent to 40 per cent over\r\n\r\nthe  past ten years. This figure will continue to grow with each\r\n\r\npassing year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these Chinese students from English-speaking families face great difficulties when they learn\r\n\r\nChinese  because  they  lack the support of  a  Chinese-speaking\r\n\r\nbackground  at  home.  This trend has negative  effects  on  the\r\n\r\nlearning of Chinese in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Different students have different abilities</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short run, we cannot determine the net result of the\r\n\r\nconvergence  of  these two different trends. But the  undeniable\r\n\r\nreality  is:  different students will have different  abilities,\r\n\r\ninterests  and  motives in learning the different subjects.  The\r\n\r\naptitude  for  mathematics and science is often quite  different\r\n\r\nfrom the aptitude for learning languages. Moreover, the language\r\n\r\nspoken  at  home and the environment at school also  affect  the\r\n\r\nstudents'   interest  and  ability  in  learning   a   language.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is impractical to demand that all students  attain\r\n\r\nsimilar results in all their various subjects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the focus of Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's\r\n\r\nproposed  framework for Chinese education is on  having  a  more\r\n\r\nflexible  approach in teaching Chinese. This  puts  into  effect\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  Goh Chok Tong's proposal for a  Chinese  elite,\r\n\r\nsuggested  in his 1997 National Day Rally. This also solves  the\r\n\r\nproblem of the difficulties faced by some students from English-speaking homes in learning Chinese, referred to in PM's speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will allow and encourage more\r\n\r\nChinese  students to opt for Higher Chinese. It  is  setting  up\r\n\r\nanother  Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school, and starting  the\r\n\r\nthird  Language  Elective  Programme  (LEP)  at  Nanyang  Junior\r\n\r\nCollege.  It  is also giving these students more incentives  and\r\n\r\nrewards   as  they  enter  junior  colleges  and  even  tertiary\r\n\r\neducational institutions.  For those students who are interested\r\n\r\nin  and have the aptitude for Chinese, this package will provide\r\n\r\nthem  with more opportunities to improve the standards of  their\r\n\r\nChinese. This package\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould   be  welcomed  by   the   Chinese-speaking\r\n\r\ncommunity.  It also satisfies the need for nurturing  a  Chinese\r\n\r\nelite for the next generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Fewer candidates for Chinese Literature</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education should also encourage those\r\n\r\nstudents  with the interest and the ability to take  up  Chinese\r\n\r\nLiterature  besides Higher Chinese. During the opening  ceremony\r\n\r\nfor the 1997 Speak Mandarin Campaign, DPM Lee mentioned that out\r\n\r\nof  28,000  Chinese students taking the `O' Levels,  only  2,500\r\n\r\ntook  the  Higher  Chinese paper. The number of  candidates  for\r\n\r\nChinese  Literature was even more dismal - a mere 500.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  English Literature candidates was  11,000.  The\r\n\r\nChinese   elite  ought  to  have  some  knowledge   of   Chinese\r\n\r\nLiterature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we cannot ignore those students who have\r\n\r\nspecial problems in learning Chinese. In the announced framework\r\n\r\nfor teaching CL, they will be allowed to opt for the Chinese \"B\"\r\n\r\nSyllabus  paper  (CLB), so as to reduce the pressure  they  face\r\n\r\nwhen  they  learn Chinese. I believe that this  policy  will  be\r\n\r\nwelcomed by the parents of these students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the worry of the Chinese-speaking community is\r\n\r\nthis: if the choice were to be entirely left to the parents, the\r\n\r\nnumber of students who opt for CLB would increase in tandem with\r\n\r\nthe  increasing  number of English-speaking  households  in  the\r\n\r\nyears  to come. Will CLB become a \"soft-option\" subject? Whether\r\n\r\nthese  students should become part of a \"soft-option\"  syndrome?\r\n\r\nThere are causes for worry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Ministry of Education should lay down a\r\n\r\nclear  set of rules to prevent such an occurrence. For instance,\r\n\r\nthe  school  will have to assess and decide whether the  student\r\n\r\nwho  does  well for all other subjects except Chinese is  unable\r\n\r\nand not unwilling (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) to\r\n\r\nimprove  his or her Chinese grades. Only then can he or she  opt\r\n\r\nfor  CLB.  Students opting for CLB must also consider that  they\r\n\r\nwill have to continue taking it in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njunior colleges.  Their schools will not allow  them\r\n\r\nto  switch to taking Chinese as a Second Language (CL2)  as  and\r\n\r\nwhen they like it. In a nutshell, the framework for teaching  CL\r\n\r\nnot  only encourages students to take up Higher Chinese and CL2,\r\n\r\nit must also set certain restrictions on students taking the CLB\r\n\r\noption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under present circumstances, I believe most Chinese\r\n\r\nstudents  will  still  choose CL2. When the  Education  Ministry\r\n\r\nrevised  the CL2 syllabus, its guiding principle was to simplify\r\n\r\nthe  language  to make it easier to learn, without changing  the\r\n\r\ncultural content. On the whole, this can be achieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Zaobao's language more accessible</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a precedent. Years ago, the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nrequested  that the Chinese newspapers simplify their  language.\r\n\r\nAfter years of effort, Lianhe Zaobao's language has become  more\r\n\r\naccessible   and   readable,  and  its   contents   varied   and\r\n\r\ninformative. It is also one of the more authoritative newspapers\r\n\r\nin the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the setting of the syllabus must be guided\r\n\r\nby  two  important principles. The first is to transmit  culture\r\n\r\nand  the  right  values.  The  other  is  to  make  the  lessons\r\n\r\ninteresting.  We  need not be too insistent in other  areas.  In\r\n\r\n1997, I went through eight Higher Chinese textbooks (a total  of\r\n\r\n160  lessons) in two days. I really have to take my hat  off  to\r\n\r\nthe people who compile these textbooks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do these lessons have to transmit cultural content\r\n\r\nand  values, the lessons themselves aim to be as diversified  as\r\n\r\npossible  in  literary form. Besides poetry, novels and  essays,\r\n\r\nthey also include formatted writing such as notices and letters.\r\n\r\nIn  terms  of subject matter, these lessons also aim to divesify\r\n\r\nto  meet  different needs, and they include issues ranging  from\r\n\r\nASEAN   economic  cooperation  and  Southeast  Asia  non-nuclear\r\n\r\nproliferation zone, to environmentalism and trade protectionism.\r\n\r\nBut  this is a thankless task.  The end result is that  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  lessons are boring and are not likely to stir the student's\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the compilation of Chinese lessons, there is\r\n\r\nactually  a  wide range to choose from . Besides Chinese  idioms\r\n\r\nand  popular poems, excerpts from vernacular novels of the  Ming\r\n\r\nand  Qing  Dynasties, Jin Yong's kungfu novels, the translations\r\n\r\nof  \"Aesop's  Fables\"  and Edmondo De  Amicis'  \"Cuore\"  can  be\r\n\r\nincluded,  as well as works by Yu Qiuyu, Cai Zhizhong,  Li  Lien\r\n\r\nFung,  You Jin, Ng Wai Choy and so on. The question is  deciding\r\n\r\nwhich  ones to use and how to get the students interested.  Most\r\n\r\nof  the  lessons must also include cultural content and transmit\r\n\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hope of the Chinese-speaking community is that all\r\n\r\nChinese students can achieve the highest achievable standards in\r\n\r\nCL.  All  the  Education Ministry can do  is  to  encourage  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the Chinese students to try their best  to  achieve\r\n\r\nthe  highest  standards  they  can  possibly  achieve.  But  the\r\n\r\nministry  can also encourage the more able students to  aim  for\r\n\r\nhigher standards, while at the same time enabling the less  able\r\n\r\nstudents to grasp the most basic Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using such a flexible method to teach Chinese will not only\r\n\r\nmake learning Chinese in schools more effective and interesting,\r\n\r\nmore  importantly, it can make them use Chinese even after  they\r\n\r\nleave their schools and make Chinese a living language.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in 1979 the\r\n\r\nGovernment  officially merged all the schools into one  national\r\n\r\nstream, with mother tongue listed as a compulsory subject in the\r\n\r\nschool's curriculum.  The Government also appointed a number  of\r\n\r\ntraditional  Chinese schools to become Special  Assistance  Plan\r\n\r\n(SAP)  schools to preserve the fine Chinese culture and  values.\r\n\r\nThis  bilingual policy has been in implementation for 20  years.\r\n\r\nToday, more people are speaking Mandarin than before.  In  terms\r\n\r\nof  quantum, the usage of Chinese has indeed increased. However,\r\n\r\nwith  the retirement of the older generation of Chinese-speaking\r\n\r\nintellects  who  had  worked  in the  cultural  and  educational\r\n\r\nfields, there seems to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na situation of the \"the new crop is  still  in  the\r\n\r\nblade  while the old one is all consumed\".  Despite the increase\r\n\r\nin  quantity,  the  quality  standard  of  Chinese  may  not  be\r\n\r\nmaintained.   On the other hand, some students have  encountered\r\n\r\nmany  difficulties in learning Chinese language, it is therefore\r\n\r\nnecessary to review and adjust Chinese curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his policy statement today, DPM Lee points out that\r\n\r\nalthough some students spend more time learning Chinese than  in\r\n\r\nother  subjects, the result is not satisfactory.  In fact,  some\r\n\r\nstudents could not even attain the lowest passing grade, but may\r\n\r\nbe quite good in other subjects such as Mathematics, Science and\r\n\r\nEnglish.  This  is  an illustration that the  ability  to  learn\r\n\r\nChinese  does not completely coincide with the ability to  learn\r\n\r\nother  subjects.   In  order  to  prevent  having  the  students\r\n\r\nspending  too  much  time on Chinese at  the  expense  of  other\r\n\r\nsubjects,  and to avoid the less-than-ideal results  in  Chinese\r\n\r\nhampering  the  academic future of some good students,  DPM  Lee\r\n\r\nproposed:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Revise the Chinese course curriculum to lighten the burden\r\n\r\nof learning; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Introduce a new CL `B' paper for those students who could\r\n\r\nnot cope with the learning of the ordinary CL course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These proposals warrant our careful consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many students are having difficulty learning Chinese, and\r\n\r\nsometimes  the  parents do complain about it. This  is  a  fact.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we must prescribe the right medicine for the ailment.\r\n\r\nMaking  the  appropriate revision and adjustment is a necessity.\r\n\r\nThe  question  is how to revise the curriculum without  lowering\r\n\r\nthe standard of Chinese. Will the introduction of CL `B' make it\r\n\r\ntoo  convenient for the students to swamp into opting  for  this\r\n\r\neasy  way out in place of CL?  Then, it will actually lower  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of Chinese!  Therefore, I hope that when the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education is revising the curriculum they will make  Chinese\r\n\r\neasy  to  learn, easy to understand, and yet at  the  same  time\r\n\r\nmaintain the present standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Ow that the revision must be\r\n\r\ncarried out with caution. The conditions for switching to CL `B'\r\n\r\nshould  be  restrictive and not too relaxed, so that there  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  too many students attracted to it.  If the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation can provide more incentives for those who stay  on  to\r\n\r\ndo  CL, then the number of students who want to shirk hard  work\r\n\r\nand take an easy one will naturally be less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it is necessary to maintain the standard of\r\n\r\nChinese,  different people may have different views.  Some  feel\r\n\r\nthat Chinese is not an administrative or business language.   So\r\n\r\nlearning  Chinese is of no practical use.  That being the  case,\r\n\r\nwhy should we force all the ethnic Chinese students in Singapore\r\n\r\nto  learn Chinese?  If you go to China to do business,  you  may\r\n\r\nneed  to use Chinese.  But they are only the minority.   Such  a\r\n\r\nreasoning  is not entirely groundless. As a matter of  fact,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, using English alone, you can still carry on with your\r\n\r\ncareer development.  However, the choices before us are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Continue to implement our bilingual policy; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Let it be gradually transformed into a monolingual policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to develop into a monolingual society where\r\n\r\neveryone  speaks only English, then our whole spiritual  outlook\r\n\r\nand  characteristics will be changed.  It will be more difficult\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  maintain our cultural traditions and  to  inculcate\r\n\r\ntraditional values.  Our linkage with the ethnic Chinese  people\r\n\r\nall over the world will be weakened.  It will be a great loss to\r\n\r\nour  personal development and collectively it will not  be  good\r\n\r\nfor the long term benefit of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Chinese community there may be some people who are\r\n\r\nstill  worried  that  this policy adjustment  may  result  in  a\r\n\r\nlowering  of  the  standard of the Chinese  language.   This  is\r\n\r\nsurely not the intent and purpose of the new measures.  DPM  Lee\r\n\r\nhas  just announced that the Government will be encouraging more\r\n\r\nstudents  to  take  Higher  Chinese, and  the  Chinese  Language\r\n\r\nElective  Programme  (LEP)  will be introduced  at  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nJunior College.  These new measures will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconducive to the maintenance  of  the  standard  of\r\n\r\nChinese,  and  have  a positive impact on  the  nurturing  of  a\r\n\r\nChinese elite.  Therefore, the worry is unnecessary.  As for  30\r\n\r\nyears  from now, would the status of the Chinese language remain\r\n\r\nthe  same as it is now in Singapore?  That would depend  on  how\r\n\r\nour next generation evaluate the value of Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the revised policy annonced today, we would\r\n\r\nenable  the  students to learn their mother tongue according  to\r\n\r\ntheir  abilities, bearing in mind that at least  a  basic  level\r\n\r\nmust be maintained.  This is a sensible and flexible policy, and\r\n\r\nit is worthy of our support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the policy statement by the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  welcome  and  support  the policy statement  by  DPM  Lee  in\r\n\r\nnurturing  a new generation of Chinese elite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised mother tongue policy will, on the one hand, give\r\n\r\nmore  students the opportunity to study Higher Chinese in  order\r\n\r\nthat a group of  Chinese elite may be nurtured in Singapore, and\r\n\r\non  the  other hand, continue to look after the interest of  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of students who are taking  CL so that they  will,  in\r\n\r\nthe  process  of learning Chinese, generate certain interest  in\r\n\r\nMandarin  Chinese, let them appreciate the connotative  meanings\r\n\r\nof the Chinese culture, and thereby moulding their integrity and\r\n\r\nfine cultivation. This is indeed commendable!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those who have special difficulty in learning Chinese, we\r\n\r\nhave also made special arrangement for them to take a simpler CL\r\n\r\n`B' paper, to lighten their burden of learning, and to encourage\r\n\r\nthem to continue to keep in contact with their mother tongue.  I\r\n\r\nthink this is also something that cannot be faulted.  As such, I\r\n\r\nsupport the policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in implementing this new policy, I have the following\r\n\r\nsuggestions for the Ministry of Education to study and consider:\r\n\r\nIn  the Higher Chinese lessons, students should be appropriately\r\n\r\ntaught the poli-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntical, economic, cultural and historical background\r\n\r\nof  China.   This  will  help the Chinese elite  have  a  fuller\r\n\r\nunderstanding of China by simultaneously adopting  the  Oriental\r\n\r\nand  Western perspectives.   To a certain degree, they  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to look at things Chinese - China's social formation,  the\r\n\r\nChinese  way  of thinking, the Chinese way of doing things  from\r\n\r\nthe  viewpoint of the Chinese people, and not just make comments\r\n\r\nor pass judgement from the angle of Singaporeans or Westerners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my experience in investing in China, I truly\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the  Chinese-educated from  Singapore  have  a\r\n\r\ndistinct advantage over others in China. They are like  fish  in\r\n\r\nthe  water.  They  have created many business opportunities  and\r\n\r\ninterests  beneficial  to Singapore.  But,  for  those  English-educated  from  Singapore,  they do not  understand  the  actual\r\n\r\nconditions  in  Singapore, and tried to apply the Singapore  and\r\n\r\nwestern management model and investment style in China.  In  the\r\n\r\nend, they run into a lot of trouble and problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the adaptability of the Chinese-educated\r\n\r\nand the English-educated in the China market and the reading  of\r\n\r\nthe  investment environment in China are closely linked to their\r\n\r\neducational background.  The Chinese-educated  are in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to  understand the Chinese culture, language, thinking\r\n\r\nand  way  of  doing  things, and make  flexible  adjustment  and\r\n\r\ncoordination  to  deal  with the problems encountered  in  their\r\n\r\ninvestment  projects.   I feel that for  Singaporeans  to  work,\r\n\r\ninvest  or do business in China, they must, first of all,  spend\r\n\r\nsome  time  to  study the four \"Great Classics\" in  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nliterature:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Dream of the Red Chamber. This thick book of a few\r\n\r\nthousand  pages paints a picture of the complexity of  the  huge\r\n\r\nextended family in ancient China. The story evolves around a big\r\n\r\nfamily  compound  known as Dai Guan Yuan  and  talks  about  the\r\n\r\nconflicts  and struggle among the clans within the  family,  and\r\n\r\nthe intricacies in coordinating and resolving these problems;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Water Margin. It enables you to\r\n\r\nunderstand the meaning of yi qi (righteousness), and  learn  how\r\n\r\n108 heroes' vastly different backgrounds could come together and\r\n\r\nbe united like brothers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Journey To the West. It tells you how imaginative the\r\n\r\nChinese  people were, even some centuries ago.  The  Monkey  God\r\n\r\ncould  pluck  a few hairs from his body, give them  a  blow  and\r\n\r\nhundreds  of little monkeys were cloned.  As far back as  a  few\r\n\r\nthousand  years  ago, the Chinese people had  already  had  this\r\n\r\nimagination of human-cloning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Romance of the Three Kingdoms. By reading this book,\r\n\r\nyou  will appreciate the high intelligence and clever strategies\r\n\r\nof  the  Chinese  people in their struggle for  power,  and  arm\r\n\r\nyourself with the proper tools to do business with the people in\r\n\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can enhance our students' knowledge of the Chinese culture\r\n\r\nthrough  our Higher Chinese lessons, this will be of great  help\r\n\r\nto  our  grooming  of  Chinese elite.   We can  also  choose  to\r\n\r\npublish simplified versions of all these four books suitable for\r\n\r\nchildren  and  teenagers, make them easier for our  students  to\r\n\r\nstudy them and thereby  enhancing their interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second approach is to find out the real reason why our\r\n\r\nstudents   are   having   problems  learning   Chinese.   Today,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  learn Chinese basically have  no  problem  in\r\n\r\nlistening  and speaking.  Most of them can understand and  speak\r\n\r\nsome  simple Mandarin.  But in reading and writing, they face  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  difficulties.  This is mainly because they do not  have\r\n\r\ntoo  many  opportunities  to get in  contact  with  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage but have generally more exposure to English language.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  discussed the problem of the learning  of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage  with my children, they told me that their standard  of\r\n\r\nEnglish  is much higher than that of their Chinese.  Even  then,\r\n\r\ncompared  to  other  students, my children are  more  fortunate,\r\n\r\nbecause in school, they have ample\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nopportunities to be exposed  to  English.   So  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  their English is quite good.  However,  they  were\r\n\r\nborn  in  a  Chinese-speaking family which is  rich  in  Chinese\r\n\r\ncultural  atmosphere.  Apart from good English, they  also  have\r\n\r\nquite  a  lot of exposure to Chinese (although I often criticize\r\n\r\ntheir   writing in  Chinese as being unreadable rubbish).  Their\r\n\r\nclassmates always feel that they are at a disadvantage when they\r\n\r\ncome to the learning of Chinese, because they were not born in a\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking family, and they therefore claim that it is not\r\n\r\nfair to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to urge the Government not to make it\r\n\r\ntoo easy for students from English-speaking families to drop the\r\n\r\nlearning  of  their  mother tongue.   Unless  it  is  absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary,  the  Government should  not  allow  the  parents  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  their  children from the normal CL course  and  switch\r\n\r\nthem  over  to  the lower CL `B' course. At the same  time,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  prescribe  the  medicine  according  to  the\r\n\r\nailment  and find out the reasons for these students' difficulty\r\n\r\nin  learning  Chinese.  Is it the textbook, the teaching  method\r\n\r\nand environment, or the attitude of the parents themselves?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I would like to raise another point concerning\r\n\r\nthe  teaching  of functional words, grammar, word discrimination\r\n\r\nand  rhetoric  in  Chinese.  I feel that we should  not  rigidly\r\n\r\nteach  these  things in our teaching materials. As a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfact, even after my graduation from the senior middle school,  I\r\n\r\ndid  not  know  there  were  such things  as  functional  words,\r\n\r\ngrammar, word discrimination or rhetoric in Chinese.  But  after\r\n\r\nI  graduated,  I  could write Chinese, I could read  Chinese,  I\r\n\r\ncould understand Chinese, and I could speak Chinese.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nin  the  teaching of Chinese, all materials  which unnecessarily\r\n\r\nadd on to the burden of the students should be expunged from the\r\n\r\ntextbooks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese word is an ideograph. Chinese is not a romanised\r\n\r\nlanguage.  One has to learn the individual Chinese characters to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  his vocabulary. There must be some ways to  make  the\r\n\r\nlearning  of Chinese characters interesting.  This is  something\r\n\r\nthat is lacking in our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChinese  textbooks. Perhaps  we  should  set  up  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  to oversee the preparation of textbooks, particularly\r\n\r\ntheir  contents.  The Government should not just  formulate  the\r\n\r\npolicy  and  let the writers have a free hand to write  whatever\r\n\r\nthey like.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third suggestion is that we should not let the Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity  feel  that the standard of Chinese will  be  lowered.\r\n\r\nThe  Chinese  community  is  most concerned  about  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nculture, Chinese values and the Chinese language, and they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  working very painstakingly and faithfully in  helping  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  preserve the Chinese cultural heritage.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  promote Higher Chinese, we must also  look  after  the\r\n\r\nsmall  minority  of  students who have  difficulty  in  learning\r\n\r\nChinese.  That is why the Ministry is setting a simpler  CL  `B'\r\n\r\npaper   for  these  students.   We  should  assure  the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity  that the standard of mother tongue in Singapore  will\r\n\r\nnot be lowered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, we must restrict the number of students opting\r\n\r\nfor  CL `B', as suggested by Dr Ow Chin Hock.  Only students who\r\n\r\nhave  good  learning ability for other subjects,  but  for  some\r\n\r\nreasons  could not cope with the learning of Chinese,  shall  be\r\n\r\nallowed to opt for CL `B'. It is only with the recommendation of\r\n\r\nthe  teachers that they are allowed to take CL `B' in  place  of\r\n\r\nCL.  Otherwise, many ethnic Chinese students will use the excuse\r\n\r\nof having come from English-speaking families to readily give up\r\n\r\nCL and switch to CL `B'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I feel that the contact time should not be reduced for\r\n\r\nthe  learning of Chinese.  I was educated in the Chinese stream.\r\n\r\nDuring my school days, Chinese was the medium of instruction for\r\n\r\nall  the  subjects,  such as history, geography,  science,  etc.\r\n\r\nOnly  EL2  was taught in English.  Consequently, no  matter  how\r\n\r\nmuch  time  I  spent, how much efforts I made to  learn,  I  was\r\n\r\nunable to master my English.  This was because I did not have  a\r\n\r\nreally good environment to be in contact with English\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the situation in Singapore is just the reverse. Other\r\n\r\nthan  the  subject \"Chinese\", the textbooks and the teaching  of\r\n\r\nall the other subjects are in English.  English is the medium of\r\n\r\ninstruction.   In  the  circumstances, with  only  one  subject,\r\n\r\nChinese,  how can you expect the students to master the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage?   It  is  certainly not easy!  More  importantly,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must ensure that the students have enough  time  and\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  learn  Chinese.   Therefore,  I  suggest  that,\r\n\r\nwhether it is Higher Chinese, CL2, or CL `B', the exposure  time\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  reduced.  The teaching periods  should  not  be\r\n\r\nreduced  for  diverting to the other subjects.   If  any  school\r\n\r\nwishes  to reduce the Chinese periods, its principal must  first\r\n\r\nseek  the  approval of the Ministry of Education,  stating  very\r\n\r\nvalid  grounds, before it can be done.  The opportunity to learn\r\n\r\nChinese must not be sacrificed in order for the school to strive\r\n\r\nfor higher ranking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, we must place more emphasis on the economic value of\r\n\r\nChinese language.  Over the past few decades, the Government has\r\n\r\nbeen  doing  a lot for Chinese Language and this is for  all  to\r\n\r\nsee.  We often emphasise that the importance of learning Chinese\r\n\r\nis  in  the preservation of our Chinese culture, Chinese values,\r\n\r\nChinese  tradition  and Chinese heritage.   However,  today,  we\r\n\r\nshould  go one step further to emphasise the economic  value  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  language,  and  the impact  it  may  have  on  the\r\n\r\nindividuals, the society, and the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always feel that during our past 30 years of nation-building,\r\n\r\nif  we did not have English, we would not be able to achieve the\r\n\r\nsort  of  economic development we have today.  Our people  would\r\n\r\nnot be able to enjoy such a high standard of living.  But in the\r\n\r\nnext  30 years, if we do not add in the Chinese language to  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  Language, there will be great obstacles to  our  future\r\n\r\nprosperity and progress.   We may find it very difficult to move\r\n\r\none  step higher in our economic development, and there will not\r\n\r\nbe  good  years, year after year.  This is because  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage will play a very important economic role in the 21st\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncentury.  If our parents and  students  today  only\r\n\r\nrecognise  the  economic  value  of  English,  and  neglect  the\r\n\r\neconomic  value  of  the Chinese language  in  the  Asia-Pacific\r\n\r\nregion,  we  will  be  lagging behind  others  in  the  economic\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore suggest that, apart from emphasising on the\r\n\r\nintrinsic values of the Chinese language in preserving  cultural\r\n\r\nand traditional values, the Government should also emphasise the\r\n\r\neconomic  value and importance of the Chinese language  so  that\r\n\r\nstudents  will be more pro-active in taking a positive  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  the  learning of Chinese, just as the  way  they  learn\r\n\r\ntheir  English,   rather  than taking  a  passive  and  negative\r\n\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, review and re-study the possibility of reviving\r\n\r\nthe Chinese school. Some 20 to 30 years ago, because of the poor\r\n\r\nemployment  prospects  for  the graduates  of  Chinese  schools,\r\n\r\nparents sent their children to English schools, resulting in the\r\n\r\nsurvival  of the Chinese schools being threatened.  The  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools   were   facing  extinction.   Fortunately,   with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's strong defence of the Chinese language to  preserve\r\n\r\nthe  excellent  heritage of the Chinese  culture  and  the  fine\r\n\r\ntraditional values, the Chinese language has been able  to  grow\r\n\r\nsteadily and healthily in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the economic reform and open-door policy of China, the\r\n\r\neconomic  value  of the Chinese language has become  higher  and\r\n\r\nhigher.  Learning better and more Chinese is very  important  to\r\n\r\nthe   future   economic  development  of  Singapore.    In   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  this may be an appropriate time to  re-open  the\r\n\r\ncase   for  us  to  re-study  and  review  the  feasibility   of\r\n\r\nestablishing one or two Chinese schools in Singapore.  For those\r\n\r\nwho  excel in Chinese Language, they can concentrate on majoring\r\n\r\ntheir CL1, with  EL2 being offered as an optional subject.  This\r\n\r\nis  to deal with the changes in the economic development of  the\r\n\r\nAsia-Pacific region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, if I were to make this suggestion, I would be\r\n\r\naccused  of  turning back the wheel of history or following  the\r\n\r\nbeaten track.  But today, if we can coolly and objectively study\r\n\r\nand  review  this matter, it will be of benefit  to  the  future\r\n\r\neconomic  development  of Singapore.  I  urge  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation to consider this suggestion of mine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the policy statement of the Deputy Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, I would like to join the debate\r\n\r\nto welcome the policy, not as the Members who have spoken before\r\n\r\nme,  as  a  bilingual person, but as, practically, a monolingual\r\n\r\nSingaporean.   I come from a family where for three generations,\r\n\r\nthey  have  spoken English in the home and this has disarmed  me\r\n\r\nfor  bilingualism, especially in Chinese.  But I had, in my  own\r\n\r\nlife  time, come to appreciate Chinese literature in translation\r\n\r\nas  well as to feel, over the last years, a certain disadvantage\r\n\r\nin simply having ordinary discourse and discussions and dealings\r\n\r\nwith  my  fellow  Singaporeans.  So I found  myself  in  America\r\n\r\ntrying  to  learn Chinese because there they start  from  ground\r\n\r\nzero.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I welcome the policy, in the sense that the future will\r\n\r\nbe  better  for  people like me.  Not that  we  will  take  easy\r\n\r\noptions.  Recently, my wife and I have had a child and the  idea\r\n\r\nof  putting  the  child through the rigorous  Chinese  Language,\r\n\r\nwhich  is now required in school, was of great concern to us  as\r\n\r\nwith  all  parents in Singapore.  Coming from a purely  English-speaking  background,  the effort of the child  would  be  quite\r\n\r\ntremendous  as the report suggests sometimes is the case.   More\r\n\r\nthan that, we are concerned that the child will be a drag on his\r\n\r\nfellow  students.   Being  a teacher myself,  we  know  how  the\r\n\r\nslowest  child  sometimes holds back the whole class.   We  have\r\n\r\nalso  come to find from our friends that parents themselves make\r\n\r\nan  effort, in the sense that they too have to relearn the basic\r\n\r\nChinese  to  pass it on to their children.  And after  this,  we\r\n\r\nthought perhaps the only happy person in this whole exercise was\r\n\r\nthe private tutor who would be well employed for many years with\r\n\r\nmy child.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been unintended consequences of a very good bilingual\r\n\r\npolicy.   There  have been concerns that people might  think  of\r\n\r\nmigration  because  of the Chinese Language  requirements.   And\r\n\r\nthere  has been concern that the increasing emphasis on  Chinese\r\n\r\nwould  create  some  unintended divisions  between  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  other  non-Chinese  or  non-Chinese  speaking\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  I think the new policy must  be  welcomed  in\r\n\r\nattending to these unintended consequences.  I think that it  is\r\n\r\ncorrect   also  that  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  has   spoken\r\n\r\nstraightaway of disincentives so that Singaporeans will not  opt\r\n\r\nfor  soft options.  There must be sufficient incentives to study\r\n\r\nChinese  and sufficient disincentives to make sure none give  up\r\n\r\nwithout sufficient effort.  In other words, I am cognisant, as I\r\n\r\nam sure the Deputy Prime Minister is, that this is not the start\r\n\r\nof  a  monolingual Singapore, which I will not welcome.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink  similarly, it should not be too much on the  other  side,\r\n\r\nthat  it cannot be too hard to opt for the CL `B'.  And so, this\r\n\r\nwill  require a fine balance by the Government and the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are two things, if I may suggest. The first is\r\n\r\nthat  in CL `B', the question of cultural content must be looked\r\n\r\nat using English or bilingual text.  The second is that this new\r\n\r\npolicy  may be a good opportunity to reassure Singaporeans  that\r\n\r\nin  the  same school, we can cater to different needs,  that  in\r\n\r\naddition  to  the  SAP schools, which are predominantly  Chinese\r\n\r\npupils  of Chinese-speaking backgrounds, in the same school,  we\r\n\r\ncan  accommodate  many more Singaporeans of  different  language\r\n\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Chinese elite, I, as an English-speaking Singaporean,\r\n\r\nwould  hold  out a reassurance that there are incentives  and  a\r\n\r\ngrowing social importance to speak English, which is why I tried\r\n\r\nto  learn Chinese at my late age.  And similarly, that is why  I\r\n\r\nwould  like my child to learn to speak Chinese.  People want  to\r\n\r\nspeak  Mandarin  and  Chinese.  The  rise  of  China,  which  is\r\n\r\nforetold  by  many  people,  will  not  mean  just  an  economic\r\n\r\nincentive to speak Chinese.  The rise of China will lead to a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrise in soft power, that is power in terms  of  the\r\n\r\npolitics  and  economics will translate to a growing  importance\r\n\r\nattached  to the language, to the culture, and not just  to  the\r\n\r\ntraditional culture, but new popular cultures emerging from East\r\n\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social preference in Singapore for bilingualism and for\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking exists and should continue.  But what I welcome\r\n\r\nin  the  new  policy is a reduction of compulsion.   As  for  my\r\n\r\nlittle  son, I want him, like all good Singaporeans, to  try  to\r\n\r\nsucceed  despite whatever disadvantage my unfortunate upbringing\r\n\r\nhas  given  him.  And, therefore, I welcome the new policy.   We\r\n\r\nwill  reward him for his efforts but I think we will not  punish\r\n\r\nhim  for his background.  We will allow him to try his best  but\r\n\r\nwill  give  him a chance to succeed when he cannot be among  the\r\n\r\nvery best in Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do\r\n\r\nnot   think  that  many  Singaporeans  will  argue  against  the\r\n\r\nbilingual  policy adopted in our current education system.   The\r\n\r\nobjective of such a policy is very clear.  It is necessary for a\r\n\r\nmultiracial  society  to  possess a common  language  that  will\r\n\r\nbridge  cultural differences and ensure a mode of  communication\r\n\r\nbetween  ourselves and the rest of the world.  Yet, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  our roots and Asian heritage should not be sacrificed  in\r\n\r\nlieu of this practical necessity.  But while we are very certain\r\n\r\nthat  our  objective  and  goal  is  to  achieve  an  acceptable\r\n\r\nbilingual  ability  in all our students, the  implementation  of\r\n\r\nthis goal and objective may not be as straightforward a task  as\r\n\r\none  may  assume.  In fact, it has proven to be the most complex\r\n\r\nand difficult task for the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everchanging circumstances in this world call for a dynamic\r\n\r\nand  fluid  education  system which our population  can  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom.   Language has always been a very emotive issue to  tackle\r\n\r\nin  a  multiracial  society like ours.  I  must  compliment  the\r\n\r\nMinistry for its tenacity and single-mindedness in pursuing  the\r\n\r\nbest solution towards the attainment of our national objectives.\r\n\r\nBut such is the immense nature of this mammoth task\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat the results of its effort may  sometimes  turn\r\n\r\nout to be less than perfect.  What is comforting to note is that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  has not been afraid of changing course  when  the\r\n\r\nsituation has called for it.  The change that is being  proposed\r\n\r\nby  the  DPM's Ministerial Statement is therefore another effort\r\n\r\nin  fine-tuning the existing bilingual system in order that some\r\n\r\nof the problems can be addressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It recognises that not all students can be proficient in\r\n\r\ntwo   languages  and  these  include  even  some  of  the   more\r\n\r\nacademically above average students.  The proposal  to  increase\r\n\r\nthe percentage of students in taking up Higher Chinese should be\r\n\r\nwelcomed  as  it  offers more opportunities to  those  who  have\r\n\r\nproven to be competent and have the inclination and interest  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  the  challenge  of learning the  Chinese  Language  in\r\n\r\ngreater depth.  Here, I do not want to elaborate on the benefits\r\n\r\nfrom being able to study Chinese at a higher level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of CL `B' to those less endowed with this\r\n\r\nspecial skill will  enable them to have at least the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  acquire a certain working knowledge of the language  without\r\n\r\nbeing  pressurised, to study something which they  perceive  for\r\n\r\nwhatever reasons they are incapable of.  This would ensure  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  concentrate their best effort on  other  subjects  of\r\n\r\ntheir choice.  This basic working knowledge will also be able to\r\n\r\nprovide them a foundation that will allow them to improve  their\r\n\r\nproficiency  in  the  language at a later stage  in  their  life\r\n\r\nshould a need arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point of time, I would like to share a personal\r\n\r\nexperience  regarding the study of Chinese Language.   My  son's\r\n\r\nacademic  achievement in school had been quite  good,  but,  for\r\n\r\nsome  inexplicable reason, he developed a mental  block  towards\r\n\r\nthe  learning of Chinese.  I do not think it is because  of  his\r\n\r\nfamily  background because both my wife and I are more  or  less\r\n\r\neffectively  bilingual  and  our daughter  has  managed  to  get\r\n\r\nthrough  the `O' level Chinese without much problem.  But  after\r\n\r\nmuch effort and frustration, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntried  to  remove this mental  block.   With  great\r\n\r\nregret, we had to advise him to drop the subject during the  `O'\r\n\r\nlevel  examination in order that he could concentrate  on  other\r\n\r\nsubjects as it was obvious that in no way he could obtain a pass\r\n\r\nin  Chinese  in  the  `O' level at that time  when  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nsyllabus was quite heavy, the teaching method very rigid and the\r\n\r\nexamination process uncompromising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the greater consideration was that we had to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  he  would  not be unduly pressurised into doing  something\r\n\r\nthat  would have an adverse effect on the progress of his  other\r\n\r\nsubjects.  It has proven to be the right decision as after being\r\n\r\nreleased  of  the  unnecessary pressure, he  managed  to  obtain\r\n\r\nfairly  good  results in all his other subjects.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the lack of a pass in Chinese, he was unable  to  be\r\n\r\nadmitted  to a junior college.  Until today, he still carries  a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount  of bitterness in him and an anger  towards  us.\r\n\r\nBecause at that time, he just could not accept the unfairness of\r\n\r\nit all that some of his classmates were admitted into JC with 15\r\n\r\nor 16 points, whereas a 8 pointer like him was refused admission\r\n\r\nand deprived of his chance of going into a local university, all\r\n\r\nbecause he could not master a subject which he considers  of  no\r\n\r\napparent relevance to his future career.  I must say that he was\r\n\r\nlucky  because  we were in a position to send  him  overseas  to\r\n\r\ncomplete   his  higher  education.   He  is  now   a   qualified\r\n\r\nprofessional with a Masters degree in architecture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder how many less fortunate bright students have\r\n\r\nmissed out the opportunity to further their education because of\r\n\r\nthis.  However, the twist of the whole story is that now my  son\r\n\r\nhas  to  go to China to do business.  How he had wished that  he\r\n\r\nhas  at  least  some basic working knowledge to  build  upon  in\r\n\r\nacquiring   a   higher   proficiency  in  the   very   important\r\n\r\ncommunication  tool  in order to help him in  dealing  with  his\r\n\r\ncounterparts  in China.  I am sure now he has a torrid  time  to\r\n\r\nmake  himself  understood or to understand his  counterparts  in\r\n\r\nChina  when he is over there doing business.  I suppose  now  he\r\n\r\nwill have to find a way to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nre-immerse himself into the task of  studying  this\r\n\r\nvery complex language.  How?  I do not know.  Therefore, I think\r\n\r\nthe  latest move by the Ministry will definitely improve greatly\r\n\r\nthe  chance of us achieving our national objective, and  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  ensuring  maximum opportunity  in  giving  to  each\r\n\r\nstudent to exploit his potential to the fullest according to his\r\n\r\nability and pace of learning the Chinese language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by sounding a word of caution.\r\n\r\nOne  can  have  a  perfectly correct policy  and  a  very  clear\r\n\r\nobjective  and  even a well worked out system  in  reaching  our\r\n\r\ngoal,  but  without the correct implementation programme  and  a\r\n\r\nteam of highly efficient teachers to carry out the task, all the\r\n\r\neffort  and  time  spent  in drawing up the  blueprint  will  be\r\n\r\nwasted.   The teaching of Chinese, more than any other  subject,\r\n\r\nneeds  creativity and flexibility.  How to sustain the  interest\r\n\r\nin  learning  this  very  complex and  difficult  subject  is  a\r\n\r\nchallenge  in  the  Education administration  and  the  teaching\r\n\r\nprofession.  I hope that with the latest improvements  made,  it\r\n\r\nwill  bring us nearer to our goal of achieving a truly bilingual\r\n\r\neducation system that can carry us towards the next millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   every  time  when  we  talk  about  the  language  issue,\r\n\r\nparticularly the Chinese language, people will say it is a  very\r\n\r\nsensitive issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever we talk about revising the curriculum for the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  Chinese, the Chinese-educated would say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is going to lower the standard of Chinese  again.  As\r\n\r\nfor  the English-educated parents, their concern is whether  the\r\n\r\nstandard of Chinese is too high for their children to pass.  But\r\n\r\nafter  some  20  years of fine-tuning, some 80% to  90%  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents  seem to be quite comfortable with the present standard\r\n\r\nof the Chinese language in our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Dr Ow mentioned that in Chinese, we learn to\r\n\r\ntalk,  listen, write and read.  But there are many  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  never  studied  Chinese  in school.   They  may  not  speak\r\n\r\nMandarin well, but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  can  certainly sing well  in  Chinese  during\r\n\r\nkaraoke  sessions!  Our MP for Potong Pasir, Mr Chiam  See  Tong\r\n\r\nwho  is a typical English-educated, may not speak Mandrain well,\r\n\r\nbut  we all know that he sings the famous Chinese song, Rong Shu\r\n\r\nXia  (Under the Banyan Tree) very well and raised a lot of funds\r\n\r\nin the process.  To sing this song well, you need not only a lot\r\n\r\nof  stamina  but  also a good understanding of  the  lyrics  (in\r\n\r\nChinese)  in  order that you may express your feelings  in  your\r\n\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on the whole, we have catered to the needs of the\r\n\r\nmajority  of Singaporeans.  Perhaps many Singaporeans are  still\r\n\r\nhaving  difficulties  learning  Chinese  and  do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nnecessary breakthrough in their mentality.  So this announcement\r\n\r\nby DPM is very timely.  In other words, it will not only be able\r\n\r\nto cater for the majority of Singaporeans, but in fact, everyone\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  Yet, many people are still worried that under the\r\n\r\nnew  policy  CL  `B' may result in the standard of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage  being  lowered once again. On  the  other  hand,  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are worried because more and more  youngsters  are\r\n\r\nspeaking  Mandarin. You hear people speaking Mandarin everywhere\r\n\r\n-  in  the  buses,  in  shopping  complexes,  and  even  in  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  campus.  They fear that the standard of English  may\r\n\r\nbe lowered.  This is characteristic of our Singapore society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look around the other countries, lowering of the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  languages is a universal problem.  In  China,  the\r\n\r\nparents  are  complaining that their children are  not  learning\r\n\r\nChinese  well enough, while the English people are worried  that\r\n\r\ntheir  children do not speak good English.  This  is  a  general\r\n\r\ntrend.  When we go into the 21st century, what is the  challenge\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore?  We want to compete in the market.  We  want  to\r\n\r\ncompete for talents.  We want to attract foreign talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, a few Members have spoken about the emergence of\r\n\r\nChina  as  a  new economic power.  The situations all  over  the\r\n\r\nworld  are  different.  We want to develop a  Chinese  elite,  a\r\n\r\nMalay  elite, a Tamil elite.  We want talents. Whether they  are\r\n\r\nthe  elites in the field of language or in the field of  science\r\n\r\nand technology, we want these talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee mentioned that we are going to have one\r\n\r\nmore SAP school.  Is it a good thing or a bad thing?  I think it\r\n\r\nis  a  good  thing,  in  terms  of  quantity  and   geographical\r\n\r\ndistribution.  We feel that the SAP school is a pillar  for  the\r\n\r\nChinese  community.  I think we should not allow this pillar  to\r\n\r\nlose  its  significance.  Just now, DPM has said that  some  SAP\r\n\r\nschools  are not doing well academically.  This is a  matter  of\r\n\r\ngreat concern to the Chinese community.  For those schools which\r\n\r\nare  not doing well, they should ask the Board of Governors  and\r\n\r\ntheir  Old  Boys Association to find some ways to bring  up  the\r\n\r\nstandard,  and  ranking, of these schools, so that  the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity will not feel that they are losing this pillar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, within the last two to three decades, we\r\n\r\nhave  already evolved into a bilingual society.  This is a  good\r\n\r\nthing  because  in  such an environment, we  would  be  able  to\r\n\r\ndevelop multi-lingualism.  I think Singaporeans should help  our\r\n\r\nfellow  Singaporeans.  We should support fellow Singaporeans  so\r\n\r\nthat everyone would be able to develop our own potentials.   For\r\n\r\nthose who may be weak in the language, we should find some  ways\r\n\r\nto  help  them  clear  their obstacles,  so  that  their  future\r\n\r\ndevelopment will not be hampered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the policy statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe mother tongue language policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the Singapore students have done very well.\r\n\r\nThe  more able ones who are good in Chinese should be encouraged\r\n\r\nto   do   Chinese.  In  other  words,  they  should   be   given\r\n\r\nopportunities to study Higher Chinese at our SAP schools and  at\r\n\r\njunior  college,  these students should  be  enrolled  into  the\r\n\r\nLanguage Elective Programme.  They will then be able to continue\r\n\r\nto   teach   and  promote  our  Chinese  language  and  culture.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  they  should be able to conduct businesses  in  China\r\n\r\nwith a knowledge of Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened to Dr Ow Chin Hock and I think Mr Peh Chin\r\n\r\nHua and also DPM and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  words \"Chinese elite\" kept  cropping  up.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  should  avoid labelling such group as  Chinese  elite\r\n\r\ngroup.  Being proficient in Chinese do not qualify them as elite\r\n\r\nChinese.  What do we call those Singaporeans later on who do  CL\r\n\r\n`B'?   For  that matter, what type of Chinese  am  I?   I  am  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  born  Chinese, educated in English, I speak  Hokkien,\r\n\r\nMalay  and  a  few words of Mandarin.  I do not belong  to  this\r\n\r\nelitist  group.  So what type of Chinese am I?  I  therefore  am\r\n\r\nnot comfortable with the words \"Chinese elite\".  I think it is a\r\n\r\nvery  divisive term and we should in fact do away with this term\r\n\r\nand  just  continue with what we intend to do, that is,  to  get\r\n\r\nable Chinese students to do Higher Chinese so that we can have a\r\n\r\ngroup  of good Chinese educated Singaporeans to help us to teach\r\n\r\nour  next generation of Chinese better and also to encourage our\r\n\r\nSingaporean Chinese who have to do business in China to do well.\r\n\r\nI  think  that should be it.  I do not think we should use  such\r\n\r\nwords  like  \"elitist\"  But when we make this  call  to  improve\r\n\r\nChinese  teaching among our Chinese, I think we should  also  be\r\n\r\naware that in a multi-racial country like Singapore, we must not\r\n\r\ngive  the  non-Chinese the impression that we are  doing  it  at\r\n\r\ntheir expense.  Therefore, I agree with DPM that those Malay and\r\n\r\nTamil   students  who  do  well  should  also  be  given   equal\r\n\r\nopportunities to pursue their course of study in Tamil or Malay.\r\n\r\nIf  there should be sufficient numbers, like DPM said, we should\r\n\r\nactually form a class to take them in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Singaporean English-educated Chinese whose\r\n\r\nchildren are not very good in Chinese, I welcome the DPM's  call\r\n\r\nthat  we should have another syllabus, CL `B'.  But I also agree\r\n\r\nwith  some  of the Members who have called for caution  that  we\r\n\r\nmust  not  allow  these English-educated Chinese  to  let  their\r\n\r\nchildren  do  this  softer option of CL  `B'.   As  an  English-educated   Chinese,  I  realise  that  I  am   at   a   terrible\r\n\r\ndisadvantage.  If I had not known Hokkien, I do not think I  can\r\n\r\nharness the number of votes in Ayer Rajah.  But that also is not\r\n\r\na   consolation.    I   would  really  encourage   Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  English-educated Singaporeans, to  continue  to\r\n\r\nstrive hard to ask\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir children to do Mandarin well.  Mr Simon Tay is\r\n\r\nan  English-educated Chinese and, he, like me,  would  want  our\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to continue to do Chinese as well as their English.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the\r\n\r\nDPM's  timely announcement on the change of the teaching of  the\r\n\r\nsecond language in our schools.  I support the proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been nearly 20 years since this House last\r\n\r\nconsidered  any  major policy announcement  which  affected  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  the second language in our schools.  If  you  will\r\n\r\nrecall Sir, the then Education Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee and his\r\n\r\nteam of systems engineers went about reviewing our strategies to\r\n\r\nstreamline our efforts to bring about an efficient and effective\r\n\r\neducation policy for the country.  While the Goh Report  brought\r\n\r\nabout  many  changes, the one major impact  which  left  a  deep\r\n\r\nimpression in our schools relates to streaming and the  teaching\r\n\r\nof  the  second  language.  The report had laid  the  foundation\r\n\r\ntoday  for the teaching of the second language at the two levels\r\n\r\nas we know it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underlying the report is the assumption that students must\r\n\r\nknow their mother tongue to preserve their cultural roots.   The\r\n\r\nfear, as I understand then, was that we did not want our society\r\n\r\nto become a loose limb calypso society speaking a pidgin form of\r\n\r\nChinese,  Tamil or Malay and without any real cultural  link  to\r\n\r\nthe  countries of origin.  Certainly, we did not want  to  be  a\r\n\r\nWest  Indies  of the East.  However, because we appreciated  the\r\n\r\ndifferent learning abilities of our students, we allowed them to\r\n\r\nlearn  the  second  language according to  their  ability.   The\r\n\r\nobjective  then  was to let the children know  enough  of  their\r\n\r\nsecond  language so that they should be able to read a newspaper\r\n\r\npublished  in  the  second language.   Indeed,  the  object  was\r\n\r\nambitious, to say the least.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years on, and I am glad to note that the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  announced that the Government intends to change some of the\r\n\r\nexisting  policies  relating  to  the  teaching  of  the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage.  After\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n20 years, I would say that the review is timely  as\r\n\r\nwe  would have had sufficient experience from our implementation\r\n\r\nof the second language policy to fine tune its application.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How have we fared thus far? Overall, I believe that had we\r\n\r\nnot  embarked on the policy of learning the second  language,  a\r\n\r\nwhole  generation  of  school  children  would  have  lost   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  imbibe the inherent cultural values  that  came\r\n\r\nwith  the mother tongue.  Indeed, it is my observation  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  been so successful at the teaching of the second  language\r\n\r\nthat  in the case of Chinese we have wide acceptance and use  of\r\n\r\nthe  second language among Singaporeans today.  In fact, we find\r\n\r\nmore students using Mandarin as the lingua franca in schools and\r\n\r\nin  the universities.  Even in schools which traditionally  used\r\n\r\nEnglish  as the spoken language, Mandarin is increasingly  being\r\n\r\nspoken  freely.  Among the HDB heartlanders, Mandarin  is  often\r\n\r\nused as a main language of communication.  I know because when I\r\n\r\ngo  on  my  house  visits,  I  find  myself  using  Mandarin  to\r\n\r\ncommunicate with my residents more than I use English.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we may have achieved some degree of success in\r\n\r\ngetting  the second language across to the students, we have  to\r\n\r\nask  ourselves, as indeed we are now asking ourselves, the price\r\n\r\nwhich  we have to pay in order to get there.  For many students,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  whose parents speak  Mandarin  at  home,  the\r\n\r\nlearning of the second language does not appear to be a problem.\r\n\r\nYou see, exposure to a bilingual education is not evenly placed.\r\n\r\nThe  student has, in the case of one who comes from a  Mandarin-speaking  background,  every  opportunity  to  learn  a   second\r\n\r\nlanguage  at  home and to brush up his English in  school.   For\r\n\r\nthis  child, learning Chinese, as our DPM has said, is merely  a\r\n\r\nmatter of formalising what he already learns at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, a child coming from an English-speaking\r\n\r\nenvironment  suffers  the  distinct  disadvantage  of   treating\r\n\r\nChinese  as  a  new  language, a language  that  is  perhaps  no\r\n\r\ndifferent than if you were to take up Tamil or Thai. To him, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChinese language may be a totally new language  and\r\n\r\nhis  exposure to the language may be confined to just  what  has\r\n\r\nbeen  taught  in  the  classroom.   Unless  the  child  has  the\r\n\r\ndiscipline  and  makes  a  conscious effort  to  retain  and  to\r\n\r\npractise  the language in order to master it, and I  can  assure\r\n\r\nyou,  Sir, for a hyperactive 10-year old is almost an impossible\r\n\r\nundertaking, he will not be able to master Chinese  as  well  as\r\n\r\nhis  classmates from a Mandarin-speaking environment is able  to\r\n\r\nmaster  his English.  In other words, the child from an English-speaking  environment  operates under a real  handicap  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to learning of the Chinese language.  This is not  helped\r\n\r\nby  the  fact  that  the Chinese language is  one  of  the  most\r\n\r\ndifficult  languages to master. After all, the Chinese  ideogram\r\n\r\nrequires  more rote learning than romanised languages, like  the\r\n\r\nEnglish language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore, as it is, is already a very competitive\r\n\r\nsociety.   Our  values reflect the virtues  of  meritocracy  and\r\n\r\nequality.   Education  has  long  since  been  recognised  as  a\r\n\r\nprincipal  means  by  which  social  mobility  and  success   is\r\n\r\nattained.   For  many Singaporeans, being a parent  of  a  child\r\n\r\nwinning a President's scholarship and succeeding through his own\r\n\r\nsheer effort and talent afterwards in life is a natural thing to\r\n\r\nwish  for.   Because of the emphasis on excellence in education,\r\n\r\nschooling becomes an extremely competitive undertaking for  most\r\n\r\nstudents and parents.  Many parents will be anxious to put their\r\n\r\nchildren  nearer  the  top  of  education  success,  and   would\r\n\r\nlogically not spare any effort to ensure that their children  do\r\n\r\nnot  suffer from any disadvantage.  This includes ensuring  that\r\n\r\nthe relative disadvantage that comes from learning Chinese as  a\r\n\r\nsecond  language  is  overcome. This may  be  attempted  through\r\n\r\ntuition and remedial classes in Chinese.  For many, this may  be\r\n\r\na desperate act as the small difference in marks can well mean a\r\n\r\ngreat difference in ranking in class and in school.  Such is the\r\n\r\nextent of the competition in our schools today.  This concern is\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  helped by the fact that Chinese and  English  as\r\n\r\nlanguage subjects\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncarry the same weightage. So for a child struggling\r\n\r\nwith  his  Chinese, attaining a mere pass for his Chinese,  will\r\n\r\ninevitably pull down his overall average marks, even  if  he  is\r\n\r\ngood  in  his other subjects.  I am told that this is  the  case\r\n\r\nwith  many  ACS boys.   The sad truth is that these boys,  while\r\n\r\nthey  may  have  done  well in the other  subjects,  have  their\r\n\r\noverall  average  marks  pulled  down  because  of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage.    As   a  result,  they  do  not  qualify   for   ACS\r\n\r\n(Independent) which is widely seen as a better school  but  have\r\n\r\nto settle for ACS at Barker Road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many students know this and in order that they do not\r\n\r\nsuffer  from  the  fate of a lower average because  of  Chinese,\r\n\r\nparents  and students invariably spend an inordinate  amount  of\r\n\r\ntime  learning the language, and often times at the  expense  of\r\n\r\nthe  other  more useful and fruitful pursuits.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nthe  students  do  not  have a life as a result;  and  for  many\r\n\r\nparents, this is an additional contribution to stressful  living\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis on the second language also means that\r\n\r\nstudents may have less time for the other subjects, particularly\r\n\r\nthe English language.  Sir,  I have heard many times the comment\r\n\r\nthat the quality of the written and spoken English among younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  today  has dropped.  In  fact,  in  terms  of  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  command of the language, the younger Singaporeans  on\r\n\r\naverage  do not seem to have as adequate a grasp of the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage  as  those  who  had gone to school  perhaps  10  years\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to learn our mother tongue in order that we can\r\n\r\npreserve our roots and our values.  As it is, our present policy\r\n\r\nis  fundamentally sound.  Requiring our students  to  learn  the\r\n\r\nmother   tongue  has  the  effect  of  achieving  our  principal\r\n\r\nobjectives.   The effort that some of our children  have  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  seems tremendous.  One might ask whether a sledgehammer\r\n\r\nhas  been  employed to kill an ant.  It is right that we  should\r\n\r\nnow  stand  back  and ask ourselves whether this  policy  should\r\n\r\nstand and whether it should not be refined further.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reviewing the teaching of our second\r\n\r\nlanguage  and our language policy, in particular, we should  ask\r\n\r\nourselves the basic question of what we want our society  to  be\r\n\r\nin the next millennium.  I think we have to accept the fact that\r\n\r\nwe  can  never replicate, in the case of the teaching of Chinese\r\n\r\nas  a  second  language, the full extent of Chinese civilisation\r\n\r\nand culture in Singapore for posterity, and should we?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an independent country. Our people may have come\r\n\r\nfrom  many  lands.    Whether  we  are  here  by  choice  or  by\r\n\r\ncircumstance, we have to decide on our own common  destiny.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to  build  a  multi-racial nation  that  is  uniquely  and\r\n\r\ndistinctly  Singapore.  While we may each  retain  our  distinct\r\n\r\nethnic  grouping,  there is an overarching need  to  subordinate\r\n\r\nthis  to  the  higher  need of forging common  bonds  among  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  races,  which transcend ethnic  ties.   Our  language\r\n\r\npolicy must therefore serve that purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our case, we need to understand that our cultural values\r\n\r\nare  evolving all the time.  As a fourth generation  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  am proud of my Chinese heritage and  culture.   I\r\n\r\nwent  to  an  English  school and learnt  Chinese  as  a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage, although I cannot say I am very good at it.  Yet, as a\r\n\r\nfourth generation Chinese in Singapore, I cannot say that  I  am\r\n\r\nas  much a Chinese as my fellow Chinese in China, Taiwan or Hong\r\n\r\nKong  are.  I am not sure whether I want to be.  While  we  make\r\n\r\nevery  effort  to  preserve our heritage with our  children,  we\r\n\r\ncannot fight against the tide of change, especially when we  are\r\n\r\ncut  off  from our roots.  I wonder sometimes whether  practices\r\n\r\nlike  the mid-Autumn festival, wherein we tell our children that\r\n\r\nin  China  this  is  a time when the harvest is  gathered,  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to have the same significance for us three generations\r\n\r\nor four generations down the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language must serve the purpose of nation building. There\r\n\r\nare  inherent values which we should seek to promote  that  will\r\n\r\npreserve  our  East  Asian  way of  life.   These  include,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  our  communitarian values, respect for authority  and\r\n\r\ncare and concern for the family.  These values may\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe distilled from the language and be  imparted  to\r\n\r\nour  children.  Through the teaching of the second  language  in\r\n\r\nour schools, these values are reinforced and in the process help\r\n\r\nto promote our nation building efforts.  Therefore, not just the\r\n\r\ncase of the teaching of the Chinese language alone, the teaching\r\n\r\nof  the  other  mother tongues such as Malay and  Tamil  in  our\r\n\r\nschools should work towards the goal of building and reinforcing\r\n\r\nour common national values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we should preserve our Chinese values and roots for its\r\n\r\nown  sake,  we  may  run  into the danger  of  raising  language\r\n\r\nchauvinists.   This  will  not  be  in  our  national  interest.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in  looking  at the issue of  the  teaching  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese language, we should look at it from the context and  the\r\n\r\npurpose  which it intends to serve.  We should accept the  basic\r\n\r\nproposition  that our second language should seek  to  reinforce\r\n\r\nour  nation building efforts and incidental to that, to preserve\r\n\r\nour  cultural heritage while recognising that our heritage  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to evolve in a way that makes it uniquely Singaporean.\r\n\r\nFor  this  reason, the changes to our policy on the teaching  of\r\n\r\nChinese as a second language is welcome and I support it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But before that, I beg your indulgence\r\n\r\nto  say: (In Mandarin) Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you very much  for\r\n\r\nallowing me to use Malay to speak here today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is definitely not CL3 in pronunciation. But I hope you\r\n\r\nunderstand the spirit behind that introduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay) To those who do not understand Mandarin, what I have\r\n\r\nsaid  just  now  is \"Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing  me  to\r\n\r\nspeak in the Malay Language\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the uniqueness of a multi-lingual, multi-racial and\r\n\r\nmulti-religious Singapore.  Unfortunately, I could not speak the\r\n\r\nTamil Language, another official language of Singapore, but  the\r\n\r\nconcern  that  I want to highlight now is also relevant  to  the\r\n\r\nIndian  community here.  However, allow me to say \"Wannakam\"  to\r\n\r\ncomplete the spirit of our multi-lingual Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak not on the aspect of the\r\n\r\ndetails of the policy that was put forward by DPM BG Lee but  on\r\n\r\nthe spirit behind that policy, especially in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe context of the concept of multi-racialism in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, when the Speak Mandarin Campaign was hotly talked\r\n\r\nabout,  I  had the opportunity of attending a forum (in English)\r\n\r\nabout multi-racialism in Singapore.  On that occasion, a Chinese\r\n\r\nactivist  asked  me why was the Malay community concerned  about\r\n\r\nthe  Speak  Mandarin  Campaign.  It is not my  purpose  here  to\r\n\r\ncomment  about the question of the Mandarin Campaign,  but  what\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese leader told me is most interesting.  He said  those\r\n\r\nfrom  the Chinese stream supported the efforts of the Malays  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  use of the Malay language, and the  Malays  should\r\n\r\nalso not harbour any suspicion about the Mandarin Campaign.   He\r\n\r\nfurther added that those who were from the Chinese stream are in\r\n\r\nthe  same  predicament  as the Malay community,  especially  the\r\n\r\nMalay-educated.  We are both minorities in Singapore,  he  said.\r\n\r\nHe  supports the campaign to promote the Malay language and  the\r\n\r\nMalays should also support the Speak Mandarin campaign, he said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Speak Mandarin Campaign for the Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity.  In fact, for me, if there were Malays who can  speak\r\n\r\nMandarin fluently, it is an advantage -- an asset for them.  But  I\r\n\r\nam  confident that it will be done without that Malay man losing\r\n\r\nhis  mother  tongue  and his identity, ie, the  Malay  language.\r\n\r\nObviously,  my  support is not because I am defending  what  was\r\n\r\nsaid as the fate of these two minority groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look around in this region, the majority-minority\r\n\r\nsituation is actually subjective.  The Chinese community is  the\r\n\r\nmajority  in Singapore, but they are a minority in this  region.\r\n\r\nThe  Malay community, on the other hand, is a minority group  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, but they are a majority in this region. Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nif  we  look at  Singapore in the context of Southeast Asia  and\r\n\r\nEast Asia, the Chinese are a big majority if China is taken into\r\n\r\naccount. \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important, Mr Speaker, is that we should see this aspect\r\n\r\nof learning of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlanguage according to the needs of  Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nshould have an open mind and be pragmatic.  In understanding the\r\n\r\napproach  needed for our language policy, whether in  school  or\r\n\r\ngenerally,  avoid  sentiments. For example, although  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity is concerned about the erosion of the command  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay  language among the younger generation and Malay students,\r\n\r\nit  did  not  get  the Malays worked on the sentiments  of   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  language.  The  Malay  community  understands  the\r\n\r\nimportance of English for the students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Malay community had taken the initiative to ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  restrict the registration of Malay  students  in\r\n\r\nschools  up  to  a maximum of 25%, in order to allow  the  Malay\r\n\r\nstudents  to  mix with students from other communities  so  that\r\n\r\nthey can improve their command of the English Language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the issue of SAP schools was debated, the concern of the\r\n\r\nMalay  community  was not to arouse the sentiment  of  awry  but\r\n\r\nrather  the  anxiety as to whether the students in  SAP  schools\r\n\r\nwill  be  conscious of the concept of multi-racialism,  if  they\r\n\r\nwere to be cut-off from the mainstream of the ordinary schools.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  number of PSLE students who were allowed to take  ML1\r\n\r\nwas  limited to 10% of the best, the Malay community  and  their\r\n\r\nleaders  appealed  for  this figure to be  increased.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  community felt that the home environment  and  the\r\n\r\nease that the Malays have with the Malay language will help more\r\n\r\nMalays to master ML1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOE, though concerned about the effect of this change on the\r\n\r\noverall performance of the students, had moderated the policy on\r\n\r\na case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of language education and its deciding factors are\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily the same for all the communities in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf  it was felt that the Malay community had better home support\r\n\r\nthan  the Chinese or Tamil community with regard to their mother\r\n\r\ntongue,  the situation has also begun to change.  Now there  are\r\n\r\nmore Malay families using English at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that, Mr Speaker, I value the Government's decision to\r\n\r\nrevise the question of language for all the languages from  time\r\n\r\nto  time and to make changes, when necessary.  Besides,  I  also\r\n\r\nhope  that the review made for the learning of Mandarin and  the\r\n\r\nancillary changes of entry policy for admitting students  to  JC\r\n\r\nand  university  will  not place the Malay  and  Tamil  Language\r\n\r\nstudents at a disadvantage.  This also needs to be reviewed from\r\n\r\ntime   to   time.    If  it  was  to  bring  about   inequitable\r\n\r\nconsequences, it would affect the credibility of the  policy  of\r\n\r\nmulti-racialism in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the need for us to facilitate the development of the\r\n\r\ncultural elite for the Chinese community, and similarly for  the\r\n\r\nMalay  and Indian cultural elites.  The important thing is  that\r\n\r\nit  is carried out with the full understanding to strengthen the\r\n\r\nbasis and the pillar of multi-racialism policy in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, in his speech, DPM Lee clearly explained  the\r\n\r\npolicy  on  the teaching of Chinese language in future  and  the\r\n\r\nchanges  involved.   He wants more students to  take  up  Higher\r\n\r\nChinese  and to facilitate that, one more school will  become  a\r\n\r\nSAP  school,  and  another  junior college  will  offer  Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage Elective Programme. At the same time, he is also trying\r\n\r\nto  reduce  the burden on those students who have difficulty  in\r\n\r\nlearning Chinese, by making Chinese lessons more streamlined and\r\n\r\nless  difficult while maintaining the standard.  For  those  who\r\n\r\nare having difficulty coping with CL2, they will be offered a CL\r\n\r\n`B'  course so that they will be able to get through  this  less\r\n\r\ndifficult  paper  and proceed to junior college and  university,\r\n\r\nthat is, if their results in the other subjects are good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these proposals are very timely because basically, it\r\n\r\nmakes  a very important educational objective, that is, to allow\r\n\r\nthe  students to learn according to their ability by giving them\r\n\r\nan  option  to take a lower-level Chinese paper, so  as  not  to\r\n\r\nfrustrate their efforts in the other subjects.  I think this  is\r\n\r\na very correct decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of CL `B' is very timely and wise. At the\r\n\r\nmoment,  some  students may be doing reasonably  well  in  other\r\n\r\nsubjects  but,  for  some reasons, just  cannot  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nlearning of Chinese.  We recognise that the ability to learn the\r\n\r\nmother  tongue language may differ from the aptitude  for  other\r\n\r\nsubjects. We also understand that it is never easy to learn  the\r\n\r\nChinese  language. For that matter, the language environment  is\r\n\r\nvery  important  for the learning of any language.   As  we  all\r\n\r\nknow,  Chinese  language is composed of words or characters  put\r\n\r\ntogether.  Every character is an ideograph.  So we just have  to\r\n\r\nmemorize  them,  character by character.  You have  to  keep  on\r\n\r\nusing  these characters repeatedly so that they become  embedded\r\n\r\nin  your memory. Only then can you master the use of the Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage.    If certain words are not used for a long time,  out\r\n\r\nof  sight  out  of mind, they will soon be forgotten.   When  my\r\n\r\nchildren  were learning Chinese in school, they have  to  revise\r\n\r\nthe  lessons they learnt in Primary 2 when they were in  Primary\r\n\r\n3, and Primary 3 lessons at Primary 4, and so on. If they do not\r\n\r\ndo  this,  they will not be able to build on the word bank  they\r\n\r\nhave  accumulated  in the past years and continue  learning  new\r\n\r\nwords to add on to their vocabulary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this because I came from a Chinese school and I am\r\n\r\nspeaking  from my own personal experience. In 1968, I left River\r\n\r\nValley  High  School and joined the university where  everything\r\n\r\nwas  taught  in  English. After my graduation,  I  worked  in  a\r\n\r\ncompletely English-speaking environment.  In 1988,  I  became  a\r\n\r\nMember  of  Parliament and I had to use Chinese  to  communicate\r\n\r\nwith  my  constituents. I had to speak in Chinese and  write  in\r\n\r\nChinese. It was then that I realised that a lot of Chinese words\r\n\r\nwhich  I  had learnt had been forgotten. When I tried  to  write\r\n\r\nChinese,  out of 10 words, I had forgotten at least  two.   Even\r\n\r\ntoday,  I  am  still using the wrong words or writing  with  the\r\n\r\nwrong strokes. I think those of us here who have learned Chinese\r\n\r\nas the first language will also have this similar experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nStudents in Singapore come from various language-speaking  backgrounds. For those whose parents  speak  Mandarin,\r\n\r\nlive in a Mandarin-speaking neighbourhood watching Channel 8 and\r\n\r\nlistening  to  radio programmes on FM95.8, they have  a  perfect\r\n\r\nMandarin-speaking environment. To these students,  speaking  and\r\n\r\nlistening  to  Mandarin is of no problem.  If you want  to  talk\r\n\r\nabout  the standard and level they would have attained, I  think\r\n\r\nthey  should  have  attained  the  CL1  level.   To  them,   the\r\n\r\nenvironment is conducive to their learning of Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, with more and more young parents speaking\r\n\r\nEnglish  at  home,  the  language spoken at  home  is  naturally\r\n\r\nEnglish. They speak English in school, and when they go out with\r\n\r\nfriends, their friends would be speaking to them in English too.\r\n\r\nWhen they turn on the TV, it is Channel 5 that they go for.   On\r\n\r\nradio,  it  is 95.0 - English channels too!  To these  students,\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to speak Mandarin or use Chinese is very  rare.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, they do not have the right environment to learn\r\n\r\nMandarin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the survey report, some 10 years ago, among the\r\n\r\nPrimary  1 students, only 20% of their parents spoke English  at\r\n\r\nhome.   Right  now, 10 years later, the number is 40%.   It  has\r\n\r\ndoubled.   The  family  language  background  in  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nchanged.   More  and more children are coming from  non-Mandarin\r\n\r\nspeaking  family  background.  In fact,  it  has  doubled  in  a\r\n\r\ndecade.   As  I  said,  those  who  come  from  Chinese-speaking\r\n\r\nfamilies will not have much difficulty learning Chinese.  As for\r\n\r\nthose whose family background is not Chinese-speaking, they will\r\n\r\nfind learning Chinese more difficult.  More often than not, they\r\n\r\nhave  to  spend more time on Chinese than on the other subjects,\r\n\r\nand yet the result in CL is not satisfactory. Some even give  up\r\n\r\nChinese completely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of CL `B', these students will have\r\n\r\nan  opportunity to tackle Chinese at a basic level which is more\r\n\r\nattainable  by  them.    They do not have  to  give  up  Chinese\r\n\r\ncompletely and be disqualified for admission to the JCs  or  the\r\n\r\nuniversity.  Some people may say that the number of  such  cases\r\n\r\nis small. But if\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyou look at the statistics, more and more  students\r\n\r\nare coming under this category.  40% of students in a cohort  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  not a small number in absolute terms.  It  is  by  no\r\n\r\nmeans negligible.  So the CL `B' can be said to be targeting  at\r\n\r\nthis  reality, as a practical solution to reduce the  number  of\r\n\r\nstudents opting out of the learning of Chinese.  In other words,\r\n\r\nthe parents of such students will have a mental relief.  They do\r\n\r\nnot  have to worry about their children failing to secure a pass\r\n\r\nin CL2 and a place in the junior college.  So this approach is a\r\n\r\nvery  good solution to cater for the changes in family  language\r\n\r\nbackground in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Chinese as a second language, according to my understanding,\r\n\r\neven  students who have the aptitude to learn CL2 have to  spend\r\n\r\nmore time on the subject than on the other subjects.  If this is\r\n\r\nthe  case, then something must be wrong in the curriculum of the\r\n\r\nCL  subject.   Perhaps,  the standard of  CL2  is   higher  than\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear DPM Lee saying that the level of difficulty of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese textbooks will be reduced.  After revision, the new\r\n\r\ntextbooks  to be published will be less difficult to  learn  and\r\n\r\nunderstand.  I  think  this  is  a  right  thing  to  do.   More\r\n\r\nimportantly, if you look at the present textbooks, we must  take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration the amount of time spent by the students  in\r\n\r\nlearning and understanding them.  I think it is a very important\r\n\r\nfactor.   If the time spent is much more than the time spent  on\r\n\r\nthe  other  subjects,  or out of proportion,  then  we  have  to\r\n\r\nconsider  whether  we should make the new textbooks   easier  to\r\n\r\nunderstand,  so  that the average students will  be  spared  the\r\n\r\nagony of labouring over them\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, it was mentioned to extend the shen guang jiao\r\n\r\ncai (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) textbook currently used by the SEED\r\n\r\nschools  to  other  schools.  On the  question  of  quality  and\r\n\r\nquantity,  they are all very high.  If we were to introduce  the\r\n\r\nshen guang jiao cai (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) or enrichment\r\n\r\nmaterials to the non-SEED schools, or the neighbourhood schools,\r\n\r\nthen  we  are  going  to  run into big problems.  It  will  most\r\n\r\ncertainly increase the burden of the students.  Once the  burden\r\n\r\nis increased,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose who could previously manage  to  just  scrape\r\n\r\nthrough,  will  now find a pass in Chinese beyond  their  reach.\r\n\r\nWe  frequently talk about teaching according to the  ability  of\r\n\r\nthe  students, so these enrichment materials should be used very\r\n\r\nselectively.   Only those who are outstanding in their  learning\r\n\r\nof Chinese shall be asked to take on these enrichment materials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there is a lot of pressure from the Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity on the Ministry of Education to raise the standard  of\r\n\r\nChinese  in  our  schools.  They will be  very  unhappy  if  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education does not or could not do something  about\r\n\r\nit    Among  my  friends, there are quite a number of  graduates\r\n\r\nfrom  the  former Nanyang University or universities in  Taiwan.\r\n\r\nTheir  command  of Chinese is generally stronger  than  that  of\r\n\r\nEnglish.   These people are always very critical of the standard\r\n\r\nof   Chinese  in  Singapore.   They  often  complain  about  bad\r\n\r\npronunciation by the broadcasters, wrong or misused words in the\r\n\r\nChinese  newspapers,  and  students,  undergraduates  and   even\r\n\r\ngraduates  being  unable  to  express  themselves  properly   in\r\n\r\nChinese.  They  often  lament the decline  in  the  standard  of\r\n\r\nChinese in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the level or standard of languages is relative. It\r\n\r\nis  not fair for us to complain that the standard of Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is not as good as the Chinese of China, Taiwan or even\r\n\r\nHong  Kong.   It is not realistic for us to demand that we reach\r\n\r\nthe  same  standard of these people, because  Chinese  is  their\r\n\r\nworking  language.  They speak and write  Chinese  at  home,  in\r\n\r\nschool,  at  work and for every purpose.  This is their  natural\r\n\r\nenvironment.   For us, even if we have a distinction  in  Higher\r\n\r\nChinese,  at  first  language level, LEP or whatever,  we  still\r\n\r\ncannot look at Chinese as our working language.  Whatever it may\r\n\r\nbe, the level of Chinese of those students that we are training,\r\n\r\nthe  so-called Chinese elite, will never be the same as that  of\r\n\r\nChinese students in the Chinese schools of the old days. This is\r\n\r\na  fact,  and  a reality.  Once you understand the reality,  you\r\n\r\nshould not be over critical of our system.  I think it would not\r\n\r\nbe realistic to do so.  I hope the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education can resist  the  pressure  to\r\n\r\nblindly  raise  the  standard  of teaching  of  Chinese  in  our\r\n\r\nschools,  especially in the Language Elective  Programme  (LEP).\r\n\r\nWe  must allow our students to learn at a pace commensurate with\r\n\r\ntheir  individual  ability  to  learn.    Only  those  who   are\r\n\r\ncompetent and have the right aptitude to take on Higher  Chinese\r\n\r\nshall be subjected to a higher standard of Chinese in school.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to speak in strong support of the policies contained in the\r\n\r\nstatement of the Deputy Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak as one who has had very little opportunity during my\r\n\r\nschool  days  in  the distant past of learning  Chinese.   I  do\r\n\r\nremember  my  Chinese teacher.  His primary contract  was  as  a\r\n\r\nphysical education instructor and he was more comfortable in the\r\n\r\nplaying  field  than in the classroom.  His method  of  teaching\r\n\r\nChinese  was to get us all to learn the names of each  other  in\r\n\r\nwritten Chinese and then he would set an examination in multiple\r\n\r\nchoice.  The questions would have one right answer and the  rest\r\n\r\nhe  would  put down our names so that if we figure out  that  we\r\n\r\nknew  each other's names, we would be able to pass, even  though\r\n\r\nwe did not know what the question actually asked for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up in this second English-speaking environment, I\r\n\r\nwas  never encouraged to take the learning of Chinese seriously.\r\n\r\nIt  was  no  secret that if one were to do well in English,  one\r\n\r\ncould have many more opportunities for success.  Imbuing Chinese\r\n\r\nculture  and  language  was regarded as secondary  and  left  to\r\n\r\ngrandparents entirely in dialect.  I hasten to add  by  the  way\r\n\r\nthat of course the school I was speaking of is not a Singaporean\r\n\r\nschool.   It  is so different these days.  Given the  chance  to\r\n\r\nstudy  Chinese in school, students, including my children,  have\r\n\r\nenjoyed  the  opportunity to study Chinese in a systematic  way.\r\n\r\nThe  study  of  language  opens new  vistas  of  experience  and\r\n\r\nknowledge.  I confess to feeling\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nextremely inadequate, as some of the other MPs  have\r\n\r\nsaid, when I have to read Chinese literature and history through\r\n\r\nEnglish translation, even worse, Chinese poetry translated  into\r\n\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I should like to make my first point, not to Members\r\n\r\nhere  but to all students who have been given a chance to  study\r\n\r\ntheir  mother tongue:  do not treat that as a chore as any other\r\n\r\nsubject.   It  is a golden opportunity to understand  one's  own\r\n\r\nculture,  to participate in it, to live in it.  All  too  often,\r\n\r\nstudents think that they need not do well in the language as  it\r\n\r\ndoes not count.  It may not count for so much in terms of points\r\n\r\nbut  it  does count for a great deal subsequently in life.   Now\r\n\r\nthat  those  who find great difficulty in learning the  language\r\n\r\nhave  been given a chance to still continue to learn it  through\r\n\r\nCL  `B',  I  would  certainly say that  that  should  be  warmly\r\n\r\nwelcomed.  I know parents who have had to send children overseas\r\n\r\nto  study  because  Chinese, as it is taught in  Singapore,  had\r\n\r\nproved  daunting for them.  Now, these parents may be  persuaded\r\n\r\nto  let  their  children take the new course  without  fear.   I\r\n\r\nassume  that  those  Singaporeans whose  students  are  studying\r\n\r\nabroad may also feel more confident and may allow their children\r\n\r\nto return to Singapore to take the less difficult option.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to some issues that I am sure parents may\r\n\r\nwant  to know about and quickly.  First, how much easier is  the\r\n\r\nCL  `B'  option likely to be as compared to, say, CL2?   Second,\r\n\r\nwill all schools offer the CL `B' option?  Third, will there  be\r\n\r\nan  opportunity to upgrade to CL2 if the students  do  extremely\r\n\r\nwell  at  CL `B'?  Fourth, the converse of the third query,  how\r\n\r\nwill the school deal with students who choose CL `B' instead  of\r\n\r\nCL2 deliberately, even though he or she may be able to cope with\r\n\r\nCL2?   For instance, a student might say, \"I can only get a pass\r\n\r\ngrade  in CL2 but I may do very well in CL `B'.  So I prefer  to\r\n\r\ndo  that.\"   Is  this practice acceptable or to be  discouraged?\r\n\r\nHere, another matter of concern is the teaching of CL `B'.   Are\r\n\r\nthe teachers to be specially trained to appreciate that they may\r\n\r\nbe dealing with a class that has difficulties in coping with the\r\n\r\nChinese language?  Will the materials also reflect\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis?  Can the Ministry of Education cope with  the\r\n\r\nadditional demands for language teachers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to say that there may be those who\r\n\r\nfeel  that this CL `B' is a watered-down version of the language\r\n\r\nrequirements  and therefore to be deplored.  I  prefer  to  look\r\n\r\nupon  this  positively and say to those who take  such  a  view:\r\n\r\nconsider  how  many more students would now have the  chance  to\r\n\r\nlearn  and use Chinese.  I would say that the CL `B' is a strong\r\n\r\nplus policy to be warmly welcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  support  the  policy  statement  by  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.   But  on his new proposals, I would like  to  present\r\n\r\nsome of my views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, our bilingual policy. Singapore is a multi-lingual, multi-racial society. The Government has encouraged\r\n\r\nthe  various races to maintain their traditional values  and  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  better  sense  of belonging.  In 1966,  the  Government\r\n\r\nimplemented the bilingual system in our schools.  Everybody must\r\n\r\nstudy  English as the first language, with mother tongue as  the\r\n\r\nsecond  language.  For the Chinese, they have to study CL2,  the\r\n\r\nMalay  would  do ML2, while the Indians do TL2.  This  bilingual\r\n\r\npolicy  has  been implemented for 32 years.  We have  cultivated\r\n\r\nmany bilingual talents, and with good results.  Now every one in\r\n\r\nschool  can  speak  two languages.  This is good  not  only  for\r\n\r\nunderstanding both the western and oriental cultures,  but  also\r\n\r\nfor  better communication with our friends from other countries.\r\n\r\nThis  helps  in our nation building. I feel that the  Government\r\n\r\nshould   enhance  our  bilingual  policy  and  give   a   better\r\n\r\naffirmation  for  the  results that we have  achieved  over  the\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the standards of Chinese language in school.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  statistics of the Ministry of Education,  98%  of\r\n\r\nethnic  Chinese  students did Chinese either as  HCL  or  CL  in\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools, and 95% obtained at least  a  pass  for  it.\r\n\r\nAmong  them,  71%  had  A1  or A2.  In other  words,  among  the\r\n\r\nstudents who did Chinese,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nonly  5% failed to secure at least  a  pass.   This\r\n\r\nresult is encouraging and we would like to thank all our Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage teachers for their efforts which resulted in such  good\r\n\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday was Hari Raya Aidilfiltri. I visited a Malay\r\n\r\ngrassroots leader's home where I met a group of school teachers,\r\n\r\namong  whom  were a number of Chinese teachers. They  knew  that\r\n\r\nParliament would be discussing a new policy on the teaching  and\r\n\r\nlearning of Chinese, and showed great concern about it.  I had a\r\n\r\ndiscussion   with  them  for  about  half  an  hour.    In   our\r\n\r\nconversation,  I gathered that these teachers had realised  that\r\n\r\nnowadays, with most parents speaking in English, it is not  easy\r\n\r\nfor  them  to  teach their students to speak good Chinese.   The\r\n\r\nstudents  have  to spend double the time to learn the  language,\r\n\r\nand  the  teachers  have to take twice the  amount  of  time  to\r\n\r\nprepare their lessons.  They have not only to teach the language\r\n\r\nbut  also  to  make  sure that the students  would  be  able  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  and  to  put  to use what they  have  learnt.  These\r\n\r\nteachers have been working very hard.  They deserve our respect.\r\n\r\nNow,  because of these 5% of the students who are unable to pass\r\n\r\ntheir CL2, MOE is introducing a new subject, CL `B', so that the\r\n\r\nstudents  could  continue learning Chinese, albeit  at  a  lower\r\n\r\nlevel,  without  fearing that they may not make the  grade,  and\r\n\r\nhence  denied a place in the junior college and the  university.\r\n\r\nIf  MOE's  intention  is  to help these  5%  students  who  have\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in studying Chinese and to help them  so  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  not give up Chinese completely and face elimination  from\r\n\r\nthe mainstream of education, I think it is a good thing.  It  is\r\n\r\na move in the right direction and this is a feasible policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must ensure that those who have the ability to\r\n\r\ncarry  on doing CL or even HCL do not take the easy way  out  by\r\n\r\nopting  for CL `B' in place of CL. This is because, if  they  do\r\n\r\nso,  it will lower our standard of Chinese and will run contrary\r\n\r\nto  our Prime Minister's appeal to nurture our Chinese elite. We\r\n\r\nshould  let  the  Chinese teachers be the assessors  or  form  a\r\n\r\nspecial  committee to decide which students should be downgraded\r\n\r\nto CL `B' and who should remain in CL2.  I also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuggest that in the initial stages, MOE should  take\r\n\r\nthis  5%  as  the target group, because from present statistics,\r\n\r\nonly  5%  could  not pass their CL2. At the same time,  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest that those who do CL `B' and show marked improvement  in\r\n\r\ntheir standard of Chinese, they should be allowed to go back  to\r\n\r\nCL.  In fact, they should be encouraged to do so.  Only then can\r\n\r\nwe  enhance,  or at least maintain, the standard of  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must groom a group of elite Chinese teachers.\r\n\r\nIn  the National Day Rally in 1997, the Prime Minister mentioned\r\n\r\nthat with English being used as the medium of instruction in all\r\n\r\nour schools, there might come a time in, say, 20 years from now,\r\n\r\nwhen we will have no good Chinese scholars to teach Chinese, and\r\n\r\nthis  will  be  a major problem to our preservation  of  Chinese\r\n\r\ntraditional  culture.   We should cultivate  a  group  of  elite\r\n\r\nChinese teachers who would be charged with the responsibility of\r\n\r\nmaintaining  our  Chinese  traditional  culture.   In  order  to\r\n\r\ncultivate a Chinese elite, we must have a group of elite Chinese\r\n\r\nteachers.   If  we want to have good martial art  exponents,  we\r\n\r\nmust  have  good  gungfu  masters. If  you  want  to  have  good\r\n\r\nathletes,  we  need  to have good coaches.   Without  them,  our\r\n\r\nskills will never improve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days, we had the Nanyang University where many\r\n\r\ngood  quality Chinese teachers were trained and they formed  the\r\n\r\ncore  of  Chinese  teachers.  But nowadays, we  do  not  have  a\r\n\r\nNanyang University to cultivate these Chinese teachers.   So  10\r\n\r\nor  20  years down the road, are we able to train up a group  of\r\n\r\nelite  Chinese  teachers  in order to train  up  this  group  of\r\n\r\nChinese elite students?  So this may be the appropriate time for\r\n\r\nus  to  consider opening a Chinese university to cater  for  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of the 21st century.  To learn traditional values and  to\r\n\r\nhave  a sense of belonging, by just taking a Chinese subject  is\r\n\r\nnot  enough.  If we want to learn the Chinese traditional values\r\n\r\nand  sense of belonging, we have to study from all aspects, like\r\n\r\nHistory, Geography, Economics, Literature, Arts so that we can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  a comprehensive view of the Chinese  culture.\r\n\r\nOnly  then  can  we  be able to inculcate in  our  students  the\r\n\r\ntraditional  Chinese  culture, Chinese values  and  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging.   This  is  a critical moment.   I  suggest  that  we\r\n\r\ncultivate  a  group of elite Chinese students who are  not  only\r\n\r\nproficient  in the Chinese language but also good in  the  other\r\n\r\nsubjects,  to  be trained as Chinese language teachers  so  that\r\n\r\nlater  on when they teach Chinese, they can introduce a  variety\r\n\r\nof  subject  matters  relevant to our modern  world  during  the\r\n\r\nChinese lessons.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir,  having listened carefully to the policy statement\r\n\r\nby  DPM  Lee,  I  feel that the proposed policy to  change  some\r\n\r\naspects  of  the teaching of Chinese in Singapore schools  is  a\r\n\r\nvery balanced one.  On the one hand, it tries to strengthen  the\r\n\r\nnurturing of a Chinese elite, by opening one more SAP school and\r\n\r\nby  providing more opportunities for Chinese students to take on\r\n\r\nHigher Chinese (HCL).  On the other hand, it also tries to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the very small minority of students who have difficulties\r\n\r\nin  learning Chinese, even as a second language.  A new  CL  `B'\r\n\r\ncourse  will  be  offered to them.  This  is  a  very  realistic\r\n\r\napproach.  The whole series of new measures can be said to be  a\r\n\r\nflexible and comprehensive approach which is in keeping with the\r\n\r\nprinciple of teaching according to the student's ability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been implementing the bilingual policy for\r\n\r\nsome  30  years.   I  have been working as a journalist  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  newspapers  for more than 20  years.   I  have  on-hand\r\n\r\nexperience in the implementation of this policy, and  also  some\r\n\r\nexperience in the use of computers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human brain is not unlike the computer, which the\r\n\r\nChinese  described as dian nao (electronic brain).  When  I  was\r\n\r\nfirst  asked  to  use the Chinese word-processing  software,  my\r\n\r\ncomputer  was a 386, which was basically meant for  software  in\r\n\r\nthe  English  language only.  At that time the Chinese  software\r\n\r\nwas just still in its infancy stage of development.  Because the\r\n\r\nnature  of our work in the Chinese newspaper office required  us\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nuse Chinese word-processing technology, we were told\r\n\r\nto  install  the  Chinese software into our  English-environment\r\n\r\ncomputers.  Disaster struck. The 386 did not have enough  memory\r\n\r\nand  capability to support the additional Chinese software.  The\r\n\r\ncomputer \"hanged\" all the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes with the human brain. Just like the\r\n\r\n`electronic  brain', the absorption power, retention  power  and\r\n\r\nthe  power to accommodate data and operations differ from person\r\n\r\nto  person.   Some people are born 286s or 386s.  But  some  are\r\n\r\nborn 486s, and the exception ones may be born Pentiums. Some  of\r\n\r\nus may be able to say, \"I am proficient in one language and have\r\n\r\nsome  working  knowledge of another language.   But  nobody  can\r\n\r\ntruthfully swear that he or she is perfectly bilingual.  No  one\r\n\r\ndares  to  lay claim to that. This is because we are constrained\r\n\r\nby our endowed capability, our learning capacity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum capacity of the hardware of a computer is\r\n\r\nfinite   and   fixed,  while  its  software  may  have   certain\r\n\r\noperational capacity.  These two factors together  constrain its\r\n\r\napplication.  The same applies to the human brain.  If you  want\r\n\r\nto  insist on one model of language policy for all students  and\r\n\r\nfix  a  uniform  standard  for all, it  will  not  work.   After\r\n\r\nimplementing  our  bilingual policy for some three  decades,  we\r\n\r\nhave  learnt  to  be  flexible and sensitive  to  the  different\r\n\r\ncapacities  of  the students.   This is to reduce the  attrition\r\n\r\nrate in our education system because if the policy is too rigid,\r\n\r\ncertain  people  will be sacrificed. With  this  new  policy,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve we will be able to encourage all students to learn their\r\n\r\nmother tongue according to their aptitude and ability.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe advantage of this new policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good policy is one that is realistic and capable of adapting\r\n\r\nto  the different situations.  At the same time, I would like to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that  the  Government must  adopt  a  more  positive\r\n\r\napproach to ensure that our society will not suffer in the  long\r\n\r\nrun.    In  other words, our bilingual policy will  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  unshaken  for a long time to come.   From  the  policy\r\n\r\nstatement of DPM Lee, it is noted that the Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas already paid attention to the fact that a  small\r\n\r\ngroup of students have  difficulty in learning Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it is noteworthy that more and more Chinese\r\n\r\nfamilies  are  switching to English as the  language  spoken  at\r\n\r\nhome,  unlike  in  the  past  when  dialects  or  Mandarin   was\r\n\r\npredominant.   In  other  words, for  children  born  into  such\r\n\r\nfamilies, their mother tongue is English and not Mandarin or any\r\n\r\nof  the Chinese dialects.  The emergence of such a situation has\r\n\r\na  very  serious effect on our language policy.  It is  a  great\r\n\r\nchallenge  to  us.  It will possibly give rise to the  following\r\n\r\nsituations:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Parents of English-speaking families, because of their\r\n\r\nprejudice against the Chinese language, will resist it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Parents themselves realise the importance of their\r\n\r\nchildren  learning Chinese. Subjectively,  they hope that  their\r\n\r\nchildren  will  learn and master the Chinese language.  But  the\r\n\r\nstudents  themselves encounter difficulties in  the  process  of\r\n\r\nlearning  Chinese  in school.  There is a sort of  psychological\r\n\r\npressure  on  the  parents.   The parents  will  then  turn  the\r\n\r\npressure on the Government to lighten their children's burden on\r\n\r\nthe study of Chinese language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am worried about the second situation because children from\r\n\r\nthe  purely  English-speaking families  tend  to  find  learning\r\n\r\nChinese  more  difficult because they have to start  from  zero,\r\n\r\nunlike  those who come from Chinese-speaking families  who  must\r\n\r\ncertainly enjoy a head-start.  In these circumstances,  does  it\r\n\r\nmean  that the bilingual education policy will one day face such\r\n\r\ngreat  pressure from the anxious English-speaking  parents  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government will be forced to lower the standard of  Chinese\r\n\r\nin  school.   Even at this present moment when we are having  an\r\n\r\nestablished bilingual education policy in place, we are  finding\r\n\r\nthe  grounds more and more difficult to defend.  In  future,  we\r\n\r\nmay  even succumb to pressure and go into a monolingual society.\r\n\r\nI believe we do not like to see such a situation arising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are introducing CL `B' for students who have\r\n\r\ndifficulty in learning Chinese.  According to the present\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nestimate,  the  number  of  such  students  is  not\r\n\r\nsignificant.   But,  with  the transformation  of  the  language\r\n\r\nbackground of the younger families, the number of such  students\r\n\r\nis  bound  to increase in future, that is to say, there  may  be\r\n\r\nmore  and  more students opting for CL `B' in future.   If  this\r\n\r\nhappens,  we  can foresee that by that time, these students  and\r\n\r\ntheir  parents  will  be putting pressure  on  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  to  recognise  the result of  CL  `B'  at  `O'  level\r\n\r\nexamination  for admission to the junior college,  and  at   `A'\r\n\r\nlevel examination for university matriculation.  I certainly  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish to see this situation arising.   However, we  must  be\r\n\r\npsychologically prepared for such a situation to  arise  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   In  the  interest  of our nation,  apart  from  taking\r\n\r\npreventive  measures, we must also take positive  and  proactive\r\n\r\nmeasures   to  strengthen  the  overall  environment   for   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of bilingualism in our society.  In other  word,  we\r\n\r\nmust continue to insist on making Mandarin work in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say we have been very successful in our Speak\r\n\r\nMandarin  campaign.  I  do not think so.   I  think  the  future\r\n\r\nchallenge  is even greater, especially in the Chinese community.\r\n\r\nThe  promotion of Mandarin-speaking is still a very big task  to\r\n\r\naccomplish.    The  Chinese  community  should   recognise   the\r\n\r\ntransformation  of  language background of  the  ethnic  Chinese\r\n\r\nfamilies in Singapore. The Chinese community should put in  more\r\n\r\nefforts  to promote the use of Mandarin in our society.  Chinese\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  treated merely as a subject  to  be  learnt  in\r\n\r\nschool.  It should be promoted as a useful tool of communication\r\n\r\nin  our  society.  It  is only then that  we  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\neffectively preserve our bilingual education policy.  It  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  long-term  interest  of  our country  that  the   bilingual\r\n\r\neducation policy be maintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the policy statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have three\r\n\r\nregrets.   The  first regret is that we have to debate  such  an\r\n\r\nimportant  issue  in Parliament without due notice  in  advance.\r\n\r\nThere are so much\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmaterials for us to absorb and analyse,  yet  these\r\n\r\nmaterials  were distributed to us only when DPM Lee  was  making\r\n\r\nhis  speech in Parliament. We have no time to digest  all  these\r\n\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I heard Mr Kenneth Chen talking about his son who was\r\n\r\ndenied a place in our local university because he could not pass\r\n\r\nhis CL2, and had to send him overseas to get his degree.   In my\r\n\r\ngeneration,  many of my classmates could not gain  admission  to\r\n\r\nuniversity because their English was no good, and they  did  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  means to go overseas for further study.  This  is  my\r\n\r\nsecond regret.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we need to bring this issue on the standard and\r\n\r\nlearning of Chinese in our schools to this House for discussion.\r\n\r\nI  have  never  heard  of the Japanese complaining  about  their\r\n\r\nchildren  having problems coping with the Japanese  language  in\r\n\r\nschool, or the children in Germany having difficulty coping with\r\n\r\nthe  learning  of their own language.  I think  the  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  ponder  over this  question:  why  does  this\r\n\r\nproblem  arise at all?  Perhaps our situation is unique.    This\r\n\r\nis something that we need to think about seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the language policy is a very important\r\n\r\npolicy of the nation.  It is not just a superficial policy  that\r\n\r\ninvolves  just  the application of a language in  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem.    It   actually  involves  our  people's   ability   of\r\n\r\nexpression, their upbringing, and the differences in our values.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the direction in which our language policy is heading?\r\n\r\nShall  we use Chinese as a mainstream language or English  as  a\r\n\r\nmainstream  language,  or  any other language  as  a  mainstream\r\n\r\nlanguage?  Of course, the value will become the mainstream value\r\n\r\nof our society.  So the direction we take will eventually decide\r\n\r\nwhat  type of society we will develop into. So I feel  that  the\r\n\r\nlanguage  policy  is  not just an education  policy.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nnational policy of great importance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have been implementing the so-called\r\n\r\nbilingual  education  system for  the  past  few  decades.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  is: what is the definition of a bilingual system?   In\r\n\r\nthe old days, students\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the  Chinese schools used Chinese  as  a  first\r\n\r\nlanguage  and  English as a second language.  For those  in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  language  schools, English was the first  language  and\r\n\r\nChinese  was  promoted  as one of the second  languages  or  not\r\n\r\npromoted  at  all.   Now we do not have the  so-called  \"Chinese\r\n\r\nstream\" or \"English stream\".  The first language is English  and\r\n\r\napart  from  those  taking  Higher  Chinese,  mother  tongue  is\r\n\r\nbasically  a  second  language.  So, is our so-called  bilingual\r\n\r\neducation a misnomer? It gives people the misconception that  we\r\n\r\nare  bilingual.  But, in fact, the levels of our  languages  are\r\n\r\nvastly  lopsided.  So we should not call it a bilingual  system.\r\n\r\nIt  should be more appropriately known as a mother tongue system\r\n\r\nwhere  Malay, Tamil or Chinese is a second language.   Actually,\r\n\r\nwhat  we  should  be  concerned  with  is  the  effect  of   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of CL `B' on the future development of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am more worried about the ability of expression of our people.\r\n\r\nFor  English-speaking  people, they may not  be  able  to  speak\r\n\r\nChinese because their standard of Chinese is no good.  But  most\r\n\r\nof  the  time,  they will be able to absorb the essence  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  language.   They  will be able  to  express  themselves\r\n\r\nfairly  well in English.  But, on the other hand, for those  who\r\n\r\ncome  from Chinese-speaking families, they cannot speak  English\r\n\r\nwell,  and because of the second language system in our  school,\r\n\r\ntheir  standard of Chinese is also not good enough for  them  to\r\n\r\nexpress  themselves  well.  So it results in  neither  here  nor\r\n\r\nthere.   In the end, their Chinese is no good and their  English\r\n\r\nis  also  no good.  From the younger generation that I  know,  I\r\n\r\nhave  already  noticed that this problem is  very  serious.   In\r\n\r\ntheir  conversation, they mix Chinese with  English.   They  are\r\n\r\nunable to speak and express eloquently in one language.  This is\r\n\r\nsomething that we should be worried about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the standard of Chinese language, first of all,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  to decide what is the bottomline  for  its\r\n\r\ndesired  level of the Chinese language.  Is the bottomline  such\r\n\r\nthat  Chinese, being one of the official languages in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwill continue to be used in Singapore or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo  you want to promote Chinese  as  a  gateway  to\r\n\r\nunderstanding Chinese culture or to use it as a means  to  train\r\n\r\nthe  so-called  Chinese elite?  I think the  different  purposes\r\n\r\nwill  decide  what will be the appropriate standard  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage we want to have.  If Chinese is just to be regarded  as\r\n\r\nan  official language so that it could continue to  be  used  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  then very simply, a lower standard would suffice  to\r\n\r\nserve  the  Government's policy.  As long as you can  speak  and\r\n\r\nunderstand it, that is enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you want to use Chinese as a means to enhance our\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the Chinese culture, what standard do you need?\r\n\r\nIf  you  want  to cultivate a Chinese elite, what would  be  the\r\n\r\nappropriate  standard we must achieve?  If we want  to  train  a\r\n\r\nChinese  elite,  do  we  not want to have  more  ethnic  Chinese\r\n\r\nstudents  attaining  a  certain level of  proficiency  in  their\r\n\r\nChinese,  or  just a handful of elite who can  attain  a  higher\r\n\r\nlevel  of  Chinese language proficiency?  I think the Government\r\n\r\nshould look into it, because different people may have different\r\n\r\nneeds.  If you say  you require our students to learn only up to\r\n\r\nprimary  school level or, say, 1,000 words, then so be it.   But\r\n\r\nlet  everybody be very clear about it.  Let us know what is  the\r\n\r\nbottomline,  what is the requirement.  On the  other  hand,  for\r\n\r\nthose who are very keen to learn the Chinese language, let  them\r\n\r\nknow the limits that can be offered in our schools, so that they\r\n\r\nwill  not  have false hope.  The Chinese language teachers  will\r\n\r\nalso have a good idea of the standard they must achieve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is, like what Mr Goh Choon Kang has said just\r\n\r\nnow, the proposed CL `B'.  There would be some inherent problems\r\n\r\nthat come with the introduction of CL `B'.  Would this be a  new\r\n\r\nstandard   of  requirement  of  the  Government?    Would   this\r\n\r\nbottomline  be further lowered because of pressure from  certain\r\n\r\nquarters?   If  we look at the background of the students,  they\r\n\r\nhave  this  problem  because they come from an  English-speaking\r\n\r\nfamily.   This  is something that is inevitable,  but  it  is  a\r\n\r\nvicious cycle.  Now, just because these students come from  such\r\n\r\na  background,  we provide a lower level CL `B'  to  suit  them.\r\n\r\nEventually, it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  come a time when there  are  more  and  more\r\n\r\nstudents opting to go into CL `B'.  Later on in life, when these\r\n\r\nstudents  get married, have children of their own, the  language\r\n\r\nof  communication  will  again be English,  and  more  and  more\r\n\r\nfamilies  will be speaking English.  So this becomes  a  vicious\r\n\r\ncycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the survey report, when the students grow older,\r\n\r\ntheir  interest  in  learning  Chinese  becomes  more  and  more\r\n\r\nminimal.  In Primary 2, 51.3% of students say they like  Chinese\r\n\r\nvery  much.   But when it comes to junior college,  only  5%  of\r\n\r\nstudents  are very interested in Chinese.  Why is there  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation?  I think we should look into this matter from liking,\r\n\r\nvery  fond of the language, until a point where they do not like\r\n\r\nthe  language,  or even hate the language.  We should  find  out\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  reason for this.  If we want to cultivate  a  so-called  Chinese elite or to enhance the standard of Chinese,  it\r\n\r\nis  not only just to speak Chinese but to attain such a standard\r\n\r\nwhere  you  will  be able to read, understand and  analyse  some\r\n\r\narticles  in Chinese.  Teaching Chinese as a subsidiary  subject\r\n\r\nin school is just not enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should consider having some other examination\r\n\r\nsubjects,  eg, history or literature, being taught  in  Chinese,\r\n\r\nand  examined in Chinese. Through the learning of these subjects\r\n\r\nin  Chinese, those students who are interested in Chinese  would\r\n\r\nbe  able to attain a certain standard in the language that  will\r\n\r\nenable  them  to  read  Chinese  as  a  major  subject  in   the\r\n\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, the crux of the matter is, basically, people\r\n\r\nwho  have  very  little  contact with Chinese  will  have  great\r\n\r\ndifficulty learning it. I must admit that Chinese is not an easy\r\n\r\nlanguage  to  learn because it is a very different  system  from\r\n\r\nEnglish  and the other western languages. The Chinese  word,  or\r\n\r\ncharacter,  is an ideograph, unlike romanised spelling  like  in\r\n\r\nEnglish.  Chinese is more difficult to learn, but then we should\r\n\r\nnot emphasise on the economic value of Chinese all the time.   I\r\n\r\nthink we should ask ourselves this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquestion:  As an ethnic Chinese, should I not  know\r\n\r\nChinese?    This is a basic question.  It is not a  question  of\r\n\r\nwhether  it has any economic value or not.  The correct attitude\r\n\r\nshould  be:  I need to, at least, have a basic understanding,  a\r\n\r\nbasic  level of competence, in handling the language.   I  think\r\n\r\nthe  question of level, how to adjust, to fine-tune and to adapt\r\n\r\nto  the needs of the students from the different backgrounds, is\r\n\r\nsecondary.  Most  importantly, we  must  cultivate  the  correct\r\n\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few things that we have to pay attention to. First,\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  stand on Chinese.  What is  the  Government's\r\n\r\nstand?   What  is  the Government's expectation  of  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?  What is the basic requirement?  Will this bottomline\r\n\r\nbe changing all the time, and eventually it will come to a point\r\n\r\nwhere  you  may or may not have Chinese at all.  So I think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  take  a very clear  stand  on  its  required\r\n\r\nstandard that is expected of the Chinese students in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Chinese language teachers are also a very\r\n\r\nimportant  factor.  Traditionally,  Chinese  teachers  are  more\r\n\r\nserious  in  nature.   But it is common knowledge  that  when  a\r\n\r\nstudent does not like the teacher, he or she will also hate  the\r\n\r\nsubject  he  teaches.   So if you want  the  students  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nlearning Chinese, the Chinese language teachers should also  try\r\n\r\nto  be  more relaxed in their teaching.  They should not  be  so\r\n\r\nstern   all  the  time.    They  should  introduce  more  lively\r\n\r\nmaterials.   I  think  the  Chinese  language  teachers   should\r\n\r\nseriously look into this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, for the people who work in the Chinese educational,\r\n\r\ncultural  and  journalistic fields, we should try  to  tell  the\r\n\r\nstories  from ancient China in a more lively mood, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan be accepted by the younger generation.  We all know that the\r\n\r\nanimated movie Mulan, which is a Walt Disney production  in  the\r\n\r\nUSA,  was  taken from a traditional Chinese story.  But  it  was\r\n\r\ntranslated  and  produced as a full-length Walt Disney  animated\r\n\r\nmovie.  Students  from Chinese-speaking background  or  English-speaking environment alike fall for the repackaged story.  It is\r\n\r\nthe new packaging that makes the difference!\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving\r\n\r\nme  these  few  moments.  I just want to seek a  few  points  of\r\n\r\nclarification and make some suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already there is a certain degree of stigmatisation amongst\r\n\r\nstudents  in CL1 and those in CL2.  By creating another syllabus\r\n\r\n`B'  and category of students, will we create another stigma and\r\n\r\nrisk  overall demoralisation?  I hope the Minister will  comment\r\n\r\non  this.  As I read here, he said that while a pass in  CL  `B'\r\n\r\nsyllabus  at  the  `O' and `A' level examinations  will  qualify\r\n\r\nstudents to enter JC and university, the CL `B' syllabus  result\r\n\r\ncannot  be used to compute the `O' level aggregate for admission\r\n\r\ninto  JC  or  earn  any  `A' level points  used  for  university\r\n\r\nadmission.   Are we having another ranking order as  to  who  is\r\n\r\ngood and who is not good enough?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is: could the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  take  the lead in reviewing  the  methodology  in\r\n\r\nteaching language in schools and commit resources for retraining\r\n\r\nof  teachers  and new pedagogic equipment to make learning  more\r\n\r\ninteresting?   I  suggest  that  the  Review  Committee  involve\r\n\r\nstudent  bodies  to  give their reflections and  suggestions  on\r\n\r\ntheir experience of learning Chinese.  Take my own example.   My\r\n\r\nchildren  learn  Chinese better with songs and  by  watching  of\r\n\r\nChinese  TV programmes.  Maybe we should encourage some watching\r\n\r\nof  TV programmes in schools at certain hours and use that as  a\r\n\r\nbasis for discussion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to bring up is that I do not\r\n\r\ndisagree  about Chinese classics being important, as brought  up\r\n\r\nby Mr Peh Chin Hua on Shui Hu Zhuan (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) and Hong\r\n\r\nLou Meng (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). But I urge the Education\r\n\r\nCommittee not to stress the messages in the stories but  instead\r\n\r\nfocus on the literary interest of the stories because it is very\r\n\r\nboring and, from the way I do it with my children, it is a  hard\r\n\r\nuphill struggle.  We need creative approaches and I think Mr Low\r\n\r\nThia Khiang's suggestion like Hua Mu Lan (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)\r\n\r\nis a very good one.  We need new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npackaging.   We  need to review the whole lot of  materials  and\r\n\r\nfind creative pedagogic materials for teaching this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to try and disentangle is the\r\n\r\nnotion  of  a  language  and culture.   When  does  learning  or\r\n\r\nstressing  a  language  become  divisive?   I  feel  learning  a\r\n\r\nlanguage  is  just  another  tool  towards  understanding  one's\r\n\r\nculture.  It only becomes divisive if we use language to exclude\r\n\r\nsegments   of  Singaporeans  from  the  mainstream  agenda   and\r\n\r\nprogrammes. I do not think this is what we set out to do.  But I\r\n\r\nlike  to  say that we need to be a little relaxed about language\r\n\r\nand culture.  We can learn about Chinese culture without knowing\r\n\r\nChinese, through translation.  It will be better if we can learn\r\n\r\na  culture  through the language.  But today, in the newspapers,\r\n\r\nwe  learn  of  a whole group of scholars talking about  Mencius.\r\n\r\nAnd  they  are  Americans.   Yes, some  of  them  speak  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage but a lot of them do not.  But they learn it.  So I  am\r\n\r\nsaying  that, besides looking at the language barrier, maybe  we\r\n\r\nshould  look at our own interest.  And I would like to  echo  Mr\r\n\r\nLow  Thia  Khiang's call just now that we need to  develop  that\r\n\r\ninterest first even for those English educated.  If we have that\r\n\r\ninterest, we will get to any culture.  Like all of us know a lot\r\n\r\nabout English Literature, we are not English.  Some of us know a\r\n\r\nlot  of  French Literature, but we do not speak  French.   So  I\r\n\r\nthink we need to disentangle that.  Having said that, I must say\r\n\r\nlearning  a  language  does create the intimacy  and  depth  for\r\n\r\nlearning the culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is we must first define ourselves as Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nbesides  being Chinese, or Malay, or Indian.  And I think  being\r\n\r\nSingaporean  is more than speaking a specific language.   So  on\r\n\r\nthe  concerns raised by Mr Simon Tay earlier on, I feel that  if\r\n\r\nwe  all  share  in  a  common identity and  try  to  hone  that,\r\n\r\nspecialising in a language is not a threat.  And here,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to take up Dr Tan Cheng Bock's point on the Chinese elite.\r\n\r\nI  am  uncomfortable with the word as well because it  reeks  of\r\n\r\nclass status.  And I have in other occasions suggested the words\r\n\r\n\"Chinese  specialist\",  \"Malay specialist\",  \"Tamil  specialist\"\r\n\r\ninstead of using the word \"elite\".  My\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvision  for  Singapore  is  really a multi-cultural  and  multi-lingual  Singapore characterised by all these  specialists,  who\r\n\r\nstanding  on  their own cultural heritage, are able to  appraise\r\n\r\nthe world and the other cultures around them and help to nourish\r\n\r\na Singapore identity that can be shared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take my own example. I grew up in Little India. I was in a\r\n\r\nChinese  language school and my parents, being kiasu, pulled  me\r\n\r\nout  from Nan Hua and put me in Raffles where I learned English.\r\n\r\nI had wished that I had continued with a Chinese language school\r\n\r\nso  that I will be steeped in one language because it is easy to\r\n\r\npick  up  English.   So I hope this policy is one  step  towards\r\n\r\nredressing  some of the challenges we faced decades  earlier  by\r\n\r\ncreating cultural or language specialists that will be  good  in\r\n\r\none  language and reasonably and acceptably good in another, but\r\n\r\nfirst  and foremost, they use the language to express themselves\r\n\r\nas Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\npersonally delighted by the changes contained in the Ministerial\r\n\r\nStatement.   I  am  assured  by the  spirit  and  commitment  to\r\n\r\nbilingual policy.  It has served us well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problems confronting the Chinese community which\r\n\r\nnecessitate  these  changes  are not  peculiar  to  the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity.   It  is a nationwide phenomenon affecting  both  the\r\n\r\nIndian  and  Malay  communities although these communities  have\r\n\r\nbeen far more successful in insulating themselves from otherwise\r\n\r\nnegative  consequences to their culture, language and tradition.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  think  this  is how other communities should  see  these\r\n\r\nchanges.  However, I hope that references to China as a dominant\r\n\r\neconomic power does not detract from the fact that Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia today remain one of the largest trading partners, that\r\n\r\nMalay  and  Tamil still possess strong economic  value  so  that\r\n\r\nMalay students and Indian students are not unnecessarily tempted\r\n\r\nto learn Chinese for the wrong reasons.  It is just\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  businesses with these countries are concluded in  English,\r\n\r\nespecially  among  MNCs, and in Chinese among the  smaller  SMEs\r\n\r\nsimply  because  Chinese businessmen are still  the  predominant\r\n\r\nbusiness  community  in the region.  The  Malay  community,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  should feel assured that proficiency in Malay language\r\n\r\nis  not  only  important  for  culture  and  tradition  but  has\r\n\r\nimportant  economic implications and value to  Singapore.   They\r\n\r\nmust continue in their stride to excel in these languages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans to better accommodate non-Chinese students in SAP\r\n\r\nschools  are  indeed very reassuring.  I am therefore encouraged\r\n\r\nby the assurance given by DPM that similar reviews would be done\r\n\r\nfor  the  learning  of  Malay and Tamil because  the  issues  of\r\n\r\nlanguage  are also important and sensitive to the Malay,  Indian\r\n\r\nand  Eurasian  communities.   The communities  would  indeed  be\r\n\r\ninterested to know how different these students are compared  to\r\n\r\nChinese students in coping with, say, Malay or English.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to another point about the peculiar problems of\r\n\r\nchildren  from mixed marriages.  They, like me, do not have  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  having both parents competent in  the  same  second\r\n\r\nlanguage.   These students need a scheme similar to  CL  `B'  in\r\n\r\nMalay  and  Tamil - a development, Sir, which I personally  wait\r\n\r\nmost eagerly.  As mixed marriages become more prevalent, a multi-racial and multi-cultural family is a natural phenomenon of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  CL `B' and, hopefully, ML `B' or TL `B' should be seen\r\n\r\nand be made part of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir, for allowing\r\n\r\nme to join in this debate.  I have to mention that I regret that\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition was not informed of this important debate  prior\r\n\r\nto the announcement.  I believe Mr Low and I come unprepared for\r\n\r\nthis  important debate.  So far, it has taken almost  the  whole\r\n\r\nday to show the interest it has generated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am basically monolingual and even my dialect, Teochew, is\r\n\r\nrather weak.  I have gone through four elections and I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanaged  to win four elections.  But, please, I tell the younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, do not take me as an example.  They  should  learn\r\n\r\ntheir  second  language or their mother tongue because  it  will\r\n\r\nwiden their horizon and open new vistas, as other speakers  have\r\n\r\nsaid.   I remember in the 60s, after Stalin had died, there  was\r\n\r\none  Mr Khruschev who took over from Stalin.  He visited America\r\n\r\nand of course he was remembered for banging the shoes at the  UN\r\n\r\nmeeting.   But  I  remember him saying, when the reporter  asked\r\n\r\nhim,  \"Do  you understand, or can you speak English?\"  He  said,\r\n\r\n\"Not   yet.\"    He  said,  \"Why  bother?   I  have  always   got\r\n\r\ninterpreters  to do it for me.\"  That may be good  for  leaders.\r\n\r\nBut  for  the  ordinary person, we cannot  have  an  interpreter\r\n\r\nmoving with us all the time.  We must know the language.  If  we\r\n\r\nwant  to communicate with somebody, it is better to speak  their\r\n\r\nlanguage.   We  have  to  know  the  language.   Languages   are\r\n\r\nimportant.  In fact, we should not only learn one mother tongue,\r\n\r\nbut if given the opportunity, we should learn other languages as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just visited Japan. Fortunately, I have already taken up\r\n\r\nlearning of Mandarin and I do not understand a word of Japanese.\r\n\r\nBut  I  managed  to  get around because I  could  recognise  the\r\n\r\nChinese  characters which they use.   They call  it  Kanji.   So\r\n\r\nlanguage is important.  There is no doubt about that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message that I want to make is: do not leave it until\r\n\r\nit  is  too  late, like in my case.  I find it  a  big  struggle\r\n\r\nlearning  Mandarin  because our muscles, especially  around  the\r\n\r\njaw,  are already sagged and it is difficult for me to pronounce\r\n\r\nsome Mandarin words like si shi, jue de, jian kang.  There is no\r\n\r\nequivalent in English. Even at my age, I have got to go  through\r\n\r\nthese lessons.   If I read for half an hour, my jaw is all tired\r\n\r\nafter pronouncing the words.  So do not leave it until it is too\r\n\r\nlate.   What  should we do then if we really want to  teach  our\r\n\r\nchildren the language?  I would say, start them off as early  as\r\n\r\npossible, even at 2 1/2 years old.  Of course, the best  way  to\r\n\r\nteach  a  child or a person a language is what they call  \"total\r\n\r\nimmersion\".  If you want to learn a language, if you are already\r\n\r\nan adult, the best place is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  go  and stay in that country for 3 months, 6 months  or  one\r\n\r\nyear, and you will master the language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a child, those from English-speaking\r\n\r\nbackground,  I would advise that they send their children  to  a\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking  kindergarten, if there is any,  and  put  them\r\n\r\nthrough  a  Chinese-speaking kindergarten, if possible,  through\r\n\r\nChinese  primary school.  By the time they come out from primary\r\n\r\nschool,  they can already speak Chinese for sure.  And at  home,\r\n\r\nof course, if they speak English, they will have no problem with\r\n\r\nEnglish.  I think that is the best solution.  But I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether we have this kind of system in Singapore.  Actually,  Mr\r\n\r\nGoh Choon Kang said just now that the Speak Mandarin Campaign is\r\n\r\nnot  going on too well.  The statistics show it.  In 1998,  20%;\r\n\r\n10 years later, 40% English-speaking homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid that the Government is losing the battle as far\r\n\r\nas promotion of Mandarin speaking is concerned.  So what must it\r\n\r\ndo?   As  Mdm Claire Chiang has rightly pointed out, they should\r\n\r\nmake  the  language more interesting.  Look at  the  methodology\r\n\r\nand, above all, you must make the child love the language.  Once\r\n\r\nhe  has got a love for the language, it will be much easier.  It\r\n\r\nis  of  course good for adults if we tell them that it  will  be\r\n\r\nuseful  if they are going to China to do business.  But  if  you\r\n\r\ntell  a six-year old child that if he can speak Chinese, it will\r\n\r\nbe  useful next time if he goes to China where he can earn a lot\r\n\r\nof  money, he will not understand.  So you must find  a  way  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  language or subject more interesting, and  make  them\r\n\r\nlove it.  This was what I was taught when I was in the Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining  College.   Whether  it  is  Mathematics,  Science   or\r\n\r\nlanguage, these are the more difficult subjects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message is that you must alter our methodology rather\r\n\r\nthan  use a popular policy to lower the standard of Chinese.   I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  that will be a solution.  In fact, our  standard\r\n\r\nmust   be  maintained.   If  the  children  cannot  attain  that\r\n\r\nstandard,  we have to look at the educational reasons  why  they\r\n\r\ncannot  reach  that standard, rather than to take  a  convenient\r\n\r\nroute out\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  lower  the standard.  How low can we go?  CL2, CL  `B'  and\r\n\r\nthen what, CL `C'?  I do not think that is the correct way.   No\r\n\r\ndoubt  it is a popular method of lowering the standard and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Look,  my  child has passed Chinese, but do not  say  \"B\".\"   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  solution  is  to find a good  methodology,  make  it\r\n\r\ninteresting, make the children love the subject.   That  is  the\r\n\r\nway.   And of course, if you can have total immersion when  they\r\n\r\nare young, that would be even better still.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like myself, I come from an English-speaking background and\r\n\r\nmy   daughter   managed   to  go  through   a   Chinese-speaking\r\n\r\nkindergarten  and  a  SAP primary school.   And  when  she  took\r\n\r\nChinese, there was no problem.  Maybe she is a female, I do  not\r\n\r\nknow.   Anyway, she got through her Chinese and she  did  rather\r\n\r\nwell at it, and she is also learning French and other languages.\r\n\r\nI  think  it is the motivation.  As for myself, I was in  school\r\n\r\nwhen  Singapore  was still a colony and I went to  a  well-known\r\n\r\nmission  school  which did not seem to encourage  the  study  of\r\n\r\nChinese.  In fact, it was not prestigious at all when I  was  in\r\n\r\nschool to study Chinese.  It was more prestigious to study Latin\r\n\r\nand  of  course I managed to get through Latin which I  am  very\r\n\r\nproud.   But  if  I had spent the same time and effort  studying\r\n\r\nChinese, I think I would be very much better off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a monolingual person, I do not think that is a very\r\n\r\ngood  thing.   We  should study Chinese and being  in  a  multi-lingual  place  like  Singapore, our  children  should  also  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to study Malay.  I know DPM has said that  our  brain\r\n\r\nis  finite and we cannot study too many languages, but if it  is\r\n\r\npossible,  we  should  master a  little  bit  of  Malay.   I  am\r\n\r\nsurprised  that when young Singaporeans today, going across  the\r\n\r\nCauseway, see a notice in Malay, they are completely at a  loss.\r\n\r\nThey cannot recognise even a few words.  That is very bad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are serious about promoting the Chinese language, I\r\n\r\nagree with Mr Ang Mong Seng who said that we should have another\r\n\r\nuniversity, a Chinese university.  If\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  is  not  possible,  then  we should  enlarge  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nDepartment  at  NUS, make it a bigger department  to  train  the\r\n\r\nnecessary journalists, teachers, broadcasters and the like.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these are all the points I want to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nInformation  and  the Arts (Mr Yatiman Yusof)  (In  Malay):   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, after listening to the speeches on the Chinese language\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, and the supportive speeches made by my friends in\r\n\r\nthis House, I would like to contribute my views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the question of language is important because\r\n\r\nit  is  a matter related to the teaching, absorption and efforts\r\n\r\nto  learn  a language.  It is important because language  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  factor  in  developing the  mind.   It  is  important\r\n\r\nbecause  our attitude towards language will help the development\r\n\r\nof  our  community - either it is very close in its  outlook  or\r\n\r\nvery  open.   Thirdly, the question of language policy  requires\r\n\r\nlong-term  consideration.  An example is when we introduced  the\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual policy in 1959, where the schools were  encouraged\r\n\r\nto  teach  in  various  languages - Malay,  Tamil,  English  and\r\n\r\nChinese - it produced people like Mr Opposition here and myself.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result  of this multi-lingual education system,  we  have\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  with different viewpoints but  at  the  same  time\r\n\r\nsharing what is fundamental to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of language is important in that it is closely\r\n\r\nrelated to the thinking process and culture.  Language taught us\r\n\r\nthe  norms  and what is culturally acceptable.  Our  ability  to\r\n\r\ncommand  a  language will reflect our views on development  from\r\n\r\nthe  perspective of the culture of our upbringing.  That is  why\r\n\r\nwe should find ways now to provide the solutions to questions of\r\n\r\nlanguage that we face in schools.  We have, at some early  time,\r\n\r\nintroduced a language policy.  The language policy of  1959  and\r\n\r\nits emphasis was meant to achieve political objective as part of\r\n\r\nour  merger plan with Malaysia and in 1965 when we got out  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  changed the language policy because Singapore would have  to\r\n\r\nface  reality  as  an  independent  state.   We  introduced  the\r\n\r\nbilingualism  policy  in  order  to  achieve  a  city  state  of\r\n\r\nexcellence  and  at  the  same time,  created  our  own  special\r\n\r\nidentity.  As a country in the East, we use the English language\r\n\r\nas  the  working language and mother tongue as a bridge  to  our\r\n\r\ncultural values.  This is important because we do not want to be\r\n\r\nlike  the  people  in  the Caribbean or in  South  Africa  where\r\n\r\nEnglish  is  the  main language - an important language  in  the\r\n\r\ncountries  and  that their local culture and language  ties  are\r\n\r\ncompletely removed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore learns from the experience of these foreign\r\n\r\ncommunities and we are confident that we can always  avoid  this\r\n\r\ndivision  of  monolingualism becoming relative by upholding  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of bilingualism.  Our problem  now is not only to  cater\r\n\r\nfor  the  different  abilities to learn the language  among  the\r\n\r\nchildren  in  schools,  but to fulfil  our  aspirations  and  to\r\n\r\nencourage  efforts from parents and the community at large.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to  accept the different attitudes towards and the ability\r\n\r\nto  learn the language.  And I see the statement by the  DPM  as\r\n\r\nthe  way  to achieve this basic objective - a community that  is\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  yet united, one that can understand the  situation\r\n\r\nsurrounding ourselves and, at the same time, able to acquire the\r\n\r\nlatest technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stress on such a policy is a practical way in securing\r\n\r\nour economic interest, and we have got an excellent and balanced\r\n\r\napproach.  And this balanced approach is the provision  of  full\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  learn  English as the first  language  and  the\r\n\r\nmother  tongue (Mandarin, Malay and Tamil) as a second  language\r\n\r\nto  satisfy  their cultural, language and heritage requirements.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not easy to produce an efficient bilingualist.   Mr  Goh\r\n\r\nChoon Kang has explained that efficient bilingualism can only be\r\n\r\npractised  by  a  small  section  of  our  community.    To   be\r\n\r\nefficiently  bilingual,  one not only  can  fluently  speak  the\r\n\r\nlanguage, ie, speak in both languages but, at the same time,  is\r\n\r\nable to think quickly in both languages and is able to relate on\r\n\r\nmatters\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof in-depth cultural heritage.  Such efficient bilingualists are\r\n\r\nable  to understand the deep, intricate philosophical issues  in\r\n\r\ntwo  languages as well.  That is why they are rare  a  breed  of\r\n\r\npeople  and  because of this, professionalism in  the  study  of\r\n\r\nlanguage, as proposed by DPM, is the best way out and should  be\r\n\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, I am happy that the bilingualism\r\n\r\npolicy  gives equal opportunity to learn not only Mandarin,  but\r\n\r\nMalay and Tamil as well, through what they call, the possibility\r\n\r\nof  E/ML2,  E/ML2B,  TL2  and TL2B, and in  this  connection,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand the problem has not arisen yet.  The results of Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  students  show that Malay students  have  got  a  good\r\n\r\ncommand and performance of their language compared to the  other\r\n\r\nstudents.   At the same time, there are already increased  signs\r\n\r\nof  problems facing the second and third generation of the Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity and this trend is also at present faced by the Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity.  In future, it is better that we have flexibility for\r\n\r\nMalay and Tamil students as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the statement by the DPM.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  allow me to address some of the issues that have  been\r\n\r\nraised  by Members today before the Deputy Prime Minister rounds\r\n\r\nup the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, what is our language policy and what is the\r\n\r\nstandard  we  strive for in Chinese?  Sir, we live in  a  multi-racial   society.   Bilingualism  is  the  cornerstone  of   our\r\n\r\neducation  system.   Our  policy is for  English  as  the  first\r\n\r\nlanguage  and  the main language of instruction in our  schools.\r\n\r\nThis  policy  has  served us well.  It has given  us  access  to\r\n\r\ntechnology in the world.  It has served us well in business  and\r\n\r\nin  foreign relations.  It has also been a unifying factor among\r\n\r\nall the races in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy for the mother tongue, Chinese as well as Malay and\r\n\r\nTamil, and the other non-Tamil Indian languages, is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  every  child  to learn his mother tongue  for  as  long  as\r\n\r\npossible and to as high a level as possible.  There is therefore\r\n\r\nno  one standard that we can apply to the learning of the mother\r\n\r\ntongue.  We are not a homogenous society, like Germany or Japan.\r\n\r\nWe  are  a  multi-racial society.  Perhaps, if our society  were\r\n\r\nhomogenous and we were several degrees of latitude further north\r\n\r\nand  several degrees of longitude further east, we might be able\r\n\r\nto  achieve the aspirations that Mr Low Thia Khiang talks  about\r\n\r\nof  having  Chinese as the language in Singapore.   Instead,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to set standards that are appropriate.  Therefore, we have\r\n\r\nthe  standard bearer (we are talking about the Chinese  language\r\n\r\nnow)  and  the standard bearer is Higher Chinese, then  a  level\r\n\r\nwhich is suitable for the vast majority of Chinese Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nwhich is CL, and for those who despite putting in a considerable\r\n\r\neffort  are  unable to make it, CL `B'.  This set of  principles\r\n\r\nwill  also  apply  to  the  other  mother  tongue  languages  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the specific issues that have been\r\n\r\nraised  within this context and this structure of  the  language\r\n\r\npolicy  in Singapore.  First, CL `B'.  Dr Ow Chin Hock,  Dr  Ker\r\n\r\nSin Tze, Mr Peh Chin Hua and others have asked whether or not CL\r\n\r\n`B'  will  become  a soft option.  There is a remarkably  strong\r\n\r\ndesire  among Chinese Singaporeans today to study Chinese.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  at the PSLE, at the streaming at Primary 4,  something\r\n\r\nlike 13-14% of students qualify to do Higher Chinese in the  EM1\r\n\r\nstream, but in fact many parents opt for their children to study\r\n\r\nHigher  Chinese, so that something like 22-23% opt to do  Higher\r\n\r\nChinese.  This is one illustration of the strength of the desire\r\n\r\nfor  students in Singapore and for parents in Singapore to  want\r\n\r\ntheir children to study Higher Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only incentive that they have for this is really a couple of\r\n\r\nbonus points if they do decide to go to one of the nine, now 10,\r\n\r\nSAP  schools.   Otherwise, studying Higher  Chinese  in  primary\r\n\r\nschool gives them no other benefit beyond taking standard CL  in\r\n\r\nprimary school.  So even\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrelatively small incentives do encourage parents to want to have\r\n\r\ntheir  children  do Higher Chinese and also there  is  a  strong\r\n\r\ndesire,  other than incentive reasons, that parents  want  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to do Higher Chinese.  In fact, it would  seem  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  the  desire is so strong that even Mr Chiam is  trying  to\r\n\r\ncrack  his jaws to learn Chinese at his age.  It shows that  the\r\n\r\nSpeak  Mandarin  campaign does work, Mr Chiam, if  you  too  are\r\n\r\nstruggling to learn Chinese.  When we implement CL `B', we  will\r\n\r\nstill continue to encourage students to go as far as they can in\r\n\r\nChinese.  We have put in a number of incentives for students  to\r\n\r\nstudy  Higher  Chinese. Similarly, there will be incentives  for\r\n\r\nstudents to study CL as opposed to CL `B'.  Let me give  Members\r\n\r\na few examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we would do is to implement CL `B' from Secondary 3\r\n\r\nupwards, which means that students from Primary 1 to Secondary 2\r\n\r\nwill  study CL or HCL, and only if they are unable to cope,  the\r\n\r\nteachers  will of course be involved with this assessment,  will\r\n\r\nthey  be  given the option of taking CL `B'.  CL `B'  will  also\r\n\r\nonly  meet the qualification requirements for JC and university,\r\n\r\nwhich  means  that students give up something quite considerable\r\n\r\nwhen they take CL `B'.  This means that for JCs, they are unable\r\n\r\nto count their CL scores for admission to JC, and for university\r\n\r\nthey  do not get any point in the calculation of those 76 points\r\n\r\nfor  admission to university.  So when a student takes up CL `B'\r\n\r\nat  Secondary 3, he knows that there are implications along  the\r\n\r\nway.   The  benefit for him is that he will be able  to  do  the\r\n\r\nlanguage at the level which he can probably cope with and  would\r\n\r\nget  a  pass that would qualify him to JC or university, but  he\r\n\r\nwill  not get points which will give him an advantage over other\r\n\r\nstudents.   So  these are already fairly strong incentives,  and\r\n\r\ndisincentives, if you like, for taking CL as opposed to CL `B'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin has asked what schools would offer CL `B'. Our\r\n\r\nintention is that CL `B' would be available in all schools where\r\n\r\nthere  is a demand for it.  Of course, the SAP schools will  not\r\n\r\nbe  offering CL `B', as that would be running quite  counter  to\r\n\r\nwhat the SAP schools are there for.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang talks about stigmatisation and whether or not we\r\n\r\nwould be creating even more groups of students by introducing  a\r\n\r\nCL  `B'.   I would urge Mdm Chiang and all parents not to  treat\r\n\r\nstreaming and grouping of students in this rather, I would  say,\r\n\r\nold-fashioned way.  What we are trying to build in our education\r\n\r\nsystem  is  an  ability-driven system  where  we  will  try  and\r\n\r\ncustomise the courses and the programmes that the students take,\r\n\r\naccording  to  their  ability in those particular  subjects.   I\r\n\r\nwould  rather move away from this idea of stigmatisation and  to\r\n\r\nlook at it from the point of view of providing opportunities for\r\n\r\nstudents to play to their strength and still learn a basic level\r\n\r\nof other subjects where they are not as strong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move now to the opposite set of issues from CL `B',\r\n\r\nwhich is whether or not we can re-create Chinese schools of  the\r\n\r\npast.  I am surprised that Mr Chiam is advocating such a policy.\r\n\r\nAs I said, the bilingual policy has been in place for many years\r\n\r\nin Singapore and has served us well.  I do not see us going back\r\n\r\non that.  In fact, when given a choice today, parents opt to put\r\n\r\ntheir children in English stream and to study as much English as\r\n\r\npossible.   In  fact,  that  is one of  the  major  concerns  of\r\n\r\nparents.   We  do  have  a  stream  called  ME3,  which  is  the\r\n\r\ncomplement  of  the  EM3 stream in primary  school.   I  am  not\r\n\r\nsurprised that most Members have not heard of this, but  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  in existence since 1991.  In the ME3 stream, students  can\r\n\r\noffer mother tongue at first language level and basic English at\r\n\r\na  lower level.  But since it was introduced in 1991, no one has\r\n\r\nopted for this stream.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what we can do and what we will do is to create a strong\r\n\r\nenvironment for learning Chinese, for promoting Chinese  culture\r\n\r\nand  values  in  our  10  SAP schools.    We  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  these schools.  We have also opened up the  Language\r\n\r\nElective  Programme  in another junior college,  Nanyang  Junior\r\n\r\nCollege, and I am quite optimistic that this junior college will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to generate the functional specialists, if you prefer,\r\n\r\nthat  we would desire in our society.  In fact, quite at random,\r\n\r\nI  asked  two  students whom I met when I  visited  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nJunior\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCollege  what  they would like to do after they  have  finished.\r\n\r\nBoth  of them told me: to teach.  I was very heartened by  this.\r\n\r\nThree of the nine journalists who were there on that day for the\r\n\r\npress  conference came from Nanyang Junior College.  I was quite\r\n\r\nheartened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another set of issues was with regard to whether or not we\r\n\r\ncould  take  other subjects in Chinese as this would  provide  a\r\n\r\nbroader  range of experiences and a broader range in  which  the\r\n\r\nlanguage is used beyond just studying it as a language.  Mr  Peh\r\n\r\nChin  Hua,  Dr  Ow  Chin Hock and others raised  this.   Chinese\r\n\r\nLiterature is already available in our schools.  We are going to\r\n\r\nmake an Introduction to Appreciation of Chinese as an enrichment\r\n\r\ncourse  in the SAP schools for all the lower secondary students.\r\n\r\nWe  hope  that with this more of the students in the SAP schools\r\n\r\nwill be encouraged to take Chinese Literature.  We also have, at\r\n\r\nthe  junior college level, General Studies in Chinese.  This  is\r\n\r\nlike  GP,  but in Chinese.  Those students who have a particular\r\n\r\nlove  for  Chinese  and  a facility with the  language  do  take\r\n\r\nGeneral Studies in Chinese.  We hope that with the encouragement\r\n\r\nof a broader band of students taking CL in secondary schools and\r\n\r\nat  junior  college more students will be motivated to  take  up\r\n\r\nthese subjects as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third type of issue that I would like to raise is on\r\n\r\nteacher  and teaching methodology.  Mr Loh Meng See, Mr  Kenneth\r\n\r\nChen,  Prof.  Chin and Mdm Claire Chiang, among  others,  raised\r\n\r\nthis   issue.   I  particularly  welcome  Mr  Ang  Mong   Seng's\r\n\r\nencouragement  to our CL teachers. They work  very  hard.   They\r\n\r\nhave a difficult job to do and they try very hard to do it well.\r\n\r\nI  have spoken to the Teachers' Unions and I have spoken to many\r\n\r\nof  the  teachers, and they are putting in a lot  of  effort  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the teaching methodologies in the school.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nis  doing its best to recruit good Chinese teachers and for that\r\n\r\nmatter,  good  mother tongue teachers in all the  mother  tongue\r\n\r\nlanguages.   Again,  we  hope  that with  this  regeneration  of\r\n\r\nspecialists in Chinese we will be able to have a bigger pool  to\r\n\r\ndraw upon in order to recruit our Chinese language teachers.  In\r\n\r\nfact, when I visit the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nschools, I see both young and enthusiastic Chinese teachers, and\r\n\r\nI  see  also old and enthusiastic Chinese teachers.  It  is  the\r\n\r\napproach  that  they take and not their age, which  is  a  major\r\n\r\nfactor.   And in this area, both the Ministry and the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nUnions have been quite proactive in getting the teachers  to  be\r\n\r\ntrained and re-trained, in teaching methodologies, as well as in\r\n\r\nteaching  technologies, for example, in the use  of  information\r\n\r\ntechnology and computers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education, as you know, is putting in\r\n\r\ncomputers and information technology in schools in a major  way,\r\n\r\nand  we  are  also developing a lot of software for use  in  the\r\n\r\nmother  tongue languages.  This, I hope, will help to  make  the\r\n\r\nteaching and the learning of mother tongue more interesting.   I\r\n\r\nam  not sure if all the CD-ROMs will turn out like Mulan, but  I\r\n\r\nhope that the interactive nature and the fact that students  can\r\n\r\nlearn on their own, at their own pace, do revision, and look  at\r\n\r\nthe  things again and again if they want to, will help  them  to\r\n\r\nlearn better and to improve their standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said again, Sir, the basic principle upon which the\r\n\r\nlanguage policy in our schools is founded is quite clear.  There\r\n\r\nis  no  doubt  that we have bilingualism - English as  the  main\r\n\r\nlanguage, mother tongue to as high a level as possible.  We live\r\n\r\nin  a multi-racial society.  These are the facts that we have in\r\n\r\nSingapore and these are the factors upon which we have to try to\r\n\r\nbuild  both  a modern society open to the world, as  well  as  a\r\n\r\nsociety that is well-rooted in its traditions and its values.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I seek a clarification from the\r\n\r\nMinister?   The Minister has mentioned in his speech that  there\r\n\r\nis  a standard bearer of the Chinese language.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nknow from him what is the basic standard of Chinese that will be\r\n\r\nattainable, let us say, under the new scheme of CL `B'.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just explained\r\n\r\nthat we have to customise education in Singapore to students  of\r\n\r\ndifferent ability levels.  So Higher\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChinese  is  a  standard bearer, CL is a level  which  the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority of students can reach, and CL `B' will be a basic level\r\n\r\nwhich  students who face difficulties and have put in a  lot  of\r\n\r\neffort  should  be able to reach.  We expect  that  the  CL  `B'\r\n\r\nstandard will be somewhere about the Secondary (Normal) standard\r\n\r\nfor  Chinese,  but  with a heavier emphasis on  aural  and  oral\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Admiral Teo has\r\n\r\naddressed  most  of the points raised by the Members.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to sum up in Mandarin.  But before I do that, I just  want\r\n\r\nto  take up one important point which Admiral Teo did not cover,\r\n\r\nand  this was the remark by Dr Tan Cheng Bock that we should not\r\n\r\ntalk  about Chinese elite, and this was picked up by Mdm  Claire\r\n\r\nChiang.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can change the word, if you find another word more\r\n\r\nconvenient.   But  I think the argument is not about  vocabulary\r\n\r\nbut  about  a very important concept, which is this -  Singapore\r\n\r\nsociety  is  not homogenous.  It is multi-racial; it  is  multi-religious;  it  is multi-cultural.  And indeed even  within  the\r\n\r\nChinese  society, there is quite a clear differentiation between\r\n\r\nthe Chinese language group and the English-speaking group.  This\r\n\r\ndiversity, this variation, is in fact one of the sources of  our\r\n\r\nstrength.   It  is  like a rope with many fibres  in  it,  wound\r\n\r\ntogether, and therefore deriving strength from one another.   If\r\n\r\nwe  were homogenous as one Chinese-speaking society amongst  the\r\n\r\nChinese, I think we will be weaker as a country, because I think\r\n\r\nthe   link  between  the  Chinese  community  and  the  minority\r\n\r\ncommunities  will he harder to establish without  English  as  a\r\n\r\ncommon  ground.  If we were completely English-speaking  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese community, or minimally Chinese literate and mainly\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking,  I think we would also be weaker,  because  we\r\n\r\nwould  not  have that cultural anchor, that root, that strength,\r\n\r\nwhich  hold us in time of difficulty.  The people who  come  out\r\n\r\nfrom  the different streams come out in different moulds.   They\r\n\r\nare  different.   You  look at him, you watch  him  walk  a  few\r\n\r\nmetres, and you say, \"This one is a Hwa Chong child or Hwa Chong\r\n\r\nalumnus.\"  Or that is RI, and that one looks very much like  ACS\r\n\r\n- Mr\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChiam.   You can tell, they are different.  ACS is a  very  good\r\n\r\nschool; RI is an even better school.  Probably so, but if all of\r\n\r\nSingapore were ACSians and Rafflesians, I think we would be  the\r\n\r\npoorer  for it, because we would be without the Chinese schools,\r\n\r\nwe  would  be  without the people with the Islamic  culture,  we\r\n\r\nwould  be  without the Hindu culture.  And you would  lose  that\r\n\r\nballast and that sense of continuity and Asian roots, which  are\r\n\r\nimportant to our survival as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think in the future that Chinese component of our\r\n\r\nsociety will be exactly the same as it was in the past.  Because\r\n\r\nthe   historical  past  is  different,  the  circumstances   are\r\n\r\ndifferent,  the  situation  which made  the  Chinese  elite  and\r\n\r\nestablishment what it was before and after the world and in  the\r\n\r\n1960s  has changed.  We are in the 1990s, about to go  into  the\r\n\r\n21st century.  So the challenges are different.  But to want  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  that,  so that you not only have individuals  who  are\r\n\r\nvery  proficient  in  Chinese and can make  speeches;  not  only\r\n\r\nteachers,  journalists and Ministers but  also  a  certain  sub-segment  of  our society with a certain cohesion of itself,  and\r\n\r\nwith  the  individuals to be at the top of that  segment  to  be\r\n\r\nteachers,  to be principals, to be in the clans, to  be  in  the\r\n\r\nChambers  of Commerce, to be in the literary arena to write,  to\r\n\r\npaint,  to  put  on drama; I think that is something  extra  and\r\n\r\ndifferent.  If you do not like the word \"elite\", you think it is\r\n\r\nelitist, change it to something else - Top of the Pyramid, those\r\n\r\nwho are natural leaders of the community, if you will - but that\r\n\r\nis what we want to preserve and it goes beyond Chinese language,\r\n\r\nand it is a very important motivation for what we do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let me summarise in Mandarin, because I think the\r\n\r\npoints  which MPs have raised have already mainly been  met  and\r\n\r\nalso  because the MPs have been supportive and understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe purpose of this exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMembers who have spoken in support of the Government's policy on\r\n\r\nthe teaching of  Chinese language.  The response from the MPs is\r\n\r\nvery  encouraging.  Teaching and learning of Chinese is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant issue in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Before deciding on the changes, we  have  requested\r\n\r\nfor  and  received feedback from the various quarters.   I  have\r\n\r\npersonally spoken to the editors and journalists of the  Chinese\r\n\r\nnewspapers,   the  Chinese-educated MPs and  listened  to  their\r\n\r\nviews.   Admiral  Teo  has also spoken and  discussed  with  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Teachers' Union and their leaders on this issue.   They\r\n\r\nall  know  where the crux of the matter is, where  the  question\r\n\r\nlies, where the problem is.  Therefore, they also agree that  it\r\n\r\nis necessary to revise the contents of the Chinese curricula and\r\n\r\nour   policy  on  Chinese  language.   Of  course,  the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity  is very concerned about the adjustments to the  level\r\n\r\nof   Chinese   language  in  our  schools,  and   the   proposed\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the  CL `B' paper, and  the  impact,  possibly\r\n\r\nnegative  impact,  thereof.  This concern  is  valid  and  quite\r\n\r\nunderstandable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are making this adjustment to the level of Chinese language\r\n\r\nwith  two  objectives.  First, to nurture  a  group  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nelite, and secondly,  to provide all students, especially  those\r\n\r\nfrom the English-speaking families, a realistic level of Chinese\r\n\r\nfor them to study and pass the examination set at this level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bilingual education policy and the policy to learn\r\n\r\nmother tongue in schools will remain unchanged.  The main policy\r\n\r\nwill  remain  unchanged, but the details can  be  adjusted.   In\r\n\r\nimplementing  this  policy, we must do so in  keeping  with  the\r\n\r\nchanges  of  times  and circumstances.  We are a  multi-lingual,\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  and  multi-religious society.  A Chinese  cultural\r\n\r\nelite in this kind of a society has got a very important role to\r\n\r\nplay.   The  spirit,  the outlook in life  and  the  social  and\r\n\r\npolitical  values of the Chinese-educated and Chinese elite  are\r\n\r\ndifferent   from   those   of   the   English-educated.     But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  they complement one another.   For  example,  the\r\n\r\nChinese High School and RI are both excellent schools.  Yet, the\r\n\r\nstudents  they  produce  possess different  characteristics  and\r\n\r\ndispositions.  We will be so much poorer if we have one  without\r\n\r\nthe other, and it will be a great loss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in this regard, I agree with Dr Ker Sin Tze. We\r\n\r\nare not Japan.  We cannot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nuse  Japanese as our national language.  We are not Germany,  we\r\n\r\nare  not  France.  We are a multi-racial Singapore  situated  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia.   Our  working  language  is  English  and  our\r\n\r\ninternational environment is also quite westernised.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is  not an easy thing to nurture a group of Chinese cultural\r\n\r\nelite  here, but we are making efforts to make some  changes  to\r\n\r\nour  education  policy, and these are some of the  examples.   I\r\n\r\nthink  to  increase the number of SAP schools and through  other\r\n\r\nchanges  and  all  that I have announced, we can  have  positive\r\n\r\nresults.  I am confident of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot go back to the old ways of the 1950s and\r\n\r\n1960s.   The  Chinese schools then and the Chinese  elites  were\r\n\r\nproducts of certain historical circumstances.  At that  time  we\r\n\r\nwere a colony.  The Chinese students were anti-colonialism and a\r\n\r\nmainstay in the fight for independence.  Contributions from  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated in those days were relatively little.   Amongst\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese-educated students, some were communists, some  were\r\n\r\nnot.   After  the  merger with Malaysia, in  the  drive  against\r\n\r\ncommunalism, the Chinese community also played a very  important\r\n\r\nrole.   Because had the Chinese community bowed to the political\r\n\r\npressure then, Singapore would be finished.  But, now, that sort\r\n\r\nof  situation  has already passed us, it must therefore  be  put\r\n\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that even in China or Hong Kong or Taiwan, values\r\n\r\nand  traditions  do  not  remain unchanged.   So  under  certain\r\n\r\npolitical,  social  and  cultural conditions,  there  are  three\r\n\r\ndifferent   developments.    The  Chinese   in   Taiwan   become\r\n\r\n\"Taiwanised\", even the Mandarin they speak is contaminated  with\r\n\r\nthe  local  Taiwanese dialects.  In Hong Kong, you have  a  very\r\n\r\nstrong  local indigenous culture - the Cantonese culture with  a\r\n\r\nvery strong commercial flavour.   This was because Hong Kong was\r\n\r\na  colony, an economy but not a sovereign nation.   Now that  it\r\n\r\nhas become a Special Autonomy Region of China, it is also in the\r\n\r\nprocess of transformation.  China has been opening up after  the\r\n\r\ncultural revolution.  With the economic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreform  and open-door policy, their culture and values are  also\r\n\r\nevolving  and  changing.  Therefore, the  Chinese  elite  cannot\r\n\r\nremain  unchanged.   Our  Chinese elite  should  move  with  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of the Chinese culture and play an active  role  to\r\n\r\npromote  and  shape  Singapore into  a  metropolitan   city  and\r\n\r\neconomy in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mother tongue policy must be realistic with the standard\r\n\r\nlevel  of teaching and learning set at a level relevant  to  our\r\n\r\nstudents.   Because of the limitations to our human brains,  not\r\n\r\nmany   people  have  the  capability  to  master  two  languages\r\n\r\neffectively, just as our computer does not necessarily have  the\r\n\r\ncapability  to run every type of software, and if  you  overload\r\n\r\nit,  things  do not work out so well.  So this is a question  of\r\n\r\nbrain, not a question of mouth and jaw.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked what is the bottomline for our\r\n\r\nChinese  education.  He seems to imply that the  Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen  too accommodating and has fixed too low a bottomline.   My\r\n\r\nanswer is that our bottomline is one that is achieveable by  our\r\n\r\naverage  students with reasonable efforts in learning.  This  is\r\n\r\nour   bottomline.   We  all  have children.   Most  of  us  have\r\n\r\nchildren.   We all know there are children who may be strong  in\r\n\r\ncertain  subjects, and not so strong in some other subjects.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  children of Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang  are  also\r\n\r\nstudying in our schools.  But what are their results?  What kind\r\n\r\nof  problems do they face?  Can you keep on applying pressure on\r\n\r\nthem,  just like the way you  pump up the balloons?  Your  blood\r\n\r\npressure will rise too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our Members of Parliament learn through their own\r\n\r\npersonal  experiences that it is not easy for  our  children  to\r\n\r\nmaster both English and Chinese at the same time. Even those who\r\n\r\nwere  educated in Chinese and who speak Mandarin  at  home  also\r\n\r\ndiscover that the standard of Chinese of their children is lower\r\n\r\nthan  the good old days.  Mr Peh Chin Hua has expressed  regrets\r\n\r\nthat although his children have been doing well in their Chinese\r\n\r\nexaminations,  their standard was still not to his satisfaction.\r\n\r\nJust imagine, what will be the level of Chinese in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  at  the  time  of our grandchildren.   What  kind  of\r\n\r\nproblems  will  they face?  Although we have not  come  to  that\r\n\r\nstage, the time will come.  So we have to face this reality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the primary schools, I do not think there is much\r\n\r\nproblem.  But when you come to the secondary schools, it is more\r\n\r\ndifficult.  Let me tell you my personal experience.  I spent  13\r\n\r\nyears learning Chinese, six years in a primary school, six years\r\n\r\nin a secondary school, and one year in the Junior College.  They\r\n\r\nwere  all Chinese schools: Nanyang Primary School, Catholic High\r\n\r\nSchool  and National Junior College.  At home, I spoke  Mandarin\r\n\r\nto  my  father.   I  learned Chinese, and he was  also  learning\r\n\r\nChinese.  But when I reached the secondary school level, I began\r\n\r\nto  find it difficult.  For the primary school level, I  had  no\r\n\r\nproblem passing my Chinese examinations.  At the Secondary  Four\r\n\r\n`O' level examination, I worked very hard, but I managed only  a\r\n\r\nC4.   I was dissatisfied with myself.  I worked harder.  When  I\r\n\r\nwas in junior college, I had tuition and worked even harder. For\r\n\r\nthe  General Paper, known as Comprehension and Essay Writing,  I\r\n\r\nhad  only a 6.  Comprehension, no problem!  Essay writing, there\r\n\r\nwere problems.  In a Chinese school, a \"6\", almost failed!  If I\r\n\r\nhad  failed, there would be no scholarship for me.  Fortunately,\r\n\r\nI passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, one year, I went to NJC. I was not satisfied with\r\n\r\nmy  \"6\".  I wanted to improve my Chinese.  So I decided to  take\r\n\r\nChinese  as  a  principal subject, or \"A\" level.  For  principal\r\n\r\nlevel  Chinese, we had to learn classical Chinese (wen yen  wen)\r\n\r\nand Chinese literature.  After a few months, my teacher told me,\r\n\r\n\"Your  Chinese is not so good.  Your lines of thoughts expressed\r\n\r\nin  your  essays are very messy.\"  But I never had that kind  of\r\n\r\nproblem  with my English essay writing.  Why should I have  this\r\n\r\nproblem  when  I  wrote in Chinese?  It was not  a  question  of\r\n\r\ncontent,  but a question of language.  However, the content  and\r\n\r\nthe  language are closely linked because your brain has  only  a\r\n\r\nlimited  capacity. You are unable to express  the  idea  clearly\r\n\r\nbecause you are too handicapped in your command of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlanguage.  So after a few months, I gave up.  I did not take the\r\n\r\nprincipal Chinese paper in my `A' level examination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am convinced that learning Chinese is not an easy\r\n\r\ntask.   Even now, I read Lianhe Zaobao every day, and listen  to\r\n\r\nnews  over Channel 8 every night.   Yet, every time when I  want\r\n\r\nto make a major speech in Mandarin or to be interviewed, I would\r\n\r\nstill  have  to  spend  some time to  prepare  and  practise  in\r\n\r\nMandarin.  Otherwise, my expression, my sentences will  not  run\r\n\r\nsmoothly and fluently.  Expressions in English, and even English\r\n\r\ngrammar  will  seep in, even the words I utter  may  not  be  in\r\n\r\nEnglish.   So I think it is not an easy problem to solve.   Some\r\n\r\nstudents  are  learning their languages better  than  I  do.   I\r\n\r\nalways  admire  those  students who score distinctions  in  both\r\n\r\nlanguages,  because I failed to do it.  But  I  also  know  that\r\n\r\nthere  are many other students who are just like me, finding  it\r\n\r\ndifficult to learn Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our teachers have already known this as a fact. When I\r\n\r\nstudied  this problem, I asked some teachers, some  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  officials  to  introduce articles  from  the  ancient\r\n\r\nChinese  classics in the curriculum of Higher Chinese.   I  told\r\n\r\nthem  that  some of these Chinese classics were very  meaningful\r\n\r\nand  could  have great impact on the students. If we can  expose\r\n\r\nour   students  to  these  articles,  this  essence  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nliterature  will be of great benefit to them.  But the  teachers\r\n\r\ntold  me  that this was not realistic, not quite possible.   The\r\n\r\nsimple  reason is that the students may be taking Higher Chinese\r\n\r\nbut  if  you  want  them to study classical Chinese,  they  just\r\n\r\ncannot  cope  with  it.  In formulating the  curricula  for  our\r\n\r\nHigher Chinese, we face this restriction and constraint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we must fix the level of Chinese at an appropriate\r\n\r\nand  suitable level.  This level cannot be decided by our  likes\r\n\r\nor  dislikes.   It must go according to our experience  and  the\r\n\r\nlevel that is attainable by the students.  If we can incorporate\r\n\r\nadvanced  technology into our teaching methods, then  the  level\r\n\r\ncan  be  enhanced.  If you tell me that you want  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nstandard of teaching, improve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe quality of teachers without adjusting the difficult level of\r\n\r\nthe Chinese paper, I think it cannot be accepted.  We have tried\r\n\r\nto  improve the teaching method. Yes, we must do that, but it is\r\n\r\nnot the panacea to all our problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Chinese-educated Members of Parliament also show their\r\n\r\nconcerns about the curricula of the Chinese Language for EL  `B'\r\n\r\nin  that it should not be regarded as a \"soft option\".  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  their  views  and we will pay specific attention  to  this\r\n\r\naspect.   But with our past experience in handling the level  of\r\n\r\nChinese  teaching  and learning in Singapore, we  are  confident\r\n\r\nthat  the  situation  will  improve,  because  the  parents  are\r\n\r\nsupportive  of  the  idea  of their children  learning  Chinese,\r\n\r\nalbeit  some  may wish that the burden would not be  too  heavy.\r\n\r\nBut, as the Minister has mentioned, according to our guidelines,\r\n\r\nat  the  Primary 4 streaming, about 13% to 14% of the cohort  of\r\n\r\nstudents should qualify to take Higher Chinese.  But because  of\r\n\r\nthe  insistence of the parents, there are about  22%  of  ethnic\r\n\r\nChinese  students actually taking Higher Chinese,  and  most  of\r\n\r\nthem can cope with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents encourage the students to take EM1 because they believe\r\n\r\nthat  it  is better for their children to learn more.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nmost parents feel that their children are intelligent and should\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged  to  do EM1.  I think this is  some  good  social\r\n\r\npressure which is acceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our recent survey, 88% of parents feel that Chinese is an\r\n\r\nimportant subject.  Students may or may not like Chinese but 80%\r\n\r\nto  90% recognise that it is an important subject.  They may not\r\n\r\nknow  that they have to use Chinese to make big money in  China.\r\n\r\nBut  they  share the views of their parents, teachers,  and  the\r\n\r\nwhole  society.   So we must take Chinese.   If  we  do  not  do\r\n\r\nChinese  or  do  not do Chinese well, although you  may  not  be\r\n\r\ndenied  a place, you will feel a little uncomfortable or  rather\r\n\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do more than 90% of the parents endorse the values from the\r\n\r\nChinese\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nculture?   All these facts prove that the parents  know  that  a\r\n\r\nknowledge of Chinese is an important and helpful thing to  their\r\n\r\nchildren.   They  also know they want their  children  to  learn\r\n\r\nChinese.   They are using all kinds of methods to supervise  and\r\n\r\nencourage  their children to master the Chinese language.   They\r\n\r\nmay  engage  a  tuition  teacher,  even  two  or  three  tuition\r\n\r\nteachers,  to  coach  their  children.   Some  even  send  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to  Taiwan  or China for  \"immersion  courses\".   They\r\n\r\noffer  all kinds of incentives and rewards - score 90  marks  in\r\n\r\nyour  Chinese dictation, and I will buy you a Chinese  software.\r\n\r\nThey  use  all kinds of incentives, ways and means to  encourage\r\n\r\ntheir  children  to learn Chinese.  But if the pressure  is  too\r\n\r\ngreat,  I  think  the children's attitude may  change  or  their\r\n\r\nparents'  attitude may change.  Although they say they  support,\r\n\r\nthe  feasibility must be studied.  We cannot overlook or neglect\r\n\r\nthe feedback from such parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the changes that we are making to the Chinese curriculum\r\n\r\nwill  help  maintain our mother tongue education policy  in  the\r\n\r\never-changing  circumstances.  We must  frequently  discuss  and\r\n\r\nreview  our mother tongue policy.  This debate will not  be  the\r\n\r\nlast  one  in this House.  But so long as we continue to  adjust\r\n\r\nour   policy  according  to  objective  circumstances  and  make\r\n\r\nrealistic  approaches, we will be able to maintain  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nculture, Chinese traditions and Chinese values in us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, could I seek some\r\n\r\nclarifications from the Deputy Prime Minister?  According to DPM\r\n\r\nLee,  under  the new policy, the Government will allow  children\r\n\r\nfrom  an English speaking home who have encountered difficulties\r\n\r\nin coping with Chinese to opt for a new CL `B' paper. So long as\r\n\r\nthey  pass  the  Chinese paper at this level, it  will  be  good\r\n\r\nenough  and  they can carry on with their studies  in  a  junior\r\n\r\ncollege.    I  would  like to know whether the Government  would\r\n\r\nalso  consider  allowing those children  from  Chinese  speaking\r\n\r\nfamilies, and who encounter difficulties coping with English, to\r\n\r\nsit for an English\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npaper, such as EL `B', at a lower level so that they could  pass\r\n\r\nEnglish at a basic level and proceed to a junior college?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, actually the\r\n\r\nquestion  has  already been answered by the Minister  just  now.\r\n\r\nThe  answer is quite straightforward.  The Government  does  not\r\n\r\nhave any particular view on it. But, I believe it is the parents\r\n\r\nwho are more concerned with the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said, we do have a ME3 course where the\r\n\r\nstudents  can  take his mother tongue as the first language  and\r\n\r\nEnglish  as a second language.  We offer this option, but  there\r\n\r\nis  no  taker.  For students who cannot get through  the  normal\r\n\r\nstreaming,  then they can opt to to do ME3 - take mother  tongue\r\n\r\nas  the first language and English as a second language.  We let\r\n\r\nthe  parents  have a free choice.  However, it  has  been  eight\r\n\r\nyears  since 1991 when we introduced this option, and the number\r\n\r\nof  enrolment is still zero.  Nobody has enrolled for this  type\r\n\r\nof course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking for a realistic approach. What are the\r\n\r\nexpectations  of the parents?  What can we teach  the  students?\r\n\r\nIf  we put all these together, we would be able to settle on  an\r\n\r\nappropriate level.  This is an objective fact of life.   We have\r\n\r\nlooked at the quality of our students.  We know their abilities,\r\n\r\nwe  can  assess them and say that they can more or  less  attain\r\n\r\nthis  level.   We  are  not  taking the  weakest  student  as  a\r\n\r\nbenchmark.   We are looking at those students who  are  weak  in\r\n\r\nChinese but whose other academic results are not too bad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese is not the only second language subject our\r\n\r\nstudents  are  taking for their examinations. Some students  are\r\n\r\ndoing  German, French, Japanese and Malay as a second  or  third\r\n\r\nlanguage.   They have to reach a certain level of competence  to\r\n\r\npass  their examinations.   There must be a certain level  which\r\n\r\nis  attainable by them.  I feel that we would be able to  set  a\r\n\r\nlevel that is reasonably attainable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Perhaps the DPM did not\r\n\r\nquite  understand my question.  In the past, for Chinese  school\r\n\r\nstudents to go from Secondary 4 to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPre-University,  they  had to score  a  credit  in  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage,  otherwise  they  did not  even  qualify  for  a  full\r\n\r\ncertificate.  In those days, even the ordinary Chinese  language\r\n\r\npaper  was  of a much higher standard than the so-called  Higher\r\n\r\nChinese paper today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question was: what about those students who come from\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking families?  If their English is  no  good,  they\r\n\r\nare  disqualified from enrolment in a junior college.  Will  the\r\n\r\nGovernment also consider setting a English `B' paper  for  these\r\n\r\nstudents  to pass at a less demanding level for admission  to  a\r\n\r\njunior college?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If you have a junior\r\n\r\ncollege where all the subjects are taught in Chinese, then  such\r\n\r\na policy would be feasible.  But now, in all the junior colleges\r\n\r\nand  Pre-U  centres, the medium of instruction is  English.   If\r\n\r\nyour  English is no good, then it will be difficult for  you  to\r\n\r\ncope with the learning of the various subjects.  This is a basic\r\n\r\nprinciple that we must accept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it is fair or unfair to allow those who pass\r\n\r\ntheir  CL  `B' to go further in their studies, we must first  of\r\n\r\nall  understand that there is a price to pay for these students.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because the CL `B' result cannot be taken to calculate\r\n\r\ntheir aggregate.  This will affect their chances of getting into\r\n\r\nthe  more popular junior colleges because they lose one  subject\r\n\r\nfor  consideration.  Likewise, in the `A' level results, CL  `B'\r\n\r\nresult  cannot  be  included  in the  score  for  entry  to  the\r\n\r\nuniversity, and they may have difficulty getting places  in  the\r\n\r\nmore popular disciplines. We are giving some incentives and some\r\n\r\ndisincentives to discourage  the students from taking the CL `B'\r\n\r\nas a \"soft option\", or an easy way out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): However, I would like to\r\n\r\nseek   clarification  from  the  DPM.   According  to  him,   in\r\n\r\nprinciple, our language policy is such that the level of Chinese\r\n\r\ncan  be  lowered but the standard of English cannot be  lowered.\r\n\r\nIs that what he meant?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Our policy is that the\r\n\r\nlevel of any language\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  be  determined by the ability of our students.   Whether\r\n\r\nour standard of English language should be lowered or not, it is\r\n\r\nfor the parents to decide.  Do you want to lower the standard of\r\n\r\nEnglish  and  maintain the standard of Chinese  by  cutting  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  periods  and transferring them to the Chinese  periods?\r\n\r\nAlternatively,  should we offer a Chinese paper at  a  realistic\r\n\r\nlevel  to  alleviate the burden of those who have real  problems\r\n\r\nwith  their learning of Chinese?

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Probate and Administration Act\r\n\r\nand  the  Reciprocal  Enforcement of Foreign  Judgments  Act  to\r\n\r\nenable  Singapore  to  restore certain  reciprocal  arrangements\r\n\r\nwhich  existed between Singapore and Hong Kong before Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nbecame  a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic\r\n\r\nof China, thus ceasing to be part of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative approach employed to achieve this aim is\r\n\r\nsimilar to that employed in the Extradition (Amendment) Act 1998\r\n\r\nto  restore  the  pre-existing extradition arrangements  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Hong Kong.  Members may recall that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  approach  taken  was  to amend the definition  of  \"foreign\r\n\r\nState\" to include territories which are not states in their  own\r\n\r\nright.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first set of amendments concerns the Probate and\r\n\r\nAdministration  Act.   Section  46  currently  provides  that  a\r\n\r\nprobate  or letter of administration granted by a court anywhere\r\n\r\nin  the  Commonwealth can be re-sealed by our High Court.   Upon\r\n\r\nsuch re-sealing, the probate or letter of administration will be\r\n\r\nrecognised by our courts as having the same effect as if  it  is\r\n\r\ngranted  by  the  High  Court  in Singapore.   At  present,  the\r\n\r\nprocedure  of  re-sealing under section 46 is not available  for\r\n\r\nprobate  and  letters of administration granted in countries  or\r\n\r\nterritories outside the Commonwealth.  In other words, there  is\r\n\r\nno  provision  under our law for the recognition of  probate  or\r\n\r\nletters  of  administration granted in countries or  territories\r\n\r\noutside the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Bill proposes to do is to allow the re-sealing\r\n\r\nprocedure to be extended to any country or territory outside the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth.  This is done by allowing the Minister to declare,\r\n\r\nby  a notification in the Gazette, that the re-sealing procedure\r\n\r\nwill  apply  to  a particular country or territory  outside  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final amendment concerning the Probate and\r\n\r\nAdministration  Act  is the repeal of section  47.   Section  47\r\n\r\napplies  to  probate  and letters of administration  granted  in\r\n\r\nBritish  protectorates, which are not part of the  dominions  of\r\n\r\nthe  British Crown.  This provision is obsolete as there are  no\r\n\r\nsuch protectorates today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second set of amendments relates to the Reciprocal\r\n\r\nEnforcement of Foreign Judgments Act.  The Bill amends section\r\n\r\n2(1) by inserting definitions of \"country\" and \"foreign\r\n\r\ncountry\", to make clear that the term \"foreign country\" includes\r\n\r\na territory which is not a state in its own right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, for consistency, the Bill will also amend section\r\n\r\n31  of the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act by defining the\r\n\r\nterm  \"foreign  country\",  which is used  in  that  section,  to\r\n\r\ninclude any territory outside Singapore.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill, just like the Trade Marks Act, Geographical\r\n\r\nIndications  Act and Copyright (Amendment) Act  passed  by  this\r\n\r\nHouse last year, is a product of an Inter-Ministry Committee  on\r\n\r\nthe Implementation of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects\r\n\r\nof  Intellectual  Property Rights or the  TRIPS  Agreement,  for\r\n\r\nshort.   The  Committee has been reviewing  our  legislation  on\r\n\r\nintellectual  property  rights  (IPR)  to  give  effect  to  our\r\n\r\nobligations under the TRIPS Agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to fulfil Singapore's obligations under\r\n\r\nArticle  35  of  the  TRIPS  Agreement,  which  requires  member\r\n\r\ncountries  to  provide  protection  to  the  layout  designs  of\r\n\r\nintegrated  circuits in accordance with the  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nTreaty   on  Intellectual  Property  in  Respect  of  Integrated\r\n\r\nCircuits, 1989 (IPIC) and certain additional provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nTRIPS Agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, \"layout-designs of integrated circuits\" refers\r\n\r\nessentially to the 3-dimensional disposition of the elements and\r\n\r\ninterconnections making up an integrated circuit or \"IC\".  An IC\r\n\r\nis  an  electronic circuit in which the elements of the  circuit\r\n\r\nare  integrated  into  some  medium  and  function  as  a  unit.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  the  medium  used is a solid semiconductor,  usually\r\n\r\nsilicon.  The manufacturing technology allows the circuit to  be\r\n\r\nintegrated into a piece of silicon which is small and thin, like\r\n\r\na wafer, commonly called a \"chip\" or \"silicon chip\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of intellectual property right in ICs is an\r\n\r\nimportant step.  ICs have a growing market as they are  utilized\r\n\r\nin  many  products from watches to television to traffic  lights\r\n\r\nand  of  course  computers.  The design and  production  of  ICs\r\n\r\nrequire heavy investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now highlight the main provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill protects a layout-design that is original in the\r\n\r\nsense  that  it is the result of its creator's own  intellectual\r\n\r\neffort  and is not common place among creators of layout-designs\r\n\r\nand  manufacturers of integrated circuits at  the  time  of  its\r\n\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the owner of a protected layout-design has the right\r\n\r\nto   reproduce  it  and  to  commercially  exploit  it  and  any\r\n\r\nintegrated  circuit in which the layout-design is  incorporated.\r\n\r\nOthers may only do so with his consent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no requirement for registration or deposit of the\r\n\r\nlayout-design for the purposes of protection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides a range of defences to infringement\r\n\r\nproceedings which are common with other branches of intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty  law.  For example, the owner's right is not  infringed\r\n\r\nif  the  reproduction is done for a private purpose or  for  the\r\n\r\nsole purpose of evaluation, analysis, research or teaching.  The\r\n\r\nBill  also allows the use of an evaluation or analysis to create\r\n\r\na  different  layout-design that satisfies  the  requirement  of\r\n\r\noriginality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the position in other branches of our\r\n\r\nintellectual  property  law, parallel import  of  an  integrated\r\n\r\ncircuit  in which a layout-design is incorporated or an  article\r\n\r\nthat  contains  an integrated circuit in which the layout-design\r\n\r\nis incorporated would be allowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement and\r\n\r\nestablished practice in major WTO countries, the Bill allows the\r\n\r\nGovernment to use a layout-design without the permission of  the\r\n\r\nowner  for the defence or national security of Singapore, or  to\r\n\r\nassist in the exercise of powers and the implementation of civil\r\n\r\ndefence  measures during a state of emergency or state of  civil\r\n\r\ndefence emergency.  As is usually the case with such provisions,\r\n\r\nthe Bill requires the Government to pay appropriate compensation\r\n\r\nto  the owner for such usage.  This is the approach we have also\r\n\r\ntaken in the Copyright Act and Patents Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court is empowered to grant a compulsory licence for a\r\n\r\nperson  to reproduce or commercially exploit a layout-design  to\r\n\r\nremedy  an anti-competitive practice.  Such remuneration as  may\r\n\r\nbe  considered reasonable by the Court must be paid to the owner\r\n\r\nof the layout-design for such usage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layout-design would be protected for 10 years after the\r\n\r\nfirst  commercial exploitation, if the exploitation takes  place\r\n\r\nwithin  five years of its creation.  In other cases it would  be\r\n\r\nprotected for a maximum period of 15 years after its creation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of a layout-design may take proceedings and seek\r\n\r\nwhatever  remedy  by  way of damages, injunctions,  accounts  or\r\n\r\notherwise in regard to an infringement of his rights in a layout-design  as  are  available with respect to  any  other  property\r\n\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Assoc.

There were 5,700 such accidents in 1996, 5,600\r\n\r\nin 1997, and 5,200 for the period January to November 1998.  Our\r\n\r\nroads are generally safe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is due to the success of the two-pronged strategy of\r\n\r\npublic  education and strict enforcement adopted by the  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice (TP).   For many years now, TP has been organising annual\r\n\r\ncampaigns to educate motorists on road safety.

In\r\n\r\naddition,  Singapore driving licence holders who commit  serious\r\n\r\ntraffic offences can have their driving licence suspended by the\r\n\r\nDeputy   Commissioner  of  Police  (DCP)   pending   trial,   or\r\n\r\ndisqualified from driving by the Courts after conviction for the\r\n\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is not the issuing authority for foreign\r\n\r\ndriving  licences,  our  laws do not currently  empower  DCP  to\r\n\r\nsuspend  these licences nor the Courts to disqualify holders  of\r\n\r\nforeign  driving  licences from driving on our  roads.    It  is\r\n\r\ntimely  to rectify this anomaly because a significant number  of\r\n\r\nforeign  motorists  have  been  involved  in  fatal  and  injury\r\n\r\naccidents  on  Singapore  roads in recent  years.   Of  the  271\r\n\r\nmotorists  who  were  involved in fatal  accidents  in  January-November  last  year, 67, or 25%, of them were  foreigners.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  since 1994, roughly one in five motorists who were killed\r\n\r\non our roads were foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 will introduce a new section 47F to empower the\r\n\r\nCourt  and  DCP to prohibit holders of foreign driving  licences\r\n\r\nfrom driving on our roads if they accumulate a certain number of\r\n\r\ndemerit  points under DIPS to attract suspension by DCP,  or  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  convicted  or have committed  offences  in  the  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Act that attract suspension or disqualification.    The\r\n\r\npenalties  that  currently  apply to  a  motorist  convicted  of\r\n\r\ndriving   while  under  suspension  or  disqualification   shall\r\n\r\nsimilarly  apply  to  holders of foreign  driving  licences  who\r\n\r\nbreach the prohibition order.   For example, the penalty  for  a\r\n\r\nfirst-time  offender  who is convicted of  driving  while  under\r\n\r\nsuspension  is a fine of $5,000 or a jail term of one  year,  or\r\n\r\nboth.  Hence, a holder of a foreign driving licence who is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconvicted  for  the  first time for driving on  Singapore  roads\r\n\r\ndespite  being  prohibited from doing so would  face  a  similar\r\n\r\npenalty.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Motorists who cause death or serious injury through dangerous or reckless driving,  etc.</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, motorists who cause death or serious injury\r\n\r\nthrough  dangerous  or reckless driving, etc,  will  have  their\r\n\r\nlicence  suspended  once  they  have  been  charged  in   Court.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  under section 47C of the Road Traffic Act,  DCP  can\r\n\r\nsuspend the driving licence of a motorist once the motorist  has\r\n\r\nbeen  charged  in  Court for the offences of  causing  death  or\r\n\r\nserious  injury  while  driving under the influence  of  alcohol\r\n\r\nexceeding  the  prescribed  limit, a  drug  or  an  intoxicating\r\n\r\nsubstance,  or  without  insurance coverage.     The  suspension\r\n\r\nprevents the motorist from driving and endangering the lives  of\r\n\r\nother motorists and road-users, pending trial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, DCP is not empowered to do so for all other\r\n\r\noffences, no matter how serious they may be.  What this means is\r\n\r\nthat  until the Courts decide on the case, which may be up to  a\r\n\r\nfew months, the motorist can still drive if he wants to although\r\n\r\nhe  is  a  proven risk to other road users.   This situation  is\r\n\r\nclearly unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House may still recall the tragic accident\r\n\r\nthat  occurred  at Bendemeer Road in May last  year,  which  the\r\n\r\nCourt  dealt  with recently.    In that accident, a  sports  car\r\n\r\nploughed  into  a  crowded bus stop at Bendemeer  Road,  killing\r\n\r\nthree  women and injuring six others, some permanently disabled.\r\n\r\nThe  Court  has  sentenced the accused to two  years'  jail  and\r\n\r\ndisqualified him from driving all classes of vehicles for  life.\r\n\r\nBut it took six months for the case to be concluded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill seeks to amend section 47C to empower\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Commissioner of Police to suspend the driving licence\r\n\r\nof  a motorist once he has been charged in Court for any of  the\r\n\r\nfollowing offences:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Causing death to any person by dangerous or reckless driving\r\n\r\nunder section 66 of the Road Traffic Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Causing death to any person while committing a rash or\r\n\r\nnegligent act under section 304A of the Penal Code;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Causing serious injury to any person by dangerous or\r\n\r\nreckless driving under section 64 of the Road Traffic Act; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Causing serious injury to any person while committing a rash\r\n\r\nor  negligent act which endangers life under section 279 of  the\r\n\r\nPenal Code.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal will give the Traffic Police more flexibility in\r\n\r\ndealing  with motorists who threaten the safety and security  of\r\n\r\nother road users.   However, I would like to assure Members that\r\n\r\nthe  Traffic  Police will exercise these powers judiciously  and\r\n\r\nonly in clear-cut cases, like the Bendemeer Road case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Handphone driving offenders</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, making handphone driving a specific offence.\r\n\r\nHandphone   driving   offenders  are   currently   charged   for\r\n\r\ninconsiderate driving under section 65 of the Road Traffic  Act.\r\n\r\nFirst-time  offenders  are  usually offered  composition,  which\r\n\r\nattracts  a  fine  of  $170 and 9 demerit points.     Subsequent\r\n\r\noffenders are charged in Court and, if convicted, the Court  can\r\n\r\norder the forfeiture of their handphones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handphone drivers are a menace to other road-users as they\r\n\r\nare  less  likely to be able to control their vehicles properly.\r\n\r\nWith  handphones becoming very affordable today, the problem  of\r\n\r\nhandphone driving is likely to worsen unless we nip the  problem\r\n\r\nin  the bud.  The problem is clearly manifested in the number of\r\n\r\nsummonses  issued  by the Traffic Police for handphone  driving,\r\n\r\nwhich has surged from 400 in 1993 to 2,100 in 1997.   In January-November last year, 1,700 summonses were issued to motorists for\r\n\r\nhandphone driving.  Just imagine the number of handphone drivers\r\n\r\nwho have not been caught.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To signal the seriousness of the offence, clause 12 of the\r\n\r\nBill introduces a new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsection  65B  to  make  the act of using a  mobile  phone  while\r\n\r\ndriving  a specific offence in the Road Traffic Act.   The  Bill\r\n\r\ndefines \"use\" of handphone to mean holding it in one hand  while\r\n\r\nusing  it  to  communicate with any person.  The amendment  will\r\n\r\nalso  give  the Traffic Police greater flexibility to  vary  the\r\n\r\npenalties  for the offence of handphone driving to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthey are adequately deterrent.  The penalty for a first offender\r\n\r\nupon  conviction in Court is a fine of up to $1,000  or  a  jail\r\n\r\nterm  of up to six months, or both.  For a repeat offender,  the\r\n\r\npenalty  is a fine of up to $2,000 or a jail term of up  to  one\r\n\r\nyear,   or  both.   These  penalties  are  similar  to  existing\r\n\r\npenalties for inconsiderate driving.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Road bullies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, road bullies. Empowering the Court to disqualify\r\n\r\ndrivers  who are road bullies.  Road bullies were a major  cause\r\n\r\nof  public  concern in the late-eighties and early-nineties.  In\r\n\r\n1991,  for  example,  35 motorists were  charged  in  Court  for\r\n\r\ncausing hurt to fellow motorists.  Fortunately, a combination of\r\n\r\ntough Police enforcement and deterrent sentences handed down  by\r\n\r\nthe  Courts,  including  jail terms, have  helped  to  keep  the\r\n\r\nproblem  in  check.  But the problem still rears its  ugly  head\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to time.  In June last year, for example, a  trailer\r\n\r\ndriver  was  attacked with a screwdriver by  a  road  bully  and\r\n\r\nwarded  in  the hospital for two days for injuries to his  head,\r\n\r\nback  and neck because of a dispute over the right of way  along\r\n\r\nthe  East  Coast  Parkway.   The road bully  was  convicted  and\r\n\r\nsentenced to eight months' jail by the Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Courts are currently empowered to disqualify driving\r\n\r\nlicences   of   motorists  for  driving-related  offences,   eg,\r\n\r\ndangerous  driving,  but not for their conduct,  eg,  assaulting\r\n\r\nanother  driver or his passenger.  We are proposing  to  empower\r\n\r\nthe  Courts  to  disqualify drivers who are  road  bullies  from\r\n\r\nholding driving licences if they are convicted of various  Penal\r\n\r\nCode   offences,   including  voluntarily   causing   hurt   and\r\n\r\nvoluntarily  causing  grievous hurt to other  drivers  or  their\r\n\r\npassengers, arising from disputes over\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  a  road or public place, such as  road  accidents.\r\n\r\nClause 5 of the Bill seeks to amend section 42 to give effect to\r\n\r\nthis.   The period of the disqualification will be left  to  the\r\n\r\nCourt to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Proposals to reduce the number of motorists with outstanding warrants of arrest</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the amendments relating to the proposed\r\n\r\nmeasure  against motorists with outstanding warrants of  arrest.\r\n\r\nThere  were  54,000 outstanding warrants of arrest  relating  to\r\n\r\ntraffic and parking offences as at 30th November last year.  300\r\n\r\nmotorists had 10 or more outstanding warrants of arrest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrants of arrest are issued against persons who fail to\r\n\r\nturn up in Court when ordered to do so by the Courts.  We should\r\n\r\ntake  a serious view of such people because they basically  have\r\n\r\nno  regard  for  our  Courts.  On its part,  the  Police  mounts\r\n\r\nregular operations to arrest motorists with outstanding warrants\r\n\r\nof arrest, including paying house visits to their homes.  But it\r\n\r\nis  not  always  able  to  arrest  them  because  the  motorists\r\n\r\nconcerned may have either shifted homes or do not reside at  the\r\n\r\naddresses provided in the official records.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a motorist with an outstanding warrant of arrest\r\n\r\nrelating  to  an offence under the Road Traffic Act  or  Parking\r\n\r\nPlaces Act is allowed to renew his driving licence as soon as he\r\n\r\nhas  executed  his  warrant  of arrest.   Execution  here  means\r\n\r\nsurrendering  himself  to  a  Police  station  or  the   Warrant\r\n\r\nEnforcement Unit, and he is formally arrested.  But  during  the\r\n\r\nperiod  when the motorist is released on bail pending the  Court\r\n\r\nhearing,  some  jump bail and do not attend the scheduled  Court\r\n\r\nhearing,  thus  necessitating the issue of a  fresh  warrant  of\r\n\r\narrest.  This is a blatant abuse of the Court process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To curb such abuse, a motorist with outstanding warrants of\r\n\r\narrest  will  not be allowed to renew his driving licence  until\r\n\r\nthe Court has conclusively dealt with the case.  Firstly, clause\r\n\r\n3 of the Bill seeks to amend section 35(8) to empower the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDeputy  Commissioner of Police to refuse to  renew  the  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  of the motorist until after the offence has been  tried\r\n\r\nand  determined  by  the Court.  Secondly,  clause  6  seeks  to\r\n\r\nintroduce a new section 42A in the Road Traffic Act to give  the\r\n\r\nCourt the discretion to disqualify a motorist possessing a valid\r\n\r\ndriving  licence from driving if he has failed to  attend  Court\r\n\r\nafter  being arrested under a warrant and released on bail.   In\r\n\r\nthe case of a foreign driving licence holder, the Court will, in\r\n\r\nlieu  of  disqualification, issue a prohibition order under  the\r\n\r\nnew  section  47F  to  prohibit him from driving  on  our  roads\r\n\r\npending   the  determination  of  his  case.   The   period   of\r\n\r\ndisqualification  or  prohibition will be left  to  the  Court's\r\n\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other amendments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I come to other amendments. The Bill also\r\n\r\nproposes  a  number of other minor amendments.  For example,  to\r\n\r\naddress the Singapore Civil Defence Force's operational need for\r\n\r\nmore  drivers, especially heavy-vehicle drivers, clause 9  seeks\r\n\r\nto  amend section 49 of the Road Traffic Act to include SCDF, in\r\n\r\naddition  to  the  SAF,  as a competent  driving  authority  for\r\n\r\ncertifying  and  issuing  restricted  driving  licences  to  its\r\n\r\npersonnel  to drive vehicles owned by SCDF.  Clause  10  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  seeks  to amend section 62 so that the minimum  qualifying\r\n\r\nage  for driving licence holders of invalid carriages is  raised\r\n\r\nto  18  years  old,  similar to that  of  the  existing  minimum\r\n\r\nqualifying age for a motorcycle licence and a motorcar  licence.\r\n\r\nTo clarify the legal position for foreign motorists and visiting\r\n\r\nforces,  clause  4  of  the Bill seeks to  repeal  and  re-enact\r\n\r\nsection  38 to consolidate the laws relating to foreign  driving\r\n\r\nlicences and driving licences of members of the visiting forces.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will send a strong signal to all motorists\r\n\r\nthat  we do not condone bad driving habits and take a stern view\r\n\r\ntowards  irresponsible behaviour that puts the safety  of  other\r\n\r\nmotorists and road-users at risk.  The Traffic Police will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontinue  with its public education programmes and  messages  to\r\n\r\ndrive home the importance of road safety and safe driving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments cover two specific types of behaviour on the\r\n\r\nroads  - not just anti-social behaviour, but behaviour that  may\r\n\r\nendanger both life and limb, namely, \"road bullies\" and  drivers\r\n\r\nwho  use  mobile  phones without proper  hands-free  kits.   The\r\n\r\nlegislation in this regard is to be particularly welcome.   Road\r\n\r\nusers   must   be   protected  from   the   irresponsible,   the\r\n\r\ninconsiderate  and  the insensitive.  There are  several  points\r\n\r\nthat I would like to raise, not in objection to the legislation,\r\n\r\nbut to clarify the provisions and intention of the legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, road bullies - clause 5. This new provision is\r\n\r\ncomplicated.  It refers to several provisions in the Penal  Code\r\n\r\nregarding the causing of death, grievous hurt or hurt.  It  then\r\n\r\nprovides  that if a driver or a person in charge  of  a  vehicle\r\n\r\nwere to commit any of the offences referred to, in relation to a\r\n\r\ndispute  on  the  road, he may be disqualified  from  holding  a\r\n\r\nlicence, if the judge is of the view that \"it is undesirable for\r\n\r\nthe offender\" to drive a vehicle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the reference to only certain Penal Code offences.\r\n\r\nIt  is  quite likely that in a dispute between road  users,  the\r\n\r\nhurt  caused by one may be the result of provocation by another.\r\n\r\nThe  Penal Code provides for voluntary causing hurt and grievous\r\n\r\nhurt  due  to  provocation in sections 334 and 335 respectively.\r\n\r\nThese  provisions  which  allow for  lighter  punishments  where\r\n\r\nprovocation exists are not mentioned in the new section 42(1A).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to ask the Minister whether these provisions\r\n\r\nare  deliberately excluded from the amendments - so  that  those\r\n\r\nconvicted   under  these  sections  will  not  be   subject   to\r\n\r\ndisqualification of licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would support such exclusion. What I would not like to\r\n\r\nsee,  however, is a situation where the prosecutors  charge  the\r\n\r\ndrivers  under the sections mentioned in the amendment, but  not\r\n\r\nsections 334 and 335, even though the facts suggest the presence\r\n\r\nof  provocation.   This  may result in the  offender  getting  a\r\n\r\nheavier  sentence  and disqualification even  though  there  was\r\n\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I turn to the types of punishment. The technique\r\n\r\nadopted  to  control  traffic  offenders  are  fines,  terms  of\r\n\r\nimprisonment and/or disqualification.  That there must  be  such\r\n\r\ntypes of punishment, there can be no doubt.  But I would like to\r\n\r\nsay that we should look into alternative means of rehabilitating\r\n\r\nthe  offenders.   This  may include the requirement  to  undergo\r\n\r\nsocial  counselling, a course on road manners,  or  a  stint  in\r\n\r\ncommunity  service.   The  intention is  to  make  drivers  more\r\n\r\nsocially  conscious.   I  believe that many  Members  have  come\r\n\r\nacross in their Meet-the-People sessions, drivers who have been,\r\n\r\nor  are  facing, disqualification.  More often than  not,  these\r\n\r\ndrivers  are  the  sole breadwinners in fairly  large  families.\r\n\r\nDisqualification, even for a short period, directly affects  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the  family  in general.   Disqualification  should\r\n\r\ntherefore be used after all other means of educating the  errant\r\n\r\ndriver have failed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangerous driving: I turn next to clause 11 purporting to\r\n\r\namend  section  64  of the Act to allow for the  arrest  without\r\n\r\nwarrant  of drivers charged for \"reckless or dangerous driving\".\r\n\r\nMy  first  question is: why is there a need for  such  a  power?\r\n\r\nHave there been occasions where the offender on the road has  to\r\n\r\nbe  immediately apprehended?  How will officers be advised to be\r\n\r\ncautious  about  the  use  of this power  to  arrest  without  a\r\n\r\nwarrant?   Perhaps,  the  Minister can let  us  know  how  these\r\n\r\nmatters will be dealt with by the Police.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I believe it is unfortunate that the\r\n\r\nopportunity  has  not  been  taken  to  review  the  offence  of\r\n\r\n\"reckless  or  dangerous driving\".  The  language  defining  the\r\n\r\noffence  is  couched  widely  and very  much  dependent  on  the\r\n\r\nofficer's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperception of what constitutes driving that is \"dangerous to the\r\n\r\npublic\".   This  is always an unsatisfactory situation,  because\r\n\r\nviews  may differ from officer to officer, and drivers may  feel\r\n\r\ngenuine  grievance  in  being  charged  with  such  an  offence.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  if the Bill is passed today, the driver can be arrested\r\n\r\non  the  spot without a warrant.  I would like to appeal to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  consider  redefining  this  offence  at  the  next\r\n\r\navailable opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile phones: Clause 12 enacts a new section 65B that\r\n\r\nmakes it a specific offence to use a mobile phone while driving.\r\n\r\nThis is especially welcome.  Cases have been reported where  the\r\n\r\nuse   of   handphones  had  distracted  drivers,  resulting   in\r\n\r\naccidents, sometimes serious; sometimes fatal.  However, I  have\r\n\r\na  few  queries relating to the new provision that  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will address.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, car phones. Before the advent of the handphone or\r\n\r\nmobile  phone,  some cars may have car phones installed.   These\r\n\r\nphones  are  similar to desktop phones, that is, the driver  may\r\n\r\nstill  need  to  hold the handset to speak.  He  then  is  still\r\n\r\n\"using\"  the  phone,  as defined in the amendments.   Are  these\r\n\r\ntypes  of  car phones still in use, and, if so, are they  exempt\r\n\r\nfrom  the legislation?  The new definition of \"mobile telephone\"\r\n\r\nis certainly wide enough to cover this - is this intended?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the offence, as defined, is a \"moving offence\",\r\n\r\nthat is, no offence would be committed if the driver were to use\r\n\r\nhis  mobile phone at any time while the car is stationary,  such\r\n\r\nas  waiting at the junction for the lights to change.   Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  confirm  that  that  is  also  the  intention  of  the\r\n\r\nlegislation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, are persons convicted of using mobile phones under\r\n\r\nthis provision subject to disqualification of licence?  It would\r\n\r\nbe  good  if  such  an  option were present to  deter  offenders\r\n\r\nrepeating the offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, given the potential dangers of using handphones\r\n\r\nand being distracted by them in high-density populated areas\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  fast  expressways, and given the ubiquitous  nature  of  the\r\n\r\nhandphone  these days, is it not time to require car sellers  to\r\n\r\nensure that any car they supply should be provided with a mobile\r\n\r\nphone car kit?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments to the Road Traffic Act are\r\n\r\nimportant  measures  to  improve the safety  of  our  roads.   I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  speak in support of the amendments to the Road Traffic  Act.\r\n\r\nI  would  like, however, to express my views over  some  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed  amendments  and to indicate my concerns  over  certain\r\n\r\nareas of the new proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to section 35(8)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that this amendment is good. The amendment\r\n\r\nappears  to provide that the Deputy Commissioner may  refuse  to\r\n\r\nrenew  the  driving licence of a holder if the holder  has  been\r\n\r\narrested  under a warrant but before trial.  Unlike the existing\r\n\r\nsection  35(8),  the police need not execute the  warrant.   The\r\n\r\namended section 35(8) requires the warrant to be executed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to section 38. The old section 38 is limited to\r\n\r\nMalaysian  driving licences.  The amendment seems to  widen  its\r\n\r\nscope of application to any foreign driving licence or permit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 38(1) provides that a foreigner who holds a\r\n\r\nvalid  foreign licence is permitted to drive in Singapore during\r\n\r\na  period  of  12 months from the date of his last entry.   Sir,\r\n\r\nisn't  his  entry  into Singapore for any period  sufficient  to\r\n\r\npermit  him  to  drive  in  Singapore?   What  happens  if   the\r\n\r\nforeigner's  foreign driving licence has a  validity  period  of\r\n\r\nless  than  12  months?  Why must the section specify  that  the\r\n\r\nforeigner  be  temporarily  in Singapore?   How  do  you  define\r\n\r\n\"temporarily\"?  What happens if the stay of the foreigner is for\r\n\r\na period, such as 10 years?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 38(2) uses the words \"driving permit\"\r\n\r\ninstead  of  \"driving licence\" as in section 38(1).  It  appears\r\n\r\nthat  no  valid foreign driving licence is required as  long  as\r\n\r\nthere is a permit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to section 42</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the conviction under the aforesaid sections in\r\n\r\nthe  Penal Code is not sufficient.  One needs to prove that  the\r\n\r\ncommission of these offences has got to do with the use  of  the\r\n\r\nroad or public place and the behaviour of the offender. I am  of\r\n\r\nthe  view  that  this is a bit harsh, as this  appears  to  have\r\n\r\npunished  the  offender \"twice\", that is to say, the  punishment\r\n\r\nunder  the Penal Code as well as disqualification.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this is against natural justice.  Why should the  offender\r\n\r\nbe  deprived  of holding a driving licence?  By analogy,  is  it\r\n\r\nreasonable  to  prohibit any parent who commits  an  offence  of\r\n\r\npersecution of children from having children?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Insertion of new section 42A</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the existing section 42 empowers the court (and\r\n\r\nnot  the Public Prosecutor) to give an order of disqualification\r\n\r\nupon  conviction of the offender.  The new section 42A  proposes\r\n\r\nto give power to the Public Prosecutor to apply to the court for\r\n\r\nsuch  an  order  for disqualification when (a) the  offender  is\r\n\r\naccused (not convicted) of an offence and fails to appear before\r\n\r\nthe  court  to  answer the charge; (b) the court  has  issued  a\r\n\r\nwarrant  of  arrest; and (c) the offender has been arrested  and\r\n\r\nreleased  on  bail.  A further requirement is that  the  officer\r\n\r\nmust  inform  the offender that such application would  be  made\r\n\r\nagainst him if he stubbornly fails to appear before the court to\r\n\r\nanswer the charge on the next date fixed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that this new section 42A is also harsh\r\n\r\nespecially  in  a  case when the offence committed  is  a  minor\r\n\r\noffence.   When an offender is accused of any offence,  it  does\r\n\r\nnot  follow that he will certainly be convicted.  As long as the\r\n\r\noffender is not convicted, he is presumed to be innocent.   Sir,\r\n\r\nsection  42A  gives  me the impression that the  prosecution  is\r\n\r\nattempting  to  make use of such discretionary  power  (if  this\r\n\r\nsection is passed and becomes law) to apply for disqualification\r\n\r\nto  frighten, if not threaten, all offenders for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nensuring  their  appearance  before  the  court.   The   present\r\n\r\npractice is such that if the offender fails to appear before the\r\n\r\ncourt, a warrant of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narrest  will be issued.  If he is arrested, he will be  released\r\n\r\non  bail.   If he fails to appear again (ie, if he jumps  bail),\r\n\r\nthe  bailer will have to show cause.  If he does appear, he will\r\n\r\nbe  fined  for his early failure to appear.  I must  agree  that\r\n\r\nsuch  practice is not satisfactory to ensure appearance  by  the\r\n\r\noffender  but  it is more appropriate and fair to  the  offender\r\n\r\nbefore his conviction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to section 47C</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with this amendment as the offence is of a serious\r\n\r\nnature and would endanger other road users.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New section 65B</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the punishment provided in this new section 65B\r\n\r\nis  identical  to  section  65  (driving  without  due  care  or\r\n\r\nreasonable  consideration).  It is therefore crystal  clear,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  that this new section 65B is  inserted  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of covering the use of mobile telephone.  I believe  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Law had previously indicated that  there  was  no\r\n\r\nnecessity  to have a specific provision to cover use  of  mobile\r\n\r\ntelephone,  as  section  65  is  sufficient  to  cover  such   a\r\n\r\nsituation.    The   proposed  insertion  would   now   therefore\r\n\r\ncontradict what the Minister had argued before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am of the view that section 65B is not necessary and\r\n\r\nI  agree  that section 65 does cover wider situations than  just\r\n\r\nuse  of mobile phone.  My experience as a driver is that  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  dangerous,  while driving, to look at the  pager  when  it\r\n\r\nsounds, to use a walkie-talkie, to meddle with the audio  system\r\n\r\nor  to  watch  television  (which some  motor  car  owners  have\r\n\r\ninstalled).   Section  65 covers all such situations.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  new section 65B is of limited application and the insertion\r\n\r\nof which is to lengthen the Act unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this new section 65B is to be inserted, then one must\r\n\r\nask  whether this section covers the use of walkie-talkies.   If\r\n\r\nthe  answer is in the negative (which seems to be unclear as the\r\n\r\ndefinition of mobile telephone includes any hand held equipment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  is designed and capable for tele-communication) or  it  is\r\n\r\ncovered by section 65, then why should one insert section 65B?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the definition of \"use\" is also ambiguous. When one\r\n\r\nuses the mobile phone while driving, whether one is holding  the\r\n\r\nphone  with  one hand (sounds like holding with one hand  is  an\r\n\r\noffence while holding with two hands is not!) or using a  hands-free car kit, it is equally dangerous as one's mind would be pre-occupied  in conversation.  Furthermore, a driver may  sometimes\r\n\r\nhold  and  dial the mobile phone before it is connected  and  in\r\n\r\nsuch a case, would he be caught for using the mobile phone?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this new section 65B is not necessary and\r\n\r\nthe definitions are ambiguous and not satisfactorily drafted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak  in support of the Bill and appreciate the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexpress my comments and thoughts on three issues which I feel we\r\n\r\nshould take the opportunity which this Bill presents to address.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in considering the proposed amendments to the Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Act, I think we should bear in mind the most  important\r\n\r\nobjective  of  such regulations, which is the  deterrent  effect\r\n\r\nthey  have  to prevent the offences they create.  Not only  must\r\n\r\nthe  laws  be clear as to what is prohibited on our  roads,  the\r\n\r\npenalties which they impose must reflect the seriousness of  the\r\n\r\nparticular  offences in question and be sufficiently  severe  to\r\n\r\ndeter  people  from committing the offences in the first  place.\r\n\r\nAfter all, what is at stake here are the lives of all the people\r\n\r\nwho  use  our roads daily, whether as motorists, pedestrians  or\r\n\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point relates to clause 7 of the Bill where it is\r\n\r\nproposed that section 47C of the principal Act be amended to add\r\n\r\nto  the  circumstances  under which the Deputy  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPolice  may immediately suspend the driving licence of a  person\r\n\r\nwho has caused death or serious injury to another person while\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndriving.   I  would  like  to  ask the  Minister  whether  other\r\n\r\noffences   which   provide   mandatory   disqualification   upon\r\n\r\nconviction  by the court should also be covered.  Such  offences\r\n\r\ninclude  reckless or dangerous driving and illegal racing  under\r\n\r\nsections 64 and 116, respectively of the Road Traffic Act, theft\r\n\r\nof  a motor vehicle or component parts under section 379A of the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code, and driving and being in charge of a motor  vehicle\r\n\r\nwhilst  under the influence of drink or drug under  sections  67\r\n\r\nand 68 respectively of the Road Traffic Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, please allow me to elaborate on the drink-related\r\n\r\noffences I last mentioned.  The problem of drink driving  is  of\r\n\r\nconcern  in  Singapore  because of the growing  number  of  such\r\n\r\ncases,  especially  during the festive periods,  which  led  the\r\n\r\nauthorities to launch the Anti-Drink Drive campaign in  December\r\n\r\nlast  year.   The Straits Times on 12th December  1998  reported\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  first 10 months of last year, 493 motorists  were\r\n\r\nconvicted  of  drink driving and all of them  were  disqualified\r\n\r\nfrom  driving by the court.  It was also reported that  on  17th\r\n\r\nDecember  1998, 23 persons were charged and convicted  in  court\r\n\r\nfor  drink  driving offences and all were given sentences  which\r\n\r\nincluded jail terms and driving bans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the years, the law relating to drink driving has been\r\n\r\nprogressively enhanced and penalties for drink related  offences\r\n\r\nmade  heavier  and heavier by previous amendments  to  the  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Act.  I agree with this approach.  The public has  been\r\n\r\ncontinually  warned  of  the effects and consequences  of  drink\r\n\r\ndriving.  But the increased incidence of drink driving indicates\r\n\r\nthat  the  problem is rooted more in the irresponsible attitudes\r\n\r\nof  people rather than in ignorance.  Since drunkenness is self-induced,  drink  driving is therefore totally preventable.   Our\r\n\r\nlaws should therefore have a strong deterrent effect on would-be\r\n\r\noffenders  who risk their own lives and the lives of  others  by\r\n\r\ndrinking and driving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as it now stands, the Road Traffic Act provides that\r\n\r\nany person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvehicle on a road or other public place, has so much alcohol  in\r\n\r\nhis  body  that the proportion of it exceeds 35 microgrammes  in\r\n\r\n100  mls  of  breath or 80 minigrammes in 100 mls  of  blood  is\r\n\r\nguilty of an offence regardless of whether he is in fact fit  to\r\n\r\ndrive  or  capable of having proper control of his vehicle.   On\r\n\r\nconviction, unless the court, for special reasons, thinks fit to\r\n\r\norder otherwise, the offender shall be disqualified from holding\r\n\r\nor  obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than 12\r\n\r\nmonths.  What this means to the layman is that once he is caught\r\n\r\nwith  alcohol in his body exceeding the prescribed limit, it  is\r\n\r\nalmost  without  doubt and without exception  that  he  will  be\r\n\r\ndisqualified by the court.  However, only when death or  serious\r\n\r\ninjury  results may his driving licence be immediately suspended\r\n\r\nfrom  the time he is charged with the offence until the  offence\r\n\r\nis  tried  and determined in court.  When no death or injury  is\r\n\r\ncaused,  there is no provision for immediate suspension  of  the\r\n\r\naccused's driving licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister whether he would\r\n\r\nconsider imposing immediate suspension in drink driving cases by\r\n\r\nincluding  this  as an additional category of  offences  in  the\r\n\r\nproposed  section 47C(1A) of the Road Traffic Act.   To  me,  if\r\n\r\ndrink  driving is so serious and so undesirable, the ingredients\r\n\r\nand  test  for the offence strictly and objectively applied  and\r\n\r\nthe  sentence of mandatory disqualification is certain, then why\r\n\r\nwait until the offender is charged in court and convicted before\r\n\r\ntaking  him  off the roads?  This would help to drive  home  the\r\n\r\nseriousness  of  this offence, making it clear to  every  driver\r\n\r\nthat  every time he drives while under the influence of alcohol,\r\n\r\nhe  is  endangering his own life and the lives of others and  it\r\n\r\nshould  not  make a difference whether any injury or  death  has\r\n\r\nbeen caused by his irresponsible behaviour.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>7.12 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I would like to raise relates to the\r\n\r\nproposed section 65B as set out in clause 12 of the Bill.   This\r\n\r\nnew\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsection  deals  with  the  use of mobile  telephones  and  other\r\n\r\ntelecommunications equipment by motorists while on the road.  In\r\n\r\nrecent  years, the mobile telephone has become quite  ubiquitous\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   For many people on the move, it has  become  an\r\n\r\nindispensable  tool  in their busy schedules.   As  the  use  of\r\n\r\nmobile telephones becomes more and more common and widespread, I\r\n\r\nsupport the urgent need to have express laws on their use  while\r\n\r\ndriving  on  the road.  It is also important that the  laws  are\r\n\r\nclear  and leave no room for doubt or argument as to what manner\r\n\r\nof  use  is prohibited as many people will be affected by  these\r\n\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the proposed section 65B, I am afraid it is less\r\n\r\nthan  clear as to the meaning of the word \"use\" in its  context.\r\n\r\nThe  word  \"use\"  has  been defined to mean  \"holding  a  mobile\r\n\r\ntelephone  in  one hand while using it to communicate  with  any\r\n\r\nperson\".  This definition appears to be too restrictive  as  the\r\n\r\nordinary  meaning  of the word \"communicate\" in  English  is  to\r\n\r\nspeak  to another person.  Does this cover situations where  the\r\n\r\nmotorist  is  in the process of punching in the numbers  on  the\r\n\r\nkeypad, or when he is holding the phone to his ear while waiting\r\n\r\nfor  his  call to be answered by the other side, or when  he  is\r\n\r\ndoing  some  mobile banking, or accessing his SingTel voicemail?\r\n\r\nBut  clearly, all these situations are just as dangerous as  the\r\n\r\ndriver  has  to steer with one hand, hold his telephone  in  the\r\n\r\nother and take his eyes and concentration away from the road  in\r\n\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I would like to make is that offenders may have\r\n\r\nall  sorts  of  excuses to show that they were not communicating\r\n\r\nwith anyone at that point in time when they were stopped by  the\r\n\r\npoliceman.   Further, it may be difficult for the prosecutor  to\r\n\r\nprove  that  the mobile telephone was actually  in  use  at  the\r\n\r\nmaterial time.  Can the records of the mobile telephone operator\r\n\r\nbe  produced  in court as evidence?  But what if the  operator's\r\n\r\nrecords  show that the phone was not in use at the alleged  time\r\n\r\nof  the  offence  as recorded by the traffic policeman's  watch?\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  this  section should be worded to allow our  policemen\r\n\r\nsome judgment in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\napprehending motorists who appear to be or are in the process of\r\n\r\nusing the mobile phone while the vehicle is in motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lastly I would like to express my sadness when what\r\n\r\nshould have been ordinary road courtesy and manners find its way\r\n\r\ninto  our  legislation.  I refer to road rage or road bully  and\r\n\r\nclause  5  of  this Bill which seeks to enhance the penalty  and\r\n\r\nempower  the  Court  to  disqualify a  person  if  he  has  been\r\n\r\nconvicted of any specified offence which arises from or which is\r\n\r\nconnected with a dispute between him and another person over the\r\n\r\nuse  of  the road or public place.  So, a dispute over a parking\r\n\r\nlot could result in the aggressor being banned from driving.   I\r\n\r\nfeel one thing that has to be emphasised most strongly, even  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  aspires  towards having a world-class  transportation\r\n\r\nsystem, is the importance of inculcating good road habits in all\r\n\r\nroad  users  here.   Besides  having  the  appropriate  laws  to\r\n\r\nregulate  the  use  of  our roads, we  should  also  stress  the\r\n\r\nimportance of being courteous and considerate to our fellow road\r\n\r\nusers.   There  is  no  point  having  the  most  efficient  and\r\n\r\nimpressive  transportation system if it is  not  also  safe  and\r\n\r\npleasant to use.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ntoo rise to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Ong Kian Min said earlier, the primary purpose of any\r\n\r\nlegislation  is to serve as a deterrent to prevent the  offences\r\n\r\nfrom  being  repeated.  The Minister had said earlier  that  the\r\n\r\npassage of this Bill will send a clear and loud message  to  all\r\n\r\nthose  would be offenders of our roads.  And I believe  in  many\r\n\r\naspects,  he  is right, except in one particular  area  where  I\r\n\r\nthought  he  would have taken this opportunity  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\npenalty  for such offences, and that is in the area  of  causing\r\n\r\ndeath   through  reckless  and  dangerous  driving.    He   also\r\n\r\nhighlighted  the case where a motorist ploughed through  a  bus-stop,  killing three persons and seriously injuring  others  and\r\n\r\nthe   penalty  for  that  particular  offence  was  two   years'\r\n\r\nimprisonment and suspension\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof driving licence for life.  I have given it some thought and I\r\n\r\nhave  also  discussed  it  with my grassroots  leaders  and  the\r\n\r\nconsensus  is that the penalty in this particular  case  is  not\r\n\r\nsevere  enough.  This case is over, and I think it is all  right\r\n\r\nfor me to bring it up in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, where other minor offences attract heavier\r\n\r\npenalty,  I  believe that the current penalty in this particular\r\n\r\ncategory  is  insufficient.  For instance, if  the  penalty  for\r\n\r\noutraging of modesty or rape would attract long imprisonment and\r\n\r\nsevere punishment through caning, I wonder why a case of causing\r\n\r\ndeath   through  dangerous  driving  attracts  only  two  years'\r\n\r\nimprisonment  and  suspension of driving licence  for  life.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that we should enhance the penalty in these  areas  and\r\n\r\nprobably  I  would even advocate the introduction of caning  for\r\n\r\nsuch  offences.   This might not be the right occasion  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to address these problems but I hope he will give  his\r\n\r\ndue  consideration and bring up such issues in future amendments\r\n\r\nto the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for speaking in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill.  Let me try to deal with the points  raised\r\n\r\nby each of the Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof Chin asked why did we deliberately exclude sections\r\n\r\n334 and 335 of the Penal Code from the amendments.  Yes, we have\r\n\r\nindeed  deliberately excluded sections 334 and 335 of the  Penal\r\n\r\nCode  as these relate to offences committed on provocation.   In\r\n\r\nthe  situation where a motorist reacts to provocation, depending\r\n\r\non  the circumstances of the case, he may not necessarily  be  a\r\n\r\nroad  bully.  Nevertheless, he would be punished under the Penal\r\n\r\nCode  for  his actions.  As the amendment is meant to deal  with\r\n\r\nroad  bullies, the Bill therefore has made a distinction between\r\n\r\nthe cases which involve provocation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of other kinds of help and rehabilitation\r\n\r\nof offenders and suggestions of social counselling and so on,  I\r\n\r\nthink  all  Members agree that motorists who flout  our  traffic\r\n\r\nlaws should be penalised so that they realise the seriousness of\r\n\r\nthe offences which they commit.  However, for some of the less\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nserious  traffic offences, I agree that there may  be  scope  to\r\n\r\nconsider  other  forms  of  censure or  punishment  which  could\r\n\r\ncomplement the existing forms of penalties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we know that offenders who are liable for\r\n\r\nsuspension  for  their first or second time  are  already  being\r\n\r\ngiven the chance to attend the one-day retraining course.   This\r\n\r\ncourse consists of defensive driving skills, inculcation of good\r\n\r\ndriving habits and so on.  A remission of the suspension  period\r\n\r\nwill be granted if the motorist passes the course.  I will study\r\n\r\nwhether  it is appropriate to adopt other measures suggested  by\r\n\r\nProf   Chin,   for  example,  community  service  or  compulsory\r\n\r\ncounselling for certain groups of traffic offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On dangerous driving and why we arrest people without a\r\n\r\nwarrant,  dangerous and reckless driving is a  serious  offence.\r\n\r\nIt  carries  24 demerit points on conviction.  It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nimperative that the Police has the powers to immediately  detain\r\n\r\nthe offender, investigate the case and then produce the offender\r\n\r\nin Court as soon as possible.  But if we were to take the normal\r\n\r\ncourse  of  events like now, it will take up to a few  weeks  to\r\n\r\nhave  the offender produced in Court by way of Notice to  Attend\r\n\r\nCourt.   So  this  proposed amendment is meant  to  empower  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police  to  deal with such drivers in  a  decisive  and\r\n\r\nexpeditious  manner  so that they cannot  further  endanger  the\r\n\r\nlives  of  other road users.  The Police will use  these  powers\r\n\r\njudiciously.   They have administered section  64  of  the  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Act  for many years and they know from  experience  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances under which an offence is classified as  dangerous\r\n\r\ndriving  or reckless driving, rash driving or negligent driving.\r\n\r\nThey  will use their years of experience to classify these cases\r\n\r\nand deal with the case accordingly before the person is arrested\r\n\r\nfor dangerous driving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of car phones and whether car phones which\r\n\r\nwere already installed in the cars in the past are still in use,\r\n\r\nyes,  they  are  still in use.  Drivers who use the  car  phones\r\n\r\nwithout the hands-free kits while driving would be committing an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noffence.  The proposed amendment is meant to cover all kinds  of\r\n\r\nhand-held communication equipment.  So walkie-talkie would  also\r\n\r\nbe  counted  as a communication device.  The driver is  said  to\r\n\r\nhave committed an offence if he holds it in one hand and uses it\r\n\r\nto  communicate with another person.  If people would do what Dr\r\n\r\nLily Neo thinks that holding it with two hands, and they are not\r\n\r\ncommitting an offence, I would suggest that they try it and they\r\n\r\nwill  see  whether they will be committing an  offence  or  not.\r\n\r\nThey  will  be  committing an offence, maybe not  for  handphone\r\n\r\ndriving  but for dangerous driving which will carry a much  more\r\n\r\nserious punishment.  So do not try it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the question of whether it is an offence when a\r\n\r\nperson uses the phone when the vehicle is stationary or when  he\r\n\r\nstops  at  a traffic junction, and when he moves off,  he  stops\r\n\r\ncommunicating.   There  is no offence if  the  driver  uses  his\r\n\r\nmobile  phone  without the hands-free kit while the  vehicle  is\r\n\r\nstationary,  including while waiting at  the  junction  for  the\r\n\r\nlights  to  change, as long as the driver stops using the  phone\r\n\r\nimmediately  when he moves his vehicle.  The proposed  amendment\r\n\r\nmakes   it  an  offence  to  hold  on  to  a  communication   or\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  device and communicate  with  another  person\r\n\r\nonly  when the vehicle is in motion.  So when the motorist calls\r\n\r\non the mobile phone and listens to a voice-mail, he is \"talking\"\r\n\r\nto that person, and he will be committing an offence.  Again, do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that he can get away by just talking to a voice-mail\r\n\r\nand  that  he is not talking to another person.  It  must  be  a\r\n\r\nperson who left the voice-mail.  The motorist should concentrate\r\n\r\non  driving and controlling his vehicle and looking at the  road\r\n\r\nand traffic situation when the vehicle is moving.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould advise motorists in general not to use the phone unless it\r\n\r\nis  absolutely necessary and if they have to use it,  do  use  a\r\n\r\nhands-free kit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof Chin also asked whether persons who are convicted of\r\n\r\nusing   mobile  phones  under  the  provision  are  subject   to\r\n\r\ndisqualification  of the licence.  Persons convicted  under  the\r\n\r\nnew provision would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot be liable to mandatory disqualification.  However, the Court\r\n\r\nhas  a  discretionary power under section 42 of the Road Traffic\r\n\r\nAct  to disqualify any offender of any traffic offence which  it\r\n\r\nconsiders serious enough.  If the Court thinks that it  is  very\r\n\r\nserious, the Court may order a disqualification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof Chin also asked whether in densely populated areas and\r\n\r\nexpressways  and  so on, we should not require  car  sellers  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  their cars which they sell should have  hands-free\r\n\r\nmobile  phones.   I think we will leave it to  the  car  sellers\r\n\r\nbecause not all motorists want to have a car phone.  So fixing a\r\n\r\ncar  phone and charging motorists may not be a fair thing to do.\r\n\r\nWe  will leave it to the market to decide.  Although the use  of\r\n\r\nhands-free  kits  for  driving is not an  offence,  the  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice would want to encourage people to refrain from using  the\r\n\r\nhands-free kits as far as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to Dr Lily Neo's comments. She said that\r\n\r\nthe  old section 38 is confined only to Malaysians.  Yes, indeed\r\n\r\nit  is.    Singapore  is  a  signatory  to  the  United  Nations\r\n\r\nConference  on  Road  and  Motor Transport  Convention  on  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic,  1949, and as an contracting state to this  Convention,\r\n\r\nwe have to recognise the driving permits or licences.  They mean\r\n\r\nthe  same thing; some countries call it a permit, some countries\r\n\r\ncall  it  a  licence, so there is no confusion here.   They  are\r\n\r\nissued  by  contracting parties for a period of up to  one  year\r\n\r\nwithout requiring the motorist to sit for any driving test.  The\r\n\r\nRoad  Traffic  Act  did not formally recognise  the  obligations\r\n\r\nunder  the  Convention  in  the past.   But  this  amendment  is\r\n\r\nnecessary now to formally state Singapore's recognition  of  the\r\n\r\nforeign  driving  licences  or driving  permits  issued  by  the\r\n\r\nsignatory states.  As the recognition of driving licence is  for\r\n\r\na  period of only one year, a foreigner staying in Singapore for\r\n\r\nmore  than  one  year is required to obtain a Singapore  driving\r\n\r\nlicence.  However, if the driving licence is valid for a  period\r\n\r\nof  less  than one year, then the driving licence would only  be\r\n\r\nrecognised for the period of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvalidity of the foreign driving licence.  Foreigners who wish to\r\n\r\nremain here and drive for more than a year should convert  to  a\r\n\r\nSingapore driving licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of section 42 on road bullies, this section\r\n\r\nis  targeted  at  motorists  who  show  violent  behaviour  when\r\n\r\nreacting  to  situations connected to driving.  As a  result  of\r\n\r\nsituations  such  as  flashing of  head  lamps,  overtaking  and\r\n\r\ndisputes over parking spaces, motorists have been known to cause\r\n\r\nserious injury to other persons.  Innocent road users should not\r\n\r\nbe  subjected  to the potential danger posed by such  motorists.\r\n\r\nHence, those who exhibit such violent behaviour when reacting to\r\n\r\nsituations arising from the use of the road and choose  to  take\r\n\r\nthe  law into their own hands should be penalised for the errant\r\n\r\nact.   There is no question of double penalty.  It is just  part\r\n\r\nof  the  penalty imposed by the Court.  For example, in many  of\r\n\r\nour offences, we say that the Court can impose a fine, a jail or\r\n\r\nboth.  By fining the person and jailing him at the same time, we\r\n\r\nare not saying that the Court is punishing him twice.  It is the\r\n\r\nsame   punishment.    Now  we  just  add  another   one   called\r\n\r\n\"disqualification\".  If one commits certain offences of the Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Act,  one can also be subject to disqualification.   So\r\n\r\nthere is no double punishment as such.  The analogy of Dr Neo is\r\n\r\nthat a mother or parent convicted of abusing the - I believe  it\r\n\r\nis not persecuting but abusing the child - means that the parent\r\n\r\ncannot have children.  I think that is not the correct analogy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whether it is too harsh under section 42A to disqualify\r\n\r\na  person for failure to turn up in Court, I think we have tried\r\n\r\nvery hard to get these people with warrants of arrest to turn up\r\n\r\nin  Court.  I think the patience of the Warrant Enforcement Unit\r\n\r\nand  the  Police as well as the Court is wearing  thin.   People\r\n\r\njust  ignore  warrants of arrest.  There are  more  than  55,000\r\n\r\nwarrants of arrest outstanding and there are hundreds of  people\r\n\r\nwith  10 or more warrants of arrest in their names.  So, we have\r\n\r\nto  take a very serious view of people who totally disregard the\r\n\r\nlaw of Singapore and show contempt of the Court when ordered  by\r\n\r\nthe Court to turn up and they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndid  not  turn  up.  We will have to deal with such  people  who\r\n\r\nsimply refuse to turn up in Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an offender executes a warrant of arrest, that is,\r\n\r\nwhen  he surrenders to the Traffic Police or goes to the Warrant\r\n\r\nEnforcement Unit, the Police would inform him that if  he  fails\r\n\r\nto  turn  up  in  Court at the hearing date, then  an  order  of\r\n\r\ndisqualification may be preferred against him.  In other  words,\r\n\r\na  warning  will be given to that motorist to turn up  in  Court\r\n\r\nbecause  failure to turn up in Court means that  an  application\r\n\r\nwill  be  made to the Court to disqualify the driver.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is fair.  If not, people would just take for granted  that\r\n\r\nany  notice to attend court can simply be ignored.  I think that\r\n\r\nis  not a good healthy thing to encourage in Singapore.  This is\r\n\r\nnot  meant  to  be punitive but to be preventive so  that  these\r\n\r\npeople  do  not  waste the court's time, the police's  time  and\r\n\r\neverybody else's time in trying to chase after them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also asked that since section 65 already can\r\n\r\ntake  care of handphone driving, why do we need section  65B  to\r\n\r\nmake  it a specific offence.  We want to have a specific offence\r\n\r\nfor  handphone driving so as to provide more flexibility to  the\r\n\r\nTraffic Police in dealing with handphone driving.  If we do  not\r\n\r\ndo  that, they will find that of all the offences under  section\r\n\r\n65,  only one of them, for example, handphone driving,  is  very\r\n\r\nserious,  and  if  they want to enhance the punishment  for  the\r\n\r\noffence by increasing the demerit points and imposing the  fine,\r\n\r\nthey will have to increase it for all the offences under section\r\n\r\n65.    We  think  we  do  not have to take  such  a  blunderbuss\r\n\r\napproach.   It  is better that we create a distinct  offence  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  police  will  have greater flexibility  to  vary  the\r\n\r\ncomposition  fine and the demerit points and to take  any  other\r\n\r\naction  or  measure against the offender without  affecting  the\r\n\r\nother  motorists  who  commit offences under  the  more  general\r\n\r\nprovision of section 65 of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have talked earlier about a handphone driver trying to\r\n\r\ndrive  with  both  hands holding his handphone and  leaving  the\r\n\r\nsteering wheel free.  If he does so, he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  be  committing a more serious offence, and that is  called\r\n\r\ndangerous driving.  Dangerous driving is punishable with a  fine\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding $3,000 or imprisonment up to 12 months, or  both,\r\n\r\nfor  a first offence.  For a second and subsequent offence,  the\r\n\r\nperson would be liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or  to  an\r\n\r\nimprisonment term not exceeding two years, or both.  So this  is\r\n\r\nmore  serious than just a handphone driving offence.  So do  not\r\n\r\nattempt to drive with both hands on the handphone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to Mr Ong Kian Min's questions. His main point\r\n\r\nis  really  to impose an immediate suspension on those  who  are\r\n\r\nfound  or  suspected to have alcohol beyond  the  limit  in  his\r\n\r\nblood.   I  would  ask  the police to look  into  this  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  we may do as he suggests.   But I think we  have  to\r\n\r\ntake the measures one step at a time and we will see whether  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary to impose such a disqualification or not the  next\r\n\r\ntime when I look at the Road Traffic Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of definition of mobile phone driving and\r\n\r\nwhether  it is adequate or not, if there is a need to  re-define\r\n\r\nit  after  we have put the new law into force, we will re-define\r\n\r\nit.  The way it is defined now, I think, is adequate.  If it  is\r\n\r\nnot, I will consider amending the definition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen talked about enhancing the punishment for\r\n\r\nmotorists  who cause death while driving a vehicle.  In  1996  I\r\n\r\namended  the  Act  to provide for enhanced punishment  for  this\r\n\r\noffence.   So far, the situation is good.  Of course, from  time\r\n\r\nto  time, we have very serious cases and we all get very  worked\r\n\r\nup  over  such irresponsible driving behaviour, but we  have  to\r\n\r\ntake  such incidents, not just a particular one, in perspective.\r\n\r\nIf  we  were  to  enhance  the punishment  for  accidents  which\r\n\r\nresulted in death, we would have to re-look at the rest  of  the\r\n\r\noffences and see whether it is in proportion or in keeping  with\r\n\r\nthe  sentences of the other offences.  But we will bear that  in\r\n\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In page 1, line 4, the words \"No. 2\" will be\r\n\r\ndeleted; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In page 1, line 5, the citation \"1998\" will be changed to\r\n\r\n\"1999\".

Currently, there are two Acts which\r\n\r\nregulate  the  meat  and fish industries to  ensure  that  their\r\n\r\nproducts are safe for human consumption.  These Acts, which were\r\n\r\nenacted in the 1960s, are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Slaughter-houses and Meat Processing Factories Act; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Fisheries Act.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of these Acts are no longer adequate and need  to\r\n\r\nbe updated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than amend the relevant sections of the two Acts, it\r\n\r\nis  now  more logical to promulgate a new Act to regulate solely\r\n\r\nthe  processing  and  sales of meat and  fish  meant  for  human\r\n\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a comprehensive new Wholesome Meat\r\n\r\nand Fish Bill has therefore been drawn up.  The main features of\r\n\r\nthe Bill comprise four areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Regulating the import, export and transhipment of meat and\r\n\r\nfish products;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Licensing of slaughter-houses, processing establishments and\r\n\r\ncold stores;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Regulating the sale of meat and fish products; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Improving PPD's operational effectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go through and explain the rationale of the main\r\n\r\nfeatures of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Regulating the trade in meat and fish products</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Fisheries Act adopts a two-tiered control\r\n\r\nsystem  of  licences and permits for traders wishing to  import,\r\n\r\nexport or tranship fish products.  However, meat traders are not\r\n\r\nlicensed.  Provisions have therefore been included in  the  Bill\r\n\r\nto harmonise the requirements for the fish and meat trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clauses 5 and 6 respectively, trading licences and\r\n\r\npermits  for individual consignments will now be required.   All\r\n\r\nmeat and fish traders will have to be licensed.  The requirement\r\n\r\nfor  permits  for  individual consignments  will  give  PPD  the\r\n\r\nflexibility  to impose and enforce sanitary conditions  on  each\r\n\r\nconsignment so as to prevent the introduction of animal diseases\r\n\r\nof public health significance such as anthrax or mad-cow disease\r\n\r\ninto Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions have also been included to enhance the\r\n\r\ntransparency   of  licensing  procedures.   This   also   allows\r\n\r\nSingapore  to fulfil its WTO obligations.  Clause 8 enables  the\r\n\r\nDirector of Primary Production to deny anyone an import licence,\r\n\r\nor  to  impose  restrictions on the trade  if  he  considers  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to safeguard public health. It, however, also requires\r\n\r\nthe Director to provide the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\napplicant with written reasons if he refuses to issue  or  renew\r\n\r\nthe  licence  or  permit applied for under the  Act.   Clause  9\r\n\r\nallows  any  person aggrieved by the decision  of  the  Director\r\n\r\nregarding  the  grant, renewal, suspension or  revocation  of  a\r\n\r\nlicence or permit, to appeal to the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Licensing of slaughter-houses, processing establishments and cold stores</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 12 require the slaughter-houses, meat and\r\n\r\nfish  processing establishments and cold stores to be  licensed.\r\n\r\nThese  provisions are largely based on the Slaughter-houses  and\r\n\r\nMeat  Processing  Factories  Act and  the  regulations  on  fish\r\n\r\nprocessing  establishments  under  the  Fisheries  Act.    These\r\n\r\nestablishments  will be required to meet standards  set  by  the\r\n\r\nDirector  to  ensure  that  slaughter,  processing  and  storage\r\n\r\nconditions  maintain  the wholesomeness  of  the  meat  or  fish\r\n\r\nproducts.    The   Director  may  also  close   any   of   these\r\n\r\nestablishments if their condition poses a danger to health.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Sale of meat and fish products</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 strengthens the regulation of the handling of\r\n\r\nmeat  and  fish  in wholesale markets.  The wholesale  trade  of\r\n\r\nanimals  meant for food is also regulated to prevent the  spread\r\n\r\nof  diseases  among the animals, and to control the handling  of\r\n\r\nthe  animals which can have an impact on the safety and  quality\r\n\r\nof the meat subsequently derived from these animals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Improving PPD's operational effectiveness</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow PPD to overcome resource constraints and focus its\r\n\r\nlimited  manpower on the critical areas, clause 3  provides  PPD\r\n\r\nthe  flexibility  to outsource less critical operations  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector,  such as the inspection of animals  before  and\r\n\r\nafter  slaughter  at  licensed  slaughter-houses.   However,  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  a high standard of food safety is maintained,  PPD\r\n\r\nwill   specify  the  qualifications,  training  and   experience\r\n\r\nrequired for authorised examiners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhancement of investigation and enforcement powers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 24 to 27 strengthen the powers of investigation and\r\n\r\nenforcement.   Clause  25  allows the  Director  to  detain  the\r\n\r\nconfiscated items in the premises in which they were found.   It\r\n\r\nalso  requires the owner or occupier of the premises to  provide\r\n\r\nreasonable  assistance  to  the Director  or  veterinary  public\r\n\r\nhealth  officer in the investigation.  These powers are required\r\n\r\nas the meat or fish products under investigation may be in large\r\n\r\nquantities  and  due  to their perishable nature,  can  only  be\r\n\r\npractically detained in the place where they were found such  as\r\n\r\nrefrigerated containers or cold stores.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing legislation, only the court can order\r\n\r\nforfeiture  of  items  seized under the  Acts.   As  this  often\r\n\r\nresults  in  prolonged  detention of  the  items  and  incurring\r\n\r\nexpensive  storage  charges, clause  32(9)  has  therefore  been\r\n\r\nincluded  to allow the owner of the seized items to  consent  to\r\n\r\ntheir  disposal.  Such items are deemed to be forfeited and  may\r\n\r\nbe  disposed  of  as the Director thinks fit.   This  provision,\r\n\r\nhowever,   does  not  prevent  legal  proceedings   from   being\r\n\r\ninstituted against the owner of the items.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhancement of financial and custodial penalties</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalties of $500 to $2,000 fine and one-year imprisonment\r\n\r\nprovided  in the Slaughter-houses and Meat Processing  Factories\r\n\r\nAct are grossly inadequate in today's context.  Penalties should\r\n\r\nbe  commensurate  with the value of the goods involved  and  the\r\n\r\nseriousness and impact of the offence.  The penalties under this\r\n\r\nBill therefore range from $1,000 to $100,000 for fines and 1  to\r\n\r\n3  years for jail terms.  These high penalties have been set  to\r\n\r\nreflect the amount and value of the imported products, which may\r\n\r\nbe  in  the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  If  such\r\n\r\nquantity   of   goods  were  contaminated  and  distributed   to\r\n\r\nconsumers,  the  impact on public health would be  far-reaching.\r\n\r\nThese high penalties are therefore necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also provision for offences to be compounded. The\r\n\r\nmaximum sum for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  composition  of  offences  is  $1,000.   This  would  allow\r\n\r\nrelatively  minor  offences under the  Bill  to  be  dealt  with\r\n\r\nexpeditiously   without  the  need  for   instituting   criminal\r\n\r\nproceedings against the offender.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>\"Presumption\" clauses</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing legislation, a person found with\r\n\r\nillegally  imported or processed meat or fish products  can  get\r\n\r\noff  free from prosecution if he denies carrying out the  import\r\n\r\nor  processing.  On average, PPD encounters about 2  to  3  such\r\n\r\ncases per year.  This is not satisfactory as the consequences of\r\n\r\ndistribution and consumption of large quantities of  unwholesome\r\n\r\nmeat  or fish can be devastating to the public.  To protect  the\r\n\r\nconsumers,  clauses 6(5), 17(3), 20(3) and 23(3) have  therefore\r\n\r\nbeen  included to allow the person charged to show that  he  had\r\n\r\ntaken  reasonable precautions to prevent the commission  of  the\r\n\r\noffence,  and  that the offending act was done by  someone  else\r\n\r\nbeyond his control.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of the new Act, the Slaughter-houses and\r\n\r\nMeat  Processing  Factories  Act  and  relevant  parts  of   the\r\n\r\nFisheries Act will concurrently be repealed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Wholesome Meat and Fish Bill will\r\n\r\nconsolidate, update and strengthen existing regulations  on  the\r\n\r\nimport,  export  and  transhipment of meat  and  fish  products;\r\n\r\nslaughter  of animals; processing of meat and fish products  and\r\n\r\nwholesale of fish.  In addition, it will introduce regulation of\r\n\r\nwholesale  of  meat and animals intended for  food.   Powers  of\r\n\r\ninvestigation  and  enforcement have also been  strengthened  to\r\n\r\nensure that the provisions of the Bill are complied with,  while\r\n\r\nthe   high  penalties  would  act  as  a  deterrent  to   anyone\r\n\r\ncontemplating committing an offence under the Bill.   This  will\r\n\r\nensure  that meat and fish products continue to be safe for  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to eat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nseek clarification from the Minister.

The proposed\r\n\r\nBuilding  and Construction Authority Bill 1999 will provide  the\r\n\r\nrequired  legislative  framework for the formation  of  the  new\r\n\r\nstatutory board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new statutory board will be called the Building and\r\n\r\nConstruction Authority, BCA.  Its mission will be to  facilitate\r\n\r\nthe  development of a professional and technologically  advanced\r\n\r\nconstruction industry that is capable of delivering  world-class\r\n\r\nbuildings and infrastructure at competitive prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now share with this House the\r\n\r\nrationale   behind  the  Government's  decision  to  merge   the\r\n\r\nConstruction Industry Development Board (CIDB) and the  Building\r\n\r\nControl Division (BCD) to form a new statutory board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIDB was formed in 1984 to promote the development of\r\n\r\ntechnology  and manpower in the construction industry.   It  has\r\n\r\nachieved  much  over the last fifteen years in  terms  of  skill\r\n\r\nupgrading,  quality,  productivity  and  advanced  technologies.\r\n\r\nSkill  levels  have increased from about 2% in 1984  to  27%  in\r\n\r\n1998.   A  comprehensive quality assessment system  CONQUAS  has\r\n\r\nbeen introduced and quality scores have increased steadily since\r\n\r\nits  introduction  in  1988.  More than  4,000  contractors  and\r\n\r\nsuppliers are now registered with CIDB with more than  70  local\r\n\r\ncontractors in the top-most category.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in recent years, before the economic downturn, the\r\n\r\nindustry  had expanded too rapidly.  Productivity has  slackened\r\n\r\nsignificantly   as   the   industry   resorted   to   short-term\r\n\r\nunproductive  measures.   The  prevailing  economic   situation,\r\n\r\ntherefore, allows us a very good opportunity to restructure  the\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from a fundamental review of the various Government\r\n\r\nagencies dealing with the construction industry, we came to  two\r\n\r\nconclusions.   One, as previously announced, the  non-regulatory\r\n\r\nfunctions of the Public Works Department should be corporatised.\r\n\r\nTwo,  there would be synergy arising from the merging of BCD  of\r\n\r\nthe  PWD  with  the present CIDB.  Unlike other industries,  the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry operates within a well-defined  regulatory\r\n\r\nframework  -  this  is necessary because of  the  strong  public\r\n\r\ninterests at stake.  While CIDB's development efforts have borne\r\n\r\nfruit  in several areas, its progress has been moderated by  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  it  is  not  directly  involved  in  the  regulatory\r\n\r\nframework.   Putting  both the regulatory  and  the  development\r\n\r\nefforts under one body will allow the new statutory board to co-ordinate  the efforts of these two arms better.  The  new  board\r\n\r\nwill be able to leverage on the expertise and experience of both\r\n\r\nBCD   and   CIDB,  and  take  an  integrated  approach   towards\r\n\r\nrestructuring the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken the opportunity to make an amendment to allow\r\n\r\nthe   new  BCA  to  make  new  regulations  pertaining  to   the\r\n\r\nimprovement  of  efficiency  and  standardisation   of   design,\r\n\r\nprocesses,  construction  techniques,  products  and  materials.\r\n\r\nThis  will pave the way for the BCA to require mandatory minimum\r\n\r\nbuildable  scores for new buildings in a few years'  time.   The\r\n\r\nobjective  is  to hasten the adoption of more buildable  designs\r\n\r\nwhich  allow  the  buildings to be built using  more  productive\r\n\r\nconstruction  methods.   Although CIDB  has  promoted  buildable\r\n\r\ndesigns for several years, the adoption of such designs has been\r\n\r\nslow.   The  BCA  will  adopt  a  two-pronged  approach  towards\r\n\r\nbuildable  design  - developmental as well as regulatory.   More\r\n\r\ndetails will be given separately by the BCA when the details are\r\n\r\nfirmed up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Main Features of the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will now elaborate on the main\r\n\r\nfeatures of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of the Bill gives the short title and interpretation\r\n\r\nof   the   Bill.    Part  II  provides  for  the  establishment,\r\n\r\nincorporation and constitution of the Authority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III addresses the functions and powers of the\r\n\r\nAuthority.   In  particular, clause 9 of the  Bill  defines  the\r\n\r\nfunctions of the Authority.  The functions are drawn from  those\r\n\r\nof  the  current  CIDB  Act  and  Building  Control  Act.   Some\r\n\r\namendments are made to make them more up-to-date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers of the BCA are laid down in clause 10 of the\r\n\r\nBill.  Additional powers need to be given to BCA, as compared to\r\n\r\nCIDB.  This is to enable BCA to carry out its functions as  both\r\n\r\na  regulator  and a promoter.  For example, under clause  10(a),\r\n\r\nBCA   would  be  able  to  prescribe  the  standards   for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction   industry  in  relation  to   design,   processes,\r\n\r\nconstruction techniques, products and materials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clauses in Parts IV and V of the Bill relate to staff\r\n\r\nand  financial matters.  These are based on existing  provisions\r\n\r\nthat the current CIDB has to comply with.  In particular, clause\r\n\r\n13  will  provide for the appointment of the Chief Executive  of\r\n\r\nthe  Authority.  Clause 24 will require the accounts,  financial\r\n\r\nstatements  and auditor's report of the statutory  board  to  be\r\n\r\nsent to the Auditor-General, Minister and Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 25 to 31 of the Bill provide for the transfer of\r\n\r\nproperty, assets, liabilities and employees from CIDB and BCD to\r\n\r\nBCA.   Under clause 26, all persons employed immediately  before\r\n\r\n1st April 1999 by CIDB and BCD shall be transferred to BCA.  The\r\n\r\nterms  will  be  no less favourable than those  enjoyed  by  the\r\n\r\nofficers  immediately  prior  to their  transfer.   The  pension\r\n\r\nrights  of  Government employees would also be  preserved  under\r\n\r\nclause 27 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 36 provides for the repeal of the Construction\r\n\r\nIndustry Development Board Act.  This is necessary as CIDB  will\r\n\r\ncease to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexist with the formation of BCA.  Clause 36(4)(b) will amend the\r\n\r\nname  of  \"Building Authority\" in the Building  Control  Act  to\r\n\r\n\"Commissioner of Building Control\", unless otherwise provided in\r\n\r\nthe  Schedule  to the Bill.  This is to avoid confusion  between\r\n\r\nthe  name  of  \"Building Authority\" and  the  new  Building  and\r\n\r\nConstruction  Authority.  The same clause 36  also  repeals  the\r\n\r\nmoribund  Land Improvement Act, which was enacted in 1901.   PWD\r\n\r\ncurrently administers sections 10 and 12 of the Land Improvement\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule to the Bill provides for the necessary\r\n\r\nconsequential  amendments to some of the  existing  legislation.\r\n\r\nAmendments  will be made to the Foreshores Act to transfer  some\r\n\r\nof the functions presently under PWD to URA.  References made to\r\n\r\nthe  \"Building Authority\" and \"Deputy Director-General of Public\r\n\r\nWorks\" in the Railways Act will be amended to that of the  \"Land\r\n\r\nTransport  Authority\".  The Sand and Granite Quarries  Act  will\r\n\r\nalso  be amended to allow statutory board officers to administer\r\n\r\nthe relevant portions of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the construction industry will always\r\n\r\nremain  an  important  component of the  economy.   The  present\r\n\r\nrespite  from the heady days of past years allows us to  refocus\r\n\r\nour  efforts to upgrade the construction industry.  It  is  thus\r\n\r\ntimely   that   the  Building  and  Construction  Authority   be\r\n\r\nestablished  to  look  into strengthening Singapore's  long-term\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in the construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  support  the Building and Construction  Authority  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  basically  merges the regulatory functions  of  the  PWD,\r\n\r\nwhich  are currently under the Building Control Division  (BCD),\r\n\r\nand the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB), under  a\r\n\r\nnew  statutory  board.  I fully agree that with this  merger  it\r\n\r\nwill  yield greater synergy and cost-effectiveness as both  deal\r\n\r\nwith the design\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand construction stage of property development.  I have been  in\r\n\r\ndialogue  with industry practitioners regarding the above  Bill.\r\n\r\nAlthough  they support the establishment of the BCA,  they  have\r\n\r\nexpressed certain concerns that I would like to bring up to  the\r\n\r\nattention of the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the function of the BCD is regulatory in nature.\r\n\r\nIt  coordinates the technical departments such as the URA,  FSB,\r\n\r\nENV,   LTA,   National   Parks,   and   so   on,   during    the\r\n\r\nbuilding/planning process.  The CIDB's functions,  however,  are\r\n\r\nmore promotional in nature.  After the merger, the industry  has\r\n\r\nexpressed  concern  that  the  BCA  might  focus  too  much   on\r\n\r\nregulation  rather than promotion.  So they hope  that  the  BCA\r\n\r\nwould continue with this promotional functions as before, as the\r\n\r\nname  \"Authority\" may perhaps change the mindset  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotional functions and efforts of the old CIDB have\r\n\r\nbeen  much  appreciated by the building industry in  helping  to\r\n\r\nlift  the  standard of construction.  The continuation  of  this\r\n\r\nrole  under  BCA,  I am sure, will benefit all  players  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry.  Presently, architects and engineers still have to get\r\n\r\napproval for building plans from a number of Government  bodies,\r\n\r\nalthough  the  BCD coordinates many of these functions.   It  is\r\n\r\nhoped  that more of these functions can now be centralsied under\r\n\r\nthe  BCA  to  provide  a one-stop shop for  the  convenience  of\r\n\r\nindustry practitioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the functions of the new BCA, which is clearly stated\r\n\r\nunder  clause  9(1)(d), is \"to promote good procurement  methods\r\n\r\nand practices in the construction industry and advise and assist\r\n\r\nthe  Government  in  the procurement of construction  works  and\r\n\r\nservices\".   According to industry feedback,  today,  frequently\r\n\r\ndifferent   Government  agencies  adopt  different   procurement\r\n\r\nmethods and they are considered inequitable with the practice of\r\n\r\nthe  industry.  With the passage of this new Bill, the  industry\r\n\r\nwould  like to see the BCA standardise such procurement  methods\r\n\r\nand  disseminate  to all Government bodies for  compliance.   In\r\n\r\nreviewing such procurement methods,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspecial consideration should also be given to promote the  local\r\n\r\nprofessionals and the local building industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also given to understand that, currently, PWD has\r\n\r\nestablished  several  panels  of  private  consultants  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  undertaking  public  sector  projects.   As   such,\r\n\r\nprojects  that  PWD  can  farm out are given  to  these  private\r\n\r\nconsultants on the panels.  With the corporatisation of PWD,  it\r\n\r\nis  recommended  that the proposed BCA take over  this  role  of\r\n\r\nmanaging these panels so as to create a more level playing field\r\n\r\nfor all in the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With greater synergy and cost effectiveness, as pointed out\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister in the formation of the new BCA, the  industry\r\n\r\nwould  also  like  to see lower fees for the processing  of  all\r\n\r\nkinds   of  applications  by  the  industry  practitioners.    I\r\n\r\nunderstand   that  the  Board  of  Architects  right   now   has\r\n\r\nrepresentation by three to four architects from the  PWD.   With\r\n\r\nthe  corporatisation of the PWD, the Minister may want  to  look\r\n\r\nagain  more  closely  into  the  composition  of  the  Board  of\r\n\r\nArchitects  to give it a better representation from the  private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the concerns of many of these points brought up by\r\n\r\nthe  industry.   Some of these concerns may be  unfounded.    If\r\n\r\nthey are, there is obviously a perception and communication  gap\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Ministry  and  the industry.   Perhaps,  a  better\r\n\r\ncommunication programme could be instituted to bridge this gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me say that I believe that the merger of\r\n\r\nthe  regulatory  functions  under  BCD  and  the  promotion   of\r\n\r\nfunctions  under  CIDB  into the BCA is  a  move  in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.   The public and the building industry  practitioners\r\n\r\nwelcome the initiative.  However, I hope the Minister will  take\r\n\r\nthe feedback of industry practitioners into consideration during\r\n\r\nthis exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the Building and Construction\r\n\r\nAuthority  (BCA)  is  indeed  a  step  towards  integrating  the\r\n\r\nfunctions of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvarious  authorities presently responsible for the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.   As  I  have mentioned before,  we  need  a  one-stop\r\n\r\ncentre,  be  it  a Construction Ministry or statutory  board  to\r\n\r\nspearhead the construction industry into the next millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry is a complex industry that\r\n\r\ninvolves  many statutory boards and industries.  To upgrade  the\r\n\r\nindustry,  we need to adopt an integrated approach to facilitate\r\n\r\nits development and expansion.  Although the Bill integrates the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of the Building Control Division and the Construction\r\n\r\nIndustry  Development Board, it lacks the integration needed  to\r\n\r\nimprove   on   productivity,   quality,   professionalism    and\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of the construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major setback is the lack of power given to the\r\n\r\nBuilding  and  Construction Authority to  exercise  development,\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  fire safety control over  the  development  of\r\n\r\nbuildings  and  infrastructure works.  A  one-stop  centre  that\r\n\r\nencompasses   all   these   functions   would   provide   better\r\n\r\ncoordination  and  accountability which should further  increase\r\n\r\nthe efficiency of development and construction works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me discuss the details of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Functions of Authority</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although clause 9 has laid out many functions of BCA, there\r\n\r\nis  no  mention of any effort to promote the use of  information\r\n\r\ntechnology,  innovative and efficient design  and  environmental\r\n\r\nprotection  to  improve the construction industry.   Information\r\n\r\ntechnology   and  environmental  protection  are  key   concerns\r\n\r\naffecting the construction industry of many developed countries,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Japan, USA and UK.  Thus, it is essential for  BCA  to\r\n\r\naddress these issues which have direct impact on the development\r\n\r\nof the construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9(1) also does not include the function to regulate\r\n\r\nand enforce building regulations and Acts in the industry.  As a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuilding  authority, BCA must ensure the compliance of  building\r\n\r\nregulations and Acts and take enforcement actions to ensure that\r\n\r\nbuildings and infrastructure works are properly constructed  for\r\n\r\nsafe occupancy and usage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9(1)(c) has apparently omitted the need to encourage\r\n\r\nstandardisation   and   improvement  of   information   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.   At  present,  there  is  a   lack   of\r\n\r\nstandardisation  of  information  in  the  industry.   This  has\r\n\r\nresulted in wastages, abortive works and disputes among  parties\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  construction and development  works.   The  recent\r\n\r\ncourt  case on the definition of \"built-up\" and \"built-in\" areas\r\n\r\nis  an example of the lack of understanding among players in the\r\n\r\nindustry.    To  improve  productivity,  BCA  should   implement\r\n\r\nstandardisation of information in the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9(1)(e) allows BCA to provide consultancy and\r\n\r\nadvisory  services related to the construction industry.   As  a\r\n\r\nregulatory  authority,  there  may  be  potential  conflict   of\r\n\r\ninterest for BCA to provide such services especially for private\r\n\r\nsector projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9(1)(j) also specifies that BCA will promote and\r\n\r\ncarry  out research for the development and improvement  of  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.   While it is  appropriate  for  BCA  to\r\n\r\npromote  research, research work should be carried  out  by  our\r\n\r\nuniversities and other research institutions.  Both NUS and  NTU\r\n\r\nare  equipped with research facilities and resources, which  can\r\n\r\nundertake  multi-disciplinary research.  Thus, BCA should  avoid\r\n\r\nduplication of effort and wasting of resources in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Powers of Authority</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10(a) mentions that BCA may prescribe standards for\r\n\r\nthe  construction  industry  in  relation  to  design,  process,\r\n\r\nconstruction techniques, products and materials.  Presently, the\r\n\r\nProductivity  and Standards Board prescribes all  standards  and\r\n\r\ncodes  of practice for the construction industry.  May I clarify\r\n\r\nwith the Minister whether this function will be transferred from\r\n\r\nPSB to BCA?  If so, there must be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovisions in the Bill for the transfer of authority,  property,\r\n\r\nassets and liabilities from PSB to BCA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10(e) highlights that BCA can conduct tests and\r\n\r\naward  diplomas  and  certificates  of  proficiency.   I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  it is appropriate for the Authority to award  diplomas.\r\n\r\nThis  may  cause  confusion among employers in the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry  with  regard to the recognition of such  diplomas.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to suggest that diploma training should be channelled\r\n\r\nto  the  respective polytechnics so as to avoid  duplication  of\r\n\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10(i) states that BCA can enter into a partnership\r\n\r\nor  an  arrangement for the sharing of profits.  May I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  under  what  circumstances can  such  partnerships  or\r\n\r\narrangements take place and who are the likely partners?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to upgrade the construction industry, there is an\r\n\r\nurgent  need  to  control  the quality of  participants  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry.   The  BCA  should be empowered to issue  licences  to\r\n\r\npractitioners  and firms in the industry.  It should  provide  a\r\n\r\none-stop  centre  for the issuance of licences so  that  quality\r\n\r\ncontrol  can  be  centralised.   Stringent  control  should   be\r\n\r\nexercised  to  register  and  license  construction  firms   and\r\n\r\npractitioners.   Presently,  we  have  registered  or   licensed\r\n\r\narchitects,  engineers, plumbers, electricians, safety  officers\r\n\r\nand  cable  detectors.   We  should  take  further  measures  to\r\n\r\nconsider  licensing  the  other professionals  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry,  namely, builders,  quantity  surveyors,\r\n\r\nproject managers and property managers so as to raise the  level\r\n\r\nof professionalism in the industry as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Building and Construction Authority can\r\n\r\nplay  a leading role to improve the quality and productivity  of\r\n\r\nthe construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to speak in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the new Building and Construction\r\n\r\nAuthority comprising\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  current CIDB and BCD of PWD should be welcomed as good news\r\n\r\nto  the construction industry.  As mentioned by the Minister, up\r\n\r\nto  now,  CIDB  and BCD perform their roles quite independently.\r\n\r\nCIDB  will  deal  with  all  the promotional  and  developmental\r\n\r\naspects of construction industry at the downstream of the  value\r\n\r\nchain.   They  handle the registration of contractors,  training\r\n\r\nand   certification  of  workers,  promote  new  materials   and\r\n\r\nprocesses.   BCD, on the other hand, regulates and controls  the\r\n\r\nbuilding   works  at  the  upstream  and  they  deal  with   the\r\n\r\ndevelopers,  architects and planners.  Today,  the  coordination\r\n\r\nbetween these two entities can be said to be minimal.  Often, if\r\n\r\none  entity wanted to do, it may not achieve the cooperation  of\r\n\r\nthe  other.   This  has  resulted,  as  the  Minister  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, in a delay in implementing measures to help promote the\r\n\r\noverall well-being of the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the merger to form one single entity under one\r\n\r\nChairman  and  one Board of Directors, I can envisage  that  the\r\n\r\nmerged entity would be a more effective one.  On one hand,  CIDB\r\n\r\nwould  be  able,  with  the regulatory power  of  BCD,  to  move\r\n\r\nupstream  to enforce the promotional measures that it previously\r\n\r\nfound powerless to impose.  On the other hand, BCD now would  be\r\n\r\nable  to  better exercise the building control and  approval  of\r\n\r\nplans  with a good knowledge of the latest construction methods,\r\n\r\nequipment  and availability of skilled workers.  This integrated\r\n\r\napproach will help to accelerate the process of skills upgrading\r\n\r\nand reduction on its dependence on foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I digress now to speak on the status of the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry  today.  There are  currently  more  than\r\n\r\n200,000  foreign construction workers.  Our indigenous  pool  of\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the  industry is very small.  It is around  30,000.\r\n\r\nThe  foreign workers, whether they are skilled or not, have come\r\n\r\nand gone.  While they are here, we train them from unskilled  to\r\n\r\nsemi-skilled,  to  skilled  and to be trade-certified,  and  all\r\n\r\nthese cost a lot of money.  At the same time, the quality of our\r\n\r\nconstruction also suffers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at first glance, we seem to have an advantage by having\r\n\r\ncheap  labour.   But if we add up all the costs,  like  training\r\n\r\ncost,  defect cost, time cost and social cost, I think the total\r\n\r\ncost is probably higher.  This helps to explain partially why we\r\n\r\nhave  a  higher  construction cost and yet our  quality  is  not\r\n\r\ncommensurate with the cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at this point, I would like to commend\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for boldly introducing the new functions  of  the\r\n\r\nauthority  that would give the industry a quantum  leap  in  the\r\n\r\noverall  efficiency.  The new Bill places a lot of  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nthe   promotion   and   development  of  advanced   methods   of\r\n\r\nconstruction.   In  particular, as  part  of  the  consequential\r\n\r\namendments to the Building Control Act, the Bill states that  it\r\n\r\nwill   introduce   measures  to  improve  the   efficiency   and\r\n\r\nstandardisation in the construction industry relating to  design\r\n\r\nprocesses, construction techniques, products and materials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of this House would know, Singapore inherited the\r\n\r\nconstruction  system  from  the British.   All  along,  we  have\r\n\r\npractised  what the British did 20 or 30 years ago.   Typically,\r\n\r\nfor a development project, the property developer's main concern\r\n\r\nwas  maximisation or short-term gain by asking the architect  to\r\n\r\ndeliver  the  maximum saleable or lettable area in the  shortest\r\n\r\npossible time without regard for ease of construction.  Then the\r\n\r\nstructural  engineers  are called in after  the  architects  and\r\n\r\ndevelopers have more or less finalised the concept plan and they\r\n\r\nare  asked  to come out, in the shortest possible time,  with  a\r\n\r\nstructural design, again, without regard to buildability.  So by\r\n\r\nthe  time  the project is tendered out, the basic architectural,\r\n\r\nstructural,  mechanical, electrical designs are all  firmed  up.\r\n\r\nThe  contractor who wins the bid would have no input  whatsoever\r\n\r\nto the entire design process.  But the contractor is usually the\r\n\r\nbest  guy to know which method of construction is the best.   So\r\n\r\nthe  process we have would not allow the contractor  to  exploit\r\n\r\nhis  expertise.   And  if we continue with  this  practice,  our\r\n\r\nconstruction industry will continue to be burdened with labour\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nintensive and inefficient construction processes.  We are  lucky\r\n\r\nthat  the  CIDB  has introduced the buildability concept  a  few\r\n\r\nyears ago to address this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate a little bit on buildability. In layman's\r\n\r\nterms, it can be said to be the ease with which the construction\r\n\r\nproduct  can  be  made and it is computed with a formula  giving\r\n\r\ndifferent  weightages to various construction methods, materials\r\n\r\nusage and standardisation of dimensions.  A high buildable score\r\n\r\nfor  a  project  indicates  that the  project  is  less  labour-intensive and more efficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, some Government departments, such as HDB, Mindef,\r\n\r\nPWD,  etc,  have used the score to gauge if their projects  have\r\n\r\nbeen  designed  for  efficient construction.   And  two  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries,  that  is,  Denmark  and  South  Korea,   have   even\r\n\r\nlegislated  part  of  the buildability, ie, the  standardisation\r\n\r\npart,  to  promote  productivity  and  efficiency.   Within  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  departments  and  statutory  boards,  the\r\n\r\nimplementation has been quite successful.  Many public  projects\r\n\r\nhave  attained high productivity with competitive  cost.   These\r\n\r\ndepartments  have  found  relative  ease  in  implementing  this\r\n\r\nconcept  because  they  could  control  the  entire  process  of\r\n\r\nconstruction,  ie,  from conceptualisation to  final  execution.\r\n\r\nBut  in the private sector, the scenario is quite different.   I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is why this Bill has to provide for legislation  of\r\n\r\nbuildability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector, possibly owing to unfamiliarity or\r\n\r\nfear of loss of creativity or fear of high cost, this concept of\r\n\r\nbuildability has not been readily embraced, notwithstanding that\r\n\r\nit  has been successful in the public sector.  As a result,  the\r\n\r\nlabour  productivity of private projects tends to be low and  it\r\n\r\npulls  down  the national average year after year.  I personally\r\n\r\ndo  not  believe high buildability is associated with monotonous\r\n\r\nand  stereotype  designs.   On  the  contrary,  many  buildings,\r\n\r\nwhether  they are local or overseas, have attained a  very  high\r\n\r\nstandard of aesthetics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In advanced countries such as USA or Australia, all doors\r\n\r\nand windows are mass produced in standard dimensions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDesigners  of buildings simply buy them from the shelf  or  from\r\n\r\nmail order, and nowadays from the Internet.  In Singapore, there\r\n\r\nis  no  standardisation of windows and doors.  All  have  to  be\r\n\r\ntailor-made.   And  similarly, the room sizes in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\ndimensioned  in such a way that there is always a  lot  of  tile\r\n\r\ncutting  at  the edges.  All these practices cause wastages  and\r\n\r\npoor workmanship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other industries, standardisation has proved to be a\r\n\r\ngood  way to make things buildable and the most notable examples\r\n\r\nare   in   the   auto  industry.   Nowadays,   most   cars   use\r\n\r\ninterchangeable parts.  Car manufacturers also try to build cars\r\n\r\nwith  as few platforms as possible.  Just recently, Ford  Motors\r\n\r\nlaunched  three distinctly different models, namely, the  sports\r\n\r\ncar,  Firebird,  the  American  saloon,  the  Lincoln,  and  the\r\n\r\nluxurious Jaguar S.  All of them have the same chassis  and  all\r\n\r\nthese three models are aesthetically appealing, even though they\r\n\r\nshare  a  lot  of common parts.  This leads us to believe  that,\r\n\r\nthrough  concerted effort, both aesthetics and buildability  can\r\n\r\nbe  achieved  in  the  construction  industry.   BCA,  with  its\r\n\r\nregulatory  power,  should  now  be  able  to  implement   these\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill, I note that the authority would have a new\r\n\r\nfunction,  and  that  is,  to  raise  the  professionalism   and\r\n\r\ncapability  of  firms  in the construction  industry.   On  this\r\n\r\npoint,  I have several comments.  First, it is easier said  than\r\n\r\ndone  to  raise professionalism in our industry.  It is a  known\r\n\r\nfact that in the construction industry, some clerks-of-works and\r\n\r\nresident  engineers do not quite practise their professionalism.\r\n\r\nThey  would  deliberately delay the progress of  a  project  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own  benefit.  CIDB has, not too long  ago,  conducted  a\r\n\r\nsurvey and found some shocking results, ie, the delays caused by\r\n\r\nclerks-of-works and the resident engineers have resulted in 2-3%\r\n\r\nwastage in our annual turnover.  If we take $20 billion  as  our\r\n\r\nnational annual turnover, that means we have lost one centre for\r\n\r\nthe performing arts each year.  This lack of professionalism  by\r\n\r\nthe  site supervisory staff has been highlighted time after time\r\n\r\nbut  the  problem has never been eradicated and I hope  the  new\r\n\r\nauthority, with its enhanced power, can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfind  a  way to resolve this perennial problem.  One possibility\r\n\r\nwould be the registration of clerks-of-works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second comment I have is that the construction industry\r\n\r\nneeds badly a fair and equitable contract.  The current form  of\r\n\r\ncontract  tends  to be one-sided, biased towards protecting  the\r\n\r\ndevelopers  and consultants excessively.  One example  of  their\r\n\r\ncatch-all  clauses is \"unless otherwise expressly provided,  the\r\n\r\ncontract sum and contractor's rates and processing in the  rates\r\n\r\nshall  be  inclusive  of  all  ancillary  and  other  works  and\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  whether  separately or specifically  mentioned  or\r\n\r\ndescribed  in  the  contract  or not,  which  are  indispensably\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  carry  out  and bring  to  completion  the  works\r\n\r\ndescribed  in the contract or may contingently become  necessary\r\n\r\nto overcome difficulties before completion.\"  Another example is\r\n\r\nthat the information given is only a guide.  The party providing\r\n\r\nthe  information holds no responsibility for the accuracy of the\r\n\r\ninformation.  These examples illustrate that the contract itself\r\n\r\nprotects some parties excessively, so much so that they need not\r\n\r\nbe  professional  in  their conduct.  So, in  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nprofessionalism,   I  believe  BCA  should   ensure   that   all\r\n\r\ncontracting  parties have equitably distributed responsibilities\r\n\r\nand liabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third comment I have is related to the promotion of\r\n\r\ncapability of firms in construction and I am glad that  the  new\r\n\r\nauthority  recognises the need to do so.  I  believe  that  this\r\n\r\ncannot  be  achieved  without looking at the  wider  and  higher\r\n\r\nGovernment  policy  on  whether we would accept  unfair  trading\r\n\r\npractices  of  dumping in our country.  I have touched  on  this\r\n\r\ntopic  in  the  debate  on  the  Report  of  the  Committee   on\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Competitiveness last  November.   Our  construction\r\n\r\nindustry  is a fairly small one.  Some of the largest  firms  in\r\n\r\nthe  world individually have an annual turnover in dollar  terms\r\n\r\nmore  than our entire industry.  Therefore, it is very easy  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  practise marginal pricing or dumping to gain a  market\r\n\r\nshare  and  to  deprive local firms from getting  the  necessary\r\n\r\ntrack   records   which  are  essential  for  players   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry to continue bidding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  expanding.   Some  foreign firms  are  even  registered  as\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries  with limited liability and they sublet  the  whole\r\n\r\nwork  so  as to pass down the losses to the local subcontractors\r\n\r\nand  suppliers.   On the surface, the developers,  be  they  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  private, get a better price for  their  product.\r\n\r\nBut  the  parties they subsidise are not necessarily the foreign\r\n\r\nparty  but also the numerous local suppliers and subcontractors.\r\n\r\nIn view of this, I urge the new authority, while trying to raise\r\n\r\nthe  capability of firms and to promote good procurement methods\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government, to explore beyond the current  procurement\r\n\r\npolicies  to  curb the malpractices.  If not,  things  that  had\r\n\r\nhappened in the last 15 years would continue to happen, and some\r\n\r\nof   these  functions  of  the  new  authority  would   not   be\r\n\r\nsubstantially fulfilled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last area I wish to comment on is to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he  would empower the BCA to be the final authority  on\r\n\r\nmatters relating to the construction industry.  In the past  one\r\n\r\nweek, we read a lot in the newspapers about the dispute over the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"built-up\" and \"built-in\" area.  Should  we  leave\r\n\r\nit  to the Court or the industry to sort it out?  Or should  BCA\r\n\r\ncome up with a definition once and for all?  I am sure that  the\r\n\r\ndevelopers  and  consumers  alike would  be  keen  to  know  the\r\n\r\noutcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also occasions whereby there are discrepancies\r\n\r\nbetween BCD and some other authorities.  For example, the  issue\r\n\r\nof  landfill.  BCD has certain restrictions but the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe  Environment would usually like the land to  be  filled  up.\r\n\r\nThese  are  contradictory rules.  If no  one  can  prevail,  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  sorting out can take a long time and  can  be  very\r\n\r\ncostly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, now that BCA is about to be formed,\r\n\r\nI  wish the Minister could get BCA to standardise all submission\r\n\r\nrequirements  and procedures for everybody in the  country.   At\r\n\r\npresent,  for example, some parties are still allowed  to  carry\r\n\r\nout  work  without obtaining a permit to commence work.   For  a\r\n\r\nsmall\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnation  like  ours,  we  should  be  in  a  better  position  to\r\n\r\nstandardise all procedures to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to suggest to the Minister that for\r\n\r\noptimum running of this authority, the appointed Chairman should\r\n\r\nnot  be  currently involved in a statutory board or organisation\r\n\r\nwhose  major interest is in the area of property development  or\r\n\r\nconstruction.   Yet,  he  should  have  a  good  knowledge   and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  the industry.  The Board of Directors,  which\r\n\r\ncan  have  up  to  12  members, should not just  comprise  those\r\n\r\npractising  professionals and contractors.   It  should  include\r\n\r\nother  disciplines such as sociologists, manufacturers, bankers,\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  consumers, to get a  broad  and  balanced\r\n\r\nrepresentation for such a complex industry.  It would definitely\r\n\r\nbe  in the best interest of all people in this country to see  a\r\n\r\nprogressive, vibrant and efficient construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> First, let me thank Members for their\r\n\r\ninputs  and support of the Bill.  We try in this creation  of  a\r\n\r\nnew  statutory  board  to  undertake  both  the  regulatory  and\r\n\r\npromotion  functions in a balanced manner.   I  thank  them  for\r\n\r\ntheir  high aspirations of what the authority would  do,  but  I\r\n\r\nmust  dampen  all  expectations.   We  are  not  intending  this\r\n\r\nstatutory   board  to  undertake  the  centralisation   of   all\r\n\r\nregulatory functions over the construction industry.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany other functions undertaken by other Ministries, whether  it\r\n\r\nis  the  Fire  Safety Bureau or the Ministry of the Environment.\r\n\r\nThere  are so many other technical specialities.  It is not  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  the  BCA to be responsible for  every  speciality\r\n\r\nunder  regulation.   What the BCA would continue  to  do  is  to\r\n\r\ncoordinate  the requirements of the various agencies and,  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  conflicts,  try to get the  government  agencies  to\r\n\r\nresolve  these conflicts expeditiously.  That I pledge  the  BCA\r\n\r\nwould continue its functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have gone through this debate on whether we should\r\n\r\ncentralise  with  a one-stop service or we should  decentralise.\r\n\r\nThis is a never ending debate.  If I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncentralise,  you  will accuse me of being too powerful  and  too\r\n\r\ndogmatic,  a dictator over the construction industry,  and  that\r\n\r\nwas  what happened in 1986 when we decentralised.  Now  that  we\r\n\r\ndecentralise, you say, \"You are not helping us enough.  Can  you\r\n\r\nnow undertake all the functions together?\"  I think we stay with\r\n\r\nthe  present arrangement.  It has worked quite well.   BCA  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to help, coordinate the requirements and if  you  find\r\n\r\nconflicting requirements, we will lend our strength to  get  the\r\n\r\nagencies to sort out the conflicting requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On procurement methods, we have tried to standardise the\r\n\r\ncontract  at least in the public sector.  It is not possible  to\r\n\r\nstandardise  the contract in the private sector  because  it  is\r\n\r\namong  contracting  parties.  It is between you  and  the  other\r\n\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On private consultant panels, this will continue to be\r\n\r\nadministered by BCA once PWD is corporatised.  PWD  would  be  a\r\n\r\nprivate  consultant,  just like any private  consultant  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket.   The  body administering the private consultant  panels\r\n\r\nfor the Government would be transferred to BCA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the other issues raised by Dr Teo. I think the\r\n\r\nrole of the BCA would also be to promote information technology,\r\n\r\nenvironmental  protection, etc.  This comes under the  catch-all\r\n\r\nterm  of advanced technologies.  Many of the issues that Dr  Teo\r\n\r\nhas  raised about safety and structural requirements are covered\r\n\r\nunder the Building Control Act.  So the aim of this Bill is  not\r\n\r\nto replace the Building Control Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I endorse the comments of both Mr Chuang and Dr Teo about\r\n\r\nstandardisation.  One of the key features in this Bill is to put\r\n\r\nin place the legislation for buildability in two to three years'\r\n\r\ntime.  To be fair to the construction industry, we ought to give\r\n\r\nall the players advance notice that this is how we would want to\r\n\r\ntake  the  industry,  and  we want to set  certain  buildability\r\n\r\nscores  as the requirement to be legislated.   The industry  has\r\n\r\nbeen  given due notice and we will put the legislation  to  have\r\n\r\nbuildability scores and the methods in place over the  next  two\r\n\r\nto three years.  In this,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe will work with the industry.  This is in line with Mr Lew Syn\r\n\r\nPau's  point  about better communication within the construction\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no conflict with the research. BCA will promote\r\n\r\nresearch in conjunction with NSTB and PSB.  The research  itself\r\n\r\nwill be done by the universities or other agencies.  There is no\r\n\r\nintention  for  BCA to be directly involved in the  construction\r\n\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for awarding of diplomas, we have the Construction\r\n\r\nIndustry  Training Centre (CITC) under the current  CIDB.   They\r\n\r\nare  upgrading  their  courses  and  working  with  the  various\r\n\r\npolytechnics.   They  will  be in a position  to  award  certain\r\n\r\nspecialised  diplomas  for  certain  specific  skills   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.  So again there is no overlap  with  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked under what circumstances would BCA go\r\n\r\ninto  partnership for profit, etc.  This is in a  very  confined\r\n\r\narea.   For  example, the old CIDB undertakes  the  construction\r\n\r\nexhibition  every  year  and  this  is  a  private  construction\r\n\r\nexhibition  which involves a private contract and they  do  make\r\n\r\nprofits.   This is to enable them to continue to do  such  joint\r\n\r\nventures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened to Mr Chuang's very passionate comments\r\n\r\nabout   using   buildability  and  to  raise  the   professional\r\n\r\nstandards.  I fully agree with his comments.  It is part of  the\r\n\r\nmission  of the BCA to raise the professional standards  of  the\r\n\r\nindustry.   We  have tried to encourage the use  of  design-and-build so that consultants and contractors get together early  to\r\n\r\ndesign  and build something that is buildable and aesthetic  and\r\n\r\ncompetitively  priced.  Over time, the use  of  design-and-build\r\n\r\nhas  taken  on in the industry but we will continue  to  promote\r\n\r\nthis method of construction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I would like to thank the Members for their\r\n\r\ninputs.  We thank Members for the confidence that BCA would  try\r\n\r\nto  do all things for all people.  We will try our best but,  as\r\n\r\nMembers  realise, the construction industry is  a  very  complex\r\n\r\nindustry.  It involves many, many players and I am sure we  will\r\n\r\nhave to do a better coordination job overall.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In page i to leave out \"1998\" where it occurs\r\n\r\nin  the 2 lines above the line \"Arrangement of Sections\" and  to\r\n\r\ninsert \"1999\".

This Bill seeks to improve\r\n\r\nthe  financial management of Town Councils by making changes  to\r\n\r\nthe  use  and regulation of their funds. At the same  time,  the\r\n\r\namendment  widens  the powers and duties  of  Town  Councils  to\r\n\r\nenhance their operational efficiency and effectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Changes to Town Councils' Funds</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about the proposed changes to section 33. The\r\n\r\nBill  seeks to make three changes to Town Councils' funds  under\r\n\r\nsection 33.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Town Councils are allowed to use their funds\r\n\r\nfor the maintenance of facilities erected on common property  in\r\n\r\ntheir  towns.   However, some improvement works put  up  by  the\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Consultative Committees (CCCs)  under  the  Community\r\n\r\nImprovement  Projects  Committee  (CIPC)  scheme,  or  by   Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  themselves  during their Interim Upgrading  Programmes\r\n\r\n(IUPs),  were  erected on non-common property  in  their  towns.\r\n\r\nThese  facilities  are mainly for the use and enjoyment  of  HDB\r\n\r\nresidents living in the vicinity. Although funding was available\r\n\r\nfor  the construction of these facilities, there is no provision\r\n\r\nfor  their maintenance. Allowing the Town Councils to use  their\r\n\r\nfunds to maintain these facilities should therefore be viewed as\r\n\r\nan  extension  of the Town Councils' services to better  address\r\n\r\nthe needs of residents.  In practical terms, Town Councils would\r\n\r\nalso  be in the best position to maintain such facilities  which\r\n\r\nare  not on common property.  The Bill therefore seeks to  allow\r\n\r\nTown  Councils, with the approval of the Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, to use the Town Councils' funds for the maintenance\r\n\r\nof facilities erected on non-common property in their towns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Town Councils Act currently does not allow Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  to  make  inter-activity transfer of  funds  in  their\r\n\r\nsinking funds.  Funds set aside for activities under \"Market and\r\n\r\nFood  Centres\"  cannot  be  used  for  activities  under  \"Other\r\n\r\nCommercial Property\". In reality, however, the market  and  food\r\n\r\ncentres   are   an  integral  part  of  the  shopping/commercial\r\n\r\nactivities  of the Neighbourhood Centres/Town Centres,  as  both\r\n\r\nactivities,  the  market  and food  stalls  and  the  commercial\r\n\r\nactivities, complement each other.  To streamline the  financial\r\n\r\noperations of Town Councils, the Bill proposes to merge  \"Market\r\n\r\nand  Food  Centres\"  with \"Other Commercial  Property\"  under  a\r\n\r\nsingle  combined  category called \"Commercial  Property\".   With\r\n\r\nthis, their respective operating funds will be merged, as will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir respective sinking funds. This will allow Town Councils to\r\n\r\nuse the funds for the management, maintenance and improvement of\r\n\r\nthe common areas for all types of commercial property within the\r\n\r\nTown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Bill proposes to give the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational Development the flexibility to prescribe the accounting\r\n\r\nmethod for the minimum amount of service and conservancy charges\r\n\r\n(S&CC)  to  be  credited  to the sinking funds  established  for\r\n\r\nresidential and commercial properties.  Prescribing the  use  of\r\n\r\nthe  accrual accounting method, which is based on the amount  of\r\n\r\nS&CC collectible, will require Town Councils to reflect the S&CC\r\n\r\narrears  of  their sinking funds in their financial  statements.\r\n\r\nThis  will  highlight the level of funds available for  cyclical\r\n\r\nrepairs and maintenance when the time comes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Discretion to Levy Different Rates of Charges</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on now to section 38. Currently, section 38 of the\r\n\r\nAct  only  allows  Town  Councils to  levy  different  rates  of\r\n\r\ncharges,  ie,  S&CC charges,  for different types  and  uses  of\r\n\r\nflats  and stalls by way of by-laws.  The Bill seeks to  provide\r\n\r\nTown Councils the flexibility to levy different rates of charges\r\n\r\nfor  the  same type of flats and stalls in accordance with  such\r\n\r\ncriteria  as  they  may determine.  For example,  Town  Councils\r\n\r\ncould  levy higher charges for upgraded flats and stalls  as  it\r\n\r\ncosts   more  to  maintain  the  upgraded  facilities  and   the\r\n\r\nenvironment   surrounding  it.  While  this  Bill  allows   Town\r\n\r\nCouncils, if passed by Parliament, to charge different rates for\r\n\r\nthe  same flat type, I understand from the news report that  the\r\n\r\nPAP  Town  Councils  are  unlikely to change  the  present  S&CC\r\n\r\ncharges.   Similarly,  differential  charges  could  be   levied\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  level  of service and  types  of  facilities\r\n\r\nrequired  by residents.  For example, some blocks of  flats  may\r\n\r\nrequire more cleaning compared to a different block of flats  of\r\n\r\nthe  same  type.  So Town Councils will have the flexibility  to\r\n\r\ncharge  different S&CC charges on the same flat type because  it\r\n\r\ncosts more to maintain a particular block\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof flats.  The amendment is also necessary to give effect to the\r\n\r\npolicy decision to levy different rates of charges for the  same\r\n\r\nflat  type,  based  on  criteria  such  as  citizenship  of  the\r\n\r\nlessee/tenant  and whether or not he has any interest  in  other\r\n\r\nimmovable property.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Contribution to the Premium for Fire Insurance</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move to section 21 of the proposed amendment. At\r\n\r\npresent, HDB has a Board-wide Fire Insurance Policy to safeguard\r\n\r\nits  properties, including the common property.  Although it  is\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of the Town Councils to maintain and  manage\r\n\r\nthe  common  property, the Town Councils  are  not  required  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the insurance premium.  Section 21  is  therefore\r\n\r\namended  to  make it the duty of Town Councils,  as  the  estate\r\n\r\nmanagers, to contribute towards the cost of fire insurance taken\r\n\r\nup  by  HDB  for common areas of the residential and  commercial\r\n\r\nproperties in their towns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also includes consequential amendments to effect\r\n\r\nall the above changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the idea of Town Councils was first  started  in\r\n\r\n1986  as  a pilot project.  In 1989, the Town Councils  Act  was\r\n\r\npassed  and many town councils were established.  They gradually\r\n\r\ntook  over  the  management, repair and  maintenance  of  common\r\n\r\nproperty  from  HDB.  At the moment, there are 16 town  councils\r\n\r\nall over Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years of hard work, the town councils have\r\n\r\nmatured.   Now,  apart  from maintenance and  repair  of  common\r\n\r\nproperty,  town  councils also organise various   activities  to\r\n\r\neducate the residents to keep their estates clean with the  hope\r\n\r\nthat  they  will cooperate with the town councils  to  create  a\r\n\r\nbetter and cleaner environment for everyone.  This will also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhelp  to enhance the social cohesion by inculcating in them  the\r\n\r\n\"kampong spirit\" for harmonious community living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through various community activities, the town councils,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  grassroots  organisations  and  the  CDCs,  have\r\n\r\nidentified themselves with the people and have also served as  a\r\n\r\nbridge  between the people and the Government.  When the country\r\n\r\nis in crisis, the Government and the people will be able to work\r\n\r\ntogether  to  tide  over the difficult time.   The  Government's\r\n\r\nrecent  $10.5  billion  package  of  cost-cutting  measures  has\r\n\r\nreceived  resounding support by the people. We  hope  that  this\r\n\r\ntripartite  cooperation  package  will  show  good  results   to\r\n\r\novercome our economic difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must encourage our town councils, grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  and  CDCs to carry on organising  more  community\r\n\r\nactivities so as to further enhance our social cohesion.  On the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the  grassroots leaders  need  proper  places  and\r\n\r\nfacilities  to  organise their activities.  There  are  reserved\r\n\r\nvacant  lands which are now in the charge of HDB.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  suggested  that  this  should be transferred  to  the  town\r\n\r\ncouncils  for  maintenance  and  management.   This  is  a  good\r\n\r\ndecision. These vacant lands scattered all over the various  HDB\r\n\r\nestates  can provide more space for grassroots leaders and  town\r\n\r\ncouncils  to  organise  their  community  activities,  such   as\r\n\r\nNational  Day  dinners, the Senior Citizens' Week  celebrations,\r\n\r\nTown  Council  Day  and  Residents'  Day.   This  will  play  an\r\n\r\nimportant role in enhancing our social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in order to give more effect to the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of the new amendments, I have three  suggestions\r\n\r\nfor the Minister to consider.  Town Councils should be given the\r\n\r\nauthority  to  use  the  Town  Council  Development   Fund   for\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and  management  of  the  vacant  land.   In   this\r\n\r\nconnection, the Bill must authorise the town councils to collect\r\n\r\nland-use  and  temporary licence fees from  organisations  which\r\n\r\napply to use these lands.  The Ministry may want to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsider having the vacant lands included in the IUP and MUP  to\r\n\r\nprovide residents with a better living environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must first of\r\n\r\nall  declare my interest in this Bill.  I am the Chairman of the\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir Town Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments to the Town Councils Act contain in\r\n\r\nthis Bill are controversial.  The Government seems to be blowing\r\n\r\nhot and cold at the same time.  I would like to cite examples of\r\n\r\nwhat  happened at Potong Pasir.  Whenever the Potong Pasir  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil attempts to install a new facility in a building  or  do\r\n\r\nanything on the land, the HDB shall step in and refuse  to  give\r\n\r\nits consent on grounds that it is the owner of all HDB buildings\r\n\r\nand  lands  on  which  those  buildings  are  sited.   The  true\r\n\r\nsituation in Potong Pasir Constituency is that the Town  Council\r\n\r\nthere cannot even knock a single nail in any building in an  HDB\r\n\r\nestate  without  first getting permission  from  the  HDB.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  therefore  we  ask is: what  is  the  status  of  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils?  Do we have the right to do things independently?  The\r\n\r\nanswer  is yes and no.  As far as the day-to-day running of  the\r\n\r\nTown  Council is concerned, we have some measure of independence\r\n\r\nof  action, but even that is whittled down by the amendment that\r\n\r\nis  before  us.  Basically, as I see it, the Town  Councils  are\r\n\r\nnothing  more  than  agents of the HDB.   We  are  cleaning  and\r\n\r\nproperty managing agents.  That is what we are, although we  are\r\n\r\ngiven a glorified name of a Town Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Potong Pasir Town Council has taken the HDB to court on\r\n\r\nthe  interpretation of section 19 of the Town Councils Act,  and\r\n\r\nthe  court ruled that the HDB is the property owner and we  need\r\n\r\nto   seek  its  permission  to  install  new  facilities.   Only\r\n\r\nrecently,  the  HDB and the Potong Pasir CDC jointly  put  up  a\r\n\r\nnotice  board  on a land under the jurisdiction  of  the  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  Town  Council.  For any other body which does that,  that\r\n\r\nparty  would  have  to  seek our Town Council's  permission  and\r\n\r\nobtain  a  TOL  for doing so.  But when the HDB and  the  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir CDC put up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuch  a notice board, they blatantly bypassed us with arrogance,\r\n\r\nbecause  they did not even, as a matter of courtesy, inform  the\r\n\r\nTown  Council  of what they were doing.  The Potong  Pasir  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil, of course, took the notice board down.  But soon after,\r\n\r\nwe  received a threatening letter from the HDB claiming that  it\r\n\r\nis  the  owner of the land and has the right to erect  a  notice\r\n\r\nboard on that land.  The Potong Pasir Town Council did not  want\r\n\r\nto  confront the HDB in court again, so we re-erected the notice\r\n\r\nboard  at  its original place, which is land under our care  and\r\n\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the amendment under clause 2, the HDB now wants\r\n\r\nthe  Town Council to pay for premiums for the insurance it takes\r\n\r\nup  for fire risk in relation to the common property.  No doubt,\r\n\r\nunder  the  Town  Councils  Act, all common  properties  at  HDB\r\n\r\nestates  are  under  the  control and  management  of  the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils,  but  still  the  HDB is the  owner  of  those  common\r\n\r\nproperties,  as it has claimed whenever its rights of  ownership\r\n\r\nare  infringed.  Normally, it is the owner of the building  that\r\n\r\ntakes up the insurance policy against fire risk.  And even under\r\n\r\nthe  Land  Titles  (Strata)  Act (Chapter  158),  which  is  the\r\n\r\nequivalent  law,  it  is the management corporation,  comprising\r\n\r\nsubsidiary proprietors, which is the required body to insure the\r\n\r\nsubdivided  buildings  which in part form the  common  property.\r\n\r\nThe  main difference between the requirement to insure under the\r\n\r\nLand  Titles (Strata) Act and this amendment is that  under  the\r\n\r\nformer  law,  it is the owner of the property or the  subsidiary\r\n\r\nproprietors which are required to insure the property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of HDB flats, when this amendment is passed,\r\n\r\nultimately  it  is the lessees who shall pay for  the  insurance\r\n\r\npremium for the common property.  The lessees are not the owners\r\n\r\nof  that  property.  The Government now wants HDB residents  who\r\n\r\nare not owners of the common property to bear responsibility  of\r\n\r\nthat  property which is not theirs.  The HDB, as  owner  of  the\r\n\r\ncommon  property,  is  shamelessly shirking its  responsibility.\r\n\r\nWhen  it  comes to claiming its right over the common  property,\r\n\r\nthe HDB is doubly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfast   in   doing  so.   But  when  it  comes  to  bearing   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  as  to  the  liabilities,  such  as  paying  for\r\n\r\ninsurance  premium,  the  HDB is now passing  the  duty  to  the\r\n\r\nresidents.  Is this the sort of example the Government wants  to\r\n\r\nset  for  the  people  of  Singapore?  To  tell  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  -  you  can  enjoy  the  benefits  but  abandon   the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and liabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clause 3(b), I would say that the determination\r\n\r\nof  the  rates of the conservancy and service charges should  be\r\n\r\nleft to the Town Council and not to the Minister.  The way I see\r\n\r\nit,  the Government wants a hand in it.  Because, as regards the\r\n\r\nservice and conservancy charges, the Government wants to squeeze\r\n\r\nas  much political advantage out of them as possible.  With this\r\n\r\namendment,  the  Government can control how much  the  residents\r\n\r\nshould  pay for their S&CC.  The Government subsidises the  S&CC\r\n\r\nof  the  HDB residents out of the goods and services tax  (GST).\r\n\r\nThe  Government knows how much GST it has collected and how much\r\n\r\nof  it  can be disbursed so as to achieve a position of  revenue\r\n\r\nneutral,  as  far as the GST is concerned.  It is all  a  clever\r\n\r\njuggling of money.  The Government collects from the people.  It\r\n\r\ncollects the GST on the one hand and disburses them as subsidies\r\n\r\nto the HDB flat dwellers on the other.  The only problem is that\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of people who pay for the GST are HDB  residents.\r\n\r\nThey  comprise 85% of Singaporeans.  They pay taxes out of their\r\n\r\npockets on the one hand for goods and services they consume and,\r\n\r\non  the  other  hand, they get back in terms of S&CC  subsidies.\r\n\r\nThe  only problem is that, on average, an HDB resident shall get\r\n\r\nback less than what he pays out in GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear to me that the amendment under clause 3(d)\r\n\r\nis  a  conflict with section 3 of the Town Councils Act (Chapter\r\n\r\n329A).  Under that section, the Town Councils are constituted to\r\n\r\ncontrol,  manage,  maintain and improve the common  property  of\r\n\r\nresidential  property  in HDB housing  estates.   The  amendment\r\n\r\nallows the Town Council to pay for improvements which are not in\r\n\r\nthe  common property.  In principle, this is wrong.  What I  was\r\n\r\ngoing to say is:  why\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould the majority of residents pay to improve the property  of\r\n\r\na  citizen who may or may not be a resident in HDB flats for his\r\n\r\nsole  benefit?  But now I am told that what the Government wants\r\n\r\nis  for  the Town Council to pay for facilities that are put  up\r\n\r\nthrough  CIPC funds by the CCC.  Again, I think that  is  wrong.\r\n\r\nIf the CCC can put up any facility or any community works, then,\r\n\r\nI  think it is up to the CCC to maintain it.  Of course, if  the\r\n\r\nTown  Councils  were  told and if they agree  to  put  up  those\r\n\r\nfacilities, maybe there is a moral duty to pay.  But if the  CCC\r\n\r\nputs  up such facilities, like in our Potong Pasir Town Council,\r\n\r\nthey put up some signages in Sennett Estate, which we were never\r\n\r\ntold, I do not think the Town Council at Potong Pasir should  be\r\n\r\nmade liable to maintain those facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this amendment is allowed, there shall be a loophole for\r\n\r\nfavouritism and even cronyism.  I do not think that  this  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  amendment.  If the amendment is to be allowed at  all,  it\r\n\r\nshould be left to the Town Council to have the last say and  not\r\n\r\nthe  Minister.  It is cronyism because, under section 3  of  the\r\n\r\nTown  Councils  Act, it allows the Town Council  only  to  spend\r\n\r\nmoney  to  maintain,  manage  common  property.   But  now  this\r\n\r\namendment is going to allow the Town Council to manage  and  pay\r\n\r\nout  of Town Councils' funds for properties which are not in the\r\n\r\ncommon areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to also comment on clause 4 of the Bill.\r\n\r\nSince  the Town Councils Act was formed about 10 years ago,  the\r\n\r\nTown Councils have always levied service and conservancy charges\r\n\r\nat  one  rate for one type of flats, shops or stalls.   This  is\r\n\r\npursuant  to  the  present section 38 of the Town  Councils  Act\r\n\r\nwhich  clearly  states that the Town Council can levy  different\r\n\r\nrates  for  different types of residential, commercial  property\r\n\r\nand  stalls  and also in respect of their uses.   Now  all  this\r\n\r\nseemingly  is to be changed.  If I read the amendment correctly,\r\n\r\nthe  Town Councils are allowed, after this amendment, to  charge\r\n\r\ndifferent rates for, say, 3-room or 4-room flats.  The amendment\r\n\r\nalso mentions something new, that is, a class\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof owners.  Nowhere in the main Act does it mention the class of\r\n\r\nowners of flats.  This is appearing in the new subsection (10A):\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (10), a Town\r\n\r\nCouncil  may  differentiate the rates of charges  to  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  any  grants-in-aid  made under  section  41  which  are\r\n\r\nexpressed  to  be  for the benefit of any  class  of  owners  of\r\n\r\nflats.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something new. Because this new class of owners of\r\n\r\nflats  is  never mentioned in the Town Councils Act.  So  really\r\n\r\nthis amendment is not very clear to me.  Maybe the Minister  can\r\n\r\nexplain further.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the two\r\n\r\nMembers,  Mr  Ang Mong Seng and Mr Chiam See Tong,  for  raising\r\n\r\nrelevant queries.  I want to thank all the Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nwho  are  still sitting around and listening carefully  at  this\r\n\r\nhour of the day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng raised three points. The first is whether we\r\n\r\ncould  allow  Town Councils not just to repair and maintain  but\r\n\r\nalso to manage vacant land.  I think there is a misunderstanding\r\n\r\nhere  but  I  will clarify later on.  The second  point  Mr  Ang\r\n\r\nraised was to allow Town Councils to issue TOLs for use of  such\r\n\r\nvacant  lands  so that Town Councils can collect  the  fees  for\r\n\r\nfunctions  held  on  non-common property.  The  third  point  he\r\n\r\nraised  was  whether  we would allow IUP and  MUP  funds  to  be\r\n\r\nextended to works on non-common property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Town Councils Act was enacted on 29th June 1988, the\r\n\r\nobjective was, and still is today, to control, maintain,  manage\r\n\r\nand  improve  the common property.  That has not  changed.   But\r\n\r\nover  the years, some things have changed.  For example, we have\r\n\r\nIUPs,  we  have extensive use of CIPC funds.  On rare occasions,\r\n\r\nwill  the  CCCs seek permission to fund a project from a  common\r\n\r\nproperty to a non-common property?  For example, a short linkway\r\n\r\nfrom  a  HDB block to a bus stop.  That linkway crosses  from  a\r\n\r\ncommon property to a non-common property, ie, crosses into State\r\n\r\nland.  In these circumstances, funds are available for the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil, acting on behalf of the CCC, to build the linkway using\r\n\r\nIUP or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCIPC  funds.  But the Town Council could not maintain or  manage\r\n\r\nthe part of the linkway which stands on non-common property.  So\r\n\r\nthis  Bill serves to allow Town Councils certain flexibility  to\r\n\r\nuse  the operating funds to maintain and manage the facility  on\r\n\r\nnon-common property.  It is not, as Mr Ang misunderstood it,  to\r\n\r\nmanage the non-common property land itself.  The land belongs to\r\n\r\nthe  State.   HDB is made an agent of the State.  We are  saying\r\n\r\nthat  we  allow  the Town Councils to use the money  to  repair,\r\n\r\nmaintain,  improve and even replace those facilities that  stand\r\n\r\non  non-common  property.  So I think that is quite  clear  now.\r\n\r\nBut  I  will take up Mr Ang's suggestion and ask HDB  to  liaise\r\n\r\nwith Land Office and see what we can do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to clarify is that the non-common\r\n\r\nproperty  land usually belongs to the State, which  is  reserved\r\n\r\nland, and the State will have some use for the land in the  long\r\n\r\nterm.  So it would be difficult for the Government to allow Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  to manage the land.  I hope those points will  clarify\r\n\r\nMr Ang's queries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to Mr Chiam See Tong. Mr Chiam is very suspicious.\r\n\r\nHe thinks that this Bill is to fix him.  Far from it, it is not.\r\n\r\nBecause  what  fixes  him,  fixes all  the  other  14  PAP  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils.   So we are actually suffering more than him.   But  I\r\n\r\nwill  go  through some of his points.  First, he  said  that  we\r\n\r\ntreat him differently.  In fact, the treatment is the same.   If\r\n\r\nany  PAP  Town  Council wants to do any permanent  work  on  the\r\n\r\ncommon property, it has to seek the land owner's, which is  HDB,\r\n\r\npermission  to  do so.  Usually, HDB does not say  no,  provided\r\n\r\ncertain  conditions are complied and provided the  Town  Council\r\n\r\nfunds  the  project.  So this applies to him at the  same  time.\r\n\r\nThe  recent incident which he brought up was when he  put  up  a\r\n\r\nsignboard without seeking permission from HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You put up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> But you took it down.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Anything that stands on HDB land belongs to\r\n\r\nHDB.  You are not supposed to remove, paint or vandalise it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBut  it  is  a  small incident.  We have to enforce it  legally.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it will become a precedent.  If he wants  to  put  up\r\n\r\nany  signboard, he can just write to HDB.  And if they  are  not\r\n\r\nobjectionable, I do not see any reason why he cannot put  it  on\r\n\r\nGovernment land.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I seek a clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The land is under our jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe land is part of the common property in which we have control\r\n\r\nand we have management of it.  Therefore, if anyone wants to put\r\n\r\nanything  on that land, he should seek our permission.   But  in\r\n\r\nthe  case of HDB and CDC, they did not bother.  They brushed  us\r\n\r\naside  and went ahead and put it up.  The next morning we saw  a\r\n\r\nstrange board there.  Naturally, we took it down.  We even  have\r\n\r\na  by-law  to say that if anybody wants to put anything  on  the\r\n\r\nland under our control, he should seek our permission.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> In that particular incident, the CCC did\r\n\r\nseek  the  permission  of HDB but they did  not  seek  the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil's permission because it is the managing agent,  but  not\r\n\r\nthe  landlord.   So that is the technical legal point  which  he\r\n\r\nconceded and he put back the signboard.  Anyway, that is  not  a\r\n\r\nvery  serious  allegation he has made.   There  are  other  more\r\n\r\nserious ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the insurance of common property, he said that it goes\r\n\r\nagainst the spirit of the Town Council.  He said that the common\r\n\r\nproperty  belongs  to  HDB,  so HDB  should  insure  the  common\r\n\r\nproperty  and  not  ask the Town Council to share  this  premium\r\n\r\nburden.   Over the last few years, from 1991 to 1997,  the  fire\r\n\r\nclaims  had  gone  up almost two-fold, from  about  $315,000  to\r\n\r\n$776,000.   A  lot of the fires were actually caused  by  debris\r\n\r\ncollected  in the common areas, like lift lobbies and corridors,\r\n\r\nand  the  debris should have been removed by the Town  Councils.\r\n\r\nIt  is  due  to the negligence of the Town Councils  that  these\r\n\r\nfires  were started in the first place.  There is a moral hazard\r\n\r\nhere.  If we do not ask the Town Councils to bear a part of  the\r\n\r\npremium, then the Town Councils will not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nremove the debris diligently.  No doubt, the Town Councils  have\r\n\r\nno control over who throws the debris, but nonetheless it is the\r\n\r\nduty  of  the  Town Council, as the managing agent  of  HDB,  to\r\n\r\nremove  the debris whenever they occur.  There is a moral hazard\r\n\r\nthere.   If we do not ask the Town Councils to pay part  of  the\r\n\r\npremium,  they will just sit back, take it easy, and more  fires\r\n\r\nwill take place and the premiums will snowball.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When HDB insures the Town Councils against fire risks, HDB\r\n\r\ninsures it board-wide, that means, it will take up insurance for\r\n\r\nall  the common property owned by HDB.  It does not discriminate\r\n\r\nagainst  certain  Town Councils.  It does not ask  certain  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  to be a bit more diligent or pay more.  We think  that\r\n\r\nthat  is  wrong.   From now onwards, we look at individual  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil and say, \"If you are more responsible, if you clear  the\r\n\r\ndebris quickly and if there are less fire incidents in your Town\r\n\r\nCouncil, we will ask you to pay less or maybe even nothing.\"  If\r\n\r\nthere are a lot of fires in a particular Town Council, the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil has been negligent in clearing all the debris and  fires\r\n\r\nkeep  on  occurring  at the same few blocks,  then  we  have  to\r\n\r\npenalise that Town Council.  We have not worked out the exact co-payment part.  But we will make sure that it would be equitable,\r\n\r\ntransparent and affordable, and I can come here and  defend  it.\r\n\r\nSo  I  hope  he is convinced that we are not going after  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir Town Council.  The culprits could be a PAP Town Council, I\r\n\r\nreally do not know.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On S&C charges, Mr Chiam See Tong said that S&C charges\r\n\r\nshould be left to the Town Councils.  That is what it is.  It is\r\n\r\nup to him to levy X$ for 3-room type, Y$ for 4-room type, and Z$\r\n\r\nfor 5-room type.  And we have not changed that principle.  It is\r\n\r\nup  to him.  We do not tell him how much to charge.  What we  do\r\n\r\nis  to  give  him the flexibility to charge different  types  of\r\n\r\nrates on the same type of flats.  Let me give an example.   When\r\n\r\nthe  Town  Councils Act was enacted, we thought that  the  older\r\n\r\nflats  would cost more to maintain.  So we gave more  grants  to\r\n\r\nHDB.  HDB gave more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngrants to Town Councils for older flats.  But over the years, we\r\n\r\nfind that when we upgrade an old flat, let us say, an upgraded 3-room flat, the cost of upgrading and maintenance goes up because\r\n\r\nwe  put  in more lifts, faster lifts, more landscaping and  more\r\n\r\nlighting points.  So it would cost more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I clarify, Mr Deputy Speaker?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Koo, are you giving way?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am saying that the Minister has the\r\n\r\nlast  say.   The  Minister may, from time to time,  prescribe  a\r\n\r\nminimum amount of the service and conservancy charges which  are\r\n\r\npaid,  or are due and payable, or both, to a Town Council  under\r\n\r\nsection  38.   So  the  amount  is actually  determined  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.   The Minister will say, \"Look, you cannot  charge  at\r\n\r\nthis  rate.  You must charge at another rate.\" because he  feels\r\n\r\nthat that is the minimum rate he should charge.  So the S&CC  is\r\n\r\nfinally  the  Minister's decision.  It is not the Town  Council,\r\n\r\nunless I am wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> I think you are wrong there. I think you\r\n\r\nhave read the part on the sinking fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Okay, you may be right there.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> So he is convinced that we are giving\r\n\r\nTown  Councils the flexibility of charging different  rates  for\r\n\r\nthe same flat type because we find that upgraded flats cost more\r\n\r\nto  maintain  than  older  flats.  We also  recognise  that  for\r\n\r\ndifferent  group of flats, for example, we have standard  4-room\r\n\r\nflats,  4-room  design-and-build flats  and  4-room  design-plus\r\n\r\nflats, the design-plus and design-and-build flats actually  cost\r\n\r\nmore to maintain than a normal standard 4-room flat because they\r\n\r\nare  more  luxurious and have more landscaping and  things  like\r\n\r\nthat.   Whether  the  Town Council wishes  to  charge  different\r\n\r\nrates, we leave it to the Town Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he mentioned about sinking fund, we find that some\r\n\r\nTown Councils are less than diligent in collecting their arrears\r\n\r\nfrom  the  residents.  In other words, if they are  supposed  to\r\n\r\ncollect  Y$  from  the residents per month in  S&CC,  they  only\r\n\r\ncollect X$, so they have a shortfall.  What they do is they send\r\n\r\na  portion of the X$ into the sinking fund.  We find the sinking\r\n\r\nfund  is growing very slowly.  We fear that when the time  comes\r\n\r\nfor  cyclical upgrading, like re-roofing or changing  of  lifts,\r\n\r\nthere  may not be enough money in the sinking fund.  This  comes\r\n\r\nabout  because the MPs may want to be popular and  may  be  less\r\n\r\nthan  diligent and he may not want to antagonise the  residents.\r\n\r\nSo  we want the Town Councils to now reflect the arrears portion\r\n\r\nin  the  financial statements.  So the residents and the  public\r\n\r\nwill  know  that there is a significant amount of arrears  which\r\n\r\nwere  not  collected and that amount should go into the  sinking\r\n\r\nfund.  In other words, we are going for a collectible system and\r\n\r\nthe  accounting  should be in an accrual system.

Hence,  on\r\n\r\neach  passing, a deduction of an appropriate ERP charge will  be\r\n\r\nmade.  When  a  motorist passes an ERP gantry with  no  CashCard\r\n\r\ninserted  in the In-vehicle Unit (IU), a violation is deemed  to\r\n\r\nhave been committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scheme whereby a motorist can make up for any earlier\r\n\r\nviolation  by re-passing under an ERP gantry within a  specified\r\n\r\ntime  will generate unnecessary traffic circulation on the roads\r\n\r\nin  the  vicinity of the ERP gantries.

The  COE  thus\r\n\r\nrepresents  the right for a vehicle owner to use his vehicle  on\r\n\r\nthe roads for a period of 10 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an owner feels that his vehicle is in good condition and\r\n\r\nwishes to use it beyond 10 years, he can revalidate the COE upon\r\n\r\nits expiry for either 5 or 10 years by paying 50% or 100% of the\r\n\r\nprevailing quota premium respectively.  It would not be fair for\r\n\r\nthe Government to extend the COE validity for vehicles tested to\r\n\r\nbe in good condition to 15 years when the owners only paid for a\r\n\r\n10-year COE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to extend the validity period of all COEs, we can\r\n\r\nexpect the quota premium to be higher as a higher value will  be\r\n\r\nattached to the longer life-span.  In addition, if COEs were  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  longer validity of say 15 or 20 years, the total number\r\n\r\nof COEs that can be released will have to be reduced.  A reduced\r\n\r\nCOE  quota  is again likely to lead to higher premiums.   Higher\r\n\r\nCOE  premiums will not only have an adverse impact on those  who\r\n\r\nare  revalidating their COEs, but will also put the new  vehicle\r\n\r\nbuyers at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Parliamentary Committee (Communications) is in\r\n\r\nthe  midst  of  reviewing the different aspects of  the  Vehicle\r\n\r\nQuota  System.

Over the last  10\r\n\r\nyears, the percentage of female doctors who were not working  or\r\n\r\nworking only part-time ranged from about 16% to nearly 19%.  The\r\n\r\ncomparative figure for male doctors is 5% to 8%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two key reasons for imposing the intake quota on\r\n\r\nfemale  medical  students.   First, the  cost  of  training  one\r\n\r\nmedical  student  is  much  higher  than  that  for  the   other\r\n\r\ndisciplines  in the university.  It costs over $350,000  over  5\r\n\r\nyears to train a medical student, 80% of which is subsidised  by\r\n\r\nthe Government.  The total subsidy for medical students is about\r\n\r\n5  times  that  for  students in other disciplines.   Given  the\r\n\r\nlimited intake of medical students and the need to optimise  the\r\n\r\noutcome,  a  higher  proportion of male  medical  students  will\r\n\r\nensure  that more doctors will remain full time in the workforce\r\n\r\nto meet the projected demand for medical services and contribute\r\n\r\nto society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that a higher proportion of female doctors\r\n\r\nprefer  to  work  in  positions which do not  involve  irregular\r\n\r\nworking  hours.  Such positions are very limited in  our  health\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equal access to education remains one of our cardinal\r\n\r\nprinciples.   Women make up 52% of the local university  student\r\n\r\npopulation  in the 1998/1999 intake.  Equal access to university\r\n\r\neducation does not mean that every student has a free choice  as\r\n\r\nto  the type of course he or she may pursue, as this depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  number of places available for each course.  The number  of\r\n\r\navailable places depends on several considerations, such as  our\r\n\r\nnational  needs and the economic cost of providing such courses.\r\n\r\nWith  respect  to  medical education,  our  economic  and  human\r\n\r\nresources  do  not  allow us the luxury of providing  a  medical\r\n\r\neducation  to  all  for its own sake.  For  these  reasons,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  imposed  the one-third  quota  in  the  medical\r\n\r\ncourse.   However,  we  do  not regard  this  policy  to  be  in\r\n\r\nviolation   of  our  obligations  under  CEDAW.    It   is   not\r\n\r\ndiscrimination against women on grounds of gender per se.  It is\r\n\r\nbecause we have to address a real and practical problem.  Let me\r\n\r\nalso add the Government does not prevent women from enrolling in\r\n\r\nmedical courses overseas and qualifying as doctors.

At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  it allows the civil service to  better  reward\r\n\r\nofficers who have performed well. The performance bonus is  part\r\n\r\nof the total annual salary that an officer receives. The quantum\r\n\r\nof  performance  bonuses  paid vary according  to  the  assessed\r\n\r\nperformance  and substantive grade of the officer.  The  maximum\r\n\r\nquantum  of  performance bonus payable for the top grades  is  9\r\n\r\nmonths for the Legal Service and 6 months or less for all  other\r\n\r\ncivil servants and political appointment holders. However, fewer\r\n\r\nthan  5%  of  officers are paid the top tier  bonus  rate.   The\r\n\r\nmajority  receive the base rate, which varies depending  on  the\r\n\r\ngrade and service of the officer.

Pupils have developed a stronger sense\r\n\r\nof belonging and bonding to the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, our objective in starting CIP is being achieved. The\r\n\r\nCIP coupled with other community service activities conducted by\r\n\r\nschools  provides  our  young with good  exposure  to  community\r\n\r\nservice and involvement. As the Programme is relatively new,  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  allowed  to  run for a few years  before  we  assess\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is a need to make any changes to the  number  of\r\n\r\nhours required.\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
