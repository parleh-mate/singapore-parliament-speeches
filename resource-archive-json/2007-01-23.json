As the majority of voters in Potong Pasir did not support this plan, the PAP candidate did not have the mandate to pursue his proposal with the Government.&nbsp; Hence, there was no need for the Government to set aside any budget for it.&nbsp; I believe the Potong Pasir voters agreed with Mr Chiam See Tong's statement that \"over a five-year term, he would be able to upgrade all 40 blocks\"&nbsp; using his Town Council funds.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, let me reiterate that the Government is committed to provide lift upgrading to all eligible blocks by 2014, including those in Potong Pasir.&nbsp; As part of this plan, Town Councils are allowed to use up to 10% of its sinking fund to carry out lift upgrading in blocks where the upgrading cost does not exceed $5,000 per benefiting unit.&nbsp; Many Town Councils have submitted proposals to do so.&nbsp; I note that to date, my Ministry has not received any such proposals from the Potong Pasir Town Council.&nbsp; This is in spite of Mr Chiam's electoral promise to carry out lift upgrading in Potong Pasir using his Town Council funds.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As he is actually eligible for a HDB concessionary loan and will have some proceeds from the sale of his repossessed flat, HDB advised him to consider buying a smaller flat.&nbsp; He could also consider staying with his siblings or at temporary shelters run by VWOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;He declined to take up any of these suggestions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on these facts, Sir, I believe you will agree with me that these two cases were homeless by choice, rather than due to circumstances beyond their control.&nbsp; The individuals may have spent their sale proceeds irresponsibly or decided that the <p align=left>Column: 1116<p>other housing options are not sufficiently attractive to them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have stated on various occasions in this House, HDB is prepared to help genuinely needy cases to rent or buy a flat from HDB.&nbsp; However, such appeals need to be carefully scrutinised to ensure that our limited housing subsidies are fairly distributed to those that need them most and are not abused. Individual homeowners must understand the implications of their decision to buy and sell their flats and take personal responsibility for these decisions.&nbsp; Although social services may also be offered to those genuinely in need, on a temporary basis, the Government cannot repeatedly provide assistance and subsidies to bail out financially irresponsible households, as it will only encourage such behaviour and deprive deserving families of help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On its part, HDB will also provide financial counselling to help potential flat buyers better understand the long-term financial implications of their flat purchases. Starting from this year, HDB will require those applying for HDB loans to obtain a Home Loan Eligibility letter before they commit to a flat purchase.&nbsp; This is another measure by HDB to inculcate financial prudence and forward planning among flat buyers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Such measures would also help them to face the effects and&nbsp;at the same time, help them to rise again in the near future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman--><p align=left>Column: 1117<p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</B>:&nbsp; Sir, we recognise that when families are faced with such crisis situation, they need support.&nbsp; Often times, it is very difficult to make a decision on the kind of support that is to be given to such families.&nbsp; As far as options are available, I think there are several options that are already in place.&nbsp; Certainly one is the subsidised rental flats that are available.&nbsp; And we look at the eligibility criteria and conditions of the family to see whether they are eligible or we can waive some of these conditions to help them.&nbsp; Secondly,&nbsp;it is the market rate rental that is available to some of these families.&nbsp; But the third option, which is an option that very few families tend to fall back on, is really the option of their own extended families.&nbsp; We have to recognise the fact that, at the end of the day, if, as a society, we want to uphold the policy or the value that the family is the first line of defence, we must take a look at where the families are in supporting some of these households who are actually in need at the point in time.&nbsp; Often times, when we look at the individual cases, there&nbsp;is family support that is available and we explore with them, but they tend to not want to go back to the family for support.&nbsp; It is not easy to actually give support at that point in time because there are a lot of conditions that we have to look at and there are a lot of issues that we have to address.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I think, what is more important also at the end of the day is to look at upstream measures to try to prevent some of these families from getting into such difficulties.&nbsp; One of the issues we realise is that families do not respond early enough when the banks start coming to them for payments.&nbsp; They often wait till the very end before they respond.&nbsp; We need to try to educate some of these families to make sure that they acknowledge the problems that they face and come forward when the banks start taking action against them.&nbsp; Secondly, it is to ensure that families are aware of implications of the <p align=left>Column: 1118<p>actions that they take.&nbsp; When they take loans from the banks, for example, they must be aware of the financial policies that these banks operate in.&nbsp; We need to try to make sure that they understand the implications of this action that they take.&nbsp; Often times, most of these families take the bank loans without understanding what it means, when the rates will go up, and what happens after that.&nbsp; More importantly, what we are trying to do now is for HDB to try to educate these families at the onset of purchase. &nbsp;HDB officers will come forward and try to explain to these families that they actually understand what it means for them to take a bank loan and what it means for them should rates go up and, at the same time, HDB is working very closely with the banks to make sure that cases which are at risk of having their flats being repossessed are identified early, so that MCYS and other agencies can come forward to try to help&nbsp;these families.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</B> &nbsp; Sir, we review every case on a case-by-case basis, and that is why it takes some time for us to review those cases.&nbsp; When cases come to us, we have to look at the background,&nbsp;the history of it, and the level of subsidies they have taken.&nbsp; Yes, there are issues of families facing negative equity.&nbsp; But when we look back, many of them would have already had several subsidies and benefited from the subsidies.&nbsp; Often times, it is very difficult for us to make a decision whether we should give them further subsidies with regard to subsidised rental flats.&nbsp; So, it takes a while before we are able to understand the circumstances of each case.&nbsp; Often times, we offer them temporary housing in shelters that are available and run by VWOs.&nbsp; And, often times, these families reject such options. &nbsp;So, whether they choose to take up those options or choose to live in void decks,&nbsp;at the end of the day, is really their choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Often times, when we face these families, the first thing we offer them is really temporary housing through the shelters.&nbsp; And our experience is that these families reject the shelters that are made available to them.&nbsp; Secondly, we explore related families that are available - their brothers and sisters, their siblings.&nbsp; And when we look at the case history,&nbsp;we realise there are family members who have got flats that they can actually accommodate these families, and they reject those options also.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, is it fair for us then to ensure that the Government comes in and gives them the rental flats just because they reject all these other options?&nbsp; But I want to also emphasise in the House that HDB has been very particular in looking at each case and trying to understand the circumstances within each case.&nbsp;

But circumstances change.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not so much an issue of financial planning as the fact that Singapore's economy is very volatile now.&nbsp; So when they sell their flats, the problem is that they have negative equity, they have medical bills to pay, especially if they are old, and the debarment period of 30 months kicks in and they do not get a rental flat.&nbsp;

In harassment cases, caning was introduced for offenders who commit damage to property&nbsp; during the course of harassment.&nbsp; Repeat offenders of harassment were made&nbsp; subject to mandatory caning when hurt to person or damage to property is caused.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Confiscation of assets of UML syndicates</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second,&nbsp;confiscation of assets of UML syndicates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two offences&nbsp; under the Moneylenders Act have been gazetted as predicate offences under Schedule 2 of the Corruption, Drugs Trafficking &amp; Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, or CDSA Act in short, on 9th September 2005.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, unlicensed moneylenders who have been charged and convicted in court for these offences, may have their assets seized and confiscated.&nbsp; The prospect of seizure and confiscation of the assets of illegal moneylenders and their syndicate leaders would make UML more unprofitable and unattractive.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Use of CL(TP) Act against syndicate members</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, Police has invoked the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act to deal with the members of these syndicated UML operations, whenever necessary.&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1126<p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Formation of the Anti-UML Task Force (AUML TF)</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, at the enforcement front, Police formed a dedicated Anti-Unlicensed Moneylending Task Force (AUML Task Force) in the Criminal Investigations Department in July 2005 to take a more focused approach against unlicensed moneylending syndicates, instead of leaving it to individual Divisions to tackle the problem.&nbsp; Last year,&nbsp;a total of 168 ambush operations and&nbsp;nine intelligence-led operations were conducted against UML activities.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from dealing with UML members, the Task Force is also on the look out for errant debtors who end up assisting or abetting UML activities.&nbsp; These acts of abetment include offering their bank accounts to UML operators, or registering for their prepaid SIM cards or other communication lines in their names for use by UML operators.&nbsp; Debtors who take loans from UML syndicates and subsequently sell their property to innocent victims without changing their addresses, can also be charged for offences under the National Registration Act.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Cancellation of the passports of known UML syndicate members</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, let me touch on the passport cancellation policy against ex-UML syndicate leaders, which came into effect on 1st September 2005.&nbsp; By curbing their ability to travel overseas, ex-UML syndicate leaders are prevented from continuing to operate their UML businesses from abroad after their release from prison.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As at December last year, 28 passports have been cancelled.&nbsp; These ex-syndicate leaders would be subjected to a 10-year travel ban commencing from the date of their release from prison or, for <p align=left>Column: 1127<p>those who have been fined only, the date of their conviction.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Installation of CCTVs to deter UML runners from harassing debtors</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then another initiative which we have taken is this collaboration between Police and the Town Councils to install more CCTVs for general crime prevention which also serve to deter and prevent UML harassment activities.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Collaborative efforts with other agencies</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, as part of the comprehensive approach in dealing with this problem, Police has been engaging various external agencies, such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Association&nbsp;Banks&nbsp;of Singapore (ABS), local banks, SingPost, HDB and IRAS to tackle the UML situation from various fronts, by tightening up on procedures and policies to limit the opportunity for exploitation by UML syndicates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Wee also asks about the current procedures in dealing with these UML cases.&nbsp; Presently, upon receiving a report of harassment by unlicensed moneylenders, uniformed police officers will be deployed to perform on-scene investigation.&nbsp; Officers will take photographs of the scene, and record statements and particulars of the witnesses, victims and the alleged borrower, if they are present.&nbsp; Officers will also obtain important evidence, such as debtor's notes and contact numbers, and pass these onto the Anti-UML Task Force, which will carry out further in-depth investigation, gather intelligence and mount operations against UML syndicates.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the success rate in tackling illegal moneylending, let me assure the House that Police is keeping to a very high tempo in its anti-UML enforcement efforts.&nbsp; Due to the secretive nature of the current <I>modus operandi</I> of UML syndicates, extensive intelligence gathering <p align=left>Column: 1128<p>and investigations are needed before we can arrest the perpetrators and bring down the syndicate.&nbsp; It therefore takes time for these efforts to bear fruit.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have, however, managed to achieve some measure of success in dealing with UML syndicates.&nbsp; Last year,&nbsp;2006, 294 persons were arrested for UML offences and harassment-related&nbsp;activities.&nbsp; This is an increase of 11% as compared to the year before in 2005.&nbsp; Also, last year, Police&nbsp;dealt with 39 UML syndicate members under the CL(TP) Act, which is an increase of 63% compared to 24 in 2005.&nbsp; And more importantly, in addition, Police smashed&nbsp;eight syndicates last year, compared to one the year before. And that is the nub because we have to tackle the syndicates so that we go to the source of the problem.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Police will continue to closely monitor the unlawful moneylending situation, partnering the relevant agencies and members of the public to holistically combat the UML problem.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Senior Minister of State for a very comprehensive reply.&nbsp; But I raise this question because I sense the frustration of some of my residents on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them are innocent to the whole affair because they are not actually party to the loan.&nbsp; It seems that the <I>modus operandi</I> of most of these loan sharks is to&nbsp;harass</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>the neighbours, cause damage to property, deface the environment and bring indirect pressure.&nbsp; The problem is that&nbsp;statistics show that the trend is actually deteriorating.&nbsp; We appreciate that a lot of effort&nbsp;has been made.&nbsp; But how fast on the ground can some of these cases be solved and the success&nbsp;highlighted so that people feel safer?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Although this will not solve the problem, it will at least represent an effort on the part of residents to work with the relevant agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My call, therefore, is that, yes, as the illegal moneylenders have geared up, we will also gear up.&nbsp;When we tackle this problem resolutely, we shall overcome.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMME (CEP)--><p align=left>Column: 1129<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMME (CEP):::1134--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMME (CEP)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Plans to promote greater religious tolerance and harmony--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Plans to promote greater religious tolerance and harmony)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</B> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs what plans or programmes does the Ministry have, within the framework of the Community Engagement Programme (CEP), to promote greater religious tolerance and harmony at the grassroots level.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Community Engagement Programme is a long-term effort to ensure that our multi-religious, multi-ethnic society will stay united should a terrorist attack occur in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve this, we need to identify and work with community leaders who will help to ensure calm and unity amongst the different communities in a crisis.&nbsp; We will develop and sustain platforms for these community leaders to interact and forge closer bonds. &nbsp;We will also work with them to develop and validate actionable response plans to manage any communal tension that could arise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the launch of the programme by the Prime Minister in February last year, MHA has worked together with the People's Association and other Ministries overseeing the five&nbsp;community clusters to develop the necessary supporting structures to facilitate the CEP efforts.&nbsp; We have also started engaging the community leaders and putting in place a national CEP response framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me briefly highlight some of these structures.&nbsp; In July last year, the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts set up the Media Emergency Forum.&nbsp; This forum provides a platform for open and frank exchange of views between local senior media editors and the Government on crisis issues.&nbsp; In October, the Ministry of Manpower set up the Tripartite Panel on CEP at Workplaces. &nbsp;This panel, comprising Government, business and union leaders, will reach out to businesses and unions on the importance of maintaining communal harmony at the workplace, especially in the aftermath of a crisis. Also in October, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports formed the National Steering Committee on Racial and <p align=left>Column: 1131<p>Religious Harmony.&nbsp; This is a national platform for ethnic and religious leaders to dialogue, build networks, and formulate strategies to strengthen engagement across ethnic and religious organisations.&nbsp; The National Steering Committee will also chart strategic directions and provide guidance for the reconstituted Inter-Racial Confidence Circles, which will act as the local platforms to lead in building inter-religious and racial understanding and in responding to tensions with religious or racial dimensions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Community Engagement Programme to be sustainable, the key point must be that initiatives must come from the people. &nbsp;It is only when Singaporeans&nbsp;on the ground own these programmes&nbsp;that we can truly unleash the full potential of the CEP.&nbsp; The Government will help to connect people and provide support and resources so that they can sustain these initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past year, it is heartening&nbsp;to see communities answering the Government's call and taking the initiative to organise such activities.&nbsp; I think Members would either know them or know about them or have indeed participated in some of these ground-up activities.&nbsp; In September last year, the Chinese and Malay communities got together to jointly organise a job fair to provide job opportunities and skills upgrading courses for Malay workers.&nbsp; A number of inter-faith events, dialogues and forums have also been held.&nbsp; In this vein, in October last year, PM Lee officiated at the opening of the Harmony Centre at An-Nahdhah Mosque.&nbsp; The Harmony Centre seeks to promote greater inter-faith understanding and bring people of different religions together by hosting exhibitions, seminars and forums.&nbsp; Early this year, an inter-faith forum and dinner was organised jointly by the University Scholars Programme, Ba'alwie Mosque and Inter-Religious Organisation to discuss ways to enhance inter-faith understanding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1132<p>Moving ahead, we will be organising a National Seminar on the Community Engagement Programme for the community leaders from the various clusters. &nbsp;This seminar will help to build bonds between the community leaders across different clusters and familiarise them with the community response plans from other clusters.&nbsp; We will then be conducting a CEP exercise later this year to test and validate these response plans. &nbsp;MHA&nbsp;will be providing more details at the upcoming Committee of Supply debate.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, how would the Minister engage the traditional religious leaders?&nbsp; Already, Muslim <I>ustaz</I> who got involved in the religious rehabilitation group have been labelled Government <I>ustaz</I> by some elements of the Muslim community.&nbsp; This may actually discourage other well-meaning religious leaders from getting involved or identified as part of the Government effort.&nbsp; How can the Ministry mitigate such labelling?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

The issue is this.&nbsp; It is a limited pot.&nbsp; Yesterday, in this House, Members asked whether there was enough, how many members and their Minimum Sum, can they use it for Medisave, but it is still a limited pot.&nbsp; So we need to go back to the origin and the purpose for the CPF, ie, really for their retirement savings first, for their medical and housing.&nbsp; If we extend the use to other issues, I think we will deplete the pot.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the point of view of Singaporeans wanting to upgrade and access to funding, there are a number of avenues that they can go to without having to touch their own CPF.&nbsp; I would be loath to open it up more to liberalise it and, in the process, deplete their funding.&nbsp; I take the point that it is an investment on the part of members and, even though it may be worthwhile, I would prefer for <p align=left>Column: 1136<p>funding to be opened up in other avenues.&nbsp; And indeed we have.&nbsp; For example, under the WDA programme, we give funding for mid-career professionals who want to change their careers, eg, to become nurses or teaching&nbsp;assistants or in&nbsp;IT and finance.&nbsp; We want to expand these courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, these courses are not cheap.&nbsp; For example, a particular conversion course to be&nbsp;nurses&nbsp;costs about $20,000 a year, but it is money well spent.&nbsp; If it enables someone to change his/her career and extend his/her employability, it is worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think this is the route that is preferred, rather than liberalising the CPF scheme, which should be primarily targeted at retirement, medical and housing expenses.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) (for the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance</B>):&nbsp; Sir, the number of income tax arrears incurred in FY 2005/06 was 67,364 cases as at March 2006.&nbsp; This is around 4% of the total number of assessments raised and represented 2.6% of the total value of tax assessed.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore enjoys a high level of tax compliance and a relatively low rate of tax arrears partly because IRAS has made it convenient for taxpayers to firstly file and, secondly, to pay by providing various payment arrangements.&nbsp; About 55% of taxpayers have opted to pay their taxes <p align=left>Column: 1137<p>through monthly instalments using GIRO. In addition, where taxpayers face financial difficulties, IRAS will work with them to increase the number of instalment payments or even to defer tax payments where warranted.&nbsp; By taking into account taxpayers' individual circumstances, IRAS has facilitated tax compliance.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2005, the Ministry of Finance considered switching to a Current Year basis of assessment, ie, having the employer deduct the tax payments from the employees' salaries and remitting it to the tax authorities directly.&nbsp; The reasons were to bring about a better matching of taxpayers' incomes and tax expenditures and to enhance the effectiveness of the tax system as a fiscal stabiliser.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the feedback from the public consultation exercise that was conducted as part of the review was not in favour of switching to a Current Year basis of assessment.&nbsp; Taxpayers had concerns over the practical difficulties in estimating their current year's income in order to pay their taxes upfront, as well as the high compliance costs incurred by businesses and individuals as a result of the periodic filing and the withholding of tax required under the Current Year basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of&nbsp;the feedback, the Ministry of Finance decided not to switch to a Current Year basis.&nbsp; The results of the review were announced in the 2005 Budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, my Ministry is prepared to reconsider this proposal should the reasons for adopting Current Year basis become more compelling in future.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION--><p align=left>Column: 1137<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION:::1140--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; <B>Mr Michael Palmer</B> asked the Minister for Education whether any steps will be taken to improve the standard of pre-school education and whether his Ministry intends to review and, if neces<p align=left>Column: 1138<p>sary, improve the present guidelines issued for pre-schools.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M) (for the Minister for Education)</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 2000, MOE has been taking steps to raise the quality of pre-school education, while maintaining the diversity in the sector. To do this, MOE has been focusing on the following four main areas specifically:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly,&nbsp;improving the quality of pre-school educators.&nbsp; This is the key&nbsp;to quality pre-school education.&nbsp; We must have&nbsp;competent and confident pre-school teachers who are able to design and conduct engaging lessons and stimulating activities for their pupils. As such, MOE has been working with kindergartens to ensure that their teachers upgrade themselves to attain the required professional training and development to enable them to be more effective in the classrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, MOE also provides a&nbsp;kindergarten curriculum framework. The framework establishes the outcomes and goals for pre-school education in Singapore, as well as a set of internationally accepted and established principles of early childhood education. MOE has also disseminated a teachers' resource package to guide kindergartens in designing and conducting a suitable education programme for their pupils.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, conducting workshops and sharing sessions.&nbsp; These were intended for pre-school educators to help them implement the principles of the curriculum framework.&nbsp; The workshops and sharing sessions guide teachers in pedagogical skills such as designing their education programme and profiling their pupils' progress.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lastly, encouraging kindergarten leaders to conduct self-appraisal.&nbsp; This will <p align=left>Column: 1139<p>encourage kindergartens to work towards continual self-improvement. MOE assisted principals to do this by distributing a benchmarking tool called Standards for Kindergartens, and by conducting workshops and sharing sessions on self-appraisal. MOE also established&nbsp;a Kindergarten Manual to advise service providers and practitioners so as to give them a better understanding of the regulatory requirements and guidelines governing the operation of kindergartens.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MOE conducts regular reviews of teaching and learning in pre-schools in Singapore. These reviews inform MOE of the steps it can take to further help kindergartens improve the quality of teaching and learning they provide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the areas MOE is looking into is enhancing the professional quality of the sector, for example, in uplifting teachers' proficiency in the English Language.&nbsp; More details of this initiative will be announced later.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</B>: Sir, can I just find out when the last curriculum review was done?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</B>: Sir, the last curriculum was issued in 2003.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, besides improving the quality of pre-school education, if&nbsp;the Ministry will be looking at how to improve the affordability of pre-school education, particularly for low-income families.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the Government has put in place the Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) to subsidise the fees&nbsp;of eligible kindergartens for children from low-income families. As a criterion, the net household income should be $1,500&nbsp;and <p align=left>Column: 1140<p>below.&nbsp; And the KiFAS provides 75% subsidy of the fees up to a cap of $65.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, for families receiving KiFAS who are assessed of extra need, they can also be given a $200 start-up fund as a grant for attending pre-school.

We had our best ever showing at the 2005 South East Asian (SEA) Games when we returned with 42 golds, 32 silvers, and 55 bronzes. We have also registered our best ever performances at the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games, as you all know,&nbsp; capturing&nbsp;five golds,&nbsp;six silvers, and&nbsp;seven bronzes in Melbourne, and then&nbsp;eight golds,&nbsp;seven silvers, and 12 bronzes in Doha.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building on such encouraging results at these Major Games, our aim is to raise our performance and improve on our achievements at the Olympics in the near future. Towards this aim, the SNOC has initiated a project focusing on the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, where elite athletes in select targeted sports have been identified for enhanced support and development, so that these athletes will reach their peak at the Olympics. The enhanced support includes more overseas training stints, additional coaches, other sports specialists, and so on.&nbsp; The efforts will be athlete-centred and will build on our existing Sports Excellence initiative.&nbsp; This&nbsp;initiative would dovetail into the <p align=left>Column: 1145<p>recommendations of the Sporting Culture Committee that I am chairing so that we can develop a sustained delivery system for champion athletes in the long term .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS and the Singapore Totalisator Board would&nbsp;support the SNOC by providing funding for this project. This project would cost $7 million.&nbsp; MCYS would provide $2 million and the Singapore Totalisator Board would contribute $5 million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's only Olympic medal was won by our weightlifter Tan Howe Liang in 1960 in Rome. Since then, while we have, on a few occasions, come close to securing our second Olympic medal,&nbsp;we have not been able to do so. Now that our sports excellence systems are in place, we will make a strong push in&nbsp;the next two Olympic Games in Beijing and then in London. If we succeed, it will be a proud moment to remember for the sports fraternity and for all Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to use Mandarin to address some of the key points.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

At the recent Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC) in 2006, which is the equivalent of the Asian Games, our disabled athletes returned with seven golds,&nbsp;five silvers and&nbsp;five bronzes. This was an improvement over the previous FESPIC in 2001 when they won three golds, two silvers and four bronzes. We also have a potential <p align=left>Column: 1149<p>Paralympics medallist in Theresa Goh, who recently claimed a world champion title in the 200 metres Individual Medley at the 2006 International Paralympic Committee (IPC) World Swimming Championships.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC) is the national agency that champions disabled sports. MCYS&nbsp;and the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) support the SDSC in its drive to promote sports excellence among the disabled. Our various sports excellence strategies and support schemes are open to both able-bodied and disabled athletes. For instance, swimmer Theresa Goh is able to balance her career and sports training at Standard Chartered Bank due to SSC's Programme for Elite Athletes Career (PEAC). PEAC helps athletes integrate into the workplace by assisting in the planning, organisation and management of an athlete&rsquo;s career in collaboration with corporate organisations, National Sports Associations (NSAs) and SSC.&nbsp; So we do not just take care of the sports but the after-sports career as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you may also recall the front page news in the <I>Straits Times</I> on 12th January reporting that the Sports School has admitted its first disabled student Khristine Quek and has provisions to take in more disabled students. This is in line with my Ministry's philosophy of inclusiveness and opportunities for all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, we aim to build on our success at FESPIC and better our achievement at the Paralympics. We will also continue to explore new ways to highlight the achievements of our athletes, so that they can inspire their fellow Singaporeans and serve as role models for our youth.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Sin Boon Ann</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I am gratified to learn from the Parliamentary Secretary <p align=left>Column: 1150<p>that the Government supports both able-bodied and disabled athletes equally.&nbsp; My question to the Parliamentary Secretary is whether the financial incentives that they give are also equal and in the way we reward them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Ser Luck:</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, if we are comparing the award for the disabled athletes with those of the Multi-million dollar Award Programme (MAP), and those are supported by the Singapore Tote Board and also the private sector (APP), I believe that SDSC has also approached similar organisations and has also gotten support.&nbsp; The level of competition and the intensity may be different but we still want to recognise the efforts and hard work of these disabled athletes regardless, because they have performed, they have trained hard and they are passionate individuals, and we want to support them.

But what we should identify is that they are all passionate individuals, leaders of their sports and they are out to inspire others.&nbsp; As far as the Ministry's position is concerned, we recognise their efforts.&nbsp; In terms of narrowing the gaps, I think this is where the athletes and the associations have to work together and see what kind of support they can get from the private sector and from Tote Board and the other organisations that have been sponsoring the able-bodied athletes so far.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope SDSC, whatever support they need, whether it is within the sports training or after-sports career, as a Ministry, we fully support and recognise it.&nbsp; It is not just dollars and cents.&nbsp; It is what you can provide for the athletes and how you can give them the recognition.&nbsp; For a champion in sports, it goes beyond just monetary achievements.&nbsp; It is about achieving the best that they can and that&nbsp;in itself, we must give the recognition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The Ministry as well as the Health Promotion Board&nbsp;are monitoring the situation of trans fat in our food supply and&nbsp;consumption pattern, and we will evaluate if we should impose more <p align=left>Column: 1154<p>stringent measures against trans fats usage.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, if you look at other countries in the world, only Denmark has used legislation to limit the trans fat content of oil used in food and they limit it to 2%.&nbsp; Canada and the United States have imposed compulsory labelling.&nbsp; All other countries have taken a voluntary non-legislative approach as far as labelling of trans fat is concerned.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Canada and the US, the consumption of trans fat exceeds 2% of their total calorie intake. In comparison for Singapore, we consume&nbsp;much lower, less than&nbsp;1% of the total calorie intake; and this works out to less than&nbsp;2 grams of trans fat a day.&nbsp; When we look at this in comparison with the World Health Organisation's recommendation of no more than 1%, then&nbsp;Singapore's consumption is within that, as opposed to the US and Canadian consumption which is twice that.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, we will continue to educate the public on the harmful effects of trans fat and to advise the public to cut down on fat intake.&nbsp; Since the year 2004, the Health Promotion Board&nbsp;has&nbsp;actively engaged our local food manufacturers to reduce trans fat in the manufacture of their goods and also to promote the use of voluntary labelling. Increasingly, food manufacturers have voluntarily listed the trans fat content of products&nbsp;such as in&nbsp;instant noodles, convenience meals, snack items and 3-in-1 beverages.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Health Promotion Board's&nbsp;website publishes the trans fat content of more than 300 common food items.&nbsp; We will continue to update and expand the list to include products by brand names.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Health Promotion Board's Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) scheme, and that is the pyramid symbol <p align=left>Column: 1155<p>that you can see on certain products,&nbsp;is a form of positive labelling that helps consumers identify healthier food products that are lower in fat, saturated fat, trans fat, sodium and sugar. To date, about 150 products, including bread, biscuits, cookies, cakes and margarine, carry the Healthier Choice Symbol&nbsp; labels and contain zero or lower&nbsp;amounts of trans fat compared to the regular versions.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few months, the Health Promotion Board will work on nutrition claims that can be allowed on food products with low or negligible trans fat.&nbsp; So this would allow the manufacturers to make these claims, provided they satisfy certain criteria which are being worked out.&nbsp; And this would encourage the food industry to voluntarily reduce or remove trans fat in their products and would also result in voluntary nutrition labelling on products with low or no trans fat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B>:&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;if there is no labelling and people will be consuming products that contain trans fat without being aware of it, over time, there will be the accumulative effect, and the accumulative effect will result&nbsp;in exceeding the safe limits prescribed by&nbsp;WHO.&nbsp; So would that not therefore mean that it is better for the Ministry to consider compulsory labelling, rather than to wait for this accumulative effect to take place because people are not aware that they are consuming&nbsp;trans fat?&nbsp; The second question I would like to ask&nbsp;is that the Minister of State mentioned about the Healthier&nbsp;Choice Symbol.&nbsp; Healthier Choice Symbol is&nbsp;very selective.&nbsp; Whereas if you opt for compulsory labelling,&nbsp;it is compulsory for all food manufacturers to alert consumers that their food products contain trans fat.&nbsp; So it is quite different when you talk about proactive methods through Healthier Choice Symbol&nbsp;as against the compulsory labelling.&nbsp; My third question to the Minister of State is: when will the Ministry consider trans fat labelling and, if <p align=left>Column: 1156<p>so, when will it be implemented after all the monitoring has been done?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Heng Chee How--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Heng Chee How</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the Member would agree with me that the outcome that we all look for is&nbsp;a population of healthy Singaporeans.&nbsp; In other words, whatever we do, the end result must be that, given the advice that we offer through public education, given the regulation that we do, given the products that we allow to be sold, as well as the practice of good healthy lifestyles,&nbsp;the combination of all these things, that is the job of the regulators as well as the responsibility of the individuals and the households that we produce health in our population.&nbsp; So if we agree on this and we apply this model to this subject of trans fat, and we do so holistically and&nbsp;in a calibrated manner, then we say, \"First, let us look at it.&nbsp; Should we be monitoring something like trans fat?\"&nbsp; The answer is yes, because it has certain adverse effects on health.&nbsp; Are we doing it?&nbsp; Yes, we are monitoring it.&nbsp; What is the international standard for trans fat consumption?&nbsp; Then we look at the World Health Organisation, and they say, no more than 1%.&nbsp; Then we look at our own situation, and we say, \"Where are we?\"&nbsp; And we are below that.&nbsp;We&nbsp;look at countries that have compulsory labelling.&nbsp;Canada and the United States,&nbsp;they are more than 2%.&nbsp; So we therefore have a certain sense of where we stand vis-a-vis the technical safety standards and also in comparison with countries that have gone on to compulsory labelling because they are in a different situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it mean that because we are less than 1%, therefore we could be complacent?&nbsp; The answer is no.&nbsp; So what must we do?&nbsp; We must do a combination of education and&nbsp;of pointing people in the right direction as to what they should be buying and consuming.&nbsp; Are we doing that?&nbsp; The answer is yes.&nbsp; So since 2004, this education on trans fat and working with the manufacturers to increase the <p align=left>Column: 1157<p>stock and range of goods that is low in or contains no trans fat has been ongoing.&nbsp; So we will press on with this.&nbsp; If we are interested in a population that does not really go into all the details in everything that they buy, which I think it is the reality for most people, then we make life easy by having a symbol that they know that if I go this way, it will be safer than any other way.&nbsp; So this Healthier Choice Symbol is a layman's way to better health.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can do it this way and&nbsp;let people understand that this is the common man's way of achieving the same outcome -&nbsp;better health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we come to labelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we stopping here?&nbsp; Are we saying that there is no scope to consider labelling?&nbsp; The answer is we are considering it, besides the monitoring.&nbsp; As I explained, we will work over the next few months to see how we can do positive labelling.&nbsp; Why do we do this? In Singapore, just about everything we eat is imported, so we have to balance between wanting something that is safe, making sure that it is correct for our population's consumption, without unnecessarily either adding on to the cost of those things or limiting our own choices.&nbsp; So we have to think of ways in which we could tilt the playing field so that market forces work in our favour for our objectives.&nbsp; This is where if we can push in the direction of positive labelling, letting manufacturers know that we would allow them, subject to&nbsp;their fulfilling certain criteria,&nbsp;to advertise&nbsp;their products which contain lower or no trans fat,&nbsp;then that together with our efforts in the Healthier Choice Symbol programme would help to nudge our population towards consumption of the right choices of food.&nbsp; Over time, this is the way that accords with our market situation, our realities and still get us closer to the objectives of&nbsp;a healthy population.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><p align=left>Column: 1158<p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There has been greater awareness of the importance of governance of charities in recent years.&nbsp; The Council on Governance of Institutions of a Public Character (CGI) was set up in January 2004 to set the minimum standards of governance and to&nbsp;play an advisory role in promoting good governance for Institutions of Public Character (IPCs).&nbsp; The CGI submitted a set of 19 recommendations which cover fund-raising practices,&nbsp;financial controls and accountability of IPCs, amongst other items. &nbsp;The Government accepted 15 of these recommendations in full, another three with modifications, and the remaining recommendation for adoption as a best practice.&nbsp; The mandatory CGI recommendations came into effect from 1st July 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) episode, the Government formed the Inter-Ministry Committee on the Regulation of Charities and IPCs (IMC) - I apologise for the acronyms.&nbsp; We set this up&nbsp;in October 2005 to review the regulatory framework for charities and IPCs.&nbsp;&nbsp; In arriving at its recommendations, the IMC studied the recommendations of the preceding CGI and the specific governance-related issues that were raised in the KPMG report on the NKF.&nbsp; After extensive public consultation, the IMC presented its recommendations in March 2006, and the Government accepted all its recommendations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Guiding principles</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As enunciated in the IMC report, the key guiding principles for our regulatory approach are as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the regulatory approach should nurture a charitable sector that remains driven by the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1160<p>Second, the boards of charities and IPCs are ultimately responsible for and accountable to all their stakeholders.&nbsp; The boards, therefore, need to take ownership in order to improve the governance of their respective organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the regulatory approach should encourage self-regulation within the charity sector.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, the regulatory approach should&nbsp;not be a \"one-size-fits-all\" but instead&nbsp;will&nbsp;be stratified, with larger charities subjected to more stringent rules compared to smaller ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill before this House therefore seeks to amend the Charities Act to incorporate the IMC recommendations.&nbsp; I am also taking this opportunity to make some other amendments to the Charities Act in order to strengthen the regulatory role of the Commissioner to complement the implementation of these recommendations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would&nbsp;like now to draw the attention of the House to the main clauses of the Bill.&nbsp; I shall begin with those that relate to the IMC recommendations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Expanded powers of the Commissioner</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IMC recommended granting the Commissioner additional powers in order to be&nbsp;more effective for the protection of charities and&nbsp;the public interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 inserts a new section 25A which&nbsp;empowers the Commissioner to suspend or remove any trustee, charity trustee, officer, agent or employee of a charity from being a member of that charity.&nbsp; This section, however, shall not apply to an exempt charity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 inserts new sections 26A and 26B to empower the Commissioner to <p align=left>Column: 1161<p>make orders on the application of the property of a charity under certain circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 inserts a new section 39B, within Part VIII of the Charities Act, to empower the Commissioner to prohibit, stop or restrict public fund-raising by a charity or person, including a commercial third party fund-raiser, where such a course of action is necessary in the public interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Consolidation of regulatory powers under Commissioner and Sector Administrators</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 17 inserts a new Part VIIIA, comprising new sections 40A, 40B and 40C, to provide for the making of regulations pertaining to IPCs and also to define the statutory role, functions and powers of the Sector Administrators.&nbsp; These&nbsp;are sectoral regulators appointed to assist the Commissioner in regulating the overall charity sector.&nbsp; The Sector Administrators cover six sectors, namely, the social service, education, arts and heritage, community and youth, health and sports sectors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Establishment of the Charity Council</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6 inserts a new Part IIA, comprising new sections 4A and 4B, to provide for the establishment and functions of the Charity Council.&nbsp; This is one of the key recommendations by the IMC.&nbsp; The purpose is to introduce people sector involvement in the regulation of charities and IPCs, especially in the promotion of good governance and best practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now move on to the amendments arising from recommendations that were not covered by the IMC.&nbsp; I would like to assure the House, first of all,&nbsp;that we are very mindful of the need to refrain from over-regulation so as not <p align=left>Column: 1162<p>to stifle the charity sector while proposing additional amendments to the Charities Act.&nbsp; The additional clauses would not impose regulatory burdens on charities and IPCs but only seek to penalise those who commit offences under the Charities Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will&nbsp;begin with the amendment to provide the Commissioner a discretionary power to refuse registration of, or to de-register, any charity.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Additional legislative amendments</I></p><p><br><I>Registration and de-registration of charities</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the existing Charities Act, the Commissioner cannot refuse registration of organisations with purposes that are or that purport to be exclusively charitable.&nbsp; This may inadvertently lead to the registration of suspect organisations.&nbsp; The Commissioner is also unable to de-register any charity unless it ceases to exist, is no longer in operation, or its purposes have been changed such that they are no longer exclusively charitable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To protect the public interest and to ensure that in future only <I>bona fide</I> organisations are registered as charities, clause 7 amends section 5 of the Act to provide for the grounds on which the Commissioner shall refuse to register an institution as a charity, or shall remove a registered institution from the register of charities, such as where it appears to the Commissioner that the registration of such an&nbsp;institution will be contrary to the public interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to assure the House that the office of the Commissioner had sought public feedback on all its proposals to tighten the charity registration process during the last two months.&nbsp; The public and the charities in general have welcomed this move and supported the proposals on having conditions for <p align=left>Column: 1163<p>registering and de-registering. &nbsp;The conditions for registration and de-registration of charities will be provided for in the regulations which will be brought into effect after this amendment Bill is passed.</p><p><br><I>Objectives and functions of the Commissioner</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to better define the objectives and functions of the Commissioner, clause 5 repeals and re-enacts section 4 for this purpose. &nbsp;In addition, clause 4 amends section 3 of the Act in relation to the powers, duties and functions of the Deputy Commissioner.&nbsp; Clause 4 also explicitly empowers the Commissioner to delegate specific powers, duties and functions to Assistant Commissioners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Power to prosecute</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 20 inserts a new section 47A to provide for the prosecution of offences under the Charities Act by public officers authorised by the Commissioner with the consent of the Attorney-General.&nbsp; This is necessary because the powers of prosecution of charities are currently derived from the IRAS Act as the Comptroller of Income Tax is&nbsp;currently also&nbsp;double-hatting as the Commissioner of Charities.&nbsp; With the transfer of the Office of the Commissioner from IRAS to MCYS, it is necessary to amend the Charities Act so as to empower the Commissioner to authorise other officers to prosecute charities for regulatory non-compliance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Power to compound</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the current Charities Act, the provision for the composition of offences under section 47 provides an offender a chance to avoid prosecution and conviction in court for less serious offences.&nbsp; To minimise the number of offences that require prosecution, clause 19 amends section 47(1) to increase the maximum composition sum to 50% of the amount <p align=left>Column: 1164<p>of the maximum fine prescribed for the offence.&nbsp; This means that the maximum composition sum would be increased from the current sum of $500 to a sum ranging from $2,500 to $5,000 depending, of course,&nbsp;on the offence. &nbsp;The composition sum will be tiered according to the seriousness of the offence, with the maximum quantum being meted out only for the more serious offences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Continuing offences</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that the underlying obligations are met even though the offender has paid the fine, I propose to make provisions for penalties for continuing offences.&nbsp; Clauses 8,&nbsp;9,&nbsp;10,&nbsp;11,&nbsp;12,&nbsp;13,&nbsp;14,&nbsp;15 and&nbsp;21 amend the Act to provide for the punishment of a continuing offence of a further fine not exceeding $50 or $100, depending on the offence, for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after the conviction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Protection from liability</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, clause 18 inserts a new section 46A to protect the Commissioner and other officers, and the Sector Administrators, from liability for anything done by them in good faith in the course of exercising their power, discharging their duty or performing any function under the law.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the charity sector is an integral part of the Government's \"Many Helping Hands\" approach as the charity sector&nbsp;plays a very important role in serving the community.&nbsp; The Government is, therefore, committed to facilitate the growth of the charity sector whilst not over-regulating the charities.&nbsp; Whilst the Government can put in place basic regulations for the sector, ultimately the best form of regulation is still self-regulation.&nbsp; Charities should ensure that they are well-governed in order to win the trust of the public, especially their donors and volunteers, <p align=left>Column: 1165<p>because, ultimately, the charity sector can grow only with strong public support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.13 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</B> Sir, before I begin, I would like to declare that I initiated the incorporation of an entity that is in the process of being registered as a charity.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Charities (Amendment) Bill could not have come at a more appropriate time.&nbsp; The on-going law suit by the present board of the newly-constituted NKF against some former board members is yet again another reminder that organisations that raise money from the public in the name of charity should not be left entirely on their own to run their affairs with limited or no supervision.&nbsp;&nbsp;The NKF saga should no doubt serve as a salutary lesson for us and for which this Bill before us is an attempted response to fix a weakness in the system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the parent Act by providing, <I>inter alia</I>, additional functions, duties and powers for the Commissioner.&nbsp; Besides, the proposed amendments also seek to improve the administration of institutions of public character.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the passing of the Bill mainly because I believe it tries to strengthen the foundations of our charities here in Singapore.&nbsp; The loss of faith by the public in the old NKF made it necessary for us to take steps to restore the trust and confidence in the process of raising funds from the man-in-the-street for charitable purposes, and to put in place&nbsp;safeguards to ensure that&nbsp;funds are properly spent.&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I have some observations to make as a matter of principle when <p align=left>Column: 1166<p>looking at our policies in regulating charities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, one of the biggest challenges in formulating charity-related policies lies with striking the right balance.&nbsp; The principle that underpins our welfare approach is the many-helping-hands approach.&nbsp; Indeed over the years, many VWOs have emerged to work alongside the community and Government agencies, as part of the many-helping-hands, to help needy Singaporeans.&nbsp; These VWOs were able to undertake their work more easily because they could rely on the generous donations from the public.&nbsp; Yet, as we have seen with the NKF episode, it is unwise to expect that these charities will be able to regulate themselves effectively and meet the standards of governance expected of them by the public. There is therefore an expectation from the public that charities must now be more tightly regulated.&nbsp; The issue really is: how far should the state&nbsp;regulate these charities in the public interest without at the same time imposing too much fetter on these bodies to a point where it becomes counter-productive?&nbsp; The people who run these charities must be able to get on with the business of running these charities without at the same time having to worry too much about the regulator knocking at&nbsp;their door at midnight.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It would indeed be sad if these well-meaning volunteers decide to throw in the towel simply because the red tape is just too much.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the other challenge, of course, is to provide these charities with sufficient clarity in rules to enable them to comply with what is required of them. I will expand on this later. But suffice&nbsp;to say, for now, that we do not want our charities to pore through voluminous amount of rules and bye-laws. Again, one would say that that would be an over-kill. What we should be concentrating on is to have a code with well-illustrated principles that would guide the conduct of these <p align=left>Column: 1167<p>bodies, rather than an elaborate list of chapters and verses.&nbsp; We want a culture of governance to evolve, rather than one that is dictated by rules and bye-laws.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, and related to the point made earlier, is the issue of the increasing&nbsp;burden of operating cost arising from the new standards and regulations that these rules are expected to impose. To comply with these new provisions, charities will now have to seriously consider relying on more outside help.&nbsp; Any&nbsp;well-meaning charity that seeks to comply with these rules will think hard about getting professional help; whether it be in audit or&nbsp;otherwise. This would unnecessarily add to the operating cost of the charity as&nbsp;professionals,&nbsp;and I can vouch for that,&nbsp;are expensive to hire. Sir, the point is, well-meaning and&nbsp;dedicated&nbsp;charities are not necessarily your most well-endowed ones, financially.&nbsp; The challenge would, therefore, be how to strike a right balance without throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, our regulations that govern charities should work towards targeting, not only those who run charities, but also&nbsp;providing an adequate framework that allows supporters of these charities with enough information, both with respect to the work and the performance of these charities on a regular basis, in order that they may better understand and make&nbsp;better&nbsp;informed choices of what they do. We want our donors to make informed choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, charities that do not have properly defined&nbsp;programmes, or&nbsp;clearly established performance milestones and governance standards, will have a harder time explaining to their patrons why the next dollar should go to them.&nbsp; Donors, as much as consumers at the marketplace, must be given the ability to make informed choices about where they want to put their hard-earned money, even if it is meant to benefit the less fortunate. In other words, we should, as a matter of principle, emphasise more on <p align=left>Column: 1168<p>disclosure in the charity sector. By disclosing, the public will have a better sense of how their money&nbsp;is spent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the broad canvas set by some governing principles that I would like to see governing our charities framework, I would now like to turn specifically to the provisions of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 5 of the Bill seeks to amend section 4 of the Act by seeking to provide greater focus on maintaining public confidence in charities and in promoting growth of the charity sector, promoting good governance and regulating for compliance. Towards this end, the functions of the Commissioner would include, <I>inter alia</I>, the determination of whether institutions are charities, and to investigate and take the necessary remedial action where there is misconduct on the part of the charity concerned. Additionally, to enable the Commissioner to discharge his functions, there are now more teeth being given to his office to, for instance, suspend the relevant person as a member of the charity and, as a final move, to register the charity concerned to the extent that it has been remiss or&nbsp;fraudulent in the conduct of its business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I welcome the tightening of the existing Act. However, I feel that more could be done to take it some steps further. I can cite several examples where clearer legislative guidance would&nbsp;be of help. For instance, the amendment Bill gives the Commissioner wide ranging powers to determine if a particular organisation is indeed a charity. However, this begs the essential question of what is a charity in the eyes of a Commissioner and who should qualify.&nbsp; Previously, the Commissioner of Charities is unable to refuse registration of organisations as charities if they are set up exclusively for charitable purposes. Also, the Commissioner is unable to de-register any charity unless it ceases to exist or is no longer in operation or its objectives have <p align=left>Column: 1169<p>changed. Under the present amendment, the Commissioner is given discretionary powers not to register and to de-register an existing charity that does not meet the&nbsp;public interest&nbsp;requirements. The question really is: &nbsp;what is in the public interest? Is it to be determined, as they say, in the court of equity, by the length of the Chancellor&rsquo;s foot? The extensive powers given to the Commissioner comes with the expectation that close guidance should be issued from his office in order to guide and help the public to better understand what the Government&rsquo;s definition of a charity is.&nbsp; For instance, one would accept that any charity that expects to be registered must conform with the social mores of the time. One would not expect, for example,&nbsp;the Commissioner to register a society as a charity that is committed to the promotion of the benefits of voodoo magic in our society; or for that matter, a charity that is dedicated to the promotion of sexual freedom. While these examples may not obviously be supported, there are others, I am sure, that are less clear. I am thinking of, for instance,&nbsp;charities that are dedicated to the promotion of same gender unions or charities that strongly support the abolition of abortion. How and on what basis should the Commissioner decide whether such charities should be allowed to register and, if registered, guide the conduct of the activities of these societies or organisations with respect to their dealings with the public?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This leads me to a separate but related point. Presently, there is nothing in the amendment Bill that allows for appeal from the decision of the Commissioner. Following the amendment, it would appear that there is little recourse by way of an administrative appeal to the Minister if the Commissioner decides either not to register a charity or if he decides to de-register the charity. Ordinarily, it would not be unusual in an act for an appeal to <p align=left>Column: 1170<p>be made to the Minister against the decision of the department concerned. Unfortunately, such a statutory right of appeal is missing under the present amendment Bill. Is this omission intended by the Government?&nbsp; If it is, I should be grateful if the Minster could give an explanation as to the reason why it is missing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presumably, much of the work of the Commissioner will be guided by the Charity Council, the formation of which is contemplated by the present Bill. This brings me to the next point. Clauses 4A and 4B relate to the formation and functions of the Charity Council. Clause 4B, in particular, provides that it shall be within the remit of the council, <I>inter alia</I>, to advise the Commissioner on any question that he may refer it, to make such recommendations to the Commissioner and to promote self-regulation and good governance. These are indeed very&nbsp;heavy and onerous responsibilities for the council to discharge, and I welcome it.&nbsp; However, if it is the job of the Commissioner to promote public trust and confidence in the charities, much of that must surely begin with the necessity of appointing good men and women to the council. The composition of the council would be crucial as it would appear to be expected to play a part in helping the Commissioner to decide which charity operates in the public interest and the one that does not, and also to help set&nbsp;the standards of governance for these charities. Unfortunately, the Bill does not give much guidance as to how the Government should go about appointing people to the council.&nbsp; Should the council be expected to have a fair mix of established operators, Government representatives, donors and recipients so that there will be a fair balance in the views represented; should there be a code that governs the conduct of the council in the deliberations, in as much as charities are now expected to abide by a certain standard of conduct that will be <p align=left>Column: 1171<p>established by the Commissioner? I should be grateful if the Minister could throw some light on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, clause 39A provides that no person shall conduct or participate in any fund-raising appeal unless he has a permit or is exempted from having to comply with the provisions of the Act. \"Fund raising appeal\", under clause 39, has been defined as, and I quote:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"(a)&nbsp;an appeal, whether made expressly or impliedly, to any member of the public to give money or other property (whether for consideration or otherwise) which is made in association with a representation that the whole or any part of its proceeds is to be applied for charitable benevolent or philanthropic purposes;&nbsp;or</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) a receipt from any member of the public of any money or other property (whether for consideration or otherwise which is given in whole or in part for any charitable benevolent or philanthropic purposes).\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the prohibition in clause 39A and the definition of fund-raising appeal in clause 39, it would seem the net may be&nbsp;inadvertently&nbsp;cast more widely than it is intended. For instance, if a newspaper article were to highlight the plight of a family in financial difficulty, with a view to soliciting public sympathy and perhaps donation, would the journalist or the newspaper be impliedly appealing to the public to give money for a benevolent cause, something that is proscribed by clause 39A of the Bill? Additionally, if you were to give someone&nbsp;money out of sympathy, would the money that you give to the member of public for a benevolent reason be caught under sub-clause (b) which seems to prohibit such an activity?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite clearly, the situations I just described are not the sort of mischief that the Bill seeks&nbsp;to correct.&nbsp; Nonetheless, if you look at the way fund-raising appeal is <p align=left>Column: 1172<p>defined, it does give rise to a certain level of uncertainty which is unsatisfactory from a drafting point of view.&nbsp; I hope the Minister can shed some light on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Bill seeks to define what an institution of public character (\"IPC\") means and to set out an administrative framework that allows the Sector Administrator to regulate charities, including approving institutions as IPCs, within their respective sectors. I support the streamlining of the administration of the charities and IPCs along the lines suggested&nbsp;by the Bill. &nbsp;However, if the administration of charities and IPCs are to be divided among the Sector Administrators, one question that arises is whether there will be any assurance that the quality of administration will be uniform across all&nbsp;sectors. In other words, would the bar to qualify as an IPC be the same across the sectors? &nbsp;What assurance will the public have that the standards, especially with regard to defining an IPC,&nbsp;be the same?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this amendment Bill is certainly a welcome and timely change to our Charities Act. We need to strengthen public confidence and trust in our charity sector. This is absolutely crucial to our approach of relying on many helping hands to support the needs of the poor and needy in our society. However, our strategy of leaning on voluntary groups to provide the needs does require, on our part, a certain delicate balancing between the need for tight scrutiny and transparency, and the need to provide some flexibility to the charities. &nbsp;How that balance should be calibrated would very much depend on the Commissioner and the Council that would seek to assist him in this task.&nbsp; For now, the Charities Act and its amendment seek to provide a robust framework within which the Commissioner is to undertake his work.&nbsp; The devil as, they say, is in the details.&nbsp; I do hope that over the months, the Commissioner will come up with clear <p align=left>Column: 1173<p>guidelines and codes of conduct and governance to let the public know what the expectations are, and not just leave them to second guess.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Sir, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.27 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> Sir, I propose to respond to the Member's speech in inverse&nbsp;order.&nbsp; I will deal with his specific points first and then return to the more general points.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member referred to clause 5, which sets out the duties, functions and powers of the Commissioner.&nbsp; Amongst the list of questions he submitted was the definition of a charity,&nbsp;how would the Commissioner decide what is in the public interest and why there is no formal route of appeal against his decisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The definition of a charity is actually a rather difficult one.&nbsp; I have discovered that it has actually taken almost 400 years of English case law, modified by local experience, in order to generate the list which is contained in the Bill.&nbsp; But just for the record, I would read out the list of what charitable objects are. First, the relief of poverty.&nbsp; Second, the advancement of education. Third, the advancement of religion. And fourth is a multi-limb clause&nbsp;- other purposes beneficial to the community, such as the advancement of health; the advancement of citizenship or community development; the advancement of arts, heritage or science; the advancement of&nbsp;environment protection or improvement; the relief of those in need by reason of youth, age, ill-health or&nbsp;disability, financial hardship or other&nbsp;disadvantages; and the advancement of animal welfare.&nbsp; So it is&nbsp;a very wide spectrum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we are trying to do here is not to redefine a charity, but rather to give <p align=left>Column: 1174<p>the Commissioner more flexibility, to see whether someone who puts up his hand and says, \"I am pursuing one of these objectives\", is really doing so in a <I>bona fide</I> organisation and in a way which is acceptable to the public.&nbsp; So it is really for the Commissioner to exercise judgment on behalf of the public interest.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will the Commissioner decide then what is in the public interest?&nbsp; The key here is to consult the public widely that this is, at the end of the day, a community effort and, therefore, no one man, one council, one board or one Minister can or should unilaterally decide what is in the public interest. I give you that assurance that in the exercise of these powers, the Commissioner will consult widely.&nbsp; That is also why we set up a Charity Council to provide a ready avenue of people to provide opinions and guidance to the Commissioner in making these difficult decisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we have also set out, in our amendments, that the grounds on which he decides, to either de-register or refuse to register, would be set out.&nbsp; In other words, we would do this transparently and a decision would be out there for the public to see and to make their own judgments on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, I decided that there was no need to set up a formal route of appeal to the Minister because the process would be done through wide consultation; the process would be published and everyone would be in the loop. But having said that, if anyone subsequently does feel aggrieved,&nbsp;he can still write to me.&nbsp; I promise&nbsp;Members&nbsp;that I will still take it up, look at it, discuss it with the Commissioner, discuss it with the Charity Council, and, of course, with the relevant stakeholders.&nbsp; Of course, <I>in extremis</I>, there is still the right of judicial review.&nbsp; I give Members&nbsp;that assurance that the Commissioner of Charities will <p align=left>Column: 1175<p>exercise this power flexibly, but carefully, and in the public interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His next point was on clause 4.&nbsp; I agree with&nbsp;him that in the establishment of a Charity Council, we must get people with standing in the community; people with experience in the voluntary sector; people with financial, legal, entrepreneurial experience; people who will bring diverse perspectives to bear on this very difficult and heterogeneous&nbsp;sector.&nbsp; I would tell&nbsp;Members honestly that it is difficult to assemble that Charity Council.&nbsp; And I am very grateful to the pioneer batch who has agreed to serve on this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with him that as they get into the saddle, they will also have to devise the work processes, the norms and the means of consultation because the key reason we chose to have a Charity Council, as opposed to just empowering the Commissioner with more teeth, is to send the message that we want this charity sector to be self-regulated and we want people from the community to come up and to help the sector stay viable and safe.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Member's specific question on fund-raising appeal - has the definition of this been too wide?&nbsp; He cited two examples - in a newspaper article and personal private donation.&nbsp; If a newspaper article is written to convey news, it is certainly not a fund-raising exercise.&nbsp; But I am aware that sometimes the way it is written sails very close to that definition.&nbsp; So far, no article has crossed that line.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, I think journalists will exercise the power of the pen responsibly, that they are meant to convey news, maybe to convey comments on an event, but they should not be embarked on a fund-raising exercise.&nbsp; If they wish to do so, then apply for a permit.&nbsp; Similarly, out of the goodness of your heart, if you&nbsp;make a personal donation to someone whom you happen to know and is&nbsp;in need, we are not going to deem this as a <p align=left>Column: 1176<p>public fund-raising exercise.&nbsp; So, again, I give him the assurance that commonsense will prevail.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his point about sector administrators, I agree with him absolutely that there is a need to maintain uniformity of standards across all the sectors, and that is why, again, we need to make sure that when we start this system, there is a lot of consultation, collaboration and calibration across all the sectors.&nbsp; We are thinking of establishing an Accounting Standards Board under the aegis of ACRA which will help devise accounting standards which can be applied to these other non-corporate sectors as well.&nbsp; That will give everyone a common term of reference in order to generate their reports and in order to comply with the standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me come back to the more general points.&nbsp; I agree with the Member absolutely that we have to strike a balance.&nbsp; This is not one of those sectors where the Government can solve it by throwing lots and lots of red tape, and lots and lots of fines or penalties.&nbsp; This is a sector which depends on human compassion, generosity of spirit and the ability to self organise in order to keep it going.&nbsp; So what we are really after is to give people, ordinary members of the public, trust and confidence in the charity sector, and we believe this can best be done by having total transparency.&nbsp; In fact, the bulk of all the rules and so-called impositions that we are placing on the charity sector is really to provide more information.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&nbsp;was his fourth point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could summarise, it is about trust and transparency, and provide all the information that the public needs, all the information that the donors and volunteers need, so that they have an assurance that their money and the time that they donate&nbsp;are put to good use and, if I may add, to also show the value of the services that have been delivered; in other <p align=left>Column: 1177<p>words, what is the output, ie, do not just show the input equation but show the results of your intervention and services to the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with his second general point that there is a need for clarity in rules.&nbsp; The speech that I have just made, and I mentioned sections here and clauses there, that is not the way in which we will govern the sector, but good examples, work examples or problems from the past will be written up, discussed and&nbsp;presented, so that people know what to do and what not to do in the future.&nbsp; And the Member is quite right, it is really about generating culture, rather than creating new codes.&nbsp; That is what we hope to achieve in this collaborative approach between Government, the voluntary welfare&nbsp;sector and the Charity Council.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third point, will more charities need professional help, specifically more on auditing and accounting services, and, therefore, will that raise cost?&nbsp; My answer to that is, that is why we are choosing a tiered&nbsp;and not a one-size-fits-all approach&nbsp;because you will then end up with a very rigorous and&nbsp;onerous system, which the small fledgling charities would not be able to afford.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I would give him the assurance that it will be a light touch for the small start-ups but, certainly, as an IPC or a charity grows bigger and behaves, to all intents and purposes, like corporations, it must then be subject to the more onerous standards which we expect of a company or a corporation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with his fourth point which is that all the supporters of a charity or an&nbsp;IPC deserve more information.&nbsp; The currency is money and time from supporters and, in return, the charities must provide information to the supporters&nbsp;- information on how your money is spent, <p align=left>Column: 1178<p>information on the output and the effects of the programmes which you have funded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill, unfortunately, has come at a time when perhaps we are reacting to events which have caused public consternation.&nbsp; But even if&nbsp;you put that aside, I think the direction in which we are amending this is still correct and is appropriate for the future that we are trying to steer the charity sector towards.&nbsp; So, remember the fundamental points - that it is about self-regulation, it is about trust, it is about transparency and confidence.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I just have a point of clarification to make. The Minister said earlier that the Commissioner would decide on what a charity is after he has extensively consulted the public, to get a better sense.&nbsp; So we have, through a process of public consultation,&nbsp; come to an understanding of what exactly is a charity that meets the public interest.&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister can clarify how the Commissioner&nbsp;- or perhaps it is early days&nbsp;- may want to go about undertaking this work.<p><br>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> As I said, the specific objects of charity are already fairly well defined.&nbsp; What I am more concerned about is someone who looks through this and says, \"Ah!

Having said that you are going to do that service, are you really organised&nbsp;- do you have the people, the volunteers, the expertise, and the funding in place?&nbsp; So, it is more a check on bona fides rather than a question of whether a certain objective is charitable or not because that, I believe, is fairly well <p align=left>Column: 1179<p>established by convention over the last 400 years.<p><br>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If there is an application pending, I do not want to pre-judge it at this point.&nbsp; The Member is right that ultimately there is a judgement call.&nbsp; Like all judgement calls, you cannot make everybody happy.&nbsp; The Commissioner will have to ensure that his decisions are consistent with his assessment of where the public, in general, stands on a particular issue.&nbsp; I cannot be more specific than that.&nbsp; But you have to ensure that it fits with the public policy, as stated by the Government and the mores, the values and the views of the general public.&nbsp; And because we live in a diverse society, it is impossible to cater to every single view, some of which may be on the margin or even extreme.<p><br>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> That is a valid observation.&nbsp; I think, after the recent <p align=left>Column: 1180<p>events, auditors have realised that this is no longer just a small act of charity.&nbsp; Auditing an organisation is a serious job and comes with all the accountability and responsibility of auditing any other company or commercial entity.&nbsp; With this realisation, auditing firms which in the past would devote very little bandwidth and, therefore, could agree easily, now have to be more cautious in their commitments.&nbsp; But having said that, I think a new equilibrium will arise.&nbsp; Yes, in some cases, auditing fees have gone up.&nbsp; But in so far as I see it, the fee is a reasonable one that recognises the serious responsibility and accountability that come with the job.&nbsp; I think that is something which we should not begrudge them because it is a job, and their professional standing is on the line.&nbsp; How can we help?&nbsp; There have been some suggestions, for instance, to make sure that the financial year for charities perhaps not be in sync with the commercial sector because when everybody is jam-packed the last minute and you are short of staff.&nbsp; So, we will look at creative ways in which we can reduce the load on both the charity sector as well as the auditors who are performing this service.&nbsp; But, at the end of the day, I am saying it is a professional service and one that we should pay a fair rate for.&nbsp; Expectations are then set and the key thing is you assure them that when someone signs off on the annual report, you know it is a fair and accurate representation of the state of affairs in that organisation.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These Orders are made to implement the international safety and security standards and recommended practices contained in the Annexes to the Chicago Convention, to which Singapore is a party.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine or an imprisonment term of one year or both is not commensurate with the possible catastrophic consequences of aviation safety and security violations.&nbsp; As an aviation hub, Singapore must assure the travelling public, other stakeholders and also potential entrants into the aviation system that we are committed to uphold the highest standards of safety and security.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1184<p>The proposed amendments to section 3 of the Act increase the maximum penalty which can be imposed under an Order to a fine of $100,000 or&nbsp;five years' imprisonment, or both.&nbsp; This will enable subsequent amendments to be made to Orders to introduce stiffer penalties for aviation safety and aviation security offences, making our penalties for such violations comparable with those of the major aviation States.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The intention is to increase the maximum penalty for the most serious safety offences under the Air Navigation Order to $50,000 or&nbsp;two years' imprisonment, or both, for the first offence, and $100,000 or&nbsp;five years' imprisonment, or both, for the second and subsequent offences.&nbsp; Examples of such serious safety violations include: &nbsp;(1) an airline allowing its aircraft to be operated without a valid Certificate of Airworthiness; (2) an airline scheduling a pilot for duty beyond his or her maximum flying duty hours, which may cause fatigue, hence creating the risk of a major aviation accident and possible loss of lives; (3) an aircraft maintenance and repair company failing to service an aircraft to the required safety standards.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enhance aviation security, which is another critical area in support of our overall aviation hub operations and in light of the global threat against civil aviation, we intend to raise the deterrent effect against any breaches of security measures by airlines operating at Changi.&nbsp; The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)&nbsp; has reviewed the penalties for security-related offences and intends to increase the maximum fine for offences under the Air Navigation (Aviation Security) Order from $5,000 to $10,000.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 of the Bill also amends section 3 of the Act to empower the Minister to make an Order relating to the investigation of any accident or incident <p align=left>Column: 1185<p>involving air navigation and, in particular, authorising the entry, inspection and examination of any place, structure or aircraft. Such powers of entry and inspection are essential to the effectiveness of an investigation into an aircraft accident or incident occurring in Singapore.&nbsp; This is in line with the guidance of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) that investigators should, through legislation, have immediate and unrestricted access to all relevant evidence without requiring prior consent from judicial bodies or other authorities.&nbsp; Major aviation states like the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States also provide for similar powers.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 4 repeals section 12 which is no longer necessary in the light of the amendment of section 3 by clause 3.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 5 of the Bill inserts a new section 27A to provide for persons managing a corporate body or office bearers of an unincorporated association to be liable to be prosecuted for an offence committed by the corporate body or unincorporated association if the offence was done with the consent, connivance or attributable to the neglect of the person.&nbsp; This will encourage persons managing corporate bodies or unincorporated associations to adopt responsible practices at a more systematic level and conduct more due diligence checks so as to comply with the safety and security standards and measures stipulated by CAAS and SPF under the Act.&nbsp; These standards are in accordance with the international standards and recommended practices contained in the Annexes to the Chicago Convention.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6 amends section 28A(1) to increase the maximum sum which may be collected from a person for compounding an offence under the Act which is prescribed as a compoundable offence.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1186<p>The maximum sum is increased to take into account inflation as this amount has not been amended since its insertion into the Act in 1987.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, clause 6 of the Bill amends section 28A of the Act to increase the maximum sum from the existing $200 to $5,000, or half of the maximum prescribed for the offence, whichever is the lower.&nbsp; The latter formula is modelled after section 199A of the Criminal Procedure Code and will cater to less severe offences which do not warrant the maximum composition sum of $5,000.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These amendments would enable the SPF to enhance compliance with the security directives by the aircraft operators. To illustrate, an aircraft operator currently has to ensure that its security measures, such as flight pre-checks, access to unattended aircraft, security of boarding passes, security of baggage, catering and cargo, staff training and quality control, are all in place.&nbsp; Any failure to implement those measures constitutes a breach of the security directives issued by the Singapore Police Force and is an offence under the Air Navigation (Aviation Security) Order.&nbsp; Depending on the severity of the breaches, the Police may choose to either compound or prosecute an offender, particularly where it concerns recalcitrant offenders or where there are aggravating circumstances. The proposed increases are reasonable compared to the penalties prescribed in major aviation states for similar offences.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6 also inserts a new subsection (1A) to make it clear that no further proceedings will be taken against the person compounding an offence, on payment of the composition fine.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Conclusion</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments that I have presented today are necessary to ensure that the Air Navigation Act <p align=left>Column: 1187<p>remains relevant to our needs.&nbsp; They will contribute to public safety, enable us to maintain Singapore's excellent reputation of high aviation safety and security standards, and strengthen Changi Airport's position as a leading global air hub.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The effective execution of CPR requires both technical skills and mental readiness. An individual trained in CPR further needs experience and maturity to assess whether a crisis situation needs one to effect an appropriate intervention through CPR or not.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In secondary schools, First Aid is a core component in all Uniformed Group (UG) training programmes. The First Aid course is at the basic level which includes teaching students to render first aid treatment for cuts and bruises, and the dressing of wounds.&nbsp; However, the First Aid Course does not include CPR.&nbsp;CPR requires additional training and certification.&nbsp;Only Uniformed Groups like Red Cross, SJAB and National Civil Defence Cadet Corps that have trained instructors include CPR as a compulsory training component as part of an extended First Aid package.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPR requires judgement and technical expertise to be appropriately and effectively executed in a given crisis situation. The training of CPR requires skilled instructors who need to be re-certified every three years.
