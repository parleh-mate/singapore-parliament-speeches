These  provisions  are\r\n\r\navailable to all students of the respective universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National University of Singapore has also\r\n\r\nlaunched  the  \"NUS  Overseas  Colleges\".   This   is   a\r\n\r\nstrategic programme aimed at providing a small number  of\r\n\r\nselect  students  the  opportunity to  be  nurtured  into\r\n\r\ndynamic  and  resourceful entrepreneurs by  immersion  in\r\n\r\nvibrant entrepreneurial hubs which are anchored by strong\r\n\r\nacademic institutions.   Students will be sent on a  one-year  stint to these overseas colleges to work as interns\r\n\r\nattached    to    high-tech   start-ups,    and    attend\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  courses  at  partnering   universities.\r\n\r\nNUS  has  to date set up two overseas colleges -  in  the\r\n\r\nSilicon  Valley in partnership with Stanford  University,\r\n\r\nand in the Bio Valley, in partnership with University  of\r\n\r\nPennsylvania.   38 students are currently in the  Silicon\r\n\r\nValley,  and another 10 are expected to set off  for  the\r\n\r\nBio  Valley in January 2003.  By 2010, NUS plans to  send\r\n\r\n250  students  (or 4% of the average NUS  annual  cohort)\r\n\r\neach year to its overseas colleges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional cost incurred for a student who\r\n\r\nspends  one year at an overseas college is about $35,500.\r\n\r\nAbout  two-thirds of this cost is borne by the internship\r\n\r\ncompanies which our students are attached to.  The  other\r\n\r\none-third  is borne by the Government.

For example, there was an increase of  39%\r\n\r\nin  the requests received between 2000 and 2001, from 469\r\n\r\nto  650.  These requests come from candidates with a wide\r\n\r\nrange  of medical or psychological conditions of  varying\r\n\r\ndegrees  of  severity  from mild to  very  serious.   The\r\n\r\ndetermination  as to whether a condition  merits  special\r\n\r\narrangements,  and the extent of special  arrangements  a\r\n\r\ndisability  merits, are not clear-cut,  black  and  white\r\n\r\ndecisions.   The Ministry has therefore decided  that  an\r\n\r\neven-handed,  transparent and fair approach  be  adopted.\r\n\r\nAll candidates who have been granted special arrangements\r\n\r\nin  an  examination  will  have an  annotation  in  their\r\n\r\ncertificates.  This annotation will indicate  that  these\r\n\r\ncandidates have taken their examinations under conditions\r\n\r\nwhich  are different from those who take the examinations\r\n\r\nunder  the normal prescribed conditions.   The annotation\r\n\r\nwill   only   state  that  the  students  sat   for   the\r\n\r\nexaminations under special arrangements.  No  details  of\r\n\r\nthe  special arrangements will appear on the certificate.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Education will also not reveal details of\r\n\r\nthe   student's  reasons  for  requesting   the   special\r\n\r\narrangements  unless the student authorises the  Ministry\r\n\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy of annotation will ensure that even as\r\n\r\nwe  allow candidates who need special arrangements access\r\n\r\nto  our  examinations, we do so in a way  that  maintains\r\n\r\ntransparency  in  our  examination system  and  that  the\r\n\r\nexamination system is as fair as possible to those\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents  who  take  the examinations  under  the  normal\r\n\r\nprescribed conditions.  And that it is also fair to those\r\n\r\nsmall  number of candidates each year who do have medical\r\n\r\nor  psychological conditions which are serious enough  to\r\n\r\nmerit special arrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, there were 216 students from the PSLE and\r\n\r\n434   students  from  the  GCE `N',  `O'  and  `A'  level\r\n\r\nexaminations  who  applied for special arrangements.   Of\r\n\r\nthese,  all the students from PSLE and 382 (88%) students\r\n\r\nfrom  the  GCE  `N', O' and `A' levels  who  applied  for\r\n\r\nspecial    arrangements   were   given    such    special\r\n\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These numbers represent about 0.43% of the total\r\n\r\ncandidature  for  the 2001 PSLE and about  0.63%  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal candidature for the 2001 GCE `N', `O' and `A' level\r\n\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  if  the  Ministry had considered  the  negative\r\n\r\nimpact  and consequences of annotation on these  children\r\n\r\nin  subsequent years, such as labelling and stigmatising,\r\n\r\nwhich   could   bring  about  a  further   reduction   of\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  these children for mainstreaming  and\r\n\r\nintegrating  into  the society and  hence,  increase  the\r\n\r\nobstacles  for  independent living, when  all  that  such\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged students are asking for is accommodation to\r\n\r\nhelp them level up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, did the Ministry discuss the issues with\r\n\r\nthe  relevant organisations such as the Society  for  the\r\n\r\nDeaf and DAS before implementing the annotation policy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, besides the US, which are the other\r\n\r\ncountries that practise annotation or flagging?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, the Ministry considered\r\n\r\nthe  matter  very  seriously and we decided  to  adopt  a\r\n\r\nbalanced and open approach.  We recognise that there  are\r\n\r\nstudents  who have medical or psychological problems  who\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to sit for and do well in their PSLE,  GCE\r\n\r\n'O', 'A' and 'N' level examinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause we want to give these students an opportunity  to\r\n\r\ntake    these   examinations   that   we   provide   this\r\n\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no question about not providing\r\n\r\naccommodation.  The  Ministry  is  prepared  to   provide\r\n\r\naccommodation   where  there  is   proper   medical   and\r\n\r\npsychological assessment and the Ministry considers  that\r\n\r\nthese  reasons  are strong and serious  enough  to  merit\r\n\r\nspecial arrangements.  That will continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we have to balance this against\r\n\r\nfairness  to other candidates who may not have asked  for\r\n\r\nspecial  arrangements  to take their  examinations  under\r\n\r\nnormal   circumstances.   The  range  of   requests   has\r\n\r\nincreased  over the years.  In the early years,  we  have\r\n\r\nhad   very   clear-cut  requests  -  generally,  physical\r\n\r\ndisabilities for which there is very little doubt one way\r\n\r\nor  the  other.  But in recent years, we have received  a\r\n\r\nlarger  number  of  requests, mainly of  a  psychological\r\n\r\nnature  for which the severity and the precise nature  of\r\n\r\nthe  requests require much more judgement, and  even  the\r\n\r\nmedical  and  psychological professionals do  not  always\r\n\r\nagree  on them. So what we want to do is to balance  this\r\n\r\ndesire  to  accommodate more of such requests  which  are\r\n\r\nvalid together with the need to be more open and balanced\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  having agreed to  these  requests.   We\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  this is a fair and open  system  by  which\r\n\r\nstudents  who  have conditions which are  serious  enough\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to get access to special arrangements  and\r\n\r\nallow them to proceed on to higher education.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  to comment on the number of students  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen asking for special accommodation which has increased\r\n\r\nover  the  years.   Would it not  be  fair  to  say  that\r\n\r\npreviously, most parents would not be so informed  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  types of disabilities that our children could suffer\r\n\r\nfrom   but  with  society  maturing  and  becoming   more\r\n\r\nsophisticated  and  informed, some of these  disabilities\r\n\r\nwhich were previously not detectable or the parents would\r\n\r\nnot know about it ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Khor, could you make your questions\r\n\r\nconcise, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister to comment that perhaps the Ministry could  look\r\n\r\nat  it  from  the  point  of view  that  the  number  has\r\n\r\nincreased because of information access.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other question is: why did the Ministry actually\r\n\r\nimplement  the  annotation policy  at  a  time  when  the\r\n\r\nCollege  Board of the US has just agreed to stop flagging\r\n\r\nthe  scores of disabled students who take the  SAT  under\r\n\r\nspecial conditions, such as extra time?  From what I read\r\n\r\nabout  the  practice of flagging in the US,  one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons for flagging is to prevent abuse by students who,\r\n\r\nin reality, have no real disabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Khor, you are making a speech again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> No, I am asking a question.\r\n\r\nThis  links  to  the question that I am asking  now.   If\r\n\r\nindeed  one of the primary objectives of the Ministry  is\r\n\r\nto  prevent this abuse, can the Ministry consider instead\r\n\r\nto  implement  more stringent conditions  under  which  a\r\n\r\nstudent  can  have special accommodation?   For  example,\r\n\r\nrecognising tests ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Khor, if you do not ask your\r\n\r\nquestion, I will ask you to resume your seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Yes, this is the question.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to ask the Ministry if they can  consider\r\n\r\nrecognising  tests from, say, accredited panels  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry can be assured that these are students  who\r\n\r\nhave   real  disabilities  and  are  asking  for  special\r\n\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, Dr Khor is indeed correct.\r\n\r\nAs  I have said earlier, there is an increasing number of\r\n\r\nconditions  which  have now been   recognised  for  which\r\n\r\nstudents are asking for special accommodation.   So,  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  requests for special accommodation  do\r\n\r\ncome  from this wider range of conditions.  Not all these\r\n\r\nconditions  are completely well established.  Even  among\r\n\r\nthe medical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofessionals and the psychologists, there  may  be  some\r\n\r\ndisagreement as to the impact of these conditions on  the\r\n\r\nexaminations  which the student is taking, and  they  may\r\n\r\nwell  disagree  also  on the extent and  whether  or  not\r\n\r\naccommodations are justified.  So the Ministry is,  in  a\r\n\r\nsense,  in  a  rather difficult position.  And  even  the\r\n\r\ndoctors,    whom    the   parents   who    bring    their\r\n\r\nchildren/students to, are also in a difficult  situation,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  parents, obviously, would want  doctors  to\r\n\r\ncertify  their  children/students and  would  bring  such\r\n\r\ncertifications to the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some of these conditions, there is no clear-cut\r\n\r\ndecision  one  way  or  the  other.   And  the  kinds  of\r\n\r\naccommodations  the Ministry can make have  to  be  of  a\r\n\r\nrather  coarse  nature.  We cannot  say  that  with  this\r\n\r\ncondition,  we will give you two minutes extra  time  per\r\n\r\nhour.   This other condition, three minutes, four minutes\r\n\r\nor  five minutes.  It is very difficult to make such fine\r\n\r\nadjustments.   Basically, where there is  a  request  for\r\n\r\nextra time, generally, we give a student about 15 minutes\r\n\r\nextra  per hour.  So this is a coarse assessment, and  we\r\n\r\nare unable to make such fine assessments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The differentiation between mild, moderate and\r\n\r\nserious    is  very  judgmental.   Basically,  what   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has decided is that if the student  feels  that\r\n\r\nthe   condition  is  serious  enough  to  merit   special\r\n\r\narrangements, and if that is the case, then we  ought  to\r\n\r\nannotate it, because the condition is serious enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Khor asked what other countries practise\r\n\r\nannotation.  Annotation is practised in the UK  as  well.\r\n\r\nThe UK Examinations Board does so.  Dr Khor is right that\r\n\r\nthe  College  Board which runs the SAT 1 in  the  US  has\r\n\r\nrecently  been ordered by the courts in the  US  to  stop\r\n\r\nannotation.  Dr Khor is also correct that there have been\r\n\r\nconcerns  raised about whether this will cause  abuse  of\r\n\r\nthe  system.  If I may quote from an article in  the  New\r\n\r\nYork  Times  of 15th July by Tamar Lewin entitled  \"Abuse\r\n\r\nis feared as the SAT test changes disability policy\".  It\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"High school guidance counsellors have said that the\r\n\r\nelimination  of  flagging could set off  a  wave  of  new\r\n\r\napplications  for  accommodations,  including  some  from\r\n\r\nstudents without disabilities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Some college admission officers too say they worry\r\n\r\nabout  how the change will play out and whether  it  will\r\n\r\nlead   to  so  many  requests  for  extended  time   that\r\n\r\nultimately everyone will be allowed four or five hours on\r\n\r\na 3-hour exam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are real concerns about abuse, and it is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  to make a judgment on these  situations.\r\n\r\nBecause  some of the conditions are quite new ones  which\r\n\r\nare   not   completely  well  understood  even   by   the\r\n\r\nprofessionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether the Ministry is aware that in countries\r\n\r\nwhere  annotation is practised, such as in  the  US,  the\r\n\r\nlevel of special accommodation is generally higher.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  a dyslexic child is not only given  50%  extra\r\n\r\ntime, say, in the SAT test, but is also given a reader to\r\n\r\nread the questions, and a writer to write the answers  as\r\n\r\ndirected by the student.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask whether the Minister could\r\n\r\nactually  reconsider the accommodation provided  to  such\r\n\r\nstudents,  to see whether the same level of accommodation\r\n\r\ncan be given since annotation is here to stay.  So, it is\r\n\r\nnot  just  a  negative impact that the  disabled  student\r\n\r\nwould  receive.  In addition, he would be able  to  level\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, my Ministry is prepared to\r\n\r\nmake  special  accommodations.

This 1995 Code sets out the provisions  and\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  building facilities and  fixtures,  eg,\r\n\r\nramps,  toilets, lifts, public telephones,  signages,  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  needs of the disabled.  Hence, newer stations,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  those coming up in the North East Line and  the\r\n\r\nMRT  Extension  to Changi Airport are in compliance  with\r\n\r\nthis 1995 building Code.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the LTA has embarked on a major\r\n\r\nexercise  to  retrofit the existing stations with  lifts,\r\n\r\nramps   and  toilets  to  make  them  user-friendly   for\r\n\r\ncommuters  with disabilities.  This exercise is estimated\r\n\r\nto   cost   the  Government  about  $82  million.    When\r\n\r\ncompleted, the entire MRT system will be fully  disabled-friendly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of public buses, LTA mandates that they\r\n\r\nmust  have  low  floor boards so as to facilitate  easier\r\n\r\nboarding by the elderly and those with mild disabilities.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  we  are not able to  require  our  public\r\n\r\nbuses  to  kneel or come with special boarding  equipment\r\n\r\nfor  those  who are on wheelchairs.  This is because  our\r\n\r\npublic   bus   services   are   meant   for   the   rapid\r\n\r\ntransportation of the masses.  The priority is  to  speed\r\n\r\nup boarding and alighting.  Making our public buses cater\r\n\r\nto  the  needs of the wheelchair-bound will  impact  this\r\n\r\npriority.  This will affect the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncost  and  service  level to the large  majority  of  the\r\n\r\ncommuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A better way to address the needs of the wheelchair-bound is to provide a dedicated service for them. The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Community Development and Sports (MCDS)  has\r\n\r\ntherefore set up an Inter-Ministry Workgroup to look into\r\n\r\nthis  problem.   It  is  led by the National  Council  of\r\n\r\nSocial Services.  My Ministry and LTA are represented  in\r\n\r\nthe Workgroup.  And I understand that the Workgroup is in\r\n\r\nthe process of finalising its recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, it is one thing to have the infrastructure, except\r\n\r\nfor the public bus transport system, but it is another to\r\n\r\nmake  it affordable for the disabled and the increasingly\r\n\r\nageing  population  to utilise the  public  buses.   What\r\n\r\nschemes  are in place for the affordability of those  who\r\n\r\ncannot  access the public buses and would  have  to  take\r\n\r\nother  forms  of transportation, eg, taxis?  Because  the\r\n\r\nincreased cost of looking after and maintaining  oneself,\r\n\r\nif  one is disabled, is compounded by expensive transport\r\n\r\ncosts if no public transport means are available.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, how we should assist\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are disabled and, at  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nfinancially disadvantaged is a larger topic.  I think  it\r\n\r\nis  best addressed holistically.  I believe this  is  the\r\n\r\npurview  of my colleagues in MCDS working with  NCSS  and\r\n\r\nthe  various VWOs.  Whether financial assistance for them\r\n\r\nis  best focused on transport needs, medical treatment or\r\n\r\nskills training can then be examined on an overall basis.\r\n\r\nIn  my Ministry's primary focus, we have to target at the\r\n\r\nrapid  transportation of the masses.  We will as  far  as\r\n\r\npracticable accommodate, be sensitive and sympathetic  to\r\n\r\nthose  commuters with disabilities.  And I think we  have\r\n\r\nbeen improving over the years, as I elaborated earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> As public transport\r\n\r\noperators,  the bus companies, is there an obligation  on\r\n\r\ntheir  part  to  provide this service to  the  public  at\r\n\r\nlarge,  and  that includes the disabled and the  elderly?\r\n\r\nIf so, what measures is LTA having to ensure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  obligations of a public bus  operator  include\r\n\r\nhelping  financially, or in other ways, the disabled  and\r\n\r\nthe  elderly?  Otherwise, the cost will be passed  on  to\r\n\r\nthe  individual families and the disabled  themselves  or\r\n\r\nthe  VWOs,  who are already burdened with finding  enough\r\n\r\nfunds for the other services that they run.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether the Member was in this House when we had  a  very\r\n\r\nrobust  debate about transport fares and the role of  bus\r\n\r\noperators.   I think we all know that they are commercial\r\n\r\nentities,  they have to make ends meet.  My  Ministry  is\r\n\r\njust  a regulator of these licensees.  They have to  make\r\n\r\nends meet, and whether they should subsidise a particular\r\n\r\nsegment  of their passengers or commuters, we  know  that\r\n\r\nfinally  the overall cost has to be borne by the rest  of\r\n\r\nthe  commuters.   If Singaporeans, the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\ncommuters,  are  prepared  to cross-subsidise  the  other\r\n\r\nsmaller segment of the population who are disabled,  then\r\n\r\nthat is a different consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as I said, the overall issue of how we should\r\n\r\nassist  financially the disabled Singaporeans is a larger\r\n\r\nissue because their needs go beyond transport.  There may\r\n\r\nbe  medical  needs  and there may be  other  occupational\r\n\r\ntraining   needs.   I  think  it  is   best   looked   at\r\n\r\nholistically  and  the appropriate Ministry  to  look  at\r\n\r\nthat,  I believe, is MCDS.  I am just a SMS, Ministry  of\r\n\r\nTransport.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Under\r\n\r\nthe  directions of the Ministry in wanting a  world-class\r\n\r\ntransport system as well as a seamless transport  system,\r\n\r\nhow would the Ministry account for a good MRT system that\r\n\r\nis  currently  disabled-friendly in  terms  of  those  in\r\n\r\nwheelchairs?  When they get out of the MRT, there is  not\r\n\r\na  good public transport system as in buses to help them.\r\n\r\nWould  the  Ministry be looking into  perhaps  a  greater\r\n\r\nadvisory role where the PTC is concerned in this matter?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the\r\n\r\nMember's wish to make our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem  as  user-friendly to all and sundry.  After  all,\r\n\r\nevery Singaporean matters.  If they are unfortunate, have\r\n\r\ncertain  disabilities, we hope that we can  also  include\r\n\r\nthem  in the transport system.  I think that is an  ideal\r\n\r\nthat we should always strive for.  But to achieve such an\r\n\r\nideal requires the part to be played by many parties.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  just Government.  The corporate sector  is  also\r\n\r\ninvolved.   The NGOs are involved.  The people themselves\r\n\r\nare  involved, and even within the Government,  different\r\n\r\nMinistries  are involved.  MOT will play  its  part,  but\r\n\r\nmany other people will have to play their part too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottomline is this. If we look back today and,\r\n\r\nsay,  10  years  ago, I think we are a lot more  disabled\r\n\r\nuser-friendly now than 10 years ago, and we  continue  to\r\n\r\nmake improvements.  We cannot achieve it tomorrow, but we\r\n\r\nare  making  progress.   As  I  said,  the  existing  MRT\r\n\r\nstations  which  are  not yet disabled-friendly,  we  are\r\n\r\nputting  in  a  lot of resources to retrofit  them.   The\r\n\r\nwhole exercise should be completed by 2005; so that makes\r\n\r\nMRT disabled-friendly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus is quite a different story because to load the\r\n\r\nwhole  requirements onto the entire bus service has major\r\n\r\nimplications.   I  see  two  major  implications.    One,\r\n\r\nfinancially,  because  buses  which  are   made   to   be\r\n\r\nwheelchair-bound friendly are more expensive  than  those\r\n\r\nbuses which are not.  So, that will translate into higher\r\n\r\ncost,  and  that higher cost has to be borne by somebody.\r\n\r\nIt means the rest of the commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the time taken to board and to alight by\r\n\r\nthe  wheelchair-bound naturally is longer.  We can do  so\r\n\r\nin  MRT  because MRT has many doors, so that at the  same\r\n\r\ntime the disabled and those without disability can board.\r\n\r\nThe  whole process takes two to three minutes, and it  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  problem.  But for a bus, there is only one  door.\r\n\r\nAnd  one-at-a-time sequential alighting and boarding hold\r\n\r\nup  the whole traffic.  We are a very busy city.  If  you\r\n\r\nlook  at  our bus lanes, there are many buses  per  hour.\r\n\r\nThe frequencies are huge.  So once you pile up, it causes\r\n\r\nother kinds of problems.  And that is why it is not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurprising that in many other big cities, whether  it  is\r\n\r\nNew  York, London or wherever, they do not fully load the\r\n\r\nwheelchair  needs  onto the public bus  system,  although\r\n\r\nthey try to.  But, at the same time, they supplement with\r\n\r\ndedicated  bus services for the disabled.   And  I  think\r\n\r\nthat is where MCDS, working with NCSS, is working in that\r\n\r\ndirection.  I think that is the right direction to take.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my message is this. It is good to achieve door-to-door, curb-to-curb user-friendliness for all, but\r\n\r\neveryone has to play his or her part.  MOT will play  its\r\n\r\npart.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> I thank the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of State for clarifying that an alternative  to\r\n\r\nthe  bus  system is being pursued with maybe a  dedicated\r\n\r\nscheme,  rather than this public at large  scheme.   With\r\n\r\nregard  to that, the crucial aspect would be the cost  of\r\n\r\neven  providing a dedicated service.  If you look at  the\r\n\r\nNational  Council  of  Social  Service's  latest   annual\r\n\r\nreport, CommChest funds are used, that is, the public  at\r\n\r\nlarge funds are used to provide a public transport scheme\r\n\r\nfor  the  disabled.   This is where the  public  is  also\r\n\r\nplaying its part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just wondering what part would public bus\r\n\r\noperators be playing.  In the initial years when this was\r\n\r\nfirst  broached, there was actually funding from the  bus\r\n\r\noperators to start a fund for NCSS.  But my understanding\r\n\r\nis  that they have stopped providing this.  So the  whole\r\n\r\nburden is now loaded onto the individual, the family  and\r\n\r\nthe  public  at large.  I know, but I may be wrong  here,\r\n\r\nMCDS also has been trying its best to push this along but\r\n\r\nit  does  not seem to have much progress.  My concern  is\r\n\r\nthat  this  dedicated service would end up an interesting\r\n\r\nexercise  on paper.  But when it comes to implementation,\r\n\r\nthe wherewithal, the funds, would not be available.  What\r\n\r\nwould be the obligations for public bus operators to,  at\r\n\r\nleast,  help in supplementing or complementing the  funds\r\n\r\nrequired?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I really would\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  pre-empt the discussion about  the  inter-agency report, which is led by MCDS, because they are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstill  finalising their recommendations.  In due  course,\r\n\r\nmaybe  we  can have a discussion about it.  In any  case,\r\n\r\nNCSS does not come under MOT.  It comes under MCDS.   But\r\n\r\nthe  key  point  is this.  Yes, I think for  a  dedicated\r\n\r\nservice, funding is one of the key elements that  has  to\r\n\r\nbe  resolved.   Let MCDS and this Working  Group  discuss\r\n\r\nthrough on how they want to bring them about.  Obviously,\r\n\r\nit  has  to  come from various parties.   The  Member  is\r\n\r\nright.   He  quoted  the NCSS' annual report  about  they\r\n\r\nsetting aside a budget for transport needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current system is this. The various VWOs have\r\n\r\ntheir  own individual systems to serve their own members.\r\n\r\nIt  is  highly unsatisfactory because there are a lot  of\r\n\r\nduplication  and  wastages.  So I think what  the  inter-agency  Working Group is working towards is some sort  of\r\n\r\ncentralisation, so that it can be a shared  service  and,\r\n\r\nhopefully, we can cut down on duplication and stretch our\r\n\r\nlimited  dollar longer.  We hope that they  can  succeed.\r\n\r\nBut,  I  think,  implicit  in the Member's  supplementary\r\n\r\nquestion was, what is the role of the bus operator?   The\r\n\r\nbus  operator's role is to operate.  It is  an  operator.\r\n\r\nWe have a big debate in this House not too long ago.  Let\r\n\r\nus  acknowledge  that  different  people  play  different\r\n\r\nroles.   There  is  a regulator, there  is  a  commercial\r\n\r\nplayer,  and there will be NGOs with objectives  to  help\r\n\r\nand,  of  course, the passengers themselves  who  can  be\r\n\r\nmeans tested.  I think for a system to work properly,  we\r\n\r\nneed everyone to play his part.  I cannot play your part,\r\n\r\nneither can you play my part.  But I think when all of us\r\n\r\nplay in harmony, we would have a marvellous system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Just one point. The\r\n\r\narguments  that  were put forth by the Ministry  at  that\r\n\r\ntime  about three or four years ago, on whether to  allow\r\n\r\nMRT   trains  to  become  disabled-friendly,  sound  very\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  the  arguments that the Senior  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  is  presenting now.  For the public bus  companies\r\n\r\ntoo, we are talking about productivity, etc.  But it  was\r\n\r\ngood news that finally the MRT opens its doors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your question, Ms Braema?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Yes, I am coming to it.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry,  in  the  light of what  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports is proposing,  is  also\r\n\r\ntrying  to  look into flexi-hours.  And from these  PEC's\r\n\r\nrecommendations, would the Ministry perhaps align  itself\r\n\r\nto  look into flexi-hours where maybe such provision will\r\n\r\nnot affect productivity when it comes to public buses  as\r\n\r\nthe rush is not as severe?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I remind Members to make your\r\n\r\nquestions concise?  Please try to develop that skill,  so\r\n\r\nthat we can proceed with our Questions efficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> I do not know what transpired\r\n\r\nthree or four years ago.  That time I was up there in the\r\n\r\ngallery  happily as Permanent Secretary (MTI).  But  from\r\n\r\nwhat  I  could gather from the Member's comment, she  was\r\n\r\nsaying  that the arguments used by MCIT then against  MRT\r\n\r\nbeing   made   disabled-friendly   was   on   ground   of\r\n\r\nproductivity.  By that, I presume she meant fast loading,\r\n\r\nboarding  and alighting.  As I explained, I think  trains\r\n\r\nare  quite  different.  A train is not a  bus.   One  key\r\n\r\ndifference  is a train has many doors.  So, at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  you can admit and alight passengers easily.   Each\r\n\r\ntrain  has  to  stop  at a station for  at  least  a  few\r\n\r\nminutes.  So, even though a wheelchair-bound may take  up\r\n\r\nto  two  minutes, it is all right.  It does not  hold  up\r\n\r\ntraffic.  But buses are quite different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier I made the two implications - one is cost,\r\n\r\nand  the  other is time.  These are serious implications.\r\n\r\nThese are not frivolous that we imagine out of thin  air.\r\n\r\nThe  problem, therefore, cuts two ways.  Either there are\r\n\r\na lot of such users who are on wheelchair, in which case,\r\n\r\nthe  cost will be better spread out.  But if there are  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number of users, the problem of cumulative waiting\r\n\r\nbecomes a big one.  Or if the numbers are small, in which\r\n\r\ncase the impact on queuing or the productivity she talked\r\n\r\nabout  is marginal.  But in that case, the cost is  high.\r\n\r\nSo  it is no wonder that mature cities like New York  and\r\n\r\nLondon have come to the conclusion that they still need a\r\n\r\ndedicated  service.   Yes, they  will  try  to  make  the\r\n\r\nroutine bus service as friendly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  possible, but you have to override that, you have  to\r\n\r\nsupplement it.  In fact, more than supplement it, that is\r\n\r\nthe  dominant mode of travel.  It is a dedicated  service\r\n\r\nfor those on wheelchair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest we get carried away, the disabled is a whole\r\n\r\nspectrum  of people with different degrees of disability,\r\n\r\nfrom  mild to severe, and wheelchair-bound.  I think  for\r\n\r\nthe bulk of the disabled population, they can make use of\r\n\r\nour  public transport.  Years ago when I used to run more\r\n\r\nregularly, 10 km each time, I ran from my house in  Upper\r\n\r\nThomson  to  Newton  Circus, and I would  then  pass  the\r\n\r\njunction where the former Toa Payoh Hospital used to  be,\r\n\r\nand  the  Association  of  the  Visually  Handicapped  is\r\n\r\nlocated.  So, very often, I will encounter them alighting\r\n\r\nfrom  buses,  crossing  the  overhead  bridge,  and   the\r\n\r\npedestrian crossings, and they can do so unaided.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink what is more heartwarming for me is that, every now\r\n\r\nand  then,  I will see strangers who offer to  help  them\r\n\r\ncross  the  bridge, or the pedestrian crossing.   I  have\r\n\r\nplayed my part myself.  And I think this is what it ought\r\n\r\nto  be.  We all want a user-friendly system for all,  but\r\n\r\neveryone must play his part.  MOT will play its part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HDB HEADQUARTERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Vacation of Bukit Merah building)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational   Development  (a)  whether  the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board (HDB) Headquarters' move to  Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nwas well conceived as the vacated building in Bukit Merah\r\n\r\nis  still unoccupied; and (b) as retail businesses in the\r\n\r\nBukit  Merah  Central  area are suffering  as  a  result,\r\n\r\nwhether  HDB  had  anticipated the loss of  business  and\r\n\r\nplanned possible measures to revitalise the area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB decided in 1995 to\r\n\r\nmove  to  Toa Payoh.

The second question is what  is\r\n\r\nthe  loss in rental revenue where HDB is experiencing  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  for the past two months as a result  of  the\r\n\r\nvacancy?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> The Member is quite correct\r\n\r\nthat, obviously, there is an interest on the part of  the\r\n\r\nowner  of  the building to ensure that it is rented  out.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a free market economy and all of us  who\r\n\r\nhave ever been in a situation of having to rent out\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  property  will  know that we cannot  guarantee  that\r\n\r\nthere will be uninterrupted stream of tenants queueing up\r\n\r\noutside our door.  The decision to move was made in 1995,\r\n\r\nseven  years  ago.  At that point, things were  obviously\r\n\r\ndifferent.   But  even now, the real  issue  is:  is  HDB\r\n\r\ntrying  to  lease  out  the  vacant  premises?   We  have\r\n\r\nappointed  five marketing agents, and I am  sure  all  of\r\n\r\nthem  are  equally incentivised to find the right  tenant\r\n\r\nmix  for these premises.  So it is not a question of  HDB\r\n\r\njust  sitting back and leaving it vacant because  it  can\r\n\r\nafford to leave it vacant.  That is not the case at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have the figure that he is asking for as to\r\n\r\nhow  much  it is losing over the last few months.   In  a\r\n\r\nsense,  he  also has to realise that, in  a  free  market\r\n\r\neconomy,  the rental yields will fluctuate from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime.   So  if you ask me, even if I were to give  him  a\r\n\r\nfigure now, it would be an entirely notional figure.  The\r\n\r\nproof  of  the pudding ultimately is how much whoever  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  come in to these premises is willing  to  pay.\r\n\r\nAnd  we hope that, over the next few months, we will find\r\n\r\na tenant, or several tenants, who will take up the vacant\r\n\r\npremises.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> May I ask the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  whether  the old HDB headquarters in  Bukit  Merah\r\n\r\nCentral has two towers and three podiums with an area  of\r\n\r\n7,000 sq ft and looking at a rental rate of $1.50 per  sq\r\n\r\nft  per  month, and this works out to be almost a  rental\r\n\r\nincome  of  $1  million per month?

When\r\n\r\nsomeone will move in will depend also on the market.   So\r\n\r\nthere  is a limit to how much we can try to flog  a  dead\r\n\r\nhorse.  In this case, the premises are not dead.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nHDB has identified three possible causes for the breakage\r\n\r\nof tempered glass shower screens in HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Rough usage and improper renovation works by\r\n\r\nthe  flat-owner, which may cause chipping of  the  glass.\r\n\r\nOver time, the chips may develop into cracks, causing the\r\n\r\nglass  to  break suddenly when they widen  to  a  certain\r\n\r\ncrack width;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Deterioration or damage of the fitting\r\n\r\naccessories,  such  as the hinges or sliders,  which  may\r\n\r\ncause the glass panel to detach and break; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Presence of minute impurities within the glass\r\n\r\nthat  render  the  glass  more susceptible  to  breakage.\r\n\r\nBased  on  current  technology,  the  formation  of  such\r\n\r\nimpurities  during  the manufacturing process  cannot  be\r\n\r\ntotally eliminated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the causes of the breakage cannot be\r\n\r\nascertained conclusively, HDB's building contractors have\r\n\r\nreplaced,  and will replace, the glass doors  within  the\r\n\r\ndefects liability period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as a precautionary measure, HDB contractors\r\n\r\nhave started to inspect all HDB flats that were installed\r\n\r\nwith  tempered glass shower screens. The glass doors  and\r\n\r\nother fittings will be replaced, if necessary, at no cost\r\n\r\nto  the lessees.   Lessees of these units have also  been\r\n\r\nprovided  with  a usage and maintenance guide  to  advise\r\n\r\nthem  on  the safe and proper usage of the shower screen.\r\n\r\nIn  addition,  they  are  given the  particulars  of  the\r\n\r\noriginal  installer  of the shower screen  to  facilitate\r\n\r\nfuture maintenance of their shower screen, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since May 2000, 58 incidents of shattered tempered\r\n\r\nglass  shower  screens in HDB flats have  been  reported.\r\n\r\nThis  constitutes less than 0.2% of the total  number  of\r\n\r\nsets of shower screens installed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  may  I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary  what\r\n\r\nare  the  tender specifications for this tempered  glass?\r\n\r\nAre  the  specifications for HDB shower screens different\r\n\r\nfrom those for private condominiums?  Why are there fewer\r\n\r\ncases of shattered glass screens in private condominiums?\r\n\r\nSecondly,  are  there  any safety standards  which  these\r\n\r\ntempered  glass screens must comply with?

Thirdly, will the\r\n\r\nHDB  replace  not  just  the  glass  screens  which  have\r\n\r\nshattered but all those in the same batch of the contract\r\n\r\nas well?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member asked three questions.  Let me take the last\r\n\r\none first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB started putting in glass shower screens since\r\n\r\n1999.   We  have  installed something like 30,000  shower\r\n\r\nscreens  in 15,000 flats.  Usually, there are two showers\r\n\r\nin  each  flat.   We will inspect all the  30,000  shower\r\n\r\nscreens,  every single one - the fixtures and  the  glass\r\n\r\ndoors  -  before the end of October this year.   Improper\r\n\r\nfixtures  will be replaced.  If we can detect  any  glass\r\n\r\nimpurities  within  the expertise of the  contractor,  we\r\n\r\nwill  replace the tempered glass doors at no cost to  the\r\n\r\nlessee.   So, I hope Members are reassured of that.   And\r\n\r\nwe are replacing them expeditiously, as fast as we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I think the hon. Member is under the\r\n\r\nmisguided notion that private condominiums do not  suffer\r\n\r\nthe  same  fate.  They do.  In fact - without  mentioning\r\n\r\nnames   -   in  a  condominium  somewhere  in  north-east\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we have a 1% breakage of glass doors;   HDB's\r\n\r\nrecord  is 0.2%.  The contractors kept quiet.  Of course,\r\n\r\nI can give Members the list of names, etc, privately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shattering of glass screens is not uncommon. HDB is\r\n\r\nlate  in the game. It only started building glass  shower\r\n\r\ncurtains  in 1999, and tempered glass screen  doors  only\r\n\r\ncame  in  lately.   We did a search of the  Internet  and\r\n\r\nfound  that  this  subject  is something  that  has  been\r\n\r\npublished  in  the  New Scientist.  I will  circulate  it\r\n\r\nlater\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non.  It shows that such things happen.  Even high quality\r\n\r\ntempered, hardened glass doors shatter in different parts\r\n\r\nof the world randomly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any standards imposed? HDB, of course,\r\n\r\nhas  the  specifications.  I do  not  have  the  detailed\r\n\r\nspecifications.   The specification  is  that  they  must\r\n\r\nstand  up  to  a certain usage.  And the contractors  who\r\n\r\nsupply  these glass doors to HDB, supply the  same  glass\r\n\r\ndoors  to many of the condominiums in Singapore.   But  I\r\n\r\nwill give the hon. Member the specifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, may I know\r\n\r\nwhat  is the warranty period for these shower screens  in\r\n\r\nHDB  flats?   If  the  residents prefer  not  to  install\r\n\r\ntempered glass shower screens but prefer plastic  or  any\r\n\r\nother  type of material because they have senior citizens\r\n\r\nor  children at home, is that also permissible?  Will HDB\r\n\r\nreplace them, also at no cost?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> If the glass shatters\r\n\r\nwithin  the defects liability period, ie, one year  after\r\n\r\ntaking possession, we will replace them with no questions\r\n\r\nasked.   If it happens after the one-year period,  please\r\n\r\nlet  us know and we will see what we can do.  So far, all\r\n\r\nthe  shattered  glass screens have been  replaced  at  no\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question was that if the lessees want a\r\n\r\ndifferent  kind of replacement, eg, a plastic door,  yes,\r\n\r\nwe  are  accommodating.  But sometimes there  is  a  cost\r\n\r\ndifferential.  So, if it is cheaper than a glass door, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  no charge - FOC.  If it is more expensive,  then\r\n\r\nit is reasonable for the lessee to top up the difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Mr Speaker, tempered glass is not\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  shatter, that is why it is called  tempered\r\n\r\nglass.   It has certain reinforcements in the glass.   It\r\n\r\nis  supposed  to  just have a crack, unless  some  direct\r\n\r\nforce  is applied.  So, I do not understand what are  the\r\n\r\ncauses  for  the  shattering of tempered glass  in  those\r\n\r\nunits.   Also,  knowing  the  activities,  normally   the\r\n\r\nspecifications  will  specify the thickness  and  whether\r\n\r\narmour-shield or tempered.  So, if the cause  is  due  to\r\n\r\nimpurities, that means that the whole\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30,000  glass  doors may shatter, and  that  could  be  a\r\n\r\nsafety problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how can the HDB check the integrity of\r\n\r\nthese  glass  doors  for the shower rooms?   It  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to check the impurities in glass.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as to the 1% breakage in private\r\n\r\ncondominiums, the private developer concerned may be  one\r\n\r\nof  the  not-so-up-to-quality developers.  The HDB should\r\n\r\nnot use that as a benchmark.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do\r\n\r\nnot know which discipline the hon. Member comes from, but\r\n\r\nhe  does  not know much about tempered glass.  I hate  to\r\n\r\ngive a technical presentation on how tempered glass comes\r\n\r\nabout,  but  I  will just read a paragraph from  the  New\r\n\r\nScientist.  It reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Tempered glass is found everywhere from cars and\r\n\r\nbus shelters to the windows, walls and roofs of thousands\r\n\r\nof  buildings around the world. It is easy  to  see  why.\r\n\r\nThis glass has five times the strength of standard glass,\r\n\r\nand  when  it  does break, it shatters  into  tiny  cubes\r\n\r\nrather than large razor-sharp shards.  Architects love it\r\n\r\nbecause  large  panels  can be bolted  together  to  make\r\n\r\ntransparent  walls,  and turning  it  into  ceilings  and\r\n\r\nfloors is almost as easy.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it made of?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is made of heating a sheet of ordinary glass to\r\n\r\nabout 620oC to soften it slightly, allowing its structure\r\n\r\nto  expand, and then cooling it rapidly with jets of cold\r\n\r\nair ...\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on and on. I can give a copy of the article\r\n\r\nto the hon. Member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The problem starts when glass contains nickel\r\n\r\nsulphide impurities.  Trace amounts of nickel and sulphur\r\n\r\nare often present in the raw materials used to make glass\r\n\r\n....\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is inherent in the glass. What is glass made of?\r\n\r\nNickel and sulphide.  And they are impurities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is how is it possible to detect\r\n\r\nglass  doors  which might crack?  We do  our  best.   The\r\n\r\npercentage  of  shattering is very  miniscule.   We  will\r\n\r\ncarefully check for fine cracks.  Many of the glass doors\r\n\r\nshatter not because of impurities.  Some of them are  due\r\n\r\nto wear and tear.  We do not know.  Once it is shattered,\r\n\r\nwe cannot trace whether it is wear and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntear or whether it is due to impurities.  So, we look for\r\n\r\nfixtures - whether they are properly installed.  We  know\r\n\r\nit  can.   The  contractors have  experienced  installing\r\n\r\nhundreds   of   thousands  of  glass   doors   throughout\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  HDB is actually a small player  in  this\r\n\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nSenior  Parliamentary Secretary what is  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\ninstalling tempered glass in shower screens?  What is the\r\n\r\ntempered glass supposed to perform in the shower screens?\r\n\r\nHe  still  has  not given the answer as to what  are  the\r\n\r\ncauses  of  the  glass shattering.  If you  look  at  the\r\n\r\nphotograph  in  the  Straits  Times,  they  were   really\r\n\r\nshattered.  Maybe  he can explain how HDB  inspectors  or\r\n\r\ncontractors  inspect the rest of the shower  screens  and\r\n\r\ngive  an assurance to the residents that after inspection\r\n\r\nor  testing by the checkers, they will be all  right  and\r\n\r\nthey will not shatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> My answer is: trust us.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to trust the contractors because they have  the\r\n\r\nexperience.    Will   the  glass   door   shatter   after\r\n\r\ninspection?   Unlikely, but it can happen.  There  is  no\r\n\r\n100%  assurance.   But  we will do  our  best.   We  must\r\n\r\nremember that there are potentially thousands of  defects\r\n\r\nin  a  building  due  to  wear and  tear  and  we  cannot\r\n\r\nguarantee that none of these defects will occur at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, my question is: will tempered glass shatter? We have an engineer by\r\n\r\ntraining  here  who says that tempered glass  should  not\r\n\r\nshatter  but the fact is that it has shattered.  So  will\r\n\r\ntempered glass shatter?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Tempered glass should not\r\n\r\nshatter but because of the intrinsic traces of nickel and\r\n\r\nsulphur,  it can shatter in a small number of cases.   It\r\n\r\ndoes not happen just in HDB flats.  It happens in private\r\n\r\ncondominiums.  It happens all over the world, in Britain,\r\n\r\nAustralia and America.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I think the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary has not answered my  question  on\r\n\r\nwhat is the purpose of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntempered glass as shower screens.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> In fact, tempered glass\r\n\r\nis  safer than ordinary glass because when ordinary glass\r\n\r\ncracks, it cracks in fairly huge pieces with sharp  razor\r\n\r\ncorners.  If you are not careful, when you lean on to it,\r\n\r\nit cracks and it can pierce you.  In the case of tempered\r\n\r\nglass,  when  it  cracks,  it cracks  into  thousands  of\r\n\r\npieces.  Of course, it can still hurt you once in a while\r\n\r\nbut  it  is safer.  It is hard, it is safe. When it  does\r\n\r\ncrack,  it  shatters into thousands of pieces, just  like\r\n\r\nyour  car  windscreen.  Why do the car manufacturers  not\r\n\r\nuse  ordinary glass?  Because in an accident,  they  will\r\n\r\nshatter  and it will not pierce you.  You might still  be\r\n\r\nhurt   by   the  shattered  pieces,  rather  than   sharp\r\n\r\ntriangular  pieces that will pierce your face.   That  is\r\n\r\nthe  answer.   In  fact, tempered  glass  is  safer  than\r\n\r\nordinary glass.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc.

We are also reconsidering  the  use  of\r\n\r\nglass  per  se.   We may move on to acrylic.  Acrylic  is\r\n\r\nexpensive, and also over time, it loses its transparency,\r\n\r\nit   becomes  yellowish.

The other question is  I\r\n\r\nread  in  the Straits Times yesterday that they had  some\r\n\r\ntests  for this kind of glass.  I think it is a  kind  of\r\n\r\nstress test.  Does HDB also conduct stress tests on  some\r\n\r\nof   these  products?   Because  it  appears  that   some\r\n\r\ncontractors,  to  reduce  costs,  actually  import   sub-standard products and some of these products may get into\r\n\r\nthe HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

But  it\r\n\r\ndoes not eliminate completely the presence of nickel  and\r\n\r\nsulphur  altogether.  In other words, the possibility  of\r\n\r\ncracking  will  be  reduced.

It is  therefore  not\r\n\r\npractical  for  outgoing divorcees to  retain  ownership,\r\n\r\nsince  this  would render them ineligible to buy  another\r\n\r\nflat  in  the future.  And in any case, there is also  no\r\n\r\nguarantee that granting such joint ownership of HDB flats\r\n\r\nto  divorcees would really make any difference as far  as\r\n\r\nthe reduction of custody disputes is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NEW CHARTER OF GOVERNMENT-LINKED COMPANIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of Debate on Question\r\n\r\n[27th August, 2002],\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House, taking into account the Report of\r\n\r\nthe   Entrepreneurship   and  Internationalisation   Sub-Committee (EISC) of the Economic Review Committee and the\r\n\r\npress  release by Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd on  the  new\r\n\r\ncharter of the Government-linked companies (GLCs) and  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the  concerns of the private  sector  regarding\r\n\r\nGLCs,    urges   the   Government   to   implement    the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the EISC which define  the  new  roles\r\n\r\nand  positioning of the Government and GLCs  in  business\r\n\r\nand,   in   so  doing,  support  the  growth  of  private\r\n\r\nenterprise  and  entrepreneurship in Singapore.\".  -  [Mr\r\n\r\nLeong Horn Kee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.55 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate  today.  I would like to declare my interests.   I\r\n\r\nam  the  Group CEO and President of the Hyflux  Group  of\r\n\r\ncompanies, established in 1989 as Hydrochem (S) Pte  Ltd.\r\n\r\nHyflux  has  progressed from being a small  establishment\r\n\r\nproviding  integrated  water  treatment  systems   to   a\r\n\r\nmembrane specialist company, listed on SESDAQ in  January\r\n\r\n2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this perspective, I would like to share my\r\n\r\nthoughts  as a Singaporean, as an entrepreneur and  as  a\r\n\r\nbusiness person. This debate, I feel, has focused  a  lot\r\n\r\non GLCs' predominance in the Singapore business scene.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to offer some business perspectives of  GLCs.\r\n\r\nCompared   with   the  average  stated-owned   enterprise\r\n\r\nworldwide,  our GLCs are amongst the finest and  best-run\r\n\r\nin  the  world.  They are highly organised,  transparent,\r\n\r\naccountable  and profitable.  From our nation's  founding\r\n\r\nyears,  our  GLCs  were  part and  parcel  of  what  made\r\n\r\nSingapore the success it is today.  Indeed, our GLCs were\r\n\r\noriginally the main engines of growth and development  in\r\n\r\nmany sectors, including infrastructure and industry. They\r\n\r\nprovided the much needed employment and stability for our\r\n\r\ncountry and our citizens.  For all these reasons, we,  as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  should and must always be appreciative  and\r\n\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big question is not whether our GLCs were the\r\n\r\nright  engines of Singapore's original growth  which,  in\r\n\r\nmany  ways,  I personally believe they were, but  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are still the right engines for Singapore's  future\r\n\r\neconomic  success  in an increasingly competitive  global\r\n\r\narena.   If  they are, we need to define in which  areas.\r\n\r\nIf   they  are  not,  again,  we  need  to  define  which\r\n\r\nparticular areas and how we should move forward.   If  we\r\n\r\nsincerely  believe  that  one  of  the  most  significant\r\n\r\nengines  of  growth  in  a  new age  economy  is  budding\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  and  private  enterprise,  we  need  to\r\n\r\nexamine whether our GLCs in various instances, are indeed\r\n\r\ncrowding  out  and  stifling these  engines  we  need  to\r\n\r\nsupport and grow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that if truly provided\r\n\r\nwith  a  level playing field, and Singapore entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nstill cannot fight and beat the GLCs at contracts on home\r\n\r\nground,  and  in  their own field  of  expertise,  it  is\r\n\r\nunlikely  that  they  would  succeed  against  far   more\r\n\r\naggressive  foreign players in a global market  and  vice\r\n\r\nversa.  This same rule applies to our GLCs as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind, we must still always remember the\r\n\r\nwar  is  out there, not here in Singapore.  We  need  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to provide a level playing field and  a  good\r\n\r\nbusiness  platform for all, not only SMEs but also  MNCs,\r\n\r\nGLCs,  TLCs  and  NLCs.  This is  why  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the  EISC for having thoroughly  considered\r\n\r\nand  completed  the  excellent report  on  Government  in\r\n\r\nbusiness.  The  recommendations are as  comprehensive  as\r\n\r\nthey  are  diverse, and they have left  almost  no  stone\r\n\r\nunturned.  At the same time, they reflect a very  serious\r\n\r\ngrasp of the issues at stake, and propose solutions  that\r\n\r\nare  both  practical and responsible. As  such,  I  fully\r\n\r\nendorse  the  motion to implement the recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe  EISC.   I would like to offer my compelling  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy I fully support the motion, particularly at this time\r\n\r\nin Singapore's history.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, there is an urgent need to quench the\r\n\r\nthirst of the local SMEs and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate enterprises.  Let me elaborate on my first  point\r\n\r\nwith an analogy of the desert, thunder and rain.  We have\r\n\r\njust  been  through  one  of the  worst  patches  in  our\r\n\r\neconomic  history.  The economic downturn  has  hit  many\r\n\r\nenterprises in an unprecedented manner, especially  among\r\n\r\nlocal  SMEs  and many are still hurting.  If  I  were  to\r\n\r\ndescribe to you the Singapore business landscape  through\r\n\r\nthe  eyes  of  the  business community, particularly  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, you will see a desert  -  a parched  and\r\n\r\ndried  up  desert  in which many are  now  thirsting  for\r\n\r\nsomething real, something concrete, something to  believe\r\n\r\nin again, and then to move forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking my analogy further, the desert has been\r\n\r\ncaused   by  a  multitude  of  factors,  including   MNCs\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  exodus  to greener pastures  in  low-cost\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  countries such  as  China.   It  has  been\r\n\r\nworsened by global cost cutting and consolidation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on to thunder before the rain. I would\r\n\r\nreally  describe  the  recommendations  of  the  EISC  as\r\n\r\nthunder  before the long-awaited rainfall on our  parched\r\n\r\nand  drying desert of private enterprises.  To the  weary\r\n\r\nbusinessman  and  to  the  budding  entrepreneur,   these\r\n\r\nrecommendations are indeed like thunder.   I  choose  the\r\n\r\nword \"thunder\" with much deliberation.  Thunder announces\r\n\r\nthe   onset  of  much  needed  rainfall  to  refresh  and\r\n\r\nrejuvenate parched soil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on to the rain. Unfortunately, to the\r\n\r\nsceptics  and  cynics, thunder may  not  always  lead  to\r\n\r\nrainfall  where  it  is needed.  Winds  of  change  could\r\n\r\nindeed  sweep away the clouds of promise to other  areas.\r\n\r\nLocal  SMEs and the private sector in general are  hoping\r\n\r\nand waiting for the rain.  The rain that they are longing\r\n\r\nfor  is  the implementation of the recommended  measures.\r\n\r\nThat  is all that is needed  - this window of opportunity\r\n\r\n-  speaking as an entrepreneur, speaking for the  private\r\n\r\nbusiness community.  All true blue business persons  know\r\n\r\nhow  to  capture  the rain and to use it,  store  it  and\r\n\r\nharness  its productivity, and maybe recycle it.   And  I\r\n\r\ndare say, even bring some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  this  water in their journeys far and wide, searching\r\n\r\nout new lands of promise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often heard the following: \"If you have a\r\n\r\ngood idea, a good product, or a good technology that  can\r\n\r\nsurely  make  money,  do not let the GLCs  and  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  find out about it.  Or they will try to get  hold\r\n\r\nof  your  technology  or idea and  compete  with  you  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And how to compete with them?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I spoke to a friend to encourage him to\r\n\r\nstart  his  own business. But his father discouraged  him\r\n\r\nsaying that in Singapore, he would lose to the GLCs.   It\r\n\r\nwould be better for him to either be employed by them  or\r\n\r\njoin an MNC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above views reflect the general perception among\r\n\r\nsome  Singaporeans, even though they are  unjustified  in\r\n\r\nmany   cases.    In   Singapore's  drive   to   encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship,  this perception is counter  productive\r\n\r\nbut, unfortunately, real.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a rapidly changing global environment, the\r\n\r\nprivate sector has a much bigger role to play in reacting\r\n\r\nto  innovation and rapidly changing market  trends.   The\r\n\r\nTemasek  Charter has refocused the role of our GLCs.   It\r\n\r\nencourages the GLCs to focus on their core business,  and\r\n\r\nexpand globally.  This is a much awaited move.  This move\r\n\r\nwill  help convince the SMEs that GLCs would not encroach\r\n\r\ninto the already highly crowded domestic market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I endorse the Yellow Pages rule that Government\r\n\r\nagencies  should not set up enterprises  in  areas  where\r\n\r\nprivate sector players are able to play a part.  Instead,\r\n\r\nthe Government agencies should see these as opportunities\r\n\r\nto provide business for the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An equally compelling reason for the speedy\r\n\r\nimplementation of the EISC recommendations is the  urgent\r\n\r\nneed  to  groom and grow our own local global  champions.\r\n\r\nThe  truth  is that in whatever global business  you  are\r\n\r\ninvolved  in, you must be either number 1,  2  or  3,  by\r\n\r\nsheer size and strength, or through agility and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuperior  knowledge, failing which you have  to  redefine\r\n\r\nyour  niche  in  that sector and then  strive  to  become\r\n\r\nnumber  1,  2  or  3 again.  Failing this,  you  have  to\r\n\r\nredefine  or create a new sector in which you can  excel.\r\n\r\nFailing  all of the above, you need to admit  defeat  and\r\n\r\nbow out.  Your guess is probably as good as mine how many\r\n\r\nand  which Singapore companies will eventually emerge  as\r\n\r\nglobal winners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We honestly cannot predict whether it will be the\r\n\r\nGLCs,  SMEs  or  larger  private corporations  that  will\r\n\r\nemerge  as  champions.  But we do need winners  urgently,\r\n\r\nand I believe we should cast our net as wide as possible.\r\n\r\nLet the GLCs try, let the SMEs try, and let everyone try.\r\n\r\nWe  do  know  that market forces dictate that enterprises\r\n\r\nwhich  respond the fastest to change, which can  continue\r\n\r\nto  renew  themselves, will survive and  thrive  in  this\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.  We have to move fast or we will\r\n\r\nbe  left behind.  We cannot afford to lose these few good\r\n\r\nyears  as  we either capture our share of the  market  or\r\n\r\nrisk losing our position.  As aptly put by journalist, Mr\r\n\r\nLee Han Shih, \"Time is a luxury Singapore can't afford.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the city of Shanghai, for example. Anyone who\r\n\r\nhas been to Shanghai over the last 3-5 years will see how\r\n\r\nrapid  the  development there has been.  Private  Chinese\r\n\r\nenterprises are moving with equal speed and  resolve.   A\r\n\r\nprime  example  is  China's Hai'er  Group.   One  of  the\r\n\r\nlargest  household domestic appliance vendors  in  China,\r\n\r\nHai'er  is  something  of  a local  hero  among  economic\r\n\r\nreformers.   It is known for its dramatic revenue  growth\r\n\r\nand  market-driven  approach through its  strong  service\r\n\r\nnetwork.   Even major foreign players such  as  Dell  and\r\n\r\nCompaq have to reckon with Hai'er as a keen competitor in\r\n\r\nthe   huge  Chinese  PC  market.   Traditional  household\r\n\r\nappliance  manufacturers  such as  General  Electric  and\r\n\r\nAriston  now  have  to sit up and take  heed  of  a  once\r\n\r\nunheard  of brand, even in their home markets of the  USA\r\n\r\nand Europe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have a very limited base of\r\n\r\nenterprises.  Besides having to compete with  established\r\n\r\nnames,  we  now  have to even compete  with  fast  rising\r\n\r\nnewcomers such as Hai'er.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have always done things the\r\n\r\nSingapore  way,  and  rightly so,  simply  because  every\r\n\r\ncountry's journey on the road to success is different and\r\n\r\nunique.   Singaporeans  share an unusual  heritage  as  a\r\n\r\nnation.  We always trust the Government to look after us,\r\n\r\ndo  the  best things for us and at the right time.   Many\r\n\r\nhave  criticised this over dependency on the  Government.\r\n\r\nThough  most would not readily admit to it, we know  that\r\n\r\nit  is  this relationship between the Government and  the\r\n\r\npeople that has made Singapore what it is today.   It  is\r\n\r\nprecisely because of this that the business community has\r\n\r\noverwhelmingly  come forward to work with the  Government\r\n\r\non  the  remaking of our economic future.  What they  are\r\n\r\nlooking   for  is  not  simply  hand-outs  but  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to create more opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the time has come for the private\r\n\r\nsector  to  take on a more significant role  in  building\r\n\r\ncorporate Singapore.  I believe we are ready and we  have\r\n\r\nto  be,  not only because private enterprise in Singapore\r\n\r\nneeds  this  but  perhaps,  more  importantly,  corporate\r\n\r\nSingapore  urgently needs to be relevant  in  the  global\r\n\r\nbusiness  arena.   More  than ever  before,  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  needs the space to grow and, in return, I believe\r\n\r\nthe  private sector will not disappoint in taking up  the\r\n\r\nchallenge.   The Singapore business community  is  urging\r\n\r\nthe  Government to implement the recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nEISC  speedily  in order to help quench the  dry  ground.\r\n\r\nThe  community surely does not want thunder  without  the\r\n\r\npromise  of rain.  The rain which comes needs  to  be  in\r\n\r\nsufficient volumes to penetrate the dry earth.  It cannot\r\n\r\nbe  a  passing drizzle.  It must be sustainable and  must\r\n\r\nlast long enough for the ground to absorb it, and for new\r\n\r\nseeds of enterprise to germinate.  Therefore, I urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to implement the measures recommended fast.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that if the rain comes, we will all look back  at\r\n\r\nthis milestone and, in its place, find an oasis that  has\r\n\r\nmoved us along in our nation's journey to success.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nme  to join in this debate.  I declare my interest as  an\r\n\r\nindependent director of SMRT Corporation, a subsidiary of\r\n\r\nTemasek Holdings Limited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Members of this House have debated\r\n\r\neloquently  on  the  two issues,  firstly,  the  role  of\r\n\r\nGovernment in business and, secondly, supporting  private\r\n\r\nenterprise and entrepreneurship, as reported by EISC  and\r\n\r\nits  recommendations on Government in business.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink this must be set against the bigger picture of  the\r\n\r\nremaking  of  the  Singapore  economy,  and  as  we  face\r\n\r\nsquarely the challenges of the great uncertainty  of  the\r\n\r\nworld economy and fierce competition ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that many of us in the private sector\r\n\r\nwill  agree with EISC that the Government should only  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  business  where it achieves  its  strategic\r\n\r\nobjectives,  such as managing critical resources,  public\r\n\r\npolicy objectives and developing new growth engines.  And\r\n\r\nthat  such  involvement  should cease  when  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  has developed capability and is ready  to  assume\r\n\r\nsuch role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that EISC has clearly defined what\r\n\r\ntype of business the Government should be in and what  it\r\n\r\nshould  keep out of, and therefore setting clear  markers\r\n\r\nwithin  which  the GLCs should operate henceforth.   EISC\r\n\r\nhas  adequately  addressed the concern  of  crowding  out\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise by the over dominance of  GLCs.   The\r\n\r\nprivate  sector will be relieved to note  that  EISC  has\r\n\r\nstated  that  the Government no longer needs  to  take  a\r\n\r\nhands on approach and should encourage private sector  to\r\n\r\nbe in the forefront of developing new business ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members of the House have spoken with\r\n\r\npassion  on  the considerable public unease and  concerns\r\n\r\nover  GLCs.  Whilst some of these concerns are  based  on\r\n\r\nfacts  and  some  on perceptions, but  whether  facts  or\r\n\r\nperceptions,  they  are  real  issues  with  the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  as we have earlier heard from Ms Lum.  The  EISC\r\n\r\nReport, if adopted by the Government, will certainly help\r\n\r\nto  allay  the major concerns of the private sector.   It\r\n\r\nwill give a lot of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomfort  to the private sector to know that they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave to compete head on with GLCs in the domestic market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generic competition law to be introduced and an\r\n\r\nindependent Fair Competition Authority to be  set  up  by\r\n\r\nthe Government will go one step further to ensure a level\r\n\r\nplaying field and fair competition.  However, I think  we\r\n\r\nmust  all be aware, as businesses are aware, that a level\r\n\r\nplaying  field does not mean protection from  competition\r\n\r\n-   domestic, foreign or from GLCs.  When there is  money\r\n\r\nto  be  made, the Starbucks, the Ikeas, the 7-Elevens  of\r\n\r\nthe world will come in and compete against our home-grown\r\n\r\ncoffee  clubs,  furniture and provision shops  for  their\r\n\r\nmarket  share.   The competition, whether  from  GLCs  or\r\n\r\nothers,  will  be  keen, and if our  private  enterprises\r\n\r\ncannot stand up to this competition, they will perish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, notwithstanding competition from\r\n\r\nGLCs  and  overseas  investors, our  private  sector  has\r\n\r\nproven  its  resilience  and  ability  to  stand  up   to\r\n\r\ncompetition.  Today, the SMEs are providing  70%  of  the\r\n\r\njobs for our workforce.  The challenge for our Government\r\n\r\nis  to  support  the  private sector  and  encourage  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial spirit to flourish, so that  the  private\r\n\r\nsector will continue to be the pillar of our economy  and\r\n\r\nwill succeed in their efforts to expand overseas.\r\n\r\nAt  the  end of May, Temasek's top seven listed companies\r\n\r\naccounted  for  21%  or  $72  billion  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nExchange market capitalisation of $342 billion.  The  top\r\n\r\n<br><br>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLCs, as we have heard several times, contributed 13%\r\n\r\nto  Singapore's GDP in 1998.  Despite the many misgivings\r\n\r\nover  GLCs,  I would like to see the GLCs as one  of  our\r\n\r\nimportant  assets,  and  a very powerful  tool  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has, and can use and must use to  expand  our\r\n\r\nexternal economy.  The Hai'er group in China that Ms  Lum\r\n\r\njust mentioned is one of the state-owned enterprises that\r\n\r\nhas been privatised.  They are not only successful in the\r\n\r\nChinese market itself but they have since expanded  their\r\n\r\nmanufacturing base to America.  Sir, I think there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  many of these examples around, and our GLCs  can  be\r\n\r\nthe Hai'er of Singapore as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skills, core competency and financial muscle matter\r\n\r\nmost  in venturing overseas successfully.  It is a  tough\r\n\r\nworld  out  there,  and for those of  us  who  have  been\r\n\r\noverseas,  we  all  know that there is  really  no  level\r\n\r\nplaying  field.   It is true that GLCs  have  their  fair\r\n\r\nshare  of failures expanding overseas in the past.  There\r\n\r\nare  lessons learnt, and it is part of business.   If  we\r\n\r\nexpect  our  GLCs  to  be  the driver  for  our  external\r\n\r\neconomy,  we  must also expect a fair share  of  failures\r\n\r\nfrom   them.    For   GLCs  to  successfully   lead   our\r\n\r\ninternational  expansion, they also must  have  the  same\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  spirit and the ability  to  take  risk,\r\n\r\nwhich means, to accept some failures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the publication of the EISC report, Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings has responded with a new Temasek Charter.   Some\r\n\r\nhave felt that this new charter may not fully reflect the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the EISC.  In particular, it is silent\r\n\r\non  divestment of non-strategic business.  I am sure that\r\n\r\nif  the  Government  accepts this report,  and  I  am  an\r\n\r\noptimist,   it   would  then  become   the   Government's\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  ensure  the  compliance  of  GLCs  to\r\n\r\noperate within its new role.  I am also sure that Members\r\n\r\nof  this House will make effective monitoring of the work\r\n\r\nof  GLCs  and  also  of its divestment  of  non-strategic\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members have commented that there is a\r\n\r\nneed  for greater transparency for GLCs.  I believe  that\r\n\r\nGLCs  do have a corporate image problem, as they seem  to\r\n\r\nring-fence  themselves.  I think perhaps it  would  help,\r\n\r\nespecially  for  listed  GLCs, to become  good  corporate\r\n\r\ncitizens,  to  be  more  involved  with  community,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  to  actively support sports, arts and  culture.\r\n\r\nMaybe  it  is  a  good start with football or  badminton.\r\n\r\nSenior  executives of GLCs can also follow the  footsteps\r\n\r\nof  those in the private sector and become volunteers  in\r\n\r\ncommunity service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in January this year, as Chairman of Network\r\n\r\nChina,  I  led a business delegation to Beijing,  Qingdao\r\n\r\nand Jinan to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexplore   business  opportunities  arising  from  Beijing\r\n\r\nhosting the 2008 Olympic Games.  The delegation consisted\r\n\r\nof  72  companies, 100 businessmen and women  and  senior\r\n\r\nexecutives  from both the private sector and  GLCs,  with\r\n\r\nstaff  support from IE Singapore.  Some of the  companies\r\n\r\nwent  belong  to  the ST Group.  Some of those  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  were  BreadTalk,  Hyflux.   There   were\r\n\r\nengineers,  there  were  construction  firms.   We   were\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  many  projects  and  potential,  eg,   in\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,  transport,  communication,   environment\r\n\r\nprotection.  While there are plenty of opportunities, the\r\n\r\ndelegation  also  found  that  many  of  these  potential\r\n\r\nprojects  require a huge capital investment or capability\r\n\r\nand  skills  beyond that of a single company.   Delegates\r\n\r\nthemselves and, in some cases, with encouragement from IE\r\n\r\nSingapore,   form  partnership  and  pool  resources   to\r\n\r\ncompete.   This  is  indeed a good example  of  GLCs  and\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  companies  working  together,  with   IE\r\n\r\nSingapore acting as a catalyst.  When I see them  working\r\n\r\ntogether, I do not really see a great divide between  the\r\n\r\nGLCs   and  the  private  sector.   I  see  a  group   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   working  together,  sharing   the   common\r\n\r\nobjective of fighting for business opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that these companies continue to\r\n\r\nnetwork and work quite closely together, even after their\r\n\r\nreturn to Singapore.  Sir, the culture of partnership  as\r\n\r\nenvisaged by EISC is important to Singapore companies  if\r\n\r\nthey wish to compete successfully overseas.  I agree with\r\n\r\nEISC that IE Singapore and SPRING have important roles to\r\n\r\nplay to identify and catalyse the development of specific\r\n\r\nindustry classes for our international expansion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthank  you for allowing me to participate in the  debate.\r\n\r\nI  have  been  sitting  here in my corner  in  Parliament\r\n\r\nlistening to the debate as it goes along.  And I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure that this debate about GLCs versus private sector is\r\n\r\nreally the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorrect issue.  The Motion is that, having regard to  the\r\n\r\nTemasek  Charter  and  the EISC  report,  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  implement the recommendations in the EISC report.\r\n\r\nThe  way the debate has gone seems to suggest that  there\r\n\r\nis some inconsistency between the two.  Frankly, I see no\r\n\r\ninconsistency.  The EISC report recommends  that  Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings  scale up their core businesses, not enter  into\r\n\r\nunrelated    business,   that    they    should    expand\r\n\r\ninternationally, explore divestment, attract  world-class\r\n\r\ntalent  into the GLCs, follow the Yellow Pages rules,  do\r\n\r\nnot  corporatise  or privatise the regulatory  functions,\r\n\r\nconduct   mandatory   periodic  housekeeping,   outsource\r\n\r\nGovernment's  functions  and define  specifications  more\r\n\r\nbroadly to provide opportunities for SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temasek Charter, as far as I can see, is quite\r\n\r\nconsistent.   It talks about having Government  ownership\r\n\r\nand  control for the critical or strategic businesses  or\r\n\r\nareas.   It talks about going international and regional,\r\n\r\nwhen  necessary,  to grow, and it is open  to  partnering\r\n\r\nother  companies to regionalise or internationalise,  and\r\n\r\nit  also  talks about divestment.  So, I do not  see  any\r\n\r\ninconsistency between the two reports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what is the fuss about GLCs versus private\r\n\r\nsector?   As I understand it, the thrust of the arguments\r\n\r\nappears  to  be that (1)  Government should  get  out  of\r\n\r\nbusiness; (2)  GLCs are squeezing out the local companies\r\n\r\nbecause  they are bigger and have more financial muscles;\r\n\r\n(3)   GLCs have more connections, they have the old boys'\r\n\r\nnetwork, and all things being equal, contracts will go to\r\n\r\nthem;  (4)  GLCs are sucking up all the talent;  and  (5)\r\n\r\nGLCs  are  inefficient.  Now, when you make  an  argument\r\n\r\nlike that and you put forward suggestions to remedy these\r\n\r\nevils,  you have to have an inherent consistency in  your\r\n\r\nargument.  And I have some serious difficulties with  the\r\n\r\narguments that have been put forward in support of  these\r\n\r\narguments.   If you run through this list and you  wonder\r\n\r\nwhy  its  sounds very familiar, that is basically because\r\n\r\nit  has a Star War theme about it.  The GLCs are the evil\r\n\r\nempire and the private sector is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  struggling rebels, I suppose, fighting  against  the\r\n\r\nevil empire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just examine a few of these propositions that\r\n\r\nhave been put forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it was suggested that GLCs are sucking up the\r\n\r\ntalent.   If  we  did not create GLCs, we  would  have  a\r\n\r\nlarger pool of entrepreneurs and the rise of GLCs has led\r\n\r\nto  the  death of the entrepreneurs and monopoly  of  top\r\n\r\nbrains  by  the civil service.  But I do not  know  about\r\n\r\nyou.   I refuse to believe that the only brains here  are\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service  and  that  the  private  sector   is\r\n\r\ncompletely stupid.  It cannot be because half the time in\r\n\r\nParliament, we are always telling the civil service where\r\n\r\nthey  have gone wrong.  So it must be that on this  other\r\n\r\nside  of  the House and in the private sector, there  are\r\n\r\nsome  smart  people.   I do not think  that  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  should sit down, wring its hands and lament  that\r\n\r\nthe  other  side  is,  \"They so smart.\"   You  should  be\r\n\r\nsitting  down and saying to yourself, \"I no stupid.\"   It\r\n\r\nis  over  the question of attitude.  It is a question  of\r\n\r\napproach  and  it  is  a question of  how  you  view  the\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee suggested yesterday that perhaps\r\n\r\nwe should have more of the Government leaders in business\r\n\r\nand  who  knows,  if some of them had gone  into  private\r\n\r\nenterprise, where would we be now, he asked.  Perhaps, if\r\n\r\nSM  had become a top lawyer, where would we be now?  I am\r\n\r\nnot  sure about the others, but I can tell you, we  would\r\n\r\nnot be a sovereign independent state and we would not  be\r\n\r\ndiscussing  PSA  Corporation because it would  be  called\r\n\r\nTanjong Pelepas!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think what we really need is talent across the\r\n\r\nboard  - in Government, in GLCs, in private sector, SMEs,\r\n\r\nwherever it is - but you need talent everywhere.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  question of challenges being located in a certain\r\n\r\nplace.   The private sector should have faith  in  itself\r\n\r\nand  believed in itself, and we do have a private  sector\r\n\r\nthat is good and intelligent, and it should not adopt the\r\n\r\nattitude  that,  \"Oh,  I  can't  compete\",  just  because\r\n\r\nsomebody else has more strength.  Competition is all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  finding  out  how you can  go  ahead  and  compete\r\n\r\nagainst others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion that was put forward was that\r\n\r\nGovernment should help by, through existing GLCs,  taking\r\n\r\na  minority  stake in new firms and should sell  off  its\r\n\r\nshares once the new business is on track.  I examine this\r\n\r\nsuggestion  rather carefully.  You want them  to  put  in\r\n\r\nmoney or to take a minority stake, what you are basically\r\n\r\nsaying  is, we want Government money but you do not  want\r\n\r\nthem  to have any control.  You do not want them to  have\r\n\r\nany  say.   And  you say that they should  sell  off  its\r\n\r\nshares  once  the  new business is on  track.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, give you the money, and once we are profitable, go\r\n\r\naway.   I do not think that is very fair either.   It  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely not the basis on which investors put in  money\r\n\r\nthrough any company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, I think we have to realise that if\r\r\n\r\nwe  want  the  Government  to put  money  in  through  an\r\n\r\nexisting GLC and hold shares in the company, you become a\r\n\r\nGLC  too, because you become a subsidiary.  So,  it  does\r\n\r\nnot quite work that way.  You have to go according to the\r\n\r\nrules  of  how  business is conducted.  The next  comment\r\n\r\nthat  was  made was perhaps you should have more  private\r\n\r\nsector representatives appointed to the GLC boards.  But,\r\n\r\nthen,  on  the  other hand, the argument  was  Government\r\n\r\nshould get out of business.  So I do not understand which\r\n\r\nis it.  You want them in business or you want them out of\r\n\r\nbusiness.   You want them in business, then,  you  should\r\n\r\nallow them to run the companies the way they want to.  If\r\n\r\nyou  are  saying that you should be appointed to the  GLC\r\n\r\nboard, that means you want the GLCs around.  What you are\r\n\r\nreally saying then is you want the GLCs, you want  to  be\r\n\r\non  their  boards,  and you want  part  of  the  old  boy\r\n\r\nconnection  or  network.  That is really  what  is  being\r\n\r\nsaid.   Again, I have a certain problem with the  logical\r\n\r\nconsistency of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, it was suggested that they were inefficient.\r\n\r\nMr  Inderjit Singh said that our GLCs are late  in  going\r\n\r\nglobal  and  the consequences of it can be  seen  in  the\r\n\r\nfailure to compete successfully and in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing   taken   for  a  ride  in  certain  high   profile\r\n\r\nacquisition  transactions.  On the other  hand,  we  have\r\n\r\nalso  heard that all the top talent is going to the GLCs.\r\n\r\nSo  all  the  top talent is working hard to produce  this\r\n\r\ninefficient result, in which case I do not understand why\r\n\r\ndo we want them in the first place.  It cannot be right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you are going and competing, you have to\r\n\r\nmake  a  distinction  between the local  market  and  the\r\n\r\nforeign  market.   When you are competing  in  a  foreign\r\n\r\nmarket,  it  is  not a question anymore of  us  competing\r\n\r\nagainst the GLCs.  It is a question of how all of us  can\r\n\r\ncompete  against  the foreign companies.   If  the  small\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  Singapore  are  not  able  to  compete  by\r\n\r\nthemselves,  you cannot complain about the  GLCs  because\r\n\r\nthey  are  bigger, they have more financial muscles,  and\r\n\r\nthey are more likely to be able to compete globally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion made was that they should form\r\n\r\nclusters  and bring local businesses along,  which  again\r\n\r\nmeans  you  want the GLCs but you want them to bring  you\r\n\r\nalong.  And that means that there is a certain amount  of\r\n\r\ngood that they can bring to the economy.  You see, at the\r\n\r\nend of the day, the local market is too small.  The local\r\n\r\nmarket  is  too small for both the GLCs and  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  to  be fighting over the limited market  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  here.  It is not a question of GLCs versus  private\r\n\r\nsector.  It is about Singapore Inc versus the rest of the\r\n\r\nworld,  and it is something that we have to do  together.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  role for the GLCs simply because  of  their\r\n\r\nconnections,  because  of their  financial  muscles,  but\r\n\r\nthere is also a role for the private sector and the SMEs.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a question of how each one can find its place  in\r\n\r\nthe  international market and make our  mark  regionally,\r\n\r\nbecause the local market is just too small.  This is  not\r\n\r\nto  say,  of course, that I do not have issues  with  the\r\n\r\nEISC  Report.  What I am saying is that, as  far  as  the\r\n\r\nTemasek  Charter and the EISC Report are concerned,  they\r\n\r\ndefine a role for the GLCs and the way business should be\r\n\r\ndone in Singapore, and I heartily endorse that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing that I did notice about the EISC\r\n\r\nReport  which was not highlighted was the issue of  cost.\r\n\r\nA  lot  of Singapore companies have complained that  they\r\n\r\nhave  difficulty in competing because of cost.   Some  of\r\n\r\nthe costs are necessary.  But I think that it is possible\r\n\r\nfor  the Government and Ministries to review their  rules\r\n\r\nand  regulations to see how we can cut down the  cost  of\r\n\r\ndoing business in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two examples. One is the recent PTC regulations for\r\n\r\nprivate bus operators.  When I looked at the news release\r\n\r\nfrom the PTC, they said that SBS and TIBS have a duopoly.\r\n\r\nThey  felt that there should be more competition  in  bus\r\n\r\nservices.  And they said that, in introducing competition\r\n\r\nto   feeder   services,  certain  principles  should   be\r\n\r\nobserved.   First, the new operator and incumbent  should\r\n\r\ncompete   on   equal  footing;   second,  the  regulatory\r\n\r\nframework  would not be as tight, and, third, their  role\r\n\r\nwill  be one guarding against anti-competitive behaviour.\r\n\r\nBut,  of  course,  what  they do in  the  new  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations  is  that  they  stipulate  certain   minimum\r\n\r\nstandards  for the private bus operators, and,  that  is,\r\n\r\nthe  entrances and exits must have a minimum of 1.2 m and\r\n\r\ninstalled  with safety device, and the first step  height\r\n\r\nmust be not more than 36 cm from the ground, whereas  for\r\n\r\nmost  private  buses, the first step is 42  cm  from  the\r\n\r\nground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you make regulations like this, you immediately\r\n\r\nmake them uncompetitive.  Because in order to comply with\r\n\r\nyour  regulations,  they are going to  have  to  buy  new\r\n\r\nbuses,  or adapt the existing ones, which is not  such  a\r\n\r\ngood idea.  As I understand it, the ones that satisfy the\r\n\r\nrules are the continental ones, such as the Volvos, which\r\n\r\ncost  about $250,000, which are about $50,000 or $100,000\r\n\r\nmore than the Japanese models which are currently used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are making a rule and you say that you want\r\n\r\nsomebody  to  be competitive, yet you make  a  rule  that\r\n\r\nimmediately makes them uncompetitive because they have to\r\n\r\nbuy these buses, what do you think will happen to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfares?   They have to pass the cost on to somewhere.   So\r\n\r\nthat is the first example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is the SBF charges. I had asked\r\n\r\nthe  Minister previously what was the reason  for  making\r\n\r\nsuch  charges  mandatory.  The answer  was  that  it  was\r\n\r\nSFCCI's  recommendation as there was an earlier  practice\r\n\r\nof  voluntary  membership and it had not been  effective,\r\n\r\nand compulsory membership would ensure that the SBF had a\r\n\r\nstrong  membership  base and the mandate  of  the  entire\r\n\r\nbusiness community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read the Today paper on 22nd August 2002 which\r\n\r\nsaid that about 8,000 business units had paid, but 16,600\r\n\r\nbusinesses  are delaying payment and a few thousands  are\r\n\r\nappealing  for  their fees to be waived.  That  does  not\r\n\r\nlook  like a mandate to me.  It looks an awful  lot  like\r\n\r\nopposition.  That is because you are just adding cost  on\r\n\r\nto  doing  business.   If you use  the  $500,000  paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital   criterion,  it  is  like  a  blunt  instrument.\r\n\r\nBecause  in  many  companies  which  do  not  do   active\r\n\r\nbusiness, like investment holding companies, they have to\r\n\r\npay.   I  imagine that the GLCs have to pay as well,  but\r\n\r\nthey  do not need the SBF.  So it is cost like that which\r\n\r\nwe  are  layering  on  and  we are  making  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity  bear this cost and, at the same  time,  saying\r\n\r\nthat they have to be more competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government and Ministries to review\r\n\r\ntheir  rules  and regulations to see how  they  can  make\r\n\r\nbusinesses  more competitive, in terms of cost.   And  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of the day, it is not about GLCs versus private\r\n\r\nsector.  It is about how we, Singapore as a whole, can go\r\n\r\nout and get more of the  international pie.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> I want to\r\n\r\nclarify  a point made by Ms Indranee.

And now,  I  am\r\n\r\nworking in a private sector company which was once upon a\r\n\r\ntime  a  GLC,  until  late 1980s, when  Temasek  divested\r\n\r\nNatSteel.   Temasek's stake in NatSteel now is less  than\r\n\r\n10%.   Therefore, I have the benefit of  looking  at  the\r\n\r\nissues  from  many different angles, from the Government,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  GLC's  point of view, and non-GLC's  point  of\r\n\r\nview, as well as the process of the transition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of Government's direct involvement in\r\n\r\nbusiness  has  been a regular topic for  debate  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  The question has been focused around whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  play an active  role  in  owning  and\r\n\r\noperating  businesses, or should it stay out of  business\r\n\r\nand  focus instead on macro economic policies.  Many have\r\n\r\nargued that the Government's presence, through the  GLCs,\r\n\r\nmay  have  an adverse impact on the ability of the  local\r\n\r\nsmall and medium enterprises to develop and mature.   The\r\n\r\nsheer  size of the GLCs meant greater economies of  scale\r\n\r\nand  this  coupled  with the availability  of  Government\r\n\r\nfunding  may  have given them an advantage  in  competing\r\n\r\nwith  the SMEs which have to be run commercially and with\r\n\r\nlimited  resources.  Many even suggested  that  the  GLCs\r\n\r\nhave  scooped up whatever talent that was left after  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  taken the first bite.  After  all,  they\r\n\r\ntake  up  a  big chunk of the capital market in Singapore\r\n\r\nand contribute significantly to our GDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must take a balanced view. We must first\r\n\r\nrecognise that Singapore's economy is somewhat unique  in\r\n\r\nmany aspects.  We do not have a huge domestic market.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  have a large pool of talents.  There  is  little\r\n\r\nroom for error when it comes to economic development  and\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programmes.  In this respect, the  GLCs\r\n\r\nhave  played a pivotal role in spearheading our  economic\r\n\r\nprogress in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the recent economic slowdown has put\r\n\r\nadditional pressure on our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMEs and this has once again rekindled the debate on  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  GLCs.  It is therefore timely for the  EISC  to\r\n\r\nrelease  its findings and recommendations on the role  of\r\n\r\nGLCs.   Its report serves not only to remove some of  the\r\n\r\nscepticism  and reservation people may have on  GLCs  but\r\n\r\nalso  as a guide post for Government's future involvement\r\n\r\nin business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to share my views on three\r\n\r\nspecific  aspects in the report.  Firstly, I support  the\r\n\r\nCommittee's  recommendation that GLCs should  aim  to  be\r\n\r\ninternational  players.  They must play  a  key  role  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping our economy's external wing.  I am not  saying\r\n\r\nthat  private  enterprises cannot become global  players.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there are many examples.  Creative Technology is\r\n\r\njust one of them.  But given the size of GLCs, as well as\r\n\r\ntheir  financial and management resources, they are  well\r\n\r\npositioned to compete internationally and have  a  better\r\n\r\nchance of eventually becoming global players.  We do have\r\n\r\nsome  success stories.  Singapore Airlines, for  example,\r\n\r\nis  not  only a global player but a global leader in  the\r\n\r\nairline  industry.  SingTel and DBS Bank,  on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  are fast becoming regional players and, hopefully,\r\n\r\nin  time  to  come, they too will attain the same  global\r\n\r\nstanding as SIA in their respective business sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for us to develop our external wing\r\n\r\nquickly.   As technology advances, the world is  becoming\r\n\r\nsmaller and more competitive.  Geographical distances and\r\n\r\nnational  boundaries  are no longer  effective  barriers.\r\n\r\nSoon,   we   will   not  be  competing   with   immediate\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries any more but, instead, all  of  us\r\n\r\nwill  be  competing against emerging economies,  such  as\r\n\r\nChina and India.  If we do not develop our external  wing\r\n\r\nquickly,  we  may  miss  the  opportunities  that   these\r\n\r\nfundamental shifts in world economies offer us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing an external wing will not only give us\r\n\r\naccess to global business opportunities but may also help\r\n\r\nus in attracting foreign talents.  For example, I am sure\r\n\r\nthat, with SIA's international\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstanding, it would have no problem attracting the world's\r\n\r\nbest  talents in the airline industry to work  for  them.\r\n\r\nEven  if  they are not physically resident in  Singapore,\r\n\r\ntheir  expertise  will be available  to  us  through  our\r\n\r\nglobal  network.  Instead of directly recruiting  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents,  GLCs  can  consider partnering  global  players\r\n\r\nthrough  mergers  and acquisitions, or through  strategic\r\n\r\npartnership,  and  as  a  result bring  their  management\r\n\r\ntalents within its group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the urgency of developing an external wing for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we must impress upon the GLCs their  role  in\r\n\r\nthis respect and that they must set their sight on global\r\n\r\nbusiness in the long term.  In fact, I would like to urge\r\n\r\neach  GLC  to  go beyond mere mission statements  and  to\r\n\r\nformulate  a  clear  road-map  and  broad  timetable   to\r\n\r\ntransform  itself into global players over the next  5-10\r\n\r\nyears.   Granted that some of these things cannot  happen\r\n\r\novernight  and the timing may not be within our  control,\r\n\r\nit  is  still  important to set our major  milestones  to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate our intent and commitment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I think GLCs must share in the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  helping the local  small  and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises.  I am glad the Committee has recommended the\r\n\r\nencouragement  of  a culture of partnership  among  GLCs,\r\n\r\nMNCs  and  SMEs.  However, I feel that GLCs must  go  one\r\n\r\nstep  further and go beyond mere partnership.  Given  its\r\n\r\ndominant  position in our economy, they should adopt  the\r\n\r\nleadership  role  by  showing the way  for  our  SMEs  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  and transform themselves to remain relevant  and\r\n\r\ncompetitive.   Furthermore, I would  urge  them  to  also\r\n\r\nconsider providing direct assistance to SMEs, whether  be\r\n\r\nit  in  the  form of financial investment,  technological\r\n\r\nknow-how,   management  expertise,  or   otherwise.    In\r\n\r\nparticular, as they venture overseas, SMEs would  need  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  hand holding in unfamiliar environment which  is\r\n\r\noften  hostile.   GLCs  which  have  made  inroads   into\r\n\r\noverseas markets will be in a good position to help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main concerns of the local SMEs is that\r\n\r\nGLCs  tend  to  inadvertently squeeze them out  by  their\r\n\r\nsheer size\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand might.  Such concerns may well be a perception issue.\r\n\r\nIt  will surely help to correct this adversarial approach\r\n\r\nif GLCs can go the extra mile in helping SMEs, especially\r\n\r\nthose  which  have  the potential  of  becoming  a  major\r\n\r\ninternational player one day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs need not look upon this as national\r\n\r\nservice.   The  truth  is that many  of  these  SMEs  are\r\n\r\nsuppliers  or  contractors  of  GLCs.   It  is   in   the\r\n\r\ncommercial  interest  of GLCs to ensure  that  they  have\r\n\r\nstrong and competitive suppliers and contractors that can\r\n\r\nsupport  them  in  their effort to globalise.   They  are\r\n\r\nstrategic  partners  and they are  interdependent.   They\r\n\r\nwill   play  a  crucial  role  in  the  GLCs'  successful\r\n\r\ntransformation into global players.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, while GLCs go through its restructuring and\r\n\r\nrepositioning  process,  they  must  do  so   cautiously.\r\n\r\nSuccess  or failure of a good plan often depends  on  its\r\n\r\nprocess.   While it may be inevitable that some  GLCs  or\r\n\r\ntheir  subsidiaries need to be divested or, in the  worst\r\n\r\ncase, liquidated, the decision must take into account not\r\n\r\nonly  economic  factors, but also several other  factors,\r\n\r\nincluding  its repercussion on the supporting  industries\r\n\r\nthat  may  depend  on it to survive, especially  in  this\r\n\r\ndifficult period.  Some of the restructuring process  may\r\n\r\nalso   entail   retrenchment  leading  to   even   higher\r\n\r\nunemployment  rate.  Therefore, while  the  restructuring\r\n\r\nprocess  is  necessary, the GLCs must manage the  process\r\n\r\ncarefully  to  minimise disruption.  This  is  especially\r\n\r\nsensitive at this time when unemployment is still high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for GLCs to communicate the\r\n\r\nprocess  carefully  to  the stakeholders,  not  just  the\r\n\r\nshareholders, but also the employees, customers  as  well\r\n\r\nas  suppliers, and use their best efforts  to  help  them\r\n\r\nadjust  to  the  changes.  In this way, it will  minimise\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding and ill feelings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the recommendations of the EISC\r\n\r\nhave  been  very  comprehensive  and  I  must  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to congratulate the Minister  of  State,  Mr\r\n\r\nRaymond Lim, for the Report.  Assuming\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  adopts  the  main  recommendations\r\n\r\nperhaps after some refinements, I would like to urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to implement them as soon as possible  and  to\r\n\r\ntake  great care in communicating to the affected parties\r\n\r\nto minimise any adverse effect that may negate our effort\r\n\r\nto restructure our GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you for giving me this opportunity to join in  the\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the key point of our debate is whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment should be involved in business, especially  in\r\n\r\nareas  of  business where the private sector  is  already\r\n\r\ncapable  of  providing those services.  If  that  is  the\r\n\r\nfocus  of our debate, then I am utterly puzzled why  NTUC\r\n\r\ncooperatives were brought into the discussion.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause   NTUC  cooperatives  are  not  Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies.   The  NTUC  cooperatives  are  not  owned  or\r\n\r\nmanaged by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, this erroneous perception may have arisen\r\n\r\nfrom  the  fact  that some NTUC leaders are  MPs  of  the\r\n\r\nruling  Party.  But if we go on this basis, then we  also\r\n\r\nhave  the  ruling Party MPs in this House  who  work  for\r\n\r\nlarge  companies and business groups in various  sectors.\r\n\r\nSurely,  we  will  consider  it  absurd  to  call   their\r\n\r\ncompanies Government-linked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel strongly that parliamentary debate must\r\n\r\nbe  based on correct facts.  Only then can we have proper\r\n\r\nand  useful  debate.  If we know that a particular  view,\r\n\r\neven if it is one that is widely held in the public mind,\r\n\r\nis  an  erroneous one, then we must seek  to  correct  it\r\n\r\nrather   than   to  repeat  it  and   to   add   to   the\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding.  Leadership is not about running  ahead\r\n\r\nof the mob.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that NTUC cooperatives are not GLCs, then I\r\n\r\nwould  suppose that their inclusion for mention  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate  must be because of a perception that they can  be\r\n\r\nbig,  or  that  there are NTUC cooperatives in  different\r\n\r\nareas, or that NTUC\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncooperatives may have unfair means of edging out  smaller\r\n\r\ncompetitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take each argument in turn. If we say that\r\n\r\nthe  problem with NTUC cooperatives is that some of  them\r\n\r\nare big - as if bigness is itself a sin - then we have to\r\n\r\nbroaden  that to include all big players in all  economic\r\n\r\nsectors.   For example, our property sector is  dominated\r\n\r\nby  a small number of big players, TLC and private sector\r\n\r\nalike.  So, what are we going to do to level that playing\r\n\r\nfield for the smaller developers?  But that discussion is\r\n\r\nfor  another time, because the Motion today is not  about\r\n\r\ncurtailing potential excesses by big business but on  the\r\n\r\nrole of GLCs in the Singapore economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, perhaps, the misgiving about NTUC cooperatives\r\n\r\nis  that  they  are  present in  a  number  of  different\r\n\r\nsectors.   We  make  no apology for  this,  because  NTUC\r\n\r\ncooperatives  are set up in areas where  the  common  man\r\n\r\nneeds value-for-money services for everyday living.   And\r\n\r\nwherever  NTUC  cooperatives are present, they  have  the\r\n\r\neffect of moderating prices and improving quality through\r\n\r\nproviding benchmarking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By our sincerity and hard work, we have earned the\r\n\r\ntrust  and  patronage of our members and customers.   Our\r\n\r\ncooperatives compete for the support and business of  our\r\n\r\ncustomers  every business day, against strong competition\r\n\r\nfrom  both  local and foreign players.  Our  members  and\r\n\r\ncustomers know that NTUC and NTUC cooperatives care, that\r\n\r\nwe  do not take them for granted and that we are not some\r\n\r\ncold,  opportunistic, profit-crazy outfit out to  squeeze\r\n\r\nthe  last dollar out of them.  As Mdm Halimah Yacob  said\r\n\r\nyesterday,   for  several  years  now,  we  measure   the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  NTUC cooperatives by  a  set  of  social\r\n\r\nindicators.  And the NTUC publishes this report card each\r\n\r\nyear.    Our  cooperatives  also  publish  their   social\r\n\r\nindicators  in  their annual reports, and table  them  at\r\n\r\ntheir annual general meetings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have seen the excesses of the free market,\r\n\r\nin the wake of globalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  just the Enrons or the barons of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nWe  are seeing banks in free-market economies not wanting\r\n\r\nto provide services to the low income, or those living in\r\n\r\nsmall  villages in developed countries.  We see  tens  of\r\n\r\nmillions  not covered by medical insurance,  when  it  is\r\n\r\nleft  to  the  private sector.  In the drive to  maximise\r\n\r\nshareholder   value,  millions  of  workers   have   been\r\n\r\nretrenched around the world.  This has evoked a response,\r\n\r\na  backlash.  Workers are disenchanted.  Unions and  NGOs\r\n\r\ncampaign against globalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should be our response? I believe we should\r\n\r\nadopt the free market and embrace globalisation.  But  we\r\n\r\nwould   have  to  instill  a  greater  sense  of   social\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  How?  By encouraging the  small  men  to\r\n\r\nfight  back  and compete well.  This they can do  through\r\n\r\ncooperatives.    And  cooperatives   can   act   as   the\r\n\r\ncounterweight against unbridled greed.  This then is  the\r\n\r\nbig  difference  between  our cooperatives  and  private-sector  business.  Private-sector companies  are  profit-driven,   to   return   the  highest   value   to   their\r\n\r\nshareholders.   This is their mission.  Our  cooperatives\r\n\r\nare  driven by the goal of providing the best  value  for\r\n\r\nthe  customer.  That is our mission.  We do well in order\r\n\r\nto do good.  Today, this role is growing in importance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent survey, 74% of Singaporeans surveyed\r\n\r\nwere  very satisfied with the role that NTUC cooperatives\r\n\r\nplay  to  moderate the cost of living  for  them.   These\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  households  will  want  to  know   the\r\n\r\nrationale  behind any proposal that seeks  to  deny  them\r\n\r\nthese  savings and the convenience that they enjoy.   So,\r\n\r\nunless moderating prices and creating value for money for\r\n\r\nthe  common man is something objectionable, then I cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand what the problem is.  In any case, if  we  say\r\n\r\nNTUC  cooperatives are in different sectors, we must also\r\n\r\nnote  that it is not uncommon for business groups to have\r\n\r\nbusinesses in different sectors.  For example, if we look\r\n\r\nat   property  developers  again,  they  may  also   have\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries  that provide for finance, maybe  even  make\r\n\r\ndrinks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final possibility may be that there is a\r\n\r\nperception that NTUC cooperatives\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  special  privileges that guarantee them  choice  of\r\n\r\nlocation  or other perks.  But the fact is that all  NTUC\r\n\r\ncooperatives  have to compete for all the  business  that\r\n\r\nthey  get  and  all the business locations that  they  do\r\n\r\nbusiness in, just like all their competitors.  And,  just\r\n\r\nas they have been successful in some bids, they have also\r\n\r\nlost  other bids.  NTUC FairPrice, for example, lost  the\r\n\r\nbid  for store space at Changi Airport's Terminal 2 to  a\r\n\r\ncompetitor  during a recent re-tender exercise.   It  was\r\n\r\noutbid.   The  lessons  are, firstly,  that  neither  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  -  in this case, the CAAS - nor any  private-sector  property owner can be expected or will  give  any\r\n\r\nspecial   consideration   to  NTUC   cooperatives;   and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  that what replaces a NTUC FairPrice  store  is\r\n\r\nnot  going to be the mom-and-pop shop, but another retail\r\n\r\nchain,  most possibly a foreign-owned one.   So,  let  us\r\n\r\nface facts and not delude ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Members who spoke want to develop local\r\n\r\nenterprise.   I share that same sentiment.   But  I  must\r\n\r\npoint  out  that NTUC cooperatives or - as  some  Members\r\n\r\nhave called them - NLCs, they are local enterprises,  and\r\n\r\nthey are successful local enterprises.  So, why do we not\r\n\r\nsupport  them?  Some Members have bemoaned  the  lack  of\r\n\r\ncapital  for  local  enterprises.   Perhaps,  our   local\r\n\r\nenterprises  can  look  at the  experience  of  the  NTUC\r\n\r\ncooperatives and see how they have raised their  capital.\r\n\r\nLet  me give some examples.  The early cooperatives faced\r\n\r\nmuch   more  difficulties  than  SMEs  today  in  finding\r\n\r\ncapital.  So, union leaders aggregated the funds the hard\r\n\r\nway  - persuading workers, one worker at a time, who have\r\n\r\nvery  low  incomes - to buy shares in these cooperatives.\r\n\r\nThat  was  how NTUC Welcome, the predecessor  of  today's\r\n\r\nNTUC FairPrice, started.  Today, FairPrice is a household\r\n\r\nname  in  Singapore, and perhaps it  is  the  only  local\r\n\r\nsupermarket chain that can withstand and compete  against\r\n\r\nforeign  supermarket retailers.  NTUC Income was  started\r\n\r\nthe  same  way, collecting a few dollars from each  union\r\n\r\nmember.  So, too, NTUC Comfort, which is now divested and\r\n\r\nlisted on the stock exchange as the Comfort Group.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have called on NTUC cooperatives to\r\n\r\nhelp  small businessmen.  And they have.  As Mdm  Halimah\r\n\r\nYacob  explained,  Denticare is indeed a  cooperative  of\r\n\r\ndentists.   They  share  the  revenues.   NTUC   Foodfare\r\n\r\noperates  food courts, but the people who run the  stalls\r\n\r\nare  the  hawkers themselves, who rent the  space.   NTUC\r\n\r\nIncome  uses  its  website to provide a matching  service\r\n\r\nbetween  handymen  and  homeowners,  between  tutors  and\r\n\r\nschool  children.  NTUC FairPrice, NTUC Healthcare,  NTUC\r\n\r\nChildcare cooperatives operate franchise schemes in order\r\n\r\nto share opportunities with the business community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the crux of today's debate is\r\n\r\nabout  fair  competition and how to  better  promote  it.\r\n\r\nThis is important.  This must be our focus, and we should\r\n\r\nkeep our focus.  Listening to some speakers, one may  get\r\n\r\nthe impression that behind the phalanx of accusations lie\r\n\r\nlocal  businesses  scared of public-sector  GLCs  because\r\n\r\nthey  are  big,  angry with competition  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  because they are big, and then suspicious of  one\r\n\r\nanother, not quite wanting to work together, just in case\r\n\r\nthe  other  one might grab the secret formula and  become\r\n\r\nbig.    This will not do us any good.  Singapore - if  we\r\n\r\nlook  at  our natural endowments - is indeed a SME  among\r\n\r\nnations.  And we have no one to complain to.  But we  got\r\n\r\nto where we are today not because the international stage\r\n\r\nis a model of fair play, not because the big boys imposed\r\n\r\na  moratorium  on themselves to give us  a  leg  up,  but\r\n\r\nbecause we as a country took the hard decisions -  and  I\r\n\r\nwould say some rather unconventional ones relative to the\r\n\r\nreceived wisdom of their time - and worked hard to  build\r\n\r\nthe necessary capabilities, capacities and attractiveness\r\n\r\nin order to compete well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the NTUC cooperatives, how did they\r\n\r\nget  to do well?  By following the advice of Dr Goh  Keng\r\n\r\nSwee, ie, employ good professional managers.  There is no\r\n\r\nreason  why  our SMEs cannot follow that same  formula  - pool  resources  and employ professional managers.   That\r\n\r\nwas  very  good advice that local SMEs pooling  resources\r\n\r\ncan note.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that this debate can help focus\r\n\r\nSingaporeans'  attention on what is fundamental,  namely,\r\n\r\non  how to help SMEs strengthen their leadership, vision,\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and resourcefulness, rather than  confuse\r\n\r\nthe  debate with red herring.  Life is not about avoiding\r\n\r\ncompetition  or  defining away the competition.

First  of  all,  I would  like  to  declare  my\r\n\r\ninterest  as a Director of the Energy Market  Company,  a\r\n\r\nsubsidiary of the Energy Market Authority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs have provided much needed jobs and\r\n\r\nsupported  economic  growth during  the  early  years  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's independence.  With a growing private  sector\r\n\r\ntoday,  we  must now address the role of both  these  two\r\n\r\ngroups  of companies.  Much has been said about the  pros\r\n\r\nand cons of GLCs during these two days of debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, allow me to make some\r\n\r\ncomments  on  a few of these points. The Entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nand  Internationalisation Sub-Committee (EISC)  has  made\r\n\r\nsome  recommendations to the Government to  help  promote\r\n\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenterprises.  While this would be good for  Singapore  as\r\n\r\nbusinesses  driven  by the private  sector  will  have  a\r\n\r\nbetter  chance  of  meeting their challenges  in  today's\r\n\r\nrapidly  changing environment, there is  still  room  for\r\n\r\nGLCs and SMEs to co-exist.  I believe together, they will\r\n\r\nbe able to adapt to the different sectors of the economy,\r\n\r\nthus  responding better and faster to market  changes  as\r\n\r\ndemands  from consumers would increasingly be a  constant\r\n\r\nfactor and businesses would have to cope with such short-lived  demands.  The constant factor will not be a factor\r\n\r\nwhich  will be long-lived.  Some examples of short shelf-life   are  electronic  products  such  as   televisions,\r\n\r\ncameras and some household products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivating and strengthening the private sector are\r\n\r\ncritical  to the proposed restructuring efforts unleashed\r\n\r\nby  the Government.  The success of Singapore economy to-date has been based on a pro-investment and export-growth\r\n\r\nmodel.  A high level of savings has allowed such a policy\r\n\r\nto  reap results.  It is based on the belief that  saving\r\n\r\nis  the factor to wealth creation and that savers are the\r\n\r\nimpetus to wealth creation and the nation.  While  it  is\r\n\r\ngood to hold these values, we must however recognise that\r\n\r\ntoday,  challenges are different.  It is the  risk-takers\r\n\r\nand not savers who spawn wealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to actively promote private\r\n\r\nsector  initiatives  in  the  production  of  goods   and\r\n\r\nservices that are competitively healthy and can  be  done\r\n\r\neffectively  by private enterprises.  It should  minimise\r\n\r\nundue  influence of GLCs and big foreign players in  such\r\n\r\nmarkets where the growing local companies will not  stand\r\n\r\na  chance  of  competing, for example,  in  the  building\r\n\r\nconstruction industry.  That way, local companies get  to\r\n\r\ngrow,  be  stable  and  be able to provide  jobs  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.   The  Government may even wish to even  consider\r\n\r\nproviding  seed money and tax incentives to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector to encourage the birth of new businesses that  may\r\n\r\nrequire a long gestation period before profits are  seen,\r\n\r\nas  in life sciences. I urge the Government to also  look\r\n\r\ninto  strategies  to sustain local businesses.   I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest a review of the cost of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoing  business by the private sector and, if  necessary,\r\n\r\nfor all of us to change our mindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many corporations face great difficulties in coping\r\n\r\nwith  hostile business conditions.  One major  factor  is\r\n\r\nthe rigidity of the local wage system.  Wage cost forms a\r\n\r\nmajor  challenge of the total cost of a corporation.   If\r\n\r\nwe are able to allow corporations more leeway in shedding\r\n\r\ncosts,  we  will  end  up with a more  efficient  private\r\n\r\nsector  that  will  be able to react  to  hostile  market\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking beyond, local companies can and must be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to  become multi-national  corporations.   As\r\n\r\nworld  globalisation takes off, small countries  will  be\r\n\r\nable to ride on this wave to overcome the disadvantage of\r\n\r\nits  limited domestic market.  Singapore is no different.\r\n\r\nLocal companies, which by nature are more entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nin  character, may not necessarily follow the traditional\r\n\r\nmulti-national  structure, with a corporate  headquarters\r\n\r\nin  Singapore controlling subsidiaries around the  world.\r\n\r\nThese companies have a network character that allows them\r\n\r\nto  take advantage of the new opportunities presented  by\r\n\r\nthe  inter-linkages of the global economy.  Our corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance   guidelines  may  not  also  necessarily   be\r\n\r\napplicable.   For  example, with a  minimum  of  internal\r\n\r\nbureaucratic  machinery, Acer, which started  out  as  an\r\n\r\nassembler of IBM equipment, quickly moved to selling  its\r\n\r\nown  computers.  It has been able to move quickly to take\r\n\r\nadvantage of opportunities.  This company's understanding\r\n\r\nof local demands and developing markets overseas are good\r\n\r\nbecause  of  their  network with locals  in  the  foreign\r\n\r\nlands.   This example also suggests that it  may  not  be\r\n\r\nadvantageous  to  partner  a larger  GLC  when  venturing\r\n\r\noverseas  as  the company culture to be adopted  may  not\r\n\r\nsuit  the GLCs.  The cluster approach, as recommended  by\r\n\r\nthe  EISC,  whereby GLCs, MNCs and SMEs together  venture\r\n\r\noverseas  may not be a good idea where market  conditions\r\n\r\nare volatile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to efforts to nurture and strengthen\r\n\r\nlocal companies, I feel that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlevelling  the  playing field between the  GLCs  and  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector is as important.  On the one hand,  as  we\r\n\r\nspend  efforts to nurture new local businesses,  we  must\r\n\r\nnot  put  obstacles in its path that  will  lead  to  its\r\n\r\nultimate  demise.   I urge the Government  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sectors space in the local market  to  grow  and\r\n\r\nexcel.   Government policies on land and labour  must  be\r\n\r\ncost-effective and should apply to GLCs as well.   For  a\r\n\r\nstart,  Government  agencies controlling  such  important\r\n\r\nfactors  contributing  to  the  success  or  failure   of\r\n\r\nbusiness  must  be  conscious of  not  pushing  up  costs\r\n\r\nthrough  their  pricing policies.  Instead,  they  should\r\n\r\nseek  only to service the public with a minimum  of  fees\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  cover  their  services.   It  is   equally\r\n\r\nimportant  that GLCs should concentrate on  the  external\r\n\r\nwings  of our economy and not be perceived by the  people\r\n\r\nas  the big fish out to gobble up the market share or  to\r\n\r\ntake over the smaller fishes on their home turf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, please allow me to highlight\r\n\r\nthe success of GLCs extending its external wings to build\r\n\r\nglobal businesses. Keppel FELS, Energy and Infrastructure\r\n\r\nis  a  world  leader in the building of harsh environment\r\n\r\njack-up  rigs.   It  designs,  builds  and  repairs   the\r\n\r\ncomplete   range  of  mobile  offshore  drilling   units,\r\n\r\nfloating production systems and specialised vessels.   In\r\n\r\n1996,  it  has  60%  of the world's  jack-ups  on  order.\r\n\r\nAnother example is SembCorp Logistics which has formed  a\r\n\r\nstrategic  alliance with Kuehne and  Nagel,  one  of  the\r\n\r\nleading global freight forwarding and logistics providers\r\n\r\nwith  offices in 85 countries.  The success of these  two\r\n\r\ncompanies  only serves to highlight the salient advantage\r\n\r\nof  competing in the international arena.  It raises  the\r\n\r\noverall value-added to the industry concerned and acts as\r\n\r\na  catalyst  to  other related trades and services.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should, while seeking to remain in businesses\r\n\r\nthat are strategic to the country, such as the supply  of\r\n\r\nwater,   electricity,   banking,   aviation   and   other\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  services that are  low  in  competition,\r\n\r\ncontinue to improve the performance of the GLC sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their business decisions, including acquisition or\r\n\r\ndivesting businesses,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be based on increasing the shareholder value  and\r\n\r\nreturn  on assets.  But where economies of scale of  non-strategic  businesses can be harvested and  given  to  an\r\n\r\nexternal service provider, GLCs should readily do  so  to\r\n\r\nnurture the local sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we need to enhance the value of our\r\n\r\nprivate sector businesses by keeping them trim, efficient\r\n\r\nand  focused  so that they can maintain their competitive\r\n\r\nedge.   These  measures  are  necessary  antibodies   for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to build up and have an immunity  against  the\r\n\r\never  changing global economic conditions.  GLCs  have  a\r\n\r\nnational  role to play in building a robust  economy  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.   And  since Star Wars was  mentioned,  may  I\r\n\r\nborrow a phrase from it  -  may the force be with you?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, I rise in general\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the Motion.  I think there  are  a  few  key\r\n\r\nelements  of  the  Motion  and  the  debate  which   have\r\n\r\nparticular   resonance  for  me.   First,    Government's\r\n\r\ninvolvement  in  business ought  to  be  circumspect  and\r\n\r\ncarefully calibrated.  This is the recommendation of  the\r\n\r\nEISC,  and  it is really difficult to have any  issue  or\r\n\r\nquarrel  with  that.   It is a sound principle  to  guide\r\n\r\nGovernment's decision-making going forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is supporting the growth of private\r\n\r\nenterprise and entrepreneurship in Singapore.   Again,  I\r\n\r\nthink this would have little problems finding support  in\r\n\r\nthis House or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third element is, of course, greater symbiosis\r\n\r\nbetween  big and small companies, whether they are  GLCs,\r\n\r\nMNCs  and so on, on the one hand, and SMEs on the  other.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  all these principles are important  elements\r\n\r\nin   guiding  the  way  Singapore  remakes  its  economy,\r\n\r\nrestructures  itself,  in order to  face  the  challenges\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the course of the debate, the issues\r\n\r\nthat  struck  me the most was that I thought  there  were\r\n\r\nsome broad guiding principles that we ought to use,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  just in the way we present ideas but in the  way  we\r\n\r\nanalyse them.  Allow me to illustrate that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that we ought to be quite discerning in\r\n\r\nthe way we categorise the various entities we have in our\r\n\r\nenterprise ecosystem.  We have used the term \"GLCs\" as  a\r\n\r\nkind  of  catch-all,  and we have  put  in  there  labour\r\n\r\ncooperatives,  the private companies under  the  care  of\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  listed  companies  under  the  care  of\r\n\r\nGovernment,  etc,  etc.   Many speakers  before  me  have\r\n\r\npointed  out  the special nature of labour  cooperatives.\r\n\r\nIn  general,   the  DNA of all these  companies  is  very\r\n\r\ndifferent.   If  we compare a labour cooperative  with  a\r\n\r\nprivate   or listed company, say, under Temasek  Holdings\r\n\r\n-   and  here I must declare my interest because I am  an\r\n\r\nemployee  of Temasek Holdings  -  we will find  that  the\r\n\r\nmission  and objectives vary.  Therefore, the  strategies\r\n\r\nwill  differ.   And  even  the  stakeholder  groups   are\r\n\r\ndifferent for each of these categories.  So we must guard\r\n\r\nagainst  adopting a very generic broad brush approach  in\r\n\r\ntalking about these companies, because each faces its own\r\n\r\nconstraints and its own set of circumstances in  pursuing\r\n\r\nits ultimate objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to make is that we\r\n\r\nought   to   guard  against  being  too  theological   or\r\n\r\ndoctrinaire  in  our approach to issues  of  business  or\r\n\r\nmanagement.   Markets and analysts are  always  given  to\r\n\r\nfads.  If we just think back to a few years ago, dot-coms\r\n\r\nwere in.  All companies were being told either you \"e\" or\r\n\r\nyou would be eaten.  And now things are very different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we also look at it from the angle of business\r\n\r\ntheory, there have been ebbs and flows.  And in a  sense,\r\n\r\nwe  can argue that unless there are these ebbs and flows,\r\n\r\nmanagement  gurus and business schools  will  be  out  of\r\n\r\nwork.   In  the history of companies, for example,  there\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  discussion  about whether  decision  making\r\n\r\nshould be centralised or decentralised, and the accordion\r\n\r\nhas  moved  in and out quite a few times.  And there  are\r\n\r\nother examples like that in the area of business.  So the\r\n\r\nkey point here is that we ought to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkeep our eye on the ball and take a pragmatic approach in\r\n\r\ndealing with the issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the example of business models. Some of\r\n\r\nour  Members talked with some disdain about the model  of\r\n\r\nconglomerates.  It is true that in the 70s and  80s  when\r\n\r\nbusinesses  in  the  US,  for  example,  were   expanding\r\n\r\nhorizontally and vertically, they were straying  quite  a\r\n\r\nbit,  and becoming large, unwieldy conglomerates.   Then,\r\n\r\nin the 90s, there was a move back to core competence, and\r\n\r\nthere  was  a stress on core competence.  If  I  want  to\r\n\r\nsummarise  the  point, it would be this way.   There  are\r\n\r\nconglomerates  though  that remain extremely  successful.\r\n\r\nGeneral  Electric  is a good example,  one  of  the  most\r\n\r\nadmired  companies  in the US, but it  has  18  different\r\n\r\nbusiness groups.  There are also companies which have got\r\n\r\na  single focus, which also do very well.  Coca Cola is a\r\n\r\ngood example of that.   And we also have good examples of\r\n\r\ncompanies,  both  conglomerates and single  focus,  which\r\n\r\nhave  failed.   Global Crossing is a good  example  of  a\r\n\r\nsingle focus business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point is that we cannot be influenced by\r\n\r\njust  general  trends and fads.  I think  the  underlying\r\n\r\nvalue of a company is determined by many factors  -   its\r\n\r\ncorporate  culture and values, its strategy,  the  people\r\n\r\nand, ultimately, the execution of the business.  There is\r\n\r\nno  such thing as one size fits all.  And in this  House,\r\n\r\nwhen we are discussing these issues, let us bear that  in\r\n\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question that has been debated quite a bit\r\n\r\nin  this  House is: should a company diversify  into  new\r\n\r\nbusinesses?  Particularly, let us talk about  the  listed\r\n\r\ncompanies.   In general, I think we would all agree  that\r\n\r\nwe  want companies to stick to their knitting.  You  know\r\n\r\nthe   business,  you  know  the  customers,  the  various\r\n\r\nchannels, and so your core competence lies in that  area.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  think that is a very important guiding principle.\r\n\r\nBut citing old and hackneyed examples like roast duck,  I\r\n\r\nthink is a decoy.  Because we are highlighting an obvious\r\n\r\noutlier and dodging the core question, which is whether a\r\n\r\ncompany can diversify into new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusinesses successfully, leveraging on skills and  assets\r\n\r\nit  has built up in perhaps other business areas.  And  I\r\n\r\nthink  this is worth thinking about.  I am not suggesting\r\n\r\nthat the company should stray and pepper its resources in\r\n\r\nmany  different  directions.  But  there  are  some  good\r\n\r\nexamples  of companies that have, over time, evolved  and\r\n\r\ndeveloped  some new areas, and we do not have to  go  too\r\n\r\nfar away to find out.  For example, look at CDL.  CDL  is\r\n\r\na listed company in Singapore.  Its primary core business\r\n\r\nis  properties.   But  over time,  it  has  developed  an\r\n\r\nexcellent hotel business under the Millennium & Copthorne\r\n\r\nlabel.   By  all  accounts,  it  is  attributed  to   the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial flair of Mr Kwek Leng Beng.  The question\r\n\r\nto  ask  is:  do we want to encourage that or  discourage\r\n\r\nthat?   Is  that  good  or is that bad?   So,  again,  in\r\n\r\ntalking  about diversifying businesses, we need  to  have\r\n\r\nsome  level of measurement and not put all the  companies\r\n\r\nthat do so in the same basket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point about size has been raised, and I\r\n\r\nwant  to make a few comments on that.  In my view,  there\r\n\r\nare  really two inexorable forces that are compelling the\r\n\r\nissue  of  size   -   globalisation,  which  is  reducing\r\n\r\nbarriers for the flow of goods and services, and  people,\r\n\r\nto  a  large  extent, across countries.   The  second  is\r\n\r\ntechnology.   Both  of  these  are  enablers.   They  are\r\n\r\nenabling   companies  to  access  new   markets,   across\r\n\r\ngeographical barriers and to get into new areas.  But, at\r\n\r\nthe same time, both of these pose immense new challenges,\r\n\r\nbecause  what  it  means now is that  companies  have  to\r\n\r\ninvest  quite  a lot in technology in building  up  their\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  to  deal  with  global  challenges,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore  they need the economies of scale in  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve reasonable returns on their outlay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How big are our companies really? In Japan, an SME\r\n\r\nwould have a turnover that is in billions of not Yens but\r\n\r\nUS  dollars.  That is an SME in Japan.  And comparing our\r\n\r\nGLCs  or  TLCs  to  local SMEs is  a  convenient  way  of\r\n\r\ninvoking  the David and Goliath imagery.  But  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure  it is actually a fair representation of the  facts.\r\n\r\nTalking  about 21% of the market capitalisation  in  SGX,\r\n\r\nyes, but let us look at the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbroader   picture.   If  we  take  SingTel,  its   market\r\n\r\ncapitalisation is US$16 billion.  This is based  on  last\r\n\r\nweek's  numbers.  And if we compare SingTel with Deutsche\r\n\r\nTelecom,  $48.3 billion.  That is more than  three  times\r\n\r\nthe size.  If we compare it with, say, Verizon, which  is\r\n\r\na  relatively more recent player, $88.2 billion.  That is\r\n\r\n5-6  times.  The scale factors are immense, but they  are\r\n\r\nplaying in the same field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about SIA, we are very proud of the\r\n\r\ncompany because of its international success.  But if  we\r\n\r\nwant  to compare SIA, its turnover is about $5.1 billion.\r\n\r\nCompare  that  with, say, Lufthansa or  British  Airways.\r\n\r\nLufthansa is about $11 billion and British Airways  about\r\n\r\n$10  billion.  So the order of magnitude is two times  or\r\n\r\nmore,  and  that  is not even talking about  things  like\r\n\r\nfleet size and how they cover the routes and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of size is a factor and we could say that\r\n\r\nour  Temasek-linked companies or GLCs,  whilst  they  may\r\n\r\nlook  like very big fish in our small pond, once we  look\r\n\r\nat  the  big  ocean, actually, they are, at best,  medium\r\n\r\nsize.  To grow, they have to do one of two things.   They\r\n\r\nhave  to  either grow organically or they  have  to  make\r\n\r\nacquisitions, locally or internationally.  If we look  at\r\n\r\nthe   electronic   manufacturing   services   sector   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, for example, many of our companies  have  been\r\n\r\nacquired  by international players, precisely because  of\r\n\r\nthe scale.  Solectron acquired NatSteel Electronics about\r\n\r\ntwo  years ago.  Celestica acquired JIT about a year ago.\r\n\r\nAll of these are driven by the same factors.  They needed\r\n\r\nscale  in order to be able to leverage on the mass orders\r\n\r\nthey get and keep their overheads down to a bare minimum.\r\n\r\nAll  I  ask is that when we think about these issues,  we\r\n\r\ntalk  about level playing field, but let us give the GLCs\r\n\r\nor  TLCs  a level playing field as well.  Let me give  an\r\n\r\nexample.     The   local   banking   sector   has    seen\r\n\r\nconsolidation.  UOB acquired OUB.  That would be cited as\r\n\r\na   good   example  of  private  sector   market   forces\r\n\r\nconsolidating in response to forces that are changing the\r\n\r\nindustry.  If the same transaction had\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noccurred where DBS had acquired OUB, would that  be  seen\r\n\r\nas  a  positive example of consolidation or a bad example\r\n\r\nof crowding out?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take another example. Mr Inderjit Singh\r\n\r\npointed  out SingTel failed in its attempt to acquire  HK\r\n\r\nTel,  and he said that SingTel moved too slow.  Who moved\r\n\r\nfaster?  PCCW, and where are they today?  So, is that  an\r\n\r\nexample of the winner's curse?  If they had done it, they\r\n\r\nwould  be damned.  If they had not done it, which is  the\r\n\r\ncase,  they are being damned.  Let us give them  a  level\r\n\r\nplaying  field.  Let us treat this fairly.  Subsequently,\r\n\r\nSingTel goes on to buy Optus.  Then the acquisitions  are\r\n\r\ndifferent.  I think we ought to take a fair line on these\r\n\r\nmatters,  and  not  just  take  the  line  that  is  most\r\n\r\nconvenient to our point of view.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Iswaran, can I interrupt for a\r\n\r\nwhile?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection Name   MISCELLANEOUS;Title;Clause;Column 1030;Mr Chew Heng Ching(Mr Deputy Speaker);\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VISIT OF SENATOR HON DATO GHAZI H.

There have been  repeated\r\n\r\ncalls  by several Members that there should be a specific\r\n\r\ntimeframe for the Government to announce how it is  going\r\n\r\nto  release or divest its interests in various companies.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about this.  From whose point\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  view is it desirable for the Government to commit  to\r\n\r\nsuch a specific timeframe?  From the point of view of the\r\n\r\nemployees  of the company, who would then be filled  with\r\n\r\nuncertainty about their future?  From the point  of  view\r\n\r\nof  the customers of these companies, who will then  need\r\n\r\nto  know  what  is going to happen to their  supplier  or\r\n\r\nservice  provider?   Or from the point  of  view  of  its\r\n\r\nshareholders, who will then have to wonder  whether  this\r\n\r\ncompany  they  have shares in is in play, and  what  they\r\n\r\nwould do about it?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of divestment is who to divest to.\r\n\r\nThere  were some comments that maybe we should divest  it\r\n\r\nto private equity houses or large pension funds.  I think\r\n\r\nthere may be some merits in that, but certainly not as  a\r\n\r\nway to argue a case that this is superior necessarily  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  shareholding.  I think  that  remains  to  be\r\n\r\nproven.   Yesterday, Minister of State, Mr  Raymond  Lim,\r\n\r\nmade  an  eloquent point on this, and I do  not  wish  to\r\n\r\nrepeat that, other than to make the point that it is  not\r\n\r\nan  axiom that when you privatise entirely a company, its\r\n\r\nperformance necessarily improves unambiguously.   If  you\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  history of privatisation,  in  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncase,   privatisation  was  not  the  result  of   under-performing  state-owned enterprises which were  put  into\r\n\r\nthe  private domain, in order to subject them to  greater\r\n\r\ndisciplines and, therefore, higher performance.   If  you\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  comparison with, say, UK,  a  lot  of  the\r\n\r\nprivatisation was because the state-run enterprises  were\r\n\r\nnot performing.  So we need to keep that in balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who else can we divest to? Strategic partners? And\r\n\r\nI  think that is a good idea, but it would take time, and\r\n\r\nit  needs to be calibrated because you need to choose and\r\n\r\nwork out the issues, before it is done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, management. I thought this deserves\r\n\r\nparticular comment because this issue of MBOs was  raised\r\n\r\nby several Members.  I thought it was interesting because\r\n\r\nit  came from two points of view.  Some Members, like  Mr\r\n\r\nSin  Boon  Ann, said that MBO is perhaps not a very  good\r\n\r\nidea, and he cited the fact that MBOs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmean  that  management,  which  has  got  an  information\r\n\r\nadvantage, would be able to prevail and take advantage of\r\n\r\nthe  situation.   In  other words, there  is  information\r\n\r\nasymmetry   which   works   to   the   disadvantage    of\r\n\r\nshareholders.  The question to ask: is this not  true  of\r\n\r\nall MBOs?  So, do we then say that all MBOs as a class of\r\n\r\ntransactions are a bad thing?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group of our Members here have pointed out\r\n\r\nthat the MBOs should be encouraged because it is a way to\r\n\r\nentrust some of these assets to local management in order\r\n\r\nto  kick-start the local entrepreneurship drive.  Is that\r\n\r\nreally the basis on which we want to consider MBOs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right approach really ought to be that an MBO is\r\n\r\none  way  of divesting, just as there are numerous  other\r\n\r\nways.   And  what we ought to be looking at,  if  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to debate such issues in this House, is how we  can\r\n\r\nrealise  the best value for the shareholders and  act  in\r\n\r\nthe  best  interest of the company.  I think that  really\r\n\r\nought to be the governing principle for these issues  and\r\n\r\nas  a  result,  there would be a rigorous  evaluation  of\r\n\r\nalternatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all these questions, I think the key point\r\n\r\nis  ultimately,  who should be the judge of  a  company's\r\n\r\nbusiness strategy, its approach to divestment or  any  of\r\n\r\nthe   other  commercial  decisions.   Should  it  be  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?   Should it be the employees?  Should  it  be\r\n\r\nthis  House?  I would submit that whilst all these groups\r\n\r\nhave   got   an  element  of  interest  as  stakeholders,\r\n\r\nultimately  the  only real point of  decision,  the  only\r\n\r\ncourt  of  opinion, for listed companies is the community\r\n\r\nof  shareholders.  Why?  Because they have  skin  in  the\r\n\r\ngame,  and  they are the ones who will make the  decision\r\n\r\nwhether to put money in, take it out, and so on.   So  we\r\n\r\nhave  to be mindful of that.  And I think Government,  no\r\n\r\nmatter  how  large or small shareholder  it  is,  in  any\r\n\r\nenterprise,  cannot ride roughshod over the  interest  of\r\n\r\nother shareholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a final point, I just want to say that the debate\r\n\r\nhas  been perhaps cast as a zero sum if not negative  sum\r\n\r\ngame.  In other words, if the GLCs grow, the SMEs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  deprived.  And if we cut down on the GLCs, the  SMEs\r\n\r\nwill grow.  I think this is a little bit different to the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  the  Motion which, when I first  read  it,  I\r\n\r\nthought  it was very conciliatory and positive.  But  the\r\n\r\ndebate  itself has had a slightly different tone,  in  my\r\n\r\nview.  What we ultimately want is an enterprise ecosystem\r\n\r\nthat affords the space and opportunity for all species of\r\n\r\ncompanies.   If you take a rain forest, for example,  you\r\n\r\nwant  the giants who will reach for the sky and they will\r\n\r\ncompete  with  the  other giants.   We  also  want  other\r\n\r\ncompanies  who will look at the slivers of  sunlight  and\r\n\r\nother possible advantages in order to carve themselves  a\r\n\r\nniche  and grow.  And then you will have others who  will\r\n\r\nbe  on  the forest bed, who will find their own  area  of\r\n\r\noperation  and flourish.  And I think if this debate  can\r\n\r\nset  that  mindset for us, so that we have a new  way  of\r\n\r\nthinking  of  a relationship between all the elements  of\r\n\r\nour  enterprise  ecosystem, then it  would  have  been  a\r\n\r\npositive exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper for today be exempted at this day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom  the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. -  [Mr  Mah\r\n\r\nBow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NEW CHARTER OF GOVERNMENT-LINKED COMPANIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br>3.51 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nall  the  Members who have spoken.  It is now my pleasant\r\n\r\ntask  to  summarise the arguments which  they  have  very\r\n\r\neloquently made.  I do not feel like Darth Vader.   I  am\r\n\r\ntrying to look like Yoda.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of how GLCs came about has been well told\r\n\r\nby  all  the  MPs.   So,  I do not  have  to  repeat  the\r\n\r\nhistorical background.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, today, the value-added of Temasek companies\r\n\r\naccounts  for  some  13%  of  Singapore's  GDP.   If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  not got involved in  business,  most  of\r\n\r\nthese companies would not exist today.  If you allow  for\r\n\r\nthe  fact that the Government itself consumes 9%  of  the\r\n\r\nGDP,  then  the non-GLC private sector, which  means  the\r\n\r\nlocal  companies and the multi-nationals, makes  up  78%,\r\n\r\nwhich is more than three-quarters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our objective is to expand this total pie, of which\r\n\r\nthe   larger  part  is  the  non-GLCs.   And  that  means\r\n\r\nexpanding the productive part of the economy, namely, the\r\n\r\nsum  of both the GLCs and the non-GLCs, while keeping the\r\n\r\nGovernment  share  as  small  as  possible,  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  share  really is  a  consumption.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessary  burden,  but it should  be  kept  small.   The\r\n\r\nquestion is: do GLCs have a contribution to make in  this\r\n\r\nprocess?  Will growing the GLCs be at the expense of  the\r\n\r\nnon-GLCs?   More  importantly, and a different  question,\r\n\r\nwill  growing the GLCs be at the expense of  the  overall\r\n\r\neconomy?   I  think those are the questions  we  have  to\r\n\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone agrees that in our earlier phase of\r\n\r\neconomic development, the GLCs made a contribution.   But\r\n\r\nnow  that the GLCs have grown, now that they exist,  what\r\n\r\nshould we do with them?  Should the Government exit  from\r\n\r\nall the businesses?  If so, how?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we have had a long debate in the EISC,\r\n\r\nchaired by Mr Raymond Lim, and also within the Government\r\n\r\non  the role of the Government as a shareholder in  these\r\n\r\ncompanies,  and what the Government hopes the  GLCs  will\r\n\r\nachieve.   The result, after extensive debate,  has  been\r\n\r\nthe Temasek Charter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Charter sets out Temasek's role - to nurture the\r\n\r\ncompanies  with  the  potential to grow  into  successful\r\n\r\ninternational  businesses.   It  defines  the  types   of\r\n\r\nbusinesses which Temasek will hold and those that Temasek\r\n\r\nwill  exit and divest.  Temasek will have no interest  in\r\n\r\ncompanies that will only serve the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndomestic  market, unless these are strategic  industries,\r\n\r\nfor  example, broadcasting, the electricity grid  or  the\r\n\r\nport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs are important players in the Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.   There  are very few non-GLCs  with  the  size,\r\n\r\norganisational  strength, or the technological  depth  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telecom, SIA, Singapore Technologies  or  PSA.\r\n\r\nThe  closest would be the banks - UOB and OUB, or now UOB\r\n\r\nand OCBC, and the property companies, eg, CDL.  But these\r\n\r\nare  not technology companies.  We can argue whether  had\r\n\r\nthe  Government not built up these companies,  more  non-Government private enterprise would have grown,  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy  would  have  been  more  dynamic  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial.   But  the  Government  decided   on   a\r\n\r\nstrategy,  and it worked.  We are convinced it is  right.\r\n\r\nMaybe you are right and we are wrong, but that is Monday-morning quarterbacking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the GLCs have been created, the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  has a responsibility to make sure  that  they\r\n\r\nare  well run, grow their business, and contribute to the\r\n\r\neconomy.  This may mean tougher competition for the  non-GLCs.  But so long as the competition is fair, it is good\r\n\r\ncompetition, it is good for the economy, it is  good  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy question is whether GLCs should continue\r\n\r\nto  go  into new businesses.  Mr Leong Horn Kee wants  to\r\n\r\ncurb the proliferation of GLCs.  He asked that no new GLC\r\n\r\nbe  formed  without  the explicit  consent  of  MOF.   Mr\r\n\r\nLeong's question has to be addressed at two levels.   For\r\n\r\nthe   listed  companies,  which  Mr  Iswaran   has   just\r\n\r\ndiscussed,  the decision to enter into new businesses  is\r\n\r\nfor the respective board of directors to take.  The board\r\n\r\nhas  to  act  in  the interests of all the  shareholders,\r\n\r\nincluding the minority shareholders.  We cannot forbid  a\r\n\r\nlisted  company  from  doing  certain  activities,   just\r\n\r\nbecause the Government happens to own shares in  it.   It\r\n\r\nis  wrong  both  legally, because the  directors  have  a\r\n\r\nfiduciary  responsibility to all  the  shareholders,  and\r\n\r\nalso  from a policy point of view.  GLCs, especially  the\r\n\r\nlisted GLCs, have to operate commercially.  It does not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmean  that  DBS will go into manufacturing semi-conductor\r\n\r\nchips, or PSA should start an airline business, or even a\r\n\r\nshipping  business.   The decisions  must  make  business\r\n\r\nsense,   and  they  must  fit  the  companies'   business\r\n\r\nstrategy.  But there is no original sin attached to being\r\n\r\nborn a GLC, which taints a GLC from birth and prevents it\r\n\r\nfrom doing  certain types of business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for investments by Temasek itself, we are in a\r\n\r\ndifferent  situation from the early days.  There  is  now\r\n\r\nless  need  and,  I  think, fewer opportunities  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to go into new businesses on its own.  We  are\r\n\r\nnot  likely to start a new airline, or another bank.  But\r\n\r\nwe  cannot completely rule out the possibility  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may need to invest directly in new businesses.\r\n\r\nThese  could be businesses which are exceptionally  risky\r\n\r\nor  which  have  long  gestation periods,  or  where  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  is not willing to go in.   Most  of  the\r\n\r\ntime,  if the private sector is not willing to go  in,  I\r\n\r\nwould say we should conclude that the business fails  the\r\n\r\nmarket test, and should not be launched at all.  But once\r\n\r\nin a while the Government may need to impose our judgment\r\n\r\nand override the verdict of the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One recent example is the Jurong Island project.\r\n\r\nThe Government felt that it makes sense for us to reclaim\r\n\r\nseven islands, fill in the land, sell the land, develop a\r\n\r\npetrochemical  complex,  not  by  building   the   plants\r\n\r\nourselves but by encouraging and persuading MNCs to  come\r\n\r\nand   build  the  plants.   That  is  an  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nbusiness decision, although in that case the decision was\r\n\r\nmade by JTC, and it was done through JTC with the help of\r\n\r\nEDB,  rather than by forming a new Temasek company, which\r\n\r\nwe  could  have done.  Hence, the clause in  the  Temasek\r\n\r\nCharter to allow Temasek, from time to time, to invest in\r\n\r\nnew businesses, in order to nurture new industry clusters\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be other occasions when Temasek will need\r\n\r\nto  go in.  On the one hand, Mr Leong Horn Kee wants  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to stop forming new GLCs;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the other hand, he wants GLCs to help the SMEs by co-investing  in them.  Indeed, as Ms Indranee pointed  out,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a certain tension between these two arguments.\r\n\r\nTemasek  will  indeed  invest in  SMEs,  where  it  makes\r\n\r\nbusiness sense.  But if we did this, please remember  and\r\n\r\naccept that these SMEs, by definition, will become GLCs!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another hot issue which MPs have pressed on is the\r\n\r\ndivestment  of  GLCs.  The Government will  divest  those\r\n\r\nwhich  do not have the potential for international growth\r\n\r\nor  serve no strategic purpose, and these are mostly  the\r\n\r\nsmaller  ones.  Michael Fam's Report in 1987  recommended\r\n\r\ndivesting 41 GLCs over 10 years.  Mr Leong Horn Kee  said\r\n\r\nonly  two-thirds  of these have been divested,  fully  or\r\n\r\npartially.  That is true.  But, at the same time, we also\r\n\r\ndivested  some 30 GLCs which were not listed  in  Michael\r\n\r\nFam's  Report.  So, overall, since the mid-80s,  we  have\r\n\r\ndivested some 60 Temasek companies, either completely  or\r\n\r\npartially,   more   than   what  Michael   Fam's   Report\r\n\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek will continue to consolidate and rationalise\r\n\r\nits  stable of companies.  It will divest those that  are\r\n\r\nno  longer relevant to its mission, but this must  be  at\r\n\r\nthe  right time, at a fair price, in a way which does not\r\n\r\nunsettle  the  market  and which ensures  that  the  GLCs\r\n\r\ncontinue to be properly managed after divestment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mdm Ho Geok Choo urged the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to consider management buy-out  (MBO),  as  a\r\n\r\nmethod  of  divestment.  An MBO is certainly one  of  the\r\n\r\nmethods  which  the Government will consider  and  which,\r\n\r\nindeed,  we  have used on occasions to divest  companies.\r\n\r\nBut,   as   Mr  Sin  Boon  Ann  correctly  pointed   out,\r\n\r\ninformation  is  not symmetrical in an  MBO.   Management\r\n\r\nknows  more  about their company than the  board  or  the\r\n\r\nshareholders.   Indeed, if they did not know  more  about\r\n\r\nthe  company,  something is wrong.   But  this  causes  a\r\n\r\nproblem.   So  it  is not so simple to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nshareholders receive full and fair value for their shares\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  an  MBO.  The purpose of the MBO is not to  sell  the\r\n\r\ncompany   cheap,  but  to  derive  full  value  for   the\r\n\r\nshareholders and act in the best interest of the company.\r\n\r\nBut  we  do not entirely rule out MBOs either,  and  each\r\n\r\ncase will be evaluated on its merits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason for the Government to sell off\r\n\r\nGLCs   below  their  fair  value,  regardless  of  market\r\n\r\nconditions,  by a specific deadline.  Why  should  we  do\r\n\r\nthat?   We  do  not need to raise revenue  through  asset\r\n\r\nsales.  We are not selling off the family silver and  the\r\n\r\nlast  Canaletto  painting that MacMillan said  about  the\r\n\r\nBritish government asset sales.  If we sold off the  GLCs\r\n\r\nin  a  hurry, we will no doubt have a debate in the House\r\n\r\nand  MPs  would rightly criticise us for not safeguarding\r\n\r\nthe   interests   of  Singaporeans,   and   rightly   so.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  would  be unwise to  publish  a  list  of\r\n\r\ncompanies   that  would  be  divested  within   a   fixed\r\n\r\ntimeframe.   The act itself would depress  values,  alarm\r\n\r\ncustomers,   demoralise  employees   and   cause   viable\r\n\r\nbusinesses to run to seed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have argued that, since the GLCs are not\r\n\r\ndoing  well,  we should divest them in order  to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir performance.  We do not agree.  Firstly, most  GLCs\r\n\r\nare performing well.  Over the long term, GLCs have amply\r\n\r\nreturned   the  Government's  initial  investment.    For\r\n\r\nexample, DBS and SIA were transferred to Temasek in 1975.\r\n\r\nAt  that time, DBS was valued at $49 million, SIA at  $91\r\n\r\nmillion.  Today, Temasek's share of DBS' and SIA's market\r\n\r\ncapitalisation is $2.3 billion for DBS and  $8.2  billion\r\n\r\nfor SIA.  So if we take a longer timeframe, the companies\r\n\r\nhave done very well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nature of things, not all GLCs will do well\r\n\r\nall  the  time.   Where  GLCs are  not  doing  well,  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  has to sort out the problems.  If  necessary,\r\n\r\nthe  board  may need to make management changes,  or  the\r\n\r\nshareholders, including Temasek, may need to  make  board\r\n\r\nchanges.   Keeping  businesses in  good  health  requires\r\n\r\ntough decisions and clear mindedness, and Temasek has  to\r\n\r\nhave that, and do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I agree with Mdm Ho Geok Choo that most\r\n\r\nfund managers do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake  an  active role in building up the companies  which\r\n\r\nthey  hold  shares in.  They buy the shares as  portfolio\r\n\r\ninvestments.   They  sell the shares when  they  see  the\r\n\r\ncompany  doing badly, or even when the shares are  merely\r\n\r\nunder performing.  And if the company is doing well, they\r\n\r\nmay also sell the shares to make a good profit.  They are\r\n\r\ntrading, they are not long-term shareholders.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nselling   GLCs   off  to  some  fund  manager,   or   new\r\n\r\nshareholder,  will not magically solve the problem.   The\r\n\r\nway  to  upgrade a business is to assemble an experienced\r\n\r\nboard, build a strong and cohesive management team and do\r\n\r\nthe  hard  work of improving systems, changing management\r\n\r\ncultures,   developing  new  capabilities,  opening   new\r\n\r\nmarkets.    Having  the  Singapore  Government   as   the\r\n\r\nshareholder  does  not stop companies  from  doing  this,\r\n\r\nprovided  the  Government  takes  a  rigorous  commercial\r\n\r\napproach, and entrusts the task to a capable team.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have argued that the Government should simply\r\n\r\ndivest  all its GLCs regardless, because as a  matter  of\r\n\r\nprinciple,  the Government should not own companies.   We\r\n\r\ndo  not  agree.  As Mr Raymond Lim highlighted yesterday,\r\n\r\ndespite the recommendation of the World Bank and the  IMF\r\n\r\nto  privatise rapidly, the benefits of privatisation  are\r\n\r\nnot a given, especially if it is not done under the right\r\n\r\nconditions.  For many of the GLCs, the Government is  the\r\n\r\nmajor shareholder.  If we are to let the companies go, as\r\n\r\nProf.  Koo  Tsai  Kee  asked,  to  whom?   Which  private\r\n\r\ncompanies  or individuals are in a position to take  over\r\n\r\nSingTel,  SIA  or  PSA?  Not just financially,  which  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  enough, but in terms of management  oversight.\r\n\r\nCan  we really just distribute the shares to Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand expect the companies to naturally prosper?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the success stories of companies around\r\n\r\nthe  world, great companies are built by committed, long-term  shareholders  holding major or significant  stakes.\r\n\r\nAnd  this is especially the experience in Asia.  But even\r\n\r\nin the US, after Enron, it is not so clear that having  a\r\n\r\ndiversified   shareholding  and  no   major   shareholder\r\n\r\neffectively in charge at all is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  formula.   Bill Gates still owns  a  big  share  of\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.   He  makes  sure  it  does  well.   A   major\r\n\r\nshareholder has a substantial amount of his own money  at\r\n\r\nstake.  He will take the trouble to find the right people\r\n\r\nto  run the businesses, set the directions, and make sure\r\n\r\nthe business is run properly.  Without a major and active\r\n\r\nshareholder,   it   is  much  harder   for   many   small\r\n\r\nshareholders  to get together to do this, as  Mr  Raymond\r\n\r\nLim   pointed  out.   Hence,  the  Government   has   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to promote and ensure good  governance  in\r\n\r\nthe GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, there are very few local individuals\r\n\r\nor companies with the resources and the capability to buy\r\n\r\nover  and  drive the performance of the large  GLCs.   In\r\n\r\nHong  Kong, there are tycoons, like Mr Li Ka Shing or  Mr\r\n\r\nRobert  Kuok, who own and run major companies.  In  fact,\r\n\r\namong  the tycoons, they own and run a large part of  the\r\n\r\nHong  Kong economy.  Perhaps, over time, such people  may\r\n\r\nmerge  in Singapore.  But remember, a Singapore in  which\r\n\r\nthe  commanding heights of the economy are controlled  by\r\n\r\npowerful,  private shareholders will be quite a different\r\n\r\neconomy and quite a different society from one where  the\r\n\r\nmajor  companies  are professionally-run  GLCs,  and  the\r\n\r\nownership ultimately comes back to all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate that this does not mean that the\r\n\r\nstatus  quo  is  frozen, and that the Government  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to divest any GLC.  We will restructure the  GLCs,\r\n\r\nwe  will  sell off the pieces which do not fit.  We  will\r\n\r\nconsider mergers and acquisitions which make business and\r\n\r\ncommercial sense.  That is the way to make the most of  a\r\n\r\nvaluable asset and to realise the full value of the  GLCs\r\n\r\nwe have built up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me address the question of crowding out.\r\n\r\nMr  Inderjit  Singh  and  also  Mr  Leong  Horn  Kee  had\r\n\r\ncomplained  that  the GLCs are entering businesses  which\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector is fully capable of doing.   Let  me\r\n\r\nassure them that we have no intention of doing that.  For\r\n\r\nexample, the famous roast duck company, again recited  by\r\n\r\nMr Inderjit Singh, had been acquired incidentally as part\r\n\r\nof a larger acquisition\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  1991,  and  divested in 1994  purely  as  a  business\r\n\r\ndecision.   It is an immortal duck!  The Temasek  Charter\r\n\r\nis oriented towards companies which have the potential to\r\n\r\ngrow internationally, or are strategic to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the EISC, Mr Raymond Lim proposed a 'Yellow\r\n\r\nPages'   rule.   Statutory  boards  should  not  set   up\r\n\r\ncompanies  to do things which can be found in the  Yellow\r\n\r\nPages.  I agree in principle with this.  If you can  look\r\n\r\nit  up in the book, why do you want to start a company to\r\n\r\ngo and compete with the private sector?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, applying the Yellow Pages rule will require\r\n\r\njudgement.   We  must expect times when the  Ministry  or\r\n\r\nstatutory  board  judges the private  sector  not  to  be\r\n\r\nadequate,  but  the private sector disagrees.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nquite  understandably, the more competitive the  GLC  is,\r\n\r\nthe  more unhappy the private sector is going to be.   It\r\n\r\nis in the nature of things.  And if the private sector is\r\n\r\nnot  up to the job, it is most unlikely that any of  them\r\n\r\nwill  stand up and say, \"Sorry, I am not up to it, please\r\n\r\ncarry  on.\"    For example, PSB Corp which runs  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and  certification  for  ISO  9000.   Private\r\n\r\ntraining  service  providers protest at  this.   But  the\r\n\r\nformer  PSB Corp, which is now SPRING Singapore,  started\r\n\r\nthe  industry when there were no private providers.   The\r\n\r\nindustry  did  not  exist then.  PSB created  the  market\r\n\r\nbecause  of the national reason that we wanted to promote\r\n\r\ntraining,  upgrading,  productivity.   And  the   private\r\n\r\nservice  providers  then entered the  market.   Now,  the\r\n\r\nprivate   service  providers  say,  \"PSB   is   competing\r\n\r\nunfairly.\"   But  now  that  there  are  private  service\r\n\r\nproviders, it is no longer necessary for SPRING Singapore\r\n\r\nto  continue  to  do this.  And so SPRING  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nhived  off  the  function to PSB Corp.   PSB  Corp  is  a\r\n\r\ncorporatised   entity   which   will   subsequently    be\r\n\r\nprivatised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give you another example. Hdbay, also\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  the debate, was set up by  a  wholly-owned\r\n\r\nsubsidiary of HDB - CESMA International - as a web portal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  renovation industry in January 2001.   HDB  did\r\n\r\nthis  to help raise the standards of the interior  design\r\n\r\nand renovation industry.  Because we get complaints, such\r\n\r\nas  contractors  making a hole in the ceiling,   damaging\r\n\r\nthe  structural  pillar, so HDB set up Hdbay  to  try  to\r\n\r\nupgrade standards in the industry.  HDB deals with  Hdbay\r\n\r\nat   arms  length,  but  still  the  renovation  industry\r\n\r\nquestions  whether  HDB needed to create  Hdbay  at  all.\r\n\r\nWell,  maybe  the renovation industry is  right.   It  is\r\n\r\narguable.   But far better for us to have civil  servants\r\n\r\nand  officials who have the drive and enterprise to start\r\n\r\nnew activities than for civil servants to sit back and do\r\n\r\nnothing.   Of  course, now Hdbay is up and  running,  HDB\r\n\r\nwill consider divesting its interest in the company.  But\r\n\r\nthat  is  a different matter.  At least, I have a company\r\n\r\nand there is something which we can talk about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee says bliss to a businessman is a\r\n\r\nbusiness  world in Singapore without GLCs, because  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  less  competition and more room for  the  local\r\n\r\nbusinessman  to  build up his business.   Would  that  be\r\n\r\nworse?  If the local companies were not competing against\r\n\r\nGLCs,  they  would  still be competing  against  powerful\r\n\r\nmultinationals,  or  large  local  companies  in  private\r\n\r\nhands,  which is what happens in Hong Kong.   Life  would\r\n\r\nnot be easier.  As Mdm Halimah pointed out yesterday,  in\r\n\r\nmany  privately developed shopping malls, FairPrice  does\r\n\r\nnot get in because the private developers have brought in\r\n\r\ntheir  own  partners, their own private companies,  their\r\n\r\nown  friends, which are in the retail business,  and  not\r\n\r\nSMEs,  nor  FairPrice.  So without GLCs, you would  still\r\n\r\nhave  competition.   And if we did  succeed  in  reducing\r\n\r\ncompetition,  which is what Mr Leong really wishes,  this\r\n\r\nwould  result in a less competitive private  sector,  and\r\n\r\nfewer  choices for consumers.  It is worse for consumers.\r\n\r\nFar better to have keen competition in Singapore to build\r\n\r\nstrong SMEs which are internationally competitive.  And I\r\n\r\nthink  Mr  Leong  acknowledges this  because,  after  his\r\n\r\neloquent argument, finally he says he supports FairPrice.\r\n\r\nWhatever the argument, the conclusion was not wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And related to crowding out is the issue of unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition.  There are different ways in which  you  can\r\n\r\ninterpret  the word \"unfair\".  It could be unfair  market\r\n\r\npractices.   It  could be an insight  track,  an  unlevel\r\n\r\nplaying field.  It could be cheap financing.  It could be\r\n\r\nsize.   Let  me  take them one by one.  On unfair  market\r\n\r\npractices, which means cartels, predatory pricing,  abuse\r\n\r\nof  dominance,  the  Government does not  condone  these,\r\n\r\nwhether by GLCs or by private companies.  MTI intends  to\r\n\r\nenact  a  competition  law and all  companies,  including\r\n\r\nGLCs,  will be subject to this law.  There will  be  some\r\n\r\nsensitive  activities which should be exempted  from  the\r\n\r\nlaw,  as  in  all competition regimes around  the  world.\r\n\r\nEnterprises  which  feel  that  they  are  facing  unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition  can then take the matter to  an  independent\r\n\r\nCompetition  Commission and it will  be  adjudicated  and\r\n\r\nthere will be a redress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether GLCs enjoy an inside track, our policy\r\n\r\nis  clear.  The Government will not tolerate this, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  do  this.   We  expect GLCs to compete  on  a  level\r\n\r\nplaying  field.   Ministries and  statutory  boards  will\r\n\r\nmaintain  an arms-length relationship with the GLCs,  and\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs must operate commercially and efficiently,  and\r\n\r\nnot receive special subsidies or favours.  Of course, the\r\n\r\ncorollary of this is that we must also not expect GLCs to\r\n\r\ndo  \"national service\", whether it is to do a  favour  to\r\n\r\nSMEs, lower prices, or provide non-economic services.  To\r\n\r\nfavour  GLCs at the expense of other companies is  to  do\r\n\r\nharm  to  the economy, and to encourage GLCs to  be  less\r\n\r\ncompetitive  and efficient.  For example, MAS  supervises\r\n\r\nthe banks.  One of the banks is DBS.  But if you ask DBS,\r\n\r\nthey  will  tell you that they do not enjoy  any  special\r\n\r\nprivileges  or forbearance.  They are treated  just  like\r\n\r\nany  other local bank.  In fact, DBS sometimes feel  they\r\n\r\nare  treated  more than just like any other  local  bank.\r\n\r\nBut that is how we have to deal with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Inderjit Singh is mistaken that SMEs will\r\n\r\nsimilarly succeed if only the Government would give  them\r\n\r\nthe same special treatment it extends to GLCs.  The truth\r\n\r\nis  that  GLCs enjoy no protectionist measures  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, companies which have been spun off or set\r\n\r\nup  by  statutory  boards still do  business  with  their\r\n\r\nparent.   For example, Ascendas with JTC. In such  cases,\r\n\r\nthe  perception is harder to dispel, and we have  got  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  special effort to be transparent and above-board\r\n\r\nin  the dealings.  For example, any asset transferred has\r\n\r\nto  be  properly  priced, and if a company  competes  for\r\n\r\nbusiness with the parent, then it should be through  open\r\n\r\nbidding or tender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, we will need to corporatise a Government\r\n\r\ndepartment  or  statutory board with a  moratorium.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  CPG Corp, which used to be called PWD Corp,  or\r\n\r\nJurong    Consultants.    The   moratorium   helps    the\r\n\r\ncorporatised entity make the transition into  a  private-sector player and, in cases where the corporatised entity\r\n\r\nwas  the  sole supplier to the Government, it  gives  the\r\n\r\nMinistries  time to adjust.  I fully agree  with  Members\r\n\r\nthat  moratoriums are not desirable, and they  should  be\r\n\r\navoided wherever possible.  They are messy, circumstances\r\n\r\nchange  and  you  wished you had  not  done  it.   But  a\r\n\r\nmoratorium  is no worse than the department or  statutory\r\n\r\nboard  remaining a Government agency.  To help  make  the\r\n\r\ntransition,  sometimes it cannot be  avoided,  because  a\r\n\r\ncold turkey cut over may be neither practical nor wise to\r\n\r\nensure the retention of expertise and the continuance  of\r\n\r\nservice  to the Government in the transition.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, it is not just the company which may not be  ready\r\n\r\nif  you  cut  over  cold turkey, but the  customers,  the\r\n\r\nclients  or the Government departments may not  be  ready\r\n\r\nbecause,  all  of a sudden, instead of having  a  regular\r\n\r\ncontractor,  architect  or engineer,  they  have  got  to\r\n\r\nprepare   specifications,  call  for  tenders,   evaluate\r\n\r\ntenders,  and  supervise.   That  takes  time  to  learn.\r\n\r\nHence, what we did with PWD Corp.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the corporatisation of PWD in April 1999, CPG\r\n\r\nCorp  has  been awarded only about $250 million worth  of\r\n\r\nnew  Government  projects.   In contrast,  private-sector\r\n\r\nconsultants received 118 Government projects  worth  $1.3\r\n\r\nbillion  during  the  same  period.   Had  PWD  not  been\r\n\r\ncorporatised,   these  118  projects  would   have   been\r\n\r\nundertaken in-house by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment.   So,  by  corporatising,  we  have   created\r\n\r\nbusiness  for  the  private sector.   The  part  kept  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate this transition is a minority - one-quarter or\r\n\r\none-fifth  of  the business.  But because people  do  not\r\n\r\nnotice  this, they say PWD Corp, has a moratorium and  an\r\n\r\nunfair advantage.  The facts speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee says that GLCs enjoy cheap funding\r\n\r\nbecause of their perceived links to the Government.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment does not provide any guarantees to  the  GLCs.\r\n\r\nThe  banks  and  the  markets  have  to  make  their  own\r\n\r\nassessment of the credit worthiness of the companies they\r\n\r\nlend  to,  and  the  bigger and stronger  companies  will\r\n\r\ngenerally enjoy better credit ratings and better spreads.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it is not automatic that GLCs will enjoy  loans\r\n\r\nat  lower  rates.   The  lenders and  analysts  rate  the\r\n\r\ncompanies, and their credit ratings vary from company  to\r\n\r\ncompany and from time to time.  For example, Moody's  put\r\n\r\na  negative  outlook on SingTel in June 2002,  fairly  or\r\n\r\nunfairly.   SingTel  considers it  unfairly,  but  Moodys\r\n\r\nmakes its assessment and it has implications on SingTel's\r\n\r\nborrowing  costs.  I do not know why the  bankers  in  Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  Horn Kee's project in China preferred to  lend  to\r\n\r\nthe  three  GLCs  and not to the one  non-GLC  which  was\r\n\r\nthere.   But  Mr  Leong Horn Kee's explanation  that  the\r\n\r\nbankers  were favouring the GLCs irrationally is not  the\r\n\r\nonly possible one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh claimed that GLCs succeeded\r\n\r\nbecause  of the huge investments the Government had  made\r\n\r\nin  them, and because they made use of their links to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to get ample cheap funding.  This  is  simply\r\n\r\nnot  true.  The GLCs were started with only seed capital.\r\n\r\nThe  rest was internally generated over the years through\r\n\r\nthe GLCs' own efforts.  I gave you the example of SIA and\r\n\r\nDBS  just  now.   Let  me  cite another  example  -  also\r\n\r\nrecently    mentioned   in   despatches    -    Singapore\r\n\r\nTechnologies.   Mr Inderjit Singh mentioned  this  as  an\r\n\r\nexample of a company with \"murky beginnings\" - I think it\r\n\r\nwas his phrase.  Cloak-and-dagger.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> No. Not me.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Not you.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Someone else.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Someone else. He does not know\r\n\r\nthe  history of ST.  ST, in fact, is an excellent example\r\n\r\nof  how  GLCs  have  grown and how we have  pragmatically\r\n\r\nevolved our own solutions.  We are not like the US, where\r\n\r\nthe  defence industries are largely private-sector firms.\r\n\r\nWe  also  did not have economies of scale, especially  at\r\n\r\nthe  beginning.  Yet, we needed to build up  our  defence\r\n\r\nindustries,  for strategic reasons, to support  the  SAF.\r\n\r\nWe  did not do this by throwing money at the problem,  or\r\n\r\nby using our muscles instead of our brains.  I think this\r\n\r\nquote is from Mr Inderjit Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF set up the defence industries as companies\r\n\r\ninstead of as Government arsenals, so that they would  be\r\n\r\nsubject to market discipline and would be able to operate\r\n\r\nefficiently.  The defence industries did not get  a  free\r\n\r\nride.   They  had  to tender for MINDEF projects  against\r\n\r\nforeign   competitors   -   often,   subsidised   foreign\r\n\r\ncompetitors  - and match their prices.  Over  time,  they\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  their  capabilities  and  scale.   They   made\r\n\r\nprofits,  which  they reinvested in the  business.   They\r\n\r\ngrew,   using  internally-generated  funds,   not   cheap\r\n\r\nGovernment  funding.   They diversified  into  non-MINDEF\r\n\r\nbusiness,  most of it abroad.  Today, many  of  them  are\r\n\r\nlisted,    including   ST   Engineering   and   Chartered\r\n\r\nSemiconductor.  Could ST companies and managers have done\r\n\r\nthis,  if  indeed they had not used their brains  or  had\r\n\r\nbeen  bereft  of  entrepreneurship?   Could  the  private\r\n\r\nsector really have stepped forward and filled this  role,\r\n\r\nif  MINDEF  had not set up CIS, ODE, Singapore  Aerospace\r\n\r\nand so many other companies now in the ST Group?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the question of size. In some\r\n\r\nindustries,  the  advantage of size is, unfortunately,  a\r\n\r\nfact of life.  For example, in banking and telecoms, size\r\n\r\nis  critical.  Larger companies have more resources, more\r\n\r\ncapacity for risk and more staying power.  For Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  these industries to be  competitive,  they\r\n\r\nmust build up their size to enjoy the economies of scale,\r\n\r\nbuild  up  the  depth  of management  expertise,  attract\r\n\r\ntalent  and grow the company.  As Mr Iswaran has  pointed\r\n\r\nout  graphically with figures, our big companies are very\r\n\r\nsmall  by international standards.  Small companies  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  much  tougher time competing against  the  large\r\n\r\nplayers.   We  cannot  tilt the playing  field  in  these\r\n\r\nindustries in favour of the small players.  In  fact,  on\r\n\r\nthe  contrary,  sometimes we will need to  encourage  the\r\n\r\nsmall  players, nudge and persuade them to merge  and  to\r\n\r\nbecome bigger and stronger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these industries, unhappiness with GLCs really is\r\n\r\nunhappiness  at having to compete against  a  larger  and\r\n\r\nmore powerful player.  But that is the way the world  and\r\n\r\nthe   industries  are  evolving.   On  an   international\r\n\r\ncomparison,  we  know how small we are.   So,  we  cannot\r\n\r\nsolve  this  problem by shrinking the GLCs  or  divesting\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is not the case in every industry,\r\n\r\nand  SMEs form an important part of our economy.  In many\r\n\r\nbusinesses, the small companies enjoy a nimbleness and an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial drive and flexibility which help them  to\r\n\r\ndevelop new products and markets, and to exploit changing\r\n\r\nconditions  faster than larger companies.   For  example,\r\n\r\nMicrosoft  started from scratch when IBM  was  already  a\r\n\r\ngiant,  and  swiftly overtook IBM.  Dell and Compaq  also\r\n\r\nstarted  from scratch when IBM said the PC is a commodity\r\n\r\nbusiness,  and  they have built themselves  up  into  big\r\n\r\nFortune 500 companies.  So, I agree with Mr Wee Siew  Kim\r\n\r\nthat SMEs can act as \"support firms\" to GLCs in a cluster\r\n\r\napproach  when pursuing overseas ventures.  This  is  why\r\n\r\nTemasek  and  EDB  have  set aside  some  private  equity\r\n\r\nfunding  to  invest in promising local enterprises.   For\r\n\r\nexample, Temasek has a small stake in Osim International,\r\n\r\nand  is  represented on the board.  When you rest in  the\r\n\r\nMembers' Room and sit on the Osim chair, please think  of\r\n\r\nTemasek!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving forward, the issue for us, therefore, is not\r\n\r\nso much managing the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompetition  between the big and small companies  in  our\r\n\r\ndomestic economy but, as Ms Olivia Lum and several others\r\n\r\npoint  out, encouraging them to collaborate in  competing\r\n\r\ninternationally.  That is why the Government set  up  the\r\n\r\nLocal Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP), as well  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole  series  of  assistance packages for  SMEs  offered\r\n\r\nthrough  MTI,  eg, the Local Enterprise Financing  Scheme\r\n\r\n(LEFS),  the  Business  Upgrading through  Inter-Linkages\r\n\r\nDevelopment (BUILD), and so forth.  There are almost more\r\n\r\nschemes than there are SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EISC has recommended that the Government\r\n\r\noursource  more  Government  functions  to  the   private\r\n\r\nsector.   We  agree.   Ministries  and  statutory  boards\r\n\r\nalready outsource certain services to the private sector.\r\n\r\nThese  include  IT  software  development,  systems   and\r\n\r\nfacilities maintenance, provision of medical services  in\r\n\r\nprisons, provision of legal advice in certain specialised\r\n\r\nareas, such as international trade law.  Our intention is\r\n\r\nto  outsource as many functions as possible, provided  it\r\n\r\nmakes  economic  sense to outsource and  the  outsourcing\r\n\r\narrangement is sustainable.  However, remember that  this\r\n\r\ndoes mean handing out cushy Government contracts to SMEs.\r\n\r\nIt  means  fiercer  competition for Government  business,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  make  suppliers  more  efficient,  and  save\r\n\r\ntaxpayers money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public-sector agencies are already allowed to\r\n\r\ncontract start-up companies with no company track record,\r\n\r\nfor IT and technology projects of up to $5 million.  This\r\n\r\nis  to  help  the SMEs have a chance and build  up  their\r\n\r\ntrack  record.   In  addition, we  have  got  procurement\r\n\r\nguidelines  which  allow Ministries to decide,  based  on\r\n\r\ntheir   assessment  of  the  potential  market  and   the\r\n\r\nattendant  risk, to lower the tender evaluation  criteria\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  the financial status of tenderers.   Then,\r\n\r\nSMEs can participate in larger Government tenders.\r\n\r\nWe  will continue to make it easy for SMEs to participate\r\n\r\nin  Government contracts, but we should not give SMEs  an\r\n\r\nexplicit   advantage  over  larger  firms  in  Government\r\n\r\nbusiness,  or handicap large firms in order to  give  the\r\n\r\nSMEs  business.   Some countries do  this,  eg,  Germany,\r\n\r\nJapan, but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe result is inefficiency and higher cost for taxpayers.\r\n\r\nSMEs  have to be competitive to survive and prosper, just\r\n\r\nas  GLCs and MNCs have to be competitive.  Otherwise,  we\r\n\r\nwill  wake up one morning and say, \"Who stole my cheese?\"\r\n\r\nAs  Ms  Olivia  Lum  said, SMEs want  opportunities,  not\r\n\r\nhandouts.    And   there  are  opportunities   and   many\r\n\r\nsuccessful  SMEs.  Examples include Qian Hu,  started  in\r\n\r\n1985  from the conversion of a pig farm into a fish farm,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  now  a  major exporter of ornamental  fish  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  with customers in more than 45  countries,  a\r\n\r\nturnover of $41 million, and net profits of $3.4  million\r\n\r\nlast  year.  That is enterprise.  They gave me two  fish.\r\n\r\nI  gave  them to my children, they took a liking  to  the\r\n\r\nfish  and bought dozens more, some of which probably from\r\n\r\nQian  Hu.   There is Food Empire (Coffee) listed  on  the\r\n\r\nmain  board  of SGX.  It makes and markets more  than  90\r\n\r\ninstant   beverage  products,  frozen  finger  food   and\r\n\r\nconfectionery,  eg,  MacCoffee,  Klassno   and   MacCandy\r\n\r\namongst  others.  And they are in exciting parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld,  not  just  the US, UK, China  or  Australia,  but\r\n\r\naccording  to  their  website, also  in  Russia,  Eastern\r\n\r\nEurope  and  Central  Asia.  They are  not  depending  on\r\n\r\nGovernment hand-outs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Chang Kee, a franchise owned by a Singapore\r\n\r\nfirm,  Ten & Han Trading, has outlets in eight countries,\r\n\r\nincluding Malaysia, India, South Africa and China.   They\r\n\r\nstarted off selling 300 curry puffs per day in 1956.  Now\r\n\r\nthey sell 18,000 per day just in Singapore alone.  It  is\r\n\r\nnow  looking  to  export Singapore-made  curry  puffs  to\r\n\r\ncountries  like the US and Britain.  The problem  is,  if\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs  are  successful, they grow big,  they  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger  SMEs, then you have to look at new SMEs  and  new\r\n\r\nchampions,  new entrepreneurs.  But they are there,  they\r\n\r\nwill come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee suggested that the Government and\r\n\r\nTemasek  publish  an annual report of  GLCs  for  greater\r\n\r\ntransparency and to foster trust of the GLCs.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nclear  why he should distrust GLCs.  GLCs do not  operate\r\n\r\nunder  a  cloak of secrecy.  Most of the major  companies\r\n\r\nwhich are held directly by Temasek are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalready  listed,  so  their annual  reports  are  readily\r\n\r\navailable  and,  in fact, GLCs regularly win  prizes  for\r\n\r\nhaving   the  most  comprehensive  annual  reports.    ST\r\n\r\nEngineering, which holds many of our defence  industries,\r\n\r\nis  listed  and  so  is  subject to  market  demands  for\r\n\r\ntransparency. As for unlisted companies held directly  by\r\n\r\nTemasek,  such as PSA Corp, Singapore Power or MediaCorp,\r\n\r\nwe have plans eventually to privatise them too.  In fact,\r\n\r\nSingapore Power and PSA Corp already publish their annual\r\n\r\nreports.   Accounts  for  the  smaller  statutory   board\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  also  available  from  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nCompanies  and  Businesses.   There  is  no  need  for  a\r\n\r\nconsolidated report by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the public unhappiness has not been over the\r\n\r\nmajor GLCs, like SIA, DBS, but the small ones, mostly the\r\n\r\nstatutory board companies.  We have considered preventing\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards from starting companies  without  MOF's\r\n\r\npermission.   My staff put it up, we have  discussed  it.\r\n\r\nWe  concluded that it was not practical.  They may simply\r\n\r\nprovide  the  service  in-house,  which  is  not  better.\r\n\r\nIdentifying out-of-bound areas a priori is also difficult\r\n\r\nbecause each statutory board's situation is different and\r\n\r\nthe circumstances themselves change with time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government will review and cull the\r\n\r\nlist  of  statutory board companies regularly.   We  will\r\n\r\nparticularly consider the need to separate the  statutory\r\n\r\nboard  companies from their parent, especially where  the\r\n\r\nparent  is  the  regulator,  while  the  statutory  board\r\n\r\ncompanies  are regulatees or are somehow related  to  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  board business, thereby giving the  perception\r\n\r\nthat   the  statutory  board  companies  have  an  unfair\r\n\r\nadvantage, like in the case of HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be happy to know that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance will be issuing a set of guidelines to Ministries\r\n\r\nand  statutory  boards on the factors which  they  should\r\n\r\ntake  into  account when they are thinking of setting  up\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards.  They should only form companies  that\r\n\r\nserve  a  strategic role integral to the mission  of  the\r\n\r\nstatutory board or that do not breach the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Yellow Pages' rule.  Companies should also not be  given\r\n\r\nnames  that  bear relation to the parent or  predecessor,\r\n\r\nthus  creating confusion.  I used to know what  PWD  Corp\r\n\r\nwas.  Now,  I  have  to remember CPG  Corp  and  so  will\r\n\r\nMembers.   But maybe that will be fairer.  But  overseas,\r\n\r\nwhere  the names PWD Corp, HDB or JTC carry weight,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  allowed to carry those brand names.   And  even\r\n\r\nwhen  statutory boards set up companies which meet  these\r\n\r\ncriteria,  they  should do so with an  ultimate  view  to\r\n\r\ndivest them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about talent, an important subject.\r\n\r\nMr  Leong Horn Kee attributed the dearth of entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  to  the  monopoly of  top  talent  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Unfortunately or fortunately, the Government\r\n\r\ndoes   not  monopolise  top  talent.   Every  year,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment awards about 300 scholarships, which  is  less\r\n\r\nthan  one-third  of the top students in the  cohort  with\r\n\r\n4As.   Many  of  these  scholarships  are  intended   for\r\n\r\neconomic  activities, such as those  given  out  by  EDB,\r\n\r\nA*STAR  and  IDA.  They come in, they serve for  a  while\r\n\r\nwith  the  statutory board, they go out to the  industry.\r\n\r\nIf  we exclude them, then we are talking about even fewer\r\n\r\nscholarships,  only  about 200  out  of  1,400-1,500  top\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the scholars who have returned to serve their\r\n\r\nbonds,  only 40% remain in service today.  Amongst  them,\r\n\r\nabout  half are young officers in their first four  years\r\n\r\nof service.  Many of them will end up leaving the service\r\n\r\nbefore  their  bonds are up.  Typically, a scholar  these\r\n\r\ndays  leaves after 3-5 years of service.  Those who  come\r\n\r\nin  expecting to serve till they retire are  a  minority.\r\n\r\nThey  will  serve  their bonds.  They will  fulfil  their\r\n\r\nobligations  but they do not see themselves  serving  one\r\n\r\nlifetime career in the Government.  They want to  go  out\r\n\r\nand  they  do  go out.  So we let them go  and  we  bring\r\n\r\nothers in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is no monopoly of top talent in the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  If the Government stops giving scholarships,\r\n\r\nthe impact on the private sector talent pool will not  be\r\n\r\nenormous because we are talking about 300 people  out  of\r\n\r\n1,500, not for life but for 5-10 years.  In fact, not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiving  scholarships  may  make  things  worse.   Without\r\n\r\nscholarships,  either many of our young  talented  people\r\n\r\ncannot afford to study overseas, or if they pay their own\r\n\r\nway,  they  may decide not to come back at all.  And  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must get its fair share of able people,  both\r\n\r\nin  politics and in the civil service.  Mr Leong Horn Kee\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  Mr Lee Kuan Yew should have  remained  a\r\n\r\nlawyer,  Mr Goh Chok Tong a shipping executive,  Dr  Tony\r\n\r\nTan a banker and I too should not have been in Parliament\r\n\r\nand  then  Singapore  would have a more  vibrant  private\r\n\r\nsector.  We thank him for the compliments but let us ask:\r\n\r\nif   we  had  all  done  this,  who  would  then  be  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?   Would  we  have  a  Singapore  today?    Ms\r\n\r\nIndranee said that perhaps PSA would today be called PTP.\r\n\r\nI would ask:  think, who might be the Prime Minister? So,\r\n\r\nthe \"private sector not stupid\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key issue here is not whom we should favour in a\r\n\r\npublic  and private sector fight for talent, but  how  to\r\n\r\nencourage  a  healthy circulation of talents between  the\r\n\r\npublic  and  private  sectors.  We need  to  develop  our\r\n\r\nyoung,  including through scholarships,  to  provide  the\r\n\r\neducation   and   the  opportunities  to   fulfil   their\r\n\r\npotential. We do not ban Government scholars from leaving\r\n\r\nthe Government service for the private sector if that  is\r\n\r\ntheir inclination.  In fact, we have now introduced a gap-year  programme, so scholars who complete  their  courses\r\n\r\ncan hunt around for a 6-12 month attachment, either to  a\r\n\r\nsuper-national, such as the UN, the World Bank, the  IMF,\r\n\r\nor  to a merchant bank like J P Morgan Investment, Morgan\r\n\r\nStanley  or  to  a multi-national such as Intel,  British\r\n\r\nTelecoms.   He  spends 6-12 months  to  learn  about  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  world and come back and be a better  Government\r\n\r\nofficer.   One day if he goes out, he will have  business\r\n\r\nsense,  honed at a young and impressionable  age  and  he\r\n\r\nwill  be able to make a contribution.  The challenge  for\r\n\r\nthe civil service is to attract private sector talent  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the civil service, and at the same time, to\r\n\r\nadopt  forward-looking policies to manage and  groom  all\r\n\r\nour talents so that a stint\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  public service is a value-adding experience  for\r\n\r\nthe officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various private sector companies which\r\n\r\nalso  offer scholarships or sign-on bonuses at the  point\r\n\r\nof  graduation  to  attract talent.  But  the  companies,\r\n\r\nhaving attracted talent, have to manage and develop them,\r\n\r\ntest  them out, give them opportunities and move them  up\r\n\r\nas  rapidly as they deserve. Unfortunately, this  is  far\r\n\r\nharder to do than just to bring in the talent and when it\r\n\r\nis  not  done, the scholars get discouraged, demoralised,\r\n\r\nleave,  and the organisation stagnates.  Sometimes,  they\r\n\r\nalso say that the Government took all their talent.   But\r\n\r\nit  is  not a simple matter of giving fewer scholarships.\r\n\r\nIt  is a matter of managing the talent, bringing them  in\r\n\r\nand  keeping  the organisation fresh and that  is  a  top\r\n\r\nmanagement or board responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temasek Charter and the Government's attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  divesting  GLCs  are fully  consonant  with  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of the EISC on Government  in  business.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  fully supports in  principle  all  those\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee went beyond the EISC proposals to\r\n\r\nmake 10 recommendations of his own.  I have already dealt\r\n\r\nwith most of them but let me recap briefly:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To curb proliferation of GLCs. I agree that\r\n\r\nthe GLCs' growth should be disciplined but I cannot agree\r\n\r\nnever to start or grow GLCs;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Government to set up a specific timeframe for\r\n\r\ndivestment.  We cannot agree;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Government to outsource any commercial\r\n\r\nrequirements.  I agree in principle;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Review of subsidiaries under the statutory\r\n\r\nboards and Government agencies.  I agree;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) NTUC/SLF to review its stable of companies.\r\n\r\nThis  is for NTUC/SLF to decide.  Mdm Halimah and Mr Heng\r\n\r\nChee How have already explained eloquently\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNTUC's views.  There is nothing much I can add except  to\r\n\r\nmake an appointment to visit Denticare;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Priority to enacting competition law. I agree;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) GLCs to enlist more private sector persons\r\n\r\nin  boards  and management.  GLCs need to seek  the  best\r\n\r\ntalent, whether it is the private or public sector;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) Encourage more MBOs and divestment to\r\n\r\nlocals.    MBO  is  one  method  of  divestment   to   be\r\n\r\nconsidered,  but whether it is the best approach  depends\r\n\r\non  particular circumstances of the GLC and the specifics\r\n\r\nof the MBO proposals;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix) More GLCs and private sector cooperation as\r\n\r\ncluster or consortium.  We agree in principle; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(x) Regular study by the Department of Statistics\r\n\r\n(DOS) on GLCs' share of GDP.  I agree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I ought to thank Dr Wang Kai Yuen for\r\n\r\ngiving  us  a historical perspective on this subject  and\r\n\r\nreminding us that these same issues were debated 20 years\r\n\r\nago  and  probably our successors will still be  debating\r\n\r\nthem 20 years from now. We need to try to rise above  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  Do not assume that the problem for SMEs  will\r\n\r\ngo away if we do not have GLCs.  As Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai\r\n\r\nKee  and Mdm Halimah Yacob pointed out, without them, the\r\n\r\nvacuum would be filled by the large private companies  or\r\n\r\nMNCs  and  the  SMEs  would still  have  to  face  fierce\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EISC recommendations on the Government in\r\n\r\nbusiness  will  help  to  define the  Government's  role,\r\n\r\nfoster    the   growth   of   private   enterprise    and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.   The Temasek Charter  will  guide  the\r\n\r\nTemasek  companies  on what Government,  as  shareholder,\r\n\r\nexpects of them. As for the private sector's concerns  on\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs,  the  Government will  tackle  those  problems\r\n\r\nwhenever they arise.  As I have said before, and I  offer\r\n\r\nit  again, if you know of specific problems, let me know,\r\n\r\ne-mail me, I will look into it, after removing your  name\r\n\r\nfrom the e-mail.  I have done so.  Sometimes, there is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason and it has to be put right; sometimes, there is an\r\n\r\nexplanation  and  that  has  to  be  conveyed.   But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will exit from businesses that are  no  longer\r\n\r\nrelevant although it cannot do this overnight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is not to dump the GLCs altogether or\r\n\r\nto  handicap  the  GLCs and prevent them  from  competing\r\n\r\nfairly  but  robustly against private  companies.   GLCs,\r\n\r\nprivate  companies and SMEs all have  roles  to  play  in\r\n\r\ngrowing  our  economy and developing our  external  wing.\r\n\r\nThey   will  sometimes  compete,  but  they  should  also\r\n\r\ncooperate  with one another.  As Ms Indranee  and  others\r\n\r\nhave said, the issue is Singapore Inc. versus the rest of\r\n\r\nthe  world. Government's overall thrust is thus  to  grow\r\n\r\nthe  private sector as a whole, whether GLCs or non-GLCs.\r\n\r\nAnd  as  Mrs Fang Ai Lian pointed out, the issue is  also\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, because it is the spirit of  enterprise\r\n\r\nthat will help us to adapt and grow as the world changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the economy grows, and as the private sector\r\n\r\nexpands,  the  shape of the Government in  business  will\r\n\r\nchange.  The  key  is  not  whether  the  companies   are\r\n\r\nGovernment-owned,  but  whether  they   are   well   run,\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial and profitable.  We have every  intention\r\n\r\nof  ensuring  that GLCs are as well run,  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nand profitable as private companies.  That is the way  to\r\n\r\nbuild an efficient and vibrant economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this spirit, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe motion.  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Leong, do you want to wrap\r\n\r\nup?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to thank  all  the  24  Members,\r\n\r\nincluding  the 22 PAP MPs and NMPs, MOS Raymond  Lim  and\r\n\r\nDPM Lee Hsien Loong, for speaking on this motion.  I have\r\n\r\nlistened   very   carefully  to   all   their   speeches,\r\n\r\nparticularly by MOS Raymond Lim and DPM Lee Hsien  Loong.\r\n\r\nThey  have all made very good points.  I wonder why  none\r\n\r\nof  the Opposition MPs and the NCMP spoke on this motion.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, they thought that this motion is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot very important enough for them to debate on it. I  do\r\n\r\nnot agree with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank the Minister of State, Mr\r\n\r\nRaymond  Lim for his considered reply.  I am  pleased  to\r\n\r\nhear from him and, as explained by him, there will be  no\r\n\r\n\"Great  GLC Sale\".  As to the response by DPM  Lee  Hsien\r\n\r\nLoong,  I would like to thank him specially for his  very\r\n\r\nthorough  and  robust  reply.   He  has  set  down  clear\r\n\r\npolicies  on  GLCs  and  the  basis  for  Government   in\r\n\r\nbusiness.  He has put across the total picture in a  very\r\n\r\nclear perspective.  I would like to especially thank  him\r\n\r\nfor the clarity of his reply and explanations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just on a few points about the comments that I\r\n\r\nhave  made.   I want to clarify that in the case  of  the\r\n\r\njoint venture with three GLCs and a local company, I  did\r\n\r\nnot  mean  to  say that the bank had made  an  irrational\r\n\r\ndecision.   In  fact, the bank had made a  very  rational\r\n\r\ndecision.  In contrast to the private company, the  three\r\n\r\nGLCs  are  much  larger and stronger and therefore  given\r\n\r\nlower  interest  rate.  As the DPM  has  said,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  size.  For a smaller private  company,  our\r\n\r\ncorporate guarantee was deemed to be of lesser value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point I would like to clarify is that\r\n\r\nthe  annual  report  to be prepared by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  and Temasek Holdings is meant more for the  non-listed  companies,  and is meant as  an  avenue  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take stock, perhaps every year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about Ministers in private practice or\r\n\r\nprofessional business, I did not say that they should  go\r\n\r\ninto  private practice or into professional business.   I\r\n\r\nsaid  that  if they had been, they would have  made  very\r\n\r\ngood  entrepreneurs or good businessmen  -  \"if they  had\r\n\r\nbeen\".   I  agree that we are glad that they did  not  go\r\n\r\ninto private business.  For the sake of Singapore, we are\r\n\r\npleased  to have very good Ministers in charge.   I  just\r\n\r\nwant to make the point that because of being scholars, if\r\n\r\nthey  had  not taken up the scholarship, they  could,  on\r\n\r\ntheir own\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerits,  have become great entrepreneurs.  That  was  the\r\n\r\npoint I was trying to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the 10 recommendations that I made to\r\n\r\nthe  DPM,  I  did not count because he was going  through\r\n\r\nthem  very quickly.  I think I got about 6-7 right.   So,\r\n\r\nit is above the passing mark!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to say that much criticism had been\r\n\r\nlevied  on  the  GLCs.   I  wish therefore  to  put  into\r\n\r\nperspective the values of GLCs.  I agree that  they  have\r\n\r\nseveral  plus  factors.   They have  contributed  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy,   and   given  employment.   They   are   mostly\r\n\r\nefficient,  well run, and they are clean and non-corrupt.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  some  GLCs, like SIA,  have  helped  to  put\r\n\r\nSingapore on the world map.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people actually asked me why am I knocking the\r\n\r\nGLCs.   I would like to explain that I am not complaining\r\n\r\nabout  GLCs per se.   What I am debating is the  fairness\r\n\r\nand  the  benefits  against the evils  of  Government  in\r\n\r\nbusiness.    All  of  us  have  friends,  relatives   and\r\n\r\nconstituents who are working in GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to emphasise the point on the need to reinvent\r\n\r\nfor  the  success of Singapore, a comparison can be  made\r\n\r\nbetween  Korea  and  Japan.  During the  Asian  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis in 1997, Korea was badly affected and nearly  went\r\n\r\nbankrupt.   But  now  they  are bouncing  back  strongly,\r\n\r\nbecause they have changed everything.  They have  changed\r\n\r\ntheir  constitution, changed their President and  changed\r\n\r\nthe  way  their  economy is run.   In  contrast,  Japan's\r\n\r\neconomy  was drifting for over a decade, because  it  was\r\n\r\nunwilling  to make painful but necessary changes  to  its\r\n\r\neconomic structure.  Japan is still languishing today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on this Motion, much has been\r\n\r\nsaid  to  clear  the air and the smoke about  GLCs.   The\r\n\r\nconcerns started about 15 years ago which resulted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  Public  Sector  Divestment  Committee  under  Mr\r\n\r\nMichael  Fam.   Fifteen years later, we are still  having\r\n\r\nthis debate on GLCs.  I do hope that with the EISC Report\r\n\r\nand  the  Temasek Charter, and the explanations given  by\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Prime Minister, there may not be a  need  for\r\n\r\ndebate 15 years later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to conclude by agreeing with the DPM\r\n\r\nthat  going forward, GLCs will coexist side by side  with\r\n\r\nprivate  companies,  each  playing  a  vital  role,  each\r\n\r\nhelping  and supporting the other to grow.  The  ultimate\r\n\r\nobjective   is   to  create  world-class  companies   for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It does not matter really whether they should\r\n\r\nbe  GLCs or privately owned companies.  We should have  a\r\n\r\ngood  mix of both.  Above all, we want to have a  system,\r\n\r\nan  economic and industrial model, which is the best  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We want a model that can take  us  into  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to thank the Speaker and you, Mr and\r\n\r\nMdm Deputy Speakers, for your patience and indulgence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, taking into account the Report of\r\n\r\nthe   Entrepreneurship   and  Internationalisation   Sub-Committee (EISC) of the Economic Review Committee and the\r\n\r\npress  release by Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd on  the  new\r\n\r\ncharter of the Government-linked companies (GLCs) and  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the  concerns of the private  sector  regarding\r\n\r\nGLCs,    urges   the   Government   to   implement    the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the EISC which define  the  new  roles\r\n\r\nand  positioning of the Government and GLCs  in  business\r\n\r\nand,   in   so  doing,  support  the  growth  of  private\r\n\r\nenterprise and entrepreneurship in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be\r\n\r\nfixed.\"  - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Ten minutes</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to Five o'clock pm to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
