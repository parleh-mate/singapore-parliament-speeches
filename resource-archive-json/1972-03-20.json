Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Yeo Choo Kok, Ho See Beng and Seah Mui Kok.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last Budget session, I spoke on staff\r\n\r\nshortage  in  the Telecommunications Department  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Communications. Let me quote what I\r\n\r\nsaid on the 19th March last year [Hansard, Vol. 30,\r\n\r\nNo. 13, col. 889]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... we have a very serious shortage of staff in the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department. The employees in the\r\n\r\noperational side of the department work day in  and\r\n\r\nday  out  without obtaining any time off  for  rest\r\n\r\ndays and public holidays.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, the International Telegraph\r\n\r\nSection of the Telecommunications Department  alone\r\n\r\nowed  the staff for the period June 1969 to January\r\n\r\n1971  a  total of 30,000 hours for working on  rest\r\n\r\ndays  and public holidays. The Department owed  the\r\n\r\nmessengers 11,500 hours, clerical assistants  5,600\r\n\r\nhours,  and  counter  clerks 1,500  hours.  I  also\r\n\r\nmentioned then, Sir, the fact that messengers  were\r\n\r\nput  on  duty  without a single  day  of  rest  for\r\n\r\nseveral weeks at a stretch. They worked for half  a\r\n\r\nyear  without any rest days or public  holidays.  I\r\n\r\nalso  mentioned the fact that there should  not  be\r\n\r\nany   problem   at   all  in  recruiting   clerical\r\n\r\nassistants,  counter clerks and messengers  because\r\n\r\nthey are not highly skilled persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now quote to you, Sir, what the Minister\r\n\r\ntold  this  House then, and I quote from  the  same\r\n\r\nHansard, col. 892:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am very pleased to say that for the first time\r\n\r\nthe  department  is well ahead on recruitment.  The\r\n\r\nPublic  Service  Commission has just  completed  an\r\n\r\nexercise to recruit over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>250&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecommunications  clerical  assistants  and\r\n\r\ntechnicians. This will wipe out the present vacancy\r\n\r\nposition  as  well as fill the 159  new  posts  now\r\n\r\ncoming  up  for  approval  before  the  House.  The\r\n\r\ndepartment should be able to have a full complement\r\n\r\nof staff by May this year.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That was the reply last year. And he continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A crash training programme is being arranged\r\n\r\nwhich  will enable the new staff to be trained  and\r\n\r\nput into operating position some time in August. It\r\n\r\nis  anticipated that the long overdue time off  can\r\n\r\nbe granted thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely that 24 vacancies in the vote for\r\n\r\ntelegraph  messengers will be filled  by  June,  by\r\n\r\nwhich period time off for messengers can be granted\r\n\r\nthereafter.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will relate also what actually is the\r\n\r\nposition  today.  It  is strange,  but  true,  that\r\n\r\nalthough the Minister for Communications assured me\r\n\r\non   19th  March  last  year  that  the  loyal  and\r\n\r\ndedicated    staff    of   the   Telecommunications\r\n\r\nDepartment  would  not  again  be  faced  with   an\r\n\r\nenormous  accumulation of time off, for this  year,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  from March 1971 to February 1972, the figure\r\n\r\nstands  at 45,000 hours owing to the staff  in  the\r\n\r\ndepartment.  Sir,  the workers  in  the  department\r\n\r\ncannot  be  treated as cogs in the  wheels  of  the\r\n\r\ndepartment. They should be given justice. It  would\r\n\r\nseem odd indeed that such a situation exists in the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications   Department   since,   as   the\r\n\r\nMinister  intimated last year, the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission  had  just  completed  an  exercise   to\r\n\r\nrecruit  over 250 Telecoms clerical assistants  and\r\n\r\ntechnicians and that the 24 vacancies for telegraph\r\n\r\nmessengers would be filled by June. Sir,  what  has\r\n\r\nactually gone wrong? Was the recruitment done? Were\r\n\r\nthe  people recruited at all? My firm suspicion  is\r\n\r\nit has broken down. Let us hope not. The department\r\n\r\nis   expanding  with  greater  demands  for  higher\r\n\r\ntechnological Telecommunications. Rapid advancement\r\n\r\nhas  been  achieved  with the installation  of  the\r\n\r\nsatellite  earth station and the expansion  of  the\r\n\r\ntelex  service.  But to keep pace with  this  rapid\r\n\r\ndevelopment in the department, staffing should also\r\n\r\nbe  increased  commensurate with  the  development.\r\n\r\nSir, progress, cannot be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachieved  without  adequate, contented,  and  well-rested  staff.  May  I suggest  that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nradically revises the present situation existing in\r\n\r\nthe  Telecommunications Department to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  defects are remedied without prejudice to  any\r\n\r\nbetter   provision  which  may  exist  or  may   be\r\n\r\nnegotiated by the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that the Telecommunications Department is\r\n\r\nto  be  made  the  Telecommunication  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  from  1st  April this  year,  will  this\r\n\r\nimprove  the  situation at all? I have  my  doubts.\r\n\r\nAnother   statutory  board,  the  Public  Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard,   has  similar  problems  of  overtime   and\r\n\r\nstaffing.  Do I have to come back again  next  year\r\n\r\nand make the same plea on behalf of the workers  of\r\n\r\nthe Telecommunication Authority of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Will you be here next year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I will be here next year!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it does appear to be a\r\n\r\nrepeat  performance on the part of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah in respect of the Telecommunications\r\n\r\nDepartment. He has asked whether anything has  gone\r\n\r\nwrong  with the Telecommunications Department.  The\r\n\r\nanswer is: nothing has gone wrong. It is only  that\r\n\r\nthe  growth  of traffic has been more than  normal.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the very rapid expansion  and  demands\r\n\r\nfrom  the commercial public, the Telecommunications\r\n\r\nDepartment could only meet this abnormal demand  by\r\n\r\ninvolving the staff in overtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has quoted passages from Hansard in respect of\r\n\r\nthe  previous  year's Budget. Vacancies  then  were\r\n\r\nbeing  filled.  The Public Service  Commission  did\r\n\r\ninterview  the  candidates  concerned,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nnormal  for  applicants  to be  interviewed  around\r\n\r\nFebruary-March when the results of the Secondary IV\r\n\r\nexaminations  are  known. I think  that  is  normal\r\n\r\nprocedure. So once again in February-March\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis year there would be another recruitment\r\n\r\nof  staff  to  fill any vacancies. But  may  I,  in\r\n\r\nreply, provide some figures too, for the benefit of\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member?  At the beginning  of  the  last\r\n\r\nfinancial  year,  there  were  166  vacancies   for\r\n\r\noperational staff and 57 vacancies for technicians,\r\n\r\nwhich  represent a vacancy percentage of  about  20\r\n\r\nper  cent and 16 per cent respectively. It is  very\r\n\r\nhigh,  and  I think it is unfair to the workers  on\r\n\r\nthe  establishment having to work overtime to  fill\r\n\r\nthis  gap. 174 operational staff and 51 technicians\r\n\r\nwere  recruited  during the year. That  would  have\r\n\r\nvirtually    filled   all   the   vacancies,    but\r\n\r\nunfortunately  with  recruitment  there  were  also\r\n\r\nresignations  or  retirements. There  was  a  staff\r\n\r\nreduction  of  this  nature  by  as  many   as   67\r\n\r\noperational  staff  and  25 technicians  (the  word\r\n\r\n\"wastage\"  was  being used),  leaving  us  with  59\r\n\r\nvacancies  - 4 operational staff and 31 technicians\r\n\r\n-  waiting to be filled. This represents a  reduced\r\n\r\nrate  of vacancy percentage at only seven per  cent\r\n\r\nand  nine  per  cent respectively. I  think  if  we\r\n\r\ncompare  with the previous `year's rate of  vacancy\r\n\r\npercentage of 20 per cent and 16 per cent,  we  can\r\n\r\nsay  that  there  has  been an improvement  in  the\r\n\r\nsituation. However, selection of candidates to fill\r\n\r\nthese  remaining vacancies has just been completed,\r\n\r\nand  it is envisaged that most, if not all, of  the\r\n\r\nvacancies  for  operational staff and  technicians,\r\n\r\nwill be filled shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has partly answered his own query when\r\n\r\nhe    touched   on   the   establishment   of   the\r\n\r\nTelecommunication Authority of Singapore in 10 days\r\n\r\ntime.  The Telecommunications Department  which  is\r\n\r\nnow part of a Government Ministry will be converted\r\n\r\ninto  a  statutory organisation,  and  one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons why we are converting it is to give it more\r\n\r\nflexibility  in the recruitment and  employment  of\r\n\r\nstaff.  It  may not be necessary, for  example,  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  staff annually. The new Authority will  be\r\n\r\nin  a position to recruit staff as and when it, is\r\n\r\nnecessary  and  to  decide on  the  salary  scales,\r\n\r\nbearing in mind the Government salary structure and\r\n\r\nterms and conditions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof service. As a statutory organisation, it will\r\n\r\ncertainly be able to move much more quickly in\r\n\r\ndealing with overtime problems like we have now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to overtime, may I say that the\r\n\r\nposition  is  not as bad as that  stated  by  the\r\n\r\nMember,  who  quoted the figure of  thousands  of\r\n\r\nhours of overtime due. Time-off, which was earned\r\n\r\nand  accumulated up to 31st December,  1970,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  converted  to  leave, and  such  leave  was\r\n\r\ncommuted  to  overtime pay  at  normal  rates  of\r\n\r\nsalary. So money has been paid for overtime which\r\n\r\nhas been accumulated prior to that date. But from\r\n\r\n1971 onwards, the accumulation began to build  up\r\n\r\nonce  again and this will have to be adjusted  at\r\n\r\nsome  future  date. However,  I  can  assure  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Telok Blangah that it  will  not  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  for him to repeat a third  performance\r\n\r\nat the next Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yeo Choo Kok.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> I am not speaking.\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> I am not speaking,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Seah Mui Kok is not here.

Govindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead, I would like to touch\r\n\r\non two matters relating to the Paya Lebar\r\n\r\nAirport. I hope the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  pay  special attention to them  because  of\r\n\r\ncertain complaints I have received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first complaint is that the officers of the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department at the Paya Lebar  Airport\r\n\r\nare not very efficient. The number of porters  at\r\n\r\nthe  Airport is also too small. There is  a  need\r\n\r\nfor more porters. Being an international airport,\r\n\r\nthe  traffic has been increasing every  year.  At\r\n\r\npresent  the number of passengers is  nearly  two\r\n\r\nmillion  a  year. This shows that more  and  more\r\n\r\ntravellers are coming from abroad. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nmust  extend the highest standard of  service  to\r\n\r\nthem  in order to impress them, so that they will\r\n\r\nspread our good reputation abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Government has made\r\n\r\nprovision  for  a  few million  dollars  for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Paya Lebar Airport, which includes\r\n\r\nthe extension of the runway and the building of a\r\n\r\nnew  hangar to accommodate the Boeing  747.  This\r\n\r\ntype   of   passenger  air  liner  requires   the\r\n\r\nredevelopment of the Passenger Terminal Building.\r\n\r\nIn  view  of  all  this, we hope that  our  civil\r\n\r\naviation   services   will  reach   international\r\n\r\nstandards,  which, I think, is  the  aim  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  should  maintain  a   reasonable\r\n\r\nstandard of service. Therefore, all the staff  at\r\n\r\nthe   Airport,   including  the  staff   of   the\r\n\r\nImmigration   Department,   should   provide   an\r\n\r\nefficient  service. They should be  courteous  to\r\n\r\nthe  tourists, so that those coming  from  abroad\r\n\r\nwill have a better impression of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I regret to say that recently I\r\n\r\nhave received some complaints from members of the\r\n\r\npublic  to the effect that the staff at the  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar Airport were rather slow in rendering their\r\n\r\nservices.  For instance, air travellers  have  to\r\n\r\ntake two or three minutes, and sometimes even  up\r\n\r\nto five minutes, to be cleared at the Immigration\r\n\r\ncounter.  If  there are 100 passengers  arriving,\r\n\r\nhow  long will that take to clear? It may be that\r\n\r\nthey are too busy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints that some of the\r\n\r\nstaff   on   duty  used  to  crack   jokes   among\r\n\r\nthemselves. They are thus wasting their  time  and\r\n\r\nprolonging  the  waiting time of  the  passengers.\r\n\r\nThis  is  uncalled  for,  and  I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  look  into  this  matter  and   take\r\n\r\nmeasures to remedy the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also complaints about the shortage of\r\n\r\nporters.  According to my information,  there  are\r\n\r\nonly  three  porters to cope with  more  than  100\r\n\r\npassengers.  Obviously this number is not  enough.\r\n\r\nIf at times the porters are weak, the luggage will\r\n\r\nbe  thrown  about because they cannot carry  them.\r\n\r\nThey are not able to cope with so many passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to bring all these complaints to the\r\n\r\nattention  of the Minister because the  number  of\r\n\r\ntourists  is  increasing  and  our  Government  is\r\n\r\nspending   a  lot  of  money  on  civil  aviation,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the development of the airport. We\r\n\r\nshould  see  to  it that our civil servants  there\r\n\r\nrender a high international standard of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is  only  a limited staff at  the  tax-free\r\n\r\nstore for passengers at the Transit section of the\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  Airport  to  cope  with  the  present\r\n\r\nincreased   passenger  load.

Perhaps, if he would care\r\n\r\nto  go  to the Arrival Lounge in the new Passenger\r\n\r\nTerminal- I believe it is upstairs - he  would  be\r\n\r\nable   to   see  a  few  counters  where   several\r\n\r\nImmigration officials are at work. I once  had  an\r\n\r\noccasion to visit this Terminal Building, and  saw\r\n\r\nquite  a  good number of passengers coming through\r\n\r\nthe  Lounge.  Judging from the  speed  with  which\r\n\r\nImmigration clearance was made, and this is  based\r\n\r\non  personal  experience, I think  the  Member  is\r\n\r\nexaggerating  when he says that it  takes  two  to\r\n\r\nthree minutes, or even five minutes, to clear each\r\n\r\npassenger. However, he is more or less correct  in\r\n\r\nhis  remarks about the Customs and Excise counter,\r\n\r\nbecause  over  there the passengers  upon  arrival\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  declare themselves, and  for  this\r\n\r\nreason  there  may be a little delay.  I  hope  my\r\n\r\nclarification   will   help   the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommunications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am always\r\n\r\ngrateful to Members sitting on the Opposite bench,\r\n\r\nanswering on my behalf. It does help now and again\r\n\r\nto have your ball at the other man's foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now refer to the point raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang regarding complaints against\r\n\r\nthe  Immigration  Department.  Strictly  speaking,\r\n\r\nthis   is   something  not  within  my  portfolio.\r\n\r\nImmigration Department comes under the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs,  and  my  colleague,  who  is   the\r\n\r\nMinister, is having a good laugh behind me. It  is\r\n\r\nquite  likely that the complaints received by  the\r\n\r\nMember  were  in  respect  of  persons  whom   the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department were quite  interested  in\r\n\r\nand, therefore, probably a little longer time  was\r\n\r\ntaken  before they could be cleared at the Arrival\r\n\r\nHall.  However, the Airport does provide  adequate\r\n\r\nfacilities for the Immigration Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, ever since the completion of the\r\n\r\nshort-term development of our Airport costing  $10\r\n\r\nmillion,  the floor area in the Passenger Terminal\r\n\r\nBuilding  has  been doubled from  over  a  hundred\r\n\r\nthousand  square feet to 270,000 square feet.  The\r\n\r\nclearance facilities for passengers in respect  of\r\n\r\nHealth,  Customs and Immigration have,  therefore,\r\n\r\nimproved. For the information of the Member, there\r\n\r\nare  six triangular counters corresponding to  six\r\n\r\nchannels  at  the  Arrival  Hall  for  Immigration\r\n\r\nauthorities   to   process   arriving   passengers\r\n\r\nsimultaneously. In addition, there are  two  other\r\n\r\ncounters behind the main Immigration counter to be\r\n\r\nused for checking arriving passengers who have  no\r\n\r\ndocuments   or   whose  documents  are   improper.\r\n\r\nProbably  these  are  the  people  who  have  been\r\n\r\ncomplaining to the Member. If they had the  proper\r\n\r\ndocuments, it would have been very simple for them\r\n\r\nto  gain entry into Singapore. In our view,  these\r\n\r\neight  Immigration counters are adequate  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  passenger arrivals even during  the  evening\r\n\r\npeak period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the complaint about baggage handling,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  under my portfolio and for which  I  am\r\n\r\nresponsible,  the  problem  has  probably   arisen\r\n\r\nbecause   there  is  more  than  one  organisation\r\n\r\nhandling the baggage. It is our intention to  have\r\n\r\none  Baggage Authority in the near future. Anyway,\r\n\r\nmay I say that even at this moment, there are four\r\n\r\ndifferent  organisations  handling  the   baggage.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the Malaysia-Singapore Airlines  handles\r\n\r\nbaggage of more than half of all the airlines that\r\n\r\ncome  into  Singapore.  There  are,  in  all,   24\r\n\r\ninternational  airlines. M.S.A, handles  at  least\r\n\r\none-half  the  number of airlines' bag-gages.  The\r\n\r\nothers  are Pan-American, Garuda and, lastly,  the\r\n\r\nCivil Aviation Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Aviation Department handles seven\r\n\r\nairlines.  Sir, if there is one authority,  we  do\r\n\r\nagree  that  it would be more efficient.  We  know\r\n\r\nexactly  who is responsible. But when an  aircraft\r\n\r\ncomes in and four authorities have got to find out\r\n\r\nwhich one of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  is  responsible, inevitably  some  delay  is\r\n\r\ninvolved.  Whatever it is, after the  $10  million\r\n\r\nshort-term development of the Airport, we now have\r\n\r\nat  the  Arrival Hall five conveyor belts for  the\r\n\r\nconveyance of baggage from the ramp to the baggage\r\n\r\nclaim area. In our view, these five conveyors  are\r\n\r\nadequate  to cope with the demand at peak periods.\r\n\r\nThe  time  taken for the baggage to be transported\r\n\r\nto  the Arrival Hall at the Airport depends on the\r\n\r\nhandling  capacity of the airline or agent,  which\r\n\r\nis  responsible  for it, and also  the  number  of\r\n\r\naircraft  that  lands at any one  given  time.  If\r\n\r\nthere were four landings within the space of  half\r\n\r\nan  hour, then of course there would be a big jam.\r\n\r\nIt  also  depends on the location of  the  parking\r\n\r\nbays  where  the  aircraft are ultimately  parked.\r\n\r\nAnyway, may I say that normally baggage should  be\r\n\r\navailable  for claiming in the baggage claim  area\r\n\r\nwithin  five  minutes after  the  arrival  of  the\r\n\r\naircraft which, I think, is a very good time.  And\r\n\r\nthis is the normal handling time undertaken by the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Civil  Aviation  for   the   seven\r\n\r\nairlines which it is in charge of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson,  he  understands that there is  not  enough\r\n\r\nstaff  for  the  tax-free  store  in  the  Transit\r\n\r\nlounge.  This  matter  will  be  conveyed  to  the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Civil Aviation to see that the store\r\n\r\ndoes  provide adequate staff. May I add, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthe  stores  at  our Airport are doing  such  good\r\n\r\nbusiness and, believe it or not, the rental for  a\r\n\r\nstore is not less than $40,000 a month, or half  a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars a year, because we have at  least\r\n\r\ntwo  million people -as many as the population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore-using  our Paya Lebar  Airport.  If  the\r\n\r\nconcessionaire  is  able to  pay  half  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars  in  rent for a store in the  Airport,  he\r\n\r\nwill  see  to it that there are more than adequate\r\n\r\nstaff  to  handle the business because more  staff\r\n\r\nmeans more business, and ultimately more profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the problem of hijacking\r\n\r\nof aircraft. As you know, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have\r\n\r\npassed   a   Bill  sometime  ago  to  enable   the\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  comply  with  the so-called Tokyo  Convention,\r\n\r\nwhich  takes strong measures against hijacking.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  our  staff  in the  Department  of  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation  is  quite wide awake to this possibility\r\n\r\nand,   together   with   the  representatives   of\r\n\r\ninternational airlines, they are taking all  steps\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  maximum security is  maintained.\r\n\r\nSometimes  it  may  bring  about  some  delay   to\r\n\r\npassengers  leaving or arriving at our Airport.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  if Members get complaints  in  future,\r\n\r\nthey will understand that it is not because we are\r\n\r\na  little  sticky about security, but  because  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  be a little longer on the ground  rather\r\n\r\nthan something to happen up in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the question whether or not Changi\r\n\r\nAirport can be used as an extension of Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nAirport  for  charter flights.  Sir,  there  is  a\r\n\r\npossibility that Changi Airport may be reverted to\r\n\r\ncivilian  use.  It is now being  reserved  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Defence. They want it as  a  military\r\n\r\nairport. But there is no reason why Changi Airport\r\n\r\nmay  not be partly used for civil aircraft if  air\r\n\r\ntraffic continues to increase. May I say that,  at\r\n\r\nthe  present  moment, Paya Lebar  Airport  is  not\r\n\r\nfully stretched. The present traffic is equivalent\r\n\r\nto  about 40 per cent of what it can take. As  and\r\n\r\nwhen it does come close to 80 or 90 per cent, then\r\n\r\nperhaps  we  can divert some of the chartered  air\r\n\r\nflights  from  Paya Lebar to Changi  Airport.  But\r\n\r\nshould  it be necessary for Paya Lebar Airport  to\r\n\r\nbe   closed,  we  do  have  arrangements   whereby\r\n\r\naircraft  are  advised to land at  Changi  Airport\r\n\r\ninstead.  So  there is really no  problem  to  use\r\n\r\nChangi  Airport  as  an extension  of  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nAirport, as and when the necessity arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, is\r\n\r\nit  the opinion of the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nthat what I have said does not exist?

This includes a ground  satellite\r\n\r\nstation   to  receive  meteorological  data   from\r\n\r\norbiting   satellites,  as   distinct   from   the\r\n\r\ntelecommunication satellite. There is also  a  10-centimetre   radar  at  Paya  Lebar   capable   of\r\n\r\ndetecting   storms  within  400  kilometres   from\r\n\r\nSingapore. There are also two other weather radars\r\n\r\nof  lesser  range at Changi and Tengah Aerodromes,\r\n\r\nand a new wind-finding radar and telecommunication\r\n\r\nequipment  for the prompt reception  of  computer-produced     weather    charts    from    overseas\r\n\r\nmeteorological   stations.  The  Department   also\r\n\r\nsupplied   a   large  volume  of  climatologically\r\n\r\ninformation    to   commercial   and    scientific\r\n\r\norganisations and Government departments for their\r\n\r\nvaried  purposes such as factory siting, off-shore\r\n\r\ndrilling operations, engineering construction  and\r\n\r\nalso air pollution studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the North-east monsoons, warnings of\r\n\r\nprolonged  and  heavy  rainfall  likely  to  cause\r\n\r\nflooding are broadcast over Radio and Television.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a daily weather outlook forecast  has\r\n\r\nbeen  issued  to  the press for publication  since\r\n\r\n1970.

This  means that an increase of  population\r\n\r\nand   the  development  of  commercial  and  trade\r\n\r\nservices  have  caused  an  increase  of  mail  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, thereby increasing the workload of  the\r\n\r\nPostal Department. Undeniably, the Postal Services\r\n\r\nDepartment  in Singapore has all along  enjoyed  a\r\n\r\nreputation  of  high standards, it  provides  very\r\n\r\ngood  service to the people of Singapore and is  a\r\n\r\nsource of our pride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, following the increase in population and\r\n\r\nof  requirements  and a shift in  population,  the\r\n\r\ndegree  of  efficiency has  been  affected.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult of this, I have received several complaints\r\n\r\nrecently   against  delays  in  the  delivery   of\r\n\r\ndomestic  mail.  It normally takes  about  two  to\r\n\r\nthree days to deliver a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nletter locally. This is quite true, because I have\r\n\r\nsome  personal experience. For example, a  certain\r\n\r\nfriend of mine rang me up one day and asked, \"Have\r\n\r\nyou  received  my invitation card?\"  I  told  him,\r\n\r\n\"No\". In reply, he said, \"Strange! This invitation\r\n\r\ncard was posted some three days ago.\" Sir, this is\r\n\r\nquite  a  frequent occurrence, and 1 believe  that\r\n\r\nother  Members  of this House may have  a  similar\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are signs of a lowering of standards\r\n\r\nof  efficiency, we must try to find a remedy. This\r\n\r\ncannot  be dismissed as a small matter and allowed\r\n\r\nto  deteriorate.  It will be a wrong  attitude  to\r\n\r\nadopt.  What  has caused the low standard  of  our\r\n\r\nPostal   Services  recently?  Is  it  because   of\r\n\r\nshortage of staff or poor allocation of duties? Or\r\n\r\nis  it  because of traffic congestion which causes\r\n\r\ndelay  to postal delivery? If it is a question  of\r\n\r\ntraffic congestion, it is within the portfolio  of\r\n\r\nthe  same  Minister. I would, therefore,  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister to explain and to find ways and means  to\r\n\r\nremedy this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to raise is the matter of\r\n\r\nwrong   delivery  of  mail.  I  have  on   several\r\n\r\noccasions   received  letters,  or   even   Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board bills, addressed to other  people.\r\n\r\nSo  I  have  to perform the duty of a  postman  to\r\n\r\nreturn these mails and letters. I think this wrong\r\n\r\ndelivery happened because the postmen are careless\r\n\r\nin  their duty. 1 have come across postmen who are\r\n\r\nmostly young people. The Department concerned must\r\n\r\nurge these young postmen to be more careful in the\r\n\r\ndelivery  of  letters, instead of  sending  Paul's\r\n\r\nletter to Peter. If it is an important letter that\r\n\r\nis  wrongly delivered or a love letter sent to the\r\n\r\nwrong  person,  then  it  will  create  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding and difficulty on the part of the\r\n\r\nrecipient. It may even cause the separation  of  a\r\n\r\ncouple.  I,  therefore, hope that the Minister  in\r\n\r\ncharge  will  take immediate steps to  remedy  the\r\n\r\nsituation  and  to  reduce  instances   of   wrong\r\n\r\ndelivery  of  letters  If this can  be  wiped  out\r\n\r\nentirely, this will be all the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

There is no doubt that I  also  have  to\r\n\r\ndraw   the   attention   of   the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommunications to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister had taken very serious measures for\r\n\r\nthe reorganisation of the Postal Department. It is\r\n\r\nmost  probable  that  during  the  reorganisation,\r\n\r\ndeliveries   were  delayed,  or  letters   wrongly\r\n\r\ndelivered.  So  because of reorganisation,  I  can\r\n\r\naccept the complaints. But today I do not think  I\r\n\r\ncan  accept complaints of delayed delivery because\r\n\r\nsome  postmen are using motor cycles, which  makes\r\n\r\nfor  fast  delivery. Formerly you would  get  your\r\n\r\nletter  at about 10 o'clock. But now when you  get\r\n\r\nto  your office at 8.30, you will get your  letter\r\n\r\nat  9 o'clock. `this delivery service is going  on\r\n\r\nvery smoothly and efficiently. I must congratulate\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Communications for  taking  such\r\n\r\nserious   action   to   reorganise   the    Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have to ask the Minister now about the use\r\n\r\nof  the  warehouse  in Nelson Road  as  a  sorting\r\n\r\nsection. What action has he taken to alleviate the\r\n\r\nvery   poor   conditions  that  the  workers   are\r\n\r\nexperiencing? On a hot day the heat  is  so  great\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  like an oven. Could the  ventilation\r\n\r\nsystem  be  improved with, say, the  provision  of\r\n\r\nsome  fans  and  make openings  in  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nwarehouse  as windows? The workers' health  is  in\r\n\r\ndanger all this time, and the conditions are  made\r\n\r\nworse  by  a  film  of  dust settling  around  the\r\n\r\nwarehouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the Maxwell Road postmen's quarters, the\r\n\r\ncommon bathroom and lavatories are very filthy.  I\r\n\r\nwonder   whether   the   Postmaster-General   will\r\n\r\nconsider recruiting an attendant, as has been done\r\n\r\npreviously,  to  maintain  the  toilets  of  these\r\n\r\nquarters.  Sir,  we  are having campaigns  against\r\n\r\npollution  and  we are also talking about  keeping\r\n\r\nSingapore clean. But yesterday when I went to  the\r\n\r\npostmen's quarters, I saw that everything was very\r\n\r\nbad.  The  lavatory  is  very  ugly,  and  in  the\r\n\r\nbathroom some of the window panes are broken,  and\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchicks  are worn out. At the backyard, nobody  has\r\n\r\nbeen  sweeping it, not like before when there  was\r\n\r\none  attendant  appointed to sweep  the  quarters.\r\n\r\nEven in the estates of the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard,  there are people to sweep the  flats.  Why\r\n\r\ndoes the Postmaster-General not employ one man  to\r\n\r\nsweep and clean the common lavatory and the common\r\n\r\nstaircase?  This is very bad for the  postmen  who\r\n\r\nare  living  there.  If you  go  to  the  personal\r\n\r\nquarters,  it  is  very  clean  and  decent,   but\r\n\r\noutside,  just because it is common  property  and\r\n\r\nused  by  everybody,  nobody  wants  to  take  the\r\n\r\ntrouble to clean it. You must have one man to look\r\n\r\nafter  it. Therefore, I ask the Minister,  without\r\n\r\nany  previous notice, to please visit the  Maxwell\r\n\r\nRoad postmen's quarters, and to take the necessary\r\n\r\nremedial action on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

That also has been done.  Now,  I  see\r\n\r\npostmen  in rural areas, as the Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nsaid, using scooters resulting in faster delivery.\r\n\r\nThere has been vast improvement in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunications,  if  not in the Telecommunications\r\n\r\nDepartment, then in the Postal Department. Let  us\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Ministry on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it looks as if\r\n\r\nit  would  not be necessary for me to  answer  the\r\n\r\ncriticisms by Members.

So I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  explanation  should satisfy  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang.   After  the  reorganisation   of   the\r\n\r\nDepartment,  with the assistance of  the  National\r\n\r\nProductivity  Centre, it is possible  for  letters\r\n\r\nwhich are posted before 1.00 p.m, in the city area\r\n\r\nto be delivered the same afternoon. That, I think,\r\n\r\nis  reasonably good service. On the whole, in  the\r\n\r\nurban areas there are two deliveries of mail - one\r\n\r\nin  the morning and one in the afternoon. For  the\r\n\r\noutlying rural areas, we are at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoment gearing for just one delivery each weekday.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the time will come when, with more  motor-cycles and motor-scooters, our postmen with  their\r\n\r\nnew  smart uniform will be seen in the rural areas\r\n\r\nmore often.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for wrong delivery of mail, this is possible in\r\n\r\nthe  best of circumstances. But it would be better\r\n\r\nif  such complaints can be made known to us rather\r\n\r\nthan  to  the Member for Sembawang. We  cannot  do\r\n\r\nvery much unless the complainants give us specific\r\n\r\ninformation. It is no use saying, \"I have received\r\n\r\na  letter which is not meant for me.\" But if  they\r\n\r\ncan give us more details - such as the address  of\r\n\r\nthe  mis-delivered item, the date and  approximate\r\n\r\ntime  it  happened  to enable  us  to  know  which\r\n\r\nparticular postman was on the beat and to ask  for\r\n\r\nan explanation  then we can do something about it.\r\n\r\nBut  the  postman may have a good explanation.  It\r\n\r\nmay  be  that the dogs in the rural areas  are  so\r\n\r\nfierce that he is unable to deliver the item,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore hands it over to the neighbour  who  has\r\n\r\nagreed  to  accept it. I mean, there may  be  good\r\n\r\nexplanations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the specific complaints from the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson. First, the Nelson Road Centre. I\r\n\r\nthink  he will agree with me that the movement  of\r\n\r\nthe  Parcels and Mail Centre from the General Post\r\n\r\nOffice  basement at Fullerton Building  to  Nelson\r\n\r\nRoad  is  an  improvement, because  it  was  quite\r\n\r\nunhealthy down at the basement. But it  is  to  be\r\n\r\nadmitted  that, having moved over to Nelson  Road,\r\n\r\nwhich  was,  in fact, a P.S.A, warehouse  and  not\r\n\r\nbuilt for the purposes of a postal department  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  not  really  a  proper  place  for  the\r\n\r\nParcels and Mail Centre, conditions existing there\r\n\r\nare  not as good as we would want them to be.  The\r\n\r\nmove was made in December last year, and so it  is\r\n\r\nalready three months since we have moved there. It\r\n\r\nis  also  admitted that unfortunately  there  were\r\n\r\nsome  inconveniences. However, renovation work  is\r\n\r\nalmost  completed, and we hope that  most  of  the\r\n\r\ninitial problems would have been sorted out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of a report in January 1971 by the\r\n\r\nOccupational Health and Safety Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C.,  the Ministry looked into  the  working\r\n\r\nconditions  at  the Nelson Road Centre  and  made\r\n\r\ncertain  recommendations which  were  immediately\r\n\r\ninvestigated  into,  and action  has  since  been\r\n\r\ntaken.  For  example, vacuum cleaners  have  been\r\n\r\npurchased  and 14 large wall extractor fans  have\r\n\r\nbeen  installed to improve the ventilation.  They\r\n\r\nare  currently looking into the various types  of\r\n\r\nfloor  varnishes  to reduce the problem  of  dust\r\n\r\naccumulation  on  the  floor.  And  we  hope   to\r\n\r\ncontinue  keeping a watch on any further defects,\r\n\r\nso that improvements can be made as we go along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Maxwell Road postal quarters, I\r\n\r\nam  sorry to hear from the Member for Anson  that\r\n\r\nhe  thinks  that  the place is quite  filthy.

I would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to look into this aspect of the  postal\r\n\r\nservices.  I  have  said that on  the  whole  our\r\n\r\nPostal  Services are very good. However,  because\r\n\r\nof  the increase in population recently, there is\r\n\r\nbound  to be a certain amount of delay and  wrong\r\n\r\ndelivery  of  mail.

Recently,  new  uniforms  were\r\n\r\nsupplied  to  the  Postal  Department.  With  the\r\n\r\nexception  of  the  name  tag  on  the  postman's\r\n\r\nuniform,  there  is  no indication  to  show  the\r\n\r\nvarious grades of postal workers. Could some sort\r\n\r\nof  distinguishing feature be introduced so  that\r\n\r\nmembers of the public can straightaway identify a\r\n\r\nmail  officer,  inspector, postman,  or  ordinary\r\n\r\npostman? Further, the tailoring of these uniforms\r\n\r\nis  of very poor standard, and it gets torn  very\r\n\r\neasily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also understand that the postal driver,\r\n\r\nwho  at times performs the duties of the ordinary\r\n\r\npostman,  is  given only three suits of  uniforms\r\n\r\nper  year, whereas an ordinary postman gets five.\r\n\r\nI would, therefore, suggest that these drivers be\r\n\r\nalso  given five sets of uniforms, like any other\r\n\r\nordinary postmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think I can answer the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Anson  rather  quickly.

I believe there is an increasing interest\r\n\r\nin stamp collecting among our school children and\r\n\r\nadults.  So  these  new issues would  be  welcome\r\n\r\nadditions for all these budding philatelists  and\r\n\r\nprofessional stamp collectors. What I wish to ask\r\n\r\nis the number of new issues of stamps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be made for this year. I would be grateful  if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Communications  would  be  kind\r\n\r\nenough  to  indicate the type and  number  of  new\r\n\r\nissues  of  stamps with the various denominations,\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Postal Department will be  introducing\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to point out to the\r\n\r\nMinister one aspect of these new stamp issues.  In\r\n\r\npast  years,  when  a  new  :issue  of  stamps  is\r\n\r\nintroduced,  pamphlets about the  new  issues  are\r\n\r\ndistributed  to  those who ask  for  them  at  the\r\n\r\nPhilatelic  Bureau of the General Post Office.  On\r\n\r\nsome  occasions  the  supplies  are  insufficient.\r\n\r\ne.g.,  sometime  last year, there  was  a  special\r\n\r\ncommemorative issue of the Festivals  series,  and\r\n\r\nthere  were  insufficient brochures to  go  round.\r\n\r\nThese Festival stamps were quite big and colourful\r\n\r\nand  there was a great demand for them.  But  when\r\n\r\napplications for brochures were made, the  Bureau\r\n\r\ncould  not  supply them, probably because  of  the\r\n\r\nlarge  demand for them. Nevertheless. I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will look into his matter as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I pointed out just now, there seems to\r\n\r\nbe  a  growing interest in stamp collecting. I  am\r\n\r\nhappy  to say that in one of the community centres\r\n\r\nin  Punggol, a  small stamp collecting  group  of\r\n\r\nabout  20  students and adults was set up sometime\r\n\r\nlast  year.  This group held regular meetings  and\r\n\r\nwith the interest generated among them, it has now\r\n\r\nswelled to about 70. I think this is a good start,\r\n\r\nand  I  hope  that  with the  advance  information\r\n\r\nprovided  for by the Postal Services  on  the  new\r\n\r\nissues,   other   groups   interested   in   stamp\r\n\r\ncollecting,  from  schools  and  other   community\r\n\r\ncentres, will he able to get the information  they\r\n\r\nwant on such new issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker.

It\r\n\r\nconsists of the Dance series, Mask series, and the\r\n\r\nMusical instruments series, ranging from one  cent\r\n\r\nto   $10.   It  is  normal  practice   in   postal\r\n\r\nadministrations  to change the  definitive  stamps\r\n\r\nevery three to four years. So we intend to produce\r\n\r\na  new definitive series for 1972-73 with about 14\r\n\r\ndenominations, also ranging from one cent to  $10.\r\n\r\nThis  new  series  is  in  the  process  of  being\r\n\r\ndesigned and, when ready, will be issued. What the\r\n\r\nMember  has  in  mind really was the commemorative\r\n\r\nissues  which. I think, had generated considerable\r\n\r\ninterest  ever since the Stamp Advisory  Committee\r\n\r\nwas appointed in 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past there were only one or two sets of\r\n\r\ncommemorative issues per 3ear. But since  1968  we\r\n\r\nhave  tried  to make it a normal policy  to  issue\r\n\r\nabout  four  or five sets of commemorative  issues\r\n\r\nper year. We have also given our local artists  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  design  our  stamps,  which  have\r\n\r\ncreated  so great an impact that even the  Punggol\r\n\r\nConstituency  has a stamp club, as stated  by  the\r\n\r\nMember.  For this year, we will have five sets  of\r\n\r\ncommemorative  issues depicting designs  based  on\r\n\r\ncoins,   art,   festival  (we  hope  without   any\r\n\r\ncontroversy), youth and shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the complaint that there were\r\n\r\ninsufficient   brochures  for  new   commemorative\r\n\r\nissues,  I am sure the new Chairman of the  Stamps\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Committee who is my Political Secretary,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Bukit Merah, will take note of the\r\n\r\ncomplaint. I am also sure that he will see  to  it\r\n\r\nthat  there wilt be more than adequate  copies  of\r\n\r\nthese  pamphlets and brochures in future, so  that\r\n\r\nsales  of  commemorative issues can  improve  and.\r\n\r\ntherefore,   it   means  more  revenue   for   our\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, before I withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment  I  would like to make  just  one  small\r\n\r\nobservation:  I was talking in terms  of  the  two\r\n\r\ntypes  of issues, i.e., the commemorative and  the\r\n\r\ndefinitive issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very grateful to the Minister for his\r\n\r\ndetailed reply, and I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $22,630,370 for Head 0705 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0706 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0706 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Ng Yeow Chong, J. F Conceicao, Ch'ng Jit Koon, Low Yong Nguan and P.

According to statistics there are  about\r\n\r\n140,000  motor cars alone. In addition, there  are\r\n\r\nbuses,   motor-cycles,   scooters,   trucks    and\r\n\r\nbicycles.  The total number of vehicles  is  about\r\n\r\nhalf a million. We can imagine the workload of the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to ask two\r\n\r\nquestions.  I  have received some complaints  from\r\n\r\nthe  public, and it is my duty to convey  them  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  concerned.  I  would  urge  him  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  these complaints and  to  remedy  any\r\n\r\nshortcomings, so that the department can carry out\r\n\r\nits  work efficiently. Firstly, some taxi  drivers\r\n\r\nhave  complained against certain R.O.V, officials\r\n\r\nwho  carry out routine inspection of taxis.  These\r\n\r\ninspectors are trying to make things difficult for\r\n\r\nthe taxi drivers. For example, on inspection of  a\r\n\r\ntaxi, the inspector will tell the taxi driver that\r\n\r\na  certain part of his taxi is defective, and that\r\n\r\nit  should  be corrected before it can be  passed.\r\n\r\nThe  taxi  driver will then have it repaired.  The\r\n\r\nnext day he will drive his taxi to the R.O.V, for\r\n\r\na  further  inspection, of course,  thinking  that\r\n\r\nthis  time  his taxi will pass the test.  But  the\r\n\r\nsame  inspector will take a hammer and  knock  the\r\n\r\ntaxi here and there, saying, \"No, no. This part is\r\n\r\nalso  faulty.\"  And  he might also  say  that  the\r\n\r\nengine is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnoisy and that it should be repaired. All this has\r\n\r\ncaused much dissatisfaction among taxi drivers. If\r\n\r\nthe  inspector could only tell the driver once for\r\n\r\nall  what  parts of the taxi are faulty  and  need\r\n\r\nrepair, which perhaps can be done in one day, then\r\n\r\nit will be convenient to the taxi drivers and also\r\n\r\navoid  another day's loss of earnings. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, if the allegation is true, then it shows that\r\n\r\nthe  inspector's approach is not correct.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   will   carry   out   a   detailed\r\n\r\ninvestigation to see whether there is any truth in\r\n\r\nsuch an allegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi drivers have also complained that there is\r\n\r\nalways  a  long queue at the R.O.V, whenever  they\r\n\r\nsend  their  taxis  there for inspection.  Certain\r\n\r\nofficers  are very discourteous in their  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards taxi drivers, although our Ministers  have\r\n\r\nalways told our civil servants to be courteous.  I\r\n\r\nhope the civil servants will take note of what the\r\n\r\nMinisters have said and maintain their services at\r\n\r\na high standard. I would urge the Minister to look\r\n\r\ninto these complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications on his success in  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the motor transport service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of improvement in bus\r\n\r\nservices  since  its  reorganisation  last   year.\r\n\r\nHowever,   one  can  still  see  some  old   buses\r\n\r\noperating  on the roads.. These old and  out-dated\r\n\r\nbuses should have been condemned long ago as scrap\r\n\r\nfor  the  national steel mill. Instead,  they  are\r\n\r\nstill  permitted to continue to operate, and  most\r\n\r\nof  them  are  polluting the air with their  smoky\r\n\r\nexhausts.  Besides,  these  old  buses  frequently\r\n\r\nbreak  down,  thereby upsetting the time  schedule\r\n\r\nand  causing great inconvenience to bus commuters.\r\n\r\nThere was an occasion when I had to travel by bus,\r\n\r\nand I had to  wait more than half an hour for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was later told by the bus conductor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the delay was due to the breakdown of a  bus\r\n\r\nof  the same service route somewhere on its return\r\n\r\ntrip  to  the  terminal. Sir, every morning  as  I\r\n\r\ntravel  from  Changi to the city, I often  see  at\r\n\r\nleast  one  or  two buses parked on the  roadside,\r\n\r\napparently  stalled with engine  trouble.  In  one\r\n\r\nmorning  alone I counted no less than five  buses,\r\n\r\nbelonging   to  two  bus  companies,  which   were\r\n\r\nrendered  inoperative  with engine  trouble.  They\r\n\r\nwere  parked  along  Changi Road  within  a  short\r\n\r\nstretch  of half a mile. This state of affairs  is\r\n\r\nhighly undesirable. Something must be done quickly\r\n\r\nto   rectify  this  situation.  Why  did  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies not replace the old buses with new ones,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  plan?  The  Government  should\r\n\r\ninitiate action to press the bus companies for  an\r\n\r\nearly   Replacement  with  new  buses.  Meanwhile,\r\n\r\naction  must be taken against bus companies  which\r\n\r\ndo  not  keep  their buses properly  serviced  and\r\n\r\nmaintained before putting them on the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  whether the law enforcement section  of\r\n\r\nthe  Registry  of  Vehicles  has  been  adequately\r\n\r\nstaffed,  and  whether these enforcement  officers\r\n\r\nhave been sent out to carry out their duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nthe  last Budget debate in 1971, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications informed the House that steps would\r\n\r\nbe  taken  to improve the standard o, driving  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of buses in the public transport  sector.\r\n\r\nThe Minister informed us that courses on courtesy,\r\n\r\nfirst aid, etc., would be run. Since that time  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard  a suggestion that one of the  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy our bus drivers seem to be in such a hurry  to\r\n\r\nget  from  one  place  to another  is  that  their\r\n\r\nschedules  impose a pressure on them. If  this  is\r\n\r\nso, can the Ministry not take such steps that will\r\n\r\nresult  in  more reasonable requirements  for  bus\r\n\r\ndrivers to keep to time schedules for bus routes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has raised a matter\r\n\r\nwhich  I would like to endorse. It relates to  the\r\n\r\nstandard of maintenance and operation of buses.  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  him  that one notices too  frequently\r\n\r\nbuses  breaking down and holding up traffic.  They\r\n\r\nalso  caused inconvenience to bus users. I am sure\r\n\r\nthat bus drivers will feel more disposed to listen\r\n\r\nto  advice given in courses on proper bus driving,\r\n\r\nif  pressure of route schedules was not  so  great\r\n\r\nand if buses were better maintained. In respect of\r\n\r\nthese  two points, can we be informed of  (a)  the\r\n\r\nprogress  of educational courses for bus  drivers,\r\n\r\nand  (b)  the  extent  to which  the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nVehicles  has  a say in the proper maintenance  of\r\n\r\nbuses, and to what extent is this right exercised?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were also told during the last Budget\r\n\r\ndebate  that  the  Ministry of Communications  was\r\n\r\nobserving   the   extent   to   which   pedestrian\r\n\r\nfacilities, for instance, overhead bridges,  zebra\r\n\r\ncrossings, and so on, were used. I recollect  that\r\n\r\nit  was  stated that consideration would be given,\r\n\r\nif necessary, to legislation against jay walking -\r\n\r\nlegislation,  of course, that would  concomitantly\r\n\r\nprotect pedestrians. Mr Speaker, Sir, it has  been\r\n\r\nfrequently  declared  that a large  proportion  of\r\n\r\nthose   killed  and  injured  in  road   accidents\r\n\r\nconsists of pedestrians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, special measures have to be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  protect pedestrians. The Minister  will\r\n\r\nrecollect  the extent to which our legislation  on\r\n\r\nsafety  helmets for scooterists and motor-cyclists\r\n\r\nand  pillion riders has helped to reduce  injuries\r\n\r\nand   even  the  number  of  deaths  arising  from\r\n\r\naccidents.  Of course, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the  real\r\n\r\nanswer  to the problem is education - to  persuade\r\n\r\npeople to be more careful and to be more conscious\r\n\r\nof  pedestrian hazards, and so on.  We  hear  that\r\n\r\nsolution quoted again and again. But the time  may\r\n\r\nbe  ripe for measures dependent on education  .and\r\n\r\nsocial   persuasion   to   be, strengthened   by\r\n\r\nlegislation.  Perhaps the Minister would  like  to\r\n\r\nenlighten us on that point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the motor transport  system  was\r\n\r\nimplemented  last year, drivers and conductors  of\r\n\r\nbuses    behaved,    to    everyone's    surprise,\r\n\r\nmarvellously. Unfortunately, time has proved  what\r\n\r\nthey really are. Daily, our travelling public have\r\n\r\nto  put  up  with  rude conductors,  inconsiderate\r\n\r\ndrivers who fail to stop at designated stops,  and\r\n\r\nthereby   causing  great  inconvenience   to   the\r\n\r\ntravelling   public.  The  buses   too   are   not\r\n\r\nmaintained properly. Quite often these buses break\r\n\r\ndown  at  odd places and cause great inconvenience\r\n\r\nto  other road users. The bus companies should  be\r\n\r\npulled up for allowing faulty buses to run on  the\r\n\r\nroads. Many of these buses run around without  any\r\n\r\npetrol  filler caps. As such, when they  negotiate\r\n\r\nturns, they leave a trail of oil on the roads. Any\r\n\r\nmotor-cyclist  will know what this  trail  of  oil\r\n\r\nwill  lead  to  eventually. It is high  time  that\r\n\r\ncompanies   were   fined  for   taking   such   an\r\n\r\nirresponsible attitude towards the safety  of  the\r\n\r\nordinary road user.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there is an acute shortage of buses\r\n\r\nrunning certain routes. It is high time that  more\r\n\r\nbuses  were put into operation. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nbus  drivers should be given better conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice,  such  as  vacation  leave  and   medical\r\n\r\nbenefits. May I also know whether the increase  in\r\n\r\nfines  for  traffic offences has proved  to  be  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent, and has it in any way produced  better\r\n\r\nstandards of driving and ease on the roads? It  is\r\n\r\nmy  view that this is not so. Has the Registrar of\r\n\r\nVehicles   exploited  the  possibility  of   using\r\n\r\ntelevision   as  a  medium  for  instructing   and\r\n\r\neducating  Singaporeans  in  better  standards  of\r\n\r\ndriving?  There  seems  to  he  a  great  lack  of\r\n\r\ncourtesy and goodwill on our roads at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the views\r\n\r\nexpressed  by various Members of this House  about\r\n\r\nour   buses.  Since  the  implementation  of   the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of  motor  transport   system   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,    there   has   been   some    general\r\n\r\nimprovement    of    our    transport     system.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, after the closing down of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction Company, bus commuters  still\r\n\r\nhave  to wait very long for buses. Also, the buses\r\n\r\nare very overcrowded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a good number of the old buses are very\r\n\r\ndirty.  We  can  see black smoke coming  from  the\r\n\r\nexhaust  pipes,  seats  with  the  cushion   badly\r\n\r\ndamaged, windows cannot be shut  when  it  rains.\r\n\r\nThese  old  buses are littered with used  tickets,\r\n\r\npaper, and other rubbish. Perhaps they have  never\r\n\r\nbeen  swept  for months. The noise  from  the  old\r\n\r\nengines  is so terrible that if you sit  near  the\r\n\r\nfront portion of the bus, you will at times get  a\r\n\r\nterrific   headache  as  well.  There  have   been\r\n\r\nfrequent  breakdowns of these  old  buses  causing\r\n\r\ntraffic jams here and there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly urge that these old buses should\r\n\r\nnot be allowed to carry commuters any more, as  it\r\n\r\nis  very  dangerous  to do so.  I  would  strongly\r\n\r\nsuggest that the Registry of Vehicles should  give\r\n\r\nanother  check  on all these buses to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nsafety of bus commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take this opportunity to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Communications how many  new  buses\r\n\r\nhave  been  bought and put to use by all  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies   since   the  implementation   of   the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of  the motor transport  service?\r\n\r\nAnd  would  he be kind enough to request  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  to `put more new buses on  the  various\r\n\r\nroutes  to ease the present overcrowding  and  the\r\n\r\nunnecessarily long waiting for the buses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I propose to\r\n\r\ndeal  first with the complaints mentioned by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang. I appreciate the fact  that\r\n\r\nin  his  criticism  he did say that  some  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of the staff in the Registry of  Vehicles\r\n\r\nwould appear to be difficult when it comes to  the\r\n\r\nquestion of inspection of taxis. I appreciate his\r\n\r\nuse  of  the word \"some\" because it is not just  a\r\n\r\nwide sweep that the whole department is proving to\r\n\r\nbe  difficult,  but some may  be  difficult.  The\r\n\r\nMember's  complaint  is to  the  effect  that  the\r\n\r\nvehicle  inspectors do not give the taxi owner  or\r\n\r\ndriver a full list of all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  complaints as to where the taxis have failed\r\n\r\nto  come  up to the required mark and would  need\r\n\r\nattention and repair in order to get a clearance.\r\n\r\nAnd  that instead, the vehicle inspectors  would,\r\n\r\nafter   pointing  out  one  complaint  which   is\r\n\r\nsubsequently attended to, then look  for  another\r\n\r\ncomplaint  and  send them away. It  would  appear\r\n\r\nthat  this  state  of affairs  did  unfortunately\r\n\r\nexist  during the months of June, July and August\r\n\r\nof  last  year. But I am pleased to say that  the\r\n\r\ndepartment   has,   since  August,   considerably\r\n\r\nimproved  the  situation, and  the  inconvenience\r\n\r\ncaused  to taxi drivers should not now arise.  It\r\n\r\nis  quite  possible that the complaint  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  has  received is not a  recent  one,  but\r\n\r\nperhaps  a fairly long outstanding one  which  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  something of the past. But  if  `there\r\n\r\nare  more  complaints of this nature, I  hope  he\r\n\r\nwill be good enough to forward the particulars to\r\n\r\nus  so that, while they are fresh in the minds of\r\n\r\neveryone, we will be able to deal with them  much\r\n\r\nmore quickly and have the matter rectified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for rudeness on the part of an official, as\r\n\r\nstated  by  the Member, it is the policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not to encourage rudeness on the  part\r\n\r\nof  any  public  official to the members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic. If there are cases of such a nature, will\r\n\r\nhe  be good enough to advise the complainant  `to\r\n\r\nsubmit  his  complaint, and the  matter  will  be\r\n\r\nlooked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to move on to the comments of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Katong, first, before  coming  to\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Mountbatten. There seems to be  a\r\n\r\ngeneral complaint that some bus drivers are rude.\r\n\r\nThat  is  also  the complaint of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  - that bus commuters appear to be harassed\r\n\r\nby  very crude bus drivers. Courtesy is something\r\n\r\nthat  takes some time to inculcate. It is  either\r\n\r\nin  you or not in you, in which case you have got\r\n\r\nto  be  educated. And education is  a  very  long\r\n\r\nprocess.  Sometimes I feel that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong,  who is associated with adult  education,\r\n\r\nseems to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlittle  confidence in the efficacy  of  education\r\n\r\nwith respect to improvement of human nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I clarify? My\r\n\r\nview  is  that one of the best forms of education\r\n\r\nis legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I hope Members will agree that\r\n\r\nit  is  not  necessary to legislate in  order  to\r\n\r\neducate.  One  would think that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong is a very impatient man. I think we should\r\n\r\nnot  resort  to  legislation  unless  as  a  last\r\n\r\nresort.  I  think  we should  talk,  educate  and\r\n\r\npersuade until we are blue in the face and, if it\r\n\r\ndoes   not   work,   then   perhaps   resort   to\r\n\r\nlegislation.  So with regard to his  request,  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the  fact  that  legislation  for   the\r\n\r\ncompulsory use of crash helmets has been a  great\r\n\r\nsuccess,  whether or not it is time to  introduce\r\n\r\nlegislation against jay walking, I would say that\r\n\r\nI am a patient man and a very patient Minister. I\r\n\r\nwould  still say that it is not time yet, as  far\r\n\r\nas  I  can  help  it,  to  introduce  legislation\r\n\r\nagainst jay walking. Perhaps this time next  year\r\n\r\nI  may  change my mind if he raises  the  subject\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that there is a very' tight\r\n\r\nschedule  for  bus drivers to bring  their  buses\r\n\r\nback  to the terminals. Otherwise, if there  were\r\n\r\nno  proper  bus schedules, complaints would  come\r\n\r\nfrom the bus commuters that `they had to wait not\r\n\r\nhalf an hour but probably one hour for the buses,\r\n\r\nin  which  case  the  complaints  would  be  even\r\n\r\nlouder.  Of course,, we do not believe  that  bus\r\n\r\nschedules, should be so tight that drivers should\r\n\r\nbe   reckless  or  that  we  encourage  negligent\r\n\r\ndriving. Far from it. We will take action  if  it\r\n\r\nis  proved  that the driver or the conductor  has\r\n\r\nbeen negligent in the execution of his duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for maintenance of buses, I think bus\r\n\r\noperators themselves realise that, if they keep a\r\n\r\nproper  maintenance of their vehicles, they  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to get more out of their buses. Firstly,\r\n\r\nthere will be savings in fuel and the buses  will\r\n\r\nbe'  able  to  run  for longer periods  of  time,\r\n\r\nbecause  when a bus is on the road it is  earning\r\n\r\nmoney.  I  think  it is in the  interest  of  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies themselves to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensure  that  there is proper maintenance.  It  is\r\n\r\npossible  that sometimes the buses are  unable  to\r\n\r\nkeep  to  the schedule and may be in a  very  poor\r\n\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Anson who, speaking\r\n\r\non  behalf of bus workers, said that there  should\r\n\r\nbe  an  improvement  in their working  conditions,\r\n\r\nvacation  leave,  etc.  Here  again,  a  good  bus\r\n\r\noperator  as an employer will see to it  that  his\r\n\r\nworkers  are  reasonably paid, with adequate  time\r\n\r\nfor rest and recreation, and therefore they should\r\n\r\nbe  able to give maximum service. I think I  would\r\n\r\nbe  exceeding my authority if I tried to say  more\r\n\r\nthan  this,  in  other  words,  to  tell  the  bus\r\n\r\noperator  how  to  be  a  good  employer.  It   is\r\n\r\nunderstood  that it would be in the bus operator's\r\n\r\ninterest  to  be  a  good model  employer  to  his\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  leave it to the union  leaders  who\r\n\r\nspeak  on  behalf of the bus workers to  negotiate\r\n\r\nwith  the  employer concerned; and  we  wish  both\r\n\r\nsides the best of luck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Member for Mountbatten. Before\r\n\r\ncoming to his question of scrapping old buses  and\r\n\r\nso  on  and so forth, he has asked when would  the\r\n\r\nEnforcement Section of the Registry of Vehicles be\r\n\r\noperative.  I am pleased to say that this  section\r\n\r\nis   almost  ready  to  begin  its  work.  We  had\r\n\r\nrecommended   under  the  White   Paper   on   the\r\n\r\nReorganisation of the Motor Transport  Service  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, which was tabled in this House in July,\r\n\r\n1970,  Command  Paper 21, the  recruitment  of  80\r\n\r\npolicemen  with 40 motor-cycles to be attached  to\r\n\r\nthe  Registry  of  Vehicles. We  expect  this  new\r\n\r\nEnforcement  Section to be operational  in  April,\r\n\r\n1972,  which means 10 days from now. As  early  as\r\n\r\nJuly  1971, an Assistant Superintendent of  Police\r\n\r\nwas  seconded to the Registry of Vehicles  to  get\r\n\r\nacquainted with the work involved and to  lay  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  groundwork. Thirty  policemen  and  two\r\n\r\nsergeants were posted to the Registry of  Vehicles\r\n\r\nin  January this year. The motor-cycles have  also\r\n\r\narrived and are registered with distinct numbers -\r\n\r\nROV.l  to  ROV.40. We do not have  to  ballot  for\r\n\r\nthese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumbers.  They are for free! The present  recruits\r\n\r\nare  now  undergoing motor-cycle  training,  which\r\n\r\nwould be completed in a week's time. A further  30\r\n\r\npolicemen and an Inspector of Police are  expected\r\n\r\nto  join  this  Section by  June  this  year.  The\r\n\r\nofficers  in this Section are basically  policemen\r\n\r\nand  are  vested with all the powers of  a  police\r\n\r\nofficer.  However, they will generally concentrate\r\n\r\non  the conduct of drivers, especially drivers  of\r\n\r\npublic   service  vehicles,  and  on  the  general\r\n\r\ncondition  of motor vehicles to ensure  that  they\r\n\r\nare  mechanically safe and sound.  These  officers\r\n\r\nwill  complement  the traffic police  strength  in\r\n\r\nantipollution campaigns against motor vehicles. In\r\n\r\norder  that this special force is to be  respected\r\n\r\nrather  than  feared, they will be  instructed  to\r\n\r\nachieve  their  objective  through  education  and\r\n\r\npersuasion  and, when necessary,  only  by  strict\r\n\r\nenforcement of the rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the main crux of the complaints\r\n\r\nfrom   Members  of  the  House.  The  Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten has suggested that old buses should be\r\n\r\nscrapped and the Member for Anson complained  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  shortage of buses, followed  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Bukit Ho Swee who complained that  the\r\n\r\nnoise  of  the  engines  of  some  old  buses  are\r\n\r\nterrible.  He  has also asked how many  new  buses\r\n\r\nhave  been operating since reorganisation.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot denied that many buses which are still running\r\n\r\nare  in  such poor condition that they  should  be\r\n\r\nscrapped  and  replaced by newer  buses.  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  Members of this House and the  public\r\n\r\nthat we should ponder a little over this matter to\r\n\r\nsee  whether we are pushing matters too  hard  too\r\n\r\nsoon against our bus operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we refer to the White Paper (Command 21 of\r\n\r\n1970) tabled in this House on the 21st July, 1970,\r\n\r\non  the  Reorganisation  of  the  Motor  Transport\r\n\r\nService  of Singapore, according to paragraph  4.3\r\n\r\nthe 10 Chinese bus companies had a total bus fleet\r\n\r\nof  only  768 buses. That was two years  ago  when\r\n\r\nthis  Report was published. But at the end of last\r\n\r\nmonth,  February,  1972, the total  bus  fleet  of\r\n\r\nthese three Chinese bus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies - the previous 10 companies were  merged\r\n\r\ninto  three  companies  -was  1,988  buses,  which\r\n\r\nrepresents an increase of 1.220 buses, or close to\r\n\r\n150 per cent of the fleet which existed `two years\r\n\r\nago.  Even if allowance has been made for the fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  ex-Singapore Traction Company fleet  of\r\n\r\n407 buses were acquired by the three companies  in\r\n\r\nDecember,  1971, i.e., three months  ago,  at  the\r\n\r\nprice  of $2,750,000, Members should bear in  mind\r\n\r\nwhat  the cost is to the operators for the balance\r\n\r\nof  the increased fleet of over 800 new buses -800\r\n\r\nover  the  last two years. Assuming that each  new\r\n\r\nbus costs $40,000 - it could be $40,000 or $50,000\r\n\r\ndepending on the size of the bus, but let us  work\r\n\r\non  the  average  of  $40,000 -  these  three  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies had to find the resources over the  past\r\n\r\ntwo  years  to invest a sum of not less than  over\r\n\r\n$30  million. This is not an insignificant  amount\r\n\r\nby  any  standards; it is not $3 million,  or  $10\r\n\r\nmillion, but over $30 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just one year ago since the massive\r\n\r\nreorganisation of our public bus services was  put\r\n\r\ninto  effect in April, 1971. Had the S.T.C, taken\r\n\r\nour  advice as contained in the White Paper  para.\r\n\r\n4.15 - STC to be reorganised - that reorganisation\r\n\r\nwas  coming  and that it would lose its privileged\r\n\r\nposition as the bus company of Singapore since the\r\n\r\nother three amalgamated companies are coming in as\r\n\r\nequal  competitors, then today, after one year  of\r\n\r\nreorganisation,  everything  would  have   settled\r\n\r\ndown.  But  they  did  not  take  the  advice  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  had to intervene three months  ago  in\r\n\r\nearly  December  to  prevent  a  collapse  of  STC\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the present three bus companies,\r\n\r\nAmalgamated  Bus  Company (blue),  Associated  Bus\r\n\r\nServices   (red),  and  the  United  Bus   Company\r\n\r\n(yellow), had risen to the occasion by taking over\r\n\r\nthe  running of the former STC services. The  full\r\n\r\noperation of ex-STC services resumed with  only  a\r\n\r\nbreak of 24 hours. What is most appreciative on my\r\n\r\npart was their willingness to take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover  all the 1,700 drivers and conductors of STC,\r\n\r\nas   otherwise  these  people  would   have   been\r\n\r\nunemployed. Therefore, the smooth progress of  the\r\n\r\nbus  service  reorganisation has suffered  only  a\r\n\r\ntemporary setback because of the collapse  of  STC\r\n\r\nand  it is only fair that we should give the three\r\n\r\nbus companies reasonable time to adjust themselves\r\n\r\nto  this  new  situation. Only three  months  have\r\n\r\npassed,  and therefore we cannot pass judgment  on\r\n\r\nthe adequacy of our bus services at this juncture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the state of the bus services in\r\n\r\nSingapore  a year ago? Take April 1972 as  against\r\n\r\nApril  1971, and again, against April  1970,  what\r\n\r\nwas  it  then?  Let us give thought to  the  first\r\n\r\nbefore  we  begin  to  be  critical.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nalthough the White Paper lays down an age limit of\r\n\r\n17 years for public buses, it is felt that our bus\r\n\r\noperators will, of their own accord, replace buses\r\n\r\neven before they have reached the age limit of  17\r\n\r\nyears.  Singapore's bus commuters  are  so  choosy\r\n\r\nthat  when  an old bus comes along they  will  not\r\n\r\nboard  it. They prefer to wait for another 10,  15\r\n\r\nor  even  20 minutes for a new bus to come  along,\r\n\r\nand bus operators are aware of this. They know how\r\n\r\nselective bus commuters can be, and they will,  of\r\n\r\ntheir own accord, quickly replace them long before\r\n\r\nthe age limit is reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> They want to make their money's\r\n\r\nworth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I do not blame them.

For the information of Members,\r\n\r\nover  the  past  year  we have  imposed  financial\r\n\r\npenalties  on  the  bus  companies  -against   the\r\n\r\nAmalgamated  Bus Company, $1,600,  Associated  Bus\r\n\r\nServices,   $13,200,  and  United   Bus   Company,\r\n\r\n$17,400.  If we find that they are not putting  on\r\n\r\nthe  routes as many buses as they are supposed to,\r\n\r\nand  they have been checked and found wanting,  we\r\n\r\npenalise  them $2,000 a bus that is found lacking.\r\n\r\nThis  is the screw that we are tightening on them.\r\n\r\nBut, I think, we should be fair. They have made  a\r\n\r\ngreat  effort  to bring in more than  $30  million\r\n\r\ninvestment  in the buses - 800 new  buses  on  the\r\n\r\nroad  over the last two years, which is fantastic.\r\n\r\nThat  is as big a fleet as we ever had in donkey's\r\n\r\nyears.

As we know that all three  of\r\n\r\nthem  are Presidents of Teachers' Unions,  I  will\r\n\r\nleave  it to them to take up the professional  and\r\n\r\nindustrial problems of teachers and the  Education\r\n\r\nService in general. I will confine myself to those\r\n\r\naspects  which  affect teachers and  pupils  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems I wish to raise is the high\r\n\r\ncost  of education in Singapore. Let me hasten  to\r\n\r\nadd,  Sir,  the high cost of education to  certain\r\n\r\ncategories of people, that is (1) the lower income\r\n\r\ngroup, and (2) the over-worked pupils in secondary\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are aware of the emphasis on technical\r\n\r\neducation  and participation in uniformed  groups.\r\n\r\nIn  the  case  of  the lower income  groups,  this\r\n\r\nemphasis  is  costing  more  than  what  they  can\r\n\r\nafford. I have spoken on this subject once before.\r\n\r\nThis   policy   does  not  appear  to   give   any\r\n\r\nconsideration to the minimisation of the  economic\r\n\r\neffect of the readjustment of its policies on  the\r\n\r\nparents of the students concerned. While it is not\r\n\r\npossible for the Government to implement a  scheme\r\n\r\nof  free  secondary education,  it  is  reasonably\r\n\r\nexpected  of  the  Government to  bring  secondary\r\n\r\neducation within the means of as many citizens  as\r\n\r\npossible.  Many citizens, particularly those  from\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income group, have found the  cost  of\r\n\r\neducating  their children to secondary level  very\r\n\r\nexpensive.  A student in the secondary school  has\r\n\r\nto pay a school fee of $4 per month, plus a fee of\r\n\r\n$2  for miscellaneous purposes thus making a total\r\n\r\nof  $6  per  month.  The  only  students  who  are\r\n\r\nexempted  from  the  payment  of  such  fees   are\r\n\r\nstudents of Malay origin. Others, even those whose\r\n\r\nparents  are in receipt of public assistance  from\r\n\r\nthe Social Welfare Department, are expected to pay\r\n\r\nat  least  a fee of $1 for miscellaneous purposes.\r\n\r\nConditions prescribed by the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nfor the remission of school fees from $6 per month\r\n\r\nto $1 per month are extremely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrigid and restrictive to such an extent that it is\r\n\r\nimpossible for the student from a family  of  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  financial circumstances to  be  granted\r\n\r\nsuch  a  remission  of school  fees.  One  of  the\r\n\r\nconditions  is  that the family  income  does  not\r\n\r\nexceed  $200 per month, and the other is that  the\r\n\r\nremission, if granted, is subject to a maximum  of\r\n\r\n10 per cent of the total enrolment in each school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other expenses involved in respect of\r\n\r\npupils, especially from the lower income group. If\r\n\r\nthe  schools are far from their homes,  invariably\r\n\r\nthey are, the children will have to remain be-hind\r\n\r\nin  school  at  least  twice  a  week  for  extra-curricular activities and technical classes.  This\r\n\r\ninvolves additional expenses for meals as well  as\r\n\r\nadditional  transport  where  workshops  are   not\r\n\r\nlocated close to the school where the children are\r\n\r\nadmitted.  I  have  known of lower  in-come  group\r\n\r\nparents,  especially those earning $200  or  less,\r\n\r\ncomplaining  that it costs them at least  $30  per\r\n\r\nmonth to keep each child in a secondary school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to this monthly recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  there  are  some  expenses  at   the\r\n\r\nbeginning of the school term, such as the purchase\r\n\r\nof   books,   drawing  boards,  workshop   aprons,\r\n\r\ngeometrical instruments, etc., which are  required\r\n\r\nfor  technical  classes. A system of  loan  scheme\r\n\r\nshould be devised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Government's policy of\r\n\r\nrequiring every pupil to be enrolled in  at  least\r\n\r\none uniformed group in a school. I have known that\r\n\r\nin  some schools uniforms have to be purchased  by\r\n\r\nthe  students  themselves. In certain  cases  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  buy  two  sets  of  uniforms,  one   for\r\n\r\nceremonial  purposes.  We are  encouraging  school\r\n\r\nbands to be formed. In many schools, uniforms  for\r\n\r\nthe  bands are not provided and therefore children\r\n\r\nfrom  poor  homes, even if they are  talented  and\r\n\r\ninterested  in  joining the  bands,  feel  shy  of\r\n\r\njoining them just because they cannot afford it. I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister will look into the possibility\r\n\r\nof  providing these uniforms free-of-charge  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  returned to the school  when  the  pupil\r\n\r\nleaves  the  school,  or  is  no  longer  in   the\r\n\r\nuniformed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroup. This is being done in some schools, but not\r\n\r\nall. Surely we do not want participation in school\r\n\r\nbands to be the exclusive right of only those  who\r\n\r\ncan afford it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another common complaint of parents with\r\n\r\nchildren in secondary schools is the heavy load on\r\n\r\nthe school curricula. I have heard complaints from\r\n\r\nparents  that  secondary school pupils  have  very\r\n\r\nlittle time for homework and for home environment.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  speak  this  with  some  experience   and\r\n\r\nauthority.  I have the same complaint. The  pupils\r\n\r\nspend  very little time in the house as  they  are\r\n\r\nrequired  for extra-curricular activities,  games,\r\n\r\nsports, etc., at least three to four times a week,\r\n\r\neither in the evenings or mornings, outside  their\r\n\r\nregular  school  hours.  Education  should  be  an\r\n\r\nenjoyable process and not a burdensome one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind hon.

That  is what I would  call  back-bone\r\n\r\neducation.  In  other words, the children  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious   communities  should  receive  a  certain\r\n\r\namount  of education in their mother tongue.  Sir,\r\n\r\nall  along we have emphasised that children should\r\n\r\nfirst  receive  education in their mother  tongue,\r\n\r\nand at the same time learning a second language in\r\n\r\norder to fit them into the multi-lingual and multi-cultural  context of our country. Indeed,  parents\r\n\r\nin  general appreciate the value of mother  tongue\r\n\r\neducation. But may I know why many parents do  not\r\n\r\nwant  their  children  to  receive  mother  tongue\r\n\r\neducation in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  first instance? If this can be satisfactorily\r\n\r\nanswered, then our back-bone education will  be  a\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education has made\r\n\r\nconsiderable  praiseworthy efforts.  There  is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  about it. But on the other hand,  there  is\r\n\r\nstill  plenty of room for drastic improvements  in\r\n\r\nour  education  system.  We  all  appreciate  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  thrives on international trade.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  multi-racial Republic. We also appreciate\r\n\r\nthat  English is used as a medium of communication\r\n\r\nfor  promoting inter-communal understanding in our\r\n\r\nown  country. It is also a language of science and\r\n\r\ntechnology.  But while our economy and  technology\r\n\r\nare  making  a  headway, we must  also  pay  equal\r\n\r\nattention, if not more, to other values which have\r\n\r\nbeen  acquired as a result of over 4,000 years  of\r\n\r\nexperience  and cultural traditions.  Parents,  in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  understand the value of  this.  However,\r\n\r\nbecause  they are unable to have the cake and  eat\r\n\r\nit,  they send their children to a language stream\r\n\r\nother than their own. This is indeed a matter  for\r\n\r\nregret.  As  a  Government, we must think  of  the\r\n\r\ninterests and future of our next generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must find ways and means to ensure that every\r\n\r\nchild  receives an education in the mother  tongue\r\n\r\nfirst  and, at the same time, improves his  second\r\n\r\nlanguage, so that secondary school leavers will be\r\n\r\neffectively  bi-lingual. If we  can  achieve  this\r\n\r\naim,  then I believe many parents will send  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to schools to receive education  in  the\r\n\r\nmother tongue first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education systems in the world vary from\r\n\r\ncountry  to country. In my opinion, in the context\r\n\r\nof  our multilingual and multi-racial society, the\r\n\r\npresent  system of a six-year period  for  primary\r\n\r\neducation  should be extended to seven years.  The\r\n\r\nseven-year  period will be allocated  as  follows.\r\n\r\nFor  the first six years, every child will receive\r\n\r\neducation in his mother tongue which, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,   prepares  a  foundation  for  the   second\r\n\r\nlanguage.  The  seventh  year  will  be   reserved\r\n\r\nentirely for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  teaching  of  a second language,  except  for\r\n\r\ncertain periods to be reserved for the teaching of\r\n\r\nthe mother tongue. At the end of the seventh year,\r\n\r\nthe  parents will then decide to which  stream  of\r\n\r\neducation  they  wish to send  their  children.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  in  this way  we  can  ensure  that\r\n\r\nchildren   from  any  language  stream   will   be\r\n\r\neffectively   bilingual  at  the  end   of   their\r\n\r\nsecondary education. In this way, we would be able\r\n\r\nto  bring our policy of bi-lingual education to  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  conclusion.  I  think  there  is  an\r\n\r\nurgent  task  ahead for a reform in our  education\r\n\r\nsystem. If we still maintain the present system of\r\n\r\nsix  years  for primary education and continue  to\r\n\r\nincrease the teaching time for second language  at\r\n\r\nthe expense of the mother tongue, then it will not\r\n\r\nhelp  us  in  our policy of bi-lingual  education.\r\n\r\nThis  is  my  opinion. It is no  solution  to  our\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next I would like to talk about schools in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas, in particular, the aided schools.\r\n\r\nThe  school  premises in the rural areas  are  far\r\n\r\nfrom  ideal. In the past when aided schools  first\r\n\r\naccepted   the  full  grant-in-aid   system,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  undertook to grant a dollar-for-dollar\r\n\r\naid  for  the  building of schools.  But  recently\r\n\r\nthere  has been some modification to this  dollar-for-dollar system. The capital grant is  now  made\r\n\r\non  the basis of the performance of the school. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  this is not in  keeping  with  the\r\n\r\nactual  circumstances of the schools in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  in  which  the members  of  the  Board  of\r\n\r\nDirectors are not very rich people. They  have  to\r\n\r\nwork  very  hard  to  be able to  raise  money  to\r\n\r\nrebuild   their   old   and   dilapidated   school\r\n\r\nbuildings.  Very often they have  to  spend  large\r\n\r\nsums  of money to build school lavatories, leaving\r\n\r\nonly  a  meagre sum for the main building  itself.\r\n\r\nMost of the school premises are made of planks and\r\n\r\nattap  leaves for the roof. Are we to allow  these\r\n\r\nold  and  dilapidated huts to continue as schools?\r\n\r\nSir,    we   must   understand   that   in    such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the progress of the schools in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas will be impeded.\r\n\r\nStudents and teachers could not -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up, Mr Tay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will confine\r\n\r\nmyself  to  three matters under this  subhead.  My\r\n\r\nfirst  question  is  in regard  to  the  posts  of\r\n\r\nTeachers-, in-Training. 118 such posts  have  been\r\n\r\nabolished,  as shown in page 177 of the Estimates.\r\n\r\nIn other words, these posts of Teacher-in-Training\r\n\r\ndo  not exist any more. I would like to know  from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education the reason  why  these\r\n\r\nposts  have been abolished, and why will there  be\r\n\r\nno  more  intake in the Teachers' Training College\r\n\r\nin 1972-73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question concerns the problem of\r\n\r\nrelief teachers. We had occasion last year to hear\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of State for Education mention  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  then  a  very high  number  of  relief\r\n\r\nteachers  required  for various  reasons  to  fill\r\n\r\nvacancies  or  to  relieve  those  who   were   on\r\n\r\nmaternity  leave, sick leave, or on retirement.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  some of these relief  teachers  are\r\n\r\ngraduates, and some are not. However, some of them\r\n\r\nare  suitably  qualified, and I am just  wondering\r\n\r\nwhether  they have any opportunity to be  absorbed\r\n\r\ninto the Education Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point concerns T.T.C, graduates required\r\n\r\nto  step in as relief teachers. I understand  that\r\n\r\nthe next batch of T.T.C, graduates will be passing\r\n\r\nout   sometime  this  year.  Therefore,  with  the\r\n\r\nproblem of relief teachers being resolved, another\r\n\r\nattendant problem will arise - how to absorb  this\r\n\r\nyear's  batch  of  graduates  into  the  Education\r\n\r\nService,, and what of future batches?  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  there are plans to see  that  there\r\n\r\nwill  be no occasion for the supply to exceed  the\r\n\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I can come to the types of courses which\r\n\r\nwere  organised  sometime ago by the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.  These are in-service training  courses\r\n\r\nfor  teachers to acquire additional skills  or  to\r\n\r\npolish  up  their  skills, and the  Bonus  courses\r\n\r\nwhich,  on  successful completion, will entitle  a\r\n\r\nteacher  to  some sort of a bonus  for  a  certain\r\n\r\nperiod. I would like to know from the Minister the\r\n\r\nnumber of courses which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  conducted  last year, and  whether  such  new\r\n\r\ncourses will be conducted this year as well as next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Bonus courses, I believe my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Member  for  Telok  Blangah,   had\r\n\r\noccasion to seek clarification from the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  for  Education  as to whether  such  courses\r\n\r\nwould  be organised more frequently to enable  more\r\n\r\nteachers  to participate. I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\ncare to make some observations on these points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Minister like to reply to\r\n\r\nsome of the points first?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Yes.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  I am quite taken  up  with  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion from the Member for Telok Blangah  about\r\n\r\na loan scheme to help needy pupils. We can consider\r\n\r\nthat.  However, I cannot agree with  him  that  the\r\n\r\ncost of education in Singapore is high. I would say\r\n\r\nthat  in  this respect we are in a better  position\r\n\r\nthan  most countries because we have the facilities\r\n\r\nto allow everyone to have an education. Whenever  a\r\n\r\ncase of real hardship can be made, aid is given.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  management committees are now seriously\r\n\r\nconsidering the possibility of giving free  lunches\r\n\r\nto  very  poor  pupils who have to attend  workshop\r\n\r\nsessions in the evenings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's other observation\r\n\r\nthat  an  added burden is imposed on poor students,\r\n\r\nby  their  having to supply their own uniforms  for\r\n\r\nschool bands and other extra-curricular activities,\r\n\r\neither he or I have been misinformed. As far as the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the Ministry of Education is concerned,\r\n\r\nall  uniforms  for uniformed groups and  bands  are\r\n\r\nsupplied  free. Only in certain cases are  students\r\n\r\nasked  to buy their own shoes. But here again,  the\r\n\r\npoor  students are aided, as shoes are  bought  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the heavy load on the students, I\r\n\r\nheartily  agree with the Member for Telok  Blangah\r\n\r\nthat education should not be a chore. I hate to see\r\n\r\nour  school children going to school with tears  in\r\n\r\ntheir eyes. A directive has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalready been given and steps have been taken to see\r\n\r\nthat,  as far as possible, learning should be  made\r\n\r\nenjoyable  for  our children. In fact,  if  Members\r\n\r\nwere to take time off just to drop in at one of the\r\n\r\nlarge  number of our primary schools and watch  the\r\n\r\nnew  integrated  syllabus being  implemented,  they\r\n\r\nwill  know  what  I  mean when  they  see  children\r\n\r\nlearning   their   lessons  happily   without   any\r\n\r\ninhibitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, in this respect, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  is re-examining its priorities  to  find\r\n\r\nout  what its objectives should be. In fact, during\r\n\r\nthe  last  few  years, we have been so  engaged  in\r\n\r\nnation-building  that many other  Ministries  have,\r\n\r\nshall  I  say,  imposed their requirements  on  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education. We want them to  be  strong\r\n\r\nand  healthy. We want them to keep Singapore  clean\r\n\r\nand  green.  While  these and many  other  national\r\n\r\ncampaigns,  in which we are all engaged,  are  very\r\n\r\ngood  for us, we must at the same time realise that\r\n\r\nthe schoolboys and girls have limited time at their\r\n\r\ndisposal. Their capacity to do the many things they\r\n\r\nare  now  asked  to  do  is  limited  by  the  time\r\n\r\navailable.  We are examining and re-examining  this\r\n\r\naspect  to establish the order of priority so  that\r\n\r\nfirst  things come first instead of wanting  to  do\r\n\r\ntoo  many things at one time. I can assure  Members\r\n\r\nthat this is foremost in my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has made a suggestion\r\n\r\nthat in order to really succeed in our objective to\r\n\r\nmake  our citizens bi-lingual or multi-lingual,  we\r\n\r\nshould  extend the primary school period  from  six\r\n\r\nyears  to seven years. It can be done, but it  will\r\n\r\ncost  a  lot of money. I think it is reasonable  to\r\n\r\nassume  that, with an additional year and with  the\r\n\r\nproper method of teaching, we will be able to  make\r\n\r\nbi-linguists  of  our students. At  the  moment  my\r\n\r\nMinistry is examining the possibility, with the two\r\n\r\nsemester  system,  of  giving special  coaching  to\r\n\r\nstudents  who  are weak in the second language  for\r\n\r\nsix  months or a year. This should enable a student\r\n\r\nfrom  any  stream  on  completion  of  his  primary\r\n\r\neducation to be in a position to choose any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlanguage  stream for his secondary  education.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  students in Chinese primary schools  who\r\n\r\ntake  English  as  a second language  may,  in  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  institution,  elect  to  continue  their\r\n\r\nsecondary  school education in English or  Chinese,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  the same with the Malay and the  Tamil\r\n\r\nstreams.  If  we  are  able to use  modern  methods\r\n\r\nappropriate to our environment, we may reach such a\r\n\r\nstage when transference from one language stream to\r\n\r\nanother  will  present no problem for the  student.\r\n\r\nOnce that is achieved, I think we can consider that\r\n\r\nour  schools  are  truly  integrated,  because  the\r\n\r\nbarrier  to  integration among some of  the  school\r\n\r\nchildren is largely one of language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to aid for rural schools, I think the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya Lebar is misinformed.  There  has\r\n\r\nbeen no change in the policy of a dollar-for-dollar\r\n\r\ngrant  to  rural  aided schools.  Where  they  find\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in getting aid, or where  there  is  no\r\n\r\nencouragement  given to continue  the  aid,  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause the school may be in a resettlement or in a\r\n\r\nredeveloped  area. It would then be  advisable  for\r\n\r\nthe management committee and for Government not  to\r\n\r\nthrow  away  good money, because the  school  would\r\n\r\nhave to be shifted very soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of relief teachers raised by the\r\n\r\nMember for Punggol, I think the Member for Moulmein\r\n\r\nhas  replied  very clearly in his  press  interview\r\n\r\nthis  morning with regard to the position of relief\r\n\r\nteachers.  This interview was published in  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  local  dailies.  I agree  with  him  that  the\r\n\r\nposition will improve when the 800 or so final year\r\n\r\nstudents of the Teachers' Training College have sat\r\n\r\nfor  and  passed  their examinations.  One  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  why  the  post of Teacher-in-Training  has\r\n\r\nbeen  abolished  is  to keep up with  international\r\n\r\npractice. It has been found by experts - not by  me\r\n\r\n- that part-time training is not suitable. Teachers\r\n\r\nshould be trained full-time. Of course, there is no\r\n\r\nquestion of doubt that, wherever possible,  T.T.C.-trained  graduates  will  be  recruited  as  relief\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member's question whether we should give\r\n\r\njobs  to  T.T.C, graduates  in  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation, in reply I will instead ask him  whether\r\n\r\nwe   can  guarantee  jobs  for  graduates  of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore, the Singapore Polytechnic,\r\n\r\nNgee  Ann  College, or any other  institutions  for\r\n\r\nthat matter. This is something which nobody can do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol also wants to know how many\r\n\r\nin-service  courses were conducted  last  year  and\r\n\r\nwhether  we  will continue to run these  in-service\r\n\r\ncourses.  To  the second part of the  question,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  will continue to run them  because  it\r\n\r\nmeans  upgrading the skills of teachers. As regards\r\n\r\nthe   number  of  in-service  courses  which   were\r\n\r\nconducted last year, may I suggest that since  this\r\n\r\nis  a  matter  of  detail, the  Member  puts  in  a\r\n\r\nquestion for Question Time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really very surprised to learn from him - and\r\n\r\nI  hope it is not true -that in-service courses  to\r\n\r\nupgrade skills would only be popular because  there\r\n\r\nis  bonus as an incentive. At least he has  implied\r\n\r\nthat.  However,  I would like to believe  that  the\r\n\r\n20,000  teachers that we have in the service would,\r\n\r\nof their own accord, improve themselves rather than\r\n\r\ndepend on bonus as an incentive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to make\r\n\r\nsome  clarification. First of all, with  regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's  reply on the  question  of  relief\r\n\r\nteachers,  I  am well aware of the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Moulmein  has said  something  to  the\r\n\r\npress.  But  the  Minister  for  Education  totally\r\n\r\nmissed  my  point. I said that some of  the  relief\r\n\r\nteachers,   graduates   and   non-graduates,    are\r\n\r\nadequately qualified, and I wanted to know  whether\r\n\r\nthey can be absorbed into the Education Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of in-service training courses,\r\n\r\nthe  scheme with bonus payment was started  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education. I think  the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  for  Education can bear me  out  that  if  a\r\n\r\nteacher  successfully completes  a  bonus  training\r\n\r\ncourse, he is entitled to a bonus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  believe this was one of the incentives  given  to\r\n\r\nteachers  because  of  the many  grouses  they  had,\r\n\r\nbefore the restructuring of their salary scales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Of course, Mr Speaker, Sir, relief\r\n\r\nteachers  who are capable and efficient always  have\r\n\r\nthe opportunity of being absorbed into the Education\r\n\r\nService.

There\r\n\r\nis no fear that they would not be absorbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards bonus for in-service training courses,\r\n\r\nwe  started  it as an incentive. But, as  I  say,  I\r\n\r\nwould hate to think that it is only incentives which\r\n\r\nmotivate  our teachers to attend in-service training\r\n\r\ncourses.  We  will  continue  conducting  in-service\r\n\r\ncourses  for  upgrading the skills of our  teachers.\r\n\r\nWhile  it  is  an incentive, I hope  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nsecondary  motivation for teachers to  attend  these\r\n\r\ncourses, and not the primary consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, whether or not this is a\r\n\r\nprimary  or  secondary motivation,  I  am  not  less\r\n\r\nconcerned  with the question of monetary inducements\r\n\r\nthat are forthcoming under such a scheme. What I  am\r\n\r\nmore concerned is whether the Ministry is continuing\r\n\r\nto run these in-service training courses and, if so,\r\n\r\nhow  many? Or is the Ministry of Education going  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  running these so-called bonus  courses?  I\r\n\r\nfor  one  would like to see that when  our  teachers\r\n\r\nattend in-service training courses or bonus courses,\r\n\r\nthey  do not go in with the idea of getting  one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  extra  increments, but  because  they  want  to\r\n\r\npolish up or upgrade their skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish to make my contribution on a point arising  out\r\n\r\nof the Minister's reply. With regard to the Member's\r\n\r\nremarks that teachers should be motivated other than\r\n\r\nmonetary  reasons when taking up in-service courses,\r\n\r\nI  would like to tell him that normally teachers, on\r\n\r\ntheir  own accord and in the interest of the service\r\n\r\nand  career,  take  up  extra  courses  without  any\r\n\r\nexpectation of bonuses, and so on. But this  is  the\r\n\r\ncase  only with courses which are related  to  their\r\n\r\nown interest and their own liking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often because of the major shifts in the\r\n\r\neducational  system in the last few years,  teachers\r\n\r\nsometimes are asked to do jobs contrary to their own\r\n\r\naptitudes and interests. Sometimes it helps  to  pay\r\n\r\nbonuses for attending these courses, as the Ministry\r\n\r\nitself  has  recognised. Therefore,  while  agreeing\r\n\r\nwith  the Minister that the main motivation must  be\r\n\r\nfor  the  love  of  it, there is  no  harm  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  increase the number of  courses  where\r\n\r\nbonus payments are made. Therefore, this question of\r\n\r\nmotivation  for  the wrong purposes  should  not  be\r\n\r\ngiven too much prominence.

I am also grateful that he has  clarified\r\n\r\nthe points I have raised just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I am glad to see that the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  is  now able to answer all  queries  with\r\n\r\nease  and in a calm manner. I hope he will have  the\r\n\r\nsame confidence when we come to the next amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years our education system has\r\n\r\nbeen  undergoing  tremendous  changes.  Besides  the\r\n\r\nmajor   change   from  academic-bias  education   to\r\n\r\ntechnical-bias  education,  there  are  many   other\r\n\r\nchanges.  However, I am sorry to say  that  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  changes are indecisive in nature, while  some\r\n\r\nothers  are  dependent on the change  of  Ministers.\r\n\r\nWhether  the changes are all for the good,  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  wait for history to tell. Because  of  the\r\n\r\nspeed  of the changes, sometimes even people in  the\r\n\r\neducational circles feel at a loss. Thus,  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether adequate and prudent consideration had  been\r\n\r\ngiven  before the changes were made. For example,  a\r\n\r\nfew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nyears ago, it is required to use English in teaching\r\n\r\nMathematics and Science in Chinese schools, and  the\r\n\r\nteaching of History, Geography and Civics in Chinese\r\n\r\nin  the  English schools, and so on. However, before\r\n\r\nlong  the  directive  is not  rigidly  enforced  and\r\n\r\nprincipals  are given the discretion to  decide.  At\r\n\r\nthe  moment,  it  is not certain  in  what  language\r\n\r\ntextbooks are to be used for Mathematics and Science\r\n\r\nin  Chinese secondary schools. The reason given  for\r\n\r\nthe   abolition   of  geography   and   history   as\r\n\r\nexamination subjects for the combined primary school\r\n\r\nleaving examination is \"to raise the interest of the\r\n\r\nstudents in these subjects so that the students  may\r\n\r\nnot  have to learn by rote for the examination. Thus\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  will  be better  able  to  use  their\r\n\r\nteaching methods freely to obtain greater effect  in\r\n\r\norder to achieve the aims of education as expected.\"\r\n\r\nThis  was  the  reply  given to the  Chinese  Middle\r\n\r\nSchool  Teachers' Union by the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nand  it was published on 1st March this year in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  newspapers. If that is the  case,  why  not\r\n\r\nabolish   the   combined  primary   school   leaving\r\n\r\nexamination? Why not let us do away with  all  this,\r\n\r\nso  that  teachers  may  be able  to  effect  better\r\n\r\nteaching  methods  to achieve the expected  aims  of\r\n\r\neducation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the use of so-called \"wordless\r\n\r\nnew  syllabus\".  It may be all right to  experienced\r\n\r\nteachers  and  bright students. But if the  teachers\r\n\r\nare  without  any  experience  and  the  pupils  are\r\n\r\nbackward,  then  it will amount to nothing,  whether\r\n\r\nthe  students are attending school or  not.  I  have\r\n\r\ncome  across  certain  pupils who,  after  attending\r\n\r\nprimary school for two years, are still not able  to\r\n\r\nwrite  their  own names. Sir, I am  not  being  very\r\n\r\narchaic  and  I am not against educational  reforms,\r\n\r\nbut  the question is whether these reforms are  good\r\n\r\nfor our education. Here, I would like to suggest  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister that before the implementation of  any\r\n\r\nchange  in the education system or policy, we should\r\n\r\nconsider  the views and opinions of all  the  people\r\n\r\nconcerned. We should not merely go by the reports of\r\n\r\nexperts  or  the  liking of some.  In  case  of  any\r\n\r\nfailure of the reformation, the losers will always\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  our  innocent students. It will also  adversely\r\n\r\naffect  the quality and interest of our  nation  in\r\n\r\nthe long run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me touch on the question of the teaching\r\n\r\nof  second  language in Chinese schools. All  along\r\n\r\nChinese schools have been using English as a second\r\n\r\nlanguage.  They have been striving hard to  promote\r\n\r\nthe  learning of English by increasing the sessions\r\n\r\nor  by  other means. Some schools even  go  to  the\r\n\r\nextent of providing additional English teachers out\r\n\r\nof  their  own funds to teach the English language.\r\n\r\nHowever,  all  these efforts seem to have  achieved\r\n\r\nnot  much success. Basically, I think it is because\r\n\r\nboth  the  textbooks and the teachers are far  from\r\n\r\nideal.  Generally,  not every  English  teacher  in\r\n\r\nChinese schools is properly trained in the teaching\r\n\r\nof  the second language. There is great mobility of\r\n\r\nsuch   teachers  too.  Some  pre-university   level\r\n\r\nclasses  are  taught  by  teachers  with   only   a\r\n\r\nCambridge  School Certificate. It is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nhave  trained  teachers and to have  new  textbooks\r\n\r\ncompiled  to meet the needs and background  of  our\r\n\r\nlocal   situation  in  order  to  meet  the  actual\r\n\r\nrequirement  for a better standard  of  English  in\r\n\r\nChinese schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise a final question for\r\n\r\nthe Minister's consideration. That is the abolition\r\n\r\nof the post allowance to school Vice-Principals. In\r\n\r\nOctober  last, the Teachers' Unions had reached  an\r\n\r\nagreement  with  the Ministry of Education  on  the\r\n\r\nreadjustment of salary structure. To be  fair,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry should not change the substance and spirit\r\n\r\nof  the  agreement by acting unilaterally. How  can\r\n\r\nthe  post  allowance of Vice-Principals be entirely\r\n\r\nabolished  in the course of the readjustment  after\r\n\r\nit  has been implemented for so many years? I would\r\n\r\nlike the Minister to explain this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\npraiseworthy to note that the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nis   continually  making  efforts  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  education.  The  recent  decision   to\r\n\r\nabolish  examinations in History and  Geography  in\r\n\r\nthe  primary schools is an example of such  effort.\r\n\r\nHowever, this decision has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  questioned in some quarters and the  validity\r\n\r\nof some of the criticisms merits close attention by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for abolishing these examinations\r\n\r\nseems to be the heavy learning load on children and\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of  time  or the teacher  to  cover  the\r\n\r\nsyllabus for these subjects. The pressure  of  time\r\n\r\nin  the  learning  of  these  subjects  has  caused\r\n\r\nstudents to commit to memory a mass of facts  which\r\n\r\nhave no meaning to them, who only present them  out\r\n\r\nof context. With History and Geography becoming non-examination  subjects, it is  hoped  that  children\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to learn at their own leisure,  thus\r\n\r\nensuring  a comprehensive grasp of the subjects  in\r\n\r\ntheir  totality so that learning becomes meaningful\r\n\r\nand directional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the mere abolition of examinations on\r\n\r\nthese  subjects  may  not  help  to  achieve   this\r\n\r\nobjective.  Children in the Primary School  Leaving\r\n\r\nExamination  classes  tend to  be  over-examination\r\n\r\nconscious,  and  may  not  pay  due  attention  and\r\n\r\ninterest to non-examination subjects. This frame of\r\n\r\nmind  applies  with  equal truth  to  the  teachers\r\n\r\nteaching  in  these classes. So it may  perhaps  be\r\n\r\nmore  feasible  to  revise  the  syllabi  of  these\r\n\r\nsubjects by reducing their content so that they  do\r\n\r\nnot  impose  a burden upon the children's  capacity\r\n\r\nfor  learning. However, if it is intended to  carry\r\n\r\nthrough  with the decision to suspend examinations,\r\n\r\nthen  this should be confined only to the  P.S.L.E.\r\n\r\nclasses.  Examinations  in  these  subjects  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  in  the lower standards  in  which  these\r\n\r\nsubjects are taught. An overall suspension of these\r\n\r\nexaminations may lead to its total neglect  in  the\r\n\r\nother extreme and defeat the very purpose for which\r\n\r\nit is intended to achieve. I think the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  will agree with me that  history  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant subject in our school curriculum  for  it\r\n\r\nrecords  the events of a nation's past. If students\r\n\r\ndo  not know the events of our nation's past,  then\r\n\r\nthere  is  hardly  any chance to build  a  nation's\r\n\r\nfuture. And more so, our future generation will not\r\n\r\nbe  able to know, for instance, who is the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education  in the year 1972!  Whether  or  not\r\n\r\nthere is merit in abolishing examinations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  history,  I  strongly urge  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  to seriously consider it before  taking\r\n\r\nsteps to implement this policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the\r\n\r\nlast  Budget session, I touched on the  integrated\r\n\r\nschool  system. I regret that even now  there  are\r\n\r\nvery  few  schools that can be truly  said  to  be\r\n\r\nintegrated    schools.   Many   schools    display\r\n\r\nsignboards to say that they are integrated schools\r\n\r\nbut,  in  fact,  they  are  completely  segregated\r\n\r\nschools.   Some  of  these  Government  integrated\r\n\r\nschools  are  separated by language,  the  English\r\n\r\nstream  occupying one half of the  building  while\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese stream occupies the other half.  Even\r\n\r\nin  the  field  of  sports, the  two  streams  are\r\n\r\nseparated.  It  is further disappointing  to  note\r\n\r\nthat  segregation  exists in  the  English  stream\r\n\r\nwhere  the students are separated by race. Chinese\r\n\r\nstudents are put in different classes while  Tamil\r\n\r\nand  Malay students are put together in one class.\r\n\r\nThe  excuse for this is second language. I  wonder\r\n\r\nhow  the second language can be used as an  excuse\r\n\r\nfor  these  students  to be segregated  throughout\r\n\r\ntheir  secondary school career,  when  it  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention and policy to integrate the\r\n\r\npeople of different races. This is a very pressing\r\n\r\nproblem.  May I ask the Minister for Education  to\r\n\r\nlook  into this matter as soon as possible  before\r\n\r\nfurther damage is done in our schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commendable on, the part of the Government\r\n\r\nto  lay  emphasis on bilingualism, which has  been\r\n\r\nlong overdue. It is true that bi-lingualism or bi-lingualism can make our citizens more tolerant and\r\n\r\nto  achieve a better understanding of each other's\r\n\r\ncultures and traditions. But I wonder if  we  have\r\n\r\nsufficient teachers who are themselves bi-lingual.\r\n\r\nMay  I suggest that emphasis be laid on persuading\r\n\r\nteachers  to  be  bi-lingual  themselves.  It   is\r\n\r\nthrough their understanding of the complexities or\r\n\r\nproblems  faced by the other races that they  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to impart their views of tolerance on the\r\n\r\nyounger generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt  present,  we  find teachers  educated  in  one\r\n\r\nmedium only and, therefore, conversant only in one\r\n\r\nlanguage,  like living in cocoons. These  teachers\r\n\r\nare  quite often insulted from ignorance of  their\r\n\r\nown  problems, customs, traditions. The  aesthetic\r\n\r\nqualities found in a knowledge of a language other\r\n\r\nthan  their  own  are  not much  of  an  asset  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, an option was\r\n\r\ngiven  to the various schools to teach Mathematics\r\n\r\nand  Science in the language they prefer,  largely\r\n\r\nbecause  there  was insufficient  staff  to  teach\r\n\r\nthese  subjects  in  English in  a  Chinese-medium\r\n\r\nschool, and as a result we found that the standard\r\n\r\nof Mathematics and Science began to fall. About  a\r\n\r\nyear  ago, I announced that when sufficient  staff\r\n\r\nhas  been  trained in the T.T.C, and are available\r\n\r\nto  teach Mathematics and Science, we will make it\r\n\r\ncompulsory to teach these two subjects in  English\r\n\r\nin Chinese schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid the Member for Jurong really\r\n\r\nmade  a  wild and sweeping statement when he  said\r\n\r\nthat many children who have been in school for two\r\n\r\nyears  cannot write their names. I know there  are\r\n\r\nalways  black  sheep to be found  in  a  group  of\r\n\r\npeople  and  probably we also have  our  share  of\r\n\r\nretarded  children among the young ones.  However,\r\n\r\nif  it  is really true that these students  cannot\r\n\r\nwrite their names after two years of schooling,  I\r\n\r\nthink  what they need is not so much a teacher  or\r\n\r\nhelp  from  the Education Ministry, but help  from\r\n\r\nthe  psychologists. However, I am sure  that  such\r\n\r\ncases are, few and far between, and if they should\r\n\r\ncome  to  the notice of the Member for  Jurong,  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask him to appeal to the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nfor assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of incorporating the\r\n\r\nallowance  of  the  Vice-Principal  into  the  new\r\n\r\nsalary scale, it may also interest and please  him\r\n\r\nto  know  that we have written to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  on  this subject. This was a point  which\r\n\r\nwas  probably overlooked by both the Union and the\r\n\r\nMinistry during the negotiations. Anyway,  we  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  rectify this. The final decision  will\r\n\r\nhave to depend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nupon  the Ministry of Finance, though I can assure\r\n\r\nhim  that  the Ministry of Education will advocate\r\n\r\nthe  incorporation of this allowance,  because  we\r\n\r\nthink that there is a case to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad that the Member for Bras Basah has\r\n\r\nrealised, or agreed, that it will be a good  thing\r\n\r\nto  do  away  with  examinations  in  History  and\r\n\r\nGeography  in the P.S.L.E. If this is so,  and  if\r\n\r\nhis  own reasoning has led him to this conclusion,\r\n\r\nI  think  it  will lead him to the  fact  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  abolish  this examination in  the  primary\r\n\r\nschools.  Therefore, I cannot understand  why,  on\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand, he considers that it is advisable.\r\n\r\nin  order  to  make the students less examination-orientated,  to abolish the P.S.L.E, examination,\r\n\r\nbut  on  the  other  hand  to  continue  with  the\r\n\r\nexamination  of  these  subjects  in  the  primary\r\n\r\nschools at the lower levels. Anyway, I am  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion,  though I am not a professional educator,\r\n\r\nthat  it  is no use talking about the significance\r\n\r\nof  History  or  the importance of  Geography,  if\r\n\r\nchildren do not understand what they read. I think\r\n\r\nour  first  priority should be to teach and  allow\r\n\r\nchildren  to  get a firm grasp of the language  or\r\n\r\nlanguages. That is the reason why I thought, after\r\n\r\nconsulting professional educators, that we  should\r\n\r\ntake  History and Geography as part of a  language\r\n\r\nlesson.  Although there is no examination for  the\r\n\r\ntwo  subjects, part of the information  and  facts\r\n\r\nwhich  they  read and gather from the  History  or\r\n\r\nGeography  textbooks would be required  when  they\r\n\r\nsit  for  their language examinations. This  would\r\n\r\nalso   allow   the   teachers  more   freedom   in\r\n\r\napproaching  the  subject  and  to  make  it  more\r\n\r\ninteresting. So it is not a question of  free-for-all  for  the  teachers to do what they  like  and\r\n\r\nignore  the subjects. But we hope that, by  making\r\n\r\nboth   History   and   Geography   non-examination\r\n\r\nsubjects, they would be made more interesting  and\r\n\r\nmore pleasant for the child to learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us, including the Member for Anson,\r\n\r\nwould  like to see actual integration taking place\r\n\r\nin  the  schools. But I think it is  too  much  to\r\n\r\nexpect  a  miracle to be performed in five  years.\r\n\r\nand to see all our people mingling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfreely.  The  barrier to integration lies  in  the\r\n\r\nability  to  communicate in a common language.  We\r\n\r\nwant  to  integrate  them by  making  them  multi-lingual.  Therefore, it is not true  to  say  that\r\n\r\ninstead  of encouraging integration, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nis  discouraging it by putting pupils of different\r\n\r\nraces into different classes, i.e., the Tamil  and\r\n\r\nMalay  students are in one class and  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nstudents in the other classes - students are  only\r\n\r\nput  in  the  same class when they take  a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage.  For  instance, if the Tamil  and  Malay\r\n\r\nstudents are studying either Tamil or Malay, then,\r\n\r\nwherever possible, we put them in the same  class.\r\n\r\nI  think all the teachers and principals are aware\r\n\r\nof  this integration policy. So I do not think the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson has got the right  information.\r\n\r\nThere  is no segregation in the way that he  seems\r\n\r\nto think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, I think I have covered most of\r\n\r\nthe  points.

However, there  is\r\n\r\none point which he has overlooked, and that is the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  raising the standard of  English  in\r\n\r\nChinese schools. I would like to hear his views on\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI would like to express the hope that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education  will enlighten us on  the  present\r\n\r\npolicy  of the dollar-for-dollar grant-in-aid  for\r\n\r\naided   schools  in  the  rural  areas.   I   have\r\n\r\ndiscovered that several schools in the rural areas\r\n\r\nhave  to rebuild their schools, but they have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able to obtain this dollar-for-dollar  grant\r\n\r\nin  aid or any capital grant. Now, if the Board of\r\n\r\nDirectors  of the school or the school authorities\r\n\r\ndo  not  understand the procedure in applying  for\r\n\r\nthis  dollar  for  dollar grant-in-aid,  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Minister will consider  giving  more\r\n\r\ninformation to such people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  comment  on a particular point  on  the  post-allowance for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVice-Principals which the Minister, in his reply,\r\n\r\nhad  left  out.

I would like to\r\n\r\ntell  him  that  that  is  not  so, because  the\r\n\r\nprinciples enunciated in the agreement  are  very\r\n\r\nclearly  spelt  out and they cover  them.  May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that someone in the Finance Ministry  has\r\n\r\nmessed it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I will not quarrel with the\r\n\r\nMember  for Moulmein about that. Coming first  to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Paya Lebar, let me assure him that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  change in the policy of  giving  a\r\n\r\ndollar-for-dollar grant to aided  schools.  Where\r\n\r\nhe has difficulty. I would say that it is largely\r\n\r\nbecause  the  management committee  has  probably\r\n\r\nexperienced  difficulty in raising the  requisite\r\n\r\namount, which they will have to raise in order to\r\n\r\ncontinue the projects which they have in hand. Or\r\n\r\nit  could  be  that, as I have said earlier,  the\r\n\r\nschool  is  likely to he resettled, or  that  the\r\n\r\narea is marked for further development so that it\r\n\r\nwould   be  wise  not  to  spend  further   money\r\n\r\nrebuilding  and repairing the school  because  it\r\n\r\nwould have to be demolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the Member for Jurong on how\r\n\r\nto  improve the teaching of a second language, we\r\n\r\nare trying to supplement or give further sessions\r\n\r\nin  English as second language by opening classes\r\n\r\nin  the afternoons, so that those who really need\r\n\r\nit  will have the opportunity to spend more  time\r\n\r\non  the study of the language. But here again,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  depends on whether  we  can  evolve  a\r\n\r\nsuitable  system  to teach English  as  a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage,  or  Chinese as a second  language  for\r\n\r\nthat matter because of the special content of our\r\n\r\nsociety.  This  is where professionals  like  the\r\n\r\nMembers  for  Jurong and Paya Lebar can  help  if\r\n\r\nthey  will just get their unions to consider what\r\n\r\nis   the   best   approach  under   the   special\r\n\r\ncircumstances. Anyway, the Research  Officers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Education are exercising  their\r\n\r\nminds on this matter and possibly we may come  up\r\n\r\nwith a new syllabus and new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmethods. It could be something of the type  which\r\n\r\nwas  considered  a great success in  America  and\r\n\r\nwhich is now telecast over our T.V. But I do  not\r\n\r\nconsider  this  method to be exactly  appropriate\r\n\r\nhere,  because it deals with people  who  already\r\n\r\nknow  how to speak English, and moreover it deals\r\n\r\nwith adults. Anyway, this is food for thought for\r\n\r\nthe professionals in the Ministry of Education. I\r\n\r\nhope   they  will  be  able  to  come   to   some\r\n\r\nconclusions,  so  that we  can  have  a  syllabus\r\n\r\nappropriate to our surroundings arid so  make  it\r\n\r\neasier for our students to acquire a knowledge of\r\n\r\nEnglish,  Malay.  Chinese or Tamil  as  a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage without too much sweat;  though  in  the\r\n\r\nend  it  comes  to sweating on the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents before they can grasp a command  of  the\r\n\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, perhaps when I moved the\r\n\r\namendment  and spoke on the expenses of  uniforms\r\n\r\nfor  students in the uniformed groups. I did  not\r\n\r\nmake  myself  clear. If I remember  correct, the\r\n\r\nMinister  mentioned that all  such  uniforms  are\r\n\r\nprovided  free And he has also said  that  I  was\r\n\r\nperhaps  misinformed. I want a clarification,  to\r\n\r\nmake  clear  on  what I have said,  and  also  to\r\n\r\nlisten  to the Minister's further views  on  free\r\n\r\nuniforms,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am correctly informed, uniforms are\r\n\r\nprovided  free in the case of members  in  N.C.C.\r\n\r\nthat is, the National Cadet Corps of the Army and\r\n\r\nthe  Police.  However, the  uniformed  groups  in\r\n\r\nschools  are not confined to these two categories\r\n\r\nalone.  There  are  other uniformed  groups, for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the Boy Scouts, the Girl  Guides,  the\r\n\r\nRed  Cross,  the  Boys' Brigade, the  St.  John's\r\n\r\nAmbulance Brigade and, most important of all, the\r\n\r\nschool   bands   which  we  are  very   keen   on\r\n\r\nadvocating.  As I have said earlier on,  I  speak\r\n\r\nwith  some  experience  as  I  have  children  in\r\n\r\nschools. I have said that there are many  schools\r\n\r\nwhich provide these uniforms free of charge, on a\r\n\r\nloan  basis. However, there are also some schools\r\n\r\nwhere  the  children  have to  buy  the  uniforms\r\n\r\nthemselves.  It  is  all  right  for  me  to  buy\r\n\r\nuniforms for my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren,  but  there are some  people  who  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  buy  them. This is where  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinister said that the school management committees\r\n\r\nare  even looking into the possibility of providing\r\n\r\nfree  lunches if students have to stay  behind  for\r\n\r\ntechnical  education.  This  is  a  welcome   move.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  we can extend this privilege by  providing\r\n\r\nfree  uniforms  so that we do not confine  children\r\n\r\nfrom  the lower income group to the N.C.C, of  the\r\n\r\nPolice or the Army. If they have talent and if they\r\n\r\nare  interested, they can join the school hand.  It\r\n\r\nis exorbitant to buy uniforms, especially those for\r\n\r\nthe school band. I know this from experience. Can I\r\n\r\nhave the Minister's clarification on this issue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if school bands\r\n\r\nare  encouraged by the schools and form part of the\r\n\r\nschool   curriculum,  then  uniforms  are  provided\r\n\r\ncompletely  free.  I would not know  whether  Scout\r\n\r\nuniforms  are  given free, but I know  for  certain\r\n\r\nthat  needy students who join the Boys' Brigade  or\r\n\r\nBoy Scouts are given free uniforms. Anyway, all the\r\n\r\nN.C.C, uniforms are given completely free. In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  Scouts group, where the Troop belongs  to\r\n\r\nthe school, free uniforms are probably provided. If\r\n\r\nit  is  not free, then it is a remnant of  the  old\r\n\r\ncustom.   Whether  or  not  the  school  management\r\n\r\ncommittees  will provide free uniforms,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow.  As  far  as  the Ministry  of  Education  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, we have provided free uniforms  for  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  categories of uniformed groups  which  I\r\n\r\nhave  stated.  Much as we like,  I  will  not  make\r\n\r\npromises  just now, because finance is not  in  the\r\n\r\nhands of the Ministry of Education. It has to  come\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  There  are  many\r\n\r\naspects  of  the problem which must be looked  into\r\n\r\nbefore  we  can  provide  free  uniforms  for   the\r\n\r\nuniformed  groups,  like  the  Boys'  Brigade,  Boy\r\n\r\nScouts or the Red Cross.

However, let me briefly touch on some\r\n\r\nproblems   of   education  which   require   urgent\r\n\r\nattention.  My  colleagues and I, who  are  in  the\r\n\r\nteaching  profession, are of the opinion  that  the\r\n\r\nnumerous  educational  seminars  organised  by  the\r\n\r\nspecialist  inspectors were not very well  managed.\r\n\r\nThere were too many. In the first term of this year\r\n\r\nalone  there  were seminars for Primary  I  and  II\r\n\r\nrevised  syllabus for Mathematics, the Primary  III\r\n\r\nand IV revised syllabus for Physical Education, the\r\n\r\nPrimary III and IV revised syllabus for Music, etc.\r\n\r\nAll  these so-called seminars were of two or  three\r\n\r\nhours' duration only. In these seminars, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecialist inspectors merely took out their  notes\r\n\r\nand  rattled them off, and that was the end of it.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  teachers who had  to  attend  these\r\n\r\nseminars, especially those who come from the rural\r\n\r\nareas are experiencing some difficulties. As  soon\r\n\r\nas  their  schools were dismissed at  about  12.50\r\n\r\np.m., they had to take a quick lunch, rush off  to\r\n\r\ncatch a bus and should within one and a half hours\r\n\r\nreach  their destination. The seminars would begin\r\n\r\nat  2.30  p.m. They were in such great haste  that\r\n\r\nwhen  they  reached  their destination  they  were\r\n\r\npanting  like dogs. The seminars were  of  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  hours'  duration.  I  doubt  whether  these\r\n\r\nseminars  will  help the teachers in familiarising\r\n\r\nthemselves  with  the  new  teaching  methods  and\r\n\r\nwhether  any  real  objectives  can  be  achieved.\r\n\r\nMoreover, most of the primary school teachers  are\r\n\r\nnot  specialist teachers. They should be  able  to\r\n\r\nteach  all subjects. The subjects taught  by  them\r\n\r\nare not the same every year. Sometimes before they\r\n\r\nare  conversant  with a certain subject  they  are\r\n\r\nasked  to  attend  a seminar. We can  imagine  the\r\n\r\noutcome  of such a seminar. As for those  teachers\r\n\r\nwho  come  from the small schools,  they  have  to\r\n\r\nteach   many   subjects  in   different   classes.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is very likely that  they  will  be\r\n\r\nasked  to  attend  seminars on  various  subjects.\r\n\r\nUnder  such  circumstances, it is not possible  to\r\n\r\nexpect these teachers to perform their duties well\r\n\r\nand to benefit from such seminars. Hence, the main\r\n\r\nobjective of the seminars was lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no limit to learning.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the  duty  of a teacher  to  keep  himself\r\n\r\nabreast  of  the  latest trend in  his  particular\r\n\r\nfield. He must keep himself informed of the latest\r\n\r\nknowledge.  The  theory  of  education  cannot  be\r\n\r\nstudied  in two or three hours, A teacher  has  to\r\n\r\nspend  a  lot  of  time studying  the  methods  of\r\n\r\nteaching.  Whether or not the methods of  teaching\r\n\r\nare suitable will depend on the specific school in\r\n\r\nwhich  he  teaches. I am of the opinion  that  the\r\n\r\nseminars  should be well planned. They  should  be\r\n\r\nconducted during the long vacation period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  should  last  at  least  a  few  days.   The\r\n\r\ndiscussions should be held in a systematic manner.\r\n\r\nThe  results  of  the discussions,  including  the\r\n\r\nteachers' reactions, should be considered, and any\r\n\r\nproposals made should be implemented. It  is  only\r\n\r\nlogical  to do so. It is impossible to  discuss  a\r\n\r\nsubject  within  three hours at a seminar.  To  my\r\n\r\nmind this is only a waste of time and effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me touch on a different problem which\r\n\r\nhas  become quite common in Singapore,  but  which\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  solved.  I  am  referring  to  the\r\n\r\nallegations  of  members  of  the  public  against\r\n\r\npublic  officers. We live in a democratic  country\r\n\r\nand  the  people have every right to  censure  any\r\n\r\ncorrupt  officials  or  to make  any  constructive\r\n\r\ncriticism   against   certain   aspects   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy. They are allowed to  exercise\r\n\r\nsuch rights. However, some of the allegations  are\r\n\r\ngroundless  and  are not based on facts.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthem  are  mere  frame-ups. Such  allegations  are\r\n\r\nusually made in the form of anonymous letters.  On\r\n\r\nreceipt  of such letters, the department concerned\r\n\r\nwill  carry out an investigation and if  there  is\r\n\r\nany  truth in the allegation, the officer will  be\r\n\r\npunished.  If  not, then that is the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter.  We  can  imagine the mental  torture  the\r\n\r\nalleged   officer   has   to   undergo   when   an\r\n\r\ninvestigation is being conducted, and  the  effect\r\n\r\nit  might  have  on his reputation.  However,  the\r\n\r\nperson  who  makes  an untruthful  allegation  has\r\n\r\nachieved   his   purpose,   that   is,   malicious\r\n\r\ndefamation  of a certain official, and is  allowed\r\n\r\nto  go unpunished. Such procedures in dealing with\r\n\r\nthe complaints will result in the victimisation of\r\n\r\nthese officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, those in the teaching profession\r\n\r\nare  very  particular about their good name.  When\r\n\r\ndealing  with  such complaints,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation should follow a rational procedure.  Any\r\n\r\nletter  of complaint which does not bear any  real\r\n\r\nnames and addresses should not be dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up, Mr Tay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo not want to talk on the problem of policies.  I\r\n\r\nmerely   want   to  touch  on  the  technique   of\r\n\r\nimplementing  our policies. Our policy  of  multi-lingualism  is a wise and farsighted one  and  has\r\n\r\nwon international acclaim. However, from the views\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  other Backbenchers, it  seems  that\r\n\r\nthey   are   not  entirely  satisfied   with   its\r\n\r\nimplementation, and that something has gone  wrong\r\n\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students are not fluent not only in their\r\n\r\nmother  tongue but also in their second  language.\r\n\r\nThis  might be due to the fact that our Government\r\n\r\nis  more  concerned  about fostering  science  and\r\n\r\ntechnology,  thereby resulting in the  neglect  of\r\n\r\nthe  languages.  Subjects such as  the  humanities\r\n\r\nhave  been  neglected.  A  certain  Chinese  press\r\n\r\nrecently  advertised for translators.  There  were\r\n\r\nabout   20  applicants  and  the  result  of   the\r\n\r\ninterview  was  that  the  applicants   were   not\r\n\r\nproficient  in their second language  or  even  in\r\n\r\ntheir  first  language. And these were  graduates.\r\n\r\nThis shows that there is no proper training in the\r\n\r\nsecond  language. In the Universities,  there  are\r\n\r\ncourses  in  translation. There are also  language\r\n\r\nlaboratories. However, such courses appear  to  be\r\n\r\nmere  frills,  not being put to  good  effect.  By\r\n\r\nthemselves,  they are not adequate  to  train  our\r\n\r\npupils'  ability  in  languages  and  translation,\r\n\r\nThere will be more and more scope for translators,\r\n\r\nas  translation has become a profession. There may\r\n\r\nbe language specialists in the higher institutions\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  fully utilised and as our  language\r\n\r\nteachers have not been given any special training,\r\n\r\nmay  I  suggest  to  the  Minister  to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nspecialist  language  training  course   for   our\r\n\r\nlanguage teachers. We can get the T.T.C, to  make\r\n\r\nuse   of   the   language  laboratories   in   the\r\n\r\nuniversities  to  train  them.  The   T.T.C, can\r\n\r\norganise  training in these labs for our  language\r\n\r\nteachers at all levels and from all streams. There\r\n\r\nare  many language teaching scholars who had  been\r\n\r\ntrained abroad and they have been posted to  teach\r\n\r\nsimple  language  classes, Thus, their  talent  is\r\n\r\nlittle  used.

I think the  kind\r\n\r\nof  behaviour and thinking they have will  have  a\r\n\r\ngreat bearing on our future. Sir, not long ago the\r\n\r\nstudents  in our schools were guilty of  extremism\r\n\r\nin  their  thinking and behaviour which caused  us\r\n\r\nsome  concern,  They were a bit radical  and  this\r\n\r\nlasted  for  some length of time,  and  they  were\r\n\r\ncriticised  by the society at large. However,  now\r\n\r\nthere  has  been a complete change  to  the  other\r\n\r\nextreme.  They have become indulgent  in  pleasure\r\n\r\nseeking and licentiousness, and some of them  even\r\n\r\ntry  to imitate hippies of the West. This has also\r\n\r\ninfected our schools. You can notice it. If we  do\r\n\r\nnot  arrest such trends now, allow it to continue,\r\n\r\nit  will  result  in  our  young  people  becoming\r\n\r\ndecadent and degenerate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then are we going to bring up a rugged\r\n\r\ngeneration? The purpose of having extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities  in  the  schools  is  to  channel  the\r\n\r\nlearning  and energy of our students to the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.  Hence we have civic  subjects  in  our\r\n\r\nschools. How then could our youths have changed? I\r\n\r\nthink  we can deal with this matter under  several\r\n\r\nsubheadings.   Firstly,   the   evil   vogue   and\r\n\r\nenvironment   in   our   society   exert   harmful\r\n\r\ninfluences  over  our  youngsters.  Youngsters  of\r\n\r\nlesser will power will not be able to resist  such\r\n\r\nenticements and trends, Mass media like Radio  and\r\n\r\nT.V, broadcasts,   gramophones,   the    press,\r\n\r\nadvertisements and posters, bookstores and  coffee\r\n\r\nhouses, all exert a kind of degenerating influence\r\n\r\non  our  young  people. On this,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomason  has given his view in the  House  a  few\r\n\r\ndays  ago.  Secondly, the disciplinary control  by\r\n\r\nthe schools has recently been lax on our students.\r\n\r\nMany teachers have sighed with a heavy heart about\r\n\r\nthis. What are the causes? The answer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  be  that the schools do not bother to control\r\n\r\nthe  students, The less you do, the  less  trouble\r\n\r\nyou get, otherwise your good intention may get you\r\n\r\nevil  recompense from the students,  What  is  the\r\n\r\nreason  for  this  situation? It  is  because  the\r\n\r\nschools  are  not given proper authority  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  students. Teachers are  not  given  the\r\n\r\nright  to  mete out corporal punishment. With  the\r\n\r\nsystem  of  automatic  promotion,  persuasion  and\r\n\r\ncharacter  records  will  have  no  avail  on  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  If any corporal punishment  is  to  be\r\n\r\nmeted  out, the school must be prepared  to  brave\r\n\r\nthe  possible  anger of parents because  they  may\r\n\r\nwrite to the Ministry or to the press to complain.\r\n\r\nUnder  such  circumstances, is it any wonder  that\r\n\r\nmost  schools  do not want to get any  credit  hut\r\n\r\nhope   to  avoid  getting  into  trouble  by   not\r\n\r\nexercising  control  over the  students?  Thirdly,\r\n\r\nparents do not exercise their guidance adequately.\r\n\r\nThis  might  be  due  to lack of  time  or  proper\r\n\r\nunderstanding  on their part. Most  of  them  send\r\n\r\ntheir  children  to school in the hope  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  taken  care  of by  the  schools.  Since\r\n\r\nstudents  spend about 5\ufffd  hours in the  school  and\r\n\r\nmost  of the time at home, then if parents do  not\r\n\r\ntake proper care of their children but allow their\r\n\r\nchildren to wander about and to get mixed up  with\r\n\r\nbad  elements, they will be led astray. These  are\r\n\r\nhut  a  few  common causes; there are  many  other\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to produce a rugged and healthy\r\n\r\ngeneration,  which possesses not  only  brawn  hut\r\n\r\nbrain, we must allow the schools to have a settled\r\n\r\nand  peaceful  environment. To achieve  this,  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of discipline in the schools  is  most\r\n\r\nimportant.   At  the  moment,  the   tendency   to\r\n\r\nindulgence, looseness and self-seeking on the part\r\n\r\nof  youths  is still in the incipient stage,  anti\r\n\r\ntherefore it is time we took steps to arrest  such\r\n\r\ntendency.  However, this cannot be done by  merely\r\n\r\nholding a few seminars or talking and lecturing by\r\n\r\nsome experts. It is not a time to sit and talk but\r\n\r\na  time to stand up and act. In this respect,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshoulder its particular responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad\r\n\r\nBackbenchers are not happy with certain aspects of\r\n\r\nour  implementation of policies. As my  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Communications, has said earlier\r\n\r\non,  any  improvement which has been made  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Communications is in a large part  due\r\n\r\nto the dissatisfaction of Backbenchers; that it is\r\n\r\nlargely  due  to the constructive criticisms  that\r\n\r\nimprovements  have been made. In the  same  way  I\r\n\r\nhope that improvements can be made in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education,  partly due to the' criticisms  and\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction of Backbenchers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Delta that because\r\n\r\nof  the introduction of technical education, there\r\n\r\nis   no  likelihood  of  our  neglecting  academic\r\n\r\nstudies at all. Probably his dissatisfaction,  and\r\n\r\nthe dissatisfaction of many other Members, is with\r\n\r\nregard  to the lack of linguistic ability  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents  stemming  largely  from  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nprobably we are expecting too much in too short  a\r\n\r\ntime.  This question of multi-lingualism  and  bi-lingualism  is  a  recent  phenomenon,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsurprised  at his disappointment in finding  that,\r\n\r\nin  answer  to  an advertisement for  translators,\r\n\r\nthere were only 20 applicants who turned out to be\r\n\r\ninadequate for the job. I should think it  is  too\r\n\r\ngeneral  to blame our educational system  for  the\r\n\r\nlack  of proficient translators because if I  were\r\n\r\nan efficient and proficient translator, I can make\r\n\r\na much better living elsewhere rather than being a\r\n\r\ntranslator   and  spending  my  time   translating\r\n\r\ndocuments. The mere fact that there were  only  20\r\n\r\napplicants with inadequate qualifications for  the\r\n\r\npost  or translator does not mean that we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave efficient bi-linguists or multi-linguists  in\r\n\r\nour  midst. They are there, but we expect  to  see\r\n\r\nmore of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, we must realise that today's child\r\n\r\nin   school,  whether  he  be'  in  a  primary  or\r\n\r\nsecondary  school, is expected to learn much  more\r\n\r\nthan what was required in my time. In those days,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst  and foremost, we spent all our time on  one\r\n\r\nlanguage.  There was then not that much  explosion\r\n\r\nof knowledge as today, such that the child now has\r\n\r\nto  divide  his time not only studying  the  great\r\n\r\nmass  of  new knowledge and discoveries that  have\r\n\r\ncome to the fore, but also studying two languages.\r\n\r\nOn  top  of  that, he is also involved  in  extra-curricular activities. This is where we  have  got\r\n\r\nto  be a bit chary anti wary in choosing the  kind\r\n\r\nof  syllabus  that  is  required  to  develop  our\r\n\r\nchildren in an all round manner, so that they will\r\n\r\nbe  technically orientated and will also have  the\r\n\r\nacademic  background to live a fuller and  a  more\r\n\r\ngracious  life.  I  would say that  we  are  in  a\r\n\r\nposition   of  flux  just  now  and  the  Research\r\n\r\nDepartment of the Ministry of Education will  have\r\n\r\nto  spend  more  time in evaluating carefully  the\r\n\r\nkind  of syllabus anti teaching that we have,  and\r\n\r\nthe  kind  of  subjects that are being  taught  in\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to hear that we have what the\r\n\r\nMember for Delta described as linguistic scholars,\r\n\r\nwho  are being underused in Nanyang University and\r\n\r\nhis   offer  of  their  services  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  language  in  the  T.T.C, is   most\r\n\r\nwelcome.  For the information of Members,  we  are\r\n\r\nnot lying idle in the T.T C We are running classes\r\n\r\nin  E,L.II, i.e., English classes for non-English\r\n\r\nmedium  teachers  anti Chinese  classes  for  non-Chinese  medium teachers, to improve their command\r\n\r\nof  anti  skills in the languages. All this  takes\r\n\r\ntime. It does not happen all at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, I do not know what the Member\r\n\r\nfor Jurong actually meant when he said that we can\r\n\r\ndo  something in the way of controlling  the  very\r\n\r\nlax  attitude of the students, and their love  for\r\n\r\nan  easy  life.  Among the points  raised  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Jurong  I would think  that  what  he\r\n\r\nexpects   us  to  do  is  to  return  to  corporal\r\n\r\npunishment  in school. He is an educator  himself,\r\n\r\nbut  from  reports I have gathered, I  would  have\r\n\r\nthought  that  this is a retrograde step.  Anyway,\r\n\r\nthere is sufficient authority\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the school for corporal punishment, if the\r\n\r\ncase   warrants  it.  The  principal  is   already\r\n\r\nempowered, but to allow' each and every teacher to\r\n\r\ninflict  corporal  Punishment  on  a  child  is  a\r\n\r\nretrograde step. From the limited experience  that\r\n\r\nI  have  in the Ministry of Education, I can  well\r\n\r\nimagine the amount of abuse that can come up  from\r\n\r\nthis because among the 20,000 school teachers some\r\n\r\nare  probably not quite conversant with the object\r\n\r\nof  corporal punishment. Probably some of them may\r\n\r\nneed  psychiatric treatment, in the same way  that\r\n\r\npsychiatric treatment may be needed for those  who\r\n\r\nare  unable  to write their names after  being  in\r\n\r\nschool  for two years, as mentioned by the Member.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it will he very dangerous  to  empower\r\n\r\nteachers   in   general  to  administer   corporal\r\n\r\npunishment. There are other solutions. But what  I\r\n\r\ncan  agree  with  him is that we can  improve  the\r\n\r\nbehaviour  and attitudes of our students  if  more\r\n\r\nparents  take an interest in looking  after  their\r\n\r\nchildren while they are away from schools. I think\r\n\r\nthis trend should spread through a society because\r\n\r\nin   a  very  highly  urban  uric!  industrialised\r\n\r\nsociety  the tendency is for more and more parents\r\n\r\nto  leave  the training or their children entirely\r\n\r\nto  the  schools  So  if parents  will  take  more\r\n\r\ninterest  and  more  time in looking  after  their\r\n\r\nchildren, half the battle is won.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that some parents do not fulfil the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of training their children, but  by\r\n\r\nand large, most of them do. We only hope that more\r\n\r\nanti more parents, having listened to the views of\r\n\r\na professional educator about the role of parents,\r\n\r\nwill  now take an interest in their wards, so that\r\n\r\nit  makes  it  easier  for us  to  give  them  the\r\n\r\nrequisite education and an all-round education for\r\n\r\ntheir future development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbefore  I beg leave to withdraw, I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that the Minister has not answered  my\r\n\r\nquestion.

But if the allegation is unfounded,\r\n\r\nI think the complainant himself should be punished\r\n\r\nfor  a  false complaint. Sir, I have brought  this\r\n\r\nmatter  up  because I feel that  if  a  school  is\r\n\r\nundergoing  great reform there will  be  lots  and\r\n\r\nlots  of  complaints  and counter-complaints.  And\r\n\r\nanother  related point is that at  the  time  when\r\n\r\nprincipals  were enjoying the post-allowance,  the\r\n\r\nteachers  would  make  complaints  against   their\r\n\r\nprincipals before their retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> My apology to the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar because I have completely left him  out\r\n\r\nwhile turning over my notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the point that he raised with regard\r\n\r\nto  scurrilous  allegations, the  Member  must  be\r\n\r\naware  that  during  the last  year  we  have  not\r\n\r\nentertained    any   frivolous    or    scurrilous\r\n\r\nallegations  by anonymous writers.

We  do  not  just  act  on  receipt  of  any\r\n\r\nanonymous letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a large number of his colleagues disagreed\r\n\r\nwith  his  view  that  seminars  serve  no  useful\r\n\r\npurpose.  We  have  received,  as  well   as   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  requests for more of these  seminars.\r\n\r\nSo  they  must  have served a useful purpose.  The\r\n\r\nMember  also  said that most of the  teachers  are\r\n\r\ngeneral teachers; that they take several subjects,\r\n\r\nand  it  is a waste of time to spend two or  three\r\n\r\nhours  listening to a specialist. I say that  even\r\n\r\nif  a  teacher does not teach the subject  of  the\r\n\r\nseminar  which  he is attending, he  will  be  the\r\n\r\nbetter  man  for it because he is learning  first-hand tips from a specialist who knows the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree with the Member that seminars are\r\n\r\nnot  well-planned.

I  am\r\n\r\nnot opposed to the holding of seminars. What I  am\r\n\r\nsaying is that with this short duration of one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  hours only for the seminars, even if you  can\r\n\r\nget the experts to lecture, you cannot make better\r\n\r\nteachers  out of those trained in the old  or  new\r\n\r\nteaching methods. The period is so short that  you\r\n\r\ncannot produce any results at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is this. I have received\r\n\r\ncomplaints from my members against the seminar  on\r\n\r\nthe teaching of music. The music specialist in the\r\n\r\nseminar  was  publicising his own  composition  of\r\n\r\nmusic.  That  cannot be called a true seminar.  On\r\n\r\nthe  seminar  on  physical  education,  it  was  a\r\n\r\nsession for the selling of lottery tickets run  by\r\n\r\nInche  Othman  Wok.  Can this  be  called  a  true\r\n\r\nseminar? I am not opposed to seminars as such.  In\r\n\r\nfact,   I  am  asking  for  longer  sessions   for\r\n\r\nseminars, so that teachers can really\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlearn  something.

A\r\n\r\nseminar  does  not  improve  one's  knowledge   or\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of a situation,  but  to  make  one\r\n\r\nunderstand the situation and therefore make one  a\r\n\r\nbetter teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the selling of tickets, it is\r\n\r\nprobable that some teachers undertook this  extra-mural  activity.

Sometimes when forms have  been\r\n\r\nfilled  in  and  submitted  to  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation,  they  are returned because  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen wrongly filled.

In fact, with  the  closing\r\n\r\ndown  of the School of Education in the University\r\n\r\nof Singapore, the T.T.C, will enlarge its function\r\n\r\nand  take over the work of the School of Education\r\n\r\nin  preparing students for post-graduate  degrees.\r\n\r\nlike Master of Education and Ph.D. (Education).

As far back as  1961,  a  Foreign\r\n\r\nQualifications Committee was set up by the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission  to assess the  qualifications\r\n\r\nand to consider the merits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  applicants  possessing foreign degrees.

What\r\n\r\nschemes  are  there, if any, to cover occupational\r\n\r\nrisks   and  accidents  for  teachers?

This  is a very sound  policy  indeed.\r\n\r\nHowever,  on  second thought, do all our  students\r\n\r\nhave  an  aptitude  for technical  education?  The\r\n\r\naptitude  test  at  present carried  out  is  very\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory.  It takes into  consideration  the\r\n\r\nschool   examination  results,  and  the  workshop\r\n\r\npractice. From the results of this test  only  the\r\n\r\nbest  students  go to the technical  schools.  The\r\n\r\nrest  are  left  to  plod their  way  in  academic\r\n\r\nschools.  This system of selection will mean  that\r\n\r\nthe  State  is liable to lose political scientists\r\n\r\nand  experts in the other fields. Moreover, do  we\r\n\r\nhave enough technical schools in Singapore? Are we\r\n\r\nnot  emphasising  too much on technical  education\r\n\r\nand   producing  too  many  school  leavers   with\r\n\r\nsecondary  technical education and thus produce  a\r\n\r\nsurplus of technicians?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not speaking Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  emphasis  on education has been shifted  from\r\n\r\nthe  academic to the technical, resulting  in  the\r\n\r\nEstablishment    of   the   Technical    Education\r\n\r\nDepartment.  Technical education  has  been  given\r\n\r\npriority  from all quarters, and consequently  the\r\n\r\nofficials  in  the Technical Education  Department\r\n\r\nseem to have become rather arrogant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received complaints from principals and\r\n\r\nteachers that there is too much bureaucracy in the\r\n\r\nTechnical  Education Department. I  have  personal\r\n\r\nexperience of this attitude. I have tried to  take\r\n\r\nup the case of a teacher who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclaims recognition of his past teaching experience\r\n\r\nbut  without results. I wrote two letters  on  the\r\n\r\n14th of June and the 21st of July last year to the\r\n\r\nTechnical Education Department. There was not even\r\n\r\nan  acknowledgement, not to say of achieving a due\r\n\r\nreply.  Such  treatment is meted  out  even  to  a\r\n\r\nMember of Parliament, and let us not mention about\r\n\r\ntreatment to members of the public. I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  or not letters from Members of Parliament\r\n\r\ncarry   any  weight,  or  is  it  a  question   of\r\n\r\ninefficiency  in  the department itself?  I  would\r\n\r\nlike the Minister to explain this in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to raise is the question\r\n\r\nof textbooks for technical subjects. We are on the\r\n\r\nfourth year of technical education. However, there\r\n\r\nare  still  no proper textbooks for the  technical\r\n\r\nstudents.  There is only the syllabus on technical\r\n\r\neducation, and because of the dearth of  textbooks\r\n\r\ndifferent  teachers have devised  different  notes\r\n\r\nfor  distribution to students. As  a  result,  the\r\n\r\nprogress  in technical education differs from  one\r\n\r\nschool  to  another.  I do not  know  whether  the\r\n\r\nTechnical  Education  Department  has  taken   any\r\n\r\naction to produce textbooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have also received complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  principals  of schools  which  do  not  have\r\n\r\ntechnical  classes for Secondary III  and  onwards\r\n\r\nthat,  as a result of the aptitude test all  their\r\n\r\nbest  students have been selected  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\ntechnical schools. This has been mentioned by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson just now. If the best  students\r\n\r\nare  selected for the technical classes, what will\r\n\r\nhappen to the teaching of the humanities and other\r\n\r\nsocial  sciences? Of course, we will  produce  the\r\n\r\nbest  of  technicians, However, if we do not  have\r\n\r\npeople with a knowledge of the humanities and  the\r\n\r\nsocial sciences, then we can at best build only  a\r\n\r\ntechnical  society which can be listless.  In  the\r\n\r\nlong-term  interest of the nation, I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether or not this is good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that after these students have\r\n\r\nbeen  selected for the technical classes in  other\r\n\r\nschools, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextra-curricular  activities, in  particular,  the\r\n\r\nuniformed  groups in their schools,  are  affected\r\n\r\nand put at a great disadvantage. They cannot carry\r\n\r\non their activities because the best students have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  away. I would like  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nthink of a solution to this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  always  been  aware of the  need  to  develop\r\n\r\nsafety  consciousness and correct work habits  and\r\n\r\naptitude  among technical students,  In  fact,  we\r\n\r\nconsider  this  an  integral  part  of  the  whole\r\n\r\ntraining.  In  most  technical  schools,  we  have\r\n\r\nintroduced instruction in first aid, and  in  most\r\n\r\nschools  we  have  such  a  set-up  as  a   safety\r\n\r\ncommittee. Constant care is always taken to stress\r\n\r\nthe  safety  aspect of workshop  practice  to  the\r\n\r\nstudents by the teachers. In fact, pupils are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to use any machine unless they have  been\r\n\r\nbriefed by the teachers on its proper use and  the\r\n\r\nsafety precautions to be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Moulmein also raised\r\n\r\ncertain  issues  about the question  of  insurance\r\n\r\ncoverage   in  case  of  accidents  occurring   in\r\n\r\ntechnical  schools.  All  technical  teachers   in\r\n\r\nGovernment schools enjoy the same coverage as  any\r\n\r\ncivil  servant.  So  there is  no  question  of  a\r\n\r\nseparate    insurance   scheme   to   cover    any\r\n\r\noccupational hazards encountered by them.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  aided schools, their technical  teachers\r\n\r\nare in a position similar to all other teachers in\r\n\r\naided  schools, where there is no insurance scheme\r\n\r\nto   cover  them.  It  is  up  to  the  management\r\n\r\ncommittee  of  the school to decide  whether  they\r\n\r\nshould provide such an insurance scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been no major injuries sustained by\r\n\r\nthe  technical students so far, largely due to the\r\n\r\nsafety  precautions that we have taken, But should\r\n\r\nany  accident occur to students in the  Government\r\n\r\nschools,    the   Government   will   take    full\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the accident, as in  the  recent\r\n\r\ncase of accident in Anderson Secondary School.  In\r\n\r\nthe case of aided schools, I am afraid the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst  claim will be on the management  committee.\r\n\r\nTo  the best of my knowledge, there is no precedent\r\n\r\ncase yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be interested to know that for the\r\n\r\nstudents  of  the only Government-aided  vocational\r\n\r\ninstitute,   i.e.,   the  Boys'   Town   Vocational\r\n\r\nInstitute,  there  is a limited form  of  insurance\r\n\r\ncover  for  each  student provided  by  the  school\r\n\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has some misgivings about\r\n\r\nthe  channelling exercise. As pointed  out  by  the\r\n\r\nMember himself, the channelling exercise was  based\r\n\r\non  (a)  aptitude;  and  (b) their  performance  in\r\n\r\nrelated  subjects, i.e., Language, Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nScience  over the first two years in the  secondary\r\n\r\nschool. As far as we are concerned, the preliminary\r\n\r\nevidence seems to indicate that the system  we  are\r\n\r\nadopting   is   functioning  very   satisfactorily,\r\n\r\nalthough I must admit that no amount of testing and\r\n\r\nmeasurement is 100 per cent accurate, and there  is\r\n\r\nbound to be a few exceptional cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid it is not true that we have put too\r\n\r\nmuch  emphasis on technical education.  After  all,\r\n\r\ntechnical  education is only part of  an  all-round\r\n\r\neducation to be provided in secondary schools.  And\r\n\r\nthere is, therefore, no danger of over-training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member also asked for the number of\r\n\r\ntechnical   students.  The  intake   of   technical\r\n\r\nstudents   depends  very  much  on   the   manpower\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  our industrialisation  programme.\r\n\r\nOur  present level, which is roughly one-third,  or\r\n\r\none   in   every  three  school  leavers  will   be\r\n\r\ntechnically  biased, is, I think, about  the  right\r\n\r\nlevel  for  any country. I do not think  we  should\r\n\r\nincrease it any further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong referred to the efficiency\r\n\r\nof  the  Department of Technical Education. I  must\r\n\r\napologise if the Department has not replied to  his\r\n\r\nletter.  It must be due to an administrative  slip-up. I give him my assurance that it will not happen\r\n\r\nagain  and, in future, all such inquiries  will  be\r\n\r\nacknowledged immediately. The particular case\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Jurong has raised has become so\r\n\r\nfamous  that  it has also come to my  ears.  It  is\r\n\r\nabout  a  teacher with teaching experience in  some\r\n\r\nother  countries,  and the delay  was  due  to  the\r\n\r\nprolonged  correspondence between the Ministry  and\r\n\r\nthe  foreign government on the recognition  of  his\r\n\r\nexperience as a teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical education has only been introduced very\r\n\r\nrecently  and we have not really drawn  up  a  very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive list of textbooks to be used; we have\r\n\r\nto  bear in mind that the system we adopt, which is\r\n\r\nthe  modular  system,  is  quite  unique.  We  will\r\n\r\ndevelop  the  textbooks  to  be  used  by  all  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  students. The guidelines we  provide  to\r\n\r\nthe  teachers are very comprehensive and, in  fact,\r\n\r\nare  based on a programme-learning approach,  which\r\n\r\nis  fairly satisfactory. In fact, the Member may be\r\n\r\ninterested  to know that we are in the  process  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping textbooks for metal work at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Members for Jurong and Anson raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  students  being  transferred  out  of\r\n\r\nacademic  schools to attend technical  schools.  We\r\n\r\ntried to rectify this by introducing the concept of\r\n\r\nthe   arrangement  of  centralised   workshops   at\r\n\r\nTechnical  III  and IV      levels,  which  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing  practised for 16 schools, whereby a  student\r\n\r\nwill  remain  in  his  own  school  but  go  to   a\r\n\r\ncentralised place to study the technical  subjects.\r\n\r\nThis  arrangement  unfortunately  will  affect  the\r\n\r\nE.C.A  activities of the students  and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nboth the supervisor of the centralised workshop and\r\n\r\nthe  principal of the sender-school have been asked\r\n\r\nto   liase   with  each  other  to  cut  down   the\r\n\r\ninterference  with  the E.C.A, activities  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nexplanation by the Minister of State for Education,\r\n\r\nI beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood on the Order Paper\r\n\r\nSupplement -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr P.

But it appears  that,  in\r\n\r\ntact,  most  of  the  points  have  already  been\r\n\r\ncovered   by  my  colleagues,  the  Backbenchers.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is still one small point  which  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  raise since I have missed it just  now,\r\n\r\nand  that  is, the Milk Feeding Scheme  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen   introduced.  This  is,  in  fact,  a   new\r\n\r\nprovision which comes under subhead 2127.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally welcome the setting up of such a\r\n\r\nscheme  in  our  schools.  I  presume  this  Milk\r\n\r\nFeeding  Scheme  is for primary school  children,\r\n\r\nbut I would like to know whether the provision of\r\n\r\n$10,800   is  sufficient  for  all  the   primary\r\n\r\nschools. I understand that this is a pilot scheme\r\n\r\nto  cover  only a few primary schools,  and  that\r\n\r\nchildren are given powdered milk, But it  appears\r\n\r\nto  me  that in some schools the children do  not\r\n\r\nlike either the taste of the powdered milk or its\r\n\r\ncolour. Therefore, these schools tried to  induce\r\n\r\nthem  to drink by adding some colouring. But this\r\n\r\ndoes not go a long way to make them drink either.\r\n\r\nSubsequently,  I was told that sugar  was  added,\r\n\r\nbut I do not know what the result is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek some clarification from\r\n\r\nthe Minister as to what steps are being taken  to\r\n\r\nencourage more school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren  to  take  to the drinking  of  milk,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that this supply of powdered milk  comes\r\n\r\nfrom  UNICEF.  Has  the  Ministry  any  plans  to\r\n\r\nsupplement this scheme by giving a better type of\r\n\r\npowdered milk instead of the present supply which\r\n\r\nhas  no  taste and has to be sweetened by  adding\r\n\r\nsugar?

This Milk Feeding Scheme is  run  on  a\r\n\r\nnation-wide basis. I think it applies practically\r\n\r\nto  all  the primary schools.

The\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State in all probability  was  also\r\n\r\nbrought up on milk to a certain extent! As I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  it was probably the type of powdered  milk\r\n\r\nwith a taste which the children did not like, and\r\n\r\nthe  quality  was not too good. I  am  not  quite\r\n\r\nsure, but perhaps his Ministry would care to look\r\n\r\ninto  this  to  see why a good number  of  school\r\n\r\nchildren  do not like this kind of milk  supplied\r\n\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, no doubt I was brought\r\n\r\nup  on milk also, but when we were young we  were\r\n\r\nalways hungry; there was not much choice!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education does not have to carry\r\n\r\nout  an  investigation to find out why  our  young\r\n\r\nchildren  do  not  like to drink  milk.

The  contract for the  printing  was\r\n\r\nawarded to the lowest tender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to his other question about granting\r\n\r\nstudy leave to teachers, the answer is yes, if the\r\n\r\nsubjects  of  study are relevant to  the  teaching\r\n\r\nservice.  But  each  individual  case  has  to  be\r\n\r\nconsidered on its own merit,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wanted to know the number of\r\n\r\nMalay  students who are successful in their option\r\n\r\nfor  the  technical stream, and the number allowed\r\n\r\nto take the technical subjects of their choice.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to inform the House that all technical\r\n\r\nstudents,  irrespective  of  language  media,  are\r\n\r\ngiven  the  opportunity to indicate the preference\r\n\r\nfor  workshop  subjects. While the  preference  is\r\n\r\ntaken  into  account,  the final  selection  of  a\r\n\r\nstudent  for the various workshop subjects depends\r\n\r\non  his  aptitude and performance in the  workshop\r\n\r\nsubjects  in  Secondary I and II levels,  and  his\r\n\r\nperformance  in the relevant supporting  subjects,\r\n\r\nfor example, Mathematics and Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd.

Is  this  a\r\n\r\nrelevant subject as mentioned by the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd.
