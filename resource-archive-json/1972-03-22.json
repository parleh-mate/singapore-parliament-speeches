In fact, it can be said that the\r\n\r\ncoordination  among all the agencies  that  I  have\r\n\r\njust outlined also leaves much, to be desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears as if plans are drawn for an area\r\n\r\nearmarked  for  development, and  as  soon  as  the\r\n\r\noverall  plans  are  approved  the  squatters   and\r\n\r\nlandowners  are  issued  with  clearance  and  land\r\n\r\nacquisition  notices. No planning or  co-ordination\r\n\r\ntakes place at this juncture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the number of houses to be cleared, within what\r\n\r\nperiod  and  to  where they are  to  be  resettled.\r\n\r\nPhased  acquisition of land and land  clearance  is\r\n\r\nnot  properly carried out. Squatters and landowners\r\n\r\nare  asked to move out even though the Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment   is   unable   to   provide    suitable\r\n\r\nalternative .accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you are aware that Telok Blangah is under an\r\n\r\nintensive urban renewal project, and I know what  I\r\n\r\nam  talking  about. In some phases of  acquisition,\r\n\r\none-room  flats  are  offered  to  large  families,\r\n\r\nbecause they are the only ones available. In  other\r\n\r\nphases of acquisition, families which cannot afford\r\n\r\nto  pay  high rentals are offered 2-room and 3-room\r\n\r\nflats  because  these are the only ones  available.\r\n\r\nThe Lettings and Sales Sections cannot cope up with\r\n\r\nflat  requirements  of the Resettlement  Department\r\n\r\nand  everybody  is  under pressure,  including  the\r\n\r\nMember  of Parliament.

Owners   of\r\n\r\nhouses   do   not  repair  dwellings  while   under\r\n\r\nclearance   notices,  and  tenants'  requests   for\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board flats are  not  met,\r\n\r\nthe  reason  being that the areas are not  required\r\n\r\nfor immediate clearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nobody likes to move out of a place where\r\n\r\none  has  been  living  in for  years,  paying  low\r\n\r\nrentals,  or  no  rental at all in  the  rural  and\r\n\r\nsuburban   areas.  If  people,  who   are   already\r\n\r\nreluctant to move out, are further burdened by  the\r\n\r\noffer  of  flats miles away from where  they  work,\r\n\r\nresentment breaks out especially when they have  to\r\n\r\npay  higher  rentals  and  have  to  travel  longer\r\n\r\ndistances to their places of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my constituents in Pulau Brani, Sentosa,\r\n\r\nBukit  Theresa, Bukit Purmei, Radin Mas and Kampong\r\n\r\nHeap\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuan  San,  who are all affected by urban  renewal,\r\n\r\nare  dependent  on the Port of Singapore  Authority\r\n\r\nand  the sea for their livelihood.

Many residents of  Sentosa\r\n\r\nare  boatmen, solely depending on the sea for their\r\n\r\nlivelihood,  i.e, ferrying cargo. They ply  between\r\n\r\nships  anchored  in the outer roads and  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  have  contributed to the  entrepot  trade  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and will continue to contribute  to  make\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore harbour a thriving one. They are  an\r\n\r\neconomic necessity to the survival of Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nhave  no  quarrel  with making  Sentosa  a  tourist\r\n\r\nparadise.  But what does the Government propose  to\r\n\r\ndo  with  the residents of Sentosa who depend  upon\r\n\r\nthe  sea  for their livelihood? If they  are  moved\r\n\r\nout,  will  they be given alternative accommodation\r\n\r\nclose to the sea? Will they be provided shore space\r\n\r\nto  moor  their boats? Or will they be  allowed  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  remaining in one part of Sentosa  and  be\r\n\r\nallowed to continue to ply their traditional trade\r\n\r\nbetween the outer roads and Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

That is the crux of\r\n\r\nour resettlement problem. However, if Singapore  is\r\n\r\nto   develop,   there  must  be  resettlement.   He\r\n\r\ncomplains of the lack of co-ordination between  the\r\n\r\nResettlement    Department,   The    Housing    and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board and the Planning Department. I do\r\n\r\nnot   think  he  has  been  fair  to  these   three\r\n\r\ndepartments. They are in one Ministry, and they  do\r\n\r\nco-operate with one another. Perhaps there may have\r\n\r\nbeen  lack  of  liaison between  one  Ministry  and\r\n\r\nanother. Let me give the Member an example.  .  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Defence requires some parts  of  Pulau\r\n\r\nBrani, and resettlement is necessary. But it is the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Defence, and not the Ministry  of  Law\r\n\r\nand    National   Development   that   wants    the\r\n\r\nresettlement  to  be  expedited.  The  Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  then asked to do  the  resettlement\r\n\r\nwork,  a  most unpleasant job in any circumstances.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the Resettlement Department is doing  its\r\n\r\nbest    to    provide   as   suitable   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation as is possible; but people,  shifting\r\n\r\nfrom homes which they have occupied for a long time\r\n\r\nare,  as  the Member has pointed out, reluctant  to\r\n\r\nmove.  Then  they  become choosy. It  is  sometimes\r\n\r\nimpossible  to  provide a Housing Board  flat  near\r\n\r\ntheir  homes.  For example, in Pulau `Brani  or  in\r\n\r\nSentosa there are no Housing Board fiats. As far as\r\n\r\nPulau  Brani is concerned, some of the people  have\r\n\r\nbeen resettled and, as far as I am aware, they  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied.  Out  of 230 families affected  by  this\r\n\r\nproject  of  the Ministry of Defence, 214  families\r\n\r\nhave  been resettled. About 200 families are housed\r\n\r\nin  one-room  flats at Henderson  and  Redhill  and\r\n\r\nabout  30 families in Jurong where they have  one-,\r\n\r\ntwo-  and  three-room flats. Moreover,  the  Marine\r\n\r\nPolice personnel who live in Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquarters in Pulau Brani have vacated their quarters\r\n\r\nand  are  now living in Clementi Road houses  which\r\n\r\nhave  been  vacated  by  the  British  Forces   and\r\n\r\nreverted   to   the   Bases   Economic   Conversion\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as Sentosa is concerned, I would like to\r\n\r\npoint  out to the Member that we are only concerned\r\n\r\nwith  resettlement,  the  unpleasant  part  of  the\r\n\r\nproject.  What will happen to Sentosa  island  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  decided  by the  Sentosa  Development\r\n\r\nCorporation,   after  its  incorporation   shortly.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can assure the Member that nothing  will\r\n\r\nbe  done  until  the  Resettlement  Department  has\r\n\r\ncompleted a survey of the population on the island.\r\n\r\nI  hope  that  it  is  possible  for  part  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation to find employment on the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Urban Renewal Department is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  it is merely involved in  the  physical\r\n\r\nplanning for the development of the island  into  a\r\n\r\ntourist  complex.  It  is not  involved  in  policy\r\n\r\ndecisions,  which  are  really  a  matter  for  the\r\n\r\nCorporation. I have one suggestion to make  to  the\r\n\r\nMember.   In  order  to  lighten  the  effects   of\r\n\r\nresettlement,   perhaps  the  Member   could   make\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the Corporation that one or  two\r\n\r\nvillages in Sentosa be preserved and renovated as a\r\n\r\ntourist  attraction. I believe quite a  few  people\r\n\r\nliving in Sentosa collect and sell sea shells which\r\n\r\nmany a tourist buys. Sentosa is quite a big island,\r\n\r\nand  I am sure one or two villages can be preserved\r\n\r\nfor  this purpose. And for the information  of  the\r\n\r\nMember,  he should make his representation  to  the\r\n\r\nright  quarters,  which  is  not  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the Member complains of the long waiting\r\n\r\nperiod for public housing and that we seldom  offer\r\n\r\nimmediate alternative housing whenever resettlement\r\n\r\nproblems  arise.  We  do  our  best  with  what  is\r\n\r\navailable. Hence, some of the Member's constituents\r\n\r\nwere offered flats in Jurong and some in Henderson.\r\n\r\nSome  were offered flats in Redhill, which are,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  closer to his constituency. The  demand  for\r\n\r\nflats,  whether for rental or purchase, far exceeds\r\n\r\nthe supply. Moreover, a few of these flats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  used  to  resettle people who are affected  by\r\n\r\nGovernment's  urban renewal projects.  The  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  finds  it  difficult to satisfy  everybody's\r\n\r\ndemands.  If the Member is interested, I will  read\r\n\r\nto him the latest figures. As at 29th February this\r\n\r\nyear, there were 21,687 families registered to rent\r\n\r\nHousing  Board flats. At the same date  there  were\r\n\r\n36.906   families  registered  to  purchase  flats,\r\n\r\nmaking  in  all  a  figure reaching  nearly  60,000\r\n\r\nregistrants. The Housing Board built a little  more\r\n\r\nthan  16,000  units last year. It will  build  more\r\n\r\nthis year. However, within the next few years,  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  number which the Board can build,  without\r\n\r\nraising  the  cost price of each flat,  is  in  the\r\n\r\nregion of 20,000 units. If we start building  today\r\n\r\nwith  a backlog of 60,000 units -we can only  build\r\n\r\nabout  20,000 units a year - and every day of every\r\n\r\nmonth  more and more fresh applications for  rental\r\n\r\nor for purchase of flats are made to the Board, and\r\n\r\nwith  more and more Government development projects\r\n\r\ntaking  place,  resulting in more and  more  people\r\n\r\nbeing  resettled, I think it is a little unfair  to\r\n\r\ncomplain  that  there  is a lack  of  co-ordination\r\n\r\nbetween   the   Housing  Board,  the   Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment and the Planning Department. It is  just\r\n\r\na  question of supply and demand. These departments\r\n\r\nare doing their best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to come back to the Member's first\r\n\r\npoint, no one likes to shift, and that is the  crux\r\n\r\nof the problem. We try to do our best for them, but\r\n\r\nit  is difficult to satisfy anyone who has to shift\r\n\r\nfrom  a  home  which he has occupied  probably  for\r\n\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, it is\r\n\r\nwell  known that in recent years it has become  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the  Housing and Development  Board  to\r\n\r\nencourage  our  citizens to purchase Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats.  However, it seems to me that in some  cases\r\n\r\nthis  encouragement has been over-enthusiastic.  It\r\n\r\nhas  come  to my attention that flat dwellers,  who\r\n\r\nhave  applied  for a transfer to bigger  flats,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  new applicants for flats have  been  told\r\n\r\nthat they should apply\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  purchase  rather than for rental  of  the  new\r\n\r\nflats  as this would shorten the period of waiting.\r\n\r\nThis is not true, and everyone knows that flats are\r\n\r\nallocated  on a first come first served basis.  The\r\n\r\nwaiting  list of intending purchasers is, in  fact,\r\n\r\nno  shorter than that of those who intend to  rent,\r\n\r\nas  has just been pointed out by the Minister. Will\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, therefore, please instruct his staff\r\n\r\nnot to be so aggressive in encouraging the purchase\r\n\r\nof  flats. Many people who simply cannot afford  to\r\n\r\npurchase flats feel that they are being bullied  by\r\n\r\nthis  new  tactic. Furthermore, I hope the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board will continue to let out  2-room  or  3-room  flats to poor but  big  families,\r\n\r\nbecause they just cannot afford to buy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the increasing population in\r\n\r\nHousing  Board estates and the addition of  several\r\n\r\nelectoral  divisions,  will the  Minister  consider\r\n\r\nsetting up new Housing Board Area Offices so as  to\r\n\r\nlighten the burden of the present offices,  and  so\r\n\r\nmake them more easily accessible to the public?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Housing Board tenants have lodged\r\n\r\ncomplaints against their noisy neighbours,  but  it\r\n\r\nseems to me that they are to no avail. Some tenants\r\n\r\nhave even abused the use of the common corridors to\r\n\r\nthe  annoyance and irritation of other  tenants.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  if  the Minister will consider  introducing\r\n\r\nlegislation to empower the Area Officers  to  first\r\n\r\nwarn  the  recalcitrants of the noise  and  trouble\r\n\r\nthey  make by ticketing them, and failing that,  to\r\n\r\npenalise them by terminating their tenancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a housewife in my area was robbed and\r\n\r\nstabbed inside a Housing Board lift. Not long ago a\r\n\r\ntragedy  of a different nature also occurred  in  a\r\n\r\nHousing  Board lift, but this took place in another\r\n\r\narea. If we have enough hourly-rated lift operators\r\n\r\nfrom  the  various Housing Board  Area  Offices  to\r\n\r\ncheck  on the safety and security of lift-users  at\r\n\r\ncertain  hours  and in certain crime  prone  areas,\r\n\r\nsuch as mine, then we can prevent similar tragedies\r\n\r\nfrom  occurring  in Housing Board  estates  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture. I think the sheer presence of an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficial  from the Housing Board Area  Office  will\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the sense of safety and security  of\r\n\r\nthe lone lift-user.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board officials have adopted aggressive\r\n\r\ntactics, I would agree with the Member that  it  is\r\n\r\nhighly regrettable, and that such tactics should be\r\n\r\nstopped. However, I find it difficult to understand\r\n\r\nwhy  a  Housing Board officer should use aggressive\r\n\r\ntactics  to force someone to change his application\r\n\r\nfrom  a  transfer to a purchase. Perhaps there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  some  misunderstanding. With the shortage  of\r\n\r\nflats, it is difficult to get a transfer and it  is\r\n\r\nprobably  for  that reason that the  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nofficer  may have advised the applicant to purchase\r\n\r\na  flat  rather  than to apply for  a  transfer.  A\r\n\r\ntransfer means that he is already occupying a  flat\r\n\r\nbut  wants  to move to another flat. There  are  so\r\n\r\nmany others who do not have flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member wants me to assure him that the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  will continue to rent  or  let  out\r\n\r\nflats.  I  gave  this assurance in  this  House  in\r\n\r\nanswer  to  a Question by the Member for Katong.  I\r\n\r\nsaid  that the Housing Board will continue  to  let\r\n\r\nout  20 per cent of the fiats it builds and not  to\r\n\r\nsell every flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lifts, the Housing Board has more than\r\n\r\n1,000  lifts in the various Housing Board  estates.\r\n\r\nIf  we  are  to have lift attendants, we will  need\r\n\r\nabout 3,000 persons to operate 1,000 lifts on a two-\r\n\r\nor  three-shift  basis, and it will  cost  some  $5\r\n\r\nmillion  per year. I am sure the Member will  agree\r\n\r\nthat this is rather prohibitive. As for security in\r\n\r\nthe lifts, the Police are responsible, but I am not\r\n\r\nputting the blame on the Minister for Home Affairs.\r\n\r\nIt  is  quite impractical to expect the authorities\r\n\r\nto  station security guards or policemen  at  every\r\n\r\nblock  of  flats  when there are  more  than  1,500\r\n\r\nblocks  of  flats. At present, about a little  more\r\n\r\nthan  one-third of our population live  in  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard estates, and the number of residents in  each\r\n\r\nblock  ranges  from  several  hundreds  to  several\r\n\r\nthousands. Perhaps the residents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthemselves can get together and keep a look-out  so\r\n\r\nthat  criminal activities can be stopped and  anti-social elements caught. If the residents co-operate\r\n\r\nby  reporting the activities of these criminals,  I\r\n\r\nam  sure the crime rate in our housing estates will\r\n\r\nbe substantially reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for noise, we can pass laws but I am not in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  passing  more and more  laws  to  force\r\n\r\npeople  to do or not to do this and that.  I  would\r\n\r\nrather  persuade, and surely residents  of  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats  can  get  together  and  collectively\r\n\r\nreduce   the   noise  made  by  children,   radios,\r\n\r\ntelevision, motor-cars and motor-cycles. The  Board\r\n\r\nis  doing  its  best  to request  residents  to  be\r\n\r\nconsiderate to one another, and complaints of noise\r\n\r\nnuisance have been dealt with. But the final answer\r\n\r\nto  the  problem really lies in the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents of the flats themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  not  touched  on one of the points  I  raised,\r\n\r\ni.e., whether he is going to increase the number of\r\n\r\nArea  Offices,  in  view of  the  additional  seven\r\n\r\nelectoral divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The number of electoral divisions has\r\n\r\nbeen   increased.

I\r\n\r\nthink the Minister for Law and National Development\r\n\r\nis aware that about 150 premises in my constituency\r\n\r\nare  on temporary occupation licences. Quit notices\r\n\r\nhave  been  issued to chief tenants and  subtenants\r\n\r\nalike after the acquisition of these premises,  and\r\n\r\nthese  tenants  have been been told  to  apply  for\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board flats. Some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplied and got it, but some did not get it.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  were allocated flats have moved out, and those\r\n\r\nwho were not, continued to stay in. Among those who\r\n\r\nwere given Housing Board flats were `chief tenants.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  chief tenants moved into the flats,  the\r\n\r\nsubtenants   will   have   to   take    over    the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of the premises in the  sense  that\r\n\r\nthey  have to pay the temporary occupation  licence\r\n\r\nfees  plus  water  and  light charges,  which  were\r\n\r\npreviously paid by the chief tenants. Although  the\r\n\r\nsubtenants do not mind paying the water  and  light\r\n\r\ncharges, they are prohibited from subletting  those\r\n\r\nvacant  rooms after acquisition, because these  are\r\n\r\nnot  premises or flats built by the Housing  Board,\r\n\r\nbut    premises   previously   owned   by   private\r\n\r\nindividuals.  `Sir, the point is that these  people\r\n\r\nare mostly wage-earners in the low income group. It\r\n\r\nis  impossible  for  them to  bear  any  additional\r\n\r\nfinancial burden unless they are allowed to  sublet\r\n\r\nthe  vacant rooms. Before the acquisition of  these\r\n\r\npremises  by  the Government, the sub-tenants  paid\r\n\r\nonly  $10 to $15 a month as rental, including water\r\n\r\nand  light charges. But now they have to  pay  very\r\n\r\nmuch more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another complication after\r\n\r\nacquisition,  and  that is the condition  of  these\r\n\r\npremises is far from satisfactory for many  of  the\r\n\r\npremises are 50 to 60 years old and are in need  of\r\n\r\nmajor  repairs. But the occupiers are placed  in  a\r\n\r\ndilemma  because they are wondering whether  it  is\r\n\r\nworth  their while to repair. They are afraid  that\r\n\r\ntheir money spent on repairs will be wasted if they\r\n\r\nwere  asked to quit shortly after the repairs  were\r\n\r\ndone. And this is possible since the Government has\r\n\r\nnot  been able to inform them as to when the  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal   project   will  take   place.   In   this\r\n\r\nconnection, Sir, I would therefore like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Law and National Development  whether\r\n\r\nhe will be able to inform them as to when the urban\r\n\r\nrenewal project is likely to commence, so that  the\r\n\r\noccupiers will be able to decide whether or not  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  those  necessary  repairs  to  the  old\r\n\r\nhouses. Secondly, will the Minister be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprepared  to waive those regulations which prohibit\r\n\r\nthe  subletting of the vacant rooms?  If  so,  this\r\n\r\nwill  greatly relieve the financial burden  of  the\r\n\r\noccupiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am afraid I cannot give the\r\n\r\nMember either the assurance he desires or the exact\r\n\r\ndate   when  the  Urban  Renewal  Department   will\r\n\r\ncommence  work  in  the areas  about  which  he  is\r\n\r\ncomplaining. The delay in the implementation of the\r\n\r\nscheme has been due to clearance problems. Once the\r\n\r\nplace is cleared, construction begins. But I do not\r\n\r\nknow  when they will shift. We are not blaming them\r\n\r\nentirely  because  they will not  shift  until  the\r\n\r\nHousing   Board  provides  them  with   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation,   which  at  the   moment   is   not\r\n\r\nsufficient. I believe the areas referred to by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bras Basah fall under the Theng Hai  and\r\n\r\nHolloway redevelopment schemes. To-date, only about\r\n\r\n15  per  cent of the resettlement cases  have  been\r\n\r\ncleared,  and  it is true that in some  cases  only\r\n\r\nsubtenants are left in the premises after the chief\r\n\r\ntenants have moved out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid it is not the practice of the\r\n\r\nLand  Office to allow such State properties  leased\r\n\r\non temporary occupation licences to be repaired, as\r\n\r\nthese  repairs are usually done by the Public Works\r\n\r\nDepartment.  Further, it would  be  undesirable  to\r\n\r\nallow  tenants to do the repairs themselves and  at\r\n\r\ntheir  own expense, as this could lead to extensive\r\n\r\nrenovations, alterations and additions which  would\r\n\r\ntend  to  prolong the occupation once  the  tenants\r\n\r\nhave  spent large sums of money on repairs.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  not the practice to allow such houses  to  be\r\n\r\nsublet  by the chief tenants as this would increase\r\n\r\nclearance  commitments when the area is  eventually\r\n\r\nready  for  development. In fact, it is a condition\r\n\r\nof  the  temporary  occupation licence  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be no subletting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for reductions in rent, the Member can make\r\n\r\nhis  representations.

This,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  will  lessen the long  waiting  time  and\r\n\r\nshortening  the waiting list. At the moment,  there\r\n\r\nis no acute shortage of office or shopping space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the construction of multi-storey\r\n\r\noffice  buildings and shopping complexes should  be\r\n\r\nrestricted, so that the construction of Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  flats could be  increased  from\r\n\r\n20,000   to  25,000  flats  each  year.  Sir,   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of multi-storey office buildings  and\r\n\r\nshopping  complexes is purely for profit only,  but\r\n\r\nthe  construction of Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nmulti-storey flats is a social development for  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  especially those in the lower and  middle\r\n\r\nincome  groups.  They  cannot  afford  to  purchase\r\n\r\nhouses  built  by the private sector because  their\r\n\r\nprices  are  fantastic,  ranging  from  $38,000  to\r\n\r\n$85,000 per unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The compounds  are  in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  bad  state of repair and the  gutters  are\r\n\r\nleaking. Generally, there is litter and filth  both\r\n\r\nin  and  around the compounds. Although  there  are\r\n\r\nagreements entered into between the tenants and the\r\n\r\ndevelopers that the maintenance of these  flats  is\r\n\r\nthe   responsibility   of  the   developers,   such\r\n\r\nundertaking is not observed.

The  Land\r\n\r\nOffice   is   the   Government  agency   which   is\r\n\r\nresponsible,   among   other   things,   for    the\r\n\r\nacquisition of land for development purposes. Every\r\n\r\nyear the Land Office acquires considerable areas of\r\n\r\nland.  Generally  speaking,  there  should  be   no\r\n\r\nproblem   with   the  process  of  acquisition   if\r\n\r\nreasonable  compensation  is  paid  to  those   who\r\n\r\ndeserve  it. But what is the actual position,  Sir?\r\n\r\nThe  Land  Office, to save itself from any trouble,\r\n\r\nnormally  adopts  a perfunctory  manner  by  paying\r\n\r\ncompensation to the landlords instead of taking the\r\n\r\ntrouble  to count the number of families  involved,\r\n\r\nthe buildings, the improvements, and the number  of\r\n\r\nfruit  trees affected by the acquisition. It is  at\r\n\r\nthis point that problems crop up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, it is quite normal to find more\r\n\r\nthan  one  family living on any one piece of  land.\r\n\r\nVery  often the landlord sublets the land to others\r\n\r\nsuch  as  families who live on farming. The farmers\r\n\r\nthen  build  up their farms and homes  and  planted\r\n\r\nfruit  trees on the land, and after many  years  of\r\n\r\nhardwork and toil they begin to enjoy the fruits of\r\n\r\ntheir land labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the land is acquired by Government, it\r\n\r\nis only the landlord who gets the compensation. The\r\n\r\ntenants, in many cases the poor farmers, do not get\r\n\r\na  single cent as compensation. This creates a  lot\r\n\r\nof  problems. Without being compensated, how do you\r\n\r\nexpect them to move out? How do you expect them  to\r\n\r\nresettle elsewhere to rebuild their farms?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Land Office officials for\r\n\r\nthe sake of their own convenience\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave caused considerable trouble to others.\r\n\r\nI  have  received  a number of complaints  of  this\r\n\r\nnature during my \"Meet the people\" sessions.  These\r\n\r\npeople   complained   that  Resettlement   Officers\r\n\r\nvisited them every day in an attempt to force  them\r\n\r\nout  of  their homes. But without getting a  single\r\n\r\ncent  as  compensation, and without any savings  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own, how do you expect them to move out?  Do\r\n\r\nyou  want  them to pull their own houses  down  and\r\n\r\nlive in the open air? Sir, I do not understand  why\r\n\r\nofficials  of  the  Land  Office  cannot  take  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  to make a detailed investigation  to  find\r\n\r\nout  who the owners of the properties are, and  who\r\n\r\nare  the tenants living on the piece of land to  be\r\n\r\nacquired, before they make payment of compensation.\r\n\r\nThey must ensure that compensation is paid to those\r\n\r\nwho  deserve  it,  in order to  eliminate  all  the\r\n\r\nproblems  that may arise out of acquisition,  which\r\n\r\nmay  cause  delay  to the Government's  development\r\n\r\nprogramme. In this way, Sir, the people who get the\r\n\r\ncompensation will be resettled without  difficulty.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the tenants will continue to stay on the\r\n\r\nland because they have no money to move out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when private land is\r\n\r\ncompulsorily acquired under the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nLand Acquisition Act, a search is first made in the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Land Titles and Deeds to ascertain  the\r\n\r\nnames and addresses of the registered owners. It is\r\n\r\nthe  owners  of the land who are paid  compensation\r\n\r\nunder  the Land Acquisition Act, because  they  own\r\n\r\nthe  land. But perhaps there is some confusion here\r\n\r\nbetween  compensation for the land and compensation\r\n\r\nfor  buildings,  perhaps  temporary  buildings,  or\r\n\r\nimprovements  to  the  land, and  fruit  trees.  In\r\n\r\naddition to the notices which are not only gazetted\r\n\r\nbut  also  served on the owners of land, there  are\r\n\r\nacquisition  notices  posted on  the  land  itself,\r\n\r\ninviting  persons  who claim compensation  to  make\r\n\r\ntheir  claims  to  the Collector of  Land  Revenue.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  Land  Acquisition Act, a  claimant  for\r\n\r\ncompensation  must  satisfy the Collector  of  Land\r\n\r\nRevenue that he is the person interested within the\r\n\r\nmeaning of the Act. If he is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerely  a tenant, farmer, or squatter, then  he  is\r\n\r\nnot entitled to compensation as of right, but he is\r\n\r\npaid  ex-gratia compensation for improvements  made\r\n\r\nby him to the land, subject to his proving that the\r\n\r\nimprovements   were  effected  by  him.   But   the\r\n\r\nsituation   is   different  where   the   landowner\r\n\r\nundertakes  to  clear  and compensate  the  tenant,\r\n\r\nfarmer, or squatter. In such a case, it is  he  who\r\n\r\npays  compensation  to his tenants  for  all  their\r\n\r\nimprovements on the land. It is then a  matter  for\r\n\r\nthe  tenant, farmer or squatter to settle his claim\r\n\r\nwith the landowner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that we are as interested\r\n\r\nas   he   is  in  effecting  smooth  eviction   and\r\n\r\nresettlement. It is no use our paying  compensation\r\n\r\nto  the  landowner  only to  find  the  land  still\r\n\r\noccupied  by  squatters and we do  not  get  vacant\r\n\r\npossession.  For  then, nothing  can  be  done.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there are cases where the moment a  notice\r\n\r\nunder  section  3 or under section 5  of  the  Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition  Act is gazetted, people  quickly  move\r\n\r\ninto  the area in order to claim compensation  from\r\n\r\nthe Government. But these are only a few cases. But\r\n\r\nif  many  of  the Member's constituents  have  made\r\n\r\nthese  complaints to him at his \"Meet  the  People\"\r\n\r\nsessions, he should send them with their complaints\r\n\r\nto the Land Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish\r\n\r\nto  draw the attention of the Minister concerned to\r\n\r\nthe  sad plight of the residents living at Koh  Sek\r\n\r\nLim Road, which is in my constituency. Most of them\r\n\r\nwere resettled years ago under development projects\r\n\r\nfor  the  Paya  Lebar Airport.  These  people  were\r\n\r\naffected by the construction of the airport.  Small\r\n\r\nplots  of land used for dwelling purposes, as  well\r\n\r\nas  stove-making and agriculture, were allocated to\r\n\r\nthem  at Koh Sek Lim Village. Sir, Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  especially those representing rural  areas,\r\n\r\nwill  agree with me that stove-making and vegetable\r\n\r\nfarming are not profitable propositions. The people\r\n\r\nengaged  in  these occupations have  to  live  like\r\n\r\neveryone of us here. Therefore, they turn to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncottage-industries, such as iron foundry, furniture-making,  rattan-cleaning  apart  from  farming,  in\r\n\r\norder to supplement their living. These people have\r\n\r\nbeen, issued with notices from the Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nLands  to  stop such activities, because  they  are\r\n\r\nsaid  to  have contravened the terms and conditions\r\n\r\nof their leases. Sir, our Government has been, both\r\n\r\npractical and realistic, and I hope it will  always\r\n\r\nbe.  But  since these poor people cannot supplement\r\n\r\ntheir  living, by stove-making or farming, I  would\r\n\r\nurge the Minister to consider making, amendments to\r\n\r\nthe present conditions of the lease so as to enable\r\n\r\nsuch  people, who are unable to earn a  sufficient\r\n\r\nliving  by  farming or stove-making, to  return  to\r\n\r\ntheir farms, as I mentioned, earlier, to make their\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, those; persons\r\n\r\naffected by the acquisition of land in 1955 for the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Paya Lebar Airport were resettled in\r\n\r\nthe Bedok resettlement area, as pointed out, by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Changi. The allocation of land on  this\r\n\r\narea  was  done  on a, very special basis  in  that\r\n\r\nresettlers  were  not  given Temporary  Occupation,\r\n\r\nLicences  but 60-year leases, with effect from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1955. These leases; carry no premiums  but\r\n\r\nspecial covenants restricting the uses of the land.\r\n\r\nOne  of'  these covenants require the  lessees  to.\r\n\r\nfarm, cultivate, manure and manage the whole of the\r\n\r\nland  they leased in good and husband-like  manner,\r\n\r\nand  to  use  the  buildings  erected  thereon  for\r\n\r\ndwelling  purposes only. Recently, it has  come  to\r\n\r\nlight that, in a number of cases, the law has  been\r\n\r\nflouted and the lessees have breached this covenant\r\n\r\nby  using the land not for agricultural or dwelling\r\n\r\npurposes,  but for purposes foreign to  the  lease,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  rattan-splitting, metal works,  furniture\r\n\r\nmanufacture, sundry shop, etc. Hence  they  run  to\r\n\r\ntheir' Member of Parliament for help. Notices were,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  served  by the Land'  Office  on  these\r\n\r\nlessees  for  breach of the covenant.  However,  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the  number of appeals received  and  the\r\n\r\nappeal from the Member for Changi, a survey of  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of the Bedok resettlement area is now  being\r\n\r\ncarried out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the Land Office to ascertain the extent of  and\r\n\r\nreasons   for  the  breaches,  and  other   related\r\n\r\ninformation.  The Primary Production Department  is\r\n\r\nalso  being  asked  to advise on  the  agricultural\r\n\r\npotentials of the area. The Member will be glad  to\r\n\r\nknow   that   consideration  as  to  whether   this\r\n\r\nrestrictive covenant in the lease should be removed\r\n\r\nto  enable the lessees to use the land for purposes\r\n\r\nother than agriculture can only be given after  the\r\n\r\nsurvey  is  completed and the report, incorporating\r\n\r\nthe views of the Primary Production Department,  is\r\n\r\nmade  available. But consideration will  be  given,\r\n\r\nand I hope the Member is satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nhave  a  very  good explanation from  the  Minister\r\n\r\nregarding land and housing problem. But I think  it\r\n\r\nis  proper  for me to explain the position  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  Where a building has been  leased  on  a\r\n\r\nTemporary Occupation Licence, the occupants  should\r\n\r\nbe  given permission to carry out minor renovations\r\n\r\nto  the building. I say this because there are some\r\n\r\nbuildings  which are going to collapse, and  unless\r\n\r\nrenovation is carried out they would have to go  to\r\n\r\nthe Housing Board for flats. As it stands, the Land\r\n\r\nOffice   in  most  cases  has  refused   to   grant\r\n\r\npermission for any form of renovation or  extension\r\n\r\nto be carried out to these buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are certain areas in Singapore where\r\n\r\nthe land belongs to the Government. Since this land\r\n\r\nis  not used for any particular purpose, can we not\r\n\r\nallow  some form of cultivation to be carried  out,\r\n\r\nsuch as farming, provided the occupants do not  put\r\n\r\nup  any  structures on the land, and provided  they\r\n\r\nreturn the land to Government without compensation?\r\n\r\nThis   will   help   Singapore's   production    of\r\n\r\nvegetables, thereby reducing our dependence on  our\r\n\r\nneighbours for our vegetable supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to bring up is\r\n\r\nthis:  when  a building catches fire  but  is  only\r\n\r\nslightly burned, why should the Land Office  insist\r\n\r\nthat  the  occupants should move out? Why  are  the\r\n\r\nresidents not allowed to continue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   occupy   the   building  after   repairs   and\r\n\r\nrenovations have been carried out? There  are  many\r\n\r\nbuildings in such a state. They are still  in  very\r\n\r\ngood  condition  in spite of the slight  damage  by\r\n\r\nfire,  but they are all locked up to prevent people\r\n\r\nfrom  going in. The occupants, therefore,  have  no\r\n\r\nplace  to  go  to, but to the Housing Board.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the  demand for' Housing  Board  flats  is\r\n\r\nincreasing. What we can do to help is to allow them\r\n\r\nto  carry out repairs and to let them continue  to\r\n\r\noccupy the premises for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a building at No. 13 Choon; Guan Street,\r\n\r\nwhich  is in my constituency. I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister to go' and see it. The building is  in\r\n\r\ngood condition, but nobody is occupying it. It, was\r\n\r\nonly  slightly burnt. In fact, only the groundfloor\r\n\r\nwas  slightly  burnt. Yet the door remained  closed\r\n\r\nand nobody is occupying the building. It is a three-storey building and many families can, stay in  it.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the Government's urban renewal policy  is\r\n\r\nsuch  that nobody can occupy it. We must relax this\r\n\r\npolicy.  Under  the  urban  renewal  schemes,  many\r\n\r\nresidents in old buildings have been asked to  move\r\n\r\nat  short  notice. I am referring  to  the  private\r\n\r\ndevelopers.  When  a  private developer  wishes  to\r\n\r\ndevelop a piece of land on which there are some old\r\n\r\nbuildings,  he may offer $1,000 or $2,000  to  each\r\n\r\ntenant  and  ask them to quit; their houses.  These\r\n\r\nare  poor people' and they think that $1,000  is  a\r\n\r\nlot  of'  money.  They  also think  that  they  can\r\n\r\nstraightaway get a Housing Board flat by making  an\r\n\r\nimmediate   application  to  the   Housing   Board.\r\n\r\nHowever, having received the $1,000 they find  that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  get  a  flat immediately.  And  these\r\n\r\ntenants may get an advice from their lawyer not  to\r\n\r\nquit  unless they get more money for it.  The  Land\r\n\r\nOffice  must  first see to it that people  who  are\r\n\r\nliving   in   old  houses  are  given   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation  before  granting  approval  to   the\r\n\r\ndeveloper to demolish the houses and to develop the\r\n\r\nland. Only then will the people say that it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  very  fair  deal. When approval is  given  to  a\r\n\r\ndeveloper  to  develop an area, the  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nshould  at the same time build more flats  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  who are to be evicted. We have to  consider\r\n\r\nall  these factors. Therefore, it would be  a  wise\r\n\r\nmove  to  introduce legislation to the effect  that\r\n\r\nwhen  a private developer wishes to develop an area\r\n\r\nhe  should  provide  alternative  accommodation  to\r\n\r\nthose  who are to be evicted and not to offer  mere\r\n\r\nmonetary  compensation. I hope  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nconsider this matter and take any necessary  action\r\n\r\nand  to  allow tenants temporary occupation of  the\r\n\r\npremises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I reply to the\r\n\r\nlast point raised by the Member on the question  of\r\n\r\nalternative  accommodation  for  tenants  occupying\r\n\r\nhouses affected by private development? I think the\r\n\r\nMember  is aware that the whole island of Singapore\r\n\r\nis  governed by the Control of Rent Act  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  in  operation since the last war.  In  short,\r\n\r\nSir,   this  Act  protects  tenants  of  controlled\r\n\r\npremises,  meaning  houses, `buildings  or  offices\r\n\r\nbuilt  or completed on or before the 7th September,\r\n\r\n1947.  If  you live in a controlled premises,  your\r\n\r\nlandlord  cannot evict you. He can only succeed  in\r\n\r\nevicting  you if he pays money. And if  you,  as  a\r\n\r\ntenant  or  an  occupant, accept such  compensation\r\n\r\nfrom  your  landlord and move out, then you  cannot\r\n\r\nclaim  priority for a Housing Board  flat.  In  the\r\n\r\nsame  way  in  the  Golden  Shoe  area  where   the\r\n\r\nControlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act apply,\r\n\r\nthe landlord can evict the tenants provided he pays\r\n\r\ncompensation  as fixed by the Tenants' Compensation\r\n\r\nBoard.  If they are paid compensation, they  should\r\n\r\nfind alternative accommodation for themselves; they\r\n\r\nhave  no  choice.  However, for  the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\ntenants in Singapore, they have a choice. There  is\r\n\r\nno  need  for them to move out. But if they  accept\r\n\r\ncompensation and move out, then they should not ask\r\n\r\nthe  Housing Board for priority to flats. They  can\r\n\r\napply  for flats but they will be put on the points\r\n\r\nsystem. They do not deserve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npriority since they have been paid compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for houses affected by fire, it is not\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy to acquire every piece of  land\r\n\r\non  which  the  buildings  are  affected  by  fire,\r\n\r\nespecially when only the fringe has been  affected.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  conversant  with  the  particular  case\r\n\r\npointed out by the Member, but if he could give  me\r\n\r\nmore particulars I shall look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other point, I do not know whether\r\n\r\nit  is  a question of acquisition or of Government,\r\n\r\nhaving  acquired land and evicting  the  occupants,\r\n\r\ndoing  nothing  to  re-develop it.  Perhaps  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  plans for urban renewal or development  in\r\n\r\nthat area have been delayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am not complaining\r\n\r\nabout  priority  consideration  for  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats for these people. I am only pointing out  the\r\n\r\ntreatment that they get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tenants do not know about the difficulties\r\n\r\nof alternative accommodation. When they are offered\r\n\r\nmoney,  they  do  not hesitate  to  give  up  their\r\n\r\ntenancy.  Money is a very dangerous commodity.  But\r\n\r\nlater,    when    they   cannot   get   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation, they regretted. That is the trouble.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  my point is that we must  prevent  this\r\n\r\nfrom happening again, so that these people will not\r\n\r\nsuffer.  If  I  may repeat, I am  not  saying  that\r\n\r\npriority should be given to these people when  they\r\n\r\napply  for  Housing Board flats. I  only  want  the\r\n\r\nMinister to listen to their complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member\r\n\r\nhas  made the point that money is the root  of  all\r\n\r\nevil.  But surely it is up to Members of this House\r\n\r\nto  advise their constituents. Not everyone here is\r\n\r\na  lawyer, but as far as housing and the Control of\r\n\r\nRent  Act  are concerned, this is what I advise  my\r\n\r\nconstituents - and Members here should also  advise\r\n\r\ntheir  constituents - do not quit unless  they  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  the  amount  of  compensation.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  I  am  referring to  controlled  premises.\r\n\r\nHowever, if an occupant has accepted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompensation, he should not insist on priority  for\r\n\r\nHousing Board accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before\r\n\r\napproving   any   plans   for   development,    the\r\n\r\nauthorities concerned should ask the developer  how\r\n\r\nmany tenants or squatters there are in the area  to\r\n\r\nbe  developed,  and  how  many  houses  are  to  be\r\n\r\ndemolished.  They  should also  ask  whether  these\r\n\r\npeople require alternative accommodation or whether\r\n\r\nthey  prefer  compensation.  Only  after  all  this\r\n\r\ninformation  has been supplied should the  plan  be\r\n\r\napproved.  These innocent people do  not  know  the\r\n\r\nlaw.  That is why we must have a scheme to  protect\r\n\r\nthese  poor people. Private developers are  putting\r\n\r\nup  many multi-storey buildings. They make a lot of\r\n\r\nmoney,  but  the poor tenants suffer  because  they\r\n\r\ncannot get alternative accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret that there\r\n\r\nis  no  such  law  at the moment. We  cannot  force\r\n\r\ndevelopers to provide accommodation for  their  ex-tenants. However, the tenants themselves can insist\r\n\r\non   this  provision  by  refusing  to  shift,  and\r\n\r\nagreeing to do so only on condition that they  will\r\n\r\nbe provided with accommodation in the new building.\r\n\r\nThere  have been a few cases like this. The tenants\r\n\r\nrefused  to  shift until they were  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nplans  could be approved by the Planning Department\r\n\r\nand  until  they  knew where their new  alternative\r\n\r\npremises   would  be  -the  exact  dimensions   and\r\n\r\nlocation  of the building offered by the  landlord.\r\n\r\nThis  can be done by private agreement. To  provide\r\n\r\nfor  this  arrangement in the  law  would  mean  an\r\n\r\namendment  to  the  Control  of  Rent  Act  or  the\r\n\r\nControlled  Premises (Special Provisions)  Act.  At\r\n\r\nthe  time  when  the  Controlled Premises  (Special\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Bill  was being studied  by  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  the Member should have suggested  these\r\n\r\namendments before it was passed in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  not  satisfied  with the answer  given  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.

If this state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  continues,  then our resettlement  schemes\r\n\r\nwill be hampered. If no compensation is paid to the\r\n\r\nsquatters or the tenants, they will not be able  to\r\n\r\nmove out and to rebuild their farms elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also said just now that notices were\r\n\r\nput  up on the land itself to request any claimants\r\n\r\nto  come  forward. As far as I know, these  notices\r\n\r\nare  usually  written in English  and  in  a  legal\r\n\r\nlanguage.  The  notices are, in  fact,  beyond  the\r\n\r\ncomprehension of the man in the street,  let  alone\r\n\r\nthe  farmers.  I  wonder whether any  of  them  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  notices written in English and  couched\r\n\r\nin  legal  language. It is only  the  landlord  who\r\n\r\nunderstands these notices, and probably he will  be\r\n\r\nthe   only  person  to  make  a  claim.  He   will,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   say   that   all   these   lands   and\r\n\r\nimprovements thereon belong to him and  him  alone.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the officials in the Land Office will\r\n\r\npay  everything to the landlord at the  expense  of\r\n\r\nthe  tenants.  I have received many  complaints  of\r\n\r\nthis  nature, and I have referred them to the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice.  The answer I invariably received  is  that\r\n\r\nall  payments of compensation have been made to the\r\n\r\nlandlord  and  nothing more can be done.  Will  the\r\n\r\nMinister  look after the interests of  the  tenants\r\n\r\nwho are not paid any compensation?

Conceicao, Ho Kah Leong and P.\r\n\r\nGovindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the total allocation for expenditure on the\r\n\r\nNational  Development  Division  under  Head   1107\r\n\r\namounts to $14.59 million for this financial  year,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  slightly less than the amount  allocated\r\n\r\nfor 1971-72 which was $15 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department is responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the planning and increasing the production  of\r\n\r\nfarm  produce  in Singapore. With the encouragement\r\n\r\nof  the  Primary Production Department,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  considerable  increase  in  farm  produce  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The Department has also  given  various\r\n\r\nkinds  of assistance to the farmers, which includes\r\n\r\nmethods  of  improved  production,  inoculation  of\r\n\r\npoultry   and   farm  animals  and   technical   or\r\n\r\nscientific  aid to the farmers. The Department  has\r\n\r\nalso introduced better breeds of poultry and pigs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  farmers.  As a result of such  assistance,\r\n\r\nthere  is a considerable increase in the production\r\n\r\nof eggs, meat and pork, and there is also a surplus\r\n\r\nfor export.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of this bumper harvest, poultry\r\n\r\nfarmers  and  pig  rearers have excess  produce  in\r\n\r\nhand.  As  a  result, the' prices of their  produce\r\n\r\ndrop  considerably. This affects  the  pig  rearers\r\n\r\nadversely.  I have tried to analyse the causes  for\r\n\r\nthe  drop  in  the price of pigs and pork.  1  have\r\n\r\nexchanged views with my constituents and, according\r\n\r\nto them, the drop in the price of pigs and pork can\r\n\r\nbe  attributed to two factors. The first is because\r\n\r\nof  the  lack  of  planning in production.  A  year\r\n\r\nbefore  last, the price of pigs reached a  peak  of\r\n\r\nmore   than  $100  per  picul.  This  resulted   in\r\n\r\nincreased production and a rise in income  for  the\r\n\r\npig  rearers.  According to  the  estimates,  their\r\n\r\nproduction increased by more than 100 per cent. But\r\n\r\nthis high price has resulted in a surplus which, in\r\n\r\nturn, has caused a drop in price. The second factor\r\n\r\nis  that  the Monday-off for butchers has caused  a\r\n\r\ndrop in pork consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is any good harvest, it should be\r\n\r\ntaken  as  a good sign. But because of an unlimited\r\n\r\nand unplanned increase in production and because of\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of marketing facilities, the  prices  of\r\n\r\nfarm  produce  have dropped. This is  a  very  hard\r\n\r\neconomic blow to the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to look after the interests of these\r\n\r\nfarmers,  the  best  way is to  set  up  a  farmers\r\n\r\nassociation or a co-operative society. We  have  to\r\n\r\nmake an estimate of the number of pigs required for\r\n\r\nconsumption  and for export in order to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the forces of supply and demand are balanced.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this plan succeed, all the farmers\r\n\r\nmust co-operate. They must understand that this  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  common  good and mutual  benefit  of  all\r\n\r\nfarmers. The proposed farmers co-operative  society\r\n\r\nmust  ensure  that middlemen will not be  able  to'\r\n\r\ncontinue to exploit the farmers or to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanipulate the prices of farm produce. In this way,\r\n\r\nthe prices of farm produce could be stabilised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department has spent more\r\n\r\nthan  $40  million  of public funds  for  the  main\r\n\r\npurpose  of  helping our farmers to  develop  their\r\n\r\nagriculture  and  farming activities  and  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  interest of the farmers. The Department\r\n\r\nhas  experts  as well as organisers in this  field.\r\n\r\nThey  know their jobs and surely they can help  the\r\n\r\nfarmers   to   organise  a  co-operative   society.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the Minister for Social  Affairs  has\r\n\r\nsaid  in this House yesterday that the Registry  of\r\n\r\nCo-operative  Societies would be prepared  to  help\r\n\r\nfarmers organise co-operatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be denied that everything is\r\n\r\ndifficult  at  the  beginning,  but  we  must  also\r\n\r\nbelieve in the proverb that man can move mountains.\r\n\r\nSo with the Government's efforts and organisational\r\n\r\nhelp, coupled with the co-operation of the farmers,\r\n\r\nwe  will  be able to overcome whatever difficulties\r\n\r\nthere  may  be at the beginning. We are  a  dynamic\r\n\r\nGovernment. We have solved the serious  problem  of\r\n\r\nunemployment.    We   have   succeeded    in    our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme. We  have  also  solved\r\n\r\nthe acute shortage of housing. Similarly, Sit, with\r\n\r\nthis  dynamism,  the Primary Production  Department\r\n\r\ncan  give their attention to this problem and solve\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties. The farmers, the Department, and\r\n\r\nthe  animal  feeds producers can come together  and\r\n\r\nwork out a way to stabilise the prices of pigs  and\r\n\r\nother  farm  produce. In this way, the  welfare  of\r\n\r\nnearly 300,000 farmers will be well looked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the economy of\r\n\r\nSingapore operates in a free enterprise system  and\r\n\r\nthe  prices  of  commodities are regulated  by  the\r\n\r\nforces of supply and demand. Prices of farm produce\r\n\r\nare  also  dictated  by such forces.  We  have  had\r\n\r\nprevious  occasions  in  this  House  when  Members\r\n\r\ncomplained that the price of eggs was going  up  or\r\n\r\ndown,  and  I  have explained the reasons  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  several  times. Because of their  perishable\r\n\r\nnature, an over-supply of farm produce will  result\r\n\r\nin a fall in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprices  greater  than  in  other  commodities;  the\r\n\r\nopposite  is  also  true. The  fall  in  prices  of\r\n\r\nprimary  produce  has frequently been  due  to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  themselves over-producing when prices  are\r\n\r\ngood.  This results in a price drop when the market\r\n\r\nis over-supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for pigs, the prices for the last three or\r\n\r\nfour years were relatively high, not less than  $90\r\n\r\nper  picul, but sometimes the price reached a level\r\n\r\nof about $130 per picul. This was the time when the\r\n\r\nproducers  of  pigs  really had  it  good.  At  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  this year, prices of pigs,  however,\r\n\r\nwent down and the price now is about $70 per picul,\r\n\r\nmainly  due to over-production. Singapore  produces\r\n\r\nover 1,100,000 pigs per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department has been\r\n\r\nsupplying  the  farmers  with  up  to-date   market\r\n\r\ninformation.  It  is,  unwise  for  Government   to\r\n\r\nintervene in market prices or the market system, as\r\n\r\nthis    may    have   serious   and    far-reaching\r\n\r\nrepercussions. If the price is high and  we  impose\r\n\r\ncontrols, pigs will be sold in the black market. If\r\n\r\nthe prices are low and we fix the prices higher, no\r\n\r\none  will  buy. Of course, the position is  not  as\r\n\r\nsimple as that, but I am only putting it simply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the suggestion of a co-operative society,\r\n\r\nthis  is,  in  fact,  under the  portfolio  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Social Affairs. The Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment, of course, will be glad to provide  any\r\n\r\nadvice and assistance to farmers who wish to set up\r\n\r\na  co-operative  society. But for any  co-operative\r\n\r\nsociety  to survive, it must rely mainly  on  self-help  and  be  strongly supported  by  the  farmers\r\n\r\nthemselves.  The farmers must also  be  made  fully\r\n\r\naware of the aims, objectives and benefits of  such\r\n\r\na society. A word of warning: the society must have\r\n\r\na strong management. Many such other societies have\r\n\r\nnot   succeeded   because  of   mismanagement   and\r\n\r\nsubsequent lack of support from their members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production  Department  is  in  charge  of\r\n\r\nseveral primary production projects, and these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  resulted in the gathering of much useful  and\r\n\r\ninteresting  knowledge and expertise.  Examples  of\r\n\r\nsuch  projects  are fish rearing, including  edible\r\n\r\nspecies as well as tropical aquarium fish, mushroom\r\n\r\ncultivation  and  hydroponics.  I  would  like   to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that this knowledge and expertise be  made\r\n\r\navailable  to  interested members  of  the  general\r\n\r\npublic through appropriate courses. `They could  be\r\n\r\norganised   either   by  the   Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  itself  or in collaboration,  possibly,\r\n\r\nwith  the  Adult Education Board.  I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  agree  that,  for  example,  orchid\r\n\r\ncultivation   and,  indeed  more   recently,   the,\r\n\r\nbreeding   of  aquarium  fish  have  become   quite\r\n\r\nsignificant commercial activities. In the  case  of\r\n\r\norchid  cultivation, quite an important  factor  in\r\n\r\nits  development has been the interest  of  private\r\n\r\nenthusiasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not be at all surprised that in the case\r\n\r\nof  tropical  fish also, recreational activity  has\r\n\r\nturned  out  in  the end to be quite  a  profitable\r\n\r\nactivity  for many people. It may be possible  that\r\n\r\nwith  more  people  being  interested  in  mushroom\r\n\r\ncultivation   and   hydroponics   as   recreational\r\n\r\nactivities, such enthusiasm may also turn out to be\r\n\r\nprofitable activities; even, in the monetary sense,\r\n\r\nfor  the  individual; and useful for  the  national\r\n\r\neconomy in a humble yet significant way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the knowledge and information\r\n\r\nacquired    from    research    experiments     and\r\n\r\ninvestigations conducted by the Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  in  various farming  topics  are  being\r\n\r\neffectively  disseminated to the farming  community\r\n\r\nand also to the public at large. The department has\r\n\r\nover the years developed a network of ten extension\r\n\r\ncentres in the more important farming areas.  These\r\n\r\ncentres are staffed by qualified officers who visit\r\n\r\nthe farms regularly and give on-the-spot advice  to\r\n\r\nfarmers.  They  also organise training  programmes,\r\n\r\ntalks  and  demonstrations.  Information  is   also\r\n\r\nspread widely through the department's monthly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnews  bulletin, pamphlets, and by way of film shows\r\n\r\nand  rural  news  broadcasts. The Pig  and  Poultry\r\n\r\nResearch and Training Institute and the Fresh Water\r\n\r\nFisheries  Laboratory at Sembawang organise  within\r\n\r\nthe  station  talks and demonstrations  on  various\r\n\r\naspects  of  pig  and  poultry  rearing  and   fish\r\n\r\ncultivation.  The  research  findings  on  mushroom\r\n\r\ncultivation  have  been disseminated  to  some  700\r\n\r\npeople  from all walks of life through a series  of\r\n\r\nshort  courses  conducted between  March  1970  and\r\n\r\nOctober 1971. On hydroponics, the findings  so  far\r\n\r\nindicate that this system of cultivation can  be  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  proposition  for  certain  crops,   but\r\n\r\nresults  have  not been so satisfactory  for  other\r\n\r\ncrops. Further research is, in fact, very necessary\r\n\r\nto  improve and perfect the system. The Farm School\r\n\r\nat  Sembawang offers one-year residential  training\r\n\r\ncourses  for  farm  youths, who are  given  general\r\n\r\ntraining  on  farming  techniques  and  specialised\r\n\r\ntraining  in  animal  husbandry,  horticulture  and\r\n\r\nfresh water fisheries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member has any concrete suggestion,\r\n\r\nperhaps he could make his representations direct to\r\n\r\nthe   Director  of  Primary  Production,  who  will\r\n\r\ncertainly   co-operate  with  the  Adult  Education\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  further publicise  the  results  of\r\n\r\nresearch   and   findings  made  in   the   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  had  more than one occasion in this House  to\r\n\r\nspeak   on   the  treatment  of  farmers   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   and   that  is,  the   treatment   is\r\n\r\ninadequate. After hearing the Minister's  reply  to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Sembawang, we can see that there  is\r\n\r\nevidence   for   this  inadequate  treatment.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the Minister mentioned that  the  current\r\n\r\nprice  of  pigs is $70 per picul. Let me  tell  him\r\n\r\nthat  the current price is less than $50 per picul.\r\n\r\nThis goes to show that either the officials in  the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department are sleeping, or some\r\n\r\nof  them  are deliberately deceiving the  Minister.\r\n\r\nBecause of the fluctuations in prices, farmers  are\r\n\r\ngenerally  adversely  affected,  but  the  Minister\r\n\r\nkeeps on repeating the old theme that prices are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetermined by supply and demand and that he  cannot\r\n\r\ndo  anything about it. I am sure he can  find  ways\r\n\r\nand means of assisting these farmers. For instance,\r\n\r\nhelp  them  to  explore overseas  markets.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment  the Government is merely providing  certain\r\n\r\ntechnical assistance through the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment.  But  that is not  sufficient.  As  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang has pointed out, the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department has, in fact, provided  quite\r\n\r\na  lot  of  technical assistance to  increase  farm\r\n\r\nproduction,  but  what  is the  consequence  of  an\r\n\r\nincrease in the farm production? The consequence is\r\n\r\nan overproduction of farm produce. As a result, the\r\n\r\nfarmers are being exploited by middlemen and prices\r\n\r\ngo down, and farmers stand to lose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government believes in democratic\r\n\r\nsocialism.  I  hope the Government  is  not  merely\r\n\r\ninterested in raising the standard of living of the\r\n\r\nmiddle  and higher classes, but also interested  in\r\n\r\nraising  the  standard  of  living  of  the   lower\r\n\r\nclasses,  especially the farmers and the fishermen.\r\n\r\nI  have  here several question3 to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) I would like to ask the Minister whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is going to allocate certain  areas  of\r\n\r\nland for the use of farmers. Although the land area\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  is limited, we can see that  certain\r\n\r\nareas  are  earmarked  for industrial  development,\r\n\r\nresidential  estates, military purposes,  etc.  Why\r\n\r\ncannot  we do the same thing for the farmers,  that\r\n\r\nis,  to  earmark  certain  areas  for  agricultural\r\n\r\npurposes?  The majority of our farmers in Singapore\r\n\r\nare   occupying  land  under  Temporary  Occupation\r\n\r\nLicences,   meaning   a   licence   for   temporary\r\n\r\noccupation  only. Therefore, the  farmers  have  no\r\n\r\nsecurity of tenure, because at any time they may be\r\n\r\nasked  to  move  out.  I  would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  if  he has earmarked certain  areas  for\r\n\r\nagricultural  purposes, whether he  can  provide  a\r\n\r\nlonger  tenure  for  these  farmers,  for  example,\r\n\r\ngranting  a  30 years' or 50 years' lease  so  that\r\n\r\nfarmers  can carry out their farming activities  in\r\n\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is the Minister going to convert the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department into a statutory board? As  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  board, the department  can  better  look\r\n\r\nafter  the farmers in various ways. A few days  ago\r\n\r\nwe  heard the Minister for Communications say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Telecommunications Department  would  soon  be\r\n\r\nconverted  into  a statutory board.  He  said  that\r\n\r\nafter  conversion  the Board  would  do  better  in\r\n\r\nrespect of recruitment and implementation and  that\r\n\r\nthere would also be a greater degree of flexibility\r\n\r\nin the management of telecommunication services.  I\r\n\r\nwonder if the Minister for National Development  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do the same with the Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment.  For  instance, the Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  as  a statutory authority  can  provide\r\n\r\ninformation  obtained as a result of research,  and\r\n\r\nalso  provide  plans for production and  statistics\r\n\r\nfor the farmers. These farmers can benefit from the\r\n\r\nresult  of  these  various forms of  financial  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  assistance. Another matter is about  the\r\n\r\nuse  of chemicals and fertilizers in the farms,  If\r\n\r\nthe   Primary  Production  Department  can  provide\r\n\r\ntechnical  expertise in respect of these fields,  I\r\n\r\nam sure the farmers will be able to benefit a great\r\n\r\ndeal.  I wonder what the Minister has to say  about\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member accuses me of repeating an\r\n\r\nold theme.

A copy of this Report will be  sent\r\n\r\nto the Member with my compliments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  replied to many points about poultry and pigs.\r\n\r\nBut  what  efforts have been made  by  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department to introduce poultry and  pig\r\n\r\nrearing in flatted factories? Our precious land  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas is generally used for poultry  and\r\n\r\npig  farming.  By centralising their production  in\r\n\r\nflatted factories, production can be increased  and\r\n\r\nexported, thereby bringing the cost of living down.\r\n\r\nThe    Singapore    housewife    has    experienced\r\n\r\n`fluctuations  in the price of fish.  Most  of  the\r\n\r\nfish  we  consume are imported, and  therefore  the\r\n\r\ncatch of fish is subject to the weather. It is high\r\n\r\ntime  we  introduced trawlers for deep-sea fishing.\r\n\r\nThis will not only produce bigger catches, but will\r\n\r\nalso help to bring the price of fish down. Further,\r\n\r\ndeep-sea  fishing is less likely to be affected  by\r\n\r\nweather conditions or foreign market control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the proposals for this scheme of\r\n\r\npig  and  poultry  rearing in flatted  farms  on  a\r\n\r\ncommercial scale\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave been under consideration for some time now.  A\r\n\r\npilot  scheme will be introduced in order to  study\r\n\r\nthe  management  and operational problems,  disease\r\n\r\ncontrol,  and  the design of the buildings.  Whilst\r\n\r\nsuch  a system of farming for pigs and poultry will\r\n\r\noptimise the use of land, the capital investment is\r\n\r\nmuch  higher than for the conventional method.  The\r\n\r\neconomics   have,  therefore,  to  be  worked   out\r\n\r\nproperly before such a method can be introduced  to\r\n\r\nfarmers in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for fish, whilst deep-sea trawling is a\r\n\r\nlaudable idea, it is again not a simple matter.  It\r\n\r\nrequires  high capital as deep-sea fishing  vessels\r\n\r\nand  fishing gear are very expensive. What is  also\r\n\r\nrequired is a high level of skill. It is also  true\r\n\r\nthat,  though deep-sea trawlers are independent  of\r\n\r\nweather  conditions,  they are  very  dependent  on\r\n\r\nfishing  grounds.  Not  every  part  of  the  ocean\r\n\r\ncontains  fish, or fish that can be caught  without\r\n\r\nthe   fishermen  themselves  getting  caught.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  itself is doing all it can  to  promote\r\n\r\ndeep-sea   fishing.  It  provides   the   necessary\r\n\r\ninfrastructure such as ship landing  and  marketing\r\n\r\nfacilities,  training in fishing and research  into\r\n\r\nfishing grounds to encourage the private sector  to\r\n\r\ngo into deep-sea fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Minister mentioned that I have no new theme  to\r\n\r\nspeak  about. It goes to show that the problem  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  solved. If the problem has been  solved,\r\n\r\nthen  I would have dwelt on new ideas and opinions.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister also mentioned that under the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan  for Singapore, there are certain areas  which\r\n\r\nare  allocated for agriculture. I would like to ask\r\n\r\nwhether he can inform the House of the areas  which\r\n\r\nhave  been allocated for agriculture. He  has  also\r\n\r\nomitted one of the points I raised. In these  zones\r\n\r\nwhich  have been allocated for agriculture,  is  he\r\n\r\nprepared  to  grant a longer term of  lease  rather\r\n\r\nthan a Temporary Occupation Licence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer to the last question is a\r\n\r\ndefinite   no.

I am sure  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nequally  interested.  I am  not  objecting  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  statement  that  prices  of  pigs   are\r\n\r\ndetermined  by the supply and demand. But  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  what he is going to  do  about  this\r\n\r\nproblem. When the prices of pigs drop, what is  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production Department going to  do?  Until\r\n\r\nnow,  has the Depart-went done anything to  reverse\r\n\r\nthe trend of falling prices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer is nothing has been done.\r\n\r\nIt  is up to the farmers to produce less. When  the\r\n\r\nprices  of pigs were high, we have never heard  one\r\n\r\nsqueak from the Member. When the prices are low, he\r\n\r\nasks what is the Department doing about it. It is a\r\n\r\nquestion  of supply and demand - produce  less  and\r\n\r\nthe  prices will go up, produce more and the prices\r\n\r\nwill  go  down. They should not run to the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department every  time  something  goes\r\n\r\nwrong, but try `to learn to look after themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo  not  agree with what the Minister has said.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Government is sincere in helping the  farmers,\r\n\r\nit  can  do  so by looking for overseas markets  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  could export their pigs.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  that in the last two years the prices of pigs\r\n\r\nwere  very high. If the Minister is going  to  help\r\n\r\nthe  farmers,  then he can try to  help  them  sell\r\n\r\ntheir  pigs  overseas. The Government can  help  by\r\n\r\ndoing this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, there are many ways of exporting\r\n\r\nand selling pigs. The Primary Production Department\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalways  been  behind the farmers.  Pigs  have  been\r\n\r\nexported to Malaysia, and also to Sabah. From  time\r\n\r\nto  time  a ban is imposed. In fact, at the moment,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  ban against the import of  pigs  into\r\n\r\nthese  countries.  But  there  are  other  avenues.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  when  the  price is  up,  the  consumers\r\n\r\nshout.  Therefore,  I think it is  unfair  for  the\r\n\r\nMember  to come to this House and ask what  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing  when  the price is down, or to say  that  he\r\n\r\ndoes not get any satisfactory answers from me. They\r\n\r\nmust learn to control their supply with the demand.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  price of eggs goes up, the  farmers  are\r\n\r\nhappy,  but the consumers are angry. So I  have  to\r\n\r\nanswer  questions in this House  about  what  I  am\r\n\r\ndoing  to get the price of eggs down. And when  the\r\n\r\nprice  goes down, someone asks: what are you  doing\r\n\r\nto bring the price of eggs up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I think we can give the Minister some rest.  I\r\n\r\nbeg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (2), Mr Ho Kah Leong. Are\r\n\r\nyou going to repeat the same theme on Fisheries, Mr\r\n\r\nHo?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1107 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1111.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I would like to\r\n\r\ntalk  about  the  problem of fisheries.  We  talked\r\n\r\nabout  agriculture just now, so this is a different\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember last year in this House the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned  mentioned that  our  fishermen\r\n\r\ncould only catch one quarter of our consumption  of\r\n\r\nfish and he thought that it was a shame. Sir, after\r\n\r\na  period  of  one  year,  has  the  Minister  done\r\n\r\nanything  in respect of promotion of fisheries!  Up\r\n\r\nto  the  present moment, fishing activities in  our\r\n\r\ncountry are declining. Although we say that we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  encourage deep-sea fishing, the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department is only providing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain  technical assistance to some  youths.  The\r\n\r\nDepartment  has not thought of ways  and  means  to\r\n\r\nencourage  people to invest in deep-sea fishing  or\r\n\r\nin  joint  ventures between the State  and  private\r\n\r\nenterprise.  So  deep-sea  fishing  activities  are\r\n\r\nstill  in  their initial stage because nothing  has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  in this respect. Off-shore  fishing  is\r\n\r\nalso   declining   because  of  deep-sea   trawlers\r\n\r\noperating along our coasts, and the Government  has\r\n\r\nnot taken adequate steps to prevent the supplies of\r\n\r\nfish  from dwindling further. Hence the decline  in\r\n\r\nour fishing activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether   the  Government  intends  to   help   our\r\n\r\nfishermen  to develop off-shore fishing or  coastal\r\n\r\nfishing.  Secondly, is the Government  prepared  to\r\n\r\nallocate  stretches  of land  along  the  coast  to\r\n\r\naccommodate   fishermen   affected   by   clearance\r\n\r\nschemes, so that they may have a place to live  and\r\n\r\nto  anchor  their fishing boats? Thirdly,  has  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  any intention of negotiating  with  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries  to  extend   our   fishing\r\n\r\ngrounds  and  to  sign an agreement  with  them  to\r\n\r\nenable  our  fishermen to fish in their territorial\r\n\r\nwaters?  I remember that before confrontation,  our\r\n\r\nfishermen  could get licences to fish in Indonesian\r\n\r\nwaters.  After confrontation, it has ceased.  So  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know whether the  Government  can,\r\n\r\nthrough   ASEAN  or  some  regional  organisations,\r\n\r\nacquire this privilege for our fishermen to fish in\r\n\r\ntheir  territorial  waters. If this  can  be  done,\r\n\r\nfishermen   who  have  strayed  into   neighbouring\r\n\r\nterritorial waters, either because of storms or  if\r\n\r\nthey are faced with difficulty and are detained  by\r\n\r\nthem,  will  be able to return to Singapore  safely\r\n\r\nand   as  early  as  possible.  Fourthly,  is   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   prepared   to  co-operate   with   our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries to eliminate  pirates  from\r\n\r\nthe high seas? I have received many complaints from\r\n\r\nfishermen  that  whenever  they  were  accosted  by\r\n\r\npirates on the high seas, they were robbed of their\r\n\r\nfishing nets, and sometimes even their motors  were\r\n\r\ntaken away and the crew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere taken as hostages until they had paid up their\r\n\r\nransom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, is the Fisheries Section of the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department  willing  to  continue  with\r\n\r\ntheir  training courses to enable our fishermen  to\r\n\r\nacquire  some  knowledge on deep-sea  fishing,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  spotting of fish in  deep  sea,  the\r\n\r\nrepair of vessels and other related subjects  since\r\n\r\nour fishermen are not so well informed about modern\r\n\r\ntechniques in deep-sea fishing? I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwill reply to all these questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid I am\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be rather long in my answer. I have  got\r\n\r\nfive  questions  which  the Member  has  taken  ten\r\n\r\nminutes  to ask. Anyway, I will do my best to  give\r\n\r\nas much information to the Member as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of licensed fishermen has\r\n\r\nincreased from 1,919 in 1970 to 2,209 in  1971.  Of\r\n\r\nthis number, 1,549 fishermen or 73 per cent of them\r\n\r\nwere  employed on inboard-powered fishing  vessels;\r\n\r\n439  fishermen  were  employed on  outboard-powered\r\n\r\nfishing  vessels, and the remaining  230  fishermen\r\n\r\nwere   employed  on  non-powered  vessels.  It   is\r\n\r\nanticipated that the number of fishermen on inboard-powered vessels will continue to increase with  the\r\n\r\ntrend  towards off-shore and deep-sea fishing.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  in-shore  fishermen  will  continue  to\r\n\r\ndecrease  in  view  of increasing industrialisation\r\n\r\nand coastal development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to fishing vessels, the number of\r\n\r\nlicences  in  1971  was  794.  There  is  a  slight\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of motorised vessels  and  a\r\n\r\ndecline  in  the number of non-powered vessels, in\r\n\r\n1971  a  total of 15,210 tons of fish were produced\r\n\r\nor  caught  by local fishermen. A total  of  38,000\r\n\r\ntons  were  imported from West Malaysia, comprising\r\n\r\nabout 80 per cent of the total fish imports. In the\r\n\r\nsame  year  1971, a total of 737 local and  foreign\r\n\r\nvessels made use of the fishing port facilities  at\r\n\r\nJurong,  landing a total of 13,716  tons  of  fish.\r\n\r\nTogether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the fish brought in by lorries from Malaysia,\r\n\r\na   total  of  nearly  53,000  tons  of  fish  were\r\n\r\nauctioned  at the Jurong Central Fish Market.  With\r\n\r\nthe  addition of one fish processing factory during\r\n\r\nthe year, the total number of factories at the port\r\n\r\nhas been increased to `four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marine Fisheries Research Department of the\r\n\r\nSouth-east   Asian  Fisheries  Development   Centre\r\n\r\nconcluded  its second year of activities  with  the\r\n\r\ncompletion of its first training course  for  seven\r\n\r\ntrainee-scientists  from the Philippines,  Vietnam,\r\n\r\nThailand and Singapore. The research vessel  Changi\r\n\r\ncompleted seven research and fishing survey cruises\r\n\r\ntotalling  93 days in the South China Sea  and  the\r\n\r\nIndian Ocean. The emphasis on these cruises was  on\r\n\r\ntrawling and oceanography. A preliminary survey  on\r\n\r\ntuna  long-line was also conducted. The reports  on\r\n\r\nthese cruises and quarterly reports on research and\r\n\r\ntraining   activities   of  the   department   were\r\n\r\ncirculated  to member countries. The staff  of  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  presented four research papers  at  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Congress of the Singapore National  Academy\r\n\r\nof Science in November 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to the training and education of\r\n\r\nfishermen,  a  batch of 21 trainees graduated  from\r\n\r\nthe  Changi Fisheries Training Centre.  This  is  a\r\n\r\njoint  project of the Singapore Government and  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations Development Programme. The trainees\r\n\r\ngraduated in September 1971 after undergoing a one-year course in marine engineering, navigation,  and\r\n\r\nfishing gear technology. March 1971 saw the arrival\r\n\r\nof  the  230 gross ton stern trawler tuna long-line\r\n\r\ntraining  vessel Jurong to join the  60  gross  ton\r\n\r\ntraining  vessel  Kangkar. Another training  course\r\n\r\ncommenced  recently. A wider field of  training  is\r\n\r\nbeing  provided  to enable a greater  diversity  in\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member is interested in aqua culture, an\r\n\r\ninvestigation  was made on the culture  of  grouper\r\n\r\nfish  in  floating  cage-nets in  selected  coastal\r\n\r\nareas.  They were stocked intensively and fed  with\r\n\r\ntrash fish. Experiments to condition them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   pelleted  feed  will  be  carried   out.   The\r\n\r\npreliminary   results   of  the   experiments   are\r\n\r\nencouraging,   but   further   investigations   are\r\n\r\nnecessary. Experiments were also conducted  on  the\r\n\r\nrearing  of  carp  in  floating  cage-nets  in  the\r\n\r\nSeletar  Reservoir. Mass production  of  the  giant\r\n\r\nfreshwater  prawn  was  successfully  carried  out.\r\n\r\nAbout  50,000  juvenile prawns were distributed  to\r\n\r\nfishpond operators on an experimental basis so that\r\n\r\nthey can rear the prawns together with the carp. If\r\n\r\nthe  Member is interested in ornamental fish, I can\r\n\r\nelaborate  further.  However,  this  is  merely  to\r\n\r\nassure  him  that the Primary Production Department\r\n\r\nis doing something for fishermen in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nappreciate  very much the bouquet he has  given  to\r\n\r\nthe  staff  of  the Primary Production  Department.\r\n\r\nHowever, he has not replied to my questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the Member's\r\n\r\nquestions  is  whether  we  intend  to   help   our\r\n\r\nfishermen.  And  I  have given  an  answer  to  his\r\n\r\nquestion as to what we are doing to help fishermen.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  a bouquet, but a whole rigmarole!  The\r\n\r\nMember  has asked mc what are we doing to encourage\r\n\r\nfishermen  to  go in for deep-sea fishing.  I  have\r\n\r\ngiven  him  particulars of  what  is  happening  at\r\n\r\nChangi.  That is what we are doing. The Member  has\r\n\r\nalso asked me what we are going to do about fishing\r\n\r\nin  foreign  waters. He should  have  directed  his\r\n\r\nquestion  to  the  Minister `for  Foreign  Affairs,\r\n\r\nbecause he deals with affairs outside Singapore. As\r\n\r\nfor  our fishermen being captured by pirates, I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  there  is  nothing the  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  can  do about affairs in  international\r\n\r\nwaters  or in foreign waters. If our fishermen  are\r\n\r\ncaught  in Singapore waters, then it is up  to  our\r\n\r\nMarine  Police  to  catch  the  pirates,  if   any.\r\n\r\nHowever,  some  of our fishermen have  been  caught\r\n\r\nthousands  of miles away from Singapore.  There  is\r\n\r\nnothing we can do to stop this.

When the\r\n\r\nfishermen are resettled from their place, they will\r\n\r\nnot  be  allocated land just because they  are  not\r\n\r\nfarmers.  Now  that many coastal  areas  have  been\r\n\r\nreclaimed  for development purposes,  they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave enough moorings for their fishing boats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all I can say in\r\n\r\nanswer  to  a general question is that, unless  the\r\n\r\nMember  gives me specific particulars, we will  not\r\n\r\nbe able to help. However, I must know where are the\r\n\r\nareas   which  they  require.  There  are   fishing\r\n\r\nfacilities in Jurong and also at Punggol.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthe few kelongs opposite the East Coast reclamation\r\n\r\nhave had to be demolished and compensation paid  to\r\n\r\nthe  fishermen affected. Therefore, to say that  we\r\n\r\nevict  fishermen without compensating them  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue and is misleading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  what has happened at Tuas Village  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency. It is a traditional fishing  village.\r\n\r\n`There are many fishermen staying there. When their\r\n\r\nland  was  taken  over for development,  they  were\r\n\r\nevicted  without being allocated land just  because\r\n\r\nthey did not belong to the category of farmers.  It\r\n\r\nmay  well  be  that  due  to  the  difficulties  of\r\n\r\ninterpretation the Minister was unable to  get  the\r\n\r\ngist of my questions and, therefore, was unable  to\r\n\r\ngive  me a satisfactory reply.

Some of them are my constituents. I  have\r\n\r\nheard  grouses from them that they are not  allowed\r\n\r\nto  use  the  public car parks, even  if  they  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to pay the usual fees. I have  been  told\r\n\r\nthat  the  existing  rules and regulations  do  not\r\n\r\npermit  taxis to be parked in the public car parks.\r\n\r\nSir,  I do not quite understand the reason for this\r\n\r\nobjection.  There  may  be  occasions   when   taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers,  either owners or hirers, may wish  to  go\r\n\r\nshopping on behalf of their wives or children. They\r\n\r\nmay  wish  to  bring their families to the  movies.\r\n\r\nThey may wish to park their taxis in some place  to\r\n\r\ngo  for  their meals or to attend to some  personal\r\n\r\naffairs.   It   is,   therefore,   illogical    and\r\n\r\nunreasonable  to  deny them parking  facilities  at\r\n\r\npublic  car  parks, not for free but on payment  of\r\n\r\nthe usual fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absurd for the taxi drivers to park their\r\n\r\ntaxis  at  the taxi-stands and then go  about  with\r\n\r\ntheir  families in other taxis or buses  to  places\r\n\r\nsome  distance away from the taxi-stands. Moreover,\r\n\r\nunder  the  law,  taxi drivers are not  allowed  to\r\n\r\nleave  their  taxis unattended in the  taxi-stands.\r\n\r\nSir, the matter of taxi-parking in public car parks\r\n\r\nwas,  in  fact, raised by the Member for  Sembawang\r\n\r\nduring  the  debate  on the Reorganisation  of  the\r\n\r\nMotor  Transport Service in September.  1970.  With\r\n\r\nyour  permission, Sir, I would like to  quote  from\r\n\r\nthe  Hansard  what the Minister for  Communications\r\n\r\nsaid.  This is found in Vol. 30, No. 5,  dated  2nd\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1970, col. 261:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Member for Sembawang has made the suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  taxis should be allowed to use car  parks.  I\r\n\r\nsee no reason why they should not be allowed if the\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers pay for it. Of course, a taxi  driver\r\n\r\ncannot just go to a public car park, parks his taxi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  free, and goes for his meal.

I\r\n\r\ncannot see the logic of it. It is a good suggestion\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am prepared to follow up with  the  party\r\n\r\nconcerned. In this respect, of course, it  is  true\r\n\r\nthat  the  Car  Parks Division is  in  a  different\r\n\r\nMinistry,  and  I  will  have  to  seek  their  co-operation to agree to this.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, I would like to find out\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister what decision  has  since  been\r\n\r\ntaken on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, under the Motor Vehicles (Parking\r\n\r\nPlaces) Rules, 1959, taxis are not allowed  to  use\r\n\r\nthe  hourly parking lots. However, this prohibition\r\n\r\nhas  been  relaxed  in certain circumstances  where\r\n\r\ntaxis  find  it necessary to park in a paid-parking\r\n\r\nlot  for  reasons  other than for plying  for  hire\r\n\r\nduring  such  periods.  Some  of  the  reasons  are\r\n\r\nletting down tourists in shopping areas and  having\r\n\r\nto wait for them; and having official business with\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments in localities  where  taxi-stands  are  not available. But when  the  rule  is\r\n\r\nrelaxed, the taxi driver takes advantage, and there\r\n\r\nare  abuses as the Member should appreciate parking\r\n\r\nattendants  have  been  instructed  to  use   their\r\n\r\ndiscretion to ensure that taxi drivers do not abuse\r\n\r\nthis privilege of using the hourly parking lots  on\r\n\r\nsome pretext to ply their taxis for hire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid I was not following the Member\r\n\r\nin  the  last few seconds of his speech.

But I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  they are necessary. We  should,  in\r\n\r\nfact, allow the taxi drivers to park their taxis at\r\n\r\npublic parking places without any restrictions.  No\r\n\r\ntaxi  driver  in his right senses would  waste  his\r\n\r\ntime in a public car park.

Recently,  I  received   a\r\n\r\ncomplaint from a friend of mine who said  that  one\r\n\r\nnight he went to the Airport to see his friend off.\r\n\r\nHe  was in a hurry and he parked his car in one  of\r\n\r\nthe parking lots. After he had seen his friend off,\r\n\r\nhe  returned  to  the parking  place  and  found  a\r\n\r\nparking  attendant.  When  he  wanted  to  pay  the\r\n\r\nparking  fee, he found out that he had  parked  his\r\n\r\ncar  in a prohibited lot. At the Airport, there are\r\n\r\nthree types of parking lots - hourly parking season\r\n\r\nparking   and  reserved  parking  lots.   But   the\r\n\r\nsignboards for the three different kinds of parking\r\n\r\nlots are all the same - blue background with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhite  lettering. If one does not pay attention  to\r\n\r\nthem,  one will make mistakes by parking in a wrong\r\n\r\nplace.  Under the circumstances, my friend  made  a\r\n\r\nmistake.  So he apologised to the parking attendant\r\n\r\nand  wanted  to pay for parking his car there.  But\r\n\r\nthe  attendant said that he could not  do  anything\r\n\r\nbecause another parking attendant had already taken\r\n\r\ndown the number of my friend's car and asked him to\r\n\r\ngo  home and wait for the summons to come.  I  have\r\n\r\ngiven this example not because I want to accuse the\r\n\r\nparking  attendant for his attitude, but because  I\r\n\r\nintend  to  request  the authorities  concerned  to\r\n\r\nconsider  using different and brighter colours  for\r\n\r\nthe  signboards for reserved and season parking  or\r\n\r\nany  other type of parking in order not to  confuse\r\n\r\nthe   public.   In  fact,  the  parking   attendant\r\n\r\nconcerned was not wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another case which I myself experienced.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, I parked my car in a parking lot  in\r\n\r\nNiven   Road.  As  I  could  not  see  any  parking\r\n\r\nattendant  around, I went off to attend to  my  own\r\n\r\nbusiness. After 20 minutes I returned to my car.  I\r\n\r\nlooked  around for a few minutes but  I  could  not\r\n\r\nlocate  the  attendant. I could not help  but  walk\r\n\r\nback  along  the  parking lots  hoping  to  find  a\r\n\r\nparking attendant. Finally, I saw one hiding behind\r\n\r\na  wooden  box on the five-foot way eating  kachang\r\n\r\nputeh. Sir, in this instance, the parking attendant\r\n\r\nshould  be considered as being negligent  of  duty.\r\n\r\nBut  we  should  not  be too  particular  about  it\r\n\r\nbecause she was the only attendant in charge of the\r\n\r\nwhole stretch of parking lots. If we want her to go\r\n\r\nup  and  down  all the time attending  to  all  the\r\n\r\nparking  lots, it would be too much  to  expect  of\r\n\r\nher. I feel that it is also a matter of shortage of\r\n\r\nstaff  and the situation is the same as in some  of\r\n\r\nthe  other car parks. I would therefore request for\r\n\r\nmore   staff  to  be  employed  by  the  Car  Parks\r\n\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, season and reserved parking lots\r\n\r\nare   differentiated   by   the   installation   of\r\n\r\nappropriate  signs,  word  markings  and   coloured\r\n\r\ndelineation lines\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  ground  in  the following  manner.

This duplication of work not only  causes\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestion  there but  also  brings  about\r\n\r\ninconvenience  to members of the  public.

As a result  of\r\n\r\nall  this, a Co-ordinating Committee was set up  to\r\n\r\nco-ordinate  the various departments  concerned  in\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of  work so as to avoid duplication  of\r\n\r\nwork.  But  it  seems  that  there  is  still  some\r\n\r\ndislocation  in  these projects.  If  the  Minister\r\n\r\ncould  take  a look into this matter,  I  shall  be\r\n\r\ngrateful.  I  would like to ask  the  Minister  why\r\n\r\nthere  still  is this phenomenon of duplication  of\r\n\r\nwork, and hope that he will be able to answer that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) I would like the Minister to consider this.\r\n\r\nUnder the flyovers or overhead bridges, stores  and\r\n\r\nshops  can be erected. We have built quite a number\r\n\r\nof  flyovers and overhead bridges, for example,  in\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh  and other places, which are  all  major\r\n\r\nprojects.  These overhead bridges  have  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nempty  space  underneath. We can make  use  of  the\r\n\r\nspace  by  putting up shops or stores and  also  to\r\n\r\nbeautify  them.  In this way we  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide more opportunities for our hawkers, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, and this is more important,  this  will\r\n\r\nbring in more revenue for the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, Singapore is known to have\r\n\r\nthe  best motoring roads in this region. Our  roads\r\n\r\nare  well-planned and built for heavy traffic;  our\r\n\r\nhighways and flyovers compare favourably with those\r\n\r\nin  the  advanced countries. Our road engineers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Works Department deserve every  praise\r\n\r\nfor  their good work. However, the patching  up  of\r\n\r\npot-holes  and  resurfacing of  some  roads,  after\r\n\r\nrepairs   to   underground   services,   are    not\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily  carried  out.  The   roads   remain\r\n\r\nuneven. Moreover the sides surrounding the manholes\r\n\r\nand  water-mains are often left unfilled for  days.\r\n\r\nIf  they are filled up later by manual labour, they\r\n\r\nare  not evenly done. So when you motor along  such\r\n\r\nroads,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyour  car  is  bound to be affected by  the  severe\r\n\r\nbumps.  In  this  respect I  would  urge  our  road\r\n\r\nengineers  to  make strict checks on either  P.W.D.\r\n\r\nworkers   or  contractors'  labourers  engaged   in\r\n\r\nresurfacing of roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another aspect of our roads which I\r\n\r\nwould like to comment on. The smooth surface of our\r\n\r\nroad  curves  or  bends is a hazard to  fast-moving\r\n\r\nvehicles,  especially on rainy days.  To  prove  my\r\n\r\npoint,  there  were two fatal accidents  some  time\r\n\r\nago.  One  involved  a bus and a  military  vehicle\r\n\r\nwhich  skidded near the Anderson Bridge. Apparently\r\n\r\nthe  tyres of these fast-moving vehicles lost their\r\n\r\ngrip  on  the road surface. To prevent skidding  of\r\n\r\nspeeding  motor vehicles, may I, Sir, as a  layman,\r\n\r\nsuggest that all road bends or curves be laid  with\r\n\r\na   rough  surface  instead  of  the  usual  smooth\r\n\r\nsurface. I notice that this rough surface has  been\r\n\r\nlaid  on  a  short stretch of the road  curve  near\r\n\r\nAnderson  Bridge. I hope the Minister will consider\r\n\r\nmy  proposal  to  have  all road  curves  or  bends\r\n\r\nrendered  with  a  rough surface to  prevent  fast-moving cars from skidding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, what the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\ncomplained  about was true some years ago.

But a few  years\r\n\r\nago we formed a Roads Co-ordination Committee, with\r\n\r\nmembers  coming from the various departments  which\r\n\r\ndig  up roads, like the Public Utilities Board, the\r\n\r\nWater,   Gas   and  Electricity  departments,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telephone  Board and  the  Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Committee meets from time to time and has laid\r\n\r\ndown certain rules -one to the effect that when  an\r\n\r\nold  road is dug up and a new road built,  all  the\r\n\r\nservices  should  be  laid in before  the  road  is\r\n\r\nfinally  asphalted. Another rule is that  any  road\r\n\r\nthat  has  been  newly surfaced cannot  be  dug  up\r\n\r\nunless there is an emergency, like a leaking  water\r\n\r\nor  gas  pipe, or a broken electricity  cable.  Co-ordination  has worked out better now in  practice,\r\n\r\nbut  is not as smooth as I would like it to be,  or\r\n\r\nas the Member for Sembawang would like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for stalls near overhead bridges, they will be\r\n\r\nallowed  under certain conditions: (1) if there  is\r\n\r\nenough  open space; (2) if the stalls do not  cause\r\n\r\nhazards  to pedestrians, motorists, and other  road\r\n\r\nusers;  (3) they do not in any way damage or  dirty\r\n\r\nthe overhead bridge, and provided the food sold  by\r\n\r\nthe  stalls,  if  they  are  food  stalls,  is  not\r\n\r\ncontaminated by dust and exhaust fumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has also complained\r\n\r\nabout defective reinstatement of trenches. This  is\r\n\r\ndue  to  the fact that someone digs up a  road  and\r\n\r\ndoes not do much about filling it up and putting it\r\n\r\nback  into  its original condition. But the  Member\r\n\r\nwill  be  pleased to know that a unit was  recently\r\n\r\nset  up  by the P.W.D. Roads Branch, headed  by  an\r\n\r\nengineer    to   co-ordinate   the   opening    and\r\n\r\nreinstatement of trenches and roads.  The  duty  of\r\n\r\nthe   unit   will   be   to  ensure   that   trench\r\n\r\nreinstatement   is  effected  by  the   departments\r\n\r\nconcerned,  or  the service departments,  to  their\r\n\r\nrequired standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Member for Mountbatten, the P.W.D, has\r\n\r\nbeen concerned about the condition of road surfaces\r\n\r\nat  certain corners and bends, especially when  the\r\n\r\nroads  are  wet. The Branch has been  experimenting\r\n\r\nwith some measure of success with a special kind of\r\n\r\nasphalt pre-mix, which has a more endurable wearing\r\n\r\nquality and a better resistance to skid.

Every encouragement should be given\r\n\r\nto  the programme to' make Singapore cool and shady\r\n\r\nand  a  city  characterised by a bland, garden  and\r\n\r\npark  atmosphere.  But a few  points  of  restraint\r\n\r\nshould  also be observed. For example, where  trees\r\n\r\nmay  have to be planted on the sides of roads, care\r\n\r\nshould  be  taken  to see that  pavements  are  not\r\n\r\nunnecessarily  ripped off and the trees  become  an\r\n\r\nimpediment to pedestrians. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\npossible,  especially in our  suburban  areas,  but\r\n\r\nincluding  those  even in town, that  people  might\r\n\r\nlike  to  go  for  a walk in the evening  or  early\r\n\r\nmorning. However, walking becomes hazardous if  one\r\n\r\nhas to constantly step down from the pavement on to\r\n\r\nthe  road  because  of trees blocking  the  way  of\r\n\r\npedestrians.  Another hazard, Sir, is the  planting\r\n\r\nof  trees at junctions, or at certain locations  by\r\n\r\nthe  roadside  which block the view of'  motorists,\r\n\r\nthereby  increasing the danger of  road  accidents.\r\n\r\nHaving  said that, Sir, I must revert once more  to\r\n\r\nmy  note of general congratulation to the Trees and\r\n\r\nParks Unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Last\r\n\r\nyear's tree planting campaign turned out to be more\r\n\r\nof  a  shrub  and foliage planting campaign.  Could\r\n\r\nthis  year's  tree  planting campaign  be  properly\r\n\r\ndirected  in line with the meaning and  purpose  of\r\n\r\nthe campaign? More fruit trees should be planted so\r\n\r\nthat  our birds will not migrate. Some of the trees\r\n\r\nplanted  in the past have grown to such  an  extent\r\n\r\nthat  it  is evident these trees are poorly pruned.\r\n\r\nSome  of  these  trees have drooping branches  that\r\n\r\nbrush  against  the top of certain  vehicles  going\r\n\r\nalong  the road and pose a danger to the people  in\r\n\r\nthe  vehicles. For example, the trees along Dunearn\r\n\r\nRoad block the lights from lamp-posts completely so\r\n\r\nmuch  so  that  the roads are not properly  lit  at\r\n\r\nnight.  This  can  cause  accidents  especially  at\r\n\r\nnight.  It is time these trees were properly pruned\r\n\r\nor the lamp-posts sited elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the\r\n\r\ncriticisms and suggestions of the two Members. They\r\n\r\ncan  barely be considered criticisms - planting  of\r\n\r\ntrees  on  side-walks or footpaths and at junctions\r\n\r\nwhich block the view of motorists, and the drooping\r\n\r\nbranches of trees which block street lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, directives have been given to this\r\n\r\neffect,  taking  into account the suggestions  that\r\n\r\nhave  just  been  made. As for tree  planting  day,\r\n\r\nMembers  will  be interested to know that  in  last\r\n\r\nyear's tree planting day on the 17th of November, a\r\n\r\ntotal  of 30,077 plants were planted, out of  which\r\n\r\n7,061  were  roadside  trees,  1,339  fruit  trees,\r\n\r\n14,330 shrubs, and 7,347 creepers or climbers. From\r\n\r\nthe  statistics, it is clear that quite a few trees\r\n\r\nwere   planted.

I have raised  this\r\n\r\nmatter in my previous amendment. But this time I am\r\n\r\ntalking  about the land. Since these buildings  are\r\n\r\noccupied by the residents, who are likely  to  stay\r\n\r\nthere  for some time, therefore, there seems to  be\r\n\r\nlittle logic in refusing to grant them permission\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   carry  out  renovations.

The  reason is that when  complaints  of\r\n\r\ndamage  to  drains and other housing amenities  are\r\n\r\nbrought to the attention of the P.W.D., they  would\r\n\r\nreply that since the certificate of fitness has not\r\n\r\nbeen  granted, nothing could be done. This  is  the\r\n\r\ncase  with my estate. I would like to know why  the\r\n\r\nWindsor  Park Estate in Thomson Road has  not  been\r\n\r\nissued  with  the certificate of fitness,  although\r\n\r\nthe houses were built 12 years ago. Will the proper\r\n\r\nauthority  look into this matter and see  that  the\r\n\r\ncertificate of fitness for the department concerned\r\n\r\nis  issued to residents of the Windsor Park  Estate\r\n\r\nas early as possible?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When private developers put up houses or erect\r\n\r\nmulti-storey  structures, they often choke  up  the\r\n\r\ndrains  around  the  building sites.  These  choked\r\n\r\ndrains become ideal mosquito breeding grounds.  Can\r\n\r\nthe  P.W.D, undertake  to repair  the  drains  and\r\n\r\ncharge the developers for the cost of repairs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, in Windsor Park Estate there is a\r\n\r\ndrain  which was damaged sometime ago. A  complaint\r\n\r\nwas lodged with the P.W.D. The reply given was that\r\n\r\nthe  estate  was  not built by the Government  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, the P.W.D, could not repair it.  I  took\r\n\r\nthis  matter  up  myself. The drain  is  behind  my\r\n\r\nneighbour's  house  as  well  as  my   house.   The\r\n\r\nsituation  is  very bad, and there  are  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmosquitoes breeding there. So I wrote a  letter  to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health and they have referred it to\r\n\r\nthe  P.W.D.  `However, the P.W.D, said it  was  not\r\n\r\ntheir responsibility, and that we should go to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore    Government   Officers'   `Co-operative\r\n\r\nHousing  Society.

Delay  in  the\r\n\r\nissue  of certificate of fitness is usually due  to\r\n\r\nnon-compliance with the requirements in one way  or\r\n\r\nanother.

Sir, I have received complaints from\r\n\r\nthe  residents of Lorong Melayu in my  constituency\r\n\r\nthat a factory had been illegally constructed. This\r\n\r\nfactory  was  erected  in a residential  area.  The\r\n\r\natmosphere  there  is now polluted  by  dust  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the work carried on in this factory.  The\r\n\r\nreply   I   received  from  the   Building   Survey\r\n\r\nDepartment  was that the structure of the  building\r\n\r\nis  made of iron, and that the Department, however,\r\n\r\nhas  no equipment to demolish it. Demolition  work,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  cannot  be carried out.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  if  houses  are owned  by  poor  people,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, they are made of planks and they would  not\r\n\r\nbe   spared  from  demolition.  This  factory   was\r\n\r\nconstructed by rich people and the material used is\r\n\r\nmade   of  iron.  Therefore,  it  is  spared   from\r\n\r\ndemolition. The building is still standing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think it is\r\n\r\na question of a building constructed by rich people\r\n\r\nor  a question of a building made of iron. However,\r\n\r\nif  what  the  Member alleges is  true,  then  that\r\n\r\nfactory should be demolished. All I can say at this\r\n\r\nstage is that I will look into this matter to  find\r\n\r\nout   why   this  unauthorised  factory  is   still\r\n\r\nstanding,  irrespective of  what  it  is  made  of.\r\n\r\nWhether it is made of iron is immaterial. And if he\r\n\r\nwishes  to  take it up further by way  of  an  Oral\r\n\r\nQuestion  I  would probably be able to provide  him\r\n\r\nwith a better answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Sometimes, however, a plan is  revoked\r\n\r\nand  money refunded. Why does it collect the  money\r\n\r\nin  the  first place if the plan would  be  revoked\r\n\r\nlater?  It  is a waste of time if a plan  is  later\r\n\r\nrevoked and the money refunded. Why is the Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment so fickle-minded about approving a plan?\r\n\r\nIf the Planning Department wishes to reject a plan,\r\n\r\nit  can  give 101 reasons for rejecting it. On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, if it wishes to approve a plan it  can\r\n\r\ngive  101  reasons for approving it. If a developer\r\n\r\nasks  for  a  development plan to be approved,  the\r\n\r\nPlanning Department will ask for the plan and  say,\r\n\r\n\"All  right, I want to see your proprietor.\"  I  do\r\n\r\nnot know why this is done. Anyway, there will be  a\r\n\r\ndelay  in  approving the plan. Surely something  is\r\n\r\nwrong  with  the Planning Department.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will reorganise the Planning  Department,\r\n\r\notherwise  there  will  be  more  complications  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there seems to be\r\n\r\nsome  confusion  in this matter.

There  is no record that  the  Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment has refunded development charges in  the\r\n\r\nmanner  cited  by  the Member for  Anson.  However,\r\n\r\nrefunds  are  made  by the Planning  Department  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of development charge deposits payable  by\r\n\r\napplicants  at  the  time of application.  This  is\r\n\r\nprovided   for   under  the  Planning  (Development\r\n\r\nCharge)  Rules, 1965. Such refunds  are  only  made\r\n\r\nwhen  the  planning permission applied for  is  not\r\n\r\ngranted or if the application is withdrawn before a\r\n\r\ndecision  is  made  on  the  application.

There  is  great  dissatisfaction\r\n\r\namong  the assistant nurses because, although  they\r\n\r\npossess  the  same qualifications  as  the  student\r\n\r\nnurses they have very little prospects of promotion\r\n\r\napart from the fact that they do not draw the  same\r\n\r\npay as the student nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another complaint. Some of the\r\n\r\nmatrons  in  the  hospitals  seem  to  be  a   very\r\n\r\nunsympathetic \"breed\" of people. Not only  do  they\r\n\r\nbully  their  junior staff but they  also  show  an\r\n\r\nindifferent   attitude  towards   them.   This   is\r\n\r\nespecially true as far as the granting of leave  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.   Perhaps  I  can  quote  a   particular\r\n\r\ninstance.  The  father of one of the nurses  passed\r\n\r\naway. Yet, the matron was so unsympathetic that she\r\n\r\nrefused  to grant the nurse a short leave in  order\r\n\r\nto recover from the shock of her father's death. In\r\n\r\nthe end, however, the nurse was granted leave by  a\r\n\r\nsympathetic ward doctor. He had to intervene in the\r\n\r\ncase  because of the unfortunate condition  of  the\r\n\r\nnurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses working on night shifts have to work for\r\n\r\nseven consecutive days, and each shift is a 10-hour\r\n\r\nduty. I think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  is  too strenuous for them. I wonder  whether\r\n\r\nshorter  working hours can be introduced for  night\r\n\r\nduty in the hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What form of co-ordination exists between the\r\n\r\nschool health doctors and the hospital authorities?\r\n\r\nQuite  often,  children recommended by  the  school\r\n\r\ndoctors for further treatment in the hospitals  are\r\n\r\nsubjected to great difficulties and humiliation  by\r\n\r\nthe  doctors in the hospitals. In a few cases  only\r\n\r\nwas  there  any  understanding between  the  school\r\n\r\ndoctors and the doctors in the hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the sole purpose of a post-mortem?\r\n\r\nIt seems that \"tough\" doctors, responsible for post-mortem,  harass the relatives of the deceased  into\r\n\r\ngiving  them permission to perform the post-mortem,\r\n\r\nfailing  which  they  even  threaten  the  grieving\r\n\r\nrelatives with delaying the release of the body for\r\n\r\nburial.  I  wish to quote the example of a  patient\r\n\r\nwho  was in hospital for more than a week and  died\r\n\r\nthere.  The  doctors could not find  the  cause  of\r\n\r\ndeath  or  the disease he was suffering  from,  and\r\n\r\nthey  insisted  on a post-mortem. The  officers  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  the mortuary deliberately  delayed  the\r\n\r\nrelease  of the body. Surely after the patient  had\r\n\r\nbeen  in hospital for more than a week, the doctors\r\n\r\nshould  have diagnosed the cause of illness,  which\r\n\r\nwould  then not cause further inconvenience to  the\r\n\r\nbereaved relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to know how long does it take\r\n\r\nfor  the authorities to collect a dead body if  the\r\n\r\nperson  dies  either on the road or on a  five-foot\r\n\r\nway?  There  are times when bodies have  been  left\r\n\r\nlying  by the side of the road for as long  as  six\r\n\r\nhours.  They  were nothing better than dogs  having\r\n\r\nbeen  knocked  down  by some vehicles.  Early  this\r\n\r\nmonth  at a place just off the Woodlands Checkpoint\r\n\r\na man died of natural causes. The body was left for\r\n\r\nexhibition  for more than six hours.  Surely  in  a\r\n\r\nprogressive-minded State like Singapore,  even  the\r\n\r\ndead should be given a certain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namount  of respect and should not be left lying  by\r\n\r\nthe  side  of  the road to rot. If  this  situation\r\n\r\nworsens,  the mortuary authorities might have  only\r\n\r\nthe bones to collect by the time they get moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to mention the case of an\r\n\r\nold lady, who is a resident in one of the Homes for\r\n\r\nthe Aged, who fell sick and was sent to the Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad General Hospital. She was warded for a day and\r\n\r\ndischarged although her condition had not improved.\r\n\r\nI  contacted  the  Medical  Superintendent  of  the\r\n\r\nHospital  and  asked  him  to  retain  her  in  the\r\n\r\nhospital.  He  replied that she was all  right  and\r\n\r\nfurthermore  there  was no  bed  available  in  the\r\n\r\nhospital. Later I contacted the Director of  Health\r\n\r\nof  the  Emergency  Unit  of  Outram  Road  General\r\n\r\nHospital,  and although I offered to  pay  for  her\r\n\r\nward  charges, he refused to ward the old lady  and\r\n\r\nasked  me  to  refer  to the Thomson  Road  General\r\n\r\nHospital. Subsequently, she was taken to the Outram\r\n\r\nRoad  General Hospital personally by her  daughter,\r\n\r\nand   she   was  immediately  admitted   with   the\r\n\r\nassistance  of a Sister. I have got  to  thank  the\r\n\r\nSister  for helping her. Now I am told the  patient\r\n\r\nhas  been  discharged from the  ward.  She  is  not\r\n\r\ncompletely cured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that patients in first- class and\r\n\r\nsecond-class  wards are allowed to stay  longer  in\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals, and be put under their  care.  This\r\n\r\npoor unfortunate old lady has been discharged,  and\r\n\r\nnow she is not well again. Why is she not given the\r\n\r\nsame treatment although her daughter had agreed  to\r\n\r\npay the ward charges? From this experience, I think\r\n\r\nthat  some of the doctors take a couldn't-care-less\r\n\r\nattitude towards M.P.s. Is this the kind of service\r\n\r\nthat Government servants can offer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to inform the House that\r\n\r\ndoctors  in  the  hospitals do not have  sufficient\r\n\r\ninstruments. For example, when a person wants to go\r\n\r\nfor  a full X-ray, he has to line up. Otherwise  he\r\n\r\nhas to go to a private doctor to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX-rayed. There are so many instruments that doctors\r\n\r\nrequire but are not available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister should look into these matters and\r\n\r\nmake the necessary arrangements to provide a better\r\n\r\nmedical service for the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Member for Anson has  enumerated\r\n\r\nabout  10 queries. I shall answer them one by  one.\r\n\r\nThe  first  query  is about Assistant  Nurses.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  why  should we continue  to  recruit\r\n\r\nAssistant  Nurses?  The answer  is  that  Assistant\r\n\r\nNurses  are of a grade different to that of Trained\r\n\r\nNurses because they do different types of jobs, the\r\n\r\ndifference  being  that the Assistant  Nurses  have\r\n\r\nlesser  responsibilities and they  work  under  the\r\n\r\nsupervision  of  the  Trained Nurses.  The  Trained\r\n\r\nNurses  are not required to work under supervision.\r\n\r\nThe  point  raised  by  the  Member  is:  why  have\r\n\r\nAssistant  Nurses  been  recruited  with  the  same\r\n\r\nqualifications  as Trained Nurses?  The  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  although  an Assistant Nurse is  required  to\r\n\r\nhave   a  minimum  education  at  Form  III  level,\r\n\r\npreference  is  given  to  those  with   a   higher\r\n\r\nqualification. Trained Nurses, however,  must  pass\r\n\r\nthe  School Certificate. What happened was that  in\r\n\r\n1967  in  a  recruitment for Assistant Nurses,  the\r\n\r\nnumber   of   applicants  with  School  Certificate\r\n\r\nqualifications  exceeded the  number  of  vacancies\r\n\r\navailable. As a result most of the Assistant Nurses\r\n\r\nrecruited  were holders of the School  Certificate,\r\n\r\nand  this  has continued since 1967.  But  we  have\r\n\r\nfound  that  because  these  Assistant  Nurses  are\r\n\r\nSchool Certificate holders there have been a  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of drop-outs. It is because of their better\r\n\r\nqualifications, they have taken up  jobs  elsewhere\r\n\r\nwhich  offer better opportunities. As a  result  of\r\n\r\nthis, the Ministry of Health has recommended to the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service Commission that the recruitment  of\r\n\r\nPupil  Nurses should now be confined to  non-School\r\n\r\nCertificate holders. I hope that will suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question that has been raised is: why\r\n\r\nare Matrons not sympathetic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople? It is important to bear  in  mind\r\n\r\nthat  one cannot tar all Matrons just because of  a\r\n\r\nparticular case; I think it is unfair. With  regard\r\n\r\nto  this  particular case of a nurse  who  was  not\r\n\r\ngiven  sympathetic consideration when  she  applied\r\n\r\nfor  leave, I must say this is the first time  that\r\n\r\nsuch a case has come to my attention. If the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  had  only been more  conscientious  and\r\n\r\nbrought this matter to my attention, it would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  thoroughly  investigated  and  any  injustice\r\n\r\nwould have been put right. The point is that it  is\r\n\r\nvery easy to make these allegations. We should have\r\n\r\nthe specific facts of the complaint and there might\r\n\r\nwell be a very good explanation to it. So I do  not\r\n\r\nthink it is fair to jump to conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is: why are nurses put on night\r\n\r\nshifts seven nights at one stretch? This matter  is\r\n\r\ndebatable.  There have been instances, particularly\r\n\r\nin the United Kingdom and other European countries,\r\n\r\nwhere  nurses  prefer a continuous seven-day  night\r\n\r\nshift.  Of  course, there are others  who  disagree\r\n\r\nwith  this. But this has been the practice for many\r\n\r\nyears  without  any complaints. Now  there  is  one\r\n\r\nschool  of  thought  which says that  a  continuous\r\n\r\nnight   shift   causes  hardship  and   is   rather\r\n\r\nstrenuous.  The  Ministry  has  looked  into   this\r\n\r\nmatter, and as a result we are proposing a new type\r\n\r\nof  night duty roster, i.e, the nurses will perform\r\n\r\nnight  duty for three consecutive nights  and  then\r\n\r\nget  a  break. May I say that this is still  in  an\r\n\r\nexperimental   stage   and,   if   it   is    found\r\n\r\nsatisfactory, we might make this a general rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point concerns school health doctors\r\n\r\nand  their co-ordination with the hospitals. May  I\r\n\r\nsay to the Member for Anson that there is close co-ordination between the two services. I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhy he has brought up this complaint about lack  of\r\n\r\nco-ordination. This again is the first complaint of\r\n\r\nits  kind that I have heard. Of course, there might\r\n\r\nbe cases where there could he some misunderstanding\r\n\r\nbetween the two services. But I can assure him that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  is  close  co-ordination.  If  he  has   any\r\n\r\nparticular  complaint, he should  not  hesitate  to\r\n\r\nbring it to my attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also raised a question on\r\n\r\npost-mortem.  May  I  tell him  that  it  is  quite\r\n\r\nessential  for the advancement of medical knowledge\r\n\r\nthat there should be post-mortem, because diagnosis\r\n\r\nis  not  always a certainty and knowledge is gained\r\n\r\nthrough  post-mortem. However, let me say  that  no\r\n\r\none  can  be  forced to consent  to  a  post-mortem\r\n\r\nagainst his wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that the Member for Anson raised\r\n\r\nis   about  the  collection  of  dead  bodies  from\r\n\r\nroadsides and other public places. May I  tell  him\r\n\r\nthat  the  responsibility for  the  collection  and\r\n\r\ntransport  of a dead body from a road  accident  is\r\n\r\ngenerally  undertaken by the Fire Brigade ambulance\r\n\r\nor  the  Police  and  not the  ambulance  from  the\r\n\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the case of the old lady, here again\r\n\r\nthis is the first time I hear of this case. If only\r\n\r\nthe Member has written to me on this, of course, it\r\n\r\nwould have been looked into. May I point out that a\r\n\r\nsingle  case cannot possibly mean that the  doctors\r\n\r\nor  the  medical superintendents are unsympathetic.\r\n\r\nThe  point is that we must have specific  facts  so\r\n\r\nthat  an  investigation can be undertaken  and  the\r\n\r\nmatter put right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained about insufficiency of\r\n\r\ninstruments in the general hospitals. As far as our\r\n\r\nofficers  are  concerned - and  they  are  handling\r\n\r\nequipment  everyday - the instruments and equipment\r\n\r\nused  are considered adequate for day-to-day needs.\r\n\r\nThe  point  I  can admit here is that some  of  our\r\n\r\nequipment is quite old, and that is the reason  why\r\n\r\nwe  have requested the Ministry of Finance  to  up-date all the equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This request for finance has been approved, and\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of over $l\ufffd million has been  provided\r\n\r\nfor the up-dating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand replacement of existing equipment,  over\r\n\r\nand  above that provided in the Ordinary Estimates.\r\n\r\nSo the Member for Anson will in the future see that\r\n\r\nmore up to-date equipment are in use in hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nasked  me  to put up a separate complaint for  each\r\n\r\ncase. There is no doubt that if I were to put up  a\r\n\r\nseparate case for complaint, I will only receive  a\r\n\r\nreply  saying it is \"regretted\", \"denied\",  \"to  be\r\n\r\nconsidered\",  or  \"next  time  it  will   be   very\r\n\r\ncarefully considered\". Therefore, I do not want  to\r\n\r\nbring  these cases to the Ministry but to bring  it\r\n\r\nup  to  the House. But I am sure the Minister  will\r\n\r\nlook  into  these  matters  properly  and  will  do\r\n\r\nsomething  about them. I, therefore, beg  leave  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $16,412,890 for Head 1201 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1202 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Why is this so? I also understand\r\n\r\nthat  the  food  supplied to the  patients  is  not\r\n\r\nproper,  and the plates and cups appear to be  very\r\n\r\nunhygienic. Can this matter be looked into?  May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  more first class, second  class  and\r\n\r\nthird  class wards should be created as the  demand\r\n\r\nfor  beds  is greater than the supply available  in\r\n\r\nthese wards?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays medical authorities are aware of the\r\n\r\nlatest  medical  treatment  of  children.  In   the\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries of Europe and America,  parents\r\n\r\nare  allowed  to  stay with their children  in  the\r\n\r\nchildren's  ward so as to facilitate the  treatment\r\n\r\nof the children. It has been found that in this way\r\n\r\nchildren recover faster. Further, parents are able\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto relieve the doctors and nurses of their tiresome\r\n\r\nchores.  It is time the Ministry of Health  allowed\r\n\r\nparents  or close relatives to stay close to  their\r\n\r\nchildren, thereby reducing the length of  stay  for\r\n\r\nthe  children  in  hospitals. In  this  respect,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  a  common rest room for  parents  or\r\n\r\nclose relatives be set up so that they can be  near\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, let me first take the\r\n\r\npoint about beds being put in the verandah on the C-class ward. The answer is quite simple. If we  find\r\n\r\nthat  there  are no beds available but the  patient\r\n\r\nmust be admitted, of course, we have to put him  on\r\n\r\nthe  verandah.  It is because of  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\nbeds.  However, as a result of the taking  over  of\r\n\r\nthe  Alexandra  Hospital, this  situation  has  not\r\n\r\noccurred so often.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about the plates in the C-class ward. There is an allegation that some of the\r\n\r\nplates  are  broken. May I say that the plates  for\r\n\r\nthe C-class patients are not made of porcelain.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  they are steel plates. So it is not possible\r\n\r\nfor them to break.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another matter raised by the Member concerns\r\n\r\nthe  treatment of children. I agree with the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson that it is best you allow the parents  to\r\n\r\ncome  along  to  stay with their  children  in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals.  In  this way they can also  look  after\r\n\r\ntheir  children, and the children will not  have  a\r\n\r\ntraumatic experience of being taken away from their\r\n\r\nparents.  As far as it is feasible, this  has  been\r\n\r\nthe  practice. In fact, this has been done  in  the\r\n\r\nMistri  Wing  of the Outram Road General  Hospital.\r\n\r\nBut  because of physical impossibility that has not\r\n\r\nbeen  the general practice. First of all,  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  got a sleeping room for parents in the  Mistri\r\n\r\nWing  of  Outram Road General Hospital. Of  course,\r\n\r\nthere  are no facilities for them to sleep in,  but\r\n\r\nthere is a common room there which can be used  for\r\n\r\nthis  purpose.  But  now that  we  have  plans  for\r\n\r\nrebuilding the hospital, this matter will certainly\r\n\r\nbe  taken  into  account. As far as  the  Alexandra\r\n\r\nHospital is concerned, the children's ward has such\r\n\r\nfacilities. The parents can also stay in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  we do allow parents in certain cases  to\r\n\r\nremain with the children in the various wards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The third class ward  has\r\n\r\nswing  doors  which  are  either  badly  dented  or\r\n\r\ndamaged. Yet nothing has been done about it.  These\r\n\r\ndoors have panels made of metal, but they are  torn\r\n\r\nand  become a source of danger to the patients, the\r\n\r\nnurses and the amahs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out to the Minister\r\n\r\nthe  discrimination  that  exists  in  the  Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau  Hospital. The third class patients are  not\r\n\r\nserved with proper food. What is worse is that  the\r\n\r\nnurses  and amahs treat the patients very badly.  I\r\n\r\nalways   support  the  Government   servants,   but\r\n\r\nwherever possible I would ask the Minister to  take\r\n\r\naction. Quite often the nurses and amahs make  rude\r\n\r\nremarks  about certain patients in front  of  other\r\n\r\npatients. What is worse is that they shout  at  the\r\n\r\npatients if the patients are unfortunate enough  to\r\n\r\nrequire  any  assistance. Such practice  should  be\r\n\r\nstopped  immediately.  The  nurses  and  amahs  are\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants.  As  such  they   should   be\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with  Government  regulations.  There  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely no excuse for these Government  servants\r\n\r\nto  behave  like demi-gods. I know  the  amahs  and\r\n\r\nnurses   in  the  hospital  are  very  hardworking.\r\n\r\nHowever,  they  must carry out their duty  properly\r\n\r\nand not be rude to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I first take the\r\n\r\nallegation  that  there has been discrimination  by\r\n\r\nnurses  and  amahs  against  C-class  patients   in\r\n\r\nKandang Kerbau Hospital? I say again that it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrather  unfair  on the part of the Member  to  make\r\n\r\nsuch a general allegation.

The point is that I think it is  rather\r\n\r\nunfair to make a general allegation and thereby tar\r\n\r\nthe good name of the amahs and nurses in particular\r\n\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

There  is always a black  sheep  in  any\r\n\r\nflock.  As I have always stated, it is our duty  to\r\n\r\nsee  who is the black sheep and appropriate  action\r\n\r\nwill  be taken. I think it is rather unfair to just\r\n\r\ntar  the  others  because of the misdeeds  of  one.\r\n\r\nBesides,  the Ministry of Health makes it  a  point\r\n\r\nthat  all nurses, doctors and amahs have name  tags\r\n\r\non  them. So it is not an impersonal service; it is\r\n\r\na  personal service. You can personalise those  who\r\n\r\nhave done good and those who have been at fault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about metal doors.

Industrial hygiene is concerned with the\r\n\r\nmeasurement, assessment and control of the  working\r\n\r\nenvironment relating to factors that could lead  to\r\n\r\nindustrial   disease   and   illnesses.   In    the\r\n\r\nestablishment there is no such title as \"Industrial\r\n\r\nHygienist\",  and  so  the closest  nomenclature  is\r\n\r\n\"Inspector  of Factories\", which has been  used  as\r\n\r\nthe  basic qualification. The salary scale  for  an\r\n\r\nIndustrial Hygienist and an Inspector of  Factories\r\n\r\nis the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Inspectors of Factories in the\r\n\r\nFactory  Inspectorate  are concerned  largely  with\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents and safety measures  and  not\r\n\r\nwith  industrial diseases.

Very often,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  insufficient bins at these  collection\r\n\r\npoints,  rubbish spills over to the  road,  thereby\r\n\r\nproducing   not  only  a  strong   odour   in   the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood,   but   also   providing   excellent\r\n\r\nbreeding   grounds   for   rats,   mosquitoes   and\r\n\r\ncockroaches. Surely by providing a few more bins at\r\n\r\nthese centres we are not going to tax the commoners\r\n\r\nmore.  The  Public Health Department officials  can\r\n\r\nsurely  take  a little more action in this  regard.\r\n\r\nThe  \"Keep Singapore Clean and Green\" campaign will\r\n\r\nbecome pointless if one of our Ministries becomes a\r\n\r\nspecialist in breeding rats!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Health does not breed  rats!\r\n\r\nBut  if we do breed them, they are white mice  used\r\n\r\nfor  experiments. Regarding the other  point  about\r\n\r\ninsufficiency of bins at the bin centres, as far as\r\n\r\nwe are concerned there are sufficient bins at these\r\n\r\ncentres.  The problem is that at peak periods  like\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  New Year, or just before the  season,\r\n\r\neverybody  does spring cleaning, and  they  discard\r\n\r\njust about every old stuff so that they can buy new\r\n\r\nitems, like furniture and so on. That is the reason\r\n\r\nwhy  rubbish  during those periods  has  piled  up.\r\n\r\nThese    are   periodic   instances   of    rubbish\r\n\r\naccumulating in excess of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnormal  volume  because of certain  habits  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.

But in such cases  it  is  usually\r\n\r\nremoved  on  that evening or the next day.

This may\r\n\r\nbe  the  result of the failure on the part  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Health Department officials  to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  duties  properly.  Sometimes  the  residents\r\n\r\nthemselves  clean the drains because  they  do  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  see the dirty and smelly drains.  Workers\r\n\r\nfrom  the Public Health Department do the cleansing\r\n\r\nwork  from time to time. But this is unsatisfactory\r\n\r\nbecause the number of workers engaged in such  work\r\n\r\nis insufficient and time is also limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to suggest that more anti-malarial oil he\r\n\r\npumped into the stagnant water as it is one of  the\r\n\r\nways  to  reduce mosquito breeding in the  area.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve   if  this  problem  is  looked  into   and\r\n\r\nresolved,   mosquito  breeding  will   be   greatly\r\n\r\nreduced, thus providing a better health environment\r\n\r\nfor the residents there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a\r\n\r\nperennial problem. It has been brought up again and\r\n\r\nagain since last year. The Member for Geylang Serai\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas given us his version of the problem. But as far\r\n\r\nas the Ministry of Health is concerned, we have our\r\n\r\nown  version of the problem which I shall  explain.\r\n\r\nThis  problem has arisen fundamentally because  the\r\n\r\nwhole area is a low-lying area. The drainage of the\r\n\r\narea consists of a vast network of earth drains and\r\n\r\nthe  gradient  is so slight that the water  becomes\r\n\r\nsluggish  and,  in  many cases, stagnant.  In  some\r\n\r\nplaces  the matter is aggravated because of silting\r\n\r\nof  these  drains  when  it rains.  The  result  of\r\n\r\nstagnant  water,  of course, is mosquito  breeding.\r\n\r\nMay  I  inform  the Member for Geylang  Serai  that\r\n\r\nunfortunately some of the residents also contribute\r\n\r\nto  the problem by throwing refuse into the drains.\r\n\r\nThere  are some civic-conscious residents who  help\r\n\r\nto clean the drains, and at the same time there are\r\n\r\nthose  who  are not so civic-conscious. They  throw\r\n\r\nrubbish into the drains and worsen the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that we can only solve this fundamental\r\n\r\nproblem by redeveloping the whole area, because  it\r\n\r\nis  not  possible  to make water flow  upwards,  as\r\n\r\nwater  flows from a higher level to a lower  level.\r\n\r\nIf  the outlets are at a higher level than that  of\r\n\r\nthe drain, then you cannot solve the problem unless\r\n\r\nyou   raise  the  level  of  the  whole  area   and\r\n\r\nreconstruct  the whole drainage system.  Meanwhile,\r\n\r\nwhatever can be done to alleviate the situation has\r\n\r\nbeen  done.  The Ministry of Health and the  P.W.D.\r\n\r\nare   responsible  for  the  maintenance  of  these\r\n\r\ndrains,  and  the following action has been  taken.\r\n\r\nThere  has  been regular oiling of the drains,  but\r\n\r\nthe  drawback is that if you oil it in the  morning\r\n\r\nand  it  rains  in  the  afternoon,  the  oil  will\r\n\r\nliterally  go  down  the drain. Now,  the  relevant\r\n\r\ndepartment  has also been desilting the  drains  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  possible, and any overgrown weeds on  both\r\n\r\nsides  of the drain are being cleared once  in  two\r\n\r\nmonths.  If  the  Member for  Geylang  Serai  would\r\n\r\nexhort  the residents in his area to be more civic-conscious and not to throw rubbish into the  drains\r\n\r\nbut  into  proper  dustbins,  then  of  course  the\r\n\r\nsituation will improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd.

May I then  know  when\r\n\r\nwill  the development take place? However,  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime, the Public Health Division must carry out\r\n\r\ntheir     daily    work    conscientiously    until\r\n\r\nredevelopment takes place.

In fact,\r\n\r\nfor  the  last six months Public Health  Inspectors\r\n\r\nhave  been  visiting an average of over a  thousand\r\n\r\nhomes a week, and weekly statements of incidents of\r\n\r\nmosquito breeding have been issued to the press  in\r\n\r\norder  to  exhort  members of the  public  to  take\r\n\r\npreventive  measures  within  their  own  premises.\r\n\r\nAlso,  we make mention in the weekly statements  of\r\n\r\nthe  number of notices and summonses issued against\r\n\r\nhouseholders who have not been civic enough to take\r\n\r\nprecautionary measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, may I inform the Member [or Anson that,\r\n\r\nalthough  he  mentioned  the  mosquito  menace   in\r\n\r\ngeneral, it has been found that the major source of\r\n\r\nbreeding  is  within private premises  in  built-up\r\n\r\nareas  such  as residential estates,  like  Windsor\r\n\r\nPark.  Perhaps  this  will be of  interest  to  the\r\n\r\nMember, who is also the President of the Residents'\r\n\r\nAssociation  in Windsor Park.

A survey on the\r\n\r\nincidence of mosquitoes was conducted, and it shows\r\n\r\nthat  with the exception of a septic tank, all  the\r\n\r\nseven  breeding sites were within private premises.\r\n\r\nOf course, the responsibility for the prevention of\r\n\r\nmosquito  breeding  in septic tank  lies  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

We have also  advised\r\n\r\nthe factory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanagement to confine their operations to  daylight\r\n\r\nhours,  and  not  to operate it during  the  night.\r\n\r\nCourt  action  has  also  been  taken  against  the\r\n\r\nmanagement for dumping refuse into the drain on two\r\n\r\noccasions. But as I have said, we can only issue  a\r\n\r\nnuisance notice if there is any nuisance.  In  this\r\n\r\nparticular case, when our inspectors went on  their\r\n\r\nrounds  they  did  not find any  evidence  of  dust\r\n\r\nnuisance and as a result, no, nuisance notice could\r\n\r\nbe  served. Of course, as I have said, the quickest\r\n\r\nway to deal with this matter is to get a demolition\r\n\r\norder to pull the factory down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd.
