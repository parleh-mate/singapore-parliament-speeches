Patrols  are\r\n\r\ncarried  out  twice a day by Social Welfare  officers.\r\n\r\nThis  has been done since 1965. For the 10-year period\r\n\r\nfrom 1965 to 1974, an average of about 300 beggars per\r\n\r\nyear  were contacted by the Social Welfare Department.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  1975  the  number of  beggars  contacted\r\n\r\ndropped  to  202. In the first quarter of  1976  there\r\n\r\nwere  only  43. These figures indicate that  far  from\r\n\r\nthere  being an increase in the number of  beggars  in\r\n\r\npublic places, there has been a drop in number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beggars who are found to be destitutes are admitted\r\n\r\ninto the Department's Homes for the Destitutes if they\r\n\r\nneed  shelter  and care. The aim of admitting  beggars\r\n\r\ninto  such homes is not just to accommodate them.  The\r\n\r\nreal  objective is to provide them with some  training\r\n\r\nfor  those who can be trained and thus enable them  to\r\n\r\ntake up employment and return to independent living in\r\n\r\nthe  society.  Unfortunately, the number  who  can  be\r\n\r\nhelped in this way is hopelessly small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also point out that a number of beggars or\r\n\r\napparently destitute persons do have families who, for\r\n\r\none  reason  or  another, do not wish  to  assume  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  their care. The  biggest  problem\r\n\r\nthat  the  Social  Welfare  Department  faces  is   in\r\n\r\nmotivating  their families to take care of  them.  The\r\n\r\npolicy  has  been that, wherever it is possible,  such\r\n\r\ndestitute  persons will be discharged to the  care  of\r\n\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CIGARETTE SMOKING BY YOUTHS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Prohibition)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for Law and the\r\n\r\nEnvironment, as cigarette\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmoking  is considered dangerous to health  and  anti-social, if he will consider introducing legislation to\r\n\r\nprohibit  the smoking of cigarette by youths  below  a\r\n\r\ncertain age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

From its provisions  flow  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  other  important provisions  which  enable\r\n\r\ninferences  to be drawn from the accused's failure  to\r\n\r\nmention  relevant  facts when  charged  and  from  his\r\n\r\nfailure to give evidence when or should his defence be\r\n\r\ncalled upon. The Law Society of Singapore, noting that\r\n\r\nthe  abovementioned provisions introduced a completely\r\n\r\nnew  concept  in the administration of justice,  added\r\n\r\nthat  in  principle  it  supported  this  concept  but\r\n\r\nrecommended   certain   safeguards.   Some   of    the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Law Society were  accepted  and\r\n\r\nthe  original  Bill has been amended accordingly.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, the proviso to subsection (5) of section 121\r\n\r\nof  the Criminal Procedure Code appearing in clause  5\r\n\r\nof  the Bill has been amended to remove the discretion\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  court to refuse to admit  a  statement\r\n\r\nobtained by inducement, threat or promise. The  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee also deleted from clause 6 of the  Bill  the\r\n\r\nprovision enabling adverse inferences to be drawn from\r\n\r\nthe  accused's  failure to state relevant  facts  when\r\n\r\nquestioned  by a police officer before he  is  charged\r\n\r\nwith an offence or officially informed that he may  be\r\n\r\nprosecuted for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acting on the recommendation of the Law Society the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee amended the original Bill to make\r\n\r\ninadmissible hearsay statements made after the\r\n\r\ncommencement of investigations to prevent people\r\n\r\nfabricating evidence. Another amendment made extended\r\n\r\nthe safeguards contained in subsection (2) of the\r\n\r\nproposed new section 371 D to trials in the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts so that, without the leave of the\r\n\r\ncourt, hearsay statements may not be given in evidence\r\n\r\nat trials before the High Court as well as before the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts unless a notice containing the\r\n\r\nrequired information has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserved  on the other parties to the proceedings within\r\n\r\nthe prescribed time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, due weight was given to every\r\n\r\nrepresentation received and if any recommendation  was\r\n\r\nnot  accepted, the Select Committee had  good  reasons\r\n\r\nfor rejecting it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EVIDENCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.
