A complete review of electoral\r\n\r\nboundaries   will  be  undertaken   as   soon   as\r\n\r\ncompilation  of  new citizens electoral  registers\r\n\r\nfor 1967 based on the new laminated identity cards\r\n\r\nis  completed. Registration of persons which began\r\n\r\nin  May  last year has just ended. Preparation  of\r\n\r\nnew electoral registers with the correct addresses\r\n\r\nof  citizens  eligible to vote shown therein  will\r\n\r\nbegin soon, and the review of electoral boundaries\r\n\r\nwill be undertaken in the light of the information\r\n\r\ncontained in the new registers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the names which appeared in the\r\n\r\nelectoral registers included all persons who  held\r\n\r\nSingapore  identity cards irrespective of  whether\r\n\r\nthey  were  citizens or not. An amendment  to  the\r\n\r\nElections  Ordinance  will soon  be  presented  to\r\n\r\nenable  only citizens to vote. It stands to reason\r\n\r\nthat,  with  such a revision, electoral boundaries\r\n\r\nmust  be  redrawn  so that the average  number  of\r\n\r\nelectorate   in   all   constituencies   will   be\r\n\r\napproximately  the same. The creation  of  housing\r\n\r\nestates  in  many  areas  and  resettlement  of  a\r\n\r\nsection  of  the  population have also  made  this\r\n\r\nrevision necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TIME OFF FOR MILITARY TRAINING</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Deduction of pay)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister of\r\n\r\nDefence if he is aware that some employers  deduct\r\n\r\nthe  pay  of their workers who take time  off  for\r\n\r\ntraining\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin   one   of   the   military  or   para-military\r\n\r\norganisations;  and  whether  and  what  steps  he\r\n\r\nproposes  to  take  to ensure  that  no  employees\r\n\r\nsuffer   any  loss  merely  by  reason  of   their\r\n\r\nvoluntary participation in such organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   the  training  undergone  by  the  People's\r\n\r\nDefence   Force   volunteers   comprises   evening\r\n\r\nparades,  weekend  camps or  training  and  annual\r\n\r\ncamps.  The evening parades are held after  office\r\n\r\nhours.  Similarly  the weekend camps  or  training\r\n\r\nheld  at weekend camps hardly interferes with  the\r\n\r\ncivilian  work of such volunteers. In cases  where\r\n\r\nthe  evening  parades interfere with  the  working\r\n\r\nhours of the volunteers, the officers in charge of\r\n\r\nthe  training depots usually request the employers\r\n\r\nconcerned that the volunteers he allowed to  leave\r\n\r\ntheir work early. At present, however, there is no\r\n\r\nlaw compelling the employers to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question raised by the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah,  therefore, really relates to the  annual\r\n\r\ncamp.  When  they  attend such  annual  camp,  the\r\n\r\nvolunteers are given the same rate of military pay\r\n\r\nas  their  regular  counterparts of  corresponding\r\n\r\nrank.  Attention has recently been  drawn  to  the\r\n\r\ncases  of daily-rated employees who are unable  to\r\n\r\nget  time off for attending annual camp and  whose\r\n\r\ncivilian pay is greater than the military pay that\r\n\r\nthey  would draw in attending annual camp. To meet\r\n\r\nthe  problem,  it has been decided  that  in  such\r\n\r\ncases a special allowance up to a maximum of $2.50\r\n\r\nper day may be paid for the difference between the\r\n\r\ncivilian  and military pay. There are  448  daily-rated employees in the People's Defence Force, and\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of  240 attended annual  camp  last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration is being given to making legal\r\n\r\nprovision to cover such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add that in respect of Government\r\n\r\nemployees,  both the monthly paid and  the  daily-rated, there are provisions for granting them full\r\n\r\npay leave for a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain  number  of days a year  for  purposes  of\r\n\r\nattending    volunteer   camps    of    recognised\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> A supplementary, Sir.

The area is low  lying  with  a\r\n\r\ntidal  creek running through the area, so that  it\r\n\r\nis  subject  to periodic flooding when heavy  rain\r\n\r\ncoincides with the tides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, the environmental health\r\n\r\nof  Covent Gardens, as in other kampongs similarly\r\n\r\nsituated  elsewhere in Singapore, is bad.

But when the fire catastrophe occurred at\r\n\r\nthe  latter  site  in May 1961,  redevelopment  of\r\n\r\nBukit Ho Swee was proceeded with apace, and Covent\r\n\r\nGardens unfortunately remains what it is today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent survey of Covent Gardens, which by the\r\n\r\nway  has  no  Street sign at all to  indicate  its\r\n\r\nexistence whether access is from Kim Seng Road  or\r\n\r\nHavelock Road, revealed that there are about 2,500\r\n\r\npersons  living  in a little over  100  houses  of\r\n\r\nattap  or  zinc construction. Of these, 33  houses\r\n\r\nare  built on stilts over the tidal creek or fore-shore  of  the river. As only half of  the  houses\r\n\r\nhave  latrines, and only 23 use the bucket system,\r\n\r\nthe  majority,  therefore, have to resort  to  the\r\n\r\nprimitive  method  of easing themselves  over  the\r\n\r\ntidal   creek   or   the  river  with   consequent\r\n\r\npollution. Poultry and pigs are even being  reared\r\n\r\nin  about one-half of these houses. As drains  are\r\n\r\ngenerally  earth drains, with refuse being  dumped\r\n\r\nindiscriminately into drains and on to  footpaths,\r\n\r\nthe maintenance of public cleansing was almost  an\r\n\r\nimpossible  task with only one public  daily-rated\r\n\r\nworker  being  assigned to  perform  the  task  of\r\n\r\nrefuse  clearance of this area, which  includes  a\r\n\r\nsmall private market as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mosquito breeding is extensive because of water-collecting junk lying everywhere and with stagnant\r\n\r\nwater in drains and pools.

In view of this,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthere  will be an early hearing of the legal suits\r\n\r\ninstituted  by  Professor Tinckler,  so  that  the\r\n\r\ntruth  as to whether the Ministry of Health  acted\r\n\r\nproperly  in the public interests or that  he  was\r\n\r\nunfairly maligned can be properly established in a\r\n\r\ncourt  of law.

A draft Ordinance is now being\r\n\r\nprepared,  embodying these new incentives  in  the\r\n\r\nlegislation, and when completed, further publicity\r\n\r\nwill  he  given to these incentives  to  both  the\r\n\r\nlocal and foreign business and industrial centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, purely on the very brief outline of the\r\n\r\nincentives  given in the Budget Speech alone,  the\r\n\r\nEconomic   Development  Board   has   reported   a\r\n\r\nsignificant increase in industrial inquiries  made\r\n\r\nboth  at  the  Singapore Office  as  well  as  its\r\n\r\noverseas  offices.  There  were  a  total  of  180\r\n\r\nindustrial  inquiries on record for  1966,  or  an\r\n\r\naverage  of  15 inquiries a month. In  almost  the\r\n\r\nfirst  2  months  of this year (only  up  to  23rd\r\n\r\nFebruary),  there  were  already  a  total  of  46\r\n\r\ninquiries, or an average of 23 inquiries a  month.\r\n\r\nThese  were  from  local as well as  international\r\n\r\ncorporations  which have indicated interest  in  a\r\n\r\nwide range of industries, ranging from electronics\r\n\r\nto  petrochemicals. Some of the proposals  involve\r\n\r\nlarge sums of investments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These inquiries reflect an almost 50 per cent\r\n\r\nincrease per month. This increase in inquiries for\r\n\r\nthe  months  of  January  and  February  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved  in  spite of many public holidays.  From\r\n\r\nthe  serious manner in which these inquiries  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made,  the  Economic  Development  Board  is\r\n\r\nconfident  that  many of these projects  would  be\r\n\r\ncarried beyond the mere inquiry stage and would be\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be pointed out that in all developing\r\n\r\ncountries  there  is  always  a  gestation  period\r\n\r\nbetween  the  introduction of incentives  and  the\r\n\r\nachievements  of  full  impact  on  the   national\r\n\r\neconomy.  It  takes two or three years  to  get  a\r\n\r\nlarge  industrial enterprise into  full  operation\r\n\r\neven  if the final decision is made today.

The freehold title in the land above\r\n\r\nwhich the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nflat is built is either retained by the vendor who\r\n\r\nimposes  on  each of his lessees a service  charge\r\n\r\nfor  the  maintenance of common parts and property\r\n\r\nor  is  conveyed in proportionate  shares  to  the\r\n\r\npurchasers  of  all flats built  on  the  land  as\r\n\r\ntenants in common. Experience has shown that it is\r\n\r\ndifficult for tenants to get together and problems\r\n\r\narise  when lifts break down or pipes burst.  This\r\n\r\nrather unsatisfactory state of affairs has impeded\r\n\r\nthe  development and sale of flats in the Republic\r\n\r\nand  the Bill now before the House, which is based\r\n\r\non  Australian legislation, takes account  of  the\r\n\r\ncomments of the former Bar Committee and seeks  to\r\n\r\nremove these difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill introduces a strata land register under\r\n\r\nwhich the proprietor of registered land on which a\r\n\r\nbuilding  stands,  who  has obtained  approval  of\r\n\r\nsubdivision  of the building into flats  from  the\r\n\r\ncompetent authority, may apply to the Registrar of\r\n\r\nTitles  for  the land and the subdivided  building\r\n\r\nthereon  to  be dealt with in lots under  separate\r\n\r\nsubsidiary strata certificates of title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also spells out the rights and\r\n\r\nobligations  of  the  purchasers  of  flats  in  a\r\n\r\nsubdivided   building   as  regards   assessments,\r\n\r\neasements and restrictive covenants. The owner  or\r\n\r\nowners of flats comprised in a subdivided building\r\n\r\nshown  in  a strata title plan lodged in the  Land\r\n\r\nTitles   Registry  will  become   the   management\r\n\r\ncorporation of the building as soon as such strata\r\n\r\ntitle  plan  has  been registered. The  management\r\n\r\ncorporation, consisting of all the flat owners, is\r\n\r\nmade  responsible  for the maintenance  of  common\r\n\r\nparts like lifts and corridors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of this Bill. How  to  convey  a\r\n\r\nflat  and give the purchaser legal title has  long\r\n\r\nbeen    exercising   the   ingenuity   of    legal\r\n\r\npractitioners. As you yourself know, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  common law the legal owner of land  owns\r\n\r\nalso the air\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspace  above the land. He also owns any  permanent\r\n\r\nstructure  built upon the land. Ti is,  therefore,\r\n\r\ndifficult in common law to give legal title to the\r\n\r\npurchaser of a flat which occupies only  some  air\r\n\r\nspace  above a plot of land. There is  no  way  of\r\n\r\ngiving  him legal title to that air space.  Common\r\n\r\nlaw does not provide for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conveyancing lawyers have devised ways and means\r\n\r\nof  overcoming  this problem. To a  large  extent,\r\n\r\nthey  have  been  successful and flats  have  been\r\n\r\nbought  and  sold. But, as the Minister  has  just\r\n\r\npointed out, because of certain common parts  that\r\n\r\nare  relative to the flats, the ownership of which\r\n\r\nis  not anybody's, the maintenance of these common\r\n\r\nparts  has  generally  not  been  taken  care  of.\r\n\r\nConsequently  this  is one of the  discouragements\r\n\r\nfor    flat   owners.   There   is   the   further\r\n\r\ndiscouragement  that there is always  the  nagging\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  the purchaser may not get  a  perfect\r\n\r\ntitle   to  the  flat,  especially  when  disaster\r\n\r\nhappens  and the flat is destroyed. This doubt,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  can  be clearly seen in the reluctance  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  societies  and  insurance  companies  to\r\n\r\nfinance  the  buying  of  flats,  although   these\r\n\r\nfinance organisations are quite willing to finance\r\n\r\nthe buying of other forms of landed property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, flat dwelling is a phenomenon\r\n\r\nof  our  modern over-crowded cities.  Most  modern\r\n\r\ncities are experiencing a grave shortage of  land.\r\n\r\nThis  is  especially true of Singapore  where  the\r\n\r\ntotal land area is less than 250 square miles. We,\r\n\r\ntherefore, build upwards instead of sideways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law on land, however, has not kept pace with\r\n\r\nmodern development. We have inherited a law  which\r\n\r\nwas  made  at  a time when land was plentiful  and\r\n\r\nthere  was  neither the economic  nor  the  social\r\n\r\npressure  to build flats. This pressure,  however,\r\n\r\nis  present  in Singapore to a tremendous  extent.\r\n\r\nSpace   is  at  a  premium,  and  for  the  better\r\n\r\nutilisation  of  space we in  Singapore  not  only\r\n\r\nbuild flats for dwelling purposes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(with which this Bill is mainly concerned), hut we\r\n\r\nalso  have schools in multi-storey structures.  We\r\n\r\nhave multi-storey car parks and flatted factories.\r\n\r\nI  remember  during an adjournment debate  not  so\r\n\r\nlong  ago  on  the  resettlement of  farmers,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Defence  even  suggested  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment should consider flatted structures  for\r\n\r\nthe rearing of pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
