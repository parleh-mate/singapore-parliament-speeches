It makes no difference to them  at\r\n\r\nthis stage of the fight for freedom whether the P.A.P\r\n\r\nis     Communist    or    non-Communist.    We    are\r\n\r\nuncompromisingly  anti-colonial  and  we  expect  the\r\n\r\ncolonial power to be uncompromisingly anti-P.A.P. But\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  understand  the  Labour  Front  Coalition\r\n\r\njoining the colonial power in seeking to destroy  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. It is true we have little time or respect  for\r\n\r\nmany of the political rogues in the Labour Front but,\r\n\r\nsurely  there  must be some social democrats  in  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front who should be able to see  that  it  is\r\n\r\nagainst  the  interest  of  democratic  socialism  to\r\n\r\nattempt to destroy the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a closing down of the P.A.P is what the White\r\n\r\nPaper  has  attempted to prepare the way for-a  White\r\n\r\nPaper  presented  and published by the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nGovernment in conjunction with the colonial power.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attempt, Sir, was made in two ways : - First: by\r\n\r\nthe deliberate suppression of certain facts so as  to\r\n\r\nmake  it  appear that the purge was intended to  save\r\n\r\nthe    P.A.P. from   capture   by   a    Communist\r\n\r\ngroup - suppressio veri, suggestio falsi. It suppressed\r\n\r\nthe   truth  that  the  leaders  of  this  group  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  arrested  were  on  the  point   of\r\n\r\ncapturing  the Trades Union Congress by the  22nd  of\r\n\r\nAugust  and  so by inference suggested the  falsehood\r\n\r\nthat the purge was because the P.A.P. had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  captured by the Communists. Second: by  falsely\r\n\r\nmaking  it appear in the White Paper that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis  a  Communist  front organisation when  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister knew as he admitted in his Press conference,\r\n\r\nreported in the Press of the 25th of August, that  it\r\n\r\nis a genuine political organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister exploited the temporary\r\n\r\ndifficulties  of  the P.A.P. We the  P.A.P. have  no\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch. Whether a person is a Communist or  a\r\n\r\nCommunist agent, only he knows and God knows. Between\r\n\r\nhis  conscience  and God of course lies  the  Special\r\n\r\nBranch  and it is up to them to show that  these  men\r\n\r\nwhom  they  have arrested are Communists or Communist\r\n\r\nagents.  We  know some of these men  as  a  dissident\r\n\r\nfaction in the P.A.P. who tried to oppose and reverse\r\n\r\nthe policy of the last Central Executive Committee of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while we were engaged in a fight with this\r\n\r\ndissident  faction,  the  Government  waded  in   and\r\n\r\narrested them and at the same time published a  White\r\n\r\nPaper which made it appear that the Party was thereby\r\n\r\nsaved from penetration and capture by the Communists.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Government tried to discredit us. But what\r\n\r\nare  the  facts  which  this  White  Paper  does  not\r\n\r\ndisclose?  With  regard to the trade union  position,\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper ended on page 6 with a statement  in\r\n\r\nthe middle of the page saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"On July 18th a meeting of representatives of the\r\n\r\nS.T.U.W.C. [Singapore Trade Unions Working  Committee\r\n\r\nwas   held  at  Middle  Road  at  which  tactics  for\r\n\r\nstrengthening  its  organisation  and   for   gaining\r\n\r\ncontrol of the T.U.C. were discussed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there the story ends. We are led to believe that\r\n\r\nthat  was the position when the purge began. Can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  deny that the leaders of this group  they\r\n\r\nhave  arrested  were on the point  of  capturing  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. by  the evening of the 22nd August  when  the\r\n\r\npurge  began?  Why did the White Paper  not  disclose\r\n\r\nthat  for  some time since the return  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's  driver Mr Lee Yew Seng (who looks  after\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. for him) returned from his May Day  visit\r\n\r\nto  Peking, where a photograph was taken of  him  and\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese  Prime Minister Mr Chou En-lai,  this  group\r\n\r\nhad  been  making progress with him, that things  had\r\n\r\nreached the point where on the night of the 22nd  the\r\n\r\nso-called 32 unions led by this group were  about  to\r\n\r\nbe  accepted  into  the T.U.C. and  so  capture  it,\r\n\r\nleaving  the Labour Front without their 'mass'  base?\r\n\r\nWhy  was  it not disclosed that on the night  of  the\r\n\r\n22nd  itself when the Police surrounded the  premises\r\n\r\nat  Middle  Road  the  so-called  32  unions  special\r\n\r\ncommittee   was   holding  a  meeting   to   finalise\r\n\r\narrangements  for their joining in and  capturing  of\r\n\r\nthe T.U.C.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not because it would have been acutely\r\n\r\nembarrassing for the Labour Front to confess that  it\r\n\r\nacted to save the T.U.C.? And can the Government deny\r\n\r\nthat  it  was this same group that fought the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  candidate in the Cairnhill by-elections  where\r\n\r\nthey organised support for one Mr Goh Kong Beng  and\r\n\r\nso  split  the  working class vote and  defeated  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  candidate? Why was  this  episode  not\r\n\r\ndisclosed? Had this no bearing on what followed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no civil disturbances on the 22nd of\r\n\r\nAugust, no obvious cause for a purge. So the conflict\r\n\r\nin  the  P.A.P. was  exploited. The  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nthought  he  could hurt both groups  in  the  P.A.P.:\r\n\r\narresting  one  because  he  suspected   it   to   be\r\n\r\nCommunist,  and by the timing making it  appear  that\r\n\r\nthe  other  had precipitated the arrest.  To  achieve\r\n\r\nthis,  the  White Paper preoccupied itself  with  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and the real reason that the T.U.C. was  then\r\n\r\nin  imminent danger was concealed. Sir, it  is  clear\r\n\r\nthat  the  White Paper must have been prepared  quite\r\n\r\nsome  time ago for it to have been published  on  the\r\n\r\n23rd of August, the day after the purge. But why,  it\r\n\r\nmay  be asked, was the purge not made earlier, at the\r\n\r\nheight  of  the  conflict in the  P.A.P.,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nembarrass us even more? Was it not because there  was\r\n\r\nan  Assembly sitting fixed for the 21st of August and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  disliked the prospect  of  an  early\r\n\r\ndebate  and  so  waited till the 22nd, the  following\r\n\r\nday?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Government's action was calculated\r\n\r\nto  embarrass us. This purge and the White Paper were\r\n\r\nin  the  making  quite some time  before  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nannual conference fixed for the 4th of August. If the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was as well informed as the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nsuggests, then they must have been forewarned that  a\r\n\r\nconflict  was  likely  on  the  4th  of  August.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  waited for this to happen,  waited  until\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. was threatened, waited until the Assembly\r\n\r\nsitting  of the 21st was over and then moved  in.  On\r\n\r\nthe  22nd of August 1957, V.I.P.'s from all over  the\r\n\r\nworld  were arriving for the Merdeka celebrations  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur - a most inopportune moment for a  purge,\r\n\r\nfor  if  the  mass arrests contemplated had  provoked\r\n\r\nresistance  and  riots,  it  would  have  been   most\r\n\r\nembarrassing  for the Government. Yet the  Government\r\n\r\nhad  to  move. I suggest the conclusion is  therefore\r\n\r\nirresistible that the Government had to  accept  this\r\n\r\nrisk  because of a compelling reason - the  rescue  of\r\n\r\nthe   T.U.C.,  the  Government's  'mass'  base,  from\r\n\r\nimminent  danger.  It is therefore dishonest  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to have suppressed this vital fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the second way of trying to destroy the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwas  even more dishonest. If the Chief Minister  knew\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. was a genuine political Party,  then\r\n\r\nwhy  did he not say so in the White Paper instead  of\r\n\r\nmaking  it  appear that the P.A.P. is not  a  genuine\r\n\r\npolitical  Party but a Communist front  organisation?\r\n\r\nWhy  say  in paragraphs 36 and 37 that the Communists\r\n\r\nhad  dominated the Party and would do  so  for  good?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Chief Minister has not read paragraphs 36\r\n\r\nand 37. Paragraph 36 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"New leaders and organisers have taken the place of\r\n\r\nthose  removed.  As  each month  goes  by,  Communist\r\n\r\nactivities become more frequent and more blatant; and\r\n\r\nthe  power  of  persons known to be Communist  grows.\r\n\r\nOnce  again the aim is to bring about a united  front\r\n\r\nof  workers,  farmers  and students  supported  by  a\r\n\r\nfavourable  press and by political sympathisers.  The\r\n\r\ngravest developments have been amongst the workers. A\r\n\r\ndetermined  and  successful bid for  controlling  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has been the second feature of recent months.\r\n\r\nHere the Communists have worked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough  the  cultural,  educational  and  propaganda\r\n\r\ngroups  in the P.A.P. and through them have gone  far\r\n\r\nto obtain domination of the whole Party organisation.\r\n\r\nThere   has   also  been  revived  activity   amongst\r\n\r\nstudents, farmers, women and \"cultural\" groups.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 37 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is evident that once again a serious threat is\r\n\r\ndeveloping. Communists and their agents are  back  in\r\n\r\nkey  positions daily increasing their propaganda  and\r\n\r\ntheir power, and steadily strengthening the extent of\r\n\r\ntheir  control and thus again building  up  a  united\r\n\r\nCommunist  front.  If  the situation  is  allowed  to\r\n\r\ndeteriorate, it will become increasingly difficult to\r\n\r\ncheck  the  threat,  and  decisive  action  will   be\r\n\r\nresisted with consequent rioting and blood-shed. From\r\n\r\npast  experience it is quite clear that there  is  no\r\n\r\nprospect  at all that these legal organisations  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to purge themselves of Communist  influence\r\n\r\nand   conform   to   democratic  and   constitutional\r\n\r\npractice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why say in paragraphs 36 and 37 that we the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  been dominated by the Communists and they would\r\n\r\ndo  so for good? Can it be that this White Paper  was\r\n\r\nnot  the  work of the Chief Minister but  of  someone\r\n\r\nelse  who had got it past the Chief Minister and  his\r\n\r\nelected colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government was as well informed as it claims\r\n\r\nto   be,   it  must  have  known  that  the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nactivities were perfectly legitimate and commendable.\r\n\r\nWe  do  not  pretend that our Party is impervious  to\r\n\r\nCommunist  penetration. No party is.  The  M.C.P. is\r\n\r\ndenied   political  existence  and  must  resort   to\r\n\r\nclandestine   methods  to  enter  the  constitutional\r\n\r\npolitical arena. Does the Labour Front deny that  its\r\n\r\norganising  secretary, a confessed ex-member  of  the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Communist Party, closed down several  Labour\r\n\r\nFront branches because he thought some Communists had\r\n\r\ngone in? Surely, the Government knew that some of the\r\n\r\nblatant and crude tactics in disseminating propaganda\r\n\r\nin  the P.A.P. of a kind foreign to our Party's  aims\r\n\r\nand  objectives  was the work of a  few  individuals,\r\n\r\nthat the general membership were not parties to this,\r\n\r\nthat  the Party leadership was opposed to this,  that\r\n\r\nthey had consistently stamped out such activities and\r\n\r\nthat they had been consistently firm and resolute  in\r\n\r\ntheir non-Communist stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the White Paper tried to make it appear that the\r\n\r\nParty leadership was weak, effete and ineffective and\r\n\r\nunable  to  resist penetration and so the  Government\r\n\r\nhad  to step in. It says in paragraph 37 and I  quote\r\n\r\nit again:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"From past experience it is quite clear that there\r\n\r\nis  no prospect at all that these legal organisations\r\n\r\nwill   be  able  to  purge  themselves  of  Communist\r\n\r\ninfluence    and    conform   to    democratic    and\r\n\r\nconstitutional practice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell the Government this, that we in the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are quite capable of looking after  ourselves\r\n\r\nand  the P.A.P. Perhaps it may be different with  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. It is the P.A.P. and the P.A.P. only which can\r\n\r\nsettle its own internal problems and the Government's\r\n\r\naction  particularly in publishing this  White  Paper\r\n\r\nwas calculated to harass and hinder the P.A.P. in its\r\n\r\nwork.  Does the Government believe that by this purge\r\n\r\nthey have saved the T.U.C. for ever more? Or does the\r\n\r\nGovernment  propose to purge again if the  T.U.C. is\r\n\r\nagain threatened? But next time, there may not  be  a\r\n\r\nconflict  in the P.A.P. to be used as a pretext.  The\r\n\r\neffective way of checking peaceful penetration is by\r\n\r\npeaceful resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has chosen to act in the way it did.\r\n\r\nNow  it  is  up to them to explain their actions  and\r\n\r\nwhat  is  more important to show that they have  not\r\n\r\narrested  innocent  people. If the Government  thinks\r\n\r\nthat because some of these men arrested have opposed\r\n\r\nus  in  the past we are not going to fight for  their\r\n\r\nrights under the law, they are mistaken.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But surely the biggest inaccuracy which is just a\r\n\r\nparliamentary way of saying falsehood  in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper is in paragraph 36:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A determined and successful bid for controlling the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has been the second feature of recent months....\r\n\r\nhave  gone far to obtain domination of  the  whole\r\n\r\nParty organisation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists have not made a successful bid for\r\n\r\ncontrolling   the  Party.  They  have  not   obtained\r\n\r\ndomination   of'   the   Party.   The   non-Communist\r\n\r\nleadership  of  the Party had not  been  ousted.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment's own action in not arresting seven out of\r\n\r\nthe twelve Central Executive Committee members of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Party is an admission that at its highest even if\r\n\r\nthe  Government can prove that every one of the  five\r\n\r\narrested   are  Communists  or  their   agents,   the\r\n\r\nCommunists are still not in the majority and  not  in\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the  Party. To say as  the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nstates  in  paragraph  36  that  the  Communists  had\r\n\r\nobtained  domination of the whole Party is manifestly\r\n\r\nuntrue.  It  was a fabrication by the  Government  to\r\n\r\njustify  their action. I challenge the Government  to\r\n\r\ndeny  that they would have carried out this purge  in\r\n\r\nany case because of the threat to the T.U.C. and that\r\n\r\nthey  used the so-called Communist domination of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. as a mere pretext.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front Coalition may try to discredit the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. but they will never succeed in destroying  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  We  are  a  virile and  a  genuine  political\r\n\r\norganisation.  We  shall always remain  so.  No  one,\r\n\r\nneither  the  Labour Front Coalition nor the  M.C.P.,\r\n\r\ncan discredit or destroy us. The Government may close\r\n\r\nus   down   but  our  movement  goes  on.  We   stand\r\n\r\nuncompromisingly for an independent, democratic, non-Communist,   socialist  Malaya  by   democratic   and\r\n\r\nconstitutional means and we shall not waver from this\r\n\r\nstand.  We  believe  that by  only  free  competition\r\n\r\nwithin the non-Communist democratic system can such a\r\n\r\nsocialist society be achieved in Malaya; that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible in Malaya to achieve Socialism  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  one-party dictatorship.  In  multi-racial\r\n\r\nMalaya  with  three major races - Malays,  Chinese  and\r\n\r\nIndians -  all with differing cultural and  linguistic\r\n\r\nbackgrounds, and even more important, with  different\r\n\r\npolitical  traditions and concepts, the  dictatorship\r\n\r\nof  any  one  party may lead to racial  conflict  and\r\n\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not afraid to fight for what we believe in.\r\n\r\nOur  Party policy is fundamentally correct.  We  have\r\n\r\nproved it in the past and shall prove it again in the\r\n\r\nfuture.  The  P.A.P. can only be  destroyed  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. by deviating from our correct stand. Our stand\r\n\r\nis clear, consistent and unwavering. Our  tactics may\r\n\r\nchange  according  to  changes  in  the  political\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  may  be  adjusted to fit each phase of the  anti-colonial  struggle.  But we  are  clear,  honest  and\r\n\r\nundeviating  in our objectives. And we  will  not  be\r\n\r\ndeterred from these objectives either by threats from\r\n\r\nthe  colonial  power or from the Communists  or  from\r\n\r\nanybody  else. The Straits Times, voice  of  colonial\r\n\r\nvested  interest, will not shift us into a hysterical\r\n\r\nanti-Communist  stand. For Malaya  to  join  the  mad\r\n\r\ncrusade  of  Formosa and South Korea in  \"liberating\"\r\n\r\nAsia from the Communists will only add grave problems\r\n\r\nfor  ourselves. Nor, may I add, will  we  fulfil  the\r\n\r\nhope  of Freedom News, voice of the Malayan Communist\r\n\r\nParty,  that - I  quote the White  Paper  which  quotes\r\n\r\nFreedom News - \"P.A.P. inclinations can be changed.\" We\r\n\r\nare  firm in our belief that the democratic  road  is\r\n\r\nthe  only road possible to a Socialist Malaya and  we\r\n\r\nshall  fight  to prevent the democratic  system  from\r\n\r\nbeing destroyed in Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We admit, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is a difficult\r\n\r\nrole  to  play. If you do not accept the  embrace  of\r\n\r\ncolonialists, then the colonialists charge  you  with\r\n\r\nbeing  pro-Communists. If you reject the advances  of\r\n\r\nthe  Communists,  they charge  you  with  being  pro-colonialists. We have not the slightest intention  of\r\n\r\nbeing  embraced by or being dependent  on  either  of\r\n\r\nthem.  We  will  pursue our democratic, non-Communist\r\n\r\nSocialist  objectives without regard  to  whether  we\r\n\r\nplease   the  pro-Communists  or  the  anti-Communist\r\n\r\ngroup.  We  shall fight both to the extent  to  which\r\n\r\nthey  stand  in  the  way  of  our  objectives.   Our\r\n\r\nintention  is  to  build  up  our  strength  and  our\r\n\r\nfollowing of people who believe in our ideals and who\r\n\r\nwill  be prepared to fight for these ideals.  But  in\r\n\r\nthis  fight we shall not make the mistake of  allying\r\n\r\nourselves with so-called anti-Communist forces  which\r\n\r\nare often cloaks to hide reactionary elements ranging\r\n\r\nfrom   colonial  vested  interests  to   enemies   of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now with an independent Federation of Malaya and\r\n\r\na  new constitution for internal self-government next\r\n\r\nyear  for Singapore, a new phase opens in the  battle\r\n\r\nfor the future of Malaya.

The White Paper has not\r\n\r\ntold us the real motive behind the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurge. Is the Government trying to impress the public\r\n\r\nof  Singapore that the purge was carried out to  save\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. which the Chief Minister admitted  is  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  political  organisation from  going  to  the\r\n\r\ndogs?  Any  political  party  has  its  own  internal\r\n\r\nproblems and we frankly admit that the P.A.P. has its\r\n\r\nown  internal  problems.  The  P.A.P.,  Sir,  is   an\r\n\r\norganisation  based on democratic principles  and  we\r\n\r\nshall solve our problems in a democratic way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the real reason for the purge is this. On the\r\n\r\nnight  of  the purge, the T.U.C. was on the point  of\r\n\r\nchanging  ownership  and everybody  in  this  country\r\n\r\nunderstands what the T.U.C. means to the Labour Front\r\n\r\nGovernment. The internal problems of the P.A.P., Sir,\r\n\r\ncan  be solved only by ourselves. We are a democratic\r\n\r\nParty and our general membership is confident of  its\r\n\r\nown capacity to solve our internal problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said in this House that there are three\r\n\r\nforces in the fight for Malaya: the colonialists, the\r\n\r\nCommunists and the nationalists. Due to the fact that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is the most anti-colonial Party in Malaya\r\n\r\ntoday,  it will be strange if the struggle  of  these\r\n\r\nthree forces is not reflected in our Party. But where\r\n\r\ndoes  the Labour Front Government stand? We know from\r\n\r\nits  action since the days of Mr Marshall  that  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front is not pro-Communist. Then is it a  pro-colonialist  party or is it a nationalist  party?  If\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Front is a nationalist party, I am  at  a\r\n\r\nloss to see why no mention is being made in the White\r\n\r\nPaper  of  the agents of colonialism that we  believe\r\n\r\nhave  also in great numbers subverted our Party.  The\r\n\r\nLabour  Front Coalition Government has been in  power\r\n\r\nfor nearly three years and in those three years may I\r\n\r\nask,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, what has it done to  capture\r\n\r\nthe hearts and the minds of the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

It is the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a few words in this White Paper\r\n\r\nwhich  to  me  are  of the greatest importance:  \"the\r\n\r\nelected  Government in the interest of  the  people\".\r\n\r\nNow  what  is an elected Government, may  I  ask?  An\r\n\r\nelected government in a democratic country means  the\r\n\r\npeople's   elected  representatives  who   form   the\r\n\r\ngovernment with an elected majority. Out of 25  here,\r\n\r\nthere  are  ten  on the Government  side.  Is  it  an\r\n\r\nelected majority Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

To\r\n\r\nmy  mind,  Sir, an elected Government should  be  the\r\n\r\nmajority   of   the  elected  Members   forming   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Now, Sir, that is not so.  Then  how  do\r\n\r\nthey  exist?  Well, with the votes of  the  Nominated\r\n\r\nMembers plus the ex-officios; but they dare not  vote\r\n\r\nall  the time with the Government on a non-confidence\r\n\r\nmotion  against them. They are kept by the P.A.P. in\r\n\r\npower  all the time.

Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. has feared that the Liberal-Socialists might\r\n\r\nform  a  Government  if the present  Government  were\r\n\r\noverthrown,  but that is not so. The  people  on  our\r\n\r\nside, who are always fighting for an elected majority\r\n\r\nGovernment, will never form any government  and  have\r\n\r\nnot  even the idea of forming the government, without\r\n\r\nan  elected  majority. Sir, the best  remedy,  may  I\r\n\r\nsuggest to the hon. Mover of the motion, is to  throw\r\n\r\nout  this Government and have an all-Party Government\r\n\r\ntill the elections come. That will save a lot of cost\r\n\r\nto  the public, if you can manage the Government till\r\n\r\nelection  time comes. I hope the mover of the  motion\r\n\r\nwill reply to this question I have asked: What is the\r\n\r\nuse  of  attacking  Government when  that  Government\r\n\r\nexists on the P.A.P. vote?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Will the hon.

In fact they press themselves\r\n\r\nforward  to  get into it. But on this  occasion  they\r\n\r\nfind  the light thrown on them by the White Paper  is\r\n\r\none that shows up their spots and wrinkles, the parts\r\n\r\nof  themselves which they hoped would not be exposed.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  do well understand that the P.A.P. find  this\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  a bitter pill to swallow, because  they\r\n\r\nhave been guilty of the errors of judgment which  one\r\n\r\nexpects  from  young  men in a hurry.  I  have  great\r\n\r\nrespect  for  many  of  the members  of  the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nincluding  indeed some of those who  are  at  present\r\n\r\nenjoying the hospitality of Her Majesty in detention,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is most tragic to this country that  in  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of youth and the inexperience  of  youth,\r\n\r\nyoung  men  of ability and courage and fine qualities\r\n\r\nshould  allow themselves to be bewildered and bemused\r\n\r\nby  slogans and catchwords, when they fail to  assess\r\n\r\nreality  seriously, when they hasten  themselves  and\r\n\r\ntheir  followers on to subject the whole  country  to\r\n\r\nmost dangerous and ill-advised courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been in the past a considerable attitude\r\n\r\nof  intellectual self-satisfaction in  the  P.A.P.  I\r\n\r\nremember that in the very first speech which the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar made in this House he  laid\r\n\r\nstress  on  the  extent to which  the  P.A.P. thinks\r\n\r\nthoroughly  and carefully and weighs its  words  well\r\n\r\nbefore  it makes any pronouncement. And of course  in\r\n\r\nthe  speech he just made this morning, the same thing\r\n\r\nagain - he drew attention to the need to be precise and\r\n\r\nclear  in what he was saying. That is a very laudable\r\n\r\nand admirable attitude in a political leader and in a\r\n\r\npolitical Party, but it is not in itself a sufficient\r\n\r\nattitude unless the precise decisions are based on  a\r\n\r\nthorough analysis of the real situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me that the P.A.P. thought that they\r\n\r\ncould  ride on the shoulders of the Communists  to  a\r\n\r\nnationalistic  victory. And  I  might,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nquote  not  my  own  views but  those  of  Mr  Habib\r\n\r\nBourghuiba, the founder of the Neo-Destour  Party  in\r\n\r\nTunisia  and  now its Prime Minister and Minister  of\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs, and the President of the  Tunisian\r\n\r\nNational  Assembly, because he has some very sensible\r\n\r\nthings   to  say  on  this  problem.  He  writes   on\r\n\r\n\"Nationalism  the  antidote to  Communism\".  He  says\r\n\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"One of my earliest companions in the struggle for\r\n\r\nindependence  is  a case in point. As  a  student  in\r\n\r\nParis,  at  a time when French rule seemed absolutely\r\n\r\nunalterable   and   the  original  Destour   movement\r\n\r\nstanding  still,  he became a member  of  the  French\r\n\r\nCommunist Party, but after he had returned to Tunisia\r\n\r\nhe realised that Communism was a false substitute for\r\n\r\nhis patriotic ideals and he joined me in founding the\r\n\r\nNeo-Destour Party to fight actively for independence.\r\n\r\nToday he laughs at his youthful error and finds  that\r\n\r\nhis concern for social justice is fully satisfied  by\r\n\r\nthe struggle to develop his new country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the people who have really done a fine\r\n\r\njob  in  Tunisia and who have incidentally  kept  the\r\n\r\nTunisian Communist Party, the P.C.T., down to one per\r\n\r\ncent   of  the  votes  actually  cast  in  the   last\r\n\r\nelections.

Member for Bukit  Timah  was\r\n\r\nquoted in the Press as having said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I share the same beliefs and have the same aims as\r\n\r\nFong   Swee  Suan  and  Yong  Kok  Kim.  I  therefore\r\n\r\nchallenge the Government to arrest me too.\" - July  11, 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>August 24, 1955, Mr Yong Kok Kim was convicted in an\r\n\r\nopen  court  of  law  and sentenced  to  five  years'\r\n\r\nimprisonment for terrorist activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was one Communist ally whom the hon.

He\r\n\r\nreferred   to   a  Singapore  journalist's   article,\r\n\r\n\"Nationalists  hatching Red  eggs\",  published  in  a\r\n\r\nSingapore newspaper in 1951, and he regarded it as  a\r\n\r\nvery  appropriate and intelligent comment on  certain\r\n\r\ntypes of nationalists. And he goes on to say:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If a country were to link its political or economic\r\n\r\nfate  to  that of the Communists how long  could  its\r\n\r\ncivilisation endure? A unified philosophy, a  unified\r\n\r\nway  of  life  are essential conditions  of  national\r\n\r\nstability.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the P.A.P. has a dissident faction but feels it\r\n\r\nhas  not  got Communists. Well, that is a  matter  on\r\n\r\nwhich  discussion is possible but I do not  think  it\r\n\r\ncan be accepted that they have managed to study their\r\n\r\nParty  with  all  the care that they  ought  to  have\r\n\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon.

He  felt  that  the  White   Paper   was\r\n\r\n\"preoccupied with the P.A.P.\"- those were  his  words\r\n\r\nand I wrote them down. I do not think it is like that\r\n\r\nat  all. The P.A.P. is referred to a number of  times\r\n\r\nbut  what the White Paper is preoccupied with is  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  threat which is noted as having its  many-pronged  advance in its attack on the national  unity\r\n\r\nand national freedom of this territory; and since the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was one of the vigorous, active organisations\r\n\r\nin  the  nationalist front, of course the  Communists\r\n\r\nsought  to  destroy them as well as any other  Party.\r\n\r\nAnd with great\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespect to the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  we cannot stand by in this country, recognising\r\n\r\nthe   Communist  danger  and  yet  saying,  \"We  will\r\n\r\nsurrender a Government duty to the public - the duty of\r\n\r\nsecuring  public welfare - and leave it to the  leaders\r\n\r\nof  a  political  Party  who  have  shown  themselves\r\n\r\ncapable  of serious errors - leave it to them to  purge\r\n\r\nthemselves.\" They have had a long run. Everyone  knew\r\n\r\nbefore  the  elections in 1955 that there  were  what\r\n\r\nwould   become   dissident   factions   amongst   the\r\n\r\nsupporters  of the P.A.P. Everyone knew  during  1955\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member for Bukit Timah associated  himself\r\n\r\nwith  a  man  who was proved in open court  to  be  a\r\n\r\nCommunist. Everyone has known that ever since, except\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. leaders themselves, or so they wish us  to\r\n\r\nbelieve.  I have great sympathy with them  and  I  am\r\n\r\nsure they have been doing their best, and that it  is\r\n\r\nan  embarrassment and a difficulty to them  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has had to step in and say, \"Well,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  you are not winning your fight. It  does  not\r\n\r\nlook  as though you are doing well enough and we have\r\n\r\nto  get you out of your difficulties.\" Not because we\r\n\r\nwant  to  help  the  P.A.P. or to  hinder  them,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  the  country  is  more  important  than  any\r\n\r\nparticular Party or any particular individual. It  is\r\n\r\nthe country which has got to be thought of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read this White Paper I did not say to\r\n\r\nmyself,  \"Oh  dear,  oh dear,  there  is  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ngetting into a mess. We have got to lift them out  of\r\n\r\nthe  mess and give them a chance to start again.\" Nor\r\n\r\ndid I say, \"Here are these terrible P.A.P. people who\r\n\r\nhave  got to be disgraced, degraded, put to shame  in\r\n\r\nthe  eyes  of  the public.\" Neither  of  those  lines\r\n\r\noccurred to me. I was not thinking of them very much.\r\n\r\nIt  seemed to be inescapable that something had to be\r\n\r\ndone  and  what  was in my mind was  the  welfare  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and of the people of Singapore, which is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of real importance and the real objective  of\r\n\r\ngood government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member made the point that there were no\r\n\r\ncivil disturbances before this round-up. It seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  rather  a  dubious point to make.  We  cannot  be\r\n\r\nexpected  always to wait until there is going  to  be\r\n\r\nrioting in the streets before people are arrested  if\r\n\r\nnecessary. Nobody doubts that when it suits them  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party in Malaya or Singapore  or  anywhere\r\n\r\nelse  in  the world will play a legal part. The  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar knows as well as I do  what\r\n\r\nLenin wrote in his \"Left-wing Communism, an infantile\r\n\r\ndisorder,\"  in  which he said that the  revolutionary\r\n\r\nspirit  of  young Communists is often  admirable  but\r\n\r\nthey have got to learn political sense; the time  for\r\n\r\nthe revolution was when the situation had ripened  to\r\n\r\nthe  extent that revolution could succeed, and  until\r\n\r\nthen the good Communist, the practical Communist, had\r\n\r\ngot  to  twist and turn and make allies  wherever  he\r\n\r\ncould, and play a legal part and even, in some cases,\r\n\r\nappear  to  go against his principles. Because  that\r\n\r\nwas  a necessary step towards the ultimate objective\r\n\r\nand  that was the real test of the Communist. It  was\r\n\r\nnot  his  willingness when the revolution had started\r\n\r\nto go out in the streets and burn and fight and kill;\r\n\r\nthe  real test for the Communist, according to Lenin,\r\n\r\nwas  his  ability  to  sacrifice  that  revolutionary\r\n\r\nardour for a deeper purpose, a deeper ardour,  to  go\r\n\r\nhand-in-hand  with his enemies, to lead  them  along,\r\n\r\nsweetly smiling, until the time was ripe to stab them\r\n\r\nin  the  back.  That I am sure the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar and his fellow leaders in his Party are\r\n\r\nnow aware of. I doubt if they realised it and applied\r\n\r\nto their own situation back in 1954 and 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I have always been aware of it, and for a\r\n\r\nlong  time it has been the basic danger in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not that the Communists will come out in  the\r\n\r\nopen.  They know they will be beaten at once if  they\r\n\r\ndo.  They know the people are not on their side.  The\r\n\r\ndanger  is  of the dedicated right-wing Communists - no\r\n\r\nadventurism,  nothing wild, the man  who  smiles  and\r\n\r\nshakes your hand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  co-operates  with  you at  every  stage  but  is\r\n\r\nbuilding up his own position for the time when he can\r\n\r\ndestroy democracy and destroy freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very difficult path for the Communists to\r\n\r\ntake. Very often they fail. The Communists' political\r\n\r\njudgment,  Mr  Speaker, is  often  weak.  They  have\r\n\r\nintense limitations. Their Marxist dialectic - which is\r\n\r\na  useful  tool  but  a dangerous  one - puts  them  in\r\n\r\nblinkers  to the realities of the situation,  to  the\r\n\r\nneed  of  analysis of the thesis and the  anti-thesis\r\n\r\nand  the synthesis. They see the developing situation\r\n\r\nin  too  narrow terms and so they lead themselves  to\r\n\r\nmisjudge  the  situation and hasten into  ill-advised\r\n\r\nand  dangerous action which in the end, too often for\r\n\r\ntheir  happiness,  nullifies their best  efforts  and\r\n\r\ntheir most well-plotted treacheries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot, Mr Speaker, blind ourselves to the\r\n\r\nvery  real and permanent danger which this Government\r\n\r\nhas  to  face from the sustained Communist attack.  I\r\n\r\nhave   said   before  in  this  Assembly   that   the\r\n\r\nconcentration   of  attention  on  the  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nstruggle  was necessary in the past but  that  it  is\r\n\r\nessential1y looking backwards and not forwards, and I\r\n\r\nhave  urged Members of this Assembly to look  forward\r\n\r\nto  the  future. The Communists have been playing  up\r\n\r\nthe  anti-colonial struggle for their  own  interests\r\n\r\nhere,  and in Tunisia and in every other place  where\r\n\r\nthey  could  use that counter in the political  game,\r\n\r\nnot  because they are sincerely anti-colonialist  but\r\n\r\nbecause   they   wish  to  substitute   a   Communist\r\n\r\nimperialism  for  a capitalist imperialism.  And  the\r\n\r\nyoung nationalist too easily falls for this Communist\r\n\r\nfacade of anti-colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Bourghuiba - I will refrain from further quoting him in case that is irrelevant - but it is in point\r\n\r\nbecause  I feel the P.A.P. of Singapore has been  led\r\n\r\nup  the same garden path to the same point of danger.\r\n\r\nImperialism, on Lenin's analysis, is the  last  stage\r\n\r\nof  capitalist development. It is marked by  the  big\r\n\r\noutflow  of  capital investment from the  imperialist\r\n\r\npower  to the under-developed areas in which  it  has\r\n\r\nits colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat outflow of capital has substantially ceased.  It\r\n\r\nbegan to dry up before the last world war. Since  the\r\n\r\nlast  world  war, private capitalist  investment  has\r\n\r\nbeen  dribbling  away and the imperialist  capitalist\r\n\r\nsystem  has been withering on its stalk for  lack  of\r\n\r\nsap  to  keep it going. And consequently anybody  who\r\n\r\nhas   seriously  studied  the  situation  has   said:\r\n\r\ncolonialism is going to end; it may be five years, it\r\n\r\nmay be 10, but the writing is on the wall. That is on\r\n\r\nthe  economic analysis of the situation, which  is  a\r\n\r\nMarxist analysis if you like to take it like that; if\r\n\r\nthe  economic  substructure is  not  there  then  the\r\n\r\npolitical  superstructure will collapse. And  if  the\r\n\r\neconomic   flow  of  capital  disappears,  then   the\r\n\r\npolitical  superstructure of  colonialism  must  also\r\n\r\ndisappear. The situation has changed in its  economic\r\n\r\nbase  and  consequently the political structure  must\r\n\r\nalso change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the excitable young nationalist fails to make\r\n\r\nthis analysis and, consequently, ties himself up with\r\n\r\nthe Communists instead of settling down seriously  to\r\n\r\nsay,  \"What shall we do to make this into  a  country\r\n\r\nfit  for our people when we have control of it?\"  The\r\n\r\nhon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar told us very  recently\r\n\r\nin  this  House how one of his friends or  colleagues\r\n\r\nnow  in  Changi Prison had said to him, \"I say,  man!\r\n\r\nThe  Federation is getting Merdeka! I  say,  we  must\r\n\r\nthink  about  this. Oh, I say, we'd better  tell  the\r\n\r\nchaps  in  the  jungle to stop their armed  conflict.\r\n\r\nThis  is  getting dangerous. They're fighting against\r\n\r\nthe elected Government.\" Really, a man who is as slow\r\n\r\nin  his  thought  as  that, who could  not  see  this\r\n\r\ninevitable  development  over  the  last  few  years,\r\n\r\nreally hardly deserves to be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Bukit Timah way back in\r\n\r\nNovember 1955 said the Emergency has acted as a check\r\n\r\non   the   growth  of  the  activities  of  all   the\r\n\r\nprogressive  nationalist forces in this  country  and\r\n\r\nhas  meant the expenditure of large sums of money  to\r\n\r\nexterminate  the Malayan Communist Party.  All  these\r\n\r\nresources and money, he said, could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been  more profitably used for the  social  and\r\n\r\neconomic  development of this country. The  Emergency\r\n\r\nhas  wasted human life and material resources without\r\n\r\nachieving  a  single beneficial result. And  that  is\r\n\r\nwhat Communism has done for Malaya and Singapore,  to\r\n\r\nwaste  human  lives,  human resources,  and  material\r\n\r\nwealth;  and  that is what it will do  unless  it  is\r\n\r\nbrought  under  control and the Communists  learn  by\r\n\r\nbitter  experience that they are not going to  get  a\r\n\r\nfree chance to work treacherously for the destruction\r\n\r\nof the prosperity and wealth of this country, for the\r\n\r\ndestruction  of  freedom,  for  the  destruction   of\r\n\r\nnational unity. That is perhaps the inaccuracy  which\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member might have picked on, in  that  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper has not stressed that aspect - the  aspect\r\n\r\nof  the ill-judgment, the errors of the non-Communist\r\n\r\nmembers  of the P.A.P. who allowed themselves  to  be\r\n\r\nled up the garden path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.27 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  speak in support of the motion  before  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  The  White Paper, as a political analysis  of\r\n\r\nthe current situation, is naive and immature, but  as\r\n\r\nan  attempt at concealment and evasion it is quite  a\r\n\r\ncunning   piece  after  months  of  tedious   labour.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Sir,  it cannot conceal the inconsistencies\r\n\r\nand  the inaccuracies of fact. It is unfortunate that\r\n\r\n'he   trade  unions  in  this  island  are   divided,\r\n\r\nprimarily,   Sir,  because  of  different   political\r\n\r\naffiliations. We all know once the T.U.C. is gone the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front has no \"mass\" base. The office  of  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Minister and consequently the  labour\r\n\r\nFront becomes shaky. The White Paper did not tell  us\r\n\r\nthe  fact that were it not for this purge, the T.U.C.\r\n\r\nmay   have  changed  its  political  complexion   and\r\n\r\naffiliations on the night of the purge. But purge  or\r\n\r\nno purge, Sir, in the long run, the leadership of the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement can only be effectively achieved\r\n\r\nand   consolidated   by  better  organisation,   more\r\n\r\nunselfish work and more sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation of Malaya has just won its freedom\r\n\r\nbut  the  struggle  for Merdeka in Singapore  through\r\n\r\nmerger  with the Federation still goes on. There  are\r\n\r\nthree main forces competing for political control  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Malaya after Merdeka.  They  are  the\r\n\r\nforces  of reaction, the forces of democracy and  the\r\n\r\nforces  of  Communism.  The  British,  knowing   that\r\n\r\ncolonialism is bound to go soon, naturally would want\r\n\r\na  Party  that represents the forces of  reaction  to\r\n\r\nsucceed them in the control of political power.  Sir,\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  moves and counter-moves by  the  three\r\n\r\nmajor  forces  in  this island - and perhaps  by  other\r\n\r\nminor forces - are reflected in the internal affairs of\r\n\r\nthe People's Action Party. The reason is very simple.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. is a mass Party and is in the vanguard  of\r\n\r\nthe  anti-colonial  movement.  The  White  Paper  has\r\n\r\nopenly  accused the P.A.P. of being a Communist-front\r\n\r\norganisation. Why did the White Paper  not  call  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. a British colonial-front organisation? For  if\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper is true then there must be  as  many\r\n\r\nSpecial   Branch  agents  as  Communists   who   have\r\n\r\ninfiltrated into the Party.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the attitude disclosed in the White Paper is\r\n\r\npurely  negative.  It is sterile  to  be  just  anti-Communist.  Unless we are prepared to  work  for  the\r\n\r\npeople, to educate them and organise them, fill their\r\n\r\nlives  with  a sense of purpose and fulfilment,  give\r\n\r\nthem  the  knowledge of reading, writing, of culture,\r\n\r\nof joining in a worth-while movement to improve their\r\n\r\nlives  and the lives of their fellow-men, to build  a\r\n\r\nnew,  cleaner  and more just society,  we  have  only\r\n\r\nourselves to blame if they are led away by those  who\r\n\r\nare prepared to do these things.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party, Sir, the P.A.P., is prepared to work and\r\n\r\njoin  and  lead  the people in their movement  for  a\r\n\r\nbetter  life for themselves and a better  future  for\r\n\r\ntheir  children.  So  long as we  do  that  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  the  Labour  Front, or the  British  or  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  can  do  to check  the  progress  of  our\r\n\r\nmovement. Whatever the White Paper is trying  to  do,\r\n\r\nto  damage  us  by deliberately suppressing  and  the\r\n\r\ndressing  up  of  the whole truth, we  know  we  will\r\n\r\nsucceed  in the end, on our own strength and  on  our\r\n\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.32 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the hon.

I can assure  him\r\n\r\nand  the  House that the Labour Front did nothing  of\r\n\r\nthat  kind. The Labour Front Government, if it wanted\r\n\r\nto,  could,  by  a  stroke of the  pen,  destroy  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  but it did nothing of that kind, because  we\r\n\r\nmaintained - and still maintain - that the  P.A.P. is  a\r\n\r\nlegitimate political organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon.

Selected persons were manoeuvred\r\n\r\ninto  key  positions, and the P.A.P. was firmly  linked\r\n\r\nwith  the  trade unions in which the Communists  were\r\n\r\nestablishing   themselves.   Communist   sympathisers\r\n\r\npreviously engaged in secret Communist plotting  were\r\n\r\ninstructed   to   sever  all  connection   with   the\r\n\r\nunderground    organisation,    to    destroy     all\r\n\r\nincriminating secret documents, and to concentrate on\r\n\r\novert and perfectly legitimate political work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then paragraph 27:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government was reluctant to take action likely\r\n\r\nto  affect  the  legitimate activities  of  a  lawful\r\n\r\npolitical  party, but on October 2nd,  1956,  it  was\r\n\r\nnecessary to arrest under the Preservation of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity  Ordinance  a  central  executive  committee\r\n\r\nmember  of the P.A.P. in consequence of the Communist\r\n\r\nFront challenge to lawful authority later in October,\r\n\r\nno  less  than 14 office bearers and other prominent\r\n\r\nmembers of the P.A.P. were\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrested  and  are  still  held  in  detention.

Now I wish  to  point\r\n\r\nout paragraph 30 of the White Paper, which states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In April [1957] the Kampong Kapor branch of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. held a picnic of about 300 persons at  Loyang\r\n\r\nat  which  typical Communist behaviour was  observed.\r\n\r\nAnd  on  April  14th another picnic was organised  at\r\n\r\nLoyang  of about 1,000 persons, many of whom were  of\r\n\r\nstudent   age.  Again  there  was  typical  Communist\r\n\r\nbehaviour;  and  a well-disciplined party  from  this\r\n\r\npicnic  demonstrated  with slogans  and  songs  at  a\r\n\r\npublic  rally on the Padang that afternoon to welcome\r\n\r\nback the Merdeka delegation from London.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant that the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\ndid not deny this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to make out also that the Executive\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Labour Front closed down several  of\r\n\r\nthe   Labour  Front  branches  because  of  Communist\r\n\r\ninfluence.  I  can tell him that no such  thing  ever\r\n\r\nhappened, and I should know better than he  does.  He\r\n\r\nhas always stressed that the P.A.P. is striving for a\r\n\r\nnon-Communist, independent, Socialist Malaya; I would\r\n\r\nlike to hear him say that he is striving for an anti-Communist, independent, Socialist Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.38 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed\r\n\r\na  strange  change of scene this morning.

Member for Tanjong Pagar tabling a\r\n\r\nmotion  deploring the arrests and the action  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  closing down a  number  of  Communist\r\n\r\nFront  organisations. But what do we  see  today?  He\r\n\r\ndoes   not   deplore  the  action  but   rather   the\r\n\r\ninaccuracies which he alleges are in the White Paper.\r\n\r\nMaybe  he  has come now to the realisation  that  his\r\n\r\nParty is not as clean as he thought it was last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he referred to the annual conference of his\r\n\r\nParty  on  4th  August this year. Since  that  annual\r\n\r\nconference  we  have  been treated  to  a  series  of\r\n\r\nnewspaper  reports about the conflict - which  he  does\r\n\r\nnot  deny - that has been going on in the newly elected\r\n\r\nCentral  Executive Committee, it was indeed  an  eye-opener to all of us and we became more acutely  aware\r\n\r\nof  the  trial of strength in the P.A.P. between  the\r\n\r\ngenuine  democratic leaders and the  Communist  Front\r\n\r\nleaders.

Previously, Sir, he avoided any  public\r\n\r\ncomment on the Government's action by saying that  he\r\n\r\nheld  no  office and had no mandate from  his  Party.\r\n\r\nThen  the new Secretary-General of the Party resigned\r\n\r\nbecause of \"ill-health\". Perhaps, Sir, he has a  cold\r\n\r\nin  his feet. Now, Sir, the hon. Member comes to life\r\n\r\nand puts down this motion, and as I said, Sir, what a\r\n\r\nmotion! He does not seek to deplore the action of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  but rather the inaccuracies contained  in\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper in support of our  action.  What  a\r\n\r\nchange  of  front!

The threat is real  and\r\n\r\nmust  not  be belittled. We have had enough of  riots\r\n\r\nand  disturbances. We cannot sit  by  and  watch  the\r\n\r\nCommunist Front reorganise and corrupt the  minds  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and the simple people.

And on many points of detail\r\n\r\nhe  may  well  be more accurately informed  than  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  but  minor  inaccuracies  on  points  of\r\n\r\ndetail do not affect the main conclusion of the White\r\n\r\nPaper. The truth is - and the hon. Member knows  it  to\r\n\r\nbe  the truth - that the P.A.P. has been penetrated  by\r\n\r\nCommunists.  Control  of the  Party's  education  and\r\n\r\npropaganda organisation has clearly passed  into  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  those  who, knowingly or  recklessly,  are\r\n\r\nworking for the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no good the hon.

Sir,  why  has he allowed the  P.A.P. to  be\r\n\r\npenetrated  in this way? He was in the best  position\r\n\r\nto  purge the Party of those who would use it only to\r\n\r\ndestroy  freedom and genuine democracy in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs a genuine Socialist and a genuine democrat, he had\r\n\r\na  duty to fight Communism, but for two years now  he\r\n\r\nhas  preferred to try to ride a tiger. Why? Why? Why?\r\n\r\nWe all know the answer. We also know that he is being\r\n\r\nused  by these people for their own ends and will  be\r\n\r\nthrown  overboard as soon as they no  longer  require\r\n\r\nhim.  It  will  not surprise us to learn  that  these\r\n\r\npeople no longer now require him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government, Sir, is not prepared to\r\n\r\nsacrifice  the interests of Singapore for a temporary\r\n\r\npolitical advantage. We will do our duty cost us what\r\n\r\nit may. We will do our duty cost us what it may!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not maintain in the White Paper that all\r\n\r\nactions of the P.A.P and its branches, or all members\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P., are Communist. No. But  what  we  do\r\n\r\nmaintain  is  that  the  Party has  been  dangerously\r\n\r\npenetrated  by  Communists and their  fellow-workers,\r\n\r\nand  they are misleading and gaining control  of  the\r\n\r\nParty. Seven out of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19  P.A.P. arrests  are identified  members  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunist secret organisation. Seven out of 19!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know when I faced the duty of checking the\r\n\r\nCommunist  threat  that  any  action  taken   against\r\n\r\nmembers  of the P.A.P. will be criticised - as  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  criticised  by  the  hon.  Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar - as using the pretext of the public interest  to\r\n\r\ndamage   an  opposition  political  Party.  But   the\r\n\r\nsituation was so grave and the duty to act so  strong\r\n\r\nthat  my colleagues and I were prepared to face  that\r\n\r\ncriticism rather than shirk our duty. We are prepared\r\n\r\nto  face  that criticism rather than shirk our  duty!\r\n\r\nOur  conscience is clear. Is his conscience clear?  I\r\n\r\nwonder!  We have set out the grounds for our  action,\r\n\r\nWe are content to be judged by Singapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am astonished and saddened that any\r\n\r\nresponsible person should suggest that the Government\r\n\r\nshould   allow  the  Communist  threat   to   develop\r\n\r\nunchecked  until  it  is  able  to  challenge  lawful\r\n\r\nauthority by violence. We have had violence enough in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We have seen the technique of  those  who\r\n\r\nseek  to  create conditions of chaos and the  violent\r\n\r\noverthrow  of  a  democratic form  of  Government  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We saw how they exploited  the  Hock  Lee\r\n\r\nstrike in 1955, how they attempted to awe the elected\r\n\r\nGovernment  by  a general strike the  same  year.  We\r\n\r\nwitnessed with horror the days and nights of  rioting\r\n\r\nin  October  last year. We should be failing  in  our\r\n\r\nduty if we did not use the powers to prevent disorder\r\n\r\nand  violence.  The Preservation of  Public  Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance gives us the power of detention to  prevent\r\n\r\na person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the\r\n\r\nauthority  of  Malaya  or the maintenance  of  public\r\n\r\norder  therein. It is in the discharge of  that  duty\r\n\r\nlaid upon us by this Assembly that we have acted, and\r\n\r\nthe  general grounds of our action are given  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper. The case, Sir, against each  individual\r\n\r\nnow   detained  will  be  considered  by  the  Appeal\r\n\r\nTribunal  under  the  law. Our duty  is  to  preserve\r\n\r\nsecurity  rather than to restore order  after  riots.\r\n\r\nOur  duty, Sir, is to preserve public security rather\r\n\r\nthan to restore order after riots!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon.

It  is\r\n\r\nnot  the duty of the Government to reply, but I  will\r\n\r\nsay  this:  that  it  is not true  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is taking this action in order to save the\r\n\r\nT.U.C.  The T.U.C. will, in due course, let the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar know what had been going  on\r\n\r\nbetween  the  evil  forces  in  Singapore  and  their\r\n\r\ndemocratic forces, and who were winning them.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot true to suggest that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar. Sir, tries to say\r\n\r\nthat  out  of  12  members in the  Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee only five were Communists. 'Therefore there\r\n\r\nare  still  seven  of  us who are  in  the  majority;\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  will win in the end; we will  win  the\r\n\r\nfight.' This description of the P.A.P. as having been\r\n\r\npenetrated  by Communists, and that the  leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. were weak and were not able to  meet  the\r\n\r\nthreat  is  all  wrong because we were seven  against\r\n\r\nfive.  But I may point out to him, Sir, that  if  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the P.A.P., of that  group,  had\r\n\r\nnot  suddenly  got  cold feet  because  five  of  his\r\n\r\ncomrades had been taken in under the Preservation  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Security Ordinance, he might not have  seven;\r\n\r\nhe was having six against six.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government opposes the motion before the\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.52 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  hon.

It  does  not\r\n\r\nseem to have voiced his real thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand the Chief Minister has moved me a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal.  It  seemed to me he was  speaking  with\r\n\r\nabsolute sincerity for the concern of the public  and\r\n\r\nthe  peace  and  safety of all the  peoples  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry. What he is doing is to prevent riots, not to\r\n\r\nstop  them. His chief point is that he is  trying  to\r\n\r\nprevent riots and disorders before they start, rather\r\n\r\nthan to stop them or have to meet them half-way;  and\r\n\r\nwe  all  agree  with  him that  we  have  had  enough\r\n\r\ndisorders  and  riots,  and all law-abiding  citizens\r\n\r\nwill  agree with me that any measure to prevent  such\r\n\r\ndisorders  at their inception should be  welcomed  by\r\n\r\nall of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it must be a very painful job for the\r\n\r\nGovernment or for anyone to have done what Government\r\n\r\nhas  done in trying to enforce law and order.

I  would\r\n\r\nlike to tell him and every other Member in this House\r\n\r\nthat  this motion and my speech in support of it were\r\n\r\nthe  decision of the Emergency Council of the Central\r\n\r\nExecutive Committee of the People's Action Party.  We\r\n\r\nare the leadership of the Party. If for one moment  I\r\n\r\nbelieved  I  no longer represented the  views  of  my\r\n\r\nParty,  I - and  I have my colleagues' mandate  to  say\r\n\r\nthis, - they and I would not stay for one moment longer\r\n\r\nthan necessary in the Party or in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister has to make up his mind\r\n\r\nwhat his line is - whether we are Communists or whether\r\n\r\nwe  are  a  genuine  political Party.  He  said  this\r\n\r\nmorning that of the 19 members of the Party arrested,\r\n\r\nseven had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconnections - I  have  forgotten  the  exact  words - but\r\n\r\nseven out of the 19 had connections with the M.C.P. I\r\n\r\nassume, therefore, that the other 12 are included  in\r\n\r\nthe category referred to in the last paragraph of the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper, in the sentence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Those who recklessly and knowingly allow themselves\r\n\r\nto  be  used  by the Communists, or uncritically  and\r\n\r\nunwarily accept their easy and deceptive slogans,  or\r\n\r\ndeliberately create conditions which make easier  the\r\n\r\npath of Communists to power, must be checked.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 10,000 members of the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty. Does he say that these 10,000 members come in\r\n\r\nthat  category, or does he say only  19  out  of  the\r\n\r\n10,000  come  within this category? Let me  tell  him\r\n\r\nthat  we  were elected at a Party conference  on  4th\r\n\r\nAugust,  at  which we put the issues very fairly  and\r\n\r\nsquarely.  The Minister for Communications and  Works\r\n\r\nchallenged our wisdom, according to him, of riding on\r\n\r\nthe shoulders of the Communist Party to a nationalist\r\n\r\nvictory.  Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, one other Member  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  in  April this year  made  some  similar\r\n\r\nfoolish  accusations, We took him to  task.  We  went\r\n\r\nback  to Tanjong Pagar and vindicated our stand,  and\r\n\r\nthat   Member  has  suffered  a  premature  political\r\n\r\ndemise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is my mandate, and I say that no other\r\n\r\nMember  in this House has a more clear-cut or fresher\r\n\r\nmandate  than myself, given on 29th June  this  year,\r\n\r\nand I would like to tell this House what this mandate\r\n\r\nis. This is from my election manifesto sent to 12,000\r\n\r\nvoters  in Tanjong Pagar in which my Party stand  was\r\n\r\nclearly stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"On 2nd April, 1955 you elected me as your\r\n\r\nrepresentative in the Legislative Assembly. This  by-election  is not a fight by me to get a seat  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  as I could have stayed on in my seat.  This\r\n\r\nby-election is to find out if you who elected  me  as\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. candidate in April 1955 approve of the stand\r\n\r\nthat  I  as a member of the P.A.P. and of the  recent\r\n\r\nconstitutional mission to London took on two  issues,\r\n\r\nwhich  are the constitutional proposals and the anti-subversion clause. If you agree with my stand and the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s, methods  in fighting for  an  independent,\r\n\r\nunited  Malaya, then you can show your  approval  and\r\n\r\nyour trust in my Party by giving your vote for me,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in bold type what the P.A.P, believes in:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"1. To end colonialism and establish an independent,\r\n\r\nunited Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To create a democratic, non-Communist Government\r\n\r\nof Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To abolish the unjust inequalities of wealth and\r\n\r\nopportunity of the present social system, and provide\r\n\r\nequal opportunities for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To build a Malayan consciousness among the\r\n\r\npeople of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence we stand for an independent and\r\n\r\ndemocratic Malaya. This means that we must first  get\r\n\r\nrid  of colonialism by non-violent and constitutional\r\n\r\nmeans.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again in bold type:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"What is the most effective and practical way of\r\n\r\nfighting   against   colonialism?   We   must   crush\r\n\r\ncolonialism, British colonialism, strong and cunning.\r\n\r\nWe  need several rounds to knock them out. The  first\r\n\r\nround is to expose the Rendel Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  let the Hon. the Minister for Communications and\r\n\r\nWorks  remember that in 1954 Mr C. C. Tan, and  even\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Chief Minister, proposed a constitution\r\n\r\nwhich,  according to Mr C. C. Tan, should  last  for\r\n\r\neight  years. We are not ashamed of the fact that  we\r\n\r\nmobilised  the people in opposition against  what  we\r\n\r\nconsidered a lousy and a rotten constitution.  It  is\r\n\r\nour  work that brought about a change in the attitude\r\n\r\nof  the  British Government in 1956-57. This we  have\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The second round is to fight for a constitution\r\n\r\nwhich  will  give Singapore internal self-government,\r\n\r\nThis  we  have  in the new constitutional  proposals.\r\n\r\nThis is not Merdeka; this is not independence. I have\r\n\r\nhonestly  and sincerely told the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\neach   time   before  I  went  to  London   for   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional negotiations with the Colonial  Office\r\n\r\nthat we are demanding 75 per cent Merdeka. The island\r\n\r\nof   Singapore,   with  its  one-and-a-half   million\r\n\r\ninhabitants  cannot become an independent  nation  by\r\n\r\nitself.  We  can only attain independence  through  a\r\n\r\nmerger  with  the  Federation. 'Independence  through\r\n\r\nmerger' - that  is  our battle-cry in the  third  round\r\n\r\nwith British colonialism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That,  Sir, is the P.A.P. mandate on 29th  June  this\r\n\r\nyear  which, I am glad to note from the White  Paper,\r\n\r\nhas been adopted by the Labour Front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like now to answer two important points which\r\n\r\nhave been raised in the course of this debate. Now it\r\n\r\nhas  been  suggested by the Hon. the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nthat  we have not been consistent. Last year we  were\r\n\r\nferocious,  we  were  brave  in  opposition  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment; this year we have become mild  and  timid\r\n\r\nand  timorous.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, genuine  political\r\n\r\nleaders  do  not  get  cold feet.  In  an  emergency,\r\n\r\ncourage  is  what we show and our policy is  dictated\r\n\r\nnot because we have got cold feet, not because we are\r\n\r\nafraid to be locked up by the Hon. the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nand  his colleagues, but because of our principle and\r\n\r\nour  policy. We say quite clearly, and I said it this\r\n\r\nmorning  at  the  end of my speech,  that  those  who\r\n\r\nfought  with us on the agreed Party policy  we  stand\r\n\r\nby;  but  even  those  in  our  Party  who  tried  to\r\n\r\nundermine our policy we do not abandon. It is  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government to show that they are  Communists  or\r\n\r\nCommunist agents. Until then we shall press for their\r\n\r\nrights under the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, the position this year is well\r\n\r\nknown  to  anybody  who has been following  political\r\n\r\ntrends  in Singapore. I would like to read an excerpt\r\n\r\nfrom  the  annual report of my Party which  the  last\r\n\r\nCentral  Executive Committee presented to  an  annual\r\n\r\nconference.  And  this will explain the  consistency,\r\n\r\nthe  honesty of our stand. We said, on page 5 of this\r\n\r\nreport:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"1957 Merdeka Mission: In March this year, an all-Party delegation left for London to reopen talks for\r\n\r\na   constitution  giving  Singapore  internal   self-government. Our Party delegate was Mr Lee Kuan  Yew.\r\n\r\nThe  delegation was charged with a mandate agreed  to\r\n\r\npreviously  at an all-Party convention.  The  minimum\r\n\r\ndemands  were  agreed to unanimously by  the  Central\r\n\r\nExecutive Committee at the end of February 1957.  One\r\n\r\nof  the  decisions  made unanimously  by the  Central\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee at the meeting on Saturday,  2nd\r\n\r\nMarch, was to postpone the fresh elections under  the\r\n\r\nnew  constitution from the target date of August 1957\r\n\r\nin order to allow time for the new Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nto  be registered and given the right to vote at  the\r\n\r\nelections.  The  length  of  the  postponement  would\r\n\r\ndepend  on the period set aside for registration.  It\r\n\r\nwas  estimated that for a registration period of  six\r\n\r\nmonths, a years delay was probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tanjong Pagar By-election: When the Party delegate\r\n\r\nwas  in  London, certain trade union officials joined\r\n\r\nMr  David  Marshall in attacking the Party  for  the\r\n\r\ndecision to postpone the elections until registration\r\n\r\nof new Singapore citizens and attempted to coerce the\r\n\r\nParty into reversing its decision. The Party delegate\r\n\r\nreturned with the all-Party Delegation on 14th April,\r\n\r\nThese  attacks on the Party continued.  The  proposed\r\n\r\nagreed   constitution  giving  only  internal   self-government was also attacked by Mr Marshall and this\r\n\r\ngroup.  In the debate in the Legislative Assembly  on\r\n\r\nthe constitutional talks, these attacks culminated in\r\n\r\na challenge by Mr Marshall to the Party Secretary to\r\n\r\nresign  and  fight  him in a by-election  in  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.  Three days later Mr Marshall announced  that\r\n\r\nhe  had  retired from politics and did not intend  to\r\n\r\ncontest  the  by-election. In view of  the  malicious\r\n\r\nattack  made  on  the  Party, the  Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  decided  to  place  our  record  for   the\r\n\r\njudgment of the electorate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues we placed before the electorate were:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate: 1. Accept internal self-government in the\r\n\r\nnew constitutional proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Reject clause 30 banning subversive elements from\r\n\r\ntaking part in the first general elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term: 1. To end colonialism and establish an\r\n\r\nindependent, united Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To create a democratic non-communist government\r\n\r\nof Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To abolish the unjust inequalities of wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Malayan consciousness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, this year the position is\r\n\r\nquite  simple.  The  first attempt - and  this  is  for\r\n\r\npolitical  innocents in this House who have  not,  or\r\n\r\nwho are unable to read between the lines of political\r\n\r\nevents - the  first  attempt  to  undermine  the  Party\r\n\r\npolicy was in March this year. On 2nd March, 1957, at\r\n\r\na full meeting of the Central Executive Committee, we\r\n\r\ndecided  unanimously to have registration of the  new\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens first, and then elections for  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly under the new constitution.  The\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  giving  the mandate  to  the  all-Party\r\n\r\nDelegation  for the London Constitutional  Talks  was\r\n\r\nalso  agreed. The shortcomings of the constitution\r\n\r\ngiving   only  internal  self-government  was   fully\r\n\r\nappreciated by everyone. On Sunday, 3rd March,  these\r\n\r\ndecisions  of  the  Party, my Party,  were  announced\r\n\r\npublicly at our Paya Lebar Branch conference. On  the\r\n\r\n6th  our  Party  Assemblymen voted for the  all-Party\r\n\r\nWhite Paper on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Assembly debate. On Friday,  8th,  I\r\n\r\nleft for London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was in London attending the constitutional\r\n\r\ntalks,  a  group  in Singapore, which  included  some\r\n\r\npolitical adventurers in the Party, started agitation\r\n\r\nfor  registration for new citizens after, not before,\r\n\r\nelections.  This group made use of the  names  of  19\r\n\r\nunions,  and  statements were issued  condemning  the\r\n\r\ndecision  to  register new Singapore citizens  before\r\n\r\ngeneral elections. But the firm and resolute stand of\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Executive Committee, supported  by  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  our Party members, foiled the  plot  of\r\n\r\nthis  group. They stood by the mandate to  the  Party\r\n\r\ndelegate and the plot to have him disavowed, to  have\r\n\r\nme  disavowed while I was away at the talks,  failed.\r\n\r\nThis  was  the  first  act in a series  of  left-wing\r\n\r\nadventurism of this dissident Party faction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, having failed from within the Party, they tried\r\n\r\nto  coerce the Party from without, and they exploited\r\n\r\nthe  personal and political weaknesses of  Mr  David\r\n\r\nMarshall  and instigated him to challenge  the  Party\r\n\r\nstand. Mr Speaker, Sir, in April this year I do  not\r\n\r\nthink many Members in this House understood what  was\r\n\r\ngoing  on  because they are only concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nsuperficialities of political cross-talk. But we were\r\n\r\nnot concerned with the personal likes and dislikes of\r\n\r\nMr David Marshall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when our stand was challenged and when Mr\r\n\r\nMarshall  happened to be the tool, the agent  through\r\n\r\nwhich the challenge was made, we had no choice but to\r\n\r\naccept  the  challenge. On 28th April, Mr  Marshall,\r\n\r\ntaking  the  line of this group, attacked the  Party,\r\n\r\nattacked the new constitution, asked for registration\r\n\r\nof  new  citizens  after general elections,  proposed\r\n\r\nsome  fantastic  scheme  of registration  by  way  of\r\n\r\nIdentity  Cards.  But  after  we  had  accepted   the\r\n\r\nchallenge this group of adventurers backed  down  and\r\n\r\nMr  Marshall announced his retirement from politics.\r\n\r\nBut  we  went  on with the by-elections and  put  the\r\n\r\nissues  fairly  before the people. We  won  that  by-election by a decisive majority against both\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Liberal-Socialist and an Independent, one Mr  C.\r\n\r\nH. Koh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But several issues arose out of the by-elections in\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar and Cairnhill. This group  opposed  my\r\n\r\nParty's  stand  on Merdeka through  merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  They  wanted immediate independence  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  alone. In Cairnhill, this group  organised\r\n\r\nsupport  for  Mr  Goh  Kong  Beng,  the  Independent\r\n\r\ncandidate, who was to have formed a Party with Mr C.\r\n\r\nH.  Koh,  who  was contesting against us  in  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.  We issued a directive to all branches of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. not to interfere in the Cairnhill by-election\r\n\r\nby   supporting   any  candidate  but   this   group,\r\n\r\nprincipally non-P.A..P. members, went on. The  result\r\n\r\nwas  the  victory of the Liberal-Socialist candidate;\r\n\r\nthe  result  was our new Member for Cairnhill.  Those\r\n\r\nare the hard facts of life and we had better know how\r\n\r\nthings came to be what they came to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say we who have stood by the principles and\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  our Party cannot be  responsible  for\r\n\r\nthose  who have sought to undermine the authority  of\r\n\r\nthe  Party,  harnessing it towards  ends  unconnected\r\n\r\nwith  the aims and spirit of the Party. We know  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  a dissident faction but on this  we  stand\r\n\r\nfirm:  that  their  rights  under  the  law  must  be\r\n\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Labour Front today spend some\r\n\r\ntime to show what they were doing for the cause of an\r\n\r\nindependent, democratic Malaya. Let me tell them that\r\n\r\na purely negative approach cannot succeed. If you are\r\n\r\nunable to make democratic socialism a living reality,\r\n\r\nif  it  remains only an empty slogan, it is  unlikely\r\n\r\never  to  enthral the hearts and minds of the people.\r\n\r\nTo  be  able to make it work one must be prepared  to\r\n\r\nwork and to organise. That is what we have been doing\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P. and we are not ashamed of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to remind the Labour Front Government\r\n\r\nthat  democracy  and  political stability  cannot  be\r\n\r\nbrought  about  just  by  periodic  mass  arrests.  A\r\n\r\ngovernment which relies only on purges\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  has no positive programme with which to win over\r\n\r\nthe  people  to  the democratic cause  is  doomed  to\r\n\r\nfailure.  People  will  not  support  democracy  just\r\n\r\nbecause  a  government is content  to  mouth  slogans\r\n\r\nabout  the  superiority  and desirability  of  it.  A\r\n\r\nSocialist  government which can convince  the  people\r\n\r\nthat  under its rule things are getting better,  will\r\n\r\nget even better, will be in a position, should be  in\r\n\r\na  position, to bring the masses round to their point\r\n\r\nof view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the activities of my Party have been\r\n\r\nchallenged  in  the  White  Paper,  particularly   in\r\n\r\nparagraph  30 which has been raised by the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education, I think it is dishonest  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government not to disclose at the same time that\r\n\r\nwe  castigated those who, against our policy, decided\r\n\r\nto  make  use of that occasion to humiliate the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Whampoa. If our policy had  been  wrong,\r\n\r\nthen  I  say  we  deserve to be castigated.  But  our\r\n\r\npolicy  has been consistently correct. For the Labour\r\n\r\nFront Government to try openly to implicate the whole\r\n\r\nParty in all the zigzags of tactics for which we were\r\n\r\nnot responsible is, in my opinion, downright unworthy\r\n\r\ntactics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Labour Front Government is as well informed\r\n\r\nas a government should be, as it has claimed to be in\r\n\r\nthis  White  Paper,  then  why  has  there  been   no\r\n\r\npresentation of the whole truth; why just parts of  a\r\n\r\nwhole? Why has there been no denial this morning that\r\n\r\non  the  night of the 22nd at the time the  raid  was\r\n\r\nmade  on the Middle Road premises there was a meeting\r\n\r\ngoing on to finalise arrangements to join the T.U.C.?\r\n\r\nOr  was the Hon. the Chief Minister not aware of  it?\r\n\r\nDoes the Minister for Education deny that he did know\r\n\r\nhow Mr Keng Ban Ee was defeated in Cairnhill? Can he\r\n\r\ndeny that that did not come into the calculations  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's final decision of  what  to  do  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  this situation? Why was that  denial  not\r\n\r\nmade  this  morning?  Why was the  onus  put  on  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.?  The whole of the White Paper is designed  to\r\n\r\ndiscredit us. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhole of this attack this morning is - designed to  say\r\n\r\nthat 'we have weakened,' that 'we are afraid'. Let me\r\n\r\ntell  the Hon. the Chief Minister this: but  for  the\r\n\r\nfacts we have recited we would have no hesitation  in\r\n\r\nattacking  the  Government.  We  take  our  stand  on\r\n\r\nprinciple  because  of what happened  in  the  London\r\n\r\nconstitutional  talks, because of  what  happened  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  because of  the  Tanjong  Pagar  by-elections.
