That\r\n\r\nis   what   he   meant   by   annually   recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure. But I want to prove that no work  has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  at  all  in the compilation  of  these\r\n\r\nEstimates  before  us. What is presented  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse is that it is 55 per cent of the total votes\r\n\r\nin    1962   including   Other   Charges   Special\r\n\r\nExpenditure,  and the Minister, of course,  cannot\r\n\r\nsay  that  the Special Expenditure for  1962  will\r\n\r\nalso be the same Special Expenditure for\r\n\r\n1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did make\r\n\r\na  statement  and  I  think the  transcript  is  a\r\n\r\ncorrect representation of what I said. Perhaps  it\r\n\r\nlacked precision because I did not convey the full\r\n\r\nmeaning  of what items would, in fact,  be  sought\r\n\r\nunder the vote on account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I intended to make in that statement\r\n\r\nwas  that it is the ordinary Estimates which would\r\n\r\ncome under the procedure applicable to the vote on\r\n\r\naccount, because, apart fiom O.C.S.E. items  which\r\n\r\nform a small part of the total sum in the ordinary\r\n\r\nEstimates,   the   others  cover  fairly   regular\r\n\r\namounts. I made that statement in order to compare\r\n\r\nthe  procedure for estimating expenditure  in  the\r\n\r\nordinary   Estimates  with  the  difficulties   in\r\n\r\nforecasting   expenditure   in   the   Development\r\n\r\nEstimates - that they are two different  things.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill will refer to the  whole\r\n\r\ntext  of  my  statement,  he  will  find  that   I\r\n\r\ndeveloped the reasons why, in respect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Development Estimates, it is not possible\r\n\r\nto ask for approval for part of the year. That was\r\n\r\nthe  point  I  was making, not that I intended  to\r\n\r\npull  a fast one over the Member for Cairnhill  or\r\n\r\nany  other Member. I was just developing the theme\r\n\r\nof  the  two approaches when asking for a vote  on\r\n\r\naccount. I hope I have made myself clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> On a point of clarification, if the Chair might assist\r\n\r\nus.  In view of the Minister's indication that the\r\n\r\nstatement  was not quite precise in character  and\r\n\r\nsince  we  have now received the full details,  is\r\n\r\nthere no procedure whereby we can, in fact, debate\r\n\r\nthe principal issue whether there should be a Vote\r\n\r\non Account and Development Estimates for 1963?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is too late on\r\n\r\nthat  issue.  I did indicate earlier on  that  the\r\n\r\ntime  to do that was when the Minister offered  to\r\n\r\nadjourn the House, but that offer was not taken ad\r\n\r\nvantage of. That was the time to debate whether or\r\n\r\nnot  there should have been a Vote on Account.  At\r\n\r\nthe  moment,  we are presented with this  Vote  on\r\n\r\nAccount  and  no  details of it have  been  given,\r\n\r\nquite  correctly. The only idea of a  vote  on  ac\r\n\r\ncount  is,  as  indicated in the Constitution,  to\r\n\r\nprovide for expenditure for a part of the year and\r\n\r\ndetails  need not be given. I do not know why  the\r\n\r\nMinister  chose to say 55 per cent.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nprocedure in every Parliament, that if a  vote  on\r\n\r\naccount is asked for, a lump sum is asked for  and\r\n\r\nthey  simply  say, \"We want this lump  sum  for  X\r\n\r\nmonths.\" That is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we\r\n\r\nlistened  to  the  statement of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  on 4th December, we took it to mean  that\r\n\r\nwhat he was asking the House for was just 55  per\r\n\r\ncent of annually recurrent expenditure. Those  are\r\n\r\nthe  words he used. Because of that, we  were  led\r\n\r\ninto  a position where we thought it would not  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  to scrutinise the Estimates in  detail.\r\n\r\nThis  could  account  for the  fact  that  so  few\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition have sent in amendments.\r\n\r\nIt  would  now appear that what the Minister  said\r\n\r\nwas  not  what he meant to say, because the  words\r\n\r\nare very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclear - \"55  per  cent  of the  annually  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure\". The Minister tried to pooh-pooh  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Expenditure as a small amount. But  may  I\r\n\r\npoint  out  that for 1962, that is the  basis  for\r\n\r\nthis  present  Vote on Account, the Other  Charges\r\n\r\nSpecial Expenditure is $48 million and 55 per cent\r\n\r\nof that would come to about\r\n\r\n$27 million. We are being asked - if I may touch on\r\n\r\nthe  whole lot - to vote $27 million more than  what\r\n\r\nis  actually necessary to pay for any recurrent ex\r\n\r\npenditure. Once we give our approval to  the  Vote\r\n\r\non  Account, there is no control on how that money\r\n\r\nis  to be spent. The only control is the amount to\r\n\r\nbe spent under each Head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vote on Account, in this particular\r\n\r\ninstance, Sir, comes to about $16,000 under Head 1\r\n\r\nfor  1962.  This  is  for three  items:  crockery,\r\n\r\nelectric  typewriter, and motor car.  And  55  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  that  vote is $9,000. Now,  these  three\r\n\r\nitems are special items. I do not think they  will\r\n\r\nbe  required to be purchased in 1963. We  will  be\r\n\r\nvoting $9,000 - a blank cheque to the Government  to\r\n\r\nuse in any way it may think fit so long as it does\r\n\r\nnot  spend  beyond $9,000. For all we  know,  this\r\n\r\n$9,000  could be used towards the payment  of  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  a new post or towards  new  annually\r\n\r\nrecurrent   charges,   or   for   other    special\r\n\r\nexpenditure  which, if brought to  this  Assembly,\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition might consider to be  unreasonably\r\n\r\nextravagant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is unfortunate that I have to speak in\r\n\r\nthis  strain on the Head \"Yang di-Pertuan Negara\",\r\n\r\nbut  it happens to be the very first Head. I would\r\n\r\nnot  like it to be misunderstood that I am raising\r\n\r\nanything against the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, but  I\r\n\r\nam  raising  it in the strongest terms of  protest\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Minister for Finance  who  tried  to\r\n\r\nmislead this Assembly by saying something which is\r\n\r\nnot borne out now by the facts of the case. Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like the Minister to note this: if this vote\r\n\r\nis  given, it is clear the money could be used for\r\n\r\na purpose which the Government considers advisable\r\n\r\nor necessary. The Minister need\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  have to come to the Assembly and say, \"No,  I\r\n\r\nthink we want to buy a motor boat for the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara with the $9,000.\" They  can  still\r\n\r\nbuy it so long as it does not go beyond $9,000. We\r\n\r\nwould  have, as it were, given away our rights  to\r\n\r\ncriticise  any expenditure so long as  the  amount\r\n\r\nspent  does  not go beyond the Vote on  Account - 55\r\n\r\nper cent of the special expenditure for 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am sorry if I misled\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Opposition on this point,  but  I\r\n\r\nassure you that if they were so misled, it was not\r\n\r\nintentional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill understood my remarks\r\n\r\nto  mean  that we will be asking for  a  Vote  on\r\n\r\nAccount only on\r\n\r\nO.C.A.R. items. I think that was his\r\n\r\npoint.  If  that was my intention,  I  would  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  specifically that we were  only  asking\r\n\r\nfor  a Vote on Account on O.C.A.R. items. Perhaps,\r\n\r\nas I have admitted, my presentation was lacking in\r\n\r\nprecision.  And if it has misled Members,  then  I\r\n\r\ncan only express my regret. But, Sir, if you study\r\n\r\nthe  O.C.S.E. items, you will find that  for  the\r\n\r\nmost  part  they  are  very  necessary  items   of\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  They  are items to  replace  various\r\n\r\ntypes    of   equipment   needed   in   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments. Further, some items are really in the\r\n\r\nnature   of   annually  recurrent,  for  instance,\r\n\r\n\"Scholarships, Courses and Fellowships\". They  now\r\n\r\nappear  as O.C.S.E. items. It is just not possible\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  say, \"Well, we can run the Government\r\n\r\nonly  on  O.C.A.R. expenditure.\" That  would  mean\r\n\r\nthat   replacement  of  equipment  in  the  public\r\n\r\nservices would have to be suspended. Further, some\r\n\r\nvery vital items which are really in the nature of\r\n\r\nannually  recurrent expenditure have been included\r\n\r\nfor  accounting purposes under O.C.S.E. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  quite rightly said that  it  would\r\n\r\nmean  that  the  Assembly would  be  committed  to\r\n\r\napprove  of  items of expenditure the  details  of\r\n\r\nwhich  they do not know. I think that is  a  valid\r\n\r\nsubmission  to  make,  and  I  trust  he  will  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with two assurances which I  will  make\r\n\r\nbefore the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that we shall limit as far as possible\r\n\r\nO.C.S.E. items to replacements of equipment,  very\r\n\r\nessential  purchases  of, say,  new  equipment  to\r\n\r\nmaintain efficiency, provision of certain items of\r\n\r\nexpenditure such as scholarships to which  we  are\r\n\r\nin  any  case  committed. We  shall  be  extremely\r\n\r\ncareful about introducing items such as this, i.e.\r\n\r\ngetting new types of equipment which in the normal\r\n\r\ncourse  of  events would go to the  Assembly  for\r\n\r\napproval. That is the first assurance I make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second assurance that I give to the Assembly\r\n\r\nis  that we hope it will be possible to frame the\r\n\r\nBudget  for  1963 if not by the end of next  year,\r\n\r\nthen as soon as possible after that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the difficulty we are faced with is\r\n\r\nthis:  the  Minister did say in  page  37  of  the\r\n\r\n\"first  copy\"  of  the Hansard that  the  Vote  on\r\n\r\nAccount  asked  for  is  in  respect  of  annually\r\n\r\nrecurrent   expenditure.  He  also  went   on   to\r\n\r\nenumerate  and categorise what annually  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  meant. He said that such  expenditure\r\n\r\nis  incurred in regular amounts each month,  being\r\n\r\npayment  of  salaries to staff,  regular  services\r\n\r\nused  by  the  Government such  as  water,  light,\r\n\r\nelectricity, stationery, telephone rentals, and so\r\n\r\nforth.  The enumerated and categorised items,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, are normally items which come  under\r\n\r\nannually recurrent charges. So I regret it  rather\r\n\r\nputs  us  in a difficult position for the Minister\r\n\r\nto say now that he made a slip of the tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if one examines the 1963 Estimates, Paper\r\n\r\nCmd. 39 of 1961, the Minister in his statement  at\r\n\r\npage 1, paragraph 2, says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The estimates containing a vote on account below\r\n\r\nprovide for six months requirements for the public\r\n\r\nservices  shown  under  the  respective  Heads  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for 1963. They are calculated  at  55\r\n\r\nper  cent of the votable expenditure appearing  in\r\n\r\nthe 1962 Estimates.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The    important   phrase   there   is    \"votable\r\n\r\nexpenditure\". Votable expenditure is  set  out  in\r\n\r\npage  42  of the 1962 Estimates, and the vota'b'le\r\n\r\nestimate  appears  at  the  bottom  of  the  fifth\r\n\r\ncolumn - $352,920,900. Next to it, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nis  \"Statutory Expenditure 1962 - $41.105 million\"\r\n\r\nwhich is not votable expenditure. And if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou  will be good enough to turn to page 44  where\r\n\r\nthere is a further categorisation of total amounts\r\n\r\nto  be  spent; the first column there is \"Head  of\r\n\r\nExpenditure\";    then   \"Personal    Emoluments\"; \"Annually Recurrent\"; and the \"Total\". On this page\r\n\r\n44,  Mr Speaker, Sir, Special Expenditure amounts\r\n\r\nto $48,150,370. It is a big sum. It is not a small\r\n\r\nsum. If the Minister says it is only a small item,\r\n\r\nit  is not, because $48 million is very much  more\r\n\r\nthan  the Statutory Expenditure which we  have  to\r\n\r\nincur,  being  $41 million. So it is an  important\r\n\r\nitem.  Now, that is the difficulty that we in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  find ourselves in - that  we  are  being\r\n\r\nasked to vote, by the manner in which the Minister\r\n\r\nhas approached this problem in asking for a 55 per\r\n\r\ncent  vote,  on what is known as \"votable  expenditure\",  which  includes special  expenditure.  And\r\n\r\nspecial expenditure amounts to $48 million. If you\r\n\r\nwill  look  at  page  43, under  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development, Head  20,  the  special  ex\r\n\r\npenditure  is  $6.05  million.  And  the   special\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the Minister himself [Head 32]  is\r\n\r\n$32.017  million.  Quite  a  big  sum!  What   the\r\n\r\nMinister  wants us to give him is 55 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthis  $32  million by virtue of this  Vote  on  Ac\r\n\r\ncount,which  the Opposition might not be  prepared\r\n\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the position now is this. Because of the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which this has been presented  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  I think it will become necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition to vote against all the provisions  for\r\n\r\nthe Heads which the Minister is asking, unless  he\r\n\r\nis  prepared to withdraw this Vote on Account  and\r\n\r\ncome back to the Assembly on a different basis.  I\r\n\r\nmyself,  Mr Speaker, Sir, do not think that  this\r\n\r\nis  proper  time  at which this  Vote  on  Account\r\n\r\nshould  be  asked  for. If the Minister  had  felt\r\n\r\nhonestly  that  he  could not  have  prepared  his\r\n\r\nEstimates  for 1963 in time, i.e. in  November  or\r\n\r\nDecember of this year, he could quite easily  have\r\n\r\npresented  this  Vote  on  Account  sometime  next\r\n\r\nyear - March   or  April,  June  or  July - and   the\r\n\r\nAssembly would have been prepared to look at it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall :</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> But the manner in which this has been\r\n\r\nbrought to the Asembly leaves one in doubt,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, on a number of matters. After  all,\r\n\r\nSir, the only effective control the Opposition has\r\n\r\nover  the Government is the Annual Estimates.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  govern  without  convening  the\r\n\r\nAsembly,  but  by virtue of the Constitution,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has to come annually to the Assembly to\r\n\r\nget a vote for the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

He\r\n\r\nhas made his point indirectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> So that is the position the\r\n\r\nOpposition finds itself in - that the Opposition  is\r\n\r\nconstitutionally  bound to exercise  control  over\r\n\r\nthe  Government on expenditure. The  position  the\r\n\r\nOpposition ncw finds itself in, Sir, is that it is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  give  the Government  arte  blanche  in\r\n\r\nmatters  of  expenditure to the end of June  1963,\r\n\r\nwhich the Opposition is not prepared to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, both the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  and  the Member for  Farrer  Park  made\r\n\r\nobjections  on  just this fact:  that  while  they\r\n\r\nwould  not mind agreeing to a Vote on Account  for\r\n\r\nPersonal  Emoluments  and Other  Charges  Annually\r\n\r\nRecurrent, their contention is that the  vote  for\r\n\r\nSpecial Expenditure, amounting to $48 million,  is\r\n\r\na  big item and carte blanche for so large an item\r\n\r\nof expenditure does not appear acceptable to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just explain to the Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition   that  of  the  $48  million   Special\r\n\r\nExpenditure, $30 million (the biggest single item)\r\n\r\nwould  be a contribution to the Development  Fund.\r\n\r\nYou are left, therefore, with $18 million. Now  of\r\n\r\nthat $18 million, the biggest single item would be\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  National Development -  some  $6\r\n\r\nmillion, and nearly the whole lot of that goes  to\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on the Work Brigade.  These  are,  in\r\n\r\nfact, really annually recurrent expenditure. They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  not something special, not something that has\r\n\r\nbeen  sprung on the Opposition as a new item. When\r\n\r\nI  use  the words \"annually recurrent\", I was  not\r\n\r\nusing  them in the technical sense when referring\r\n\r\nto   O.C.A.R. items  Therefore,  the  balance  of\r\n\r\nSpecial  Expenditure, after the deduction  of  $30\r\n\r\nmillion  contribution to the Development Fund  and\r\n\r\nthe cost of maintaining the Work Brigade, amounts\r\n\r\nto  some  $12, million. And six  months  of  such\r\n\r\nexpenditure  would  be  a  sum  of  just  over  $6\r\n\r\nmillion. I do not think the Opposition.,  if  they\r\n\r\nconsider  these facts, could say  that  they  are\r\n\r\ngiving the Government an undue measure of freedom\r\n\r\nin financial expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I just want to answer the Minister\r\n\r\non  the two points he raised. The first point  was\r\n\r\nabout  the  $30 million which appears  under  Head\r\n\r\n32, page 346 of the Estimates, subhead  34 - Allocation to Development Fund, $30 million. I  do\r\n\r\nagree with the Minister that that is a big sum. We\r\n\r\nvoted  that  sum last year too; we have  voted  it\r\n\r\nthis  year,  and  the  Minister  thinks  that  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  will  vote  it next  year  too.  In  all\r\n\r\nfairness,  I  do  not  think the  Minister  should\r\n\r\nassume  that.  If, for some reason,, the  Assembly\r\n\r\ncomes to the conclusion that the Development  Fund\r\n\r\nis  not doing all it can, and there are sums  left\r\n\r\nin the Development Fund, it could well be that the\r\n\r\nAssembly might not vote the $30 million.  That  is\r\n\r\nin reply to that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point the Minister made was in respect\r\n\r\nof  the Ministry of National Development, Head 20,\r\n\r\npage\r\n\r\n150.  It  is  quite  true that subhead  41,  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  Projects, $5,890,170, is the  main  item.\r\n\r\nBut  here again, Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Assembly\r\n\r\nwere  to  come to the conclusion that the projects\r\n\r\nenvisaged for 1963 are such that the Assembly does\r\n\r\nnot  approve them, then the vote could  easily  be\r\n\r\nknocked out. But the point at the moment is this:\r\n\r\nwithout  the Assembly knowing anything about  this\r\n\r\nspecial expenditure, we are being asked to vote 55\r\n\r\nper cent of $5.89 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister is trying\r\n\r\nto  explain  away his mis-statement.  He  is  now\r\n\r\ntrying   to  say  that  when  he  said   annually\r\n\r\nrecurrent expenditure,\r\n\r\nhe did not mean O.C.A.R. But let us examine his\r\n\r\nstatement again. He did\r\n\r\nitemise. He did give examples of what he meant\r\n\r\nby annually recurrent expenditure, such as\r\n\r\nregular amounts each month being payments for\r\n\r\nsalaries of\r\n\r\nstaff, regular services used by the Government,\r\n\r\nsuch as water, light,\r\n\r\nelectricity, stationery, telephone, rents and so\r\n\r\non and so forth. All these mean\r\n\r\nP.E. and  O.C.A.R. and  nothing  else.  I  must\r\n\r\nregister  my  very  strong  protest  against  the\r\n\r\nmanner   in  which  these  estimates  have   been\r\n\r\nprepared. They have not been prepared in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith   the   ministerial  statement.  They   were\r\n\r\nbrought  in  at a time when we had  been  sitting\r\n\r\nfor 22 days, and when every\r\n\r\nMember of the Assembly was very tired. If it  had\r\n\r\nbeen   a  true  statement,  no  one  would   have\r\n\r\nchallenged it. But that\r\n\r\nstatement  has now been proved to be a misleading\r\n\r\nstatement.  It  is now left to the Opposition  to\r\n\r\nshow  its  protest and disgust at the  manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich  this has been presented by voting  against\r\n\r\nevery item under every Head.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time has expired.

What is the evidence on which he\r\n\r\nmakes  this  accusation,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir?   I\r\n\r\nalready  said,  in  reply to his  question,  that\r\n\r\nGovernment   was  considering  changes   in   the\r\n\r\nremuneration of Judges.

The\r\n\r\nFederation has moved as far back as the  1st  of\r\n\r\nJune,  and  there have been new  provisions  for\r\n\r\nFederation  Judges.

The information has  been  very\r\n\r\ncarefully  tabulated and from the  figures,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we find that there is very  little\r\n\r\ndifference between what our Judges get and  what\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Judges receive. In the  case  of\r\n\r\nHigh Court Judges in England, their salaries are\r\n\r\nmore or less equated to what the permanent heads\r\n\r\nof  the  British civil service get, and  we  can\r\n\r\nsay,  Mr Speaker, that similar equations  exist\r\n\r\nboth in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I understood the\r\n\r\nGovernment   accepted  as  a   fact   that   the\r\n\r\nremuneration  of  the Judges was  inadequate.

In fact,  Sir,  all  the\r\n\r\namendments that I have put\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  are of a similar character. I have not put in\r\n\r\namendments for every Head, because I am satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  the  little bit extra to be voted  for  the\r\n\r\nother  Heads  will not give the  Government  much\r\n\r\nleeway  to do what it likes. But on this Head  of\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, Sir, the total for O.C.S.E. comes\r\n\r\nto $546,090. At 55 per cent, we are asked to vote\r\n\r\nabout  $300,000 for the Prime Minister to use  as\r\n\r\nspecial expenditure. What do we see under special\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  Sir,  under this  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nHead?  We  have  here an item  of  two  cars  for\r\n\r\nreplacement. There were two cars for  replacement\r\n\r\nin   1961,  two  more  cars  are  asked  for  for\r\n\r\nreplacement  in  1962,  and  the  two  cars  cost\r\n\r\n$47,030.   Then   again,  the  furnishings   .for\r\n\r\nTemasek, Kuala Lumpur, that is $30,000; Furniture\r\n\r\nand  Equipment for State Guest House $5,000;  and\r\n\r\nother matters into which I will not go. But  this\r\n\r\namount  of $82,000, it does. I do not think  this\r\n\r\nexpenditure will be incurred again. But  then  by\r\n\r\napproving  a vote on account of 55 per  cent  for\r\n\r\nitems  that  will  not be used - again  that  money\r\n\r\ncould  be  used  if  the Government  thought  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to buy another three cars for the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister - then we will have no control whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI  feel we could save the time of this House if I\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the Minister for Finance to  withdraw\r\n\r\nthis  and  get his staff to work on  it;  and  if\r\n\r\nwhere items under O.C.S.E. are, in fact, and  can\r\n\r\nbe  described as O.C.A.R., then put them in,  put\r\n\r\nin a provision of 55 per cent for them. But where\r\n\r\nthe  items are of a special character,  like  the\r\n\r\npurchase of cars, furnishings of guest houses and\r\n\r\nwhat  not, which definitely will not be  incurred\r\n\r\nagain  in 1963, leave them out. Then we would  be\r\n\r\nquite  satisfied.  But as it  is,  because  of  a\r\n\r\nministerial  misstatement, we  are  beginning  to\r\n\r\nhave  doubts of the intentions of the Government.\r\n\r\nSo  I  would  suggest  the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nwithdraw this and get his staff to spend  another\r\n\r\nmonth on it. Then come back to this Assembly with\r\n\r\nan  application for a vote which is more  related\r\n\r\nto  what  is required to be used in 1963, instead\r\n\r\nof coming here and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nasking us for something which is more than  what\r\n\r\nis  required to be used for 1963.

The Prime Minister  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, a citizen of Singapore himself,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  indulging,  as  Prime  Minister  of  this\r\n\r\nterritory, in constant abuse of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, whereby he has built up an image  of\r\n\r\na people who are Communists or proCommunists, a\r\n\r\npeople  who  are  to be feared,  a  people  who\r\n\r\nindulge in riots; in fact, a people for whom it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  to  seek outside  assistance  to\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to protest in the most vigorous\r\n\r\nfashion    permissible   under    parliamentary\r\n\r\nprocedure  against  the conduct  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in  that respect. I  know  there  are\r\n\r\nrules  which  prevent  us from  discussing  the\r\n\r\nconduct  of  a Member outside this  House,  but\r\n\r\nthis is conduct as a Prime Minister.

Head, like the subhead in  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's Office, surely, this reinforces\r\n\r\nthe  point I was making earlier; that  out  of  a\r\n\r\ntotal  amount of $546,000 voted for in  the  1962\r\n\r\nestimates,  about  90 per  cent  is  to  pay  for\r\n\r\nexpenses  in  our  two trade  divisions,  one  in\r\n\r\nJakarta  and one in the United Kingdom.

I  have\r\n\r\nbeen reliably informed by a firm of accountants\r\n\r\nof  repute  it  is  not a  matter  of  personal\r\n\r\nprejudice that, until the advent of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand   before   the  departure  of  the   former\r\n\r\nComptroller  of Income Tax, the Department  was\r\n\r\nfar   more   approachable  than   corresponding\r\n\r\ndepartments   in   the   United   Kingdom   and\r\n\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to draw attention\r\n\r\nto one minor aspect in which I was involved. In\r\n\r\n1960  a  new section, section 86 of the  Income\r\n\r\nTax  Ordinance, was introduced which - makes  tax\r\n\r\npayable  within seven days, not tax  on  monies\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been earned, Sir, but tax  on  the\r\n\r\ncurrent year's income. If it is not paid within\r\n\r\n30 days, Sir, then immediately it attracts a  5\r\n\r\nper  cent penalty, not 5 per cent per annum but\r\n\r\n5  per cent on the total amount allegedly  due.\r\n\r\nEven  if there was an error in computation  and\r\n\r\nit  is pointed out to the Comptroller and there\r\n\r\nis correspondence, if you exceed the 30 days by\r\n\r\none day, there is a 5 per cent penalty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that there is a discretion in\r\n\r\nthe  Comptroller  whether that  penalty  should\r\n\r\napply  or  not. I give you this  case,  Sir,I\r\n\r\nreceived a notice, and in due course I wrote by\r\n\r\nsending  a cheque for one-third of my  tax  and\r\n\r\nasking  whether I could pay the remaining  two-thirds during the next two months. Sir,  I  had\r\n\r\njust exceeded the period,- I think, by about  a\r\n\r\nday or so. I received a reply to say, \"Yes, but\r\n\r\nthe 5 per cent penalty\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\napplies.\" Now, a 5 per cent penalty for the first\r\n\r\nmonth  makes it 60 per cent interest  per  annum.\r\n\r\nAnd  a  5  per cent penalty for the second  month\r\n\r\nmakes  it  30  per  cent per annum.  The  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister, who is a statistician, can do  his  own\r\n\r\ncalculation; but it does mean, Sir, that for  two\r\n\r\nmonths'  grace I had to pay 45 per cent  interest\r\n\r\nper annum. We rightfully condemn money lenders as\r\n\r\ncriminals who charge more than 24 per cent annum.\r\n\r\nBut  documents  are available to prove  that  the\r\n\r\nComptroller  of Income Tax asked, in effect,  for\r\n\r\n45  per cent interest per annum. I promptly  went\r\n\r\nto  the  bank, Sir, and made arrangements to  pay\r\n\r\nforthwith by cheque. And when I did pay  it,  protesting  vigorously, I received a letter to  say,\r\n\r\n\"Well, in the circumstances, you need not pay  it\r\n\r\nand the penalty will not apply.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, Sir, is obvious: that the\r\n\r\nComptroller  of Income Tax did not  exercise  his\r\n\r\ndiscretion - that,  in  fact, these  almost  lethal\r\n\r\npowers   are  being  used  indiscriminately   and\r\n\r\nprobably  used  by junior officials  without  con\r\n\r\nsidering the principle involved. I say that it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the  Income  Tax  Department   to\r\n\r\nprotect  the revenue and it is perhaps  sometimes\r\n\r\nnecessary to be unpleasant about it. But there is\r\n\r\nno  need to act like thugs or to try to earn  the\r\n\r\nreputation of thugs. There is no need to be tough\r\n\r\nguys.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received complaints of delays in\r\n\r\nrefunds.  You see, Sir, you have got to pay  your\r\n\r\ntax  within 30 days in spite of any complaint you\r\n\r\nput in. But if you complain in good time, and  it\r\n\r\nis  graciously  viewed by the  Comptroller,  even\r\n\r\nthen,  Sir,  you  have to wait a very  long  time\r\n\r\nbefore you get any refund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do say, Sir, that there is, particularly in\r\n\r\nthe   Income   Tax  Department,  an   unfortunate\r\n\r\ntendency   to  absorb  all  too  readily   P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntraditions  of tough guys. All too  readily  they\r\n\r\nare  acting in a manner wholly incompatible  with\r\n\r\nthe conduct one expects and is entitled to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpect from a civil service - consideration and,\r\n\r\nparticularly,   an   intelligent   exercise   of\r\n\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, just on the evidence\r\n\r\nof   his  one  experience  in  the  Income   Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment,  the  Member for Anson  has  decided\r\n\r\nthat the Inland Revenue Department is guilty  of\r\n\r\nindiscriminate  use of its powers.  Sir,  may  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that one swallow does not make a summer.\r\n\r\nIf  the Member for Anson wants to convince us of\r\n\r\nhis  proposition, he must surely bring more than\r\n\r\nhis  own personal experience, unfortunate though\r\n\r\nit was at the beginning.

I\r\n\r\nunderstood  him to say that after  he  had  paid\r\n\r\noff, the Comptroller did say that he would waive\r\n\r\nhis tax. Is that right? This is not the way.  If\r\n\r\nI  am  that thuggish, I suggest that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  would  be  more troubled  than  what\r\n\r\nactually happened to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the delay of refund, that point was\r\n\r\nmade  by the Member for Farrer Park. I did make\r\n\r\ninquiries   from  the  Comptroller  of   Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue, and he assured me that there  was  no\r\n\r\nintention  at all on the part of his Department\r\n\r\nto  hang on to money that was not due to it. He\r\n\r\ngave   an  assurance  that  he  himself   would\r\n\r\nintervene  personally should any  instances  be\r\n\r\nbrought  to his notice.

I paid from the bank immediately\r\n\r\nwithout   seeking   that   indulgence   at    the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  cut-throat  rate.

It\r\n\r\nis  the responsibility of all governments in the\r\n\r\nsterling  area,  i.e.,  all  governments   whose\r\n\r\ncurrencies are backed by sterling in one way  or\r\n\r\nthe  other,  to  exercise a degree  of  exchange\r\n\r\ncontrol  for a general purpose, to see that  the\r\n\r\nbasic  common  unit  on which  their  individual\r\n\r\ncurrencies are based is fully protected,  should\r\n\r\nsuch  protection  be  necessary.  Sterling,   of\r\n\r\ncourse, in the last few years has been a  strong\r\n\r\ncurrency,  although  recently  in  England,  the\r\n\r\nBritish Government has\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfelt  there  is  a  certain balance  of  payments\r\n\r\nproblem.

One hopes  that  this\r\n\r\nhappy  state  of affairs will continue.  But  one\r\n\r\ncannot  say  for certain that this  will  be  the\r\n\r\ncase,  and  so  long as there is any  possibility\r\n\r\nthat  the  sterling  area  could  experience  the\r\n\r\nbalance of payment difficulties, exchange control\r\n\r\nwould be necessary as an instrument of Government\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nunderstand the Minister.

In view of the fact that the\r\n\r\npresent   Board  of  Management  is  completely\r\n\r\npolitical, would the Deputy Prime Minister make\r\n\r\nit non-political?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot\r\n\r\nagree  with the Member for Queenstown  that  only\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

If the centres happen to be\r\n\r\nin the wards represented by Opposition Members,\r\n\r\nthey  are not invited to open them. But  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Prime Minister who opens  them  and\r\n\r\ninvites others to attend. I shall leave  it  at\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a much more important matter and\r\n\r\nit is one which the Minister for Health and Law\r\n\r\nhas  dealt with. I would like to ask him:  what\r\n\r\nis  the  amount  that has been spent  from  the\r\n\r\nSilver   Jubilee   Fund   on   assistance    to\r\n\r\ntuberculosis  non-citizens  during  the   first\r\n\r\neleven  months of 1961? How many of  them  have\r\n\r\nbeen  assisted? And what will be the  cost  of\r\n\r\nassisting tuberculosis; non-citizens under  the\r\n\r\npresent  scheme on the same basis as  citizens?\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  speaks  of  economy - a  dangerous\r\n\r\neconomy - because what he has pointed out is that\r\n\r\nthey  are  sent  to S.A.T.A. and  given  X-ray\r\n\r\ntreatment. He\r\n\r\nhas  omitted to mention this basic factor, that\r\n\r\nthey   do  not  get  the  wherewithal  to  have\r\n\r\nadequate  nourishment  which  would  strengthen\r\n\r\nthem  in  order  to resist and  overcome  their\r\n\r\ndisease,  and if they are unemployed,  as  they\r\n\r\nmust\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe,  and if they are destitute - and these are  the\r\n\r\npeople  I am speaking about - and if they  have  no\r\n\r\nadequate  nourishment, then they are the breeding\r\n\r\nground  for  tuberculosis for our citizens.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthey  are  not our citizens, but let us  face  it\r\n\r\nhonestly: those people who live and work here are\r\n\r\nentitled,  from  the humane  point  of  view,  to\r\n\r\nassistance in respect of these matters.  What  is\r\n\r\nthe Government saving money for? I consider it is - and  I  say this with regret - an inhuman approach\r\n\r\nto a very human problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we come to the question of public\r\n\r\nassistance.  The Minister said  that  I  made  an\r\n\r\nexaggerated statement. What statement did I  make\r\n\r\nwhich  was exaggerated? I said that it  was  not\r\n\r\nadequate  to  increase by five per cent  in  1963\r\n\r\npayments that we would be making in 1962. The  $5\r\n\r\nextra  per head of household is for 1962, and  it\r\n\r\nis   only  five  per  cent  extra  that  we   are\r\n\r\nincreasing for 1963. Those are facts. I would not\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister for Finance  to  withdraw  any\r\n\r\nstatement that he makes because he rather  enjoys\r\n\r\nslanging me, but I do ask the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nto  review the suggestion that I have indulged in\r\n\r\nexaggeration. I would like to go further on  this\r\n\r\nsubject.  The  head of a family will  get  $21  a\r\n\r\nmonth, which\r\n\r\nis  not  bad;  the wife will get  $10,  and  the\r\n\r\nchildren  will  get $5 each. You will  see,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat when we view, shall we say, our very healthy\r\n\r\nfinancial position, when we view the surpluses we\r\n\r\nhave  every year and the dynamic picture for  the\r\n\r\nfuture, we can approach with more liberality  the\r\n\r\nquestion of those who are officially starving.  I\r\n\r\nam  quite sure the Minister accepts the figure of\r\n\r\nthe University that it requires, I think, $22  to\r\n\r\nlive on the cheapest possible food scientifically\r\n\r\npurchased  in  order to maintain  survival,  that\r\n\r\nanything less\r\n\r\nthan  that  means deterioration in  health  which\r\n\r\nwill  have an effect on the country. I know  that\r\n\r\nhe  must accept these things as facts. Let us not\r\n\r\nspeak  of economy in the wrong places. Our wealth\r\n\r\nhas  permitted us this year to give back  to  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses - thanks to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe    Minister    for   Finance - the    business\r\n\r\nregistration  fees of $2 million a  year.

This privileged class has  had\r\n\r\n$2 million given back to them, and no more money\r\n\r\nis  to  be contributed by them next year or  the\r\n\r\nyear  after.

If the rule is that public assistance\r\n\r\nis  to be given only to a citizen, we will  also\r\n\r\nhave  to  apply the same rule to the person  who\r\n\r\nsuffers  from  T.B. and exclude the non-citizen.\r\n\r\nIn  order  to get over that difficulty, payments\r\n\r\nhave  been made in very deserving cases to  non-citizens  suffering from T.B. from  the  Silver\r\n\r\nJubilee Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of community centres, I think\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson has made an accusation that\r\n\r\nthese centres are for political activities. I do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether  the  hon.  Member  has  ever\r\n\r\nvisited  a  community  centre  to  see  how   it\r\n\r\noperates. If he goes into one, he\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  see  that there are all sorts of activities\r\n\r\ngoing on. There are young persons engaged in  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  handicraft work.  There  are  activity\r\n\r\ninstructors engaged in all the community  centres\r\n\r\nand  they do very valuable work. Handicraft  work\r\n\r\nis  not  political  activity.  Sewing  is  not  a\r\n\r\npolitical  activity.  Basket  work   is   not   a\r\n\r\npolitical activity. Radio engineering  is  not  a\r\n\r\npolitical  activity. I wish the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nwill really go round the community centres to see\r\n\r\nwhat  is  going on, and once he does so, he  will\r\n\r\nchange his mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now, the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister gave us an assurance  that\r\n\r\nthe  activities in the community centres will not\r\n\r\nbe   of  a  political  nature.  We  welcome  this\r\n\r\nassurance, but there are three points on which  I\r\n\r\nwant to be clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has now lost the support of the\r\n\r\npeople  and  no one goes to the branches  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  The branches are now closed at night  and\r\n\r\ntheir   officials  have  gone  to  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that there are many\r\n\r\ncommunity   centres  and  their   officials   are\r\n\r\nofficials of P.A.P. branches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour,  in his reply, said that in view  of  the\r\n\r\nstrike  of employees of the People's Association,\r\n\r\nthe   People's  Association  has  recruited  many\r\n\r\nvoluntary workers to help in the running  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres. He said that these  voluntary\r\n\r\nworkers  are paid $4 allowance, and all  of  them\r\n\r\nare not P.A.P. members. As far as I know, many of\r\n\r\nthese   paid  workers,  the  so-called  executive\r\n\r\nsecretaries, are, on the one hand,  paid  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., and, on the other hand, are also paid  by\r\n\r\nthe   People's  Association.  Many  of  them  are\r\n\r\nworking in the community centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government can clarify these three\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche M. Ismail Rahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche M. Ismail Rahim (Geylang East)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to reply to the\r\n\r\nMember for Havelock. He says that it is not  true\r\n\r\nthat P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbranches  have closed down and that it is  merely\r\n\r\na  falsehood.

It is not the people who have  defected\r\n\r\nto  the Barisan Sosialis but merely the executive\r\n\r\ncommittee  that  has  gone over  to  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, when the Member for Geylang East stood up to\r\n\r\nreply, I thought he was replying on behalf of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Now  I see that he  is  replying  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the  Party, and  making  an  official\r\n\r\nadmission  that all the members of the  executive\r\n\r\ncommittees of the branches of the P.A.P. have now\r\n\r\ncome  over to the Barisan Sosialis. I am indebted\r\n\r\nto him for that explanation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my real purpose now is to make one point\r\n\r\nonly, and that concerns the Minister's reply that\r\n\r\nthe  T.B. allowance  cannot  be  given  to  non-citizens,  because, if the Government decides  to\r\n\r\ngive  the T.B. allowance to non-citizens, it  has\r\n\r\nalso  got to give public assistance allowance  to\r\n\r\nnon-citizens as well. I am very disturbed by such\r\n\r\nan  analogy and such logic, because basically the\r\n\r\npurposes  of  giving public assistance  allowance\r\n\r\nand T.B. allowance are different. In the case  of\r\n\r\npublic  assistance allowance, it is  given  as  a\r\n\r\nwelfare  aid  scheme.  On  the  other  hand,  the\r\n\r\ntuberculosis allowance is given as a welfare  aid\r\n\r\nscheme  only secondarily, but primarily  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of eradicating tuberculosis in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt is what we call in medical words a therapeutic\r\n\r\nallowance, because if T.B. allowance is given  to\r\n\r\nthose  people  who are infected with tuberculosis\r\n\r\nso that they may get well, the result would be an\r\n\r\neradication of the reservoir of infection so that\r\n\r\nother people in Singapore may not be infected  by\r\n\r\nthe  infected people. Therefore, not to give non-citizens  a  T.B. allowance  would  defeat   the\r\n\r\npurpose of the allowance itself, because  if  one\r\n\r\nsection of the reservoir of infection remains, it\r\n\r\nstill serves to spread the disease. For the last\r\n\r\ntwo  years  I  have been trying .to convince  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour  and  Law  then,  and   the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Health  and  Law  now,   of   the\r\n\r\nimportance of the therapeutic\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\naspect of the allowance.

This is a question that we understand.  We\r\n\r\nare  not  ivory  from  the shoulder  upwards.  We\r\n\r\nunderstand all these problems and we know how  to\r\n\r\ntackle them. The point is this, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  make  a logical distinction,  however\r\n\r\nhard  we try, between granting T.B. allowance  to\r\n\r\nnon-citizens  and  denying  non-citizens   public\r\n\r\nassistance.  We cannot explain such a distinction\r\n\r\nto  the  public, Mr Speaker, Sir. They will  not\r\n\r\nunderstand it even if we tried to so explain.

But what I said  just  now  was\r\n\r\nthat, although some were voluntary workers,  they\r\n\r\nwere  paid $4 each per day. Among these voluntary\r\n\r\nworkers,  several were paid executive members  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. I have raised this question in  order\r\n\r\nto  ask  how it is possible for a person  to  get\r\n\r\npaid from the P.A.P. on the one hand, and on  the\r\n\r\nother   hand,  to  get  paid  from  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs said that some\r\n\r\nMembers  now on strike are irresponsible.  It  is\r\n\r\nregrettable  for him to say so. We can  recollect\r\n\r\nthat several months ago, there was a big fire  at\r\n\r\nBukit  Ho  Swee.  Without the  workers  from  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association, who worked  hard  day  and\r\n\r\nnight,  I  believe the relief work at  that  time\r\n\r\ncould  not have been carried out so smoothly.  At\r\n\r\nthat time I heard several Ministers praise highly\r\n\r\nsome of these workers who are now on strike.  How\r\n\r\ncan   they   say  now  that  these  workers   are\r\n\r\nirresponsible?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister for Home Affairs also\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  People's  Association  have  not\r\n\r\nrecruited new members of the staff.

Now  I  wonder  who  is   right - the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home Affairs or the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that none of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nmembers  have come forward to assist in the  work\r\n\r\nof  the community centres. Of course, this is but\r\n\r\nnatural,  because  at present the  staff  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association are on strike. That  cannot\r\n\r\nbe denied. You may try to argue about it, but you\r\n\r\njust  cannot deny it and convince the people that\r\n\r\nthey are not on strike.

It  is  a\r\n\r\nsimple question. Do not evade. Maybe he does not\r\n\r\nmean  to  evade, but to me it is  tantamount  to\r\n\r\nevasion.   Will  the  Government  undertake   to\r\n\r\nappoint  a  Commission of  Inquiry  on  its  own\r\n\r\nterms,  quite naturally, Sir, after  considering\r\n\r\nany  terms of reference which might be suggested\r\n\r\nby  the  Barisan Sosialis, since he  insists  on\r\n\r\nthem,  and he will not accept any from  me - I  do\r\n\r\nnot  mind,  Sir.

They  have patterned  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  as  the Ministry of Propaganda,  seeking\r\n\r\nthrough  selective and false reporting to  create\r\n\r\nan  atmosphere favourable to the P.A.P. Party and\r\n\r\nto  the P.A.P. front bench. The word \"culture\" is\r\n\r\na  misnomer.  It  is, in fact, a party  political\r\n\r\nmachine and a Government propaganda machine.

That\r\n\r\nis dishonest reporting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not listen out of\r\n\r\nconsideration for myself to Radio P.A.P.  I  have\r\n\r\nunfortunately  had occasion to  hear  reports  of\r\n\r\nwhat   had   transpired.  On  one  occasion,   by\r\n\r\naccident,  I did listen and I considered  that  a\r\n\r\ncertain  part  was  a gross misrepresentation.  I\r\n\r\nwrote to the Head of the News Division asking for\r\n\r\na copy of the transcript of what was broadcast. I\r\n\r\nwas informed that the Ministry would not release,\r\n\r\nnot  even  to  Members maligned,  copies  of  the\r\n\r\ntranscript  of  what  was  broadcast  over   this\r\n\r\npolitical  radio organisation. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen   there   is  a  legitimate   or   seemingly\r\n\r\nlegitimate complaint particularly by a Member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  about  a radio  broadcast,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that he should at least  be  permitted\r\n\r\nthe  right  of  inspection of the  transcript  in\r\n\r\norder  to  ascertain to what extent he  has  been\r\n\r\nmisrepresented or maligned. I have to inform you,\r\n\r\nSir,  that I did mention to the Head of the Radio\r\n\r\nDivision and to the Head of Radio Singapore  that\r\n\r\nI  required inspection for the purposes of making\r\n\r\nknown  to  this Assembly - which was then sitting - the facts, and I was refused. Not until four days\r\n\r\nafterwards did the Minister approach me and  say,\r\n\r\n\"You  can have the inspection now.\" By that time,\r\n\r\nSir,  as you are aware, a motion that the  matter\r\n\r\nhad  suddenly arisen would not have been accepted\r\n\r\nby  you and could not have been accepted by  you.\r\n\r\nIt  would have meant a substantive motion and  it\r\n\r\nwould  have meant resuscitating what was  already\r\n\r\ndead. I say that that sort of approach is not  an\r\n\r\nhonest  and  proper approach and  is  lacking  in\r\n\r\nadequate  consideration not only for  Assemblymen\r\n\r\nbut for all those who may be maligned - as they are - by the radio organ of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore have suffered, and\r\n\r\nsuffered grievously, from the diarrhoea of words\r\n\r\nwhich  the  P.A.P. has poured through its  radio\r\n\r\norgan day\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nafter  day,  and from the hysteria  of  Communism\r\n\r\nspearheaded by their Prime Minister.

Perhaps  the  Minister\r\n\r\ndoes  not  understand culture, and  that  is  why\r\n\r\nsomeone else answered for him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Education said that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  was trying to  promote  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities among the various communities. At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, he said the Government had never heard\r\n\r\nof  any  complaints from any cultural  body.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I believe everybody will agree that\r\n\r\nwe  must have a Malayan culture. In the course of\r\n\r\npromoting this Malayan culture, we should not  do\r\n\r\nanything   to  the  disadvantage  of  a   certain\r\n\r\nculture,  and talk about it in the Assembly  now,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  still do not know what form  Malayan\r\n\r\nculture  will take. This will depend on  how  the\r\n\r\ncultures  of the various communities  develop  in\r\n\r\nfuture.  Therefore, in respect of this  question,\r\n\r\nnamely, the future of Malayan culture, we  should\r\n\r\nnot stress the culture of a certain community and\r\n\r\npraise or denounce its merits, because this  will\r\n\r\nonly lead to certain misunderstanding and perhaps\r\n\r\nto some disastrous results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  has just now said that last  year  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture approved a drama called \"Ch'i\r\n\r\nYen\" and allowed it to be played on the stage  of\r\n\r\nthe  Victoria  Memorial Theatre. This  drama  was\r\n\r\npresented  by  the students -of the Chinese  High\r\n\r\nSchool. I saw the drama myself, perhaps with  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation.  According to information received  by\r\n\r\nme,  the  Ministry of Home Affairs nearly refused\r\n\r\nto  allow  this  drama  to  be  staged.  But  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture, in order to show  that  he\r\n\r\nwas  encouraging cultural activities,  asked  the\r\n\r\nSpecial\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBranch to approve the staging of this particular\r\n\r\ndrama. During the course of its presentation  on\r\n\r\nthe   stage,  the  Government  ruled  that   the\r\n\r\ncontents  of  this drama should not be  stressed\r\n\r\ntoo  much and that certain aspects of it  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  dramatised. I do not know  whether  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  can guarantee any future stagings  of\r\n\r\nthis  drama,  and  whether in future  Government\r\n\r\nwill  still have regulations and conditions when\r\n\r\ngiving permission for this drama to be staged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the debate last week, I\r\n\r\npointed out that the policies of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture  and  the Ministry of Home Affairs  were\r\n\r\ncontradictory. As far as I know, there will be a\r\n\r\ndrama  staged  at the Victoria Memorial  Theatre\r\n\r\nnext year. The title is \"The Song of the Coconut\r\n\r\nForest\" - \"Yeh Lin Chiao Kerh\". According to  what\r\n\r\nwe  know,  the  Government has not allowed  this\r\n\r\nplay  to be staged. But, Mr Speaker, the  whole\r\n\r\nplay is based on the local situation, namely,  a\r\n\r\npresentation of the lives and activities of  the\r\n\r\npeople,   which   the  Minister  concerned   has\r\n\r\nprofessed to encourage. But this play  has  been\r\n\r\nbanned. This morning I went to a book-store'  to\r\n\r\nbuy  a  book  on this play. I have  not  made  a\r\n\r\ncareful study of its contents, and therefore  am\r\n\r\nnot  sure whether they are as undesirable as the\r\n\r\nMinister  has claimed them to be. And I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether they are similar to those  in  the\r\n\r\nbook  called  \"The Reminiscences of Fire\"  which\r\n\r\nwas banned by the Minister concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I cannot understand the\r\n\r\nMember  for Choa Chu Kang.

Unless the Ministry knows exactly  what\r\n\r\nit  wants  and  what is to be achieved,  this  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be a waste of money. From what the  ex-Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCulture has said, it looks as if culture to  them\r\n\r\nmeans songs, dances and things having relation to\r\n\r\nthe  stage. This is not true, Sir. Culture  is  a\r\n\r\nway  of life. The work of the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nis  to promote goodwill and understanding between\r\n\r\nthe   different   races,  and   to   promote   an\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the way of life of the different\r\n\r\nraces.  Probably the putting up  of  the  dances,\r\n\r\nsongs and art of the different races does promote\r\n\r\nan  understanding of the different races in Singa\r\n\r\npore. But I have asked this question a couple  of\r\n\r\nyears   ago.   It   has   never   been   answered\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily.  I  wonder  whether  it  can   be\r\n\r\nanswered  today.  What does the  ex-Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary mean when he says, in effect,  that  he\r\n\r\nhopes that a Malayan culture is to be born in the\r\n\r\nfuture  out  of the different cultures  that  are\r\n\r\nbeing  displayed today? Does he  mean  a  Chinese\r\n\r\ndance  more  malayanised or an Indian dance  more\r\n\r\nChinese? What is the Ministry's idea of a Malayan\r\n\r\nculture or a Malayan dance that they are going to\r\n\r\npromote  out of all these Malay, Indian,  Chinese\r\n\r\nand  European dances? Have they a clear  idea  of\r\n\r\nwhat  exactly is their aim when they  talk  about\r\n\r\nthe birth of a new Malayan culture?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfirstly, let me say that I sincerely congratulate\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson who, I know, is a well-known\r\n\r\nlawyer.  He  now  professes to be  an  expert  in\r\n\r\nmatters  of  culture. In his speech, he  mentions\r\n\r\nThat he greatly respects all the various cultures\r\n\r\nexisting  in  Singapore. I support  him  in  that\r\n\r\nrespect.  But if you read his speech between  the\r\n\r\nlines,   he  is  insinuating  that  the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  ignoring  the  cultures  of   the\r\n\r\nvarious races. This will\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstir  up  communal feelings. I still remember - I\r\n\r\nhave forgotten the title of the book - that there\r\n\r\nare  cultural leaders who say that  colonialism\r\n\r\ncannot eradicate a nation unless the culture of\r\n\r\nthat  particular nation is wiped out. A  nation\r\n\r\ncannot   be  continuously  colonised   by   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists  unless, first and  foremost,  the\r\n\r\nculture of that particular nation is colonised.\r\n\r\nThis has a great influence on the culture of  a\r\n\r\nnation.  For that reason, Mr Speaker,  because\r\n\r\nthe  question of culture is very important, let\r\n\r\nus   not  discuss  something  which  will  have\r\n\r\ndetrimental  consequences to  our  cosmopolitan\r\n\r\nsociety. We do not wish political influences to\r\n\r\naffect  the  people  into  thinking  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   trying  to  destroy   Chinese\r\n\r\nculture,  and  similarly that it is  trying  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  Tamil culture or Indian  culture.  Let\r\n\r\nthe Government be damned if it wants to destroy\r\n\r\nMalay  culture.  This has been uttered  by  the\r\n\r\nvarious political leaders during election  time\r\n\r\nin  order  to get votes. They tell the  Chinese\r\n\r\npeople  not  to  forget  their  culture  of   a\r\n\r\nthousand  years  old,  and  that  they  have  a\r\n\r\ntraditional culture of their own. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nlet  us not try to revive communal feelings  if\r\n\r\nwe are sincere in our efforts to build a united\r\n\r\nnation with an undivided loyalty to this  land.\r\n\r\nTo  build  a  Malayan culture is not  a  simple\r\n\r\nmatter.  It will take a long time to  evolve  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  culture. It cannot be achieved  during\r\n\r\nthe short space of few hours or a few days.  To\r\n\r\ncreate  a  Malayan culture out of  the  various\r\n\r\ncultures  and the various religious beliefs  is\r\n\r\nsurely not an easy matter. As suggested by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson, by the creation of a Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture,  a  united Malayan  culture  could\r\n\r\neasily  be developed. The creation of a culture\r\n\r\ncannot be forced upon the people. As one leader\r\n\r\ndid say on one occasion, \"I\r\n\r\ncan  influence thousands, in fact, millions  of\r\n\r\npeople  to respect me, but I cannot force  them\r\n\r\nto  smile at me because such a smile comes from\r\n\r\nthe  bottom  of  their hearts.\"  Likewise,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the  question of culture.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nforce any kind of culture upon the people.  The\r\n\r\npeople  themselves must voluntarily accept  the\r\n\r\nculture, a culture which they\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthemselves  wish  to  make as  the  basis  for  a\r\n\r\nMalayan nation. Therefore, a national culture can\r\n\r\nonly be born from a sincere and honest desire  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  who wish to practise it and  without\r\n\r\nits being forced on them. Therefore, in a country\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore,  where there is  a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety,  we must have a Ministry of Culture.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  for  the  purpose of forcing  a  certain\r\n\r\nculture   upon  the  people.  But   it   is   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of this Ministry to  bring  about\r\n\r\ngoodwill  and understanding between  the  various\r\n\r\nraces so that they can live in harmony and peace.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if they do not know one another, there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no  feelings  of  love.  So  the  first\r\n\r\nresponsibility of this Ministry is  to  introduce\r\n\r\nthe   culture   of  the  various   people   among\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, if plays are performed by\r\n\r\nMalays,  the  audience  are  limited  to  Malays;\r\n\r\nsimilarly  with the Chinese and the Indians.  But\r\n\r\nwith the creation of this Ministry of Culture, we\r\n\r\ncan  stage  the dances of the various  races  and\r\n\r\nhave  an audience composed of the various  races.\r\n\r\nIf  the Chinese put up a lion dance play, it does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that  it will swallow up  the  Malays.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the Malays perform the art of self-defence, it does not mean that it is stabbing the\r\n\r\nChinese.  If they can understand the  meaning  of\r\n\r\nthe  word \"art\", then they will not be afraid  of\r\n\r\nthe lion dance nor will they fear the art of self-defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first and primary job of culture is to\r\n\r\nintroduce  the  various cultures. We  should  not\r\n\r\nforget that to create a Malayan culture the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  factor is language.  Language  is  the\r\n\r\ninstrument to unite all races for the purpose  of\r\n\r\ncreating  culture.  For that reason,  it  is  our\r\n\r\ndeclared   policy  that  Malay  be  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage.  If this can be practised  as  a  first\r\n\r\nstep - we  are  going to have  National  Language\r\n\r\nWeek - then  I  am  confident, Mr Speaker,  that  this\r\n\r\nmatter   will  be  resolved  with  the  best   of\r\n\r\nintentions. Language reflects the nation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Speaker, when talking about\r\n\r\nall these matters, we must have a people who owe\r\n\r\ntheir  allegiance  to  this  country.  If   they\r\n\r\nrealise  that they will live and die here,  then\r\n\r\nthe spirit of compromise will emerge between the\r\n\r\nvarious  races. After that it will be  easy.  We\r\n\r\nhave  been  segregated by the  colonialists.  We\r\n\r\nshould  not forget the old diseases left by  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists  and  which  cannot  be  eradicated\r\n\r\nquickly.  I  wish to warn all political  leaders\r\n\r\nnot to stir up communal feelings in cultural and\r\n\r\nreligious  matters which may lead to undesirable\r\n\r\nconsequences in our multi-racial society. I hope\r\n\r\nthey will not use this means for political ends.\r\n\r\nThey  will  win,  but  let  us  not  forget  the\r\n\r\ndisastrous  consequences. For that  reason,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I very much regret the speech  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson. In the beginning  he  has\r\n\r\nsaid  he  has  all the respect for  the  various\r\n\r\ncultures. Then he alleges that the Government is\r\n\r\nkilling  Chinese culture. I hope  this  sort  of\r\n\r\nthing will not happen in our community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  last speaker tells you he regrets  my\r\n\r\nspeech.  Sir, I would like to say there  is  one\r\n\r\nspeech   from  the  Opposition  which  I  really\r\n\r\nenjoyed.  It was a magnificent speech, and  with\r\n\r\nmuch of it I agree -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> From the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir, from the\r\n\r\nopposite  benches. Sir, there are two  or  three\r\n\r\nmisunderstandings.  I  did  not  say  that   the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  a  Malayan culture  was  easy.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  not.  At  no time  it  is  to  my  mind\r\n\r\nimpossible  for  any group to create.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of evolution of time. Nor did  I  single\r\n\r\nout  Chinese  culture as being attacked  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. But there is one aspect with which I\r\n\r\nmust  disagree with the Member. Sir, he has  the\r\n\r\nright  approach  when  he  says,  do  not   stir\r\n\r\ncommunal   issues;  they  could  have  dangerous\r\n\r\nrepercussions. That is true. But, Sir, there  is\r\n\r\na  far  greater danger in allowing an  ulcer  to\r\n\r\nfester  quietly than to lance it. I  say  it  is\r\n\r\nwise  to  bring  into  the  open  the  deep-felt\r\n\r\nemotional\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nanger about certain aspects of Government policy.\r\n\r\nIt  clears  the air and it also shows  Government\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Opposition  and  some  people  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry  think.

Nobody complains; therefore, it is  all\r\n\r\nright. The question of communal issues is like  a\r\n\r\nnettle.  Grasp it firmly, grasp it cleanly,  deal\r\n\r\nwith it honestly, do not pursue it beyond what is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  make the point. Sir,  we  disagree\r\n\r\nthere,  and  he is entitled to his views.  To  my\r\n\r\nmind,  it is healthy and it is necessary to raise\r\n\r\nan issue of that character.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of course, I agree with the last speaker\r\n\r\nthat we need a Ministry of Culture, but I say  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  need  a  Ministry of P.A.P.  Propaganda.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  distinction. We need a Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture.  I  agree  with him  completely  in  his\r\n\r\nassessment  of some of the aspects of work  which\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Culture could achieve but which,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  the  Ministry  is  not   pursuing\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Member for Kampong Kapor - I am\r\n\r\nsorry;  I  think he holds an office in Government\r\n\r\nwhich I have definitely forgotten.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> He is the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto the Minister for Culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Culture?

That is not correct, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the Member for Choa Chu Kang said that  we\r\n\r\nshould  allow  the  mutual  interflow  of   the\r\n\r\ncultures of the various communities and not try\r\n\r\nto stress their merits or defects. I agree with\r\n\r\nthis very much. But then he alleged that we had\r\n\r\ninterfered with the free staging of dramas  and\r\n\r\nplays   in  Singapore.  We  have  an  executive\r\n\r\ncommittee. When an application by any  organisa\r\n\r\ntion  to  stage any programme is  refused,  the\r\n\r\ndecision can be reviewed by this committee.  As\r\n\r\nfar as I know, there is a\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbook-stall  in Singapore - I think I can  tell  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Choa Chu Kang that it is  the  Youth\r\n\r\nBook  Store - which has published  many  works  and\r\n\r\nbooks  by  local artistes. According  to  what  I\r\n\r\nknow, the Government has banned only two of these\r\n\r\nplays.  One  describes  how  the  police  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya used their gun  barrels  to\r\n\r\nmurder rubber tappers who were unarmed. But  this\r\n\r\nkind  of  action in this environment of ours,  in\r\n\r\nthis  multi-racial society of  ours,  is  perhaps\r\n\r\nthat of the Communists in the Federation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point the Member for Choa Chu Kang has\r\n\r\nraised is about dances. We have only banned those\r\n\r\ndances  which were imported from Communist  China\r\n\r\npraising  Mao Tse-Tung and the People's  Republic\r\n\r\nof  China. If we allow this kind of publications,\r\n\r\ndances or dramas or plays to be imported into our\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  society,  it  perhaps   may   cause\r\n\r\nsuspicion   among  the  Malays  and   the   other\r\n\r\ncommunities.  Another  play  was  about   certain\r\n\r\nstrikes. This was written by a local play-wright.\r\n\r\nNow  we are encouraging that all kinds of strikes\r\n\r\nshould   be   settled  by  peaceful   means   and\r\n\r\nnegotiations. For instance, a book describes  how\r\n\r\nthe  strikes  in  1956 were staged  and  how  the\r\n\r\npolice  used force to cause bloodshed and so  on,\r\n\r\nwould  such  a book be desirable in  the  present\r\n\r\ncircumstances?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is that before we approve any\r\n\r\nitem  of programme to be staged, we have to  take\r\n\r\ninto regard our ultimate objective of merger with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of Malaya. In this  respect,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  see  to  it  that  we  have  favourable\r\n\r\nconditions and an environment that are  conducive\r\n\r\nto  merger,  and not try to cause any  suspicions\r\n\r\namong any races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the total sum to be\r\n\r\nallocated for Head 49 be reduced by $100.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee divided: Ayes, 18; Noes, 23;\r\n\r\nAbstention, Nil; Absent, 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ayes.

Everywhere  that  I\r\n\r\ncould see in the places where I saw these troops,\r\n\r\nthe strikers were completely peaceful. Sir, there\r\n\r\nwas  no  need to use, troops at all so far  as  I\r\n\r\ncould  judge, and the police were adequate. Again\r\n\r\nthis  morning  we  see  newspaper  pictures   and\r\n\r\nreports  of troops being used in the eviction  of\r\n\r\n42  individuals. Surely, Sir, our Police Force is\r\n\r\nadequate.

The White  Paper  is  quite\r\n\r\nclear on that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the use of troops. They were\r\n\r\nnecessary in the City Council strike, because  on\r\n\r\nthe first day of the strike, strikers resorted to\r\n\r\nillegal  methods of intimidation. It  was,  there\r\n\r\nfore,  necessary to mount a show  of  force,  and\r\n\r\nthis had an immediate salutary effect. After this\r\n\r\ndemonstration of strength, the strikers in  their\r\n\r\npicketing action complied strictly with the  law,\r\n\r\nwith  the result that we went through that strike\r\n\r\npeacefully and without incident after the  second\r\n\r\nday.

Members  will recollect,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  during the years 1955-56  when  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson was at the helm of State,  we\r\n\r\nsaw  him  being chased from pillar to post.  He\r\n\r\ntried  to  please people who were not there  to\r\n\r\nargue in a reasonable and logical way. He tried\r\n\r\nto  deceive  himself into believing that,  when\r\n\r\nyou are confronted with a political force which\r\n\r\nis, not out to seek a reasonable settlement  of\r\n\r\nissues, you can argue with them, you can  treat\r\n\r\nthem   as   reasonable   people   across    the\r\n\r\nnegotiating  table.

The objective\r\n\r\nis to subdue any thought of illegal resistance - to\r\n\r\nconvince   the  persons  against  whom   such   a\r\n\r\ndemonstration of force is necessary, that  it  is\r\n\r\nquite  unprofitable  for them  to  mount  illegal\r\n\r\nresistance.  If  we had relied  on  the  innocent\r\n\r\napproach recommended by the Member for Anson,  we\r\n\r\ncould have perhaps sent a couple of policemen  to\r\n\r\neach of these Work Brigade camps and tell them to\r\n\r\nbehave   themselves.  Far  from  achieving   this\r\n\r\nobjective, Mr Speaker, Sir, might I say that the\r\n\r\nresult would be that the mutinous members of  the\r\n\r\nBrigade  might  have  been tempted,  or  probably\r\n\r\nwould  have  been tempted, to assault  policemen,\r\n\r\nthe arm of the law; the police on whom we rely to\r\n\r\nenforce   law  and  order?  It  was,   therefore,\r\n\r\nnecessary in this exercise to have such a show of\r\n\r\noverwhelming strength that even the most reckless\r\n\r\nof  the  members of the Brigade would  have  been\r\n\r\nbrought  immediately to their senses and complied\r\n\r\nwith the orders which had been lawfully given  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not regard this\r\n\r\nexercise  with any particular pride or happiness,\r\n\r\nthis  series  of events in the Work  Brigade.

We hope that by 1963 the Minister  will\r\n\r\nhave   enough  trained  staff  to,  prevent  this\r\n\r\ninstability of staffing in the schools. Sir, this\r\n\r\ninstability   of   staffing   has   led   to   an\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  state  of affairs.  If  heads  of\r\n\r\nschools  are transferred after one or two  years,\r\n\r\nand sometimes only after a few months, or trained\r\n\r\nteachers are taken from one school to reinforce a\r\n\r\nnew  school,  although the Ministry may  find  it\r\n\r\nnecessary,  yet  from the point of  view  of  the\r\n\r\nparents  and the students, the whole position  is\r\n\r\nnot satisfactory. Sir, judging from the point  of\r\n\r\nview of the heads and the teachers themselves, if\r\n\r\nthey  know  they are going to be in a school  for\r\n\r\nthree  or five years, they will think not of  the\r\n\r\nshort-term   objective,  but  of  the   long-term\r\n\r\nobjective.  They know that if they plan  a  thing\r\n\r\nand  carry it out, they will be able to  see  the\r\n\r\nresults. But if they have no such certainty, they\r\n\r\nwill  reason  out  that it  is  no  use  planning\r\n\r\nsomething if they are\r\n\r\nnot  going to be there to see the fruits of  what\r\n\r\nthey  have  sown. The result of such instability,\r\n\r\nSir, is that the heads regard themselves as stop-gap measures, and the best thing to do is to keep\r\n\r\nthe  machinery  moving with the result  that  the\r\n\r\nchildren and the schools suffer. From\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe point of view of the parents, they feel that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot identify the school as being linked\r\n\r\nup with a certain head\r\n\r\nor  a certain senior teacher; the staffing is so fluid  that  they themselves get  confused.  The\r\n\r\nchildren,  like little children  who  see  their\r\n\r\nparents  changing and their nurses changing  all\r\n\r\nthe time, have also a sense of instability and a\r\n\r\nlack of continuity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would suggest that, as soon as trained\r\n\r\nteachers  are  sufficient,  the  schools  be  so\r\n\r\norganised  that  they have  teams  of  heads  of\r\n\r\nschools  and  teachers  stablised  round   them,\r\n\r\nbecause  unless there is this kind of stability,\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid, Sir, we will not be able to  have\r\n\r\nefficiency,  co-ordination  and  the   long-term\r\n\r\ninterest of the students and the community round\r\n\r\nthese schools looked after. This is a suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  I  make  for the Minister's consideration,\r\n\r\nbecause we have found that where a school has  a\r\n\r\nstable  staff and a head who knows that he  will\r\n\r\nbe  there  for some years, there can be  maximum\r\n\r\nefficiency, continuity, a team spirit, a  family\r\n\r\nspirit  produced  and  a community  round  these\r\n\r\nschools. We also feel that the school belongs to\r\n\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\ndo  not intend to raise under this amendment  the\r\n\r\nmany  faults  and deficiencies of this  Ministry.\r\n\r\nThis will be dealt with in the substantive motion\r\n\r\nseeking  a  Commission. But this afternoon  I  do\r\n\r\nrise  on  what  may  seem  a  minor  matter,  but\r\n\r\nnevertheless it is important to many parents.  In\r\n\r\n1959,  Mr  Speaker,  many  students  failed  the\r\n\r\nSecondary School Entrance Examination. They  were\r\n\r\ntold that they would be posted to Post Primary  I\r\n\r\nand  thereafter  to Post Primary II.  They  under\r\n\r\nstood  that after Post Primary II, having  passed\r\n\r\nit, they would be allowed to join the main stream\r\n\r\nin the secondary schools. Sir, I myself have very\r\n\r\nlittle  knowledge  of these aspects,  but  I  was\r\n\r\napproached  by a parent and he drew my  attention\r\n\r\nto  the  fact that his daughter, who was  one  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  failed  in 1959, was  put  into  Post\r\n\r\nPrimary I in 1960, did well, went to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nPost  Primary II in 1961, did well, and  in  fact\r\n\r\nshe  was  amongst the top 25 or 30 per cent.  But\r\n\r\ndespite  this, she has received a letter  telling\r\n\r\nher  that she has been dismissed from the  school\r\n\r\nand she could not be considered for a transfer to\r\n\r\na secondary school since the standard of the Post\r\n\r\nPrimary  II examination is below that of  Primary VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, she is not the only one affected.\r\n\r\nI understand a large number of them are affected.\r\n\r\nI  wrote to the Minister on the 4th of September.\r\n\r\nThat  was two weeks ago, Sir,I have not had  the\r\n\r\ncourtesy of an acknowledgement or a reply. It  is\r\n\r\ntrue  he is busy, but I had anticipated at  least\r\n\r\nthat  somebody  would have replied  pointing  out\r\n\r\nwhat  the  true  position is,  if,  in  fact,  my\r\n\r\ninformation is inaccurate. The unhappy  position,\r\n\r\nSir,  is this. If those two years, 1960 and 1961,\r\n\r\nwere  in  fact  inadequate to  bring  her  up  to\r\n\r\nsecondary school standard, which she had taken in\r\n\r\n1959,  they  were a fraud upon the  child  and  a\r\n\r\nfraud upon the parents. Secondly, they were given\r\n\r\nthe  impression,  Sir, and  I  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  this is correct, that these Post-Primary\r\n\r\nclasses  were to equip the students to cope  with\r\n\r\nsecondary school curricula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to put\r\n\r\ntwo points to the Minister. Although this expendi\r\n\r\nture  is  for  1963,  I  hope  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  will  implement it during  this  year.\r\n\r\nMany  parents  have complained that the  students\r\n\r\nare  required to use a particular school  uniform\r\n\r\nand  that  the cloth can only be bought from  one\r\n\r\nshop.   This  is  inconveniencing  poor  parents,\r\n\r\nbecause  that particular shop will  then  have  a\r\n\r\nmonopoly. I think the best thing for all students\r\n\r\nin  Singapore to do is to use one school  uniform\r\n\r\nfor  the  sake  of convenience, so  that  when  a\r\n\r\nstudent   is  transferred  from  one  school   to\r\n\r\nanother,  there  will be no need  to  change  his\r\n\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the purchase of textbooks, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. This is a source of hardship  to  poor\r\n\r\nparents.  If  a student is in Primary!  V  this\r\n\r\nyear  and  he has a younger brother in  Primary\r\n\r\nIV, the child in Primary IV will not be able to\r\n\r\nuse  his  brother's books when he  goes  up  to\r\n\r\nPrimary V. I do not know why the textbooks keep\r\n\r\non  changing  every  year. This  is  merely  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  the  printers at the  expense  of  the\r\n\r\nparents. I hope the Ministry of Education  will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  resolve  this  problem  in  order  to\r\n\r\nalleviate the hardships of the parents most  of\r\n\r\nwhom cannot afford to buy textbooks. If the old\r\n\r\ntextbooks can be used, it will be a great  help\r\n\r\nto those parents who have many children.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to reply\r\n\r\nvery   briefly,  first,  to  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nTanglin's  remark  regarding  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\ntrained staff, which he hopes would be overcome\r\n\r\nby  1963.  That,  I think, is a  forlorn  hope,\r\n\r\nbecause, according to the Four-Year Development\r\n\r\nPlan   we  have  indicated  that  it  will   be\r\n\r\nnecessary   to  recruit  no  less  than   1,000\r\n\r\nteachers  each year. Because of the large  size\r\n\r\nof  our admission per year - between 55,000  and\r\n\r\n60,000   children - and  about  20,000  leaving\r\n\r\nschool,  we  have therefore a net increase  per\r\n\r\nyear  of something like 35,000 students.  At  a\r\n\r\nrough ratio of 1 teacher to 30 or 35 pupils per\r\n\r\nclass,  we  must have at least 1,000  teachers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we have to recruit 1,000 teachers\r\n\r\neach  year, there is no, alternative except  to\r\n\r\ntrain our teachers by the in-service method. On\r\n\r\nthe  whole,  they will have to do 3  years  in-service  training largely for primary  schools.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  each  year we shall  be  having  at\r\n\r\nleast  3,000  teachers under  training  at  the\r\n\r\nTeacher's Training College. So you can see  the\r\n\r\nsize of our problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, we started with 10,000 teachers.\r\n\r\nEvery  year there has been an increase of 1,000\r\n\r\nteachers.  So  by  1963, we  will  have  14,000\r\n\r\nteachers.   Of  the  14,000,  3,000   will   be\r\n\r\nundergoing  training. Much as I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsee trained teachers being produced at the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrate of 1,000 per year, it is not something that\r\n\r\nseems foreseeable in the near future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will reply to the Member for Anson. I\r\n\r\nwish to apologise to him for not having been able\r\n\r\nto   reply   to   his  letter.  He  himself   did\r\n\r\nacknowledge that I have been quite busy in recent\r\n\r\nweeks.  The tone of his letter was rather strong.\r\n\r\nHe used the word \"fraud\" in the provision of Post-Primary classes. Knowing the Member for Anson,  I\r\n\r\ndid feel that when replying to him I should couch\r\n\r\nmy  reply in such words as not to bring about  an\r\n\r\naltercation  with  him outside  the  Assembly.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to assure him, first of all, that  the\r\n\r\nPost-Primary classes were first started  in  1960\r\n\r\nbecause  the  result  of  the  Secondary   School\r\n\r\nEntrance  Examination (as it was known  in  1959,\r\n\r\nand  which has since been changed to the  Primary\r\n\r\nSchool Leaving Examination) was so bad that  only\r\n\r\n31 per cent of the students passed it. Now had we\r\n\r\nattempted  to  follow  the previous  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy,  what would have happened would  be  that\r\n\r\nonly  31  per cent would have gone into secondary\r\n\r\nschools and the remaining 69 per cent - those from\r\n\r\nthe  English primary schools - would have had  to\r\n\r\nfend for themselves in private schools or get out\r\n\r\nof  school  completely. We felt that  that  would\r\n\r\ncreate  a great social problem. So we immediately\r\n\r\ngot together to give these poor kids a chance  to\r\n\r\nstay  in school. Now, the main tragedy was  this.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the automatic promotion system  that\r\n\r\nexisted  in  the  English primary  schools  since\r\n\r\n1951,  I  think what happened was this.  Although\r\n\r\nthey took the so-called Secondary School Entrance\r\n\r\nExamination,  a good percentage of  the  students\r\n\r\nwere  only  of Primary III or Primary  IV  level,\r\n\r\nbecause they were not examined at all. They  just\r\n\r\nmoved  up  year  by  year.  So,  having  provided\r\n\r\nclasses for the nearly 4,000 pupils who\r\n\r\nfailed  the  examination, we did find that  after\r\n\r\none  year in Post-Primary classes, only 200  were\r\n\r\nsalvaged. In other words, we found them  able  to\r\n\r\nkeep  pace  with  the secondary school  students,\r\n\r\nand  they  were siphoned off. But the  rest  were\r\n\r\nsuch  poor material that all we could do  was  to\r\n\r\ngive them another year of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neducation in school. There was no fraud at all.\r\n\r\nWe  were  trying to keep them in school.  After\r\n\r\nthese  two years, they were still not  able  to\r\n\r\ncatch   up  with  the  secondary  stream   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, would have to leave. That really  is\r\n\r\nthe   position,  Sir,  about  the  Post-Primary\r\n\r\nclasses,  and  this  is only  the  transitional\r\n\r\nperiod.  We  intend to put these children  into\r\n\r\nregular  secondary vocational schools  for  two\r\n\r\nyears.  That  is why we had the  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry    into   Vocational   and    Technical\r\n\r\nEducation. Its Report has been tabled, but  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper of the Government has not yet  been\r\n\r\nplaced before this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to reply to the Member for the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands. It is, I think, a very  good\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that  all schools should  have  the\r\n\r\nsame  type of uniform. But there would be  this\r\n\r\ndanger,  that we would be accused of trying  to\r\n\r\nstandardise everyone. Every school has a little\r\n\r\npride about the type of uniform that it designs\r\n\r\nfor  its pupils. But, on the other hand, we  do\r\n\r\nsay  that  no  school should  really  tell  its\r\n\r\npupils  that  t  they must  buy  cloth  from  a\r\n\r\nparticular shop. But generally they  have  some\r\n\r\nlittle understanding in that they get a special\r\n\r\nrebate, and so school children will benefit  by\r\n\r\ngoing  to  a  particular shop  because  of  the\r\n\r\nspecial rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for textbooks, Sir, it is a little\r\n\r\nregrettable  that  there should  be  changes  in\r\n\r\ntextbooks  because we are talking  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  of textbooks. So  it  is  likely\r\n\r\nthat   books  are  being  changed  because   the\r\n\r\nauthorities feel that better types of books  are\r\n\r\nnow   available  and  are  more  in  line   with\r\n\r\nMalayanisation.
