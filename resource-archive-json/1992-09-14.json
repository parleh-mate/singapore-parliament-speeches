In 1991, there were 2,178 reported cases of dengue fever or dengue haemorrhagic fever and six deaths. In the first eight months of this year, there were 1,964 cases and one death. For the same period last year, there were 1,417 cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mosquito breeding within premises is still prevalent. In the first eight months of this year, my officers carried out some 440,000 inspections and found 4,919 instances of breeding. In other words, there were 12 instances of breeding for every 1,000 inspections. Last year, Sir, some 990,000 inspections were carried out and there were 7,273 instances of breeding. This works out to 7 instances for every 1,000 inspections. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to educate the public on the danger of the Aedes mosquito. Vector control operations have also been stepped up. Every day, some 200 Public Health Inspectors are deployed for this purpose. More stringent enforcement action was introduced this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first eight months of this year, 2,268 households with mosquito breeding within their premises were fined. Two repeat offenders were charged in court. Another 1,066 non-residential premises found to be breeding mosquitoes were also dealt with in court. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Eunos GRC):</b> Sir, would the Minister say that the problem is now well under control? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> I would like to say that, but at the moment I think it is still serious. Therefore, we need to get the cooperation of everyone. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, apart from the Aedes mosquito and dengue fever, is there also an increase in the number of cases of malaria? If this is so, could the Minister inform the House what preventive steps are being taken to curtail the spread of malaria? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, malaria is not a problem in Singapore today. Through effective vector control measures by the Ministry of the Environment, we are able to keep the population of Anopheles mosquito, which transmits the disease, very low. Because of this, Singapore was declared malaria-free by WHO in 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All cases of malaria reported in recent years were imported cases. In other words, the victims contracted the disease \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> outside Singapore. My Ministry will continue to be vigilant against the re-introduction of malaria in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of this House, Sir, for some years now, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have been having biennial meetings to discuss and exchange information on malaria. From 1990 onwards, these biennial meetings have been subsumed under the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Singapore (BIMS) Border Health Conference. And for the information of Mr Das, the next BIMS Border Health Conference will be hosted in Singapore in November this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied GRC):</b> May I ask the Minister two supplementary questions? (1) What is the level of public awareness of the danger of Aedes mosquito? (2) Since swing-fogging is an effective method of killing mosquitoes, why is it not frequently used to wipe out Aedes mosquitoes? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, extensive publicity on dengue fever and Aedes mosquito through the print and TV media as well as educational materials that have been widely distributed to members of the public, have indeed heightened awareness amongst the general public. And this was confirmed by results of a survey conducted recently by my Ministry. But, nonetheless, Sir, my Ministry will make special efforts to reach out to as many people as possible, including foreign maids, foreign workers, school principals, grassroots leaders, estate managers, etc. I would like to emphasize, Sir, in order to bring the disease under control we need the support of everyone. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chin is quite right in saying that swing-fogging is currently the most effective method of killing adult mosquitoes. But unless we can literally wipe out all the adult mosquitoes, those that escape will continue to breed if breeding grounds are made available. Then we are back to square one. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in our vector control operations, emphasis is on the permanent elimination of breeding habitats. If we can deny the mosquitoes a chance to breed and multiply, we can \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> keep the mosquito population so low that it no longer poses a threat. That is what we have done in our efforts to control malaria. We are able to keep the Anopheles mosquito population so low that malaria is no longer a problem, as I have said earlier on in my answer to Mr Chandra Das. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the case of the Aedes mosquito, Sir, my Ministry finds the task a bit harder because this species of mosquito breeds mainly in homes and we cannot be present in people's homes all the time to check and make sure that there are no breedings. That is why, in order to bring the disease under control, I must emphasize, once again, that we need the support of everyone. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COOKED FOOD AND MARKET-PRODUCE STALLS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Vacancies)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for the Environment how many cooked food and market-produce stalls under the management of the Housing and Development Board and his Ministry are still vacant and whether these stalls will be re-opened for application. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, currently, markets and food centres that will not be affected by redevelopment have 2,100 vacant stalls, and of these, 327 are cooked food stalls and the remaining 1,773 are market-produce stalls. All vacant cooked food stalls are being reserved for stallholders affected by redevelopment. This is because the number of stallholders to be relocated is more than the vacancies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the market-produce stalls, the Ministry of the Environment is examining how best these vacancies can be taken up. Once finalised, details will be made known. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>REAR SEAT BELT REQUIREMENTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Grace period)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in respect of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the rear seat belt requirements to take effect from 1st October 1992, whether the Traffic Police will consider giving motorists a grace period during which the Traffic Police can conduct a campaign to educate and advise motorists on the need for rear seat belts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the regulation on the use of child restraints in the front seat came into effect on 1st July this year, Traffic Police were aware that this new requirement needed explanation. It was necessary for motorists to know that the rule was in the interests of the safety of their children. Therefore, the Traffic Police gave a grace period during which the offenders were not booked but instead given written advisory notices and cautioned that they would be booked if they were caught again. As a result of this, there has been a high level of compliance with the front seat belt rules. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Arthur Beng as well as Dr Ow Chin Hock, Chairman of the Feedback Unit, have both informed me that the requirement of seat belts for rear seats is more complicated and therefore requires further public education so as to avoid confusion and misunderstanding. For example, some people still have the misperception that the rear seats are safer than the front seats and that therefore there is no real need for this requirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police will next week launch a comprehensive public education programme on the need to use seat belts and child restraints in the rear seats. It will be a major education programme, with television commercials, advertisements in the press, posters and leaflets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was done for the front seat requirements, Traffic Police will also give a grace period for the rear belt rules. During this period, which will be for three months, Traffic Police will exercise flexibility on first time offenders, who will be cautioned and advised of the need to belt up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>APPLICATIONS FOR PERMANENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RESIDENCE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(By male and female spouses of</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>Singapore citizens)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will state the number of applications by male and female spouses of Singapore citizens for permanent residence in 1991; what was the success rate; and if his Ministry is willing to allow the economic and financial status of the Singaporean spouse to be the determining factor in such applications, regardless of sex. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1991, 4,676 female spouses of Singapore citizens applied for permanent residence (PR). The approval rate was 68%. In the same year, 1,284 male spouses of Singapore citizens applied for permanent residence. The approval rate was 57%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second part of the Member's question, Immigration Department does take into account the qualifications and skills of the Singaporean spouse in assessing such PR applications, regardless of whether the spouse is the husband or wife. The only distinction is that where the foreign spouse is the husband he should be gainfully employed and has the means to look after his family. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INVESTMENT IN MOUNT CHARLOTTE GROUP</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will say how much was invested in the Mount Charlotte group and whether the investment has suffered any loss and, if so, what is the extent of the loss so far. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to date the total investment in the Mount Charlotte Group is S$821 million or \u00a3274 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No shares in Mount Charlotte have been sold so that there has been no realised loss. Mount Charlotte is a public limited company but its shares are not currently listed in the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The shares were \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> previously listed in the LSE, but trading in the shares was stopped when the Brierley Group acquired 100% of Mount Charlotte's equity in December 1990. Shareholders' intention is for the company to be refloated at an opportune time in the future in a few years' time and to have its shares relisted on the LSE. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shares in Mount Charlotte were purchased as a long term investment. Therefore, the return from this investment can be determined when Mount Charlotte is relisted on the LSE. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1991 was the most difficult year for UK hotels in 30 years as the tourist industry was badly affected by the Gulf War and the UK recession. Even in 1991, Mount Charlotte operated profitably, increased its average room rate in the key London market and continued to achieve the highest returns on turnover in the industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, it was reported that the hotel occupancy rate had been at its worst since 1980. Why then did the Government decide to buy 30% of Mount Charlotte for around \u00a3237.5 million in May 1991? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> There was a proposal by Mount Charlotte to restructure its debt structure to eliminate a large amount of short-term debts at relatively high interest rates through the issuance of convertible bonds and it was the purchase of these bonds which accounts for this 1991 purchase. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Under what consideration did the Government decide to pump in another \u00a3150 million to save the hotel, as it was reported? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It is a statement which is totally untrue. It is not to save the company. As I mentioned earlier, it was to restructure the debt, to lower the interest burden. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would the Minister estimate how much Singapore could recover from the investment should the hotel be eventually wound up? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It would not be wound up. The hotel will be profitable in a few years' time. I cannot predict what is going to happen in a few years' time. But, hopefully, with the recovery of the hotel market in London, which is incidentally the largest single hotel market in the world, and will remain so even when UK is part of the European Community, it will remain for a long, long time as a major tourist hotel market in Europe. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Can I take it that the Minister is confident that the investment on the hotel would give us a good return by 1995 or 1996? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I cannot predict 1995 or 1996, but the investment would not have been made if we did not have any assumption that it would be profitable in the longer term. But I cannot commit myself to specific dates, just as I think the Member would find it difficult to predict what is going to happen in the world in 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister agree that if the money is invested somewhere else, or in other investment instruments, the investment would have a better yield? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> There is no such assurance. We could have lost it either or made more money. I cannot predict such suppositions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister agree that the level of risk tolerance for Government investment is much lower than private capital investment, as the Government's money is the people's money? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> That is true. This is what we do for the bulk of our investments, including Mount Charlotte. It could be argued that in the short-term it does not look as good as it ought to be.

Member refers to the \"Silicon Valley in Australia\". I am not aware of such a place. I am assuming he means the Silicon Valley of California, USA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Technologies Ventures (STV) is one of the five sector companies in Singapore Technologies Holdings (STH) and has invested a total of S$38 million in Silicon Valley companies. Net loss from those investments in 1991 amounted to S$5 million. Net loss in 1992 is expected to be less than S$0.5 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment in venture companies should be seen in a wider context and over a longer time frame. Not all investments will be profitable, nor always on a year by year basis. For example, total STV venture capital investments in the United States as well as other parts of the world are S$80 million at cost. For these investments, including those in Silicon Valley, while net loss in 1991 was S$7 million, for the period January to August 1992, there is a net realised gain of S$16 million. Additional net unrealised gain to date is more than S$50 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another STH sector company, Chartered Industries of Singapore (CIS) has invested S$280,000 in one company in Silicon Valley. This company has got into financial difficulties. CIS will be writing off this investment in its 1992 accounts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining three sector companies of STH have no investments in the Silicon Valley. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HDB RENTAL FLATS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Number of applications)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S.

This increase in demand for rental flats is largely due to a lowering of the minimum age limit for rental applicants. In 1989, the age limit for rental applicants who apply with a proper family nucleus was lowered from 29 years to 21 years of age. In 1990, the age limit for rental of HDB flats by single persons under the Joint Singles Scheme was also revised to 35 years for both male and female applicants. Prior to the revision, the age limit was set at 40 years for males and 35 years for female applicants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are about 4,900 applicants on the waiting list for HDB rental flats. About 1,400 flats are currently available for rental to citizen families. To meet the rise in demand for rental flats, HDB has increased the supply of rental flats. An additional 2,300 flats will be released for rental in the coming months. This will significantly reduce the waiting list for rental flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S.

In any case, the 20% downpayment for purchase flats is not a new requirement. The 20% downpayment has always been a requirement, even under the old waiting list system.

From January 1993, it will become mandatory under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act for all private hospitals to provide such information to their patients so that the patients could make an informed choice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry does not presently intend to control or regulate the practice of itemised charging by private hospitals. However, we will ask private hospitals to include in their schedule of daily ward charges an explanation on their charging practice and a price list of basic items of sundries and supplies. Patients will then know beforehand how much they will be charged for these items separately, and misunderstanding will be minimised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware that the public is concerned over the high level of charges by private hospitals. However, charges for sundries and supplies form only a small part of the total bill. The bigger components are charges for medical services by the hospital and the doctors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is currently looking into ways to contain healthcare costs not just in the public sector, but also in the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> private sector. Some countries, for example, Germany and Japan, control national healthcare costs by controlling private sector fees and charges. The United States has recently set limits on how much doctors and hospitals can charge patients on Medicare and Medicaid. We are studying their experiences. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister has said that the main fees chargeable go to the medical services of doctors. How are doctors' fees chargeable? Is it by time, or on what basis? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> We are talking about hospital bills here. The hospital bills include charges by doctors for the visits to the inpatients on ward rounds, as well as surgical fees, if there is an operation involved. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am just curious how the hospitals charge doctors' and surgeons' fees. Like other professions, there is time costing. They justify by saying so much time is spent on the work. How do hospitals charge surgeons' and doctors' fees? On what basis, please? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Mr Speaker, the question is about the charges for sundries and supplies, not about doctors' fees and charges. If the Member is interested in tabling that question another time, I would be pleased to answer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister aware of some of the kind of charges which are non-medical in nature? For example, I have documentary evidence of a bill in which a video tape of $8.40 has been charged for recording the surgical procedure. Will the regulations cover such items rather than give a broad category of items which will be charged medically? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned, the regulations will make it mandatory for private hospitals to state in advance the kind of charging practices they will carry out. That would presumably include that if they do have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> a video tape, they would have to inform the patient they are going to charge for it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CHILDCARE LEAVE FOR FEMALE EMPLOYEES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Introduction of legislation)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. \n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether he will consider introducing legislation to provide childcare leave for female employees to enable them to look after their sick children, similar to the leave presently in existence in the public sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while the civil service does grant full-pay unrecorded leave to a female employee to look after sick children below the age of six, Government does not intend to introduce legislation to compel all employers to offer similar benefits to their employees. Employees are already entitled to various leave benefits under the Employment Act. Some companies provide leave benefits beyond the minimum spelt out by the Act, such as compassionate leave. We should leave the private sector to work out suitable childcare leave scheme for each company. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in giving this sick child leave to women in the public sector, could the Hon. Minister consider extending it to men also for the following reasons: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There are some single parent families which consist of the father only who has to look after the sick child; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Some mothers may be away or who are sick themselves and thus the fathers would then have to play the role of looking after the sick child; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) When a child has both the father and mother, the duty and privilege of looking after the sick child should fall on both parents, and not just the mother alone. For what can enhance family \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> solidarity more than a concerned father taking leave to look after his sick child, and this will help to strengthen the family unit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the sentiments expressed by Dr Soin on the need to show compassion and concern for a father who wants to take leave from work to look after a sick child, in the case where the mother is unable to do so. I would ask the Minister for Finance, as the Public Service Department comes under his portfolio, to look into this suggestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CRUISE SHIPS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Measures to ensure safety)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Dr Wang Kai Yuen - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. To ask the Minister for Communications what measures are or will be taken to ensure the safety of cruise ships which pick up passengers from Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Yuhua):</b> Question No. 11, please. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, safety at sea is governed by the various Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Conventions. These Conventions prescribe the standards of safety for the construction, equipment and operation of ocean-going ships. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) also prescribes basic standards for the loading of ships as well as regulations for the prevention of collision at sea. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a party to all these Conventions. The various standards of safety are provided for in our Merchant Shipping Act. PSA is empowered to inspect and verify the validity of a passenger ship's statutory certificates required under the various Conventions before the ship leaves Singapore. The certificates include the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate as well as the Loadline Certificate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These certificates verify that the vessel is fit for service for which it is intended. They also ensure that the vessel is not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> overloaded. In the case of the \"Royal Pacific\", all the above procedures were adhered to. Notwithstanding these requirements, a carrier is also expected to exercise due care and diligence and to ensure that their staff and agents keep the ship seaworthy, properly manned and equipped at all times during the voyage to secure the safety of their passengers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is very concerned about the recent sinking of the \"Royal Pacific\". I have set up a Review Committee to look into the possibility of further improving the safety of passengers departing from Singapore. The Committee, chaired by the Marine Department, comprises representatives from the Port of Singapore Authority, National Maritime Board, Immigration Department as well as the various Ship Classification societies. It will examine, and, if necessary, recommend changes to the existing arrangements, procedures and legislation for ensuring the safety of cruise ships departing from Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson GRC):</b> Sir, I note from the recent press reports that the Malaysian authorities do not intend to conduct an inquiry into the mishap of the \"Royal Pacific\" and therefore may not come up with measures to ensure the safety of ships plying in the Straits of Malacca. May I ask the Minister whether he will consider approaching the Malaysian authorities again to review their decision? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the jurisdiction for investigation into the sinking of the \"Royal Pacific\" lies with three parties. First of all, the country in whose territorial waters the incident occurred. From all the evidence so far, the collision occurred in Malaysian waters. Secondly, the party or parties whose flag states are involved. In the case of the \"Royal Pacific\" it is flagged in Bahamas, so the Bahamian authorities would be involved. And in the case of the \"Terfu 51\", the Taiwanese authorities would be involved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Government has been in touch with all these three authorities to enquire whether they are going to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> conduct an investigation. We have been officially informed by the Bahamian authorities that they have appointed a local investigation authority to look into the sinking. So far, we have not heard officially from the Malaysians or from the Taiwanese. We will be in contact with these two governments to ascertain what is the current position. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lau Ping Sum -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lau Ping Sum (Ang Mo Kio GRC):</b> In view of the fact that a few Singaporeans are still missing, is the Minister aware of the actions being taken by the Malaysian Government in further trying to identify the whereabouts of these people? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the Malaysian search and rescue authorities, who are conducting the search, have informed us that they are currently continuing with the search. However, the extent of the search is obviously not as intense as it was in the early days after the sinking of the \"Royal Pacific\". The Marine Department of Singapore is in touch with the Malaysian authorities to persuade the Malaysian authorities to continue as far as possible with the search and rescue mission. However, it is quite possible that any such efforts will not lead to much further success. So the Malaysian authorities will probably have to call off their search pretty soon. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Singapore authorities are concerned, we have offered every possible assistance to the Malaysians. And I understand also that the relatives of some of the missing people have also engaged their own divers to conduct their own diving operations. However, I regret to say that so far none of these efforts have borne fruit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SINKING OF ROYAL PACIFIC</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Recognition to Singaporeans who displayed heroism)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Dr Wang Kai Yuen - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.

A number of persons have died. Others are still missing. Nevertheless, the fact that hundreds of survivors were rescued from a ship which sank in the middle of the night is something that we are thankful for. The survivors have reported various acts of courage that night. The suggestion by the Member for Bukit Timah can be considered, and I will ask my officers to follow up on his suggestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Limitation period for parking offence)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. \n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for National Development, in relation to a Housing and Development Board parking offence, whether there is a limitation period after which the HDB shall not proceed to take action against the offender or alleged offender, or are members of the public expected to keep all HDB used parking coupons and parking receipts for up to 5 years or more. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB car parks are regulated by the Parking Places Act, 1974. The Act does not prescribe any limitation period after which HDB shall not take action against those who commit parking offences. However, section 14 of the Act provides that a vehicle owner shall not be guilty of an alleged offence if he cannot with reasonable diligence ascertain the name and address of the actual offender. If HDB is slow to take action in a case, the alleged offender can claim protection under this section, and argue in court that he cannot with reasonable diligence ascertain the name and address of the actual offender, because of the long lapse of time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, however, HDB gives parking offenders early notice and ample opportunity to settle their cases. Besides the parking offence notice issued on the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> spot, the HDB sends a notice by registered post within a month of the offence. If there is no response, the offender is given a final notice followed by a court summons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offenders therefore receive up to four notifications, including two registered letters. A motorist who disputes the parking offence notice has ample opportunity to do so at an early stage. If he responds promptly either by appealing against or accepting HDB's offer of a composition fine, then the question of retaining used parking coupons and parking receipts for any extended period will not arise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a motorist chooses to contest the offence in court, then it is his responsibility to keep the parking coupons and parking receipts that he thinks will support his case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, let me inform the House that many motorists whose cases take years to settle have repeatedly flouted the law, and ignored the many notices and reminders. For example, one motorist accumulated 418 parking summonses, and five more received more than 200 summonses each, over periods of three to six years. They have tried to take advantage of the heavy workload in the Courts, and flagrantly ignored reminders, composition fines and court summonses. Now that HDB and the Courts are clearing cases more quickly, their offences have finally caught up with them. Such recalcitrant offenders should not be let off lightly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister's answer has not stated whether or not it will give up on summonses that are too long. I have personally known of cases where people who were in fact under a warrant of arrest had been brought to the police station to answer parking charges as early as 1984. So if there is no cut-off period -- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, could you ask your question? You are making a speech. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No. I am just asking the Minister --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Ask the question, please. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> --- whether there is a cut-off period for these early parking offences. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The answer is that there is no cut-off period legally or administratively. These people who are now being hauled up are the ones who have flagrantly ignored reminders. To let them off now, to give them an amnesty, is to punish those who have paid up their summonses and composition fines. Those who have delayed, hoping to get away with it, will now be dealt with appropriately. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is the Minister saying that everyone who parks his car from now on will have to retain his receipts and parking coupons all their lives? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> No! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Because there are cases which they have not received the HDB notices, for some reason or other. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I think Mr Chiam has not heard the answer. First of all, a motorist has a parking offence notice on his windscreen. If he has not received that, or he claims he has not received that, he has a registered letter informing him of his offence. He has another reminder, if he has not received the registered letter. Finally, he has a registered letter of a Court summons. Upon receipt, he can still settle his composition fine. So the administrative procedures taken give the offender plenty of notice to settle his case. If he ignores all these and wait for the case to be handled in Court, then he must keep his parking coupons to testify that he has not committed the offence. If he ignores this, then he must take the appropriate action himself to keep those parking coupons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by and large, Singaporeans who are law-abiding would have settled the offences and would have appealed if they think that they have not committed the offence. So such cases will not arise. Those cases which are heard in Court much later are those who flagrantly ignored these reminders. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is it not true that the Minister admits himself that there is not enough manpower to carry out all the procedures that he has mentioned? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> That is not true. We have sufficient manpower and we have the enforcement notices duly administered.

Dhanabalan, explained HDB's policy on the use of void deck space. As far as possible, void decks will be kept open so that residents can have space for social interaction as well as for other practical purposes. HDB will, however, allow a limited portion of the void deck space in each estate to be converted for use by organisations providing educational and social services needed either by the residents in the area or the community at large. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As HDB wants to minimize the conversion of void deck space, HDB has set strict criteria for its allocation. Void deck space for the setting up of education centres is allocated only to approved organisations which are registered under section 29(1) of the Companies Act, and which have a paid-up capital of $5 million or more. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly speaking, to be registered under section 29(1) of the Companies Act, an organisation must be set up for charitable or related objectives which are in the general or national public interest, have the financial means to carry out its objectives and be non-profit making. The paid-up capital requirement of $5 million is used by HDB as the criterion to judge whether or not an organisation registered under section 29(1) of the Companies Act has the financial means to provide on a continuing basis educational services of the required standards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a matter of judgement whether the paid-up capital requirement should be set at $5 million or some other figure. The Government is of the view that the paid-up capital requirement of $5 million is adequate but not excessive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organisations which are not registered under section 29(1) of the Companies Act or which do not satisfy the minimum paid-up capital can still provide educational services in HDB estates. They can rent or purchase commercial space at market rates. Planning approval will have to be sought for change of use of such premises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the specific question of the educational and community service facilities in Hougang Constituency. Hougang Constituency is a fairly mature estate with most of the flats built before 1989. In tandem with the development of the estate, a wide range of social and community-oriented facilities have been provided, not only within the constituency, but also in Hougang New Town as a whole, of which Hougang Constituency is but a part. In the constituency itself, there is a community centre, primary school and junior college. In Hougang New Town as a whole, there are nine primary schools, seven secondary schools, a polyclinic, a sports complex and a home for the aged. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, HDB has allocated void deck space in Hougang Constituency for various voluntary welfare and grassroots organisations whose activities are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> supported by the Ministry of Community Development or other competent authorities. These community-oriented facilities include two childcare centres, one Senior Citizens' Club, two education centres, one community hall, one police post and five Residents' Committee centres. There is, therefore, no lack of educational and community service facilities in Hougang Constituency. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is there a limit to the number of centres which a foundation can set up with the $5 million minimum paid-up capital requirement? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> There is no limit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I believe that the PAP Community Foundation, which sets up hundreds of education centres in Singapore, would need to spread the capital over all its education centres.

Unsightly litter can still be seen frequently polluting our canals and drains. The same ugly litter is also seen all over the housing estates, especially in the evenings and early mornings, before the army of cleaners \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> come to clear them away. The majority of us who do not litter have to bear with the unsightly litter thrown by the very small minority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to understand why there are those who persist in throwing litter out of their windows or out of their cars or when they are moving about in public places. They can very easily do the right thing. There are the refuse chutes in the homes for those who live in flats, the ash trays in cars for those who drive and smoke, and the thousands of litter bins placed all over Singapore for the pedestrians to use. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is our home and we must treat our 'home' with due respect and help keep it clean. If we can keep Singapore clean, we will not need so many workers to sweep up the mess. Public funds can then be better utilised elsewhere. Town Councils will also find that they do not need to spend so much on public cleansing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Littering is an anti-social act that can be stopped. All it takes is a bit of effort on the part of everyone. Over the years, the Government has mounted campaigns after campaigns to educate the public not to litter. It is noted also that the fines imposed have not been sufficient deterrent to make people take that extra bit of effort to put litter in its proper place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, therefore, has decided that those who persist in littering or who commit serious littering offences will be made to clean up litter found in public places. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of the Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill, 1992, recalcitrant littering offenders and those who commit serious littering offences which directly cause pollution or give rise to cleansing problems will be liable to be issued with a Corrective Work Order by the courts. Offenders issued with a Corrective Work Order will be asked to report to a designated public place and will be assigned areas to clean up under supervision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corrective Work Order will only be issued to offenders who are 16 years \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of age or above. The duration of work will not exceed three hours. If an offender fails to comply with any of the requirements of the Corrective Work Order, he may be summoned to appear before the court and the court may order him to pay a fine not exceeding $5,000 or may convict him to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School children who litter will be dealt with according to the current practice which is to report them to their parents and to their school principals. In addition, my Ministry is considering making errant students attend a counselling session which my Ministry will conduct. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, presented before Parliament, seeks to introduce a greater deterrent against those who litter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment Bill before us is historic, in the sense that, for the first time, we are instituting a law which may require an offender to perform corrective work as a form of punishment. Specifically, the proposed Act deals with offences relating to littering or dumping in a public place, and the corrective work involves the cleaning of any premises instructed by the supervision officer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans today do not litter because they feel that it is not right to do so. Thanks to our many anti-littering campaigns. However, the littering problem persists because there are still many who do so. This can easily be confirmed by having a look around the grounds following a fun fair, the state of our beaches after a week-end or public holiday, and the amount of cleaning work town councils have to perform. There is, in fact, no reason for anyone to litter because, as the Minister says, there are litter bins everywhere. Clearly, the current legislation of a stiff fine is not effective in deterring people from littering. Some may ask: \"Why don't we simply step up our enforcement action?\" But may I ask: how many more officers \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> should we employ to go about catching people littering? Is there not a better way to tackle the littering problem? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment Bill which we are now considering is such a way. It will not only be more effective as a deterrent to others and for the reformation of the offenders, it will also be more equitable on the basis of just desserts. The imposition of a fine in the current legislation hurts different people differently, depending on their affordability to pay, whereas compulsory corrective work is no respecter of persons. Whether an offender is rich or poor, in a high position or low, he will similarly be constrained to perform the corrective work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed law will also be more effective as a deterrent because to many, the performance of corrective work would bring about a great sense of shame, a loss of face, especially in an Asian society. For the same reason, there may also be considerable apprehensions about the possibility of one being convicted for a minor littering offence. In this regard, may I ask the Minister whether he would only consider prosecuting people who have committed serious littering offence? May I also ask the Minister how many people have been caught littering, say, over the last six months? How many of these cases can be considered as serious enough to justify prosecution and what are they? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill also because it reinforces the idea that it is a shame to throw litter about indiscriminately. It is therefore instructional. If people feel no shame in that, then something is certainly wrong. Society as a whole will suffer. The sense of shame rightfully then should lie with the offence, not with the punishment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also extremely important that we inculcate in our young that it is a shame to litter so that they will grow up feeling that dirtying our nation is a shameful, anti-social act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my last point. The Bill, as it stands, caters for those over 16 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> years of age. As mentioned by the Minister, for those offenders who are under 16 years and schooling, the Ministry usually refers them to the school authorities after counselling them. Thereafter, there is no follow-up action on the part of the Ministry to find out what corrective actions the school authorities have taken. May I suggest that the Ministry monitors what actions the schools are taking. It should perhaps work with the schools in providing guidelines on the appropriate corrective actions. We must make every effort to correct the bad habit of our young. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would also like to ask the Minister what he proposes to do with those offenders who are above 16 years but are still schooling. Will he send them to the school or to the court? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think any Singaporean who believes in good law and order and who values a clean, healthy and pleasant environment would disagree with the Government on the need for this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, Singaporeans do support and observe the campaigns to keep our environment clean and healthy, even after the campaigns have been long over. Nonetheless, some people may, from time to time, break the laws or rules for the protection of the environment and environmental public health. They may have done so out of sheer bad habit or laziness or even in a moment of inexcusable forgetfulness. Some may have done so deliberately out of spite. If there are such people, I think they are a very small minority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I agree that people who break the laws or rules for the protection of the environment and environmental public health must make up for their misconduct. Ordering the offenders to do corrective work seems to be a more constructive alternative to the usual sanction of fines and imprisonment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not think I am wrong in saying that the aim of the Bill is to reform rather than to punish the offenders. An order to do corrective work \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is intended, figuratively speaking, as a mere rap on the knuckles and not as a stroke of the rotan. In keeping with the tenor of the Bill, I hope an assurance can be given in respect of the Bill that an offender will not be publicly humiliated by being ordered to do corrective work publicly in the immediate vicinity of where he stays or works. Any such unnecessary embarrassment may breed resentment and defeat the aim of the Bill to reform the offenders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the proposed nature of corrective work is as indicated in the Explanatory Statement, I think the larger interests of the community will be better served by giving an offender an option to work out his sentence in the relative privacy of a selected charitable institution. By so doing, the Bill would kill four birds with one stone. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The offender would be spared any additional embarrassment by being enabled to do his corrective work away from public attention. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The offender would thereby be less resentful of the order to do corrective work and more likely to recognise and accept his obligation to protect the environment and the environmental public health. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The offender might consequently become more aware and more understanding of the needs of the residents in the charity homes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) It would definitely help to solve the problem of the shortage of voluntary helpers for charity homes, at least on a temporary, if not, permanent footing. \n  <br>1.45 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Thomson GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I view this Bill as an innovation in the manner in which we deal with those who commit the offence of littering. This approach is, to my mind, constructive in the sense that we seek to impart a moral education on the offenders, ie, that they should not litter. I hope the public will view this measure positively, so that we may all appreciate our responsibility in maintaining cleanliness. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, littering is a long-standing problem in our country. It has prevailed even today, despite so many cleanliness campaigns being conducted year after year. The message that we need to keep the country clean has also been spread to students in all schools. And while these efforts have borne tangible results, this anti-social disease is still evident in a small section of Singapore society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the introduction of the Corrective Work Order to be issued against offenders under this Bill. May I ask the Minister what sort of work would these offenders be required to perform. I hope the work to be done would not demean them so much so that society will look down upon them. Self-respect is very important to us Asians, Orientals. We want to preserve our family honour. The officers who supervise corrective work need to be sensitive so as not to hurt the feelings of the offenders. If our objective is to be constructive, those who perform corrective work must be treated with care. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister in what locations the offenders will be doing their work. May I, like my colleague from Aljunied GRC, suggest that offenders be required to perform cleaning work in the welfare homes run by certain social organisations. These homes do have a need for volunteers to carry out such work. The supervisors of these homes could also supervise them. In this way, at least the offenders would be doing something useful for society. I hope the Minister for the Environment would consider these suggestions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Mr Speaker, the idea behind this Bill is very clear, and I personally support it. I also support the views raised by fellow Members earlier. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to seek a clarification from the Minister. There are Singaporeans who work as cleaners and sweepers, and I think some of them also commit such an offence. To ask these \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> cleaners and sweepers to do cleaning and sweeping may not be a reformation or punishment because it is something they do almost daily. So for this category of people who commit this offence, maybe we have to look for another way to educate and train them to be more caring as far as taking care of the cleanliness of our nation is concerned. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ho Peng Kee (Sembawang GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Chen has mentioned, this Bill is a landmark Bill in that for the first time in Singapore there is introduced to the arsenal of possible sanctions open to the court, what is called in literature \"the community service order\". Here, it is in the context of littering. Perhaps, with this beginning, the possibility of introducing such an order for other offences may be considered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been talking to people. Looking at the problem of road bullies, is it a possibility that for road bullies, such an order be made available and road bullies be made to do short stints in hospitals so that they come in touch with the people they hurt? They will see at close quarters what sort of pain their actions, very often done in the heat of passion, can inflict. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, we heard two viewpoints. One viewpoint was the effect or benefit of such an order in terms of deterrence. I think from that point of view it makes sense for the recalcitrant litterer to pick up litter in public. There is nothing worse in the Asian context than to be seen doing this in public. On the other hand, as the term suggests, the Corrective Work Order, or the larger phrase, the community service order, is linked to doing service for the community. We look at not just wanting to punish him, but also to correct him. Therefore, I would urge the Minister, when carrying out such a new sanction, to put emphasis also on the role of counselling, to inform and counsel him so that this benefit of correcting the person is not just effected through actions, but reinforced through words, through \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pictures, through slides, as to why littering is terribly anti-social and incurs high social cost. I hope that this balance can be struck between the deterrent effect and the reformative effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, one suggestion is that, instead of emphasising one at the expense of the other, we could have a graduated scale, starting off maybe with doing community service in privacy first. If the person is still recalcitrant, then we move towards a position where we expose him and humiliate him in public. I will humbly suggest that we should not at the outset just expose him to public humiliation, but work towards a position where, if the person does not want to reform, then we expose him fully and make him lose face in public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while I agree that corrective measures are good, I tend to feel that we may demean the whole situation and get us back to those who have actually gone into voluntary service. Schools which have been organising students to clean the beaches and so on will take that they are all to be seen as offenders in future. I think the negative part will come in. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It brings me back to my school days when we were sent to detention classes and asked to pick up papers in the school compound. That means, when there is voluntary work in actually cleaning the school, people tend to keep away because they fear that they will be seen to be offenders. So I think we look at the whole \"fine\" situation that we are imposing and it does not go down to the people of Singapore in that our education system, our civic consciousness does not come through. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of this Bill, maybe we have to see to the part on implementation which Mr Chin mentioned: how do we get these people into voluntary services? How do we coerce them, how we counsel them, how to win them over? I think the point about just simply putting corrective measures and then later charging them in court is, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> again, a very heavy stick. I would like to propose that we look at some softener. People who are actually coming forward to help should not be seen to be offenders at the end of the day. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank hon. Members who have spoken on the Bill. I shall attempt to give replies to the points they have raised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have mentioned in my speech, the Corrective Work Order (CWO) is intended for recalcitrant littering offenders and also for those who commit serious littering offences. My Ministry will decide whether an offence is serious or not and refer those considered serious to the Court for hearing. If the court is satisfied that it is expedient that the offender should be made to clean up litter at a public place, with a view to his reformation or protecting the environment and the environmental public health, then the court shall issue a Work Order to the offender. Of course, in making the Corrective Work Order the court will take cognisance of the offender's physical and mental condition as well as his suitability for carrying out the Work Order. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious littering offence is one which will directly cause pollution or give rise to cleansing problems. Dropping or throwing out or leaving behind bags of refuse, styrofoam boxes, packets of food, old furniture, are some of the good examples I can think of. What the Environment Ministry may consider as minor littering offence would be littering with cigarette butts, or car park coupon tabs, and things like that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For minor offences, Sir, the offender will be offered a composition fine of $150. He is also expected to undergo a counselling session conducted by the Ministry. However, Sir, if an offender who has committed a minor littering offence is a recalcitrant offender, then I am afraid he will not be offered a composition fine. Instead, he will be asked to appear in Court and may be liable for a CWO. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr John Chen mentioned that the Bill is designed to shame the offender, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and he is right in that. Sir, the aim of the CWO is to reform or rehabilitate the offender so that, hopefully, he will not in future litter again, which otherwise would cause problems to the environment and environmental public health. The form of punishment prescribed in the Bill will serve as a deterrent against littering. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But really, Sir, the bottom line is that one can choose not to litter and this choice is not a difficult one to make. Therefore, anybody who chooses to litter must, at the same time, be prepared to face the consequences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go along with suggestions made by Mr Chin Harn Tong, Encik Ibrahim Othman and a few others, namely, that the offenders be made to carry out the CWO in charitable homes, away from the glare of publicity, then I am afraid the objective of the Bill will be lost. For it to be an effective deterrent, the CWO will have to require the offenders to clean and pick up litter in public places, such as beaches and parks. Of course, offenders on CWO will be supervised by public health inspectors of my Ministry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to students who litter, my Ministry will be drawing up some guidelines to assist principals. True, Sir, up to this point of time, school principals have not been given guidelines by the Ministry of the Environment to deal with such students. However, I have been made to understand that besides being counselled by the school principals, some of these students are also being made to pick up litter in the school compound. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chen also wants to know the number of people caught littering this year. Sir, there were about 2,000 littering offenders apprehended in the first seven months of this year. Of this number, Sir, 3% were repeat offenders and another 13% committed serious littering offences. Had the CWO been introduced at the beginning of this year, it would mean that about 16% of littering offenders apprehended in the first seven months of this year would be dealt with under the CWO scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mohamad Maidin has suggested that if offenders are cleaners themselves, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> they should be subjected to other forms of punishment, because cleaning is something which they do every day. I will ask my Ministry to look into the suggestion. Maybe they should be made to do something else other than cleaning. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Ho Peng Kee's suggestion that perhaps those who are carrying out the CWOs should be counselled at the same time, I certainly welcome that suggestion although at this point of time only those who commit minor littering offences and made to pay composition fines will be subjected to counselling. I certainly welcome his idea that even those who are carrying out the CWOs be also counselled by the Ministry. I will certainly take up his suggestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Ahmad Mattar]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SMALL CLAIMS TRIBUNALS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>2.03 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill amends the Small Claims Tribunals Act (Chapter 308). Sir, the Subordinate Courts Rules Committee, which is chaired by the Senior District Judge, was asked by the Chief Justice last year to review the Small Claims Tribunals Act and the Rules thereunder and to recommend any necessary changes which are necessary in the light of working experience gained. The amendments in this Bill are the result of the work of this Committee and have been recommended by the Chief Justice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the proposed amendments have become necessary as a result of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the change in the character and volume of claims which have come before the tribunals. Basically, these amendments have the following objectives: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to improve the statutory provisions regulating the manner in which the claims are dealt with; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to remove shortcomings in the Act which are the source of administrative strain on the limited resources of the tribunals; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, generally, to improve the efficacy of the tribunals as a machinery for the settlement of any dispute arising from a contract for the sale of goods or provision of services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may turn to the specific amendments, Sir. First, the Bill allows destruction of records of completed cases of a tribunal after a period of at least one year from the date of the tribunal's order or after the conclusion of an appeal to the High Court. The reason for this amendment is to alleviate the storage problem of such records posed in the light of the ever increasing number of cases. But the claim form and the order of the tribunal will be retained for a period of 12 years through administrative arrangement in the light of the Limitation Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second amendment, Sir, is to allow the Registrar at the consultation stage to do the following things: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to discontinue any claim outside the jurisdiction of the tribunals; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to dismiss any claim lodged if a claimant fails to appear; or \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to enter judgment in default of a respondent's appearance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for these amendments is that at present the definition of \"tribunal\" does not include the Registrar. As a result, at the consultation stage, the Registrar is unable to make a decision on straightforward matters, for example, dismissing a claim which is clearly outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal or to enter a default judgment when one party fails to appear. Instead, he has to fix the matter for a hearing before a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tribunal (presided by a referee who is usually a magistrate in the Subordinate Courts) to make such an order. This is quite unproductive and it delays the disposal of cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third amendment, Sir, is to allow a tribunal to set aside any order made by the Registrar. The reason for this amendment is that we want to provide a mechanism to check on the exercise of powers of the Registrar to ensure that there is no abuse of power or miscarriage of justice. The amendment will allow an aggrieved party to make the relevant application and provide a tribunal with powers to set aside the Registrar's order. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth amendment, Sir, is to enable Town Councils to be represented before a tribunal by its full-time employee or a full-time employee of its management agent. I think Members of this House who have to deal with Town Councils must be familiar with the reason. Because the Act at present does not allow for representation of parties by agents, this has caused considerable difficulties for Town Councils which often operate with skeletal staff and rely on managing agents to attend proceedings before a tribunal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth amendment, Sir, is to increase the time limit for the filing of application to set aside any order made in default of appearance from seven days to one month. The reason for this amendment is that it is necessary because the time required for the tribunal order to be prepared and despatched through the post takes more than seven days due to various administrative constraints. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments recommended by the Chief Justice upon the report of the Subordinate Courts Rules Committee, I believe, will certainly help to improve the functioning of these tribunals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendments which have been recommended by the Chief Justice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Small Claims Tribunal is a machinery which was set up to settle disputes arising from a contract for sale of goods or provision of services. The procedure is simple, informal, inexpensive and expeditious. Lawyers are precluded from representing and being party to the proceedings before a tribunal. The primary function of the tribunal is to attempt to bring the parties to a dispute to an agreed settlement. The prominence is given to the mediating function of the tribunal. I am glad that the amendments do not affect the simplicity of the proceedings or compromise the safeguards provided in the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In allowing the Registrar to decide in cases where a claim is outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal or when one party fails to appear, will, in fact, allow for the speedy disposal of cases before the tribunal and enable the tribunal to deal with its increasingly large volume of cases. However, this will not compromise the safeguards of the Act as the decision of the Registrar can be appealed against by the aggrieved party. The appeal will be heard by a referee (a magistrate in the Subordinate Courts). Prior to the amendment, the Registrar had no power to decide on such cases. The matter had to be referred to the referee, thus causing delay. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments also alleviate some of the problems faced by the Town Councils. Town Councils run on a tight budget and depend on managing agents to assist them. The amendment will enable the managing agents to represent Town Councils in proceedings before a tribunal. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I rise to speak in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, as the Minister has said, this Bill and the amendments thereof will certainly facilitate the small claims process in Singapore. As Dr Beng has mentioned, the key benefits of the process are simplicity, economy, and also the fact that consumers will feel comfortable with the process since no lawyers are present and the costs are low. And that is why, Sir, it is for very \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> very reason that even though I support the Bill, I think some concern should be registered in that, like the other small claims processes in the world, the small claims process in Singapore has mainly benefited not so much the consumers but companies, government agencies, statutory boards who have got many claims of a simple nature to press. And, therefore, I find that with the present amendment, the Town Councils will find it easier to file claims in court. However, it also adds on to this problem: that where consumers, even though they were to be important beneficiaries of the small claims process, will find themselves now being put before the Small Claims Tribunal by an additional agency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not something peculiar to Singapore. It is a problem that all small claims processes grapple with, and other jurisdictions have tinkered with various ways to control the problem but without much success. For example, you can think of limiting the status of claimants, although I think this is too extreme, or you can limit each claimant to a certain number of claims that can be filed within a time period of a month or so, although that may be said to be denying justice to a legitimate party, the corporate party. Or you could actually make corporate parties or any other parties for that matter who file beyond a certain number of claims within a certain period of time to pay more. This will not deter them as such, but this will reflect the fact that they use the facilities more and, therefore, they should bear in greater proportion the costs of these facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other quick points I wish to make. The Minister in his Second Reading speech of the Small Claims Tribunals Bill in 1984 did say that after the system had been tried out and found to be successful, consideration may be given to extending the jurisdiction of the tribunal to cover other types of actions. I note that this point has not been considered in these present amendments. But I would like to ask the Minister whether, after eight years of its \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> successful implementation, he would consider extending the jurisdiction of small claims tribunals. Again, there are two ways to do it. You can extend it by way of lifting or raising the quantum of monetary limit (right now it is $2,000) or you could extend the types of claims that can be brought before the court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, I think we can take a leaf from other jurisdictions. I believe in New Zealand, for example, other claims, besides contracts for sale of goods or provision of services, can be brought before the tribunal. I do know that an important point of this tribunal is that you do not want to put before the tribunal complex issues of law. Therefore, the supposition is that in a contract for sale of goods under $2,000, or provision of services under $2,000, this problem would not arise. Given this constraint, would the Minister therefore consider other situations, such as is available in New Zealand, property damage to vehicles in accident cases which do not involve injury to persons or complex issues of law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other quick point is, as Dr Beng has mentioned, one of the key benefits of the Bill is that there is no legal representation. We know sometimes when lawyers get into the picture, there is a possibility that simplicity may be lost or economy or speed may be lost. However, I would ask the Minister whether he would consider, not legal representation, but lay representation, and not as of right but as a matter of discretion by the Registrar. For example, if a 60-year old lady enters into a contract for the sale of a fridge - she is the party to the contract - and the fridge proves to be defective, then under section 21 of the Act she herself has to press the claim in a Small Claims Tribunal. Only when the party is a corporate party then you can have a representation. But in a case like this, which I would submit is an appropriate case, would not it be fairer if such an old lady can ask somebody else, eg, a younger nephew, to bring her case before the tribunal? I do not think this is opening the floodgates, but this is giving a proper discretion to the Registrar of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the tribunal to ensure that there is some parity between the parties in the contest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the two Members who have spoken on the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ho Peng Kee has raised some points. He has quite correctly observed that, over the years, the Small Claims Tribunal is now being increasingly used by corporate bodies as distinguished from individuals. But if that has been so because of the trend, I would like to emphasise that it is not because individuals are prevented from access to the tribunals. There could be many reasons why individual consumers who have complaints have not resorted to the Small Claims Tribunals in large numbers. But whatever the reasons, I would like to assure him that the Small Claims Tribunal is still open to individual claimants who have complaints or claims which come within the province of the Small Claims Tribunal. Of course, there can always be a debate on any Small Claims Tribunal's structure as to whether it should be limited only to individuals. We debated this when the tribunal was established in 1984 and I did inform the House then that we considered the different options but decided that it is not a tribunal only for individual consumers but it is a tribunal for small claims, whether from shops or consumers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Ho Peng Kee asked whether, in the light of the experience gained, we are prepared to extend the jurisdiction. I would proceed very cautiously at this stage because what has happened in the past eight years is that the volume of work faced by the tribunals has shot up tremendously. And this problem was alluded to by the Chief Justice in his speech at the opening of the Legal Year where he commented on the usage of the tribunals by bodies like the Telecom, PUB, Town Councils, and so on. And consultations are going to be held with some of these bodies to work out the procedures where the pressure on the tribunals could be reduced. I understand from the Registrar of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Subordinate Courts that these consultations are well in hand. I would like to know, as Minister, first, how the Registrar of the Subordinate Courts and the persons in-charge of this tribunal see the future years of operation of Small Claims Tribunals. If they feel that the matters are under control, I think we can then consider some of the points raised by Mr Ho Peng Kee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His final point was, although he agrees with the need to have proceedings where individuals appear in person and not represented by lawyers, whether we could have lay representation. He cited, particularly, the situation of this old lady who might have a claim but who might not be able to sufficiently articulate before the tribunal. I would consider this point, Sir, in any future amendments to the Small Claims Tribunals Act. We may not want to have representation by agents or lay representation for each and every case. But in a difficult situation which he gave as a hypothetical example, perhaps, there may be good grounds for conferring some discretion with the Registrar to allow representation by either relatives or some immediate members of the family in this kind of situation, and I am prepared to consider that for the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. S. Jayakumar]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax (Amendment No. 2) Bill, 1992, gives legislative effect to income tax changes announced in the 1992 Budget Statement and 12 other changes not announced in that Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the tax incentives I have announced was to promote the establishment of the RAS Commodity Exchange Limited which will provide a centralised and regulated marketplace for trading of commodity futures. With effect from Year of Assessment 1993, the Exchange will be exempted from tax on its income from futures activities for a period of five years. In addition, the qualifying income derived by participants of the Exchange will be taxed at a concessionary rate of 10%. These incentives are similar to those granted to SIMEX. Clauses 2 and 15 amend section 13 and insert a new section 43K to provide for this incentive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To foster the development of sophisticated high value-added financial activities, I have also announced that with effect from Year of Assessment 1993, financial institutions will be allowed double tax deduction for expenses relating to the establishment and development of approved financial activities in Singapore. Clause 8 inserts a new section 14J to provide for this tax concession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, life insurance companies are taxed on the excess of investment income over management expenses and agency commissions. Where a life insurance company also carries on business outside Singapore, the income on which tax is payable is its world-wide investment income apportioned in the ratio of Singapore premiums over world-wide premiums. This basis of taxation is not satisfactory. It does not fully reflect the profitability of the insurance company, nor does it make a distinction between the income of the company that accrues to its policyholders as against shareholders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have thus announced that with effect from Year of Assessment 1993, life insurance companies will be taxed on their total income derived out of the Singapore business. This means that the assessable income of life insurance companies will include premiums in addition to investment income arising \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> from the Singapore business. At the same time, the expenses that can be deducted will now include benefit payments and increases in actuarial liability to policyholders. The resultant chargeable income attributable to policyholders will then be taxed at 10% whilst the portion attributable to shareholders will be taxed at the prevailing corporate rate. Clause 9 amends section 26 to provide for this change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in recognition of the contributions of reservists to Total Defence, I have announced that with effect from the Year of Assessment 1993, tax reliefs for reservists will be given in two tiers: $1,000 for active reservists and $500 for those who have done national service but are not in active reserve service. Clause 11 amends section 39 to effect this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reward effort and enterprise, I have also granted a 5% one-off and across-the-board rebate on personal income tax payable for the Year of Assessment 1992. Clause 20 provides for this rebate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporate tax rate will also be reduced from 31% to 30% with effect from the Year of Assessment 1993 to help maintain Singapore as an attractive location for investments and to offset some of the business cost increases of the past year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the reduced rate will apply to non-residents, trustees and executors as well as tax withheld at source on payments to non-residents. Clauses 13 and 17 amend sections 43 and 45 for this purpose. There are also two other amendments resulting from the deduction in corporate tax rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first relates to an adjustment to the dividend franking credit mechanism. Although the reduction in corporate tax rate takes effect from the Year of Assessment 1993, that is, 1st January 1992, companies could only be informed of this after our Budget announcement. Adjustment is, therefore, necessary for those dividends declared in the early part of 1992 of which tax has been withheld at 31%. A transitional adjustment is also \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> needed to avoid the mismatch whereby dividends derived before 1st January 1992 is taxed at 31% while a credit of only 30% is allowed on such dividend if the recipient company is assessed on such dividends in the Year of Assessment 1993. Clauses 10, 16 and 18 amend sections 35(2A), 44 and 46 to provide for these changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment relates to the tax rates in Part B of the Second Schedule of the Income Tax Act. With the lowering of the corporate tax rate to 30%, the highest effective tax rate imposed under Part B of the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act will be limited to 30%. This will ensure that those who are taxed under the existing Part B marginal rates, such as management corporations and clubs, will, in effect, not be taxed above the corporate rate of 30%. Clause 12 amends section 42(5) for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the remaining tax changes not announced in the 1992 Budget Statement. Two of them are necessary to fine-tune the existing provisions in our tax legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concerns sections 14(b), (c) and (d) of the Income Tax Act which allow a further deduction for expenses incurred in export promotion of Singapore-made goods by manufacturers and traders; and approved research and development projects in selected knowledge-based industries. At present, the portion of the income that is granted further deduction is not deemed as exempt income for purpose of declaring tax-free dividends. Clause 7 amends these sections of the Act to allow companies granted this incentive as well as the newly announced tax incentive for skill and knowledge-intensive financial activities to pass on the benefits of further tax deduction to their shareholders without incurring further tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment relates to the penalty for repeat offenders. Section 94(2A) currently provides for a further penalty against the taxpayer who has been convicted more than once for the same Year of Assessment for failing to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> comply with specific sections of the Income Tax Act. However, the existing provisions do not spell out the circumstances under which non-compliance is deemed to be a subsequent offence. Consequently, section 94(2A) cannot be invoked. Clauses 16 and 19 will amend section 94(2A) and provide for new sections 44(8A) and 94(2B) to rectify the anomaly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the amendments are consequential in nature. Clause 11 amends section 39 to allow tax deduction for compulsory contribution to Medisave by the self-employed with effect from Year of Assessment 1993. Following the increase in the employer's CPF contribution rate from 17 1/2% to 18%, clause 6 amends section 14(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act to allow, up to the limit of 18%, the deductions in respect of an employer's contribution to an approved pension or provident fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining consequential amendments, namely, clauses 3, 4, 5 and 13, result from the tax incentive for approved international shipping enterprises, the commodity futures market, the change in tax basis for life insurance companies as well as the tax exemption on dividends paid out of foreign income. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>DRUG TRAFFICKING (CONFISCATION OF BENEFITS) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Third time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill had its Second Reading in this House on 20th March 1992. At that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> time, I had explained at length the objectives of the Bill, the effect of its various provisions and, in particular, I explained the safeguards contained in the Bill. I said that we were especially concerned that the Bill should not undermine the confidence of depositors, investors and property owners over the confidentiality of records of their assets. Therefore, I do not propose to go over the same grounds again today. I will confine myself to mentioning the amendments to the Bill made in the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee received only two representations. 0ne representation was from the Association of Banks in Singapore through the MAS and the other representation was from the Singapore National Front. I think it is a fair inference from this that the Bill is generally acceptable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has made two amendments. First, on investigation powers. The Bill is quite a complicated and technical Bill. It is also not easy to uncover money laundering offences because the culprits use rather sophisticated techniques to avoid leaving a financial trail. Considerable expertise and skill is therefore required for these investigations, especially when the assets move quickly across borders and from one offender to another. Therefore, it is my view that we must utilise all available skilled and experienced investigators and resources, whether they reside in the CNB, the Police or other enforcement agencies. In particular, we would like to tap the experience of the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officers, especially since they have considerable experience in handling complex financial investigations involving financial institutions. CAD officers, at the moment, already have police investigation powers conferred on them in relation to offences under the Companies Act and the Securities Industry Act. However, to achieve our purpose, the amendment to clause 51 will give us the flexibility to appoint CAD officers, who are not police \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> officers, to assist CNB in the effective implementation of the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment, Sir, as a result of the ABS representation is a minor one. It allows banks to keep copies of their financial transaction documents instead of originals. With the advent of microfilm technology, this is a measure that will make storage of records more convenient for the banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may recapitulate, Sir, the aim of this Bill is to deny drug traffickers the enjoyment of the benefits of their crime by confiscating their assets which are derived from drug trafficking. As I have said before, the provisions of this Bill are based largely on the United Kingdom Drug Trafficking Offences Act but with modifications to suit our circumstances. Members will also recall that our Corruption (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, 1989, was also modelled on this United Kingdom precedent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains provisions which will enable the tracing, freezing and confiscation of assets obtained from drug trafficking activities. There will be sufficient investigative powers like production orders, restraint and charging orders given to the enforcement officers. But at the same time, there are adequate safeguards in the Bill to ensure the confidentiality of asset information, to ensure that there will be no fishing expeditions and that the Bill will only be directed against drug assets. Third party interests in assets will also be protected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me say that this Bill, as amended, provides us with an additional weapon to deter drug traffickers. Money laundering has also been made an offence to deter those who make it a point of not coming into physical contact with the drugs and benefits so derived will also be confiscated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has put in much time and effort to study the experience of other countries before coming up with this Bill. This Bill will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> indeed give our enforcement agencies yet another means to deter and curb the activities of drug traffickers. Indeed, it is a major milestone in our anti-drug enforcement programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two questions for the Minister. First, with the CAD now also being tasked to handle cases of drug money laundering, will there still be a financial investigation unit in the CNB? What are the implications of CAD's involvement on CNB's resources? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the CNB will have adequate manpower for this new function. Indeed, it is my hope that the involvement of CAD officials will be an interim measure whilst CNB officers gain expertise and exposure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is important for such investigations to be conducted in such manner that not only will the culprits not enjoy their ill-gotten gains but also the confidentiality of the financial accounts of innocent parties is safeguarded. I would like to ask the Minister whether the officers of CNB and CAD have had adequate training and exposure compared to the experience of their overseas counterparts to enable them to be effective in their investigation work under the new Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank Dr Arthur Beng. On his first question whether there will still be a financial investigation unit in the CNB, as I have mentioned, the CAD will be involved in handling cases of drug money laundering involving financial institutions. But the CNB will still have a role in investigating cases not involving money laundering, eg, they will have to be involved in tracing of assets of drug traffickers. And under the law, it is still necessary for the CNB to trace and freeze assets. Therefore, I still see there is a need for CNB to have a special unit set up within its organisation to conduct such investigations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, there will be additional manpower deployed for this purpose and I can assure him that my Ministry will take up with the other Ministries involved the question of ensuring that there is enough manpower. Initially, of course, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the unit, I expect, will be a small one. Depending on the workload envisaged, my Ministry will review the manpower needs as we go along. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards training, yes, this is an area where specialised training is necessary. Even before the Bill has received its final approval, CNB officers have undergone relevant training in financial investigations and other related matters, both in Singapore as well as in workshops, seminars and training courses held outside Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

First, it seeks to make provision for the computerised depository system for scripless transfer of securities listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES). Secondly, it provides a new regime that will enable representative or derivative actions to be brought on behalf of a corporation to enforce the rights of a corporation where the directors, for example, refuse to enforce those rights. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these major amendments, the Bill contains amendments that are designed to provide for the winding up of local companies and striking off the register of foreign companies which have been convicted of an offence under the Charities Act or the Regulations made thereunder. The Bill also makes provision \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for retrenchment benefits or contractual ex-gratia payments to be payable to employees on the winding up of a company. The remaining amendments are basically to remove anomalies in the Act and to improve its administration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now deal first with that part of the Bill that is concerned with the electronic transfer of securities listed on the SES. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Company law had for long required that every transfer of shares should be evidenced by a share certificate and the delivery of a completed transfer form to the company so that it could enter the name of the transferee in the company register and transfer the legal title to the shares to the transferee. Besides the great deal of paperwork involved, there is considerable delay between the time shares are sent for registration in the buyer's name and the time the shares are returned to the buyer. In the meantime, until he receives the physical share certificates from the company register, the buyer is denied the opportunity of re-selling the shares in the market at the opportune time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome these problems, the Central Depository System was introduced. Transfer of listed securities by reproduction of share certificates and transfer forms under the paper-based settlement system will be replaced by book-entries in the computer-based records controlled by an operator called the Central Depository Pte Ltd, or simply known as the Depository. Such a major conversion exercise, involving hundreds of listed companies and thousands of shareholders, obviously cannot be accomplished overnight. Until this exercise is completed, the paper-based system of transfer for listed securities will continue to function in parallel with the book-entry settlement system on the stock exchange. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the trading in shares on the stock exchange by investors is concerned, this will continue in much the same way as under the paper-based system. Shares will still be bought and sold through brokers. Investors whose \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> names are entered in the Depository Register shall be deemed to be members and consequently retain all the existing rights that go with such membership. For example, rights to dividends and voting rights. The main changes will occur, as I have mentioned, in the procedures of transfer of ownership of the shares. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Depository System, as it is called, that is introduced in the new Division 7A of the Bill, gives statutory support to the book-entry system introduced by the SES. This new system will avoid the inconvenience, waste and inefficiency associated with the paper-based system. Apart from these advantages, it provides greater security for investors and minimises the opportunities for fraud and forgery as well as losses from misplaced certificates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the system is that all owners of securities of companies that are listed on the SES will deposit the certificates relating to these securities with the Depository, and register them in the name of the Depository or its nominee. Shareholders of these listed companies may, however, at any time, withdraw these certificates and register them in their own names, if they, for whatever reason, choose to do so. But they will not then be allowed to trade in such shares on the SES unless the shares are brought back under the Central Depository System. The true ownership of the securities will be evidenced in accounts kept by the Depository in the name of each depositor. When the latter wishes to buy or sell securities, he gives instructions to the Depository or his depository agent which will effect the transaction by entering it in the Depository Register. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Division 7A seeks to ensure that the book entry system has the backing of statutory law and that proper safeguards are written into the law so that shareholders' rights and liabilities under the Act are preserved. Special provision is made for the mortgaging of book-entry securities. It clarifies doubts as to whether the scripless securities can be mortgaged and how this can be done. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Powers are also conferred upon the Minister to make regulations in respect of the depository system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now refer to the next major amendment. Clause 22 would make statutory provision for representative or derivative actions to be brought by shareholders on behalf of their corporations. Such actions would be brought, for example, where the directors of a corporation refuse to enforce rights belonging to the company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause would provide more effective remedies for minority shareholders than existed at common law at present. It would have the effect of overriding the obstacles put in the way of such actions by the common law. To ensure that the remedies that would be open to shareholders are not abused and give rise to unjustified court actions, section 216A contains strict conditions that must be satisfied before any action can be brought against corporations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go through the other amendments in the Bill. Clause 8 of the Bill seeks to enable the Minister to petition the Courts to wind up a local company, and the Registrar to strike off a foreign company from the register, if the local company or foreign company has been convicted of an offence under the Charities Act or the regulations made thereunder. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 amends section 328. The amendments have become necessary because of the High Court ruling in 1989 that retrenchment benefit is not payable when a company is in liquidation. To provide adequate protection for workers made redundant as a result of their companies being placed under liquidation, this section of the Companies Act will be amended as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to specifically stipulate that retrenchment benefits will be payable to employees affected by the winding-up of a company. In the event that the quantum of retrenchment benefits is not spelt out in the contract of service or collective agreement, the amount of compensation will be decided by the Commissioner of Labour; \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to allow claims for retrenchment benefits or contractual ex-gratia payments, to be payable to employees who have less than three years' service and who do not qualify for retrenchment benefits, to be accorded priority ranking after the \"costs of winding up\" and \"wages and salaries\"; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to subject the total claim for retrenchment benefits, contractual ex-gratia payment as well as \"wages and salaries\" as priority treatment to the ceiling of $7,500 or five months' salary, whichever is lower. Claims exceeding this ceiling shall be rated pari passu with other unsecured debts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to section 209A and the Ninth Schedule are, by and large, of a drafting nature to remove uncertainty in existing law relating to the consolidation of accounts and accounts generally of a company which practising accountants have come across in the course of their practices. The remaining amendments in the Bill are, in the main, designed to improve administration of the Act as well as to remove existing anomalies in it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Finance and Trade and Industry welcomes the amendments proposed in this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we feel that as the world economy matures, and hence keener competition within and outside Singapore, rules will have to be revised to keep abreast with changes. We therefore support the amendments. We also feel that since the amendments, particularly those relating to the Central Depository System, are quite technical and complex in nature and have an impact on a large section of the business community and the public at large, we recommend that this Bill be referred to a Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have some comments on other clauses of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Clause 4 (section 12)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this clause states that government companies that are classified as \"exempt private companies\" shall not disclose to the public any document or information relating to their activities in the \"interest\" of the public. The amendment could be perceived in the eyes of the prying public, few as they may be, as imposing a shroud of secrecy on what ostensibly is just another \"exempt private company\", except that it is now owned by the Government. It is therefore opportune perhaps for the Minister to explain and to illustrate with examples the possible \"public interest\" factors that would make disclosure of these companies undesirable. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Clause 6 (section 16A)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this clause confers immunity on the employees of the Registry of Companies (ROC) for information supplied to the public. To err is human, to forgive divine. It is quite another thing to guarantee in writing that when one acts in good faith, one need not fear punishment if one makes a mistake. Sir, the ROC supplies very important information to the public, indeed, and these are information which is more often than not piously relied upon. While I support this amendment, I wish to ask the Minister what measures are there in place to ensure that ROC staff act in good faith. Will the Minister assure the House that ROC staff will continue to be alert in their work and that ROC records and standards will not be compromised with the passing of this amendment? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Clause 18 (section 154)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this clause confers a discretion upon the Court as to whether a person will be disqualified to act as director on conviction of offences in Singapore. I would like to ask the Minister to explain if this also applies to offences committed outside Singapore, say, in Malaysia. If not, why not? Surely the standard of fraud outside of Singapore cannot be any less reprehensible. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Clause 22 (sections 216A and 216B)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Government is to be lauded for seeking to rest in the shareholder the right to vindicate the company. As in now, if the Board of Directors and/or the majority shareholder refused to act for the company, there is nothing that the individual minority shareholder can do. Lest the jubilation of giving this right of the shareholder to sue the company be carried to one extreme too far, the legislation must be guarded against encouraging frivolous and petty applications by minority shareholders to put unnecessary pressure on the Board of Directors in the process. Will the Minister therefore assure this House that the amendments, as contained in this Bill, are adequate to ensure that this will not happen? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Clause 23 (section 328)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the passing of this amendment will ensure that all employees will be guaranteed payment of retrenchment benefits ahead of unsecured creditors. Sir, many a time, when a company goes bust, the employees are left high and dry with little more than the wages payable under the existing law in the Act. This amendment will therefore be a boon and indeed a timely one in the light of an economy which is maturing. I just have one comment. I wonder if the total amount of retrenchment benefits payable to an employee should be pegged at $7,500 as the maximum. It seems fair to fix the amount at five months' salary, but does not seem quite fair to try to limit the amount to $7,500. It seems to penalise the better-paid employees. Therefore, will the Minister explain why is the maximum set at $7,500 and no higher? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the GPC has also approached the Resource Panel for comments on the Bill. We have conveyed the comments by the Resource Panel directly to the Minister and the Minister has given the assurance that he will look into the comments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to state that the proposed amendments to the Companies Act are mostly much welcome, as they seek to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> define better several anomalies that are present in the existing provisions. Most of the proposed amendments to the various sections, including the elaborate amendments to the Central Depository System, are most appropriate. I wish to voice my in-principle support for these amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thought I would like to use this opportunity to seek some clarification from the Minister on certain clauses of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Clause 16 (section 130)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the many additions to the Bill to specify the functions of the Central Depository. I believe that it is not clearly spelt out whose responsibility would it be to determine and verify whether a shareholder is local or foreign. At present, many companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore have to conform to certain limitations on percentage of foreign ownership. Therefore, it would probably be the responsibility of the company concerned to monitor closely whether these limits on the foreign ownership have been breached. It is not well defined as to whose responsibility, however, to verify the local or foreign status of shareholders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that section 130E states that, \"The Depository shall be under a duty to certify the names [but not status] of persons on the Depository Register\". However, it is only performing a registry or recording function to certify the names. I presume the company itself would be responsible for the policing work to watch over the foreign shareholders limit. If this is the case, would the company then have the power to instruct the Depository not to accept any additional registration of foreign shareholders should the foreign limit be reached? What would be the case if the Depository has made a recording error? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the new section 130H states that: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Subject to the regulations, the Depository, if acting in good faith, shall not be liable for conversion or for any breach of trust or duty where the Depository has, in respect of book-entries in accounts maintained by it, ... .\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> The ambiguity here, Sir, is that should a staff in the Depository make an error in book-entry, but having done it in good faith, this could result in either losses or damages incurred by the rightful owner, or the company having breached the foreign control limit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of the above circumstances, it is uncertain as to where the responsibility should lie, and where appropriate, from whom can redress or compensation be sought by the affected party. If the Depository is not at fault, since the staff has acted in good faith, and, on the other hand, as the company does not maintain the registry of shareholders and therefore could not be deemed to be responsible, we have a case of having to point fingers in circles, as no one would be prepared to take the responsibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Clause 22 (section 216)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Minister has introduced a new provision to allow a complainant, who could be a member of the company, to take action against the directors in the name of the company should there be a breach of right or duty owed to the company, with legal fees to be borne by the company. I am generally supportive of this intention in this Bill as it allows an aggrieved shareholder to take action against directors who have acted not in the interest of the company; and by association, not in the interest of the shareholders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am concerned with this new provision. It may provide and give rise to too liberal litigious tendency as any complainant, even those who are owning one share, could raise a personal vendetta against the directors of a particular company. This complainant, though purporting to be acting in the interest of the company, could have many personal, competitive or other reasons for taking actions against the directors and apply to Court to use the company's funds for the purpose. These Court actions could soak up much time and attention of the directors away from the proper running of the company. This would result in overall adverse effect on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the performance of the company and therefore definitely will not be in the interest of the company and all the other shareholders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, Sir, directors who have acted and managed the companies with their utmost ability and in the best interest of the company need not fear. However, I do feel that there is a need for a balance between allowing shareholders to take pot-shots at directors (using the company's funds as ammunition) and for shareholders to take errant directors to task. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that there is a provision in section 216A(3) which provides that any action may be brought against a director unless the Court is satisfied that the complainant is acting in good faith and it appears to be prima facie in the interest of the company. In order not to appear to be acting in oppression of the interest of minority shareholders, the Court may take a more liberal interpretation of this section 216A to permit action to proceed and allow the use of company funds to cover legal expenses. I would suggest to the Minister to consider whether the complainant should be required to produce a petition with more than, say, 20 signatories of bona fide shareholders or representation of at least, say, 5% shareholdings, before such action which invokes section 216 could be considered in Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Clause 23 (section 328)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek a clarification from the Minister on the intent of this section 328 which provides that in the situation of winding-up of a company, the amount payable to employees should not exceed the amount equivalent to five months' salary or $7,500, whichever is lesser. I agree with Mr Chew that I also find this proposed limit of $7,500 to be very disadvantageous to those employees who earn more than $1,500 a month. As we all know, nowadays several employees can easily earn more than $1,500 a month, particularly those \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> who have been working for many years and those who have families to support. Even a graduate engineer could command that amount as starting salary. I would like to ask the Minister to consider lifting this limit of $7,500, but retain the proposed limit of five months' salary of the employees affected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Companies Act has grown in volume and details over the years. Now, it is a book covering over 550 pages, not including the new amendments that are being proposed in this Bill. Perhaps it is why we need so many lawyers nowadays to understand these provisions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as this Bill is of importance to the operation of companies in Singapore, again I agree with Mr Chew, I would like to ask the Minister to refer the proposed Bill to a Select Committee to allow for wider views and representations to be obtained from professional bodies and the public. \n  <br>3.30 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to declare my pecuniary interest as a director of a public company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the general provisions in the Companies (Amendment) Bill but I would also like to support the views of the GPC for Finance and Trade and Industry that this Bill be committed to a Select Committee for the various points which were raised and some other points which I shall be bringing up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 18 revamps the existing section 154 which disqualifies a person from acting as a director or manager of a company. The present section 154 is a very blunt instrument which makes no distinction between executive and non-executive directors. Although the new section 154 makes no such distinction, the present new section 154 gives the Court the discretion. Therefore, in that case, I believe the Courts, in time to come, will make some distinction between the directors who are working and are responsible, and those directors who are not doing a job which is executive in nature. This should go some way towards addressing the concerns of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> directors who are now appointed to several boards of companies, especially those who are serving in the Audit Committees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section, however, restricts the disqualification only for offences committed under Singapore law whereas the existing provision of section 154 actually disqualifies a person when he is convicted of a law outside Singapore. The advantage of the new section 154 is that by excluding offences outside Singapore, it is much easier for Singapore businessmen and Singaporeans to invest and work outside Singapore, especially in countries where the judicial system is quite different from ours. But, however, by excluding foreign offences, I also share the views of Mr Chew that there does not seem to be any provision in the Companies Act which allows the Minister now to disbar or disqualify someone from acting as a director in case of an offence committed under a judicial system which is very similar to ours, for example, an offence under Malaysian law. I wonder what will the Minister do in the event that he needs to disqualify such a person from acting as a director, as asked by Mr Chew. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move to clause 16 on the setting up of the Central Depository Pte Ltd, or very commonly known as the CDP. A number of points have already been raised by Mr Chew and Mr Leong and I shall like to focus only on the part of the Bill relating to section 130J. Section 130J prohibits a shareholder or depositor from applying to a Court to rectify the register of the CDP. In other words, if a shareholder or a depositor's name has been removed by fraud or computer error, a person has got no recourse to law to have his name reinstated. Without his knowledge, in other words, a person or shareholder of a company may wake up one morning to find that he is no longer a shareholder until three months later when he receives a statement of account from the CDP. His only recourse is through the Court and his only remedy is damages and not reinstatement as a shareholder. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this raises several issues. One is that in the case of damages, there is no provision in the Bill at the moment which makes it mandatory for the CDP to take up adequate and sufficient insurance in the event of a loss in the Court. On one extreme, small shareholders will be penalised because it is very expensive and time-consuming to seek legal redress. It also raises the question of how would damages be determined. Share prices are very volatile and why should shareholders be penalised and be awarded damages at the time when the shares are removed from his ownership. He could have wanted to keep his shares for the long term. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other extreme, for the large investors, especially majority shareholders, they can also have a serious problem. The majority shareholders, by virtue of the fact that they control the majority of the shares in a company, have the right to control and manage the company. A sudden loss of a shareholding of some or all of the shares due to an error in the computer can mean that the majority shareholders lose control completely overnight. And taking a hypothetical example, this can happen even to Temasek which may not be a major shareholder of Singapore Airlines through such an error. What is the recourse for Temasek? They go to Court but the name cannot be reinstated. They are only entitled to damages from the CDP. It raises a lot of other interesting questions, especially if it relates to a controlling shareholder. If such a shareholder loses his shareholding or part of it, and he reinstates his shares by buying in the market which breaches the take-over code, is he obliged to make a mandatory general offer again for the rest of the shares? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 22 on the derivative actions provides an effective remedy to minority shareholders. I welcome this clause. I think it is very useful and very important, especially for closely-held private companies. Presently, the minority shareholders or companies which are not publicly listed and have no recourse to the law are not able to dispose of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> shares. They are not able to take action on behalf of the company against the directors who abuse their position. The only remedy is to take the company to Court on oppression and if the case proven, will result in a liquidation of the company. I, therefore, welcome this law, especially it relates to companies which are not listed on the Stock Exchange, as this seems to be a prevalent problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the new sections 216A and 216B are also applicable to public-listed companies, we have a situation, which has already been mentioned by Mr Leong, whereby a shareholder owning one share or 1,000 shares can take action on behalf of the company against the directors, or on behalf of the company. This, in my view, will likely lead to increased litigation where a simple complaint against a public-listed company to the Stock Exchange will usually provoke a response from the directors. So the new section 216A which applies to public-listed companies can have a lot of dire consequences for our stock market. You can imagine a situation whereby a minority shareholder has some information which he thinks is relevant and if the Court grants him leave to take action on behalf of the company. This will likely affect the share price. And in trying to protect the minority shareholders, it may penalise them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some European legislation, as a safeguard, the intending litigants must usually hold a certain proportion of the shares, and Mr Leong has already suggested 5%. In other words, one cannot take action against SIA unless one owns 5% of the shares and not 1,000 shares. So by providing a legal framework for redress which, I believe, is based on the Canadian model, it is something which we must try to avoid. Derivative action is very popular in North America, especially in the US. And what we must bear in mind is that what is necessary for North America is not healthy and necessarily good for Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I strongly urge the Minister to commit this Bill to a Select Committee so that some of these additional safeguards and provisions can be worked out, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Walter Woon (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill, but not in its entirety. Like the curate's egg, some parts of it are good, but not all of it. Before I proceed further, may I declare my interest as a director of a listed company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said, the provisions in the Bill actually fall into two distinct parts - the provisions that deal with the amendments to the Companies Act and the provisions that deal basically with the Central Depository system. It is to the latter that I will confine my observations, leaving my comments on the former to the Committee stage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logical way to implement a scripless trading system is to first change the law and then design the system. The SES has chosen to do it the other way. They change the system first and now this House is being asked to change the law to accommodate the system. What we have is a system that is not entirely efficient because it still requires share certificates to be issued and share certificates to be registered. And the reason why this less than efficient system has been chosen is that the law was not changed first to enable a company to completely dematerialise scrip. The result is a very unsatisfactory situation - a law which has little coherence and a system which is not entirely efficient. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the provisions in the Amendment Bill, you will see that they are focused entirely from the view of the SES and the Central Depository. The two groups of persons who were most intimately concerned with scripless trading are not taken care of at all. These are the listed companies whose shares are going to be traded on a scripless basis and investors who are being asked to put their money in the market. The interest of these two parties, I submit, have not been adequately taken care of. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the scripless trading system will improve matters, improve security for small investors. May I respectfully differ from him on this. The system has loopholes through which you could drive a double-decker bus and that invites massive fraud. What we have got is the equivalent of a current account but with shares instead of cash. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the hon. Members of this House to consider whether they would consider operating a current account under the following circumstances. Firstly, the bank holding your money does not have to have a cheque or written instruction to pay away your money. Secondly, the bank can debit your account on the instruction of someone who claims to be your broker. In fact, you have no choice about this because you cannot give instructions to them directly. Thirdly, they will send you a statement of account quarterly, and unless you challenge this within seven days, the statement is deemed to be conclusive. Fourthly, if the bank mistakenly pays away your money without your consent, it is not for them to prove that you have consented. It is for you to prove that you did not consent. And fifthly, if the bank pays away your money without your consent, you cannot sue them even if they did so negligently. Would any of the hon. Members consider running a current account under these circumstances? Yet this is the very system that we are being asked to approve in this Bill applying to shares, this is precisely what can be done under the present scripless trading system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the House some examples of how fraud is facilitated under the new system. I hesitate to do this in such a public forum, lest we give encouragement to crooks. But I think it has to be said. Firstly, the bent financial controller. You have a company that invests money in shares. Under the present system, the scrip is kept by a custodian. Under the scripless system, there is no custodian because there is no scrip. Let us assume the financial controller of this company is a crook. He instructs the company's broker to sell the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> company's entire portfolio of shares. Under the present system, this will not benefit him one jot because he has to make delivery of the shares before he would get payment. Under the scripless system, he instructs, the broker will sell. The CDP will debit the company's account, the cheque will come to the company. If you are in the position of a financial controller there are any number of ways you can get the money out of the company once it comes. How do you protect yourself against this? I have asked various people - internal auditors, external auditors, 8stock brokers - and nobody has been able to give an adequate answer, short of keeping your shares out of the scripless system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the dishonest dealer. If you have a dishonest dealer or remisier. At present, a dealer or remisier cannot sell his client's shares unless he has access to his client's scrip. So you are very careful. You make sure that your dealer or remisier does not hold on to your scrip. Under the scripless system, no scrip is required. So whoever knows your CDP account number and your client number can sell your shares without your consent and without your knowledge. The cheque, of course, will be crossed in your name but I have asked brokers whether it is possible for a dealer or remisier to get money that is payable to a client and they have told me how. If anyone would like to know, I will be happy to tell them after this. But I think perhaps it would not be a good idea to make it public in this way. But it can be done. So you could wake up one day and find that your dealer or remisier has sold all your shares, taken your money, and is winging his way to Taiwan without you knowing it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, fraud by directors of broking firms. What can be done by a dealer or remisier will only affect a few clients. But the director of a broking firm, if he is a crook, can clean up the entire firm's clientele at one fell swoop. Can the Minister assure us that we will have no more Pan Electric-type situations and the directors of the broking firms now and forever more will be paragons of virtue? If a director of a broking firm has access \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to a client's numbers and client's accounts, he can instruct sale. He can do it by way of a married deal bypassing the usual safeguards. The cheque will come and, being a director of a broking firm, there will be again any number of ways he can convert the money to his own use. It only takes one crook to destroy the reputation of Singapore as a financial centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem is not only the question of fraud. The problem is that the system is also open to human error. What happens if a dealer miskeys the client's account? I am told this happens all the time. It is not unknown. He miskeys the client's account. What happens under the present system is that there is a manual reconciliation at the end of the day. The system kicks out a list. The dealer then compares the list with his own list of trades and he reconciles the two. And if there are any mistakes, the trade can be recalled within two days, I am told. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the dealer does not do this? People are human. They are fallible. The dealer may be tired after a long day. He may want to go home to the wife and the kids. He may be off for a long week-end. He does not do his proper job. So the error creeps through. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The client gets a notification. He calls the broking firm. He says, \"I never told you to sell. Why did you sell?\" The dealer, to save his own skin, lies. He says, \"You told me to sell.\" His word against the broker's word. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present scrip system, if a client declines to make delivery, the broking firm will buy in against him and sue him. The broking firm will have the burden of proof. They will have to prove that the client gave the order. Under the scripless system, the CDP will debit the client's account. The client will then have to sue the broking firm. The client will have to prove that he did not give the order. How does one prove a negative? And when you talk about small investors, can a small investor afford to sue a broking firm? A broking firm has the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> resources to fight a small investor to a standstill. So the net result will be that if a mistake of this sort is made, the small investor will lose out. Your retiree who has put his life savings, your little old lady who does not know what else to do with her money, will find themselves cleaned out by mistake. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is actually worse than this. Even if the mistake is discovered, there is no provision for stopping the trade. The client cannot call CDP and say, \"Look, there was a mistake. Do not debit my account.\" At least with a current account, you can stop the cheque. In the case of CDP, there is no such provision. The trade goes through whether or not it is a mistake and you leave the small investor to his remedy against the broking firm. As I said, the net result will be that the broking firm will get away with it and the small investor will lose out totally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is troubling about all these examples is that they are not unknown. I raised some of these problems two years ago at a conference on regulation of the market. Since then, there has been deafening silence from the Stock Exchange. If an outsider can think of all these scams, I shudder to think what the insiders who are familiar with the system will be thinking of at present. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly urge the Minister not to push the amendments through until the Stock Exchange can assure the public that the problems have been addressed. We cannot pretend that the problems do not exist. It has never been this Government's style to ignore a problem until it becomes a crisis. If there is a major scandal, people will want to know why the problem was not foreseen and dealt with. It will be catastrophic for our reputation as a financial centre if the problems were foreseen but they were not dealt with because of the desire to push through a flawed system as fast as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SES is pushing for listed companies to go scripless by June 1993. Some companies, including INTRACO, on whose board I sit, have expressed reservations about doing so until the law \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is settled. A responsible company director cannot recommend changes to a company's Articles of Association until the law is clear, nor can a responsible board recommend scripless trading until they are satisfied that the shareholders' interests are fully protected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major problems of the scripless system, as I have said, is that there is no written confirmation of any trade, and this is a fundamental problem. If you say we are going to have this scripless system without a written confirmation, then you must be prepared for this kind of fraud. If, on the other hand, you say we need a written confirmation like you need a cheque when a bank debits your current account, then the system will have to be revamped. And this cannot be done, I think, in one sitting today. The Bill will have to go to a Select Committee, at the very least. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make another suggestion? May I urge the Minister to extend the stamp duty exemption for shares that are deposited with the CDP? The stamp duty exemption for deposit of shares expires in June 1993. Because of the reservations that some companies have expressed, they will not meet the 1993 deadline. The shareholders of these companies should not be penalised because their directors are taking a cautious view. Moreover, if the system goes through in its present form, ie, without requiring a written confirmation of a trade, the only way you can protect yourself adequately against fraud is to take your shares out of the system and redeposit them when you want to trade. That is why I urge the Minister to extend the stamp duty exemption for people who do want to redeposit later on, because they want to protect themselves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other drafting problems with the Companies (Amendment) Bill, as suggested, but I think I will reserve my comments for the Committee stage. May I, however, make two suggestions in addition to supporting the Members who spoke before me by asking that this Bill \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> go before a Select Committee? My first suggestion is that I strongly urge the Minister to take the sections dealing with the CDP out of the Companies Act. They do not belong in the Companies Act. The vast majority of companies will never be listed, much less be traded scripless. They belong properly in something like the Securities Industry Act. Or like in Malaysia, in a separate Act of its own. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities Industry Act also needs revision. So may I also urge the Minister to form a Law Reform Committee to look into the question of revising the Securities Industry Act, the by-laws, the rules as well as the sections on the CDP so that they form a coherent whole? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion basically relates to the Companies Act as a whole. Our Companies Act is a legal equivalent of a platypus. It has got bits of different animals stuck together. The basic structure is copied from a British Act of 1948 which was based on a British Act of 1929. We have amended it and re-amended it, copying Australian sections, English sections, American sections and bits of our own. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonder is not that it is flawed. The wonder is that it works at all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last decade, there have been four major amendments to the Companies Act. This is the fifth. This cannot be satisfactory from the point of view of businessmen and lawyers who have to live with this kind of thing from day to day. So may I suggest to the Minister that he set up a proper Company Law Reform Commission to look into a coherent revision of the Companies Act. The Australian Act has been revised. The English Act has been revised. Our Act just putters along in the 1948 form. With respect to the overworked Parliamentary Counsel in the Attorney-General's Chambers, I do not think they can do this revision themselves. You need people with practical knowledge of how the law works to do this. Company law is far too important to be left in the hands of the lawyers alone. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item under discussion and the remaining items on the Order Paper today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just wish to state my support for the Bill in respect of the amendment to section 328 of the Companies Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 328 expressly provides that retrenchment benefits payable to an employee under any contract of service shall in a winding up rank third in priority and shall be paid in advance of other unsecured debts. We have in the past a number of cases in which workers were denied compensation in a winding up. This inflicts hardship on employees and it is extremely unfair to those who have put in years of service with the company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two previous cases involving Vosper Thornycroft and President Merlin Hotel, the company liquidators disputed the union's claims for retrenchment benefits. The cases were heard in the High Court, but the court ruled that the retrenchment benefits which were provided in the collective agreement did not apply in a winding up. As a result, the workers lost their jobs without receiving any compensation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC had made several representations to the Government to have the Act amended. I am glad that this amendment Bill has incorporated the changes sought by the unions. It has provided added protection to the workers and I therefore support this section of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like first to thank the many Members who have spoken in support of the main aspects of the Bill. However, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Members have also expressed concern and sought clarifications over many areas of the Bill. There have also been requests from Members that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the debate has focused on two major amendments in the Bill. The first is the part which concerns with the establishment of the central depository system and the electronic book system for the transfer of securities listed on the SES. The second is clause 22 which provides more effective remedies for the rights of minority shareholders of corporations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first case, Members have expressed concern over the electronic transfer system which may expose investors to many risks, eloquently described by Mr Woon, arising from errors in the electronic recordings of transactions and that there may be insufficient safeguards to protect investors' interests against fraud and negligence on the part of the central depository. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I should point out that the proposed legislation has been under consideration for well over a year and a half. It has been discussed extensively with members of the Stock Exchange, the Merchant Bankers' Association and the Association of Banks. Furthermore, the draft legislation has been considered and approved by the Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy of Law and, I believe, Mr Woon had participated in some of these activities. However, if he has now further thoughts on the legal aspects of this Bill, I think his points are taken and will be considered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Woon has suggested that the structure of the operation of the central depository system should perhaps require the transferee to execute a signed transfer form. I believe this is what he would like to see. Unfortunately, the whole purpose of creating a legal framework for electronic share transfer is to do away with paper transfers. To implement a system which only partially deals with this problem will defeat the purpose of the exercise and will not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> enable us to reap the benefits of a completely paperless system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern over lack of controls of the proposed book entry system is, I think, not entirely warranted, as the CDP is required to send a confirmation note to account holders for every transaction. In addition, they are required to send periodic statements of the balance of the securities accounts for verification. It is also provided in the regulations for external auditors to verify the records of the CDP and the report will have to be sent to the relevant authorities for review. In the regulations, the MAS would also have power to supervise the operations of the CDP. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, there is a growing trend to a scripless settlement system in major world markets. Such a system enhances productivity significantly by eliminating the need for huge backroom support staff to assist in the settlement and clearance of trades. In a world where securities markets continue to globalise, efficiency and cost are important factors of ensuring whether a particular market can succeed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Woon has also suggested that the CDP section of the amendment Bill should be taken out of the Companies Act altogether and be placed perhaps in the Securities Industry Act or in a separate Act altogether. This is a possibility, of course, but the current Companies Act provides for the scrip system of ownership. So it appears logical that the scripless system should, in fact, follow from this legislation. However, it is something which we can debate later. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that many other countries are in different stages of implementing the scripless settlement system in their stock exchanges in order to take advantage of their efficiencies. Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia and Japan have, in one form or another, implemented computerised systems. Malaysia is also about to introduce the central depository system, starting with stocks listed on the KLSE second board. In the UK, the much publicised Taurus system, when \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> implemented, will similarly provide for electronic settlement of securities transactions. In the United States, the deposit trust company operates a depository system which immobilises physical share certificates in much the same form as we are proposing in this Bill and effects transfer by way of book entries to securities accounts maintained by participating financial institutions in it. Members should also note that in countries which have long experienced the book-entry system of securities settlement, such as the United States, there is substantial evidence that the opportunities for and incidence of loss of scrips or fraud are sharply reduced, as control and detection are enhanced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second case, Members are mainly concerned over the provision of clause 22, as it may open the door to a flood of frivolous or petty applications by disgruntled minority shareholders. Although I believe that adequate safeguards have been built into the legislation, the concerns will be addressed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding what I have just said, the unanimity with which Members have requested that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee suggests that the concerns are widespread and may extend beyond this House. In view of this, I intend to propose to this House that the Bill should be committed to a Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will touch on one aspect of questions raised that has got nothing to do with the Central Depository system or clause 22, and this is the question raised for clarification on why the retrenchment compensation should be limited to $7,500. The ceiling of five months' salary or $7,500, whichever is the lesser, is based on the ceiling currently provided under the Companies Act which allows for wages and salaries not exceeding five months' salary or $6,250, whichever is the lesser, to be ranked second in priority after the costs and expenses of winding up. The rationale for the quantum of $1,250 per month was that it was in harmony with the Employment Act where $1,250 per month is the cut- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> off for those non-manual workers deemed to be deserving of statutory protection with regard to conditions of service, such as overtime hours and service and so on. It is also the cut-off for non-manual workers covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceiling of $6,250 or five months' salary was to strike a balance between the rights of workers and managers on the one hand, and other unsecured creditors on the other, in a winding up. At the same time, it would preserve the interests of workers as it is unlikely that the five months' salary of workers would exceed $6,250. And equally important, it will serve to ensure that managers and executives who are generally on more generous retrenchment terms do not receive in priority disproportionate sums in retrenchment benefits relative to workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when the provision was proposed under the Companies (Amendment) Bill of 1986, the bulk of unionised workers were either production workers or clerical workers. The average monthly salaries of these workers were $645 and $737, inclusive of overtime and allowances, respectively. These were 1985 figures obtained from the Annual Labour Force Survey. The cap of $6,250 would not, therefore, compromise their position as it was well above the ceiling of five months' salary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Companies (Amendment) Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and such Members as the Committee of Selection may nominate. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ENDANGERED SPECIES (IMPORT AND EXPORT) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has decided to amend the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act to ban domestic trade in rhinoceros products and any gazetted species. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act was enacted in March 1989 to give effect to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). Currently, the Act controls only the import and export of endangered species. This Bill seeks to make it an offence to sell, offer, or expose for sale or display to the public any species gazetted by the Minister. For the time being, only rhinoceros products will be gazetted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As CITES considers the rhinoceros one of the most endangered wild life species, it called for a complete ban on all trade, including domestic trade, in rhinoceros products in July 1987. However, this call from CITES is not binding on its members. Singapore has already banned the import and export of rhinoceros horns since October 1986. At the time of the enactment of the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act, domestic trade in rhinoceros products was allowed to continue to enable our local retailers to run down their existing stocks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now, local retailers have had more than five years since October 1986 to run down their existing stocks. Therefore, the ban on domestic trade in rhinoceros products should not have serious impact on our local retailers. I should also add that the ban on rhinoceros products, particularly the rhinoceros horn, would not have any serious impact on the public. For those who believe that rhinoceros horn is useful in reducing fever, there are close substitutes. They can either take antelope horn or simply take a Panadol. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, international support of CITES has called for the ban on domestic trade in rhinoceros products and this has gathered momentum. Countries like Hong Kong and Macau have taken steps to implement the ban. This Amendment Bill to ban domestic trade in rhinoceros products will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> demonstrate Singapore's concern for the protection of endangered wild life species. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EDUCATION ENDOWMENT SCHEME BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to establish an Education Endowment Scheme through the setting up of an Edusave Endowment Fund. The Prime Minister first announced this Edusave scheme in December 1990. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Edusave scheme will be launched in January next year with an initial capital sum of $1,000 million or $1 billion. The fund will be built up over the years from the Government's annual budgetary surplus to a target sum of $5,000 million or $5 billion. This is a massive sum by any standard and will be achieved only if Singaporeans continue to work together and there is sound economic growth. In comparison, it cost the Government about as much to build the MRT. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income generated by the Edusave Endowment Fund will benefit younger Singaporeans who are still in school as well as future generations to come. They will receive Edusave contributions paid into their individual Edusave accounts which can be used for educational purposes or be saved up. They will also benefit from educational programmes funded by Edusave and they can compete for Edusave scholarships. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike many countries which are in financial difficulties, Singaporeans are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> indeed fortunate if we can continue to enjoy healthy economic growth and generate enough surplus over the years to put aside $5 billion for further investment in education. The total impact of the Edusave scheme will be large when measured in terms of the sum total of benefits to be enjoyed over the years by many generations of Singaporeans. This investment in education is over and above the 4% of our GDP which the Government currently spends yearly on education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In designing the Edusave scheme, the Government has applied the following principles: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Edusave is an investment in our people. It is not a welfare scheme. For the needy, there are various bursary and other financial assistance schemes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Edusave should encourage Singaporeans to work hard, to be productive, to save and to excel. The build-up of the Edusave Endowment Fund will depend on economic growth generated by Singaporeans' collective efforts. There will be Edusave scholarships for all secondary schools to encourage their pupils to excel in their studies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to benefit Singaporeans who have contributed to Singapore's prosperity, earnings from the Edusave Endowment Fund will be distributed to the Edusave accounts of all eligible pupils. Those pupils and their parents who do not need the money can donate it to the pupils' schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, parents should continue to be responsible for financing part of their children's education, at least to the extent of the standard school and miscellaneous fees. These fees cannot be paid from Edusave. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A main objective of the Edusave scheme is to enhance the quality of education in our schools. Therefore, the eligible programmes will be school-based and the eligible pupils will be those studying full-time at our schools. Our schools will have the flexibility to introduce enhancement programmes to meet their pupils' needs, making use of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the annual grants from Edusave or paid for from the pupils' Edusave accounts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system provides 10 years of schooling before pupils join the job market or proceed to post-secondary education or training. It is therefore equitable to set the age limit at 6 to 16 years, so that all eligible pupils will receive 10 years of Edusave benefits. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with our population policy of \"Have 3 or more if you can afford it\", the Edusave scheme will be limited to three children per mother. Parents who can afford more than three children should provide for the additional children themselves. We do not want to unwittingly encourage those parents who cannot support a big family to have more children. Edusave is not a population incentive scheme to encourage parents to have more children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now briefly highlight the key aspects of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 provide for the establishment of the Edusave Endowment Fund with capital money provided by Parliament. The capital money can only be used for investment in accordance with the Financial Procedure Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 sets out the purposes for which the income of the Edusave Fund may be expended. These include the provision of grants to schools to enable them to enhance the quality of teaching, provision of scholarships to deserving pupils and distribution of contributions to all eligible pupils. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 authorises the CPF Board to administer the Edusave Pupils Fund and to maintain an Edusave account for every eligible pupil who then becomes a member of the Edusave Pupils Fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 provides for an Advisory Council to be set up to advise the Minister on the application of the income of the Edusave Endowment Fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions for withdrawal of money from the Edusave Pupils Fund are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> spelt out in clause 12. Members may use their Edusave money to pay for expenses connected with any school-based extra-curricular activity or enhancement programme, to pay for school or miscellaneous fees above the basic amount or for such other purposes as may be prescribed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 enables the member or his parent, as the case may be, to donate money in the member's Edusave account to his school. It also empowers the CPF Board to transfer the Edusave funds of any member who has attained 21 years of age into his CPF account. However, he may apply to retain the money in his Edusave account to pay for further education or training. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is drawing up guidelines on the withdrawal and application of funds in pupils' Edusave accounts for educational purposes. I intend to keep the Edusave scheme as simple as possible to reduce administrative cost but with adequate safeguards to prevent abuse. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the future progress and prosperity of Singapore depends on the education and training of our people. The Edusave scheme is a concrete step to further improve the quality of our education. The aim is to maximise and equalise opportunities for Singaporeans to improve themselves. With Edusave funds to assist them, more Singaporeans will have similar opportunities to enhance their education. They will all have a better start in life. How well they succeed will depend on their own abilities and effort. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the Edusave scheme is not a welfare project. It is a scheme which will benefit the present students and the younger generation of Singaporeans. This will enhance the quality of education in our schools which, in turn, will train and nurture the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> younger generation to become useful citizens. Therefore, the setting up of the Edusave fund is a bold and massive investment by the Government in the field of education. To a certain extent, it will give our parents and students the opportunity to choose the learning programmes they prefer. Pupils from less-to-do families will no longer be shut off from the learning of piano, ballet, swimming or other interesting subjects. I am particularly glad that under the scheme, pupils from well-to-do families are allowed to donate their entitlement in the fund to the school, so that more pupils from poor families may benefit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edusave scheme aims to maximise the use of human resources and it acts as a long-term investment to train the right person for the right job. I hope that the Government will publicise extensively and make the necessary explanations regarding the utilisation of the fund. This will help to avoid the Edusave scheme from being misinterpreted as a welfare project. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Edusave scheme should be confined to the enhancement programmes which are educational in nature and which will benefit the students, such as piano lessons, ballet, Chinese instrumental music, oriental dances, Malay language, Japanese language, swimming, or the provision of educational facilities like purchasing more library books, teaching aids, or computers to improve the educational standard of the pupils. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that remedial and tutorial classes should continue for those who are weak, but they should not be included as part of the Edusave scheme. Similarly, courses organised by private schools should not be included in the Edusave scheme. This will prevent the private schools from raising their fees and thereby resulting in the misuse of Edusave fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Edusave fund should not be used for purchase of air-conditioners, sofa, tables and chairs for the teachers and staff, as these are irrelevant to the enhancement of educational quality. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the proposed Advisory Council would furnish all the schools, parents and students with effective guidelines to prevent any misuse of the fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the aforesaid, I suggest that the penalty for anyone who misused the fund should be increased to a fine of not more than $5,000 or ten times the amount which was misused, in order to have any deterrent effect. In addition, in times of economic difficulties, this project should be suspended immediately so that this meaningful educational endowment scheme will not become an additional financial burden to the nation, in a time of crisis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Education Endowment Scheme Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Edusave Endowment Fund is recognition of the fact that education is an investment in our people, our greatest asset. By setting aside funds every year, specifically for education, the Government will provide for the educational needs of the people in the long term. Funding for education need not be dependent on the vagaries of the Budget which must be tailored to the economic performance of Singapore in each particular year. As the Minister for Education has pointed out, the Endowment Fund can be built up in good years from the fruits of the economic growth generated by the collective efforts of all Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lean years, when high standards of educational attainment and training are crucial to our survival and well-being, the Fund can continue to be used to finance quality education programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective of the Fund, therefore, is to enhance and enrich the quality of education in our schools. The availability of financing by grants from the Endowment Fund or the use of the pupils' Edusave would permit schools to introduce enhancement programmes to meet their pupils' needs and interests. The schools are the best institutions to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> determine and run suitable programmes and the use of the Fund should be limited to school-based programmes. One worthy exception could be community-based education programmes that complement the efforts of the schools and which cater to the specific needs of each community. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usage of the Edusave Endowment Fund is governed by clause 6 of the Bill. This clause 6, as worded, is very wide indeed. The Fund can only be used for programmes to complement the basic education presently provided. The Ministry of Education must resist the temptation to use the Endowment Fund to fund its normal budgetary requirements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisory Council to be established under clause 10 will play an important role in ensuring this. The composition of this Council is very important. Parents must be adequately represented as the best means to ensure effective and efficient use of the Fund is to give parents the final say, both as taxpayers as well as people, who could make the right decision for their children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Edusave Endowment Fund will be used to fund scholarships for our brighter students, for grants to schools and to fund the Edusave accounts of individual pupils. The most important of these would be the grants to schools. Whilst scholarships will help and reward the brighter pupils, the grants to schools will ensure that the Fund is spent equitably and benefits the entire student population. Individual schools would be able to use the grants to fund a wide range of activities. Neighbourhood schools would be able to develop unique programmes and carve themselves a niche in a particular area of academic or extra-curricular activity. They can also use the funds made available to them to improve their infrastructure. The School Advisory Committees can play an important role in advising the principals and in raising funds to supplement the Endowment Fund grants. This would help avoid the danger that the grants are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> spent on a minority of students or on white elephant projects. The Ministry can give broad guidelines but must ensure that these are not too stifling. The grants will enable neighbourhood schools to attain some of the flexibility that our independent schools now possess. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has not mentioned whether primary schools will be given the grants at this stage. The Fund is intended to enrich the education provided to our children. It is important to start such enrichment programmes at a young age. For example, the aesthetic appreciation for the arts is best instilled at a young age. The Ministry should consider extending the grants to primary schools at this stage or as soon as is possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of the Edusave Pupils Fund recognises that although there is a good quality uniform education system for all, the Government is willing to give parents choices in enrichment programmes. Edusave Pupils Fund is particularly beneficial to the less well-off Singaporeans who have the greatest need for Government assistance as well as the well-to-do who already sent their children for such activities at their own expense. However, the usage of the Edusave Pupils Fund must be controlled as parents must still be responsible for the basic costs of education such as school and miscellaneous fees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edusave is not a welfare scheme and there are various bursaries and other financial means for those who face difficulties in meeting these basic fees. It would be useful for the Ministry to indicate the type of programmes that can make use of Edusave Fund so as to avoid any misunderstanding that may arise from false expectations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Edusave accounts will also not be opened for children who are the fourth child and so on. Although the Government's intention is to discourage poorer families from having more than three children, I feel that this would deprive poorer families that have more than three children presently, and it is these children that need the assistance most. Depriving them of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> opportunities that Edusave can provide will shut the door to enrichment programmes that they can benefit from and which would help them climb higher in the socio-economic ladder. The Ministry can perhaps consider implementing the three-child cap per family for children born after the policy is implemented. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system provides for 10 years of schooling before students join the job market or proceed to post-secondary education or training. The Edusave balances of Singaporeans between the ages of 16 and 21 years can be used for vocational and technical training and for young workers to upgrade their skills. Clause 13 of the Bill provides that the unused Edusave balance in each pupil's account would be transferred to his CPF ordinary account. The drawback of this provision is that it is possible that some parents may not bother to ensure that their children actually use the funds and enjoy the benefits of this scheme. Edusave is not intended to be a hand-out, but it is intended to give a boost to the education of our children. Parents must therefore be informed and educated on the uses of Edusave. The schools will play an important role in ensuring this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to say that the Education Endowment Scheme Bill underscores the importance that the Government places on the education of its citizens. It is also heartening to note that we have moved beyond the provision of basic education and can now look forward to a more flexible and innovative approach. This is an important step in our climb towards achieving our vision of a 1984 Swiss standard of living in 1999. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the General Election held last August, the Government made several promises. Amongst them were the Edusave scheme and the Open University. The voters were impressed. Singaporeans all know the importance of education to advance themselves in life. They must have believed the Government's promise, or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> else the PAP surely would have lost more than four seats when the Election results were announced. What happened after the Election? The people waited. There was only silence in relation to the Edusave Scheme and the Open University. Instead the people heard of massive increases in medical and hospital charges and other increases consequent to Government policies. Then came the announcement. The Government decided not to carry on with the Open University, as promised. The Open University was to be handed over to the private sector to start up and manage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the Edusave scheme? Here again, the Government has deviated from the election promise. The scheme spelt out in the Education Endowment Scheme Bill, that is before us, is different from what was told to the voters in August 1991. It was announced then that for the whole of a child's school life, the sum of $100 was to be credited to his Edusave account per year, purportedly to pay for the child's school fees and whatever his basic educational needs. Even at that time, the feedback from the public was that the sum of $100 per year was paltry, taking into account that private tutors were already charging $100 per subject per month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we have in the Bill that is before us? The total income from the Endowment Fund is not to be credited to the school children but only part of it. The rest goes to the Government and Government-aided schools as provision for grants and scholarships. On this point of scholarships, I would like to ask the Minister whether, from now on, the scholarship awards payable to the President's and Merit Scholars shall be taken out of the income of the Edusave Endowment Fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the income of the Endowment Fund to be divided between so many contesting groups, I would like the Minister to clarify (1) how will the grants be allotted to the schools, especially between the independent and Government schools, and how much; (2) will there be a separate scholarship \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> scheme; and (3) whatever amount is left over, how will they pay to each pupil per year. Will it be less than the sum of $100 touted at the last General Election? Perhaps, the Minister could clarify. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another disturbing proposal of the Bill is that the withdrawals from the pupil's Edusave account can only be used to pay for extra-curricular activities or for enhancement programmes. This proposal for the payment of only ECA and enhancement programmes is very disturbing. I believe that it will be very restrictive. It will not really benefit the pupils. I do not know whether the Minister has any special reason. If he has, he should tell us because, as I see it, the use of Edusave fund for the payment of only ECA and enhancement programmes would attract adverse educational consequences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment out of Edusave for ECA and enhancement programmes would, to me, mean two things. First, the teachers are going to be expected to be paid when they conduct ECA classes and, second, the schools shall be charging for ECA. When I was a teacher in the 60s, ECA programmes were all free of charge, whether it be sports, games, or non-athletic programmes, like folk-dancing, photography or even in the uniformed groups. I hope that with the implementation of this Edusave programme whereby Edusave can only be used for ECA, all this will not be charged. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that to give additional monetary incentives to teachers to conduct ECA is wrong. When the teachers are properly motivated, they can, of course, give of their best without monetary incentives. More importantly, when the teachers unselfishly spend long hours after school hours to teach and impart skills, the pupils can learn valuable lessons from the dedication, selflessness and commitment of their teachers. But, with this Bill, I am afraid that it will do away with all that. Some principals are going to be thrown overboard and, in their place, short- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sighted mercenary incentives are to take its place. If what I say is true, ie, the Edusave money can only be used for ECA, and at the moment ECA are free of charge, but if the Government is going to charge for ECA, then what the Government is giving out with one hand will be collected back with the other. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, for the Government to set aside part of its budget surplus to invest in education and to set up the Edusave Fund for the benefit of our students, instead of carrying on using the surplus fund to generate more and more funds to continue to build up a reserve which is already strong, is indeed a wise move. In my view, a good Government should not only be good in generating wealth, but should also be good in making use of the wealth it has generated. Spend on the people what you have taken from the people. Therefore, in principle, I support the Government's move to invest in education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with regard to the particulars and standard of the Edusave scheme announced by the Ministry of Education, so far, I have the following queries: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Ministry announced that those who are among the top 25% in the PSLE and who have applied for enrolment in the independent schools will be awarded, at one go, a scholarship for four years. Is the Ministry of Education of the view that these students who did well in their PSLE will necessarily do well in their entire four years' studies in the secondary schools? Or is this meant to be just a one-time incentive only, and its effect will last as long as four years? On the other hand, those students who go to Government-aided or Government schools will have to be re-assessed every year and be among the top 10% in their respective schools to be entitled to this scholarship award. Is the Ministry of Education holding the view that good students who go to independent schools will necessarily maintain their good performance every year, but the good students who go to the Government- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> aided or Government schools will not necessarily maintain their good results every year, and they will have to be re-assessed every year to qualify for the scholarship award? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government announced that with effect from next year, it will set aside $12 million per year for the Edusave Endowment Fund Scholarship. Of the $12 million, $6 million will be given to scholarships for the independent schools and the other $6 million for scholarships in the Government-aided and Government schools. On the surface, this appears to be a fair distribution. However, there are only six independent schools in Singapore while there are 132 Government-aided and Government schools. On the average, every independent school will get $1 million while the other Government-aided and Government schools will get less than $50,000 each. So, is this a fair allocation? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, for the independent schools, each scholarship award can be worth as much as $2,400 per year. Yet in the Government-aided and Government schools, each scholarship award is worth only $300 to $500 per year. So if the scholarship scheme is aimed at encouraging the better students, irrespective of their family background, to carry on working hard, then so long as their results are good, these good students should be awarded equally. However, under the present scholarship scheme, those who are among the top 25% in the PSLE results, but who choose to go to the Government-aided or Government secondary schools, will be awarded only $300 to $500 per year. Even then, they will have to remain among the top 10% of their respective schools each year to be entitled to these awards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, if the student chooses to go to an independent school, he can be awarded, at one go, a four-year scholarship of $2,400 per year, totalling $9,600. So, there is a world of difference in terms of awards for students who go to independent schools and for those who go to non-independent schools, although they may attain equally good \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> results in the same PSLE. Then, is this scholarship really a scheme to encourage students to work hard in order to achieve good results, as announced by the Prime Minister, or is it meant to encourage students with better results to seek enrolment in the independent schools? If the Government's reason is that the fees in the independent schools are higher, therefore the scholarship award should also be higher, then the wise parents and the brighter students, in consideration of the economic benefits, will naturally opt for the independent schools because the students will not only enjoy better school facilities and better care there, they will also enjoy a scholarship award of $9,600, whereas a student who opts to enrol in a Government-aided or Government school will get only $300 to $500 per year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, is it not apparent that the establishment of this scholarship scheme will serve to encourage those who are among the top 25% of the students at the PSLE to go to the independent schools? In the long run, will it not end up with the independent schools being labelled as first-class schools, and the Government-aided and Government schools be deemed to be second-class or even, third-class schools? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tay Eng Soon, the Senior Minister of State for Education, said in Parliament this year that attempts were being made to enable neighbourhood schools to attract good students as well. Yet, in the present situation, how are the neighbourhood schools ever going to attract students with good PSLE results to be enrolled there, so that these neighbourhood schools would have a chance to rise head and shoulders above others! My worry is that under this scholarship scheme, the ordinary schools will never have a chance to stand up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Mr Speaker, Sir, this scholarship scheme awards only those among the top 25% of the students in the independent schools and the top 10% of the students in the Government-aided and Government schools. What about those whose results fall short of the best but are better than the rest, and are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> good enough to be admitted to the independent schools, as well as those who choose to go to the Government-aided or Government schools and whose results are above average? Should they not be given some form of incentive to encourage them to work their way up? Will the Ministry of Education consider setting aside some money from the Edusave Fund to award some sort of \"Diligence Prize\" to these students whose results are above average? By so doing, those students whose results are not so good will be encouraged to work harder to catch up with those in the middle, thereby generally boosting the morale of our students, and in the process attain the target of enhancing our national educational level. Finally, Mr Speaker, I hope that the Ministry of Education would announce the details of this Edusave Scheme as soon as possible. For example, how much will every student be entitled to every year from the Edusave Fund? In the long-run, will the Government consider increasing the quantum of the Edusave Fund and the scholarship annually, so that all our students will benefit? As we all know, the Government's theory is to keep on increasing the charges for every service it provides, including school fees, and the fees for participating in activities and programmes which are capable of enriching the physical and mental well-being of the students. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Umar Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Umar Abdul Hamid (Ang Mo Kio GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Education Endowment Scheme through which the Edusave Pupils Fund will also be launched next January will bear an initial capital of $1 billion. The Fund will build up until it is capable of reaching an impressive sum of $5 billion. This is an enormous fund that can only be successfully raised if the people are committed to progress and productivity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income that is derived from this Fund is meant for the benefit of the pupils in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> primary and secondary schools, especially for the needy. This move is most welcome. It only goes to prove the continuous existence of a government that strives for the promotion of its most valuable asset, its people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme is primarily an investment for which everyone stands to gain. An introductory allocation of $50 per pupil is not a small amount to those that await for such assistance. In addition, if this amount is saved throughout the years, it will amount to a big sum by virtue of the income derived from its use. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme also allows our pupils to participate in more enrichment programmes without the monetary factor as a demotivational element. If I may suggest at this juncture, for the Malay pupils who are in need of further guidance in Mathematics they should be given the leeway to use the Fund in a manner that helps them to overcome the problem. It may come in the form of subsidizing tuition fees after school hours where tutors could be employed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still a matter of fact that there are still a disturbing percentage of Malay pupils who could not afford to pay for home tuitions that are run by concerned organisations even though the rates offered conform to market rates. In the face of a meritocratic system where competition runs high in every aspect of life, these pupils might be left lagging behind. I have been made to understand that there are still problems of pupils who are so lacking in means that they could hardly afford a second school shirt. There are also cases made known to me of pupils who would go on for months without the required textbooks and materials, simply because there is not enough money to go around and the family income marginally over-qualifies for the school's bursary limits. These pupils normally come from families that are constantly bogged down with problems. It will be a plus point if this scheme allows a certain degree of flexibility to accommodate such circumstances that I have cited. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I proceed, may I have some clarification from the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Ministry of Education over these doubts of mine? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is with regard to clause 6 (1)(a) of the Bill. Will the Ministry kindly elaborate on how the distribution of grants to schools is going to be carried out? Is it based on the school's performance or is it simply given to a school according to its pupil population? Is it both or neither of them? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happens to be a crucial factor for it leads to the objective of this proposed scheme. It may not necessarily be true all the time that schools with the highest enrolment produce the best standard or the best pupils or vice-versa. If the grant is to be allocated according to the number of pupils, then I believe the objective of this scheme will be best met via the enhancement of the quality of teaching and its materials. Whereas if it is to be given to the school based on its rank or its performance, there might exist a subtle tendency for the school administration to use the grant in improving the school's features rather than the development of the individual pupils. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of providing constructive ideas, may I propose, firstly, that parents and pupils, especially the Malay parents and pupils upon reaching their capacity to withdraw from the scheme, that a small percentage of perhaps 5% to 10% be given to further the cause of community development. The scheme allows parents of pupils below 21 years or the students reaching 21 years themselves to withdraw the balance standing to their credit. The amount donated to certain bodies that cater for educational development may be used to create a larger pool of money to be used as bursaries or financial assistance. These two requirements have increased tremendously as society realises the growing importance of education. This suggestion, if taken up, could lead to two further achievements. One, a society that is conscious of the need to care and share upon a windfall or a gain. And, secondly, it will enlighten the hopes of many who would, under the present pool of resources, have to compete fiercely for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> only a small amount. The 5% or 10%, taken accumulatively, will represent a huge and influential figure to help expedite the academic achievement of those who are deserving. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is to encourage parents to be more involved in the shaping of the school's curriculum. This fund has its primary focus on the school's enrichment programmes which encompass the school's extra-curricular activities. Though I am particularly pleased to note the increasing number of parents who are very concerned with their pupils' academic performance, relatively, there are only a handful of parents who get themselves acquainted with the school's non-classroom programmes. These programmes bear a heavy influence on the moulding of a pupil's overall development and are to be treated with equal importance. With more parents' participation, the choice made by the pupils in schools on the programmes and activities that they should be involved with would be made with more precision and wisdom with a view to optimizing the scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, may I propose that the Fund be used to start certain ECAs that are only evidenced in secondary schools. Perhaps it may be worth considering the introduction of Language Societies and outdoor clubs, like an Adventure Club, in the primary schools. The cost may now be offset by the implementation of this Bill. It may consequently help cultivate interest in organisational work, community service and healthy living in the early days of a pupil. For the Malay pupils, early involvement in such activities would help solve the problems of lack of participation of Malay pupils in association work and voluntarism in secondary school and the days after. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is acknowledged that this scheme is an investment rather than a welfare programme bred by the Government. As such, it does not include the provision of financial assistance and bursaries. In my opinion, as long as the use of the fund could be justified as being proximate to the main objectives of this scheme, then some flexibility should be given. In the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> field of promoting education, the difference between an investment and welfare assistance can be on a very thin and grey line. When this scheme goes into practice, there may arise some confusion and complications as a result of this. It is pointless to provide enrichment programmes to a pupil who can hardly grasp the basic concept of education itself. We must constantly be aware that while the emphasis would rest on the upper rung, those in the lower rung must not be neglected in terms of attention and importance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, may I be enlightened on the mode of the implementation of this scheme? Who would administer the accounts of the pupils? Will it be on the shoulders of the teachers who, at present, are so much occupied with classroom management and more? Or will it be the responsibility of the school administration which is equally occupied with running an increasingly complex institution? Or are there some other devices planned by the Ministry? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposed scheme, viewed on a whole and analyzed objectively, is like an insurance scheme to insure the country and its people for a better future. Nevertheless, the scheme requires further discussion so as to produce a viable scheme and to guarantee its success. I fully believe that this scheme will help to foster a closer and healthier relationship between the parents, the schools and the Ministry. And in such a relationship, none other than the students themselves would stand to benefit and be assured of an easier pursuit towards excellence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate. I would like to rise in support of the Bill. I see that the Bill provides the enhancement of educational potential of all our children in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument by the Member for Hougang that there is a disparity in terms of allocation of resources between ordinary schools and independent schools does not hold, because one has \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to examine whether the schooling children are discriminated based on their income backgrounds. I think that children of working class backgrounds do get access to the system, both the ordinary secondary schools and independent schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the scholarship scheme that is being accorded to independent school children, one has to ask whether children of working class backgrounds do have access to such a scholarship. The scholarship is applicable to children of working class backgrounds as well as other children of better-off backgrounds. Therefore, I see that there is basically no discrimination because access is based on performance and results. And children of all backgrounds have access to this scholarship, be they in independent schools or non-independent schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to say is that, in response to this enhancement of children's education, I hope that we do not forget that there are children who are less endowed. There are children who are in special education and they are our children. I hope that this Education Endowment Scheme could be extended to children who are in our special schools, particularly the disabled children who are now studying in these various special schools. What I would like to ask the Minister is whether the benefits will be extended to this category of children. I feel that they should not be discriminated because they are still our children who are studying in special schools and, to all extent, equal treatment will have to be extended to them. I hope the Minister will be able to look into this matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in August 1991, as the Member for Potong Pasir had mentioned, the PAP contested the General Elections by proposing Edusave as a plan to raise the educational standards of Singaporeans and to enhance our education system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Edusave is one of many programmes that the PAP Government had proposed in past elections. And as far as I can remember, PAP is the only \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> party to have contested the elections on a platform of plans and programmes meant to uplift the people and improve the economy. I cannot remember any other party having done the same. And it came as no surprise that today we heard the representatives of SDP and the Worker's Party opposing this programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I have a point of clarification? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you giving way, Mr Maidin? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> No, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> He is not giving way, Mr Chiam. Please continue. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, what is going to happen now is, and history will record it, that between August 1991 and January 1993, within a period of less than 16 months, a plan that was presented as part of an election campaign is to become a reality. Mr Speaker, we are going to witness how efficient the Government is, how it can implement such a programme within such a short time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something the PAP Government has always been doing and I guess this is making the Members for Potong Pasir and Hougang uneasy. And so, Mr Speaker, they tried to criticise and somehow weaken such a good proposal. But I am saddened and rather concerned because their criticisms are directed at not just a programme of the PAP Government but at something meant for the good of the people of Singapore. I am perplexed because both the Members who have risen earlier have always claimed to be leaders who entered the political arena to improve the lives of Singaporeans and to contribute to their well-being. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, for me in particular, there are two important points about this proposal. Overall, we will be bringing improvements to the education system, to the benefit of Singaporeans. We will be giving everyone the opportunity to enjoy a variety of educational \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> programmes, not all of which are available in every school previously. In this way, children from the less well-to-do families will be able to benefit from such programmes too. The financial boost provided by the Government through this scheme will enable them to grow up in a more comprehensive education system and help make their education more rounded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am confident that further enhancements to our education system will be possible in future with the provisions under this Bill, and I am sure the Ministry will endeavour to make such improvements from time to time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, may I say that when I was a student years back, I too was a member of a photography club in my school. As far as I can remember, the services provided by the school were not free, contrary to what was said. At the same time, coming as I did from a poor family, I did not have the opportunity to benefit from something like the Edusave scheme, because no such scheme existed then. But, in future, maybe from next year onwards, students who come from poor families, who want to take advantage of programmes like the photography club, will be able to do so, because this scheme will be there to help them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What do you wish to clarify? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> May I ask Mr Maidin whether it is true or not that on 21st August 1991, the PAP had already formed the Government and there was no need for the Opposition to give its alternative programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. Is it also not true that the PAP in August last year did not say that the Edusave scheme would only confine itself to providing for extra-curricular activities and enhancement programmes? Is it also not true that the PAP has gone back on its word in regard to the setting up of an Open University? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in fact new in politics. But as far as I know, if a party has no plans, then it is difficult to call itself a political party. Maybe it should call itself a Saturday night party. You do not have a plan and you could enjoy yourself. At the same time, Sir, in my view, it is not fair to say that because the PAP has been in power, all other Opposition parties need not worry about plans. I think that is a less responsible way of approaching politics in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's other question, I think the Minister for Education is more familiar with this subject, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the first time the idea was mooted till now, I think there is some deviation. The original intention was to give $100 to each student. Now it has been shifted to a more scholarly kind of endowment to reward those who can study. The worry here is, like the Medisave scheme, whether a sudden surge in a certain demand will cause a surge in the cost and price that the schools will have to pay. It looks like schools will be the ones to dictate what the students would get. Probably a good compromise will be to also allow a small portion of the money, maybe a quarter, to go to each individual student so that he could also make a decision with the parents to use the money. If for anything, he could accumulate the money for further studies in the later stage of life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly, on the scholarly endowment, it may not be very palatable in the sense that the Education Ministry has been trying very hard through the many systems and schemes, different kinds of schools and giving more budget to the schools to enhance their own programmes. That part of it is beautiful and that should continue. But I think Edusave should be given more to the students themselves, an investment that the Government is willing to put in the students, rather than on the mechanism of education as a total picture. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the budget side, if 4% is not enough, maybe a little bit more in the good years should go straight to helping \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the schools to provide more incentives for running better ECA programmes. But my personal feeling is that disappointment will come when the original intention was to give $100 to each student and then allow him to see where he would like to improve on. Otherwise, if schools run strictly on all ECA programmes, such as ballet and music, do we have the facilities to provide for them? There will be a sudden surge in all these costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all those Members who have spoken in support of the Bill. If I am correct, I think Mr Low also supports the Bill, although he has some queries about certain aspects, especially about the scholarship scheme. Mr Chiam did not say whether he supports the Bill, but he seems a little bit confused about certain aspects of the scheme. Maybe after clarification, he might also support the scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is hard to quarrel with the scheme because, basically, the Government's intention is to put aside some surplus money for educational purposes to benefit many generations of students. So this basic concept of putting aside, initially $1 billion, and building up to $5 billion for the benefit of our children and grandchildren, is something we cannot quarrel with. But, as expected, there will be some disagreement over how to use the money and whether it should be used this way or that way, and who should qualify. I think that is to be expected. Even within a family when they have a budget to renovate the house, everybody should be happy but they will be quarrelling about how to renovate the house. So I think the same problems will apply here. But the basic concept is a sound one and I am sure Members will support it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to deal with the points made by Mr Chiam that the Government has not kept its election promise. That is entirely untrue. In fact, within a short spell of two years, my Ministry has worked extra hard to put the scheme into place. The scheme is basically the same as before. There has \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> been no change, except for the fact that now the Prime Minister has decided to introduce the element of competition. Instead of giving a straight handout from the income of the fund to every pupil, there will now be scholarship schemes, not only for independent schools but also for all schools. So if the child is not so bright and he goes to a neighbourhood school of a lower standard, where the children are not so bright, the top students will also get scholarships. So there will be encouragement of this competition at all levels, and not only in the independent schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the independent schools are more expensive because they are experimenting with smaller class size, new programmes and so on. So the basic principle of the independent schools is that the State pays for the basic amount, as in all schools, and the parents pay for the extra. This extra does cost money. That is why some independent schools, like RI and ACS, are charging $200 per month in school fees. The other range will be $75 in some of the independent girl schools. So the complaint came about: \"Okay, well and good, you have these independent schools trying to innovate, but because of the high fees, you are preventing some parents from sending their children to these schools\". Therefore, the Government felt that it should provide scholarship schemes to enable bright children to compete for places in those schools. Through this scholarship scheme, the children will now be able to enrol in all these independent schools, depending on their own choice, so long as they are able to compete and win places in those schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the school fees are higher in the independent schools, therefore, we have to provide scholarships to cater for the additional fees. Therefore, the quantum has to be bigger. It has to be for the full four years; otherwise if a poor student comes in and then after one year he has no scholarship, he may have to leave. That is the reason why the scholarships for independent schools are based on the PSLE results and valid \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for the full four years. But, in addition, there will be scholarships for the other students who did not make it in the PSLE. So long as they come within the top 5% of the students in the school results of those independent schools, they will also qualify for scholarships on a year-by-year basis, if they have not already got the scholarship at the PSLE entry point. I think that covers mainly the points raised by Mr Low. The intention is not just to focus attention on the top 25% who enrol in independent schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I clarify with the Minister, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I think he can clarify later, because we are running short of time. It is rather late anyway. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying that the intention is, in fact, to try and let the schools innovate so that they will improve on the quality. In addition to independent schools, we are now contemplating to set up some autonomous schools where the fees will be kept lower so that bright children can not only apply for the independent schools, but also to other good schools. You may have noticed from the ranking of schools that, in fact, the independent schools are not all top schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia and Mr Chiam said we made some changes to the Edusave scheme. That is true. Firstly, we introduce scholarships to enhance the competitive element. Secondly, we allow block grants to schools. There, we have not really departed from the principle. The point is that the money from the pupils is sometimes best channelled en bloc to the schools as they are best able to know what scheme to meet the needs of the students. You can either do it on an individual basis, every pupil applying on his own, which is quite costly administratively. Or else, we do it en bloc. So the idea is for the benefit of all the pupils in the schools, we will yearly channel a sum of money to the schools. The sum will average $100,000 per secondary school. But the quantum per school would depend on the enrolment. So they will get the same quantum per capita. This is the point Mr Umar raised. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate that with all these schemes, for the first year of operation, the sum that will go to the individual pupil's account will be in the region of about $50 per year. This is somewhat lower than the original $100. But the sum will be increased over the years, as we put in more money into the fund so that eventually when we reach the $5 billion target and if you assume 5% interest earnings per year, then the sum could well approach $500 per child per year. Over a 10-year period, that is not an insignificant sum of $5,000 per pupil. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention is for this sum to be used for the benefit of the pupils to enhance their education. It is not for the schools to start raising fees and so on, so that what we give out with one hand we take back with the other hand. That is not the intention. The Government is not short of money for education. We are spending 4%. If need be, we will spend more money. But there is this extra sum of money that can be used for enhancement programmes so that the schools can design programmes to meet the needs of the pupils, and the parents can have a choice. Through the pupils' fund, they will have a say whether the fund would be used for a particular activity. They themselves will have to approve that activity. So there is a choice there. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own approach to this is a cautious one. On the one hand, we want to improve the education of our children. So we want to have worthwhile programmes, we want to have value for money. We do not just want to spend the money on any spurious programme. That is why we insist that the programme must be school-based and school-controlled. Otherwise the private sector could come out with all kinds of schemes and very soon the money will be gone. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would rather that we keep the money in an account and use it carefully, and if there is no good scheme, maybe eventually the money could be transferred to CPF as a saving or for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> other uses, or it could be used later on to pay for university fees. So I would rather take a conservative approach and keep the money there and use it when necessary. The intention is not to benefit the teachers through higher pay and so on. That is not the intention. The intention is for the schools to come out with programmes where they can enhance the learning of the children. They might, for example, hire additional specialists for music, they might bring their children to excursions to see various museums and pay for their museum admission charges and so on. The money should not be used to build facilities or for school building projects. It should not be used, for example, to pay the existing teachers, who are already paid. The intention is for additional programmes, additional improvements, on a flexible basis, on a school-by-school, and with parental choice, basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just briefly on the Open University. The Government has not abandoned the plan to implement the Open University. It has merely decided on changing the vehicle for implementation. The Government is fully behind the Open University programme. It is in fact providing a big sum of $38 million to start off the programme. This is a point that has to be corrected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just briefly touch on some of the points raised by the other Members. Mr Peh asked that we control the scheme so that it will not be abused. I agree with him fully, and I have explained this point. He asked whether we should have higher fines than those stipulated in the Act. I do not think so at this point. But if need be, we can always raise them later. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked whether we are considering grants for primary schools. The answer is not yet. But we will observe how the scheme works for secondary schools and, depending on the availability of funds, we will consider primary schools at the next stage. But I take his point that we should try and do this as soon as possible. He asked why we limit this to three children. I have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> already explained. It has to be consistent with the population policy. The sum of money may be insignificant to rich parents, but to poor parents it may be attractive, and we do not want to give them the wrong signal. So, unfortunately, we do have to draw a line somewhere, and that is at the third child. In fact, for procreation, there are already various tax incentives to encourage those who can afford to have more children. Those who cannot afford, they really should confine themselves to three or less children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Umar asked for the basis of grant to schools. It is on a per capita basis. I think that is fair because the money is basically to benefit the children and we are really taking part of the money from the Edusave pupils accounts, grouping it together, and giving it to the schools. So the bigger the enrolment, the more the money. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether some of the contributions could be donated to community organisations after the member has reached 21 years of age. My answer is that there is no plan for that. I think the community-based organisations already have sufficient funds at their disposal through the CPF scheme where they check-off from the salaries of the workers who do not object to doing it or who have not opted out. So with that and the dollar-for-dollar matching from Government, I think there is enough money. Really, the Edusave scheme is for the benefit of the pupils. If they do not require the money, they should really donate to schools and benefit the other students. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administratively, I would like to keep this scheme as simple as possible. Because one of the drawbacks is that if you have parental choice, and the sum is initially not big, it could become very expensive to administer. So we should try and control it. One way, for example, would be to allow the Edusave funds to be used to pay for the second tier miscellaneous fees. The Edusave fund cannot be used for the basic school fees and miscellaneous fees which come to about $12 per month. But some schools \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are allowed to increase and have decided to increase their miscellaneous fees by 30%, which is another $2 per month. This money can be used for that purpose. It can also be used to pay the school fees of independent schools above the basic level of $12 per month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo made the point that there is free competition to enter the schools. The point is valid. He asked whether we would allow this to be given to special education schools. Unfortunately, the answer has to be no, because the scheme is meant to improve our education in schools, meaning Government schools, Government-aided schools and independent schools. For the special education schools, we have a separate scheme where the Ministry does provide grants up to twice the per capita cost of primary schools. If there is need for more money, we can consider it. But I think we should treat it separately from the Edusave scheme. I am in full agreement with him that we do the best we can for these children. But I think Edusave is somewhat different. We are trying to invest and improve on the quality of our schools. So we have to draw a line at our schools and not include other schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered most of the points. If I have missed anything out, please let me know. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify. Under clause 6(1)(c), \"for the provision of contributions to the Edusave Pupils Fund\", will contributions be made now to each pupil or a pupil can only get contributions through the provision of scholarships under clause 6(1)(b)? Because you have defrayment of payment out of the student's account through extra-curricular activity. Where does the money come from if there is no payment out under clause 6(1)(d)? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> For the first year of operation next year, Parliament has already made special provision. Because there is no Edusave money yet, there is no earning of income. There is a special vote already approved by Parliament in the budget amounting to $40 million \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which will be the initial income, as it were, for the Fund over and above the $1 billion. So the initial sum of money going to the Edusave Fund from January next year will be the $1 billion capital plus $40 million, which is deemed to be income for the Fund, and that Fund will be used in the following ways. To provide for grants to the secondary schools, this will amount to about $13 million, because there are about 130 secondary schools, and on average, it is $100,000 per school. Then there will be another roughly $1.4 million for the Edusave scholarships for independent schools. In fact, the number is probably smaller because the fees are less than the amount used for this estimation. The Edusave scholarships for secondary schools will get another $1.6 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the $40 million, you deduct the $13 million, and you deduct $3 million for scholarships, there is still quite a lot of money left. Of course, you have to pay for the initial computerisation and administrative costs. But we estimate that in year one alone, we will be able to contribute to each pupil's account somewhere in the region of about $40 to $50. This is less than the original $100 because of the new schemes that I have mentioned. But the intention is that once we reach $5 billion, then the sum in the pupils' accounts will be much larger. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. Does the Minister agree that, from the criteria of award for scholarships, it appears that the award is not based on effort and result of the PSLE, but rather on the choice of students who want to be admitted to independent schools or other schools, because of the difference in amount of the scholarships? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> That is not quite true. The children will have to submit their choice before the PSLE. So those who opt for the independent schools, of course, will be considered. But, in addition, the top students will again be given an option after the results are out, whether they want to opt for any particular independent school. We then \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> rank all the applicants, those who applied before as well as those who qualify based on their results, by order of merit, and the top 25% will be given scholarships, and they can choose whatever school they want to go - RI, ACS, or any other school. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. If that is the system, does the Minister agree that the top 25% of the students will opt for independent schools rather than other schools? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I think it is not always true. It is true that most of the top students do tend to opt for certain schools. But there are other students who prefer, for example, Christian schools for various reasons. SJI is one example. They also have this feeder school arrangement. But the main point is that there is this free competition to enter into the top schools. The independent schools are among the best schools in Singapore. So there is free competition by all, regardless of family background, based on their PSLE results, to get scholarships to go into those schools. And I suspect most of the bright students will tend to orientate towards certain schools. There will not be an even spread of scholars across all the independent schools. In addition, there will be other schemes. There will be the scholarship scheme for all the other secondary schools. And we are also thinking of having autonomous schools to rival the independent schools, but charging lower fees. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> My question is whether the top 25% of PSLE students would be encouraged, because of the scheme, to opt for independent schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> It is the top 25% of those who apply for independent schools, not the top 25% of all the PSLE students. The good schools tend to attract better students. As you can see from the ranking of schools, there is already, with or without a scholarship, a certain orientation towards certain schools. But the school results are not everything. Parents and children do choose schools for various reasons, maybe old boys' links, maybe because \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> they prefer the flavour of the school. So it is not a clear-cut orientation. The parents should really choose the schools that fit their children. If you look at the ranking of schools, you will find that the good schools are those that take in children with good results. The schools that have really done a lot for their pupils are those that add value, ie, they take in average children and produce good results. So we should judge schools not purely from the academic results, which depend to a great extent on what they take in, but also on the all-round development of their pupils. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. Would the Minister say how much it will allocate to individual Edusave account holders? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already explained this. First year, we expect maybe $40 to $50 per account. This depends on detailed calculations. And later on, it depends on how much we can put aside, and if Parliament approves the amount. And eventually when it is $5 billion, at 5% interest per year, that is $250 million. After you minus the amounts for various scholarship and grant schemes, which are not very much relatively, most of the balance will go into the pupils' accounts. If it is $250 million divided by 400,000 qualifying pupils, it is about $500-$600 per pupil. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Yock Suan]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this sitting would have ended a few minutes earlier if Members had listened carefully to what the Minister has said, and they need not have to ask questions for which answers had already been given. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Half-past Five o'clock pm\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   to a date to be fixed.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>Appendix I</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>USE OF BLOCK 143, POTONG PASIR AVENUE 2, #01-214</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. \n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for National Development why he allows part of the premises of the People's Action Party Community Foundation Education Centre at Block 143, Potong Pasir Avenue 2 to be used (i) as a branch office of the PAP; (ii) to hold Meet-the-People sessions; and (iii) as an election headquarters of the PAP candidate in 1991. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the void deck at Block 143 Potong Pasir Ave 2, #01-214 has been let to the PAP Community Foundation by HDB since 1st July 1987 for use as an Education Centre.

Within these guidelines, the Foundation can decide which other organisations or individuals can be allowed to sub-let or use the premises, and the type of activities that can be held. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must stress that allowing the Foundation to sub-let its premises is not in any way unusual. HDB's tenancy agreements for shops, offices, and other commercial premises, for example, also allow sub-letting.
