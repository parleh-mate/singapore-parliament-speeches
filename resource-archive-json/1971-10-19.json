As the  present  number  of\r\n\r\napplicants for Telex machines who are on the  waiting\r\n\r\nlist  is  249, subject to the above suppliers meeting\r\n\r\ntheir  delivery dates, we should be able  to  satisfy\r\n\r\nthe  present demand for Telex machines in full by the\r\n\r\nmiddle of next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, 400 lines of the 1,200-line National\r\n\r\nAutomatic Telex Exchange, costing $1.96 million, will\r\n\r\nbe  commissioned into operation this month (October).\r\n\r\nThe  full  capacity of this exchange will be realised\r\n\r\nby the middle of next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a 150-channel automatic International Telex\r\n\r\nExchange has been ordered at a cost of $640,000,  and\r\n\r\nshould be operational early in 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PORT OF SINGAPORE AUTHORITY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Introduction of four-shift system)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The\r\n\r\ndisbursement  of  Fitrah is governed  by  Muslim  law\r\n\r\nwhich  specifically provides for the  definition  and\r\n\r\nqualification  for  the Fakirs and  the  Miskins  who\r\n\r\ngenerally  may  be said to be the deserving  and  the\r\n\r\nvery   deserving   of  the  Muslims  for   collective\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance by Muslims as a  whole  towards\r\n\r\nthe  end of Ramadan, the month of the fast. The basis\r\n\r\nfor  this  in Singapore is determined by  the  Majlis\r\n\r\nUgama   Islam  who  are  also  responsible  for   the\r\n\r\ncollection  and  distribution of Fitrah.  The  Majlis\r\n\r\nUgama  Islam  applies a means test on applicants  who\r\n\r\nclaim  to  be  either  Fakir  or  Miskin.  They   are\r\n\r\nregistered  yearly  with  details  of  their  incomes\r\n\r\nbefore payments are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970, $73,912 was paid out from the Fitrah\r\n\r\nAccount  to  18,478 Muslims classified  as  Fakir  or\r\n\r\nMiskin.  They  were  each  given  $4.00.  It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to ascertain how many of the 18,478  Muslims\r\n\r\nwho  are  classified  in this category  are  also  on\r\n\r\npublic assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970 also, a total of 649 Muslims were reported\r\n\r\nby  the  Amils as having defaulted in the payment  of\r\n\r\nFitrah. Letters were sent out requesting them to call\r\n\r\nfor an interview. Investigation revealed that in most\r\n\r\ncases  failure  to  pay  was due  to  poor  financial\r\n\r\ncircumstances. A few claimed preference to pay during\r\n\r\nthe  last three days of Ramadan but fell ill and were\r\n\r\naccordingly  unable  to comply  with  the  law;  some\r\n\r\nremoved  to  new  addresses and  inquiries  with  the\r\n\r\nNational Registration Office confirmed they  had  not\r\n\r\nreported  changes  of addresses.  Yet  a  few  others\r\n\r\nturned up later to make late payments. The figure  of\r\n\r\n649  represents only a small fraction  of  defaulters\r\n\r\nthe  Majlis  Ugama  Islam have  managed  to  act  on.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Majlis  are now trying  to  compile  a\r\n\r\nregister  of Muslims in Singapore, the completion  of\r\n\r\nwhich would assist them greatly in tracking those who\r\n\r\nhave failed to make Fitrah payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LAND ACQUISITION PLANS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FOR EASTERN SIDE OF</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>JALAN EUNOS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Mohd.

The\r\n\r\neffects .are physically and mentally destructive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any\r\n\r\ndrug,  including ganja and MX pills, is bad. Although\r\n\r\nthese  two  drugs  may not create the  same  physical\r\n\r\ndependence  as  morphine or  heroin,  they  create  a\r\n\r\npsychological dependence. This occurs in persons with\r\n\r\ninadequate  personalities,  making  them  excessively\r\n\r\nreliant  on other people, or dependent on the  drugs.\r\n\r\nThe  taking  of ganja and MX pills can  lead  to  the\r\n\r\ntaking of the more dangerous drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ganja smoking has a longer history. Not much medical\r\n\r\nresearch  has gone into it. Those that have  come  to\r\n\r\nour  attention have been those who have been arrested\r\n\r\nor  are  in custody. For those persons in prison,  an\r\n\r\nattempt is made to get them to rid themselves of  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  fall back on smoking ganja. So far we  have\r\n\r\nadmitted  17  ganja addicts to the St. John's  Island\r\n\r\ntreatment centre. For the ganja addict, treatment  is\r\n\r\nrelatively  simple.

It may be  taken\r\n\r\nout of curiosity or because it has got a potentiating\r\n\r\neffect  not  known  pharmaceutically.  Whatever   the\r\n\r\nreason,  its  use without a doctor's  control  causes\r\n\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few cases that have been brought to the\r\n\r\nattention of the clinicians have been cases of  over-dosage.

It is applicable to goods entering  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  which are already subject  to  import\r\n\r\nduty.  Raw  materials and primary produce which  were\r\n\r\nnot then dutiable' and products which were subject to\r\n\r\nimport  quotas, such as petroleum and cotton  textile\r\n\r\ngoods,  are  exempt from the surcharge. In  addition,\r\n\r\nfor  certain  products assembled from American  parts\r\n\r\nand  components, both import duty and  the  surcharge\r\n\r\nare  levied  only  on  the  value  added,  i.e.,  the\r\n\r\ndifference'  between the f.o.b price  (Singapore)  of\r\n\r\nthe  product and the cost of the American  parts  and\r\n\r\ncomponents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic exports of Singapore to' the U.S.A.\r\n\r\nwere  $246 million in 1970 and about $148 million  in\r\n\r\nthe  first half of 1971. Of these, the most important\r\n\r\nitems  are  electronic and electrical products  which\r\n\r\naccount for nearly 50 per cent; textile and garments,\r\n\r\n20  per cent;, processed rubber, 20 per cent in 1970,\r\n\r\n12  per  cent  in  1971; timber  products,  including\r\n\r\nplywood  and veneer, 6 per cent; petroleum  products,\r\n\r\n1.5  per  cent in 1970, 7 per cent in 1971;  pleasure\r\n\r\ncraft, 2 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the main Singapore-made exports. As far as\r\n\r\nthe electronic and electrical products are concerned,\r\n\r\nthe surcharge falls on the value added. As much of it\r\n\r\nis  assembled  from  U.S, parts and  components,  the\r\n\r\neffective rate of the surcharge is probably less than\r\n\r\n5 per cent. Furthermore, most of these' companies are\r\n\r\nselling  to  their  parent companies  in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  and  there has been no drop in  demand.  With\r\n\r\nregard  to  textiles and garments, those from  cotton\r\n\r\nare  subject to quota and therefore exempt  from  the\r\n\r\nsurcharge. Our export of synthetic textile  products.\r\n\r\nto  the United States is quite small and, from recent\r\n\r\npress  reports,  would  also, be  exempt.  Petroleum\r\n\r\nproducts and crumb rubber are not dutiable and so not\r\n\r\nsubject to the surcharge. Plywood and veneer do  have\r\n\r\nto pay duty, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  demand depends on construction activity  in  the\r\n\r\nU.S. If the United States economic measures result in\r\n\r\nstimulating  construction  activity,  they  will   be\r\n\r\nimporting more plywood and veneer and their importers\r\n\r\nmay have to absorb part of the surcharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, therefore, the surcharge has not\r\n\r\naffected us very much. In some instances, we may have\r\n\r\na     temporary    advantage.    Certain    equipment\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  such as household  appliances  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  have  been facing severe  competition\r\n\r\nfrom  other industrialised countries. To improve  the\r\n\r\ncompetitive  position of their products made  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited States, they have to import certain parts  and\r\n\r\ncomponents  from  us.  With the surcharge,  they  may\r\n\r\nincrease  sales  which  would thus  lead  to  greater\r\n\r\ndemand  for  our parts and components. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  a  few specific companies here making finished\r\n\r\nproducts  such as pleasure craft which  are  dutiable\r\n\r\nmay  have  to face some temporary difficu1tes.  They\r\n\r\nshould,  however,  be  able  to  make  the  necessary\r\n\r\nadjustments with a little bit of belt-tightening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, in the short term, we are not seriously\r\n\r\naffected, we nevertheless hope that the problem  will\r\n\r\nbe settled quickly. If it is prolonged, the surcharge\r\n\r\nwould  distort  international trade  since  the  more\r\n\r\nimportant   question   of   international    currency\r\n\r\nadjustments  is  linked to the  import  surcharge.  A\r\n\r\nshrinkage  of overall world trade would have  adverse\r\n\r\nrepercussions  for  us.

Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a White Paper on\r\n\r\nthe  Report  of  the Electoral Boundaries  Delineation\r\n\r\nCommittee has been presented to Parliament as  Command\r\n\r\n21  of 1971. The Government has decided to accept  all\r\n\r\nthe recommendations with regard to the sub-division of\r\n\r\n11  large constituencies and the creation of seven new\r\n\r\nconstituencies with consequential adjustments to eight\r\n\r\nconstituencies. The enlargement of six constituencies,\r\n\r\noutside   the   central  areas  of  the  city,   whose\r\n\r\nelectorates  are  lower  than  12,800  has  also  been\r\n\r\naccepted.    The   acceptance   of   the   Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendation will increase the number  of  electoral\r\n\r\ndivisions from 58 to 65.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Elections Act (Chapter 50) provides\r\n\r\nthat  each electoral division shall return one  Member\r\n\r\nto  serve in Parliament. The Constitution of Singapore\r\n\r\nstipulates a Parliamentary membership of 51  until  it\r\n\r\nis   varied   by   law.   In  this   connection,   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Membership Act, 1967, was introduced  in\r\n\r\nParliament in that year to increase the membership  to\r\n\r\n58.  Consequent  to  the  increase  of  the  electoral\r\n\r\ndivisions to 65, it is necessary again to introduce  a\r\n\r\nBill,  entitled  the  Parliamentary  Membership  Bill,\r\n\r\n1971, at the present sitting of Parliament to increase\r\n\r\nthe  number  of electoral members to Parliament  above\r\n\r\nthe  present total membership. This increase will come\r\n\r\ninto  effect  as  from  the  next  general  elections.\r\n\r\nHowever,   for  the  purposes  of  the  next   general\r\n\r\nelections,  it  is  necessary  to  publish  a  Gazette\r\n\r\nNotification  under  section 8  of  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nElections  Act (Chapter 50) specifying the  names  and\r\n\r\nboundaries of the 65 revised registers of electors under\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsection  10  of the same Act. The  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nMembership Bill, 1971, will enable these steps to  be\r\n\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another Bill, entitled the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nElections  (Amendment) Bill, will also be  introduced\r\n\r\nat  the present sitting of Parliament. This Bill will\r\n\r\namend the Parliamentary Elections Act (Chapter 50) to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the preparation of fresh  registers  of\r\n\r\nelectors  from  the  registers  maintained   by   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of National Registration and to  include\r\n\r\nin  such  registers the names of all entitled persons\r\n\r\nwho  were, on the 1st day of July, 1971, citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and to whom identity cards were issued. The\r\n\r\npresent  registers of electors were reviewed in  1967\r\n\r\nand  since  then  there has been  an  annual  average\r\n\r\nincrease  of  36,000 electors. By 1st  February  next\r\n\r\nyear, the number of electors is expected to be in the\r\n\r\nregion of 951,751. However, the rapid development  of\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board estates has culminated\r\n\r\nin  uneven  distributions of electors, especially  in\r\n\r\nthe electoral division of Toa Payoh which is expected\r\n\r\nby  1972  to have about 70,000 electors, whereas  the\r\n\r\naverage number of electors per electoral division  is\r\n\r\n16,000.  In  this  context, the  fresh  registers  of\r\n\r\nelectors  prepared according to the revised electoral\r\n\r\nboundaries  will  contain more even distributions  of\r\n\r\nelectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill\r\n\r\nhas  become  law,  a  Gazette  Notification  will  be\r\n\r\npublished to specify the names and boundaries of  the\r\n\r\n65 revised electoral divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POLICE JUNIOR OFFICERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(New structure and salary scales)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.27p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been some\r\n\r\nspeculation about revision of salaries and terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of service for the Police Junior  Officers\r\n\r\narising from the Lee Soo Ann\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReport.

It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to accept the conversions recommended by the\r\n\r\nLee   Soo   Ann   Committee,  partly  because   those\r\n\r\nconversions  were  based on the assumption  that  all\r\n\r\nallowances  will be abolished. The Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  has, however, made strong representation  to\r\n\r\nretain some of these allowances and convert others to\r\n\r\nincremental  credits. My Ministry has accepted  this.\r\n\r\nHence,   adjustments   to  the  salary   conversions'\r\n\r\nproposed by the Report will be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending implementation of the new salary scales on\r\n\r\n1st  April next year and resolution of the method  of\r\n\r\nconversion between the Ministries of Home Affairs and\r\n\r\nFinance,  it has been decided that the Police  Junior\r\n\r\nOfficers will be given an interim increase. From next\r\n\r\nmonth,  that is, from the 1st of November, an interim\r\n\r\nallowance  of  10  per  cent of their  present  total\r\n\r\nemoluments,  excluding  housing  and  public  utility\r\n\r\nallowances,  will  be  paid  to  all  serving  Junior\r\n\r\nOfficers on their present salaries. This means  a  10\r\n\r\nper  cent  increase  in  take-home  pay,  salary  and\r\n\r\nspecial  post and education allowances. This  interim\r\n\r\n10  per  cent increase will be taken account of  when\r\n\r\nconverting these officers to the new salary scales on\r\n\r\n1st April next year. Payment of this interim increase\r\n\r\nis  expected  to cost Government about $2  million  a\r\n\r\nyear  on  the  basis of the present strength  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approval in principle of the new salary scales\r\n\r\nwill  enable the Ministry of Home Affairs to  attract\r\n\r\neven  better  qualified  Police  Junior  Officers  in\r\n\r\nfuture  recruitment  exercises, especially  now  that\r\n\r\nfrom  the  next intake of recruits payment for  board\r\n\r\nand  lodging  will be waived during their  period  of\r\n\r\ntraining  at  the  Police Academy.

Since  then, we have progressed  from  a\r\n\r\ncolony depending principally upon entrepot trade  for\r\n\r\nour  livelihood to a sovereign and independent nation\r\n\r\nwith  industrial activities assuming an  increasingly\r\n\r\ndominant role in our national economy In striving for\r\n\r\nrapid  industrialisation, we  have  encountered  many\r\n\r\nproblems, including that of a shortage of skilled and\r\n\r\nsemi-skilled labour, the need to upgrade  the  skills\r\n\r\nof  our  workers as well as introducing them  to  new\r\n\r\nskills  to  meet  the  demands  of  higher  and  more\r\n\r\nsophisticated  technology.  We  are,   however,   not\r\n\r\ndeterred  by  the  immensity of the problem.  On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  we  have taken various concrete  steps  to\r\n\r\novercome  it. On a short-term basis, we have embarked\r\n\r\nupon crash training programmes as well as adopting  a\r\n\r\nmore  liberal immigration policy to attract the entry\r\n\r\nof  foreign skilled labour into Singapore. As a long-term  measure,  we have restructured our  educational\r\n\r\nsystem   so  as  to  give  technical  and  vocational\r\n\r\neducation   the   proper  emphasis  and   recognition\r\n\r\ndemanded  by  our  current  industrial  and  economic\r\n\r\npolicies. We firmly believe that ultimately  we  must\r\n\r\nbe in a position to supply the skills required by our\r\n\r\nown  industries  instead of having to depend  largely\r\n\r\nupon immigrant skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it grieves me to say that, despite\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  skilled labour is one  of  our  most\r\n\r\nimportant assets, insufficient efforts have been made\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that there is no unnecessary  wastage  of\r\n\r\nlabour   through   accidents.   This   careless   and\r\n\r\nirresponsible  attitude is reflected  in  the  upward\r\n\r\ntrend   in   industrial   accidents.   According   to\r\n\r\nstatistics compiled by my Ministry, there were  9,682\r\n\r\naccidents  reported under the Workmen's  Compensation\r\n\r\nOrdinance  for the year 1970 as compared  with  8,714\r\n\r\nfor  1969, that is, an increase of 11 per  cent.  Of\r\n\r\nthese,  159 were fatal and 866 resulted in  permanent\r\n\r\ndisablement  as  against  132  fatal  cases  and  731\r\n\r\npermanent disablement cases for 1969. As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  matter  of  fact,  the total number  of  accidents\r\n\r\nreported  under the Workmen's Compensation  Ordinance\r\n\r\nhas been steadily increasing from 7,850 cases in 1964\r\n\r\nto  9,682 for last year. In 1970, a total of  302,800\r\n\r\nman-days were lost in factories alone as a result  of\r\n\r\naccidents  compared with 202,876  man-days  lost  for\r\n\r\n1969.  In terms of workmen's compensation, the amount\r\n\r\npaid  in  1970 was $1,611,504, which is approximately\r\n\r\nthree times the figure for 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, monetary compensation paid out to\r\n\r\nworkers or their immediate families is only a part of\r\n\r\nthe  cost  to  the country arising out of  accidents.\r\n\r\nThere are other costs involved, such as cost of wages\r\n\r\npaid  for  working time lost, medical costs borne  by\r\n\r\nthe employers and the Government, cost of `damage  to\r\n\r\nthe  premises or machines in the case of fire,  costs\r\n\r\nof  education  and vocational or industrial  training\r\n\r\nwhich  could  amount to several millions of  dollars.\r\n\r\nBased  on the 1969 rates, it has been estimated  that\r\n\r\nthe  financial  loss  to the industrial  economy  was\r\n\r\nalmost $23 million in that year. It can thus be  seen\r\n\r\nthat,  apart  from  the  sufferings  of  the  persons\r\n\r\nconcerned as well as the anxiety and hardship  caused\r\n\r\nto  members of their immediate family, relatives  and\r\n\r\nfriends,  industrial  accidents  are  costly  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, no responsible government can afford to\r\n\r\nsit  tight  and  watch  the situation  deteriorating.\r\n\r\nAlthough we cannot completely prevent accidents  from\r\n\r\nhappening, it is possible, through education  of  the\r\n\r\nemployers   and   employees,  coupled   with   strict\r\n\r\nenforcement  of minimum safety measures and  enhanced\r\n\r\nrates of compensation, to arrest the upward trend  of\r\n\r\nindustrial accidents. The recent promulgation of  the\r\n\r\nBuilding   Operations   and  Works   of   Engineering\r\n\r\nConstruction Regulations, 1971, is the first of  many\r\n\r\nsuch  safety regulations to be introduced to  provide\r\n\r\nsafety   guidelines  to  employers   and   employees.\r\n\r\nExtensive  amendments to the Factories Act are  being\r\n\r\ndrafted   to   provide  for  a  higher  standard   of\r\n\r\nindustrial health and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsafety   and  to  give  more  teeth  to  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate. The Workmen's Compensation  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill will have the effect of compelling the employers\r\n\r\nto pay more attention to the safety of their workers,\r\n\r\nwhile at the same time providing a greater amount  of\r\n\r\ncompensation  to  alleviate the sufferings  of  those\r\n\r\nunfortunate victims and their immediate families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main provisions of this amendment Bill are\r\n\r\ndetailed in the Explanatory Statement to the Bill.  I\r\n\r\nwould like, however, to draw attention to some of the\r\n\r\nmore important changes. Firstly, clause 2 of the Bill\r\n\r\nseeks  to  amend  the proviso to  subsection  (1)  of\r\n\r\nsection 2 of the Ordinance and to extend the scope of\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance to cover non-manual workers who earn up\r\n\r\nto  $750  per  month  as against $400  per  month  at\r\n\r\npresent.  This is a logical sequel to the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct,  1968,  which covers all employees,  other  than\r\n\r\nthose  belonging to certain excepted categories,  who\r\n\r\nare earning less than $750 per month. Clause 2 of the\r\n\r\nBill   will  also  bring  all  non-manual  Government\r\n\r\nemployees earning less than $750 per month within the\r\n\r\nambit  of  the Ordinance, many of them for the  first\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the most important amendment to the\r\n\r\nOrdinance   relates  to  the  quantum  of   workmen's\r\n\r\ncompensation.  I  would  like  to  stress  that   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance is an essential piece of legislation  which\r\n\r\nassures  the workers that, in the event of  accidents\r\n\r\narising  out of or in the course of employment,  they\r\n\r\nor  members  of  their families would be  compensated\r\n\r\nfinancially. The compensation payable is  related  to\r\n\r\nthe  earning  capacity of the person  concerned.  The\r\n\r\ncompensation payable under the existing Ordinance has\r\n\r\nbecome  inadequate. When it was fixed  in  1955,  the\r\n\r\naverage monthly wage of a workman 18 years of age and\r\n\r\nabove  was $160 as compared with $197 for July  1970.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  average wage rate has  increased,  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  compensation  payable has  remained  static.\r\n\r\nBesides,  the  purchasing power  of  the  dollar  has\r\n\r\ndecreased to some extent during this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperiod.  In view of this, clause 6 of the  Bill  will\r\n\r\nincrease  the  maximum compensation prescribed  under\r\n\r\nsection  8  of  the  Ordinance to three  times  their\r\n\r\npresent amounts, that is, from $7,200 to $21,600  for\r\n\r\nfatal   cases,  from  $9,600  to  $28,800  in   cases\r\n\r\nresulting in permanent total incapacity, and from $65\r\n\r\nto  $195  for  every  15 days in cases  resulting  in\r\n\r\ntemporary  incapacity. In order that the  workmen  or\r\n\r\ntheir   dependants  will  in  fact  obtain  increased\r\n\r\ncompensation,  the multiplying factors for  computing\r\n\r\ncompensation  have  also  been  raised  considerably.\r\n\r\nMoreover, provision is made to ensure that  in  fatal\r\n\r\ncases,  the  minimum  amount of compensation  payable\r\n\r\nshall not be less than the present maximum of $7,200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the earnings of a workman cannot be\r\n\r\ndetermined, the minimum wages are fixed by section  9\r\n\r\nof  the  Ordinance for the purpose of  computing  the\r\n\r\namount   of  compensation.  Clause  7  of  the   Bill\r\n\r\nincreases these minimum wages from $80 to $120 if the\r\n\r\nworkman  is  18 years of age and above, from  $65  to\r\n\r\n$105  where  he is 16 years and above  but  below  18\r\n\r\nyears  of age, and from $45 to $90 where he is  below\r\n\r\n16  years  of  age.  This amendment will,  therefore,\r\n\r\nincrease  the  quantum  of compensation  due  to  any\r\n\r\nworkman so affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, to ensure that the interests of `the workers\r\n\r\nare  adequately covered and protected, subsection (1)\r\n\r\nof  section 26 `of the Ordinance is being amended  by\r\n\r\nclause  15  of  the  Bill to provide  for  compulsory\r\n\r\ninsurance against the employer's liability under this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.

In this connection, medical boards and\r\n\r\npanels  will  be  established  to  determine  matters\r\n\r\nrelating to medical evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in drafting the Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation   (Amendment)   Bill,   we   have   also\r\n\r\nconsidered  the views and comments of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nEmployers  Federation,  the  National  Trades   Union\r\n\r\nCongress, the General Insurance Association  as  well\r\n\r\nas  those expressed by Members earlier in this House.\r\n\r\nEmployers will, as a result, be required to take  out\r\n\r\ncompulsory  insurance at a higher  premium.  However,\r\n\r\ninsurance companies will, no doubt, offer rebates for\r\n\r\nno accidents or low-accident records and this will be\r\n\r\nan incentive to management to provide a healthier and\r\n\r\nsafer working environment for their employees. Hence,\r\n\r\nthe  additional premium can be offset in the long run\r\n\r\nagainst  less  accidents,  better  productivity   and\r\n\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment Bill is only one of a\r\n\r\nseries   of  legislation  to  encourage  more  safety\r\n\r\nconsciousness among employers and employees. However,\r\n\r\nthese legislative measures in themselves will not  be\r\n\r\ncompletely effective in reducing industrial accidents\r\n\r\nif  the  employers  and employees do  not  co-operate\r\n\r\nwhole   -heartedly.  Hitherto,  most  employers   and\r\n\r\nemployees  have paid scant regard to the  safety  and\r\n\r\nwell-being  of  labour. In their desire  to  maximise\r\n\r\nprofits,  employers  tend  to  neglect  the  need  to\r\n\r\nprovide the minimum requirements for safety of  their\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome  unions themselves appear to be preoccupied with\r\n\r\nbargaining  for  more  dollars  and  cents   to   the\r\n\r\nexclusion  of  safeguarding the lives  and  limbs  of\r\n\r\ntheir  members.  Even  in  the  odd  instances  where\r\n\r\nemployers  had provided helmets and safety  belts  in\r\n\r\nconstruction  projects and factories,  it  was  found\r\n\r\nthat  the  workers were not willing to  make  use  of\r\n\r\nthem, In our urgent drive to industrialise rapidly to\r\n\r\nprovide  jobs  for  the unemployed whose  number  was\r\n\r\naugmented by those retrenched from the British bases,\r\n\r\nand, in the long run, to build up a strong and viable\r\n\r\neconomy  capable  of self-sustaining  growth  thereby\r\n\r\nensuring  a rising standard of living, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  had  to be content with what rudimentary devices\r\n\r\nthe employers are prepared to install.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be said that some loss in human assets is\r\n\r\ninevitable     irs    the    present     stage     of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.

In  so  far  as  it  confers\r\n\r\nincreased  benefits  on workers  who  may  have  been\r\n\r\nincapacitated in one way or another as  a  result  of\r\n\r\naccidents  arising out of or in the course  of  their\r\n\r\nemployment,  the  provisions  of  the  Bill  are,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  to  be welcomed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the amendments\r\n\r\nto the Workmen's Compensation Act as proposed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  Bill can be divided into  three  main\r\n\r\ncategories\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Raising of the salary ceiling for non-manual\r\n\r\nworkers to come within the ambit of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Tripling the maximum amount of compensation\r\n\r\npayable under the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Compulsory insurance by employers against\r\n\r\nliabilities under the Act unless it is waived  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The   first  principal  category  of  amendments   is\r\n\r\npresumably  to  bring the Workmen's Compensation  Act\r\n\r\ninto  line  with the Employment Act (Chapter  123  of 1970 Edition) and the other associated  legislation.\r\n\r\nI,  however,  must comment that the  raising  of  the\r\n\r\nsalary   ceiling  for  non-manual  workers  is   more\r\n\r\napparent than real. It should be noted that the class\r\n\r\nof  non-manual workers who earn a salary of  $400  at\r\n\r\nthe  time  when  the Workmen's Compensation  Act  was\r\n\r\nfirst  brought  into operation in 1954  may  possibly\r\n\r\ncorrespond to a class of non-manual workers earning a\r\n\r\nsalary higher than $750 per month at present in  view\r\n\r\nof  the  rise  in  the  general wage  level  and  the\r\n\r\ndecrease  in  the real value or purchasing  power  of\r\n\r\nmoney during the intervening period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the proposals relating to the triple\r\n\r\nincrease in the rates of monetary compensation  under\r\n\r\nthe Act, I wholeheartedly agree that such increase is\r\n\r\ntimely  if  not  long  overdue.  The  principal  Act,\r\n\r\nhowever,  contains certain anomalies which, far  from\r\n\r\nbeing  dealt  with, are being propagated without  the\r\n\r\nslightest  alteration  or  rectification  under   the\r\n\r\nproposed  Bill. I shall be touching on this point  in\r\n\r\ngreater detail later on in my speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of compulsory insurance by\r\n\r\nemployers against their liabilities under the Act, it\r\n\r\nmakes a welcome change from the prevailing provision.\r\n\r\nUnder the prevailing provisions of the Act, it is not\r\n\r\nobligatory for any employer to insure himself against\r\n\r\nhis liabilities under the Act. Under the Bill, it  is\r\n\r\nproposed that an employer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be compelled to insure himself unless  he  is\r\n\r\nexempted  by the Minister. Presumably the  Government\r\n\r\nwill exempt itself. While I shall be touching more on\r\n\r\nthis  point  later  on, for the  present  I  wish  to\r\n\r\ncomment  that  it  would  be desirable  if  the  Bill\r\n\r\nindicates, at least generally, the basis on which the\r\n\r\nMinister may exempt an employer from the requirements\r\n\r\nof compulsory insurance under the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the specific provisions of the Bill, I wish\r\n\r\nto  direct the attention of Members of this House  to\r\n\r\nclause 4 which seeks to amend section 4 of the Act by\r\n\r\ndeleting  section 5 thereof and replacing it  with  a\r\n\r\nnew  provision. On the face of it, the amendment does\r\n\r\nnot  seem  to  involve any fundamental principle  and\r\n\r\nappears  to be of little practical significance.  But\r\n\r\nthere  are  two points which should be considered  by\r\n\r\nthis  House before approving the amendment now  under\r\n\r\nreference.  One  point is that  while  the  amendment\r\n\r\nseeks   to   reduce  the  period   under   which   no\r\n\r\ncompensation  is  payable under  the  Act  from  four\r\n\r\nconsecutive  days  to  three  consecutive  days,  the\r\n\r\namendment   also  abolishes  the  saving  clause   in\r\n\r\nrelation   to  such  period.  Under  the   prevailing\r\n\r\nprovision  of  the Act, the period of four  days  for\r\n\r\nwhich no compensation is payable is clarified by  the\r\n\r\ncondition  whether  the total  period  of  incapacity\r\n\r\nexceeds  14  days  or  not. But  under  the  proposed\r\n\r\namendment  the  period of three days is  an  absolute\r\n\r\nperiod for which no compensation is payable. In other\r\n\r\nwords,  a  worker  would  not  be  entitled  to   any\r\n\r\ncompensation  for  the  first  three  days   of   his\r\n\r\nincapacity,  irrespective  of  whether  he   may   be\r\n\r\nultimately incapacitated for a period of 14  days  or\r\n\r\nmore.  I  have always been under the impression  that\r\n\r\nthe  intention  of  including  the  provision  of  an\r\n\r\ninitial  period for which no compensation is payable,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  a  saving clause,  is  apparently  to\r\n\r\nprevent  any  possible abuse of  the  provision.  The\r\n\r\nproposed   amendment,  by  excluding  the  qualifying\r\n\r\ncondition, takes on a punitive character in  relation\r\n\r\nto workers. The Government may have strong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasons for putting forward such an amendment. It may\r\n\r\nwell   be  that  by  reason  of  the  provision   for\r\n\r\ncompulsory  insurance it may not be  administratively\r\n\r\nconvenient or practical to include the first few days\r\n\r\nof any period of incapacity for the purpose of paying\r\n\r\ncompensation under the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In proposing the amendment, it may be also possible\r\n\r\nthat   the   Government   is   influenced   by    the\r\n\r\nconsideration  that  it  may be  more  practical  for\r\n\r\nworkers  as  well  as their respective  employers  to\r\n\r\ntreat the initial first few days of any incapacity as\r\n\r\nsick leave under the Employment Act. This leads me to\r\n\r\nthe  other  point  which  I  wish  to  bring  to  the\r\n\r\nattention  of  Members of this House. There  are  two\r\n\r\nmain  considerations  to  note  in  respect  of   the\r\n\r\nunderstanding  that  workers can utilise  their  sick\r\n\r\nleave  benefit in relation to the first few  days  of\r\n\r\nany  period of incapacity. One consideration is  that\r\n\r\nunless a collective agreement expressly provides  for\r\n\r\nsuch  period  of  incapacity to be  treated  as  sick\r\n\r\nleave, an employer may raise difficulty when a worker\r\n\r\nwishes  to claim such period as sick leave.  Even  if\r\n\r\nsuch  a  defect  in  a collective  agreement  can  be\r\n\r\nremedied  in  respect of all organised  workers,  the\r\n\r\nfact  remains that the vast majority of  workers  are\r\n\r\nnot  organised and, therefore, cannot claim  to  have\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  any collective agreement.  The  net\r\n\r\nresult  is  that it is more likely that  workers  may\r\n\r\nhave  to bear the full cost of the first few days  of\r\n\r\nincapacity  rather than the employers  by  reason  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  provision  as proposed under  the  Bill.  I,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  suggest that if the Government  considers\r\n\r\nit  necessary to have such an amendment to subsection\r\n\r\n(5) of section 4 of the Act, then it is only fair and\r\n\r\nreasonable  that the initial first few  days  of  any\r\n\r\nincapacity should be treated as sick leave under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Employment Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill, by amending section 8 of the\r\n\r\nAct  and  thereby  trebling  the  maximum  amount  of\r\n\r\ncompensation  payable thereunder, has  attracted  the\r\n\r\nmost  comments  from  the  public.  The  comments  of\r\n\r\nworkers on the proposed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment are favourable and so are `the comments  of\r\n\r\nmost   employers,   apart  from  the   few   die-hard\r\n\r\nexceptions.  I do not believe that any  sane  person,\r\n\r\nwhether  inside or outside this House,  would  grudge\r\n\r\nthe increase in the amount of compensation to be paid\r\n\r\nto  a workman or his dependant's in the event of  his\r\n\r\ndeath  or  incapacity within the ambit  of  the  Act.\r\n\r\nUnder  the proposed subsection (2) of section 8,  the\r\n\r\namount  of  maximum benefit payable to the dependants\r\n\r\nof  a workman who died is $21,600 as compared to  the\r\n\r\nexisting  maximum of $7,200. In subsection  (3),  the\r\n\r\namount  of  compensation payable  to  a  workman  who\r\n\r\nsuffers  permanent total incapacity is a  maximum  of\r\n\r\n$28,800  or, if he is incapable as well of performing\r\n\r\nthe  essential actions of life by himself, a  maximum\r\n\r\nof $36,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned, however, that the basis of computing\r\n\r\ncompensation under the proposed section  8  may  give\r\n\r\nrise  to  anomalies which may in turn result  in  the\r\n\r\ndependants  of the deceased workman being better  off\r\n\r\nthan those of a permanently and totally incapacitated\r\n\r\nworkman.  Comparing, for instance,  the  compensation\r\n\r\npayable  under the proposed subsection  (2)  (a)  (i)\r\n\r\nwith  that payable under the proposed subsection  (3)\r\n\r\n(a),  on the basis of the stipulated minimum wage  of\r\n\r\n$120  per month for a worker who is 18 years  of  age\r\n\r\nand  above,  it  would appear that  the  compensation\r\n\r\npayable  under the proposed subsection  (2)  (a)  (i)\r\n\r\nwould  amount  to 72 x 120 or $8,640,  and  that  the\r\n\r\ncompensation payable under subsection (3)  (a)  would\r\n\r\nequal to 60 x 120 or $7,200. It has been the practice\r\n\r\nfor  any  court of law to award higher damages  to  a\r\n\r\nworkman  incapacitated by injury  resulting  from  an\r\n\r\naccident than to the dependants of a deceased person.\r\n\r\nThe basis for such practice is that the person who is\r\n\r\ninjured  but  survives would logically  have  greater\r\n\r\nsuffering and would be likely to incur more  expenses\r\n\r\nby  way  of  his own maintenance than the person  who\r\n\r\ndied  as  the  result of the accident. Such  practice\r\n\r\nseems to have been adopted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby the Government because the maximum benefit payable\r\n\r\non  the  death  of a worker is $21,600 as  stated  in\r\n\r\nsubsection (2), and the maximum compensation  payable\r\n\r\nto   an  injured  worker  is  $28,800  as  stated  in\r\n\r\nsubsection (3). On the basis of a workman earning the\r\n\r\nminimum  wage of $120 a month, the dependants  of  an\r\n\r\ninjured   workman  who  is  unable  to  perform   the\r\n\r\nessential  actions  of  life  without  the   constant\r\n\r\nattention  of  another  person,  however,  the  total\r\n\r\ncompensation  payable  on the  basis  of  60  months'\r\n\r\nearnings will amount to 75 x 120 or $9,000, which  is\r\n\r\nbarely  $500  more  than  the  sum  awarded  to   the\r\n\r\ndependants   of  a  deceased  workman.   Insufficient\r\n\r\nconsideration seems to have been given  to  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  a permanently and totally incapacitated worker,\r\n\r\nthough able to perform the essential actions of  life\r\n\r\nwithout  the  constant attention of  another  person,\r\n\r\nposes  a  continuing and additional burden  upon  his\r\n\r\ndependants, which would not have been the case if  he\r\n\r\nhad  died  instead of being permanently  and  totally\r\n\r\nincapacitated.  Such calculation may  be  branded  as\r\n\r\nbeing  callous and unduly cynical, but  the  fact  is\r\n\r\nthat  we are a pragmatic people living in a pragmatic\r\n\r\nsociety.  To  my  mind, the persons  responsible  for\r\n\r\ndrafting  the  proposed amendment  to  the  Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation  Act  seem to have contented  themselves\r\n\r\nwith   merely   trebling  the  various   amounts   of\r\n\r\ncompensation  payable under the Act and  leaving  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  of the Act untouched.  For  instance,\r\n\r\nunder   the  proposed  subsection  (3),  a  necessary\r\n\r\ndistinction seems to have been made as to  whether  a\r\n\r\nworker  is  over or under the age of 16 or 18  years.\r\n\r\nThe  fact that such distinction is contained  in  the\r\n\r\npresent  Act is not sufficient justification for  its\r\n\r\nreproduction in the Bill. I would have thought that a\r\n\r\nproper  distinction  should  have  been  made  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  the incapacitated worker has any  dependants\r\n\r\nor not. 1 would therefore suggest that subsection (3)\r\n\r\nof  section 8 of the Act should be amended to provide\r\n\r\nfor  the payment of compensation to a workman who  is\r\n\r\nincapacitated  but  who has no dependants  a  sum  of\r\n\r\n$28,800\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  equal to 108 months' earnings, whichever  is  the\r\n\r\nless,  and  the payment of compensation to a  workman\r\n\r\nwho is incapacitated and who has dependants `a sum of\r\n\r\n$36,000  or equal to 135 `months' earnings, whichever\r\n\r\nis the less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of clause 15 of the Bill amending\r\n\r\nsection  26  of  the  Act to provide  for  compulsory\r\n\r\ninsurance  by an employer of his liability under  the\r\n\r\nAct  is  in  the general interest of the  worker  for\r\n\r\nwhose  protection such a provision is intended. While\r\n\r\nI  appreciate  the  move by the `Government  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection,  I  am  of  the  view  that  it   is   not\r\n\r\nsufficiently  effective. For instance,  the  proposed\r\n\r\nsubsection  (2)  and `subsection (3)  of  section  26\r\n\r\ncontain  provisions  prohibiting  any  avoidance   or\r\n\r\nevasion  by  an employer of his liability  under  the\r\n\r\nAct.  The Act is not sufficiently comprehensive.  The\r\n\r\nwhole  provision of subsection (2) of section  26  as\r\n\r\nstated   in  the  Bill  revolves  around   the   word\r\n\r\n\"deduction\" in relation to the earnings of a  worker.\r\n\r\nBut to my mind if an unscrupulous employer desires to\r\n\r\nevade  `this particular provision, he would not  have\r\n\r\nbeen  so foolish as to deduct from `the wages of  his\r\n\r\nworkers the premium payable under an insurance  cover\r\n\r\nin  respect of his liability under the Act. With  his\r\n\r\nabsolute  prerogative  to hire  and  fire  under  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations  Act,  it  would  have  been  a\r\n\r\nrelatively  simple matter for an employer to  dismiss\r\n\r\nhis   workers  and  offer  them  re-employment   with\r\n\r\nslightly lower salaries. It should be noted that most\r\n\r\nmanual  workers in the construction industry,  which\r\n\r\noften  hits  the headlines with fatal accidents,  are\r\n\r\nemployed or paid on a daily-rated basis. It would  be\r\n\r\nperfectly legitimate for an employer to pay a wage of\r\n\r\n$10  a  day  before  the introduction  of  compulsory\r\n\r\ninsurance under the Workmen's Compensation Act and to\r\n\r\noffer  a  wage of $9 a day to a worker  under  a  new\r\n\r\ncontract  the  day  after `the introduction  of  such\r\n\r\nprovision  for compulsory insurance. Even  if  it  is\r\n\r\npossible  `for  the  Government  to  succeed  in  its\r\n\r\nprosecution  of such an employer under `the  proposed\r\n\r\nsection  26  as presently worded, it would  be  scant\r\n\r\nconsolation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  a  worker  who has been previously dismissed  for\r\n\r\nobjecting to an attempt by his employer to  so  avoid\r\n\r\nhis liabilities under the Act, that such employer  is\r\n\r\nconvicted for so contravening the Act. I suggest  the\r\n\r\nphrase  \"or  any  reduction off\" should  be  included\r\n\r\nafter the phrase \"any reduction from\". As it is,  the\r\n\r\nproposed  provision  contains  a  sufficiently  large\r\n\r\nenough loophole for a bulldozer to plough through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 of the Bill gives effect to a long overdue\r\n\r\namendment  of  the First Schedule  to  the  Act.  The\r\n\r\nproposed    First   Schedule   is   generally    more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  than the existing  Schedule.  I  feel,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that  in  making  such  an  amendment   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not gone as far as it should  have  in\r\n\r\nrevising  the  scope  of  the  First  Schedule.   Not\r\n\r\nsufficient consideration seems to have been given  to\r\n\r\nthe  circumstance  that  a  person  ordinarily  makes\r\n\r\ngreater  use  of  one hand than  the  other.  In  the\r\n\r\nproposed   Schedule  as  well  as  in  the   existing\r\n\r\nSchedule, the computation of loss of earning capacity\r\n\r\nis  based  on  the  assumption that every  person  is\r\n\r\nambidextrous, that is, has equal facility or  agility\r\n\r\nin  the  use of either hand or arm. I am of the  view\r\n\r\nthat  in  all cases of permanent incapacity involving\r\n\r\nthe loss of an arm or a hand, a distinction should be\r\n\r\nmade  whether  it  is  an arm  or  a  hand  that  i's\r\n\r\nhabitually used or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed Schedule the quantum of\r\n\r\nincapacity  in relation to the loss of a hand  or  an\r\n\r\narm  appears  to  be  determined  by  the  degree  of\r\n\r\nreduction  in  earning capacity in  every  employment\r\n\r\nwhich the injured worker was able to undertake at the\r\n\r\ntime   of   the  accident  and  which  requires   the\r\n\r\nindiscriminate use of both arms and hands. Where  the\r\n\r\nrange  of  employment open to the injured  worker  at\r\n\r\n`the time of accident is such as to enable him to use\r\n\r\none  hand or arm more than the other or in preference\r\n\r\nto the other, the reduction in earning capacity ought\r\n\r\nto  depend  on  whether  the  hand  or  arm  lost  is\r\n\r\nhabitually  used  or  not. Moreover,  the  older  the\r\n\r\ninjured  worker the harder it would  be  for  him  to\r\n\r\nadjust to the loss of an arm or hand habitually  used\r\n\r\nwhether for the purpose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  working  or performing the essential  actions  of\r\n\r\nlife.  On  the  basis of my comment, I  suggest  that\r\n\r\nitems  No. 8 to 20 in the proposed Schedule  relating\r\n\r\nto  the  computation of loss of earning  capacity  in\r\n\r\nrespect of an arm or a hand should be amended to take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration whether such arm or hand lost  is\r\n\r\none which is habitually used by the worker affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further comment I wish to make iii regard to the\r\n\r\nFirst  Schedule to the Workmen's Compensation Act  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  injuries  which are deemed  to  result  in\r\n\r\npermanent incapacity as listed therein seem to be  of\r\n\r\na  purely  physical character without any  exception.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill itself does not envisage any change in  the\r\n\r\nnature of the contents of such First Schedule,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  revision  of  the percentage  of  loss  of\r\n\r\nearning  capacity in relation to the listed injuries.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the basic assumption runs throughout the Act\r\n\r\nthat  any  injury resulting in permanent Or temporary\r\n\r\nincapacity   must  be  of  a  physical  nature.   Yet\r\n\r\nincreasing cognisance has been taken in certain parts\r\n\r\nof   the   world  of  the  possibility  of  a  worker\r\n\r\nsustaining mental illness or injury in the course  of\r\n\r\nhis  employment resulting in permanent  or  temporary\r\n\r\nincapacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main difficulty of or objection to including\r\n\r\nmental  illness  within the scope  of  any  workmen's\r\n\r\ncompensation legislation lies in the fact `that, with\r\n\r\nour  present level of knowledge, the etiology of  any\r\n\r\nmental  illness may give rise to a controversy  which\r\n\r\ncannot be satisfactorily resolved. One way of cutting\r\n\r\nthe  Gordian knot of mental illness is to  adopt  the\r\n\r\nratio decidendi of the United States Court of Appeals\r\n\r\nin  the District of Columbia which has ruled that the\r\n\r\nonus is for an employer to disprove, rather than  for\r\n\r\nan  employee  to  prove, a causal connection  between\r\n\r\nemployment  and  disability in  the  case  of  mental\r\n\r\nillness  related  to the job. If  such  a  basis  for\r\n\r\nbringing mental illness within the ambit of workmen's\r\n\r\ncompensation legislation is accepted in Singapore, it\r\n\r\nwould mean that a worker need only prove that his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmental  illness is caused by work to collect whatever\r\n\r\nbenefits are payable under the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members in this House may be of the view that\r\n\r\nsuch  sophisticated development of  the  concept  and\r\n\r\npractice of workmen's compensation is a luxury  which\r\n\r\nSingapore cannot afford in the present stage  of  its\r\n\r\nindustrial  development. While it is  true  that  the\r\n\r\ninclusion of injuries of a mental character  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of determining incapacity under the Act  may\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  whole  wide range of complexities  with\r\n\r\ntheir  accompanying confusion, I am of the view  that\r\n\r\nthis  House  should take note of the  need  to  bring\r\n\r\nmental illness within the ambit of the Act some  time\r\n\r\nin  the  not  too distant future. It is already  `the\r\n\r\nprevalent view of a section of the medical profession\r\n\r\nin  Singapore that the gathering momentum of economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  has brought about with it an  increasing\r\n\r\ntempo of life and a heightening of social tension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hardly qualified or in any position to comment\r\n\r\nany  further  on the various medical aspects  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem of relating mental illness to the purpose  of\r\n\r\nthe Workmen's Compensation Act. But I sincerely think\r\n\r\nthat  it is a matter that the Government should  look\r\n\r\ninto, not merely for the sake of the workers but also\r\n\r\non  account  of  the  possible repercussion  of  `the\r\n\r\nproblem  of mental illness on the further development\r\n\r\nof   Singapore.  Perhaps  the  proposed   Board   for\r\n\r\noccupational illnesses and diseases may  be  directed\r\n\r\nto look into this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have so far dealt with the specific provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  amending  the Workmen's Compensation  Act.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  Bill is most commendable in its intention\r\n\r\nand  attempt  to revise the Act and bring  it  up  to\r\n\r\ndate, it is to be regretted that no attempt has  been\r\n\r\nmade to revise the basis or scope of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term \"compensation\" seems to have given rise to\r\n\r\nthe  impression that whatever compensation or benefit\r\n\r\nthat   is   to  be  conferred  under  the  Act   must\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be monetary. I am inclined to  the  view\r\n\r\nthat the purpose of any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch Act is not merely to provide for the payment  of\r\n\r\nmonetary  compensation to workers who  have  suffered\r\n\r\ninjury or accident arising out of or in the course of\r\n\r\ntheir  employment,  but also  to  compensate  in  any\r\n\r\nmanner  for  the loss of or reduction in the  working\r\n\r\ncapacity of such injured person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis of the Act is actually directed at the\r\n\r\nloss   of   working  capacity,  whether  totally   or\r\n\r\npartially,  and  whether permanently or  temporarily.\r\n\r\nAnd  such loss of working capacity is related to  the\r\n\r\nrange of employment open to the injured worker at the\r\n\r\ntime   of  the  accident.  The  payment  of  monetary\r\n\r\ncompensation  is  only one of the  means,  granted  a\r\n\r\nconvenient  and  practical  method  of  helping   the\r\n\r\ninjured  worker to adjust to the loss of or reduction\r\n\r\nin   his   working  capacity.  While   such   payment\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  serves to compensate the injured  worker\r\n\r\nand  his  depend-ants for the loss of wages, it  does\r\n\r\nnot  in  any  way  prevent or minimise  the  loss  to\r\n\r\nsociety   of   skilled  manpower  through  industrial\r\n\r\naccidents or even the demoralising effect of enforced\r\n\r\nidleness upon the injured workers themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent publicity given to the need for providing\r\n\r\nsufficient   employment  opportunities  for   persons\r\n\r\nsuffering  from various physical disabilities  serves\r\n\r\nto  underline  the  fact that  disabled  persons  can\r\n\r\nperform  useful  and constructive  functions  in  the\r\n\r\n`society in which they live, provided they are  given\r\n\r\nthe  opportunities  compatible  with  their  physical\r\n\r\ncondition.  What has prevented such disabled  persons\r\n\r\nfrom  obtaining gainful employment in the  past,  and\r\n\r\neven today, is not the fear of the potential employer\r\n\r\nthat  the  disabled persons are not able  to  justify\r\n\r\nwhatever salaries or wages are paid to them  but  the\r\n\r\nirrational  prejudice  of  employers  to  equate  any\r\n\r\nphysical  disability with the total loss  of  earning\r\n\r\ncapacity. If it is accepted that disabled persons who\r\n\r\nhave  no  previous  experience of gainful  employment\r\n\r\ndeserve    reasonable   opportunities   of    gainful\r\n\r\nemployment, then it should be beyond any question  of\r\n\r\ndoubt that an incapacitated worker who has not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  previous  experience of gainful employment  but\r\n\r\nalso  varying  degrees of skill or  experience  in  a\r\n\r\nspecific  field of employment, should be  accorded  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  opportunity  of  continuing  any  gainful\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore suggest that the compensation for\r\n\r\nthe  loss  of  earning  or working  capacity  through\r\n\r\nindustrial accidents should be made on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nthe rehabilitation of the injured workers as well  as\r\n\r\n`the payment of monetary benefit to such workers  and\r\n\r\ntheir  dependants.  Similarly, provisions  should  be\r\n\r\nincluded in the Act, as far as it is consistent  with\r\n\r\nthe scope of the Act, to prevent or minimise the loss\r\n\r\nof  working  capacity  through industrial  accidents.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  Act  as  it  stands at  present,  medical\r\n\r\nexamination is prescribed only after the workers have\r\n\r\nsuffered injuries. I am of the view that, taking into\r\n\r\nconsideration the provision for compulsory  insurance\r\n\r\nunder  the  Act  and the nature of  the  occupational\r\n\r\ndiseases  or  injuries  as  set  out  in  the  Second\r\n\r\nSchedule  thereto,  it  may  be  desirable   that   a\r\n\r\nprovision  be  included for the yearly or  periodical\r\n\r\nmedical  examination of workers  at  the  expense  of\r\n\r\ntheir   employers  for  the  purpose  of   preventing\r\n\r\nunnecessary injury and facilitating the determination\r\n\r\nof  the  nature  of the degree of the injury  in  the\r\n\r\nevent of an accident occurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also be desirable, in conjunction with any\r\n\r\nscheme for compulsory and regular medical examination\r\n\r\nof  workers  at  the expense of their  employers,  to\r\n\r\nrequire any employer to provide workers who are found\r\n\r\nunfit  for  regular employment as a  result  of  such\r\n\r\nmedical   examination  with  lighter  or  alternative\r\n\r\nduties  within  the  means  and  capability  of   the\r\n\r\nemployer. Otherwise such a scheme for compulsory  and\r\n\r\nregular medical examination of workers would turn out\r\n\r\nto  be  more  of  a  curse than a blessing,  as  some\r\n\r\nemployers  may  prefer to take the easy  way  out  by\r\n\r\ncallously  dismissing workers who  are  found  to  be\r\n\r\nmedically unfit for their usual employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b>Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the Bill in principle. The\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill provide for desirable\r\n\r\namendments to the Workmen's Compensation Act,\r\n\r\nparticularly those amendments regarding the maximum\r\n\r\namount of benefits variously obtainable under the\r\n\r\nAct. I find it necessary to seek clarification in\r\n\r\nrespect of some of the proposed amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 3 of the Bill, among the various\r\n\r\namendments  proposed therein, the new  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"earnings\" is worded to include \"overtime payments or\r\n\r\nother  special  remuneration for work done\"  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of computing the compensation payable  to  a\r\n\r\nworkman  under  the  Act in the event  of  injury  or\r\n\r\ndeath.  Such  overtime payments and other  allowances\r\n\r\nare qualified by the phrase \"if of constant character\r\n\r\nor   for   work  habitually  performed\".  While   the\r\n\r\nprovision  contained in this definition of \"earnings\"\r\n\r\nappears to be reasonably clear as to the intention of\r\n\r\nthis legislation to provide for an equitable basis of\r\n\r\ncomputing the compensation payable to a worker in the\r\n\r\nevent  of an industrial accident, it is not so  clear\r\n\r\nas  to  how  to determine the basis in a satisfactory\r\n\r\nmanner.   As  a  trade  unionist,  it  has  been   my\r\n\r\nexperience  that overtime payments and other  similar\r\n\r\nallowances may be of a constant character or for work\r\n\r\nhabitually performed, but the actual amount  of  such\r\n\r\novertime payments or allowances may greatly vary from\r\n\r\nmonth  to month, from week to week, or even from  day\r\n\r\nto  day. The indication in the Bill seems to be  that\r\n\r\nsuch  overtime  payments  or  allowances  should   be\r\n\r\ndetermined  in  respect  of  the  period  immediately\r\n\r\npreceding   the   industrial   accident   for   which\r\n\r\ncompensation is payable under the Act. The difficulty\r\n\r\nis that it is not clear whether such period should be\r\n\r\nthe last few years, the last few months, the last few\r\n\r\nweeks,  or  the  last few days before the  industrial\r\n\r\naccident. The importance of having a standard  period\r\n\r\nfor  the  computation of earnings for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nquantifying  the  compensation  properly  payable  is\r\n\r\nunquestionable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  those  cases  where  the   amount   of\r\n\r\ncompensation  to be paid is below the  maximum  limit\r\n\r\nspecified by this Bill. Thus, if earnings are  to  be\r\n\r\ncomputed   on   the   basis  of  a  worker's   total'\r\n\r\nremuneration  during  the last  month  preceding  his\r\n\r\nindustrial  accident,  the'  amount  of  compensation\r\n\r\ndetermined  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nsection  8 of the Act may vary by as much as  20  per\r\n\r\ncent,  depending  on  the actual amount  of  overtime\r\n\r\npayments or other' allowances he received during that\r\n\r\nlast  month.  Thus an anomalous situation  may  arise\r\n\r\nwhere two workers, receiving the same amount of wages\r\n\r\nand normally the same amount of overtime payments  or\r\n\r\nother   allowances,  may  actually   receive   widely\r\n\r\ndifferent  amounts of compensation for the same  type\r\n\r\nand  degree of incapacity, simply because during  the\r\n\r\nlast  month  preceding  their  respective  industrial\r\n\r\naccidents   one  worker  might  have  received   more\r\n\r\novertime payments or other allowances than the other-worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore suggest that some formula or other\r\n\r\nguideline  be  incorporated into  the  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"earnings\"  for  the-purpose  of  standardising   the\r\n\r\ncomputation of overtime payments or other  allowances\r\n\r\nfor   the  purpose  of  determining  the  amount   of\r\n\r\ncompensation properly payable under the Act.  In  the\r\n\r\nabsence  of  such formula or guideline,  there  is  a\r\n\r\npossibility that the proposed basis of computing such\r\n\r\nearnings  may  give  rise  to  misunderstanding   and\r\n\r\nfriction  between  the workers  concerned  and  their\r\n\r\nrespective employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the same clause 3 of the Bill, a new\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"employer\" is proposed in place of  the\r\n\r\nexisting   definition.   The   new   definition    is\r\n\r\nsubstantially   a   reproduction  of   the   existing\r\n\r\ndefinition  and  seems to be mainly dictated  by  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  provide  for  the radical  changes  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical  situation of Singapore since the enactment\r\n\r\nof  the  Act  more than a decade ago.  It  is  to  be\r\n\r\nregretted that the opportunity has not been taken  to\r\n\r\nwiden the scope of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe definition of \"employer\" in relation to the phrase\r\n\r\nappearing therein, i.e.:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"where the services of a workman are temporarily\r\n\r\nlent  or  let on hire to another person by the  person\r\n\r\nwith  whom the workman has entered into a contract  of\r\n\r\nservice or apprenticeship\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  situation covered by this phrase applies  to  the\r\n\r\npractice  of  contract or subcontract  for  labour  as\r\n\r\nprevailing  in the Republic. Such a phrase  would  not\r\n\r\nconceivably cover a situation where a person may enter\r\n\r\ninto a contract for services in contradistinction to a\r\n\r\ncontract of service on his own behalf or on behalf  of\r\n\r\na group of other persons. The reason, as I see it, for\r\n\r\nmaking a principal liable under the Act in respect  of\r\n\r\nthe  employees  of  a contractor or  subcontractor  of\r\n\r\nlabour   is   that,  in  the  event  of  the   insurer\r\n\r\ndisclaiming liability under the Act, the principal  is\r\n\r\nmore  likely  to  be  a  person  or  organisation   of\r\n\r\nsubstantial  means  with  the necessary  capacity  for\r\n\r\ngiving  effect to the provisions of the Act  governing\r\n\r\nthe payment of compensation thereunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proposal to make it compulsory for an\r\n\r\nemployer to insure against liability under the Act, it\r\n\r\nis  likely  for an unscrupulous person or organisation\r\n\r\nemploying  contract  labour to attempt  to  evade  the\r\n\r\napplication of the Act after the coming into operation\r\n\r\nthereof  by  converting all contracts of service  into\r\n\r\ncontracts for services. It may well be argued that the\r\n\r\ncontractor or subcontractor for labour may be a person\r\n\r\nor  organisation of sufficiently substantial means  to\r\n\r\nbe   able  to  give  satisfactory  discharge  to   his\r\n\r\nliabilities under the Act. My point is that as long as\r\n\r\nthere  is a possibility of evading the application  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act by converting the contract of service into  a\r\n\r\ncontract for services, the evasion of the applications\r\n\r\nof  the  Act  may have disastrous consequences  for  a\r\n\r\nworker  injured  in  an  industrial  accident  if  the\r\n\r\ncontractor who is deemed to be the employer under  the\r\n\r\nAct  is  a  man of straw and fails for one  reason  or\r\n\r\nother  to  have  a valid insurance cover  against  his\r\n\r\nliabilities under the Act. I will be dealing with this\r\n\r\nin greater detail when I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomment  upon  the  provisions of the  Bill  regarding\r\n\r\ncompulsory  insurance.  For  the  present  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  that  the prosecution of  an  employer  for\r\n\r\ncontravention  of the Act will in no way  resolve  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of payment of compensation properly  payable\r\n\r\nunder the Act to a workman who has been injured in  an\r\n\r\nindustrial accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 15 of the Bill, by repealing\r\n\r\nthe  existing  section 26 of the Act and replacing  it\r\n\r\nwith  the new provision, introduces a significant  and\r\n\r\nvital element to the Act. Under the existing Act there\r\n\r\nis  no  obligation for an employer to  insure  himself\r\n\r\nagainst  his liabilities under the Act. The result  is\r\n\r\nthat  the tragedy of the' worker who had an industrial\r\n\r\naccident is possibly compounded by the further tragedy\r\n\r\nof   his  inability  to  obtain  any  compensation  as\r\n\r\nprovided  for under the Act by reason of his  employer\r\n\r\nbeing  uninsured and being incapable  of  meeting  his\r\n\r\nliabilities under the Act. The proposed provision  for\r\n\r\ncompulsory  insurance  by  the  employer  against  his\r\n\r\nliabilities  under  this  Act  is,  therefore,    very\r\n\r\ncommendable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, however, certain doubts about this particular\r\n\r\nprovision  which I hope the Minister will be  able  to\r\n\r\nclarify  for  me. It is very well to provide  for  the\r\n\r\npunishment   of   an  employer  who  contravenes   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of compulsory insurance in any manner.  But\r\n\r\nwhat this Act has failed to make clear is the position\r\n\r\nof  the  workers of an employer who has been convicted\r\n\r\nof  such  contravention of the Act. The situation  may\r\n\r\narise  where  an employer, either through  wilful  and\r\n\r\ndeliberate action or negligent omission on his part to\r\n\r\ninsure, has sufficient cause to disclaim liability for\r\n\r\nthe  payment of full or any compensation to an injured\r\n\r\nworker  under  the  Act by reason of  his  failure  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with any of the conditions in the contract  of\r\n\r\ninsurance  covering his liability  under  the  Act.  A\r\n\r\nlikely cause for such a situation would be an instance\r\n\r\nin inaccurate declaration by an employer of the actual\r\n\r\nnumber  of  employees  for the  purpose  of  insurance\r\n\r\ncoverage. Should one of his employees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubsequently meet with an industrial accident and  be\r\n\r\nentitled  to  claim compensation under the  Act,  the\r\n\r\ninsurer  concerned may very well claim  that  as  the\r\n\r\nemployer  has made a fraudulent declaration  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of paying less insurance premium than  would\r\n\r\notherwise   be  payable  by  him,  the  insurer   can\r\n\r\naccordingly  exercise  the  right  to  disclaim   any\r\n\r\nliability under the insurance contract as a result of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  wrongful  disclosure by the employer.  While\r\n\r\nthere  is  some controversy about the correctness  of\r\n\r\nthe  judicial  precedent  for  the  doctrine  that  a\r\n\r\ncontract  of  insurance should be treated differently\r\n\r\nfrom  any other contract on the ground that full  and\r\n\r\nfrank  disclosure of any relevant particulars  is  an\r\n\r\nessential element for the validity of the contract of\r\n\r\ninsurance,  there can be no doubt that,  as  the  law\r\n\r\nstands  at  present, any failure of  an  employer  to\r\n\r\ncomply  strictly  with  any  of  the  conditions   of\r\n\r\ncontract  of  insurance  would  have  the  effect  of\r\n\r\ninvalidating  such  a contract. The  tragedy  of  the\r\n\r\nsubsequent  invalidation of a contract of  insurance,\r\n\r\nas  I  have said earlier, lies in the effect  on  the\r\n\r\nclaim  of  an injured worker to whatever compensation\r\n\r\nis payable under the Act. If the employer is a person\r\n\r\nor  an  organisation of substantial means,  not  much\r\n\r\nharm  would have resulted from the disclaimer by  the\r\n\r\ninsurer  of his liability under the Act. But  if  the\r\n\r\nemployer  is  not in such a fortunate  position,  the\r\n\r\nplight of the injured worker, needless to say,  would\r\n\r\nbe  beyond any legal or legitimate recourse. If there\r\n\r\nare  any  doubts whether the nightmare I am  painting\r\n\r\nmay  not  be over-exaggerated, I need only call  your\r\n\r\nattention,   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  to  the   identical\r\n\r\nsituation arising in the event of a traffic  accident\r\n\r\nwhere  the  relevant insurer disclaims all  liability\r\n\r\nfor the action of the party solely or principally  to\r\n\r\nbe  blamed for the action. Over the years there  have\r\n\r\nbeen several cases where the victims, after obtaining\r\n\r\njudgment  for  the injuries arising  from  accidents,\r\n\r\nfind that there are no ways\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor   means  of  enforcing  the  judgment,  since  the\r\n\r\nrelevant insurers have disclaimed liability  and  the\r\n\r\njudgment  debtors  are  persons  of  straw.  I  have,\r\n\r\nhowever,  been given to understand that all insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies have voluntarily formed a pool for  meeting\r\n\r\nthe   claims  of  third  parties  who  have  suffered\r\n\r\ninjuries  as a result of any culpable act by  persons\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  whom  the respective  insurers  have\r\n\r\ndisclaimed liability. While it is true that a similar\r\n\r\npool  may  be  organised by insurers to  meet  claims\r\n\r\nunder the Workmen's Compensation Act in the event  of\r\n\r\nany  individual  insurer disclaiming liability  under\r\n\r\nthe  Act by reason of any breach of contract or faith\r\n\r\nby  the  respective  clients,  I  think  it  is  more\r\n\r\ndesirable that there should be a provision to require\r\n\r\nan  insurer to be primarily responsible for the claim\r\n\r\nof the injured workman under the Act and subsequently\r\n\r\nto  recover the money paid out under such claim  from\r\n\r\nthe  defaulting employer. It is pointless to  provide\r\n\r\ncompensation in respect of the death or injury  of  a\r\n\r\nworker as a result of an industrial accident when  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time  the  Act makes it  possible  for  an\r\n\r\ninsurer to disclaim any liability for the payment  of\r\n\r\nsuch compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental purpose, as I see it, of making it\r\n\r\ncompulsory  for  an  employer to insure  against  his\r\n\r\nliability  under  the  Act is  to  ensure  that  such\r\n\r\ncompensation would be paid, as the insurer would  be,\r\n\r\nby  reason  of  the  nature of  his  business,  in  a\r\n\r\ncomparably better and stronger position to effect the\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  liability  under  the  Act  than   any\r\n\r\nemployer.  For  those employers who  are  persons  or\r\n\r\norganisations of substantial means and who  are  able\r\n\r\nto  meet  their  liability under the  Act,  there  is\r\n\r\nprovision  for the Minister to exempt them  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of compulsory insurance. Such  being  the\r\n\r\ncase,  I sincerely think that it is advisable that  a\r\n\r\nprovision should he incorporated into the Act to  the\r\n\r\neffect that any question of any breach of contract or\r\n\r\nfaith by any employer should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  matter to be resolved between the insurer and  the\r\n\r\nemployer  concerned, and should not  operate  in  any\r\n\r\nmanner that would justify the withholding of or delay\r\n\r\nin  the  payment of compensation to an injured worker\r\n\r\nunder the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.50p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\ngives me satisfaction to rise in support of the  Bill\r\n\r\nas I am among those in the House who have pressed for\r\n\r\nan  upward  revision  in  the workmen's  compensation\r\n\r\nbenefit  over  the  past few years.  Apart  from  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in monetary benefits, the Bill incorporates\r\n\r\na  number of fresh features. One of these is that  it\r\n\r\nis  now  a compulsory requirement for an employer  to\r\n\r\ninsure his liability under the Act. To my mind,  this\r\n\r\nis  an  important  safeguard,  as  has  already  been\r\n\r\npointed out by the two Members who spoke before me. I\r\n\r\nhave  personally  come  across  at  least  two  cases\r\n\r\nrecently  in  my constituency where, because  of  the\r\n\r\nabsence  of insurance, the dependants of the deceased\r\n\r\nworkmen  were left without any compensation,  as  the\r\n\r\nemployers were apparently men of straw and were in no\r\n\r\nposition to honour their statutory obligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the provision in the Bill as regards\r\n\r\ninsurance leaves much to be desired in so far as  the\r\n\r\nsafeguarding of the workmen's interest is  concerned.\r\n\r\nThis  has already been pointed out by the Member  for\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh, it  is  not  clear  whether  it  is  the\r\n\r\nintention of clause 15 to require employers to insure\r\n\r\ntheir liability under the common law also. As you are\r\n\r\naware,  an  injured workman has the right  of  option\r\n\r\neither  to claim for statutory benefit or take action\r\n\r\nagainst  his  employer  under the  common  law  where\r\n\r\nnegligence  can be proved against the  employer.  The\r\n\r\nBill  also  does  not provide any  safeguard  to  the\r\n\r\ninjured  parties  when  either because  of  defective\r\n\r\ninsurance arrangements or other reasons liability  is\r\n\r\nrepudiated by an insurer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, it is, to my mind, essential that a\r\n\r\ncentral fund be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestablished by all the insurers - the suggestion  has\r\n\r\nalready  been made by the Member for Toa Payoh  -  to\r\n\r\nensure  that all claims falling within the  scope  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act,  but which for technical reasons cannot  be\r\n\r\npaid  tinder an insurance policy, are met out of  the\r\n\r\nfund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are unscrupulous insurers, and there are also\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  legal  practitioners.  Quite  often  in\r\n\r\nexercising  their  rights under the  law  to  recover\r\n\r\ncompensation,  it becomes necessary for  the  injured\r\n\r\nworkmen  to  enlist  the help of lawyers.  When  this\r\n\r\nhappens,  the expenses involved are often costly.  In\r\n\r\ncases  where  unscrupulous  legal  practitioners  are\r\n\r\ninvolved  -  some of them have come to  be  known  as\r\n\r\n\"ambulance  chasers\"  -  the  payment  of   fees   is\r\n\r\ncalculated  on  what is called the \"No  cure  no  pay\r\n\r\nbasis\".  In  successful cases, the fees  payable  can\r\n\r\ncome  to  as much as 40 to 50 per cent of the quantum\r\n\r\nof  compensation  recovered, leaving only  negligible\r\n\r\namounts   for  the  poor  dependants.  Sir,  evidence\r\n\r\nagainst  such malpractices is unfortunately  hard  to\r\n\r\ncome  by,  but  its existence is common knowledge.  I\r\n\r\nthink the Bar Council have been trying their best  to\r\n\r\nprevent  this malpractice, but so far they  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen   particularly  successful.   To   prevent   the\r\n\r\nexploitation  of  our  workers by  such  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nparties,  I  urge  that our Legal Aid  Bureau  should\r\n\r\nconsider   the   setting  up  of  a   separate   unit\r\n\r\nspecialising in the handling of all such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, whilst the increase in the quantum of\r\n\r\ncompensation  is  a  necessary step,  it  is  only  a\r\n\r\nnegative  way  of looking after the  welfare  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers. There is only one positive approach and that\r\n\r\nis  for  all  interested parties, be they  employers,\r\n\r\nworkers  or  the  Government, to work  hand  in  hand\r\n\r\ntoward a higher standard of accident prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This  is  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  measure  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers. In this respect, it is necessary. Many of my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in this House and I have all  along  been\r\n\r\npaying  much  attention to the problem of  industrial\r\n\r\naccidents. Over the past few years we have urged  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to adopt more effective measures to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  number of industrial accidents. One of the  main\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the Bill is the provision to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  rate  of  compensation. This will  be  an  added\r\n\r\nbenefit  to  the  victims and the  members  of  their\r\n\r\nfamilies. They can henceforth be better looked after.\r\n\r\nHowever, what is more important is that we should try\r\n\r\nto  devise methods by which industrial accidents  can\r\n\r\nbe  prevented.  That is to say, we  should  urge  all\r\n\r\nemployers  to  provide  adequate  safety  precautions\r\n\r\neither  in  the  factories or at the building  sites.\r\n\r\nThere should also be an adequate number of inspectors\r\n\r\nto  go round and inspect the sites. If they find that\r\n\r\nthe  safety  precautions there are inadequate  or  if\r\n\r\nanything  is  amiss, they should  then  instruct  the\r\n\r\nemployer  concerned to take measures  to  remedy  the\r\n\r\nsituation  so that the lives of the workers  will  be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded and tragedy is thereby prevented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when a worker dies as a result of an industrial\r\n\r\naccident, it will be a tragedy not only to his family\r\n\r\n-causing members of his family to be derelicts -  but\r\n\r\nit will also be a loss tX our country. At the present\r\n\r\nstage  of  our industrialisation programme,  we  need\r\n\r\nyoung   and  capable  workers  who  can  make   their\r\n\r\ncontributions. At the moment we are short of  labour.\r\n\r\nWe  are  now  allowing thousands  of  labourers  from\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries to enter Singapore. So  if  we\r\n\r\ncan  safeguard the lives of our own workers, we  will\r\n\r\nhe contributing not only to their welfare hut also to\r\n\r\nour country's welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of our contract system. As we\r\n\r\nknow,  many  large  contractors  have  subcontractors\r\n\r\nworking under them. If there is no adequate provision\r\n\r\nin  our  laws regulating the relationship  among  the\r\n\r\ncontractors, the subcontractors and the workers, then\r\n\r\nonce  an industrial accident happens to a worker,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  difficult  for him  to  get  any  adequate\r\n\r\ncompensation unless we implement a scheme whereby all\r\n\r\ncontractors are registered to ensure that victims  of\r\n\r\nindustrial accidents are adequately compensated. Sir,\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister will look into this suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I would like to give some views on  the\r\n\r\nWorkmen's Compensation (Amendment) Bill.  In view  of\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in  the  number of  accidents  in  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  sector,  the  construction  industry  and\r\n\r\nother  fields  in  recent years, the  amendment  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  for  an increase in the maximum  amount  of\r\n\r\ncompensation from $7,200 to $21,600, which is  treble\r\n\r\nthe original amount of compensation. Judging from the\r\n\r\npresent  standard of living, this amount  of  $21,600\r\n\r\ncannot be said to be not a considerable sum of money.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  am in full support of  this  amendment\r\n\r\nBill.  However, Sir, everybody hopes to  be  able  to\r\n\r\nwork  in safety and to be able to enjoy his full span\r\n\r\nof life without any mishap. Nobody wants to encounter\r\n\r\nany  mishap  in  order to claim  compensation.  If  a\r\n\r\nworkman  is  seriously disabled and  also  loses  his\r\n\r\nsight,  even  the  increased amount  of  compensation\r\n\r\nwould not adequately compensate him. Therefore, I  am\r\n\r\nof  the  opinion  that  though the  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nquantum  of compensation is one aspect of the matter,\r\n\r\nthe  more  important  point  is  to  try  to  prevent\r\n\r\nindustrial accidents or reduce their number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics given by the Minister who\r\n\r\nspoke  about the increase in the number of industrial\r\n\r\naccidents  without informing us of  the  measures  to\r\n\r\nremedy the situation, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeel   that  there  is  some  defect  in  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nAccording  to the statistical report, in 1970  there\r\n\r\nwere  9,682  cases of industrial accidents.  In  the\r\n\r\nfirst  seven months of this year, there have already\r\n\r\nbeen  5,966  cases of industrial accidents.  Judging\r\n\r\nfrom  this trend, by the end of this year the number\r\n\r\nmay  well exceed 10,000. If there are no appropriate\r\n\r\nsafety  measures  to  prevent  this  situation  from\r\n\r\ndeveloping  further,  then every  year  we  will  be\r\n\r\nlosing tens of thousands of workers in this way.  If\r\n\r\nthis trend were to continue, then after eight or  10\r\n\r\nyears many of our factories might have to close down\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the acute shortage of skilled  workers.\r\n\r\nThe   Social  Welfare  Department  and   our   other\r\n\r\nresources might also be heavily taxed because of the\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of disabled persons. This can\r\n\r\nbe  said  to  be  a  great burden  on  our  country.\r\n\r\nIndustrial  accidents  will  affect  not  only   our\r\n\r\nnational   economic  life,  but  also   our   social\r\n\r\nsecurity. To provide for safeguards for our  workers\r\n\r\nand   to  maintain  our  continued  prosperity   and\r\n\r\nnational progress, we should take active measures to\r\n\r\nprevent  or  to  reduce  the  number  of  industrial\r\n\r\naccidents. This is the basic solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are now actively promoting `the policy of\r\n\r\nrapid industrialisation. We are also engaged in full-scale  urban  renewal schemes, and, in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  the  building industry is also  prospering.\r\n\r\nAll this indicates prosperity and progress. However,\r\n\r\nit cannot be denied that this also has brought about\r\n\r\nmany  more  industrial  accidents.  This  is  mainly\r\n\r\nbecause  many  businessmen  in  the  industrial  and\r\n\r\ncommercial  sectors, in order to meet  the  pressing\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the hour, resort to economising on  their\r\n\r\nbudgets   and   instituting   makeshift   provisions\r\n\r\nwherever  possible, and neglect  to  provide  safety\r\n\r\nmeasures  for  their workers. In addition  to  this,\r\n\r\nthere is a shortage of skilled workers, thus leading\r\n\r\nto   frequent  industrial  accidents.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  need  is to enforce stringent  provisions\r\n\r\nstipulating   that   all  factories   and   building\r\n\r\ncontractors should provide adequate safety  measures\r\n\r\nand facilities for their workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  the  Government should send out  inspectors  to\r\n\r\nmake  regular checks. Furthermore, there  should  be\r\n\r\nactive  training of technical personnel to  shoulder\r\n\r\nthe  task  of  supervision. Only with this  sort  of\r\n\r\nprecautionary measures may we reduce, if not  avoid,\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents. If we do not  take  immediate\r\n\r\nmeasures to provide for stringent measures to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  numerous dangers faced by the workers-hut allow\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents to happen now  and  then,  our\r\n\r\ncountry will suffer great losses. As we all know, we\r\n\r\ndo  not  have any natural resources and the  capital\r\n\r\nfor   nation   building  is  not   just   our   good\r\n\r\ngeographical position. Our main asset is  our  human\r\n\r\nresources and our wisdom. So we should try  to  make\r\n\r\nfull  use of our human resources and use our  wisdom\r\n\r\nwell  to  treasure, preserve and protect our limited\r\n\r\nhuman  resources.  Only then  can  our  country  and\r\n\r\nsociety continue to progress and prosper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very much\r\n\r\ncheered  by  the keen interest shown by  Members  on\r\n\r\nthis  subject  of workmen's compensation.

Some\r\n\r\nof   its   suggestions   have   been   accepted   and\r\n\r\nincorporated  in  the present amendment  Bill,  while\r\n\r\nothers  for  various reasons have not been  accepted.\r\n\r\nAnd  what Members have raised today refers mainly  to\r\n\r\nthose suggestions that have not been accepted by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point has been made that in clause 6 - section 8\r\n\r\n(3) (a) - anomalies may arise and the dependants of a\r\n\r\ndeceased  workman may be better off than those  of  a\r\n\r\npermanently  and  totally  incapacitated  workman.  I\r\n\r\nthink Members have been informed that to prevent this\r\n\r\nfrom  happening, we have decided that  a  proviso  be\r\n\r\nadded  to  section  8  (3) (a)  which  will  read  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where permanent total incapacity results from the\r\n\r\ninjury, the amount of compensation shall be -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  (a) in  the case of a workman who is eighteen years\r\n\r\n      of age and above at the time of the accident, a\r\n\r\n      lump sum of twenty-eight thousand eight hundred\r\n\r\n      dollars  or  equal  to sixty months'  earnings,\r\n\r\n      whichever is the less:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Provided   that  the  amount  of   compensation\r\n\r\n      payable  shall not be less than the  amount  to\r\n\r\n      which   his  dependants,  assuming  that   such\r\n\r\n      dependants  exist, would be entitled  if  death\r\n\r\n      had resulted from the injury.'\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>I think this will take care of the Member's concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention has also been made of clause 15 relating to\r\n\r\namendment  of section 26 (2) of the Act.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  a  need to amend  this  section  as\r\n\r\nproposed, because any workman who thinks that he  has\r\n\r\nbeen  dismissed after objecting to an attempt by  his\r\n\r\nemployer  to  avoid  liability  could  be  adequately\r\n\r\nlooked  after  by  invoking  the  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations  Act, in particular  subsection\r\n\r\n(2) of section 35 thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention has also been made of clause 17 relating to\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  to  the First Schedule  of  the  Act.\r\n\r\nAgain.  I  think we cannot agree that the  amount  of\r\n\r\ncompensation payable to cases of hand injuries should\r\n\r\nbe governed by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  consideration  whether the  hand  is  habitually\r\n\r\nused.  The reasons are: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The adoption of a single\r\n\r\nscale  makes for smooth administration.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In all occupations, workers are required to use and do use\r\n\r\nboth   their  hands,  although  there  may  be   some\r\n\r\ndifference in the degree of such use between one hand\r\n\r\nand the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be very difficult in practice to determine\r\n\r\nwhich  hand  is more habitually used than the  other,\r\n\r\nand   disputes   are   bound  to   arise   over   the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of what is meant by \"habitually used\".\r\n\r\nIt  will  be better if we leave this matter to  those\r\n\r\nwho are more qualified. For example, medical officers\r\n\r\ncan  prescribe a higher percentage of award in favour\r\n\r\nof  the  worker. In any case, the suggested amendment\r\n\r\ncan  only  benefit a few workers who are employed  in\r\n\r\noccupations  where there is clear evidence  that  one\r\n\r\nhand is more habitually used than the other. I do not\r\n\r\nthink that at this stage it is necessary to make that\r\n\r\nkind of amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang has suggested that there\r\n\r\nshould be yearly medical examinations. First of  all,\r\n\r\nI  cannot see in what way yearly medical examinations\r\n\r\ncan   prevent  accidents  from  happening.  Accidents\r\n\r\nsimply  happen,  whether the  workmen  are  medically\r\n\r\nexamined  yearly  or not. What is needed  is  a  more\r\n\r\nconcerted effort to instil safety consciousness  into\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and the employers. Medical examinations\r\n\r\ncan   be  useful  only  in  certain  industries,  for\r\n\r\nexample, the petroleum and chemical industries, where\r\n\r\noccupational diseases can be detected in their  early\r\n\r\nstages. The provision of yearly or periodical medical\r\n\r\nexaminations   is  feasible  only   in   the   bigger\r\n\r\nindustries   or  establishments.  The   reasons   are\r\n\r\nobvious.  Not all employers can afford to offer  such\r\n\r\nfacilities to their workmen and occupational diseases\r\n\r\nare not found in all industries.\r\n\r\nSeveral Members have dwelt on the point of compulsory\r\n\r\ninsurance  and  have expressed the fear  that  it  is\r\n\r\npossible that the insurance companies may disclaim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir liability because of some fault  in  the\r\n\r\ninsurance  policy  taken  up  by  the  employer.  The\r\n\r\nWorkmen's  Compensation Act has been in force  for  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of years and, to my knowledge, no cases  have\r\n\r\nyet  been reported of insurance companies disclaiming\r\n\r\ntheir  liability. Nevertheless, the  point  has  been\r\n\r\nmade  and we will keep that in mind. Should cases  of\r\n\r\nthis nature happen, we shall reconsider the provision\r\n\r\nof compulsory insurance and take appropriate steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I pointed out earlier, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlegislative  measures  alone cannot  bring  down  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  industrial  accidents,  unless  there  is\r\n\r\nstrict   enforcement   of   the   law   and   greater\r\n\r\nconsciousness  of industrial safety  among  employers\r\n\r\nand  employees. In this respect, 1 think the National\r\n\r\nTrades  Union  Congress and the Singapore  Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation   as   well   as   other   public-spirited\r\n\r\nindividuals  can play a part in promoting  industrial\r\n\r\nsafety by giving the subject more publicity, so  that\r\n\r\nthe losses both to the economy of the country and the\r\n\r\nworkers  can  be better appreciated. As  far  as  the\r\n\r\nLabour Ministry is concerned, there is no doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe  Factory Inspectorate, as it is now, is not  only\r\n\r\nunderstaffed  but  also  inexperienced.   Take,   for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  construction  industry.  It  has  the\r\n\r\nhighest  number of fatal accident cases, and  yet  in\r\n\r\nour  Factory Inspectorate there is not a single civil\r\n\r\nengineer. We have, instead, mechanical engineers.  To\r\n\r\nbring  down  the  rate  of industrial  accidents  may\r\n\r\nrequire  effort  on  the  part  of  everybody  -  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the employers and the employees. When the\r\n\r\nFactories Act has been tightened up and strengthened,\r\n\r\nwe  will  carry out an industrial safety campaign  to\r\n\r\ndrive the lesson home, and follow it up thereafter by\r\n\r\nstrict enforcement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I could\r\n\r\nhardly  agree  more  with the Minister  that  medical\r\n\r\nexaminations would not prevent industrial  accidents,\r\n\r\nbut  what  I  did  suggest was  that  if  there  were\r\n\r\nperiodical medical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexaminations - whether yearly, biyearly or  bi-yearly\r\n\r\nthere   could   be  early  detection  of   industrial\r\n\r\ndiseases. That was my suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise is that the\r\n\r\nMinister has not yet answered whether he would  agree\r\n\r\nto  widen  the  scope  of workmen's  compensation  to\r\n\r\ninclude  mental  illnesses  which  are  caused  by  a\r\n\r\nperson's employment. The Minister is silent about it.\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether he is avoiding the issue now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to raise is that at the\r\n\r\npresent moment the Workmen's Compensation Section  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Labour deals only with claims.  When\r\n\r\ninsurance  is introduced, it will have to see  to  it\r\n\r\nthat  employers  do really insure their  workers.  In\r\n\r\nthis case, the Workmen's Compensation Section must be\r\n\r\nstrengthened.  The  Factory  Inspectorate  has   been\r\n\r\nstrengthened. So I hope the Minister for Labour  will\r\n\r\nnot forget to look into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I certainly agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  Member  for  Kallang  that  the  Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation  Section should be  strengthened.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure that when this matter comes up before this House\r\n\r\nagain  in the next budget, we can get the support  of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Kallang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, about the mental cases I think that\r\n\r\nrequires further consideration and consultation  with\r\n\r\nthe  medical authorities. I am not saying that I will\r\n\r\nnot  agree  to include mental illness in  the  Second\r\n\r\nSchedule,  but I think this subject requires  further\r\n\r\nconsideration before a decision is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  also  see to it  that  the  Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation  Section in the Ministry  of  Labour  is\r\n\r\nheaded  by  someone  who is more qualified.  Now  the\r\n\r\nsection deals only with claims, its functions will be\r\n\r\nbroadened  and  definitely we need a  man  of  higher\r\n\r\ncalibre  to  look after this section.  I  assure  the\r\n\r\nMinister that I will raise this subject again at  the\r\n\r\nright time during the budget debate if it is not done\r\n\r\nbetween now and then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Workmen's Compensation\r\n\r\nSection  works  in the dark. 1 know  of  cases  where\r\n\r\nworkers  do not know why they were or why  they  were\r\n\r\nnot given compensation. Therefore, there should be  a\r\n\r\nWorkmen's Compensation Board on which the workers can\r\n\r\nbe  represented at hearings, inquiries and so  on.

Singapore\r\n\r\naccepted the Convention in March 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the Tokyo Convention covers acts which\r\n\r\njeopardize the safety of an aircraft or of persons or\r\n\r\nproperty  therein or which jeopardize good order  and\r\n\r\ndiscipline  on  board.  The Convention  requires  any\r\n\r\nmember  State in which a hijacked aircraft lands  to,\r\n\r\nfirstly, take appropriate measures to return  control\r\n\r\nof  the aircraft, crew and passengers to the aircraft\r\n\r\ncommander,  and, secondly, permit onward movement  of\r\n\r\nthe aircraft,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrew and passengers as soon as practicable. Under the\r\n\r\nConvention  the  State  iii  which  the  aircraft  is\r\n\r\nregistered  can exercise jurisdiction  over  offences\r\n\r\nand acts committed on board the aircraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a civil aviation centre and with a view to\r\n\r\ndeterring  aircraft  hijacking, it  is  obvious  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  take appropriate measures  against\r\n\r\nall  kinds  of unlawful acts over civil  aircraft  in\r\n\r\nflight.  Accession  to the Convention,  while  not  a\r\n\r\ncomplete solution to hijacking, will help reduce some\r\n\r\nof the risks which result from such acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential features of the Bill may be summarised\r\n\r\nas follows. The criminal law of Singapore is extended\r\n\r\nto acts and omissions taking place on board Singapore-controlled   aircraft   while   in   flight   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore. Courts in Singapore will have power to try\r\n\r\noffences  committed  on board a  Singapore-controlled\r\n\r\naircraft in flight outside Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill gives wide powers to the commander of an\r\n\r\naircraft to deal with persons who commit or are about\r\n\r\nto  commit offences on board the aircraft. There  are\r\n\r\nprovisions which deal with the taking of evidence  in\r\n\r\nconnection  with  offences  committed  on  board   an\r\n\r\naircraft.   The   Minister  is  empowered   to   make\r\n\r\nregulations  for carrying out the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nTokyo Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.--[Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK OF SINGAPORE BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in September last year I\r\n\r\nannounced that Government had decided to convert  the\r\n\r\nPost Office Savings Bank into a statutory corporation\r\n\r\nto  give  the Bank greater freedom of action  and  to\r\n\r\nprovide  more  efficient service to its  half-million\r\n\r\ndepositors. This Bill seeks to convert the Bank  into\r\n\r\na statutory corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of being an independent statutory\r\n\r\nboard  are  obvious.  Management  will  have  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility in administration, recruitment of  staff,\r\n\r\nbusiness operations and promotional programmes.  With\r\n\r\nfinancial   autonomy  the  Bank  will  be   able   to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate its effectiveness. Calculations show that\r\n\r\nthe  Bank  can  be self-supporting and  viable  as  a\r\n\r\nstatutory corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now summarise the principal provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill.  The  main objects of the Bank are  to  provide\r\n\r\nmeans  for  the  deposit of savings and  to  mobilise\r\n\r\ndomestic savings for public development. The Bank  is\r\n\r\nempowered  to  operate time deposit accounts  and  to\r\n\r\nlend money to its depositors, vide clauses 5 (a)  and\r\n\r\n(b) of the Bill. These are new facilities and will no\r\n\r\ndoubt be welcomed by the depositors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of the Bank will be vested in a Board\r\n\r\nof  Directors  consisting of between five  and  eight\r\n\r\nmembers,  all of whom, including its Chairman,  shall\r\n\r\nbe appointed by the Minister. There is also provision\r\n\r\nunder  clause  17 for the appointment  of  a  General\r\n\r\nManager who shall be the chief executive of the Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important point is that Government will continue\r\n\r\nto  guarantee the repayment of deposits and interest.\r\n\r\nThis  is  provided for in clause 26.  The  public  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  assured  of complete  security  for  their\r\n\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is provision for the creation of a general\r\n\r\nreserve  fund  from the Bank's surplus revenues.  The\r\n\r\nBank may also invest in such stocks and securities as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance may, from  time  to  time,\r\n\r\napprove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude with a\r\n\r\nbrief review of the past\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  future prospects of the Bank. When we took  over\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the Bank from Kuala Lumpur in 1966,  five\r\n\r\nyears ago, there were only 250,000 depositors and $37\r\n\r\nmillion in deposits. As at 30th September this  year,\r\n\r\nthere  were  548,492 depositors  and  the  amount  of\r\n\r\ndeposits   was  $85.83  million.  Credit   for   this\r\n\r\nexcellent   achievement  must  go  to  the   Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee appointed in 1968, to the staff, and to the\r\n\r\nstrong  support from the public, including our school\r\n\r\nchildren. I must add that the interest of 4 per  cent\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to be exempt from income  tax!  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident    that,   as   an   autonomous   statutory\r\n\r\ncorporation, the Post Office Savings Bank will become\r\n\r\nan  even  greater financial institution  than  it  is\r\n\r\ntoday,  and  I  have no doubt that  the  public  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to give their fullest support to the Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI welcome the amendment Bill. The Post Office Savings\r\n\r\nBank  of  Singapore  has  played  a  great  part   in\r\n\r\nmobilising   domestic  savings  among   the   public,\r\n\r\nparticularly in promoting the saving habit among  the\r\n\r\nschool  children  in Singapore. As a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious incentives offered by the Post Office Savings\r\n\r\nBank,  considerable interest among our  students  has\r\n\r\nbeen stimulated. The number of students participating\r\n\r\nin  the Savings Bank programme has increased over the\r\n\r\nyears.   Cultivating  the  saving  habit  among   our\r\n\r\nchildren  and young citizens is a great step forward.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, I would like to mention a case in\r\n\r\npoint. Last year a competition for the highest number\r\n\r\nof  new depositors with the Post Office Savings  Bank\r\n\r\nwas  held  among our school children.  The  Mm  Chung\r\n\r\nSchool (Naval Base Public Chinese School), which is a\r\n\r\nprimary school in my constituency, has a small school\r\n\r\nenrolment  but it won the competition.  This  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, a credit to Sembawang constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has stated just now\r\n\r\nthat  the aim of this Bill is to make the Post Office\r\n\r\nSavings Bank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinancially  viable and autonomous and this  move  to\r\n\r\nconvert  it into a statutory body will make  it  more\r\n\r\neffective  and  efficient. It is also  my  hope  that\r\n\r\nafter  its  conversion into a corporation,  the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice   Savings  Bank  will  be  capable  of  better\r\n\r\nperformance,   particularly  in  promoting   domestic\r\n\r\nsavings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, the Post Office Savings\r\n\r\nBank  has been giving encouragement to depositors  by\r\n\r\nway  of  allowing  those with $500  or  more  in  the\r\n\r\nsavings bank to take part in lucky draws. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  principle this is a good way  to  encourage\r\n\r\nsaving among members of the public so that they  will\r\n\r\nput  more  money into the Post Office  Savings  Bank.\r\n\r\nHowever, in respect of the detailed workings  of  the\r\n\r\nlucky   draw,   I  feel  that  there  is   room   for\r\n\r\nimprovement.  This lucky draw has been  so  organised\r\n\r\nthat  a  depositor must personally collect the coupon\r\n\r\nfrom  the Post Office Savings Bank. In my view,  this\r\n\r\nwill   cause   considerable  inconvenience   to   the\r\n\r\ndepositors,  particularly those who are absent-minded\r\n\r\nor  who are too busy to go and collect the coupon.  I\r\n\r\nwould, therefore, like to suggest to the Minister  to\r\n\r\norganise  a better system for the lucky draw,  if  at\r\n\r\nall a lucky draw is to be held next year. That is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  let those with $500 or more in the savings bank\r\n\r\nbe  given a coupon automatically to take part in  the\r\n\r\nlucky  draw  instead of their having  to  collect  it\r\n\r\npersonally.  In this way, all those who are  eligible\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to participate in the lucky  draw.  By\r\n\r\nhaving  coupons sent to them by post, they will  thus\r\n\r\nhave the opportunity to take part in a lucky draw. If\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament do take part  in  this  lucky\r\n\r\ndraw, they will have an opportunity to win a prize!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Sembawang has spoken in full  support\r\n\r\nof  the  decision to convert the Post Office  Savings\r\n\r\nBank  into  a statutory corporation. He has suggested\r\n\r\nthat  if  there are going to be lucky  draws  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  the  depositors  need  not  personally  present\r\n\r\nthemselves  at  the post office to  get  the  lottery\r\n\r\ntickets. I must assume that the Member has not as yet\r\n\r\nparticipated in the lucky draw, because if he had, he\r\n\r\nwould  have known the reason why a depositor  has  to\r\n\r\nmake  a personal application. It is because the staff\r\n\r\nwill have to see that the particular person does have\r\n\r\nat  least $500 in the Post Office Savings Bank.  When\r\n\r\nissuing  the lottery ticket, the staff will stamp  on\r\n\r\nthe  pass book itself that such and such a lucky draw\r\n\r\nticket  has been given to the depositor. That is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why it is necessary for a depositor  to  call\r\n\r\npersonally  and present his passbook.  Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  possible really to send a  lucky  draw\r\n\r\nticket by post and for the depositor to receive it at\r\n\r\nthe  other end without his having to turn up  at  the\r\n\r\npost office himself. I can assure him that there will\r\n\r\nbe  lucky  draws  for 1972 and we do  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang will be one of the  depositors\r\n\r\nwho  will qualify for the lucky draw tickets and thus\r\n\r\nwin a prize!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL STADIUM CORPORATION BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill\r\n\r\nbe now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Sports Complex at Kallang at present\r\n\r\nunder  construction,  when  completed,  will  provide\r\n\r\ncomprehensive   facilities   for   a    variety    of\r\n\r\nrequirements    of    international    games     with\r\n\r\nsophistication   and  standards   required   of   the\r\n\r\nOlympics.

The\r\n\r\nmain  stadium will be completed towards  the  end  of\r\n\r\n1972  and will constitute the first phase. The  other\r\n\r\nfeatures  of  the complex will be the  second  phase,\r\n\r\npreliminary work on which has begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design and construction of the first phase has\r\n\r\nbeen done entirely by the Public Works Department  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  a  Singapore contractor.  The  second\r\n\r\nphase  is being undertaken by Messrs Kenzo Tange  and\r\n\r\nUrtec,  headed  by the world-renowned  architect  and\r\n\r\nplanner,  Professor  Tange.  The  whole  complex   is\r\n\r\nexpected  to be completed by early 1975. The  complex\r\n\r\nis  located on State land. Constructional  costs  are\r\n\r\nexpected to be in the region of S$60 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main and covered stadium, essentially catering\r\n\r\nfor sports, will be multipurpose. The main stadium is\r\n\r\nalso  planned  to  be used for parades,  rallies  and\r\n\r\nconcerts. The covered stadium will also be  used  for\r\n\r\nexhibitions,  forums,  etc.,  besides  a  variety  of\r\n\r\nindoor sports requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third phase will be the development of\r\n\r\nfacilities  in  the  vicinity for multi-storeyed  car\r\n\r\nparks and a mass transportation system to provide for\r\n\r\neasier  and quicker access to the complex from  other\r\n\r\nparts of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main stadium will also provide for reception and\r\n\r\nrefreshment   areas,  especially  shopping   arcades,\r\n\r\noffices  for sports organisations, accommodation  for\r\n\r\ncentralised  training  and indoor  sports  facilities\r\n\r\nlike mini golf, driving ranges, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally intended that the National Sports\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board  would also be responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nKallang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSports  Complex.  However, since the  Board  will  be\r\n\r\npreoccupied  with  its many and varied  functions  to\r\n\r\nactually  promote  and develop sports  standards  and\r\n\r\npopularity  in  Singapore, it is now considered  that\r\n\r\nthe  Sports  Complex at Kallang should be  separately\r\n\r\nand  efficiently managed, as far as possible,  as  an\r\n\r\neconomically   viable  concept.   It   is,   however,\r\n\r\nessential to ensure that not only are the stadium and\r\n\r\nrelated facilities utilised, but also that they  will\r\n\r\nfully  help  in the promotion of sports. There  will,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  be  necessity  for  correlation  and  co-ordination  of  the policies of the  National  Sports\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board  and  the proposed  National  Sports\r\n\r\nCorporation  to  see that, as far as  possible,  they\r\n\r\ncomplement each other in the best interests of sports\r\n\r\npromotion  in Singapore. In fact, it is the intention\r\n\r\nto  provide  that  a  member of the  National  Sports\r\n\r\nPromotion Board will serve on the Board of Management\r\n\r\nof the proposed National Stadium Corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Stadium Corporation will look after all\r\n\r\nthe  facilities  in  the National Sports  Complex  at\r\n\r\nKallang.  The  monies required for their  realisation\r\n\r\nwill,  in the first instance, be obtained from grants\r\n\r\nmade  by Singapore Pools (Private) Limited from their\r\n\r\nannual  profits. However, if and when this source  of\r\n\r\nfinancing  is  not adequate, it will be possible  for\r\n\r\nthe  Corporation to obtain loans on a  long-term  and\r\n\r\nlow-interest basis from the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for the Minister to appoint eight\r\n\r\npersons  to  form  the  Corporation.  They  will   be\r\n\r\nassisted  in  their  day-to-day  operations   by   an\r\n\r\nexecutive staff. The members of the Corporation  will\r\n\r\nbe  required to prepare and execute proposals for the\r\n\r\nconstruction and management of the main  stadium  and\r\n\r\nother  stadium and sports facilities in  the  Kallang\r\n\r\nSports Complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In furtherance of this objective, the Bill provides\r\n\r\nfor  the  Corporation to enter into contracts,  raise\r\n\r\nfunds, receive donations and contributions and  other\r\n\r\nforms  of aid from all lawful sources, and to  borrow\r\n\r\nmoney  either  from the Government or  other  sources\r\n\r\napproved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister.

Today,   countries\r\n\r\nthroughout  the world, whether big or  small,  attach\r\n\r\ngreat importance to sports and are actively promoting\r\n\r\nthem  so  that  they have become even  more  popular.\r\n\r\nEspecially  in this fast-changing society where  life\r\n\r\nis both busy and tense, sports have an important role\r\n\r\nto  play in promoting health and harmonizing the mind\r\n\r\nand the body. In addition to this,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsports   also   play  an  important   role   in   the\r\n\r\ninternational  political arena.  They  are  the  main\r\n\r\nbridge  to  the promotion of international friendship\r\n\r\nand understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been very active in promoting and\r\n\r\npopularising  sports activities.  Particularly  today\r\n\r\nwhen  we  are  an  independent, sovereign  and  young\r\n\r\ndeveloping  country,  we have  been  behind  none  in\r\n\r\nsports  activities.  This  is  in  keeping  with  our\r\n\r\nforeign  policy  of  \"Making more friends  and  fewer\r\n\r\nenemies\",  so as to establish friendship and  promote\r\n\r\ngood  relations with other countries.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, the great majority of our population is made up\r\n\r\nof  youths who are our future successors and who must\r\n\r\nhave  the  prerequisites  of  health  and  ruggedness\r\n\r\nbefore   they   can  shoulder  the  heavy   task   of\r\n\r\nnationhood. Therefore, in order to meet  the  aim  of\r\n\r\nour  Government to build a rugged \"Society, a big and\r\n\r\nwell-equipped national stadium is necessary.  Equally\r\n\r\nimportant is the need to set up a Corporation to take\r\n\r\nfull charge of the planning, building and managing of\r\n\r\nsuch  a big sports complex. Therefore, I welcome  the\r\n\r\npresentation of this Bill. However, I would  like  to\r\n\r\ngive two points of view for consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as revealed by the authorities concerned,\r\n\r\nthe National Sports Complex is quite a large complex;\r\n\r\nhence the cost of its maintenance and operation  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  considerable. In clause  15  of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nSingapore Pools (Private) Limited and grants  in  aid\r\n\r\nof  the  Government are included as among the sources\r\n\r\nof   finance.  I  would  like  to  stress  here   the\r\n\r\nimportance  of Government financial aids.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nthe  Sports Complex will be like the National Theatre\r\n\r\nand  be  faced with the same problem. Because without\r\n\r\nGovernment  aid, the National Theatre,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsurvive on a \"self-supporting\" basis, has to  seek  a\r\n\r\nsolution  by  living on rentals and hire  fees,  thus\r\n\r\nmeeting with diverse difficulties while promoting art\r\n\r\nin  our country. In this way, civic art organisations\r\n\r\nare also not benefited. What we are worried about  is\r\n\r\nthat  if  there is no Government financial  aid,  the\r\n\r\nNational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStadium  Corporation,  in order  to  meet  the  large\r\n\r\namount  of  recurrent expenditure, will similarly  be\r\n\r\nforced  to obtain money from civic organisations  and\r\n\r\nspectators  in  the  last resort.  Then  it  will  be\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the  high ideal and  aim  of  promoting\r\n\r\nsports in our country by building the National Sports\r\n\r\nStadium Complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with Government's active encouragement and\r\n\r\npromotional efforts, sports activities in our country\r\n\r\ncan  be said to be quite vigorous. However, it is sad\r\n\r\nto  note that the existing number of sports fields is\r\n\r\nrather  inadequate. Some of these are even on private\r\n\r\nproperty.  Even when the National Sports  Complex  is\r\n\r\ncompleted, these existing grounds still deserve to be\r\n\r\npreserved  and utilized. Therefore, I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nauthorities   concerned  will,   wherever   possible,\r\n\r\npreserve  these existing sports grounds and,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, for the safety of the users and members of\r\n\r\nthe  public, try to make the owners of these  grounds\r\n\r\nimprove the safety precautions therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nexpress my full support for this Bill. The setting up\r\n\r\nof  the  National Sports Complex will provide perfect\r\n\r\nfacilities  for sports in our country.  The  National\r\n\r\nStadium  Corporation  is  given  the  main  task   of\r\n\r\nmanaging  and administering the Sports Complex.  This\r\n\r\nis a very important task. Undoubtedly, the setting up\r\n\r\nof  the  National Stadium symbolises  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nsports  in Singapore have entered a new era and  have\r\n\r\nmarched  a  step  forward. It is a milestone  in  our\r\n\r\nsports  history. According to the Minister, a sum  of\r\n\r\n$60 million will be involved in the setting up of the\r\n\r\nNational Sports Complex. This is a huge sum of money.\r\n\r\nSince  we have mobilised such a large amount of money\r\n\r\nand have put out efforts to build a sports complex, I\r\n\r\nhope  we  will  have  better  means  of  raising  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  our  sports and  also  of  popularising\r\n\r\nsports  among our people so that they may be stronger\r\n\r\nand more healthy and so serve our country better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill sets out the functions of the National\r\n\r\nStadium  Corporation, one of which is  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nstandard of sports in our country. In this respect, I\r\n\r\nam   of  the  view  that  we  should  pay  particular\r\n\r\nattention to the following two tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is about the setting up of a sports fund.\r\n\r\nAs  we  all know, in the past few years we have  been\r\n\r\nvery active in sports. We have tried our best to take\r\n\r\npart  in  various  regional and international  sports\r\n\r\ntournaments.  However, the common  problem  faced  by\r\n\r\npeople  in  sports circles is the raising  of  funds.\r\n\r\nTherefore, whenever a tournament is to be held  on  a\r\n\r\nlarge  scale,  it is necessary for people  in  sports\r\n\r\ncircles to try their best to raise funds to meet  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure. I remember some members of our  national\r\n\r\nteams were not given the opportunity to take part  in\r\n\r\ninternational  or  regional sports meets  because  of\r\n\r\nlack  of funds. Therefore, we must try to get  enough\r\n\r\nmoney for the sports fund so as to be able to develop\r\n\r\nsports  in  our country. I hope the Corporation  will\r\n\r\npay  special  attention to the  question  of  raising\r\n\r\nfunds   to  supplement  the  National  Stadium  Fund,\r\n\r\nwhether  from  Government  or  other  sources.   With\r\n\r\nadequate  funds,  we  will  be  able  to  train   our\r\n\r\nsportsmen and sportswomen so that they can compete in\r\n\r\nthe  international and regional sports arena and also\r\n\r\nraise our standard of sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Corporation should\r\n\r\nalso  pay  attention  to  the provision  of  engaging\r\n\r\ncapable sports coaches in all fields and have regular\r\n\r\nperiods of training for our national teams.

I would  like  to\r\n\r\nassure  him in particular and other Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse who are interested in sports that they need not\r\n\r\nworry  about  sports  and  financial  aid  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In fact, the Government  has  gone  into\r\n\r\nsports  activities one hundred per  cent.  This  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the  National Stadium  Corporation  to\r\n\r\napproach  the Government for loans if it is necessary\r\n\r\nto help the Corporation financially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question of safety precautions raised\r\n\r\nby the Member, this has always been borne in mind not\r\n\r\nonly by the National Stadium Corporation but also  by\r\n\r\nthe  National  Sports Promotion  Board.  And  we  are\r\n\r\nlooking  into this very actively and Members  can  be\r\n\r\nassured that precautionary measures will be taken for\r\n\r\nthe  safety of sportsmen and sportswomen and also for\r\n\r\nthe spectators in the sports complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang raised two points - to\r\n\r\nraise the standard of sports and to popularise sports\r\n\r\namong  the  masses. On the question  of  raising  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of sports, this has been going on  for  the\r\n\r\nlast  three or four years. We are always looking into\r\n\r\nor trying our best to raise the standard of sports in\r\n\r\nSingapore. In fact, when I answered a Question of one\r\n\r\nMember  earlier, I said that the Singapore  Badminton\r\n\r\nAssociation  has  already  a  scheme  by  which   the\r\n\r\nstandard  of badminton is going to be improved.  Many\r\n\r\nother sports organisations will be doing likewise. So\r\n\r\nthe Member need not worry about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the popularisation of sports among the masses,\r\n\r\nsports activities will be carried out at constituency\r\n\r\nlevel next year.

I  hope\r\n\r\nevery Member of Parliament will encourage all sports\r\n\r\norganisations in their constituencies to  participate\r\n\r\nin these competitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of a sports fund, clause 15 of the\r\n\r\nNational  Stadium Corporation Bill provides that  the\r\n\r\nCorporation will actively promote fund raising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of capable coaches, here again the\r\n\r\nN.S.P.B, has always been looking into  it.  We  have\r\n\r\nbrought  in one or two capable coaches from  overseas\r\n\r\nto train our sportsmen and sportswomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Mountbatten as\r\n\r\nto  the amount of fees to be paid to Professor  Tange\r\n\r\nfor  the  second phase of the Sports  Complex,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid I cannot tell the Member offhand.

This\r\n\r\namendment  is  necessary in view of the  considerable\r\n\r\nincrease  in the number of documents to be sealed  by\r\n\r\nthe   Housing   and  Development  Board   since   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of the home ownership  scheme  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.

The  Bill, if passed, will enable  not  only\r\n\r\nJudges  who retire at the age of 65 or 65X- years  to\r\n\r\nbe  re-employed, but also those who retire or  resign\r\n\r\nbefore  attaining  65 years. This provision  will  be\r\n\r\ninvoked  only  when it is necessary and,  of  course,\r\n\r\nonly  if  the  Judge is himself willing to  serve.  A\r\n\r\nformer  Judge could therefore be called upon to  help\r\n\r\nout at any time as, for example, when a serving Judge\r\n\r\nis  ill for a considerable time, or is expected to be\r\n\r\nabsent for several months for any cause, or if it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  maintain  the  present  complement  of\r\n\r\nJudges  with experience when one of them is  required\r\n\r\nto  retire  by  reason of age. This is  in  fact  the\r\n\r\nposition  with  regard  to  one  senior  Judge  whose\r\n\r\nextended term of office expires in November this year\r\n\r\nwhen  he  will  attain the age of 65  years  and  six\r\n\r\nmonths. As there are now only six Judges, apart  from\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Justice, and the maintenance of  at  least\r\n\r\nthis  number is desirable, it would seem  a  pity  to\r\n\r\nlose  the experience that this retiring senior  Judge\r\n\r\nrepresents so long as he is in good health and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwilling   to   serve  in  that  capacity  beyond   his\r\n\r\ncompulsory retiring age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is worth noting that the retiring age for\r\n\r\nJudges  of the Supreme Court varies in other countries\r\n\r\nfrom  65  years  in India to 75 years in  England  and\r\n\r\nCanada.  In  Australia, they are  appointed  for  life\r\n\r\nwhile  in  the  United  States  there  is  no  age  of\r\n\r\nretirement,  but on reaching the age of 70  a  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt  Judge who has served 10 consecutive  years  may\r\n\r\nrequest  release from active duty. It is  not  thought\r\n\r\nnecessary  or desirable to raise the present  retiring\r\n\r\nage  of Judges in Singapore as there would be some who\r\n\r\nwish  to  retire at the age of 65 years, and  we  feel\r\n\r\nthat  they should not be prevented from so doing. This\r\n\r\nBill,  therefore,  has the merit of not  altering  the\r\n\r\npresent retiring age of our Judges for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  would prefer to retire at the age  of  65,\r\n\r\nwhile  at  the  same  time it enables  those  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to serve for specific periods after reaching\r\n\r\nretiring age to help out whenever there is a need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An existing provision in the Constitution, namely\r\n\r\nclause (2) of Article 52B, enables \"a person qualified\r\n\r\nfor  appointment as a Judge of the Supreme  Court\"  to\r\n\r\nsit as a Judge of that Court for a specific period and\r\n\r\nthere is in fact one such Judge who has been appointed\r\n\r\nunder  this provision. The amendment now proposed  has\r\n\r\nbeen  conveniently incorporated in that  provision  so\r\n\r\nthat  a  person  so  qualified for  appointment  or  a\r\n\r\nretired Judge of the Supreme Court who is recalled  to\r\n\r\nserve  under  the new provision will hold  office  for\r\n\r\nsuch period or periods as the President, acting on the\r\n\r\nadvice of the Prime Minister, directs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REVISED EDITIONS OF THE LAWS (ANNUAL SUPPLEMENTS)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

The rule is to the\r\n\r\neffect  that each Annual Supplement shall contain  all\r\n\r\nthe  Acts passed between 1st January and 31st December\r\n\r\nof  the  year immediately preceding the date of issue.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the 1970 Revised Edition of Acts, an  eight-volume  work  containing  the Statutes  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nincludes  the Acts passed by Parliament in 1970  other\r\n\r\nthan  14 Acts passed on the 30th December, 1970, which\r\n\r\nwere  not  brought into operation in  1970.  The  1970\r\n\r\nAnnual Supplement to be issued this year is to contain\r\n\r\nall the Acts so omitted from the 1970 Revised Edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill can, therefore, be said to be necessitated\r\n\r\nby  the  situation created by the 1970 Revised Edition\r\n\r\nof  Acts  which absorbed the first 48 of the  62  Acts\r\n\r\npassed  in  1970 but not the Acts numbered  49  to  62\r\n\r\nwhich  were passed on 30th December last year.
