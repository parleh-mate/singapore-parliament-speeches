There  was,  however, a  proviso  that  an\r\n\r\nequivalent  exemption from tax must be granted  by\r\n\r\nthe country under reference to persons resident in\r\n\r\nSingapore or the United Kingdom. As exemption from\r\n\r\nItalian income tax conferred on foreign shipowners\r\n\r\nby  Italian  Income Tax law was  limited  to  such\r\n\r\nshipowners as did not possess an establishment  in\r\n\r\nItaly, whereas the Singapore Ordinance contained\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno such limitation, the proviso to section\r\n\r\n13  (1) (p) was not fulfilled, and therefore  that\r\n\r\nsection should not properly be construed so as  to\r\n\r\nexempt  non-resident Italian shipowners. Since  it\r\n\r\nwas  considered  anomalous that  British  shipping\r\n\r\nbenefitted from the exemption under Italian Income\r\n\r\nTax  law, while Italian shipowners were not exempt\r\n\r\nfrom  income tax in the then Colony of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  then Legislative Council was asked to approve\r\n\r\na resolution that any person resident in Italy and\r\n\r\ncarrying  on  the  business  of  a  shipowner   or\r\n\r\ncharterer  otherwise than through an establishment\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  shall  be  exempt  from  all   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the income Tax Ordinance,  1947,  in\r\n\r\nregard  to the gains or profits from his business.\r\n\r\nThe   Income  Tax  Ordinance,  as  amended  during\r\n\r\nMalaysia, now provides relief from tax on shipping\r\n\r\nonly  where  such  relief has been  secured  by  a\r\n\r\ndouble   taxation  agreement.  As   the   previous\r\n\r\nresolution   was   passed  primarily   to   accord\r\n\r\nreciprocal  income tax exemption  between  British\r\n\r\nand  Italian  shipowners during the colonial  era,\r\n\r\nthe  resolution has become an anomaly when the law\r\n\r\nwas  changed during Malaysia, and therefore should\r\n\r\nbe  rescinded  and replaced by a  double  taxation\r\n\r\narrangement  between  the  Singapore  and  Italian\r\n\r\nGovernments,  it follows that Italian non-resident\r\n\r\nshipowners  are  placed in an  identical  position\r\n\r\nwith all other foreign countries which do not have\r\n\r\na double taxation agreement with Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the resolution,\r\n\r\npassed  on 20th November, 1951, by the Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  the  Colony of  Singapore  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Income  Tax  Ordinance,  1947\r\n\r\n(No.39  of 1947) to exempt any person resident  in\r\n\r\nItaly and carrying on the business of shipowner or\r\n\r\ncharterer otherwise than through and establishment\r\n\r\nin Singapore from all the provisions of the Income\r\n\r\nTax  Ordinance,  1947, which relate  to  gains  or\r\n\r\nprofits  from  such  business, be  rescinded  with\r\n\r\neffect from the 1st day of January, 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INCOME TAX ORDINANCE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Exemption)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the resolution,\r\n\r\npassed on 16th September, 1952, by the Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  the  Colony of  Singapore  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1947  (No.\r\n\r\n39  of  1947)  to  exempt any person  resident  in\r\n\r\nSweden  and carrying on the business of  shipowner\r\n\r\nor    charterer   otherwise   than   through    an\r\n\r\nestablishment in Singapore from all the provisions\r\n\r\nof the Income Tax Ordinance, 1947, which relate to\r\n\r\ngains  or profits from such business, he rescinded\r\n\r\nwith effect from the 1st day of January, 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a resolution similar to the one I have\r\n\r\nreferred  to  in the case of Italy  just  now  was\r\n\r\npassed  by  the  Legislative Council  in  1952  to\r\n\r\nexempt  residents  of Sweden from  income  tax  or\r\n\r\nshipping profits, and the remarks I have made with\r\n\r\nregard  to the Italian case apply equally  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  Sweden,  except that in  1954  a  double\r\n\r\ntaxation   arrangement   was   effected    between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Sweden by extending the then  United\r\n\r\nKingdom/Swedish  Double  Taxation  Convention   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.

The entrepot trade  on\r\n\r\nwhich we thrived and prospered in the past is  not\r\n\r\nexpanding fast enough to provide the jobs for  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  population,  nor  is  it  capable   of\r\n\r\ngenerating  sufficient  revenue  to  maintain  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of education, housing, medical and  welfare\r\n\r\nservices  that a modern civilised society expects.\r\n\r\nHence,  five years ago we charted the  course  for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation to complement entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Entrepot Trade and industrialisation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy will have to be the maintenance of our\r\n\r\ntraditional  position as a trading centre,  whilst\r\n\r\nadding  an  industrial  base  to  our  traditional\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation and entrepot trade are not\r\n\r\nincompatible  as has been shown in  Rotterdam  and\r\n\r\nHamburg.  The  needs  and  requirements   for   an\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade  within an industrialised  country\r\n\r\ncan  be met by the creation of a free trade  zone.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  the  Government's intention  to  levy\r\n\r\nduties on goods not produced and not likely to  be\r\n\r\nproduced  in Singapore. Thus, traditional  imports\r\n\r\nof  products such as rubber, copra, pepper and  so\r\n\r\non,  will not attract duty. Similarly, goods which\r\n\r\nfeature  in  the tourist trade like cameras,  tape\r\n\r\nrecorders,  fountain pens and watches will  remain\r\n\r\nduty  free. For those which are dutiable  we  have\r\n\r\nset  up  an  area to cater for the  needs  of  our\r\n\r\nentrepot trade. An expert from the United  Nations\r\n\r\nis  studying ways and means of improving our  free\r\n\r\nport   facilities   so   that   our   policy    of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation will not, in any way, hinder the\r\n\r\nefficient handling of our entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Neutral Stand</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy of being friendly to anyone who wants\r\n\r\nto  trade with us has begun to pay dividends.  The\r\n\r\ngoodwill  mission led by the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas  met  with  favourable response from  all  the\r\n\r\ncountries visited and has returned with reports of\r\n\r\nthe  desire of countries wanting to increase trade\r\n\r\nwith  us. Yugoslavia and the U.S.S.R. are  sending\r\n\r\ntrade missions and have invited us in return. This\r\n\r\npolicy of friendliness to all nations is beginning\r\n\r\nto  show  results,  for the People's  Republic  of\r\n\r\nChina has already purchased rubber from us after a\r\n\r\nlong lapse of time. Therefore, we can look forward\r\n\r\nto an increase in our trading activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Indonesian Trade</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, naturally, since Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence and the events in Indonesia following\r\n\r\n30th September, resumption of trade with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndonesia looms large in the minds of many.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat again that our position as\r\n\r\na  trading  centre in South-East Asia is  open  to\r\n\r\neveryone,  including Indonesia,  so  long  as  our\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  that  of  our immediate  neighbour,\r\n\r\nMalaysia, is not jeopardized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole machinery of Government is geared to\r\n\r\ngive  the maximum incentives to existing  and  new\r\n\r\nindustries but it now has to help find markets for\r\n\r\nthem  too.  We must make every effort to  increase\r\n\r\nthe   rate  of  expansion  to  provide  sufficient\r\n\r\nprimary  jobs  in industry to absorb  the  growing\r\n\r\narmy of unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Prospective Markets</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, Mr Speaker, to go into some\r\n\r\ndetail on the question of prospective markets  for\r\n\r\nour  manufactured goods. These fall  roughly  into\r\n\r\nfour categories:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Markets in the developed, highly\r\n\r\nindustrialised countries of the world;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) New markets in Africa and Eastern Europe;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Markets to be provided by those countries\r\n\r\nwhich have been consistently running favourable\r\n\r\nbalances of trade with us; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Markets in those countries which have a\r\n\r\nvested  interest  in  ensuring  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nremains  viable  and stable so that,  in  turn,\r\n\r\ntheir   own   security   interests   are    not\r\n\r\njeopardized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  recent  years  increasing attention  has  been\r\n\r\nfocussed  on  the  need for highly  industrialised\r\n\r\ncountries  to  provide  outlets  for  the  simpler\r\n\r\nmanufactures of developing countries,  if  for  no\r\n\r\nother   reason  than  to  assist  the  latter   in\r\n\r\nfinancing  imports of machines and  other  capital\r\n\r\nequipment   needed   for   development.    Various\r\n\r\ninternational conferences have been held and there\r\n\r\nappears   to   be   increasing  realisation   that\r\n\r\nenlightened   self-interest   among   the   highly\r\n\r\ndeveloped economies would lead to enhanced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket opportunities for the developing countries.\r\n\r\nBut this can only come about slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to developing new markets, this can\r\n\r\nand should be done. Our policy of neutrality, \r\n\r\nnon-alignment  between the big power  blocs,  together\r\n\r\nwith our active identification with the Afro-Asian\r\n\r\nworld  gives  us  a  good  start  with  a  growing\r\n\r\nconsumer  world in Afro-Asia. Trade missions  will\r\n\r\nsoon  be  sent to these countries to  explore  and\r\n\r\ndevelop these markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, a cursory look at our trade\r\n\r\nstatistics  will  reveal that  there  are  several\r\n\r\ncountries  which  enjoy a favourable  position  in\r\n\r\ntheir  trade with us. We propose to persuade  them\r\n\r\nto  buy  more  of  our  products,  especially  our\r\n\r\nmanufactured  goods,  and  thereby   redress   the\r\n\r\nimbalance. We will shortly take the initiative  to\r\n\r\nenter into trade agreements with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be observed, Mr Speaker, in the three\r\n\r\ncategories  of  prospective markets  that  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned, even with the necessary effort, results\r\n\r\nwill  be  slow in coming, nor are they  likely  to\r\n\r\nhave   an   immediate  impact   on   our   growing\r\n\r\nunemployment problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the fourth category of markets -\r\n\r\nmarkets in those countries which have more than  a\r\n\r\npassing  interest in our survival. My  predecessor\r\n\r\nand   colleague,  the  Minister  of  Defence,  has\r\n\r\nalready referred in passing to this subject a  few\r\n\r\nweeks  ago. Our asset in this respect is  that  we\r\n\r\noccupy  a  position  of  some  importance  in  the\r\n\r\nstrategic   defence  chain  of  South-East   Asia.\r\n\r\nCountries  such  as the United Kingdom,  Australia\r\n\r\nand New Zealand, amongst others, are therefore not\r\n\r\nuninterested  that  the  link  through   Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  remain  intact. These  countries  have  an\r\n\r\ninterest that we survive and to this end  to  give\r\n\r\nus  export  opportunities. It would be unrealistic\r\n\r\nand  futile  to demand unlimited and  unrestricted\r\n\r\naccess  to  these  markets,  for  no  nation   can\r\n\r\ncountenance  imports  of such  volume  that  would\r\n\r\nimperil   their  domestic  industries.   We   have\r\n\r\nestimated that it will be necessary to find  about\r\n\r\n8,000 to 10,000 new jobs in industries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neach  year  for the next five to seven  years.  In\r\n\r\nvalue  terms this only means an additional  export\r\n\r\nof  M$120 million each year on a cumulative basis.\r\n\r\nThis  is  well within the capacity of  the  highly\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries to share and absorb. Care  and\r\n\r\nrestraint will be exercised in selecting  products\r\n\r\nwhich  will not disrupt their domestic industries.\r\n\r\nThey range from cutlery and ceramics to electrical\r\n\r\nand  automobile component parts, optical equipment\r\n\r\nand  so on. In all, Mr Speaker, about 200 to  300\r\n\r\nproducts. Essentially, emphasis will be  on  those\r\n\r\nproducts   which  we  can  make  efficiently   and\r\n\r\ncompetitively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gradually, over a period of time, Singapore\r\n\r\nshould be able to acquire the necessary efficiency\r\n\r\nto  compete in world markets on her own  strength.\r\n\r\nWhen  we have reached that stage, we in turn  will\r\n\r\nbe  prepared  to  extend to  others  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nassistance which we are now seeking. Our proposals\r\n\r\nare,  therefore,  a logical step  in  the  overall\r\n\r\nindustrial  development pattern of the undeveloped\r\n\r\nsectors of Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be making formal approaches to these\r\n\r\ncountries.  In  the  event  that  no  satisfactory\r\n\r\nsolutions  are  reached, then our whole  political\r\n\r\nfuture  will  have  to be re-assessed  and  a  \r\n\r\nre-alignment is inescapable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, to attain our objective in\r\n\r\ntransforming  Singapore into a  modern  industrial\r\n\r\nnation, Government action alone is not sufficient.\r\n\r\nThere  must  be a concerted effort by  Government,\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs and workers alike - the whole nation\r\n\r\nmust work as one. We have laid the infrastructure,\r\n\r\nwe  have provided the incentives and we have shown\r\n\r\nthe way ahead to more rapid industrialisation.  It\r\n\r\nis now up to the people of Singapore to respond to\r\n\r\nthe  call.  The  entrepreneurs must  ensure  by  a\r\n\r\nproper   choice   of  industries  and   industrial\r\n\r\nassociates that the products manufactured are of a\r\n\r\nquality   and   price  competitive  with   foreign\r\n\r\nproducts.  Our workers must also be  prepared  for\r\n\r\nfactory  discipline and hard work  to  make  costs\r\n\r\ncompetitive  in  the international  market.  There\r\n\r\nmust   be   restraint  and  discipline   on   both\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs and workers if we are to emulate the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nefforts  which  brought about the  great  economic\r\n\r\nrecoveries  after  the world war  in  Germany  and\r\n\r\nJapan.  Let  our industrialisation be  established\r\n\r\nfirst  on a firm basis before we think of  sharing\r\n\r\nthe  gains. Anti-nationalist elements even now are\r\n\r\ntrying  their best to foil us in our  attempts  to\r\n\r\nbring  about a more just and stable society.  They\r\n\r\nwill  try to dupe the rank and file of our workers\r\n\r\ninto  prematurely  demanding immediate  short-term\r\n\r\nbenefits which will kill the goose even before the\r\n\r\ngolden  eggs  are laid. This is where  progressive\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs and responsible trade unionists need\r\n\r\nto  exercise  restraint, patience  and  above  all\r\n\r\ndiscipline and judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some of our entrepreneurs who are\r\n\r\npursuing labour policies more suited for a  bygone\r\n\r\nage.  They  simply  do  not recognise  that  trade\r\n\r\nunions  exist, even responsible ones. Unless  they\r\n\r\nsit  up  and take notice that we are living  in  a\r\n\r\nmodern world where responsible unions have come to\r\n\r\nstay, they will be letting themselves in for a lot\r\n\r\nof  inconvenience and trouble. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders must dissuade their  members\r\n\r\nfrom   following  the  suicidal  lines  of  action\r\n\r\nadvocated by the anti-nationalists. It pays  these\r\n\r\nanti-nationalists  to create  unemployment,  chaos\r\n\r\nand  disorder, for these are the conditions  under\r\n\r\nwhich they thrive. It is the duty of every one  of\r\n\r\nus  to see that they do not succeed in their  evil\r\n\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t<br><br><i>Relationship with Malaysia</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it will be fitting, at\r\n\r\nthis  stage,  for  me  to  dwell  briefly  on  our\r\n\r\neconomic  relations with Malaysia since  Singapore\r\n\r\nDay.  The immediate effect of separation  was  the\r\n\r\nloss of the expectation of a Common Market and the\r\n\r\nretention  by  Singapore of all its revenues.  The\r\n\r\nquota  restrictions which were  in  force  on  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the  Tariff  Advisory  Board,\r\n\r\nprior  to Singapore Day, were also made applicable\r\n\r\nto  goods from Malaysia after that day. Honourable\r\n\r\nMembers  will  be  aware  of  the  arguments   and\r\n\r\ncounterarguments that were put forth on both sides\r\n\r\nof  the  Causeway for removal of restrictions  and\r\n\r\nfreeing of the trade. On\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  part, we suggested that there should be broad\r\n\r\nagreement   on  principles  relating   to   closer\r\n\r\neconomic  co-operation  and  that  following  this\r\n\r\ntrade  restrictions must be simultaneously lifted.\r\n\r\nThey  maintained that restrictions should be first\r\n\r\nremoved  before  talks  on  economic  co-operation\r\n\r\ncould begin. Finally, we agreed on 9th October  to\r\n\r\nmutual removal of restrictions. Events since  then\r\n\r\nhave  shown that negotiations will take some time\r\n\r\nin producing any result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturers entering Malaysia are treated\r\n\r\nas  those of a third country, as indeed they  have\r\n\r\nbeen all these years. There has been no change. On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  our manufacturers  now  have  a\r\n\r\nprotected  Singapore market where there  was  none\r\n\r\nbefore.  But Singapore's separation and  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  there is no common market with Malaysia does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that all economic, cultural  and  other\r\n\r\nties  between  the two countries  should  also  be\r\n\r\nsevered. One-third of their trade is with  us  and\r\n\r\nabout  a quarter of our trade is with them.  These\r\n\r\nties  have been built up over the last 140  years.\r\n\r\nNo  one can deny that continuation of these  links\r\n\r\nis  of mutual advantage. Furthermore, in terms  of\r\n\r\nhistory,   the   two   territories   are    really\r\n\r\ninseparable. And it must not be forgotten that the\r\n\r\ndestruction of one means destruction of the other.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we will never initiate any policy\r\n\r\nwhich will have the effect of further severing the\r\n\r\ntwo  countries.  We have made many proposals,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  without  receiving  any  positive\r\n\r\nrejoinder.  Perhaps we may be going too  fast  for\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur in putting up these proposals so soon\r\n\r\nafter separation. But we are always ready to adapt\r\n\r\nourselves to their tempo of working, provided they\r\n\r\nare  willing  to  meet us half-way.  If  they  are\r\n\r\nsincere  in  working towards closer  economic \r\n\r\nco-operation,  let  us in turn hear  from  them  what\r\n\r\ntheir  proposals are. Let us start  the  New  Year\r\n\r\nright.  Let us sit round the table, Ministers  and\r\n\r\nofficials, instead of each country being forced to\r\n\r\nwork  out how each can do without the other. I  am\r\n\r\nwilling, Mr Speaker, Sir, to meet the Malaysian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinisters and their officials at any time  and  at\r\n\r\nany place of their own choice early in January  to\r\n\r\nwork out measures for co-operation in the field of\r\n\r\ntrade and industry. We will continue to reason, to\r\n\r\ndiscuss and argue that economic co-operation holds\r\n\r\nno  dangers  to  either. But in the meanwhile,  we\r\n\r\nwill  launch  forth into new markets and  redouble\r\n\r\nour   efforts  to  increase  our  trade  with  all\r\n\r\ncountries of the West and of the East and of \r\n\r\nAfro-Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t\t<br><br><i>Currency</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on relations with Malaysia, Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nshould  like  to  refer to the traditional  common\r\n\r\ncurrency  which  we  have  had  all  these  years.\r\n\r\nHonourable  Members may recall that the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment  in December 1964, while Singapore  was\r\n\r\nstill  a  State  of Malaysia, gave notice  of  its\r\n\r\nintention to Brunei to wind up the Currency Board.\r\n\r\nUnder  this system our currency is backed  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  of 110 per cent or more by external assets\r\n\r\nand  is one of the main pillars on which financial\r\n\r\nstability has rested in the past. We have now been\r\n\r\ninformed that the notice referred to earlier still\r\n\r\nstands  and  discussions are now in progress  with\r\n\r\nthe   Malaysian  Government  as  to  the  currency\r\n\r\narrangements  which  should  be  entered  into  on\r\n\r\nexpiry  of the notice in June next year. I am  not\r\n\r\nin   a   position  to  divulge  details   of   the\r\n\r\ndiscussions.   The  Government   recognises   that\r\n\r\nsoundness  of  the currency is a prerequisite  for\r\n\r\nfinancial  stability  and public  confidence.  For\r\n\r\nthis reason, so far as Singapore is concerned,  we\r\n\r\nwill  ensure that whatever the arrangements  which\r\n\r\nmay  be arrived at, our currency will continue  to\r\n\r\nbe  backed  by  100 per cent or more  in  external\r\n\r\nassets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>External Resources</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of a period of momentous change in\r\n\r\nour  history, it will be well to take stock of our\r\n\r\npresent financial position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to prudent budgetting and careful\r\n\r\nallocation  of resources by the Government  during\r\n\r\nthe  past  six years, our external debt stands  at\r\n\r\nonly M$59\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion, whereas our official foreign reserves  by\r\n\r\nSeptember  this  year, stands at M$914.7  million,\r\n\r\nmade up as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                          Million\r\n\r\nSingapore's share of\r\n\r\n Currency Board Reserves\r\n\r\n (estimated)            ...

Our aim, Sir,  is\r\n\r\nfor  more  trade, not more aid,  for  by  this  we\r\n\r\nretain our freedom of action and self-respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Review of Economy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the economy continues to be\r\n\r\nrobust.  There was steady growth during  the  last\r\n\r\nfew      years,      Indonesian      confrontation\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding.  The economic  performance  of  a\r\n\r\ncountry  from year to year is best judged  by  the\r\n\r\nrate  of growth of its national income. The  House\r\n\r\nwill  recall  that  when  assessing  the  economic\r\n\r\neffects of confrontation, it was estimated that if\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian  embargo  on  trade  with  us  was\r\n\r\ncompletely successful, it would lead to  a  direct\r\n\r\ndecline  of  about 8.7 per cent  in  our  national\r\n\r\nincome. It gives me great pleasure to report  that\r\n\r\nin  1964,  Singapore's national  income  stood  at\r\n\r\nM$2,811 million, which reflected a rate of  growth\r\n\r\nof  some  two per cent over 1963. This meant  that\r\n\r\nthe   growth  in  the  other  sectors   not   only\r\n\r\ncompletely offset the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloss  in national income as a result of Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation but, indeed, went on  to  achieve  a\r\n\r\nnet increase. This clearly shows the resilience of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  absorb  and  overcome  sudden   and\r\n\r\ndrastic declines in earnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's capacity to overcome such national\r\n\r\noccupational hazards is rein forced by our\r\n\r\nperformance in external trade in the current year.\r\n\r\nThe value of external trade during the first nine\r\n\r\nmonths of the year totalled M$5,041.0 million,\r\n\r\nshowing a 8.6 per cent increase over the\r\n\r\ncorresponding period of the previous year. This is\r\n\r\na creditable performance considering the fact that\r\n\r\ntrade in 1964 declined by about 19 per cent\r\n\r\ncompared with 1963, as a result of Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation. Exports for the year were also up\r\n\r\nby 7.9 per cent while imports rose by 9.3 per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, a third good economic indicator is\r\n\r\nthe  volume  of business transacted by banks.  For\r\n\r\nthe first nine months of 1965 deposits as well  as\r\n\r\nloans  and advances of banks have shown increases.\r\n\r\nCommercial  bank deposits at the end of  September\r\n\r\n1965  stood  at  M$1,164.3 million  compared  with\r\n\r\nM$1,137.2  million  at the end  of  December  last\r\n\r\nyear. This is an increase of 2.4 per cent in  nine\r\n\r\nmonths. The most significant increase occurred  in\r\n\r\nfixed  deposits which showed a rise  of  12.4  per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average monthly level of loans and advances\r\n\r\nto  customers  in  1965 stands at M$937.4  million\r\n\r\nwhich  is  an increase of 11.2 per cent  over  the\r\n\r\naverage  monthly  level in  1964  which  stood  at\r\n\r\n$842.9  million. Despite Indonesian  confrontation\r\n\r\nand  the  sudden shock of separation,  banks  have\r\n\r\nmaintained  confidence in Singapore's  economy  by\r\n\r\nincreasing credit necessary for the transaction of\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, we have seen that Singapore's\r\n\r\nnational income in 1964 showed a net increase of 2\r\n\r\nper cent. One of the underlying factors which kept\r\n\r\neconomic  activity at this level in 1964  was  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial  growth  of  gross  capital  formation\r\n\r\nwhich  rose  from  $323 million in  1963  to  $415\r\n\r\nmillion in 1964, an increase of $92 million or  28\r\n\r\nper  cent compared with an average rate of 22  per\r\n\r\ncent during the years 1959 to 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increased rate of investment was undertaken by\r\n\r\nboth  the  public and the private  sector.  Public\r\n\r\nsector capital formation consists of public  works\r\n\r\nsuch  as  construction of new ring roads, low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing, expansion of utility services, e.g. power\r\n\r\nand    water,    and   industrial   infrastructure\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  e.g. the Jurong Industrial  Estate.\r\n\r\nDetails  on the rate of development will be  given\r\n\r\nlater  on  in my address when I review development\r\n\r\nexpenditure in the past year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private sector capital formation consists mainly\r\n\r\nof  two  components, namely, building construction\r\n\r\nand investment in new manufacturing industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly average area of building commenced in\r\n\r\nthe first eight months of 1965 is 1,564,000 square\r\n\r\nfeet,  which is an increase of 28.9 per cent  over\r\n\r\nthe  average monthly building activities commenced\r\n\r\nin   1964.   In  value  terms,  the  corresponding\r\n\r\nincrease in building commenced is $1,482,000 or 17\r\n\r\nper  cent  above  the  average  monthly  level  of\r\n\r\n$1,265,000  in  1964.  Area  of  buildings   under\r\n\r\nconstruction  as at end of August 1965  stands  at\r\n\r\n29.2  million square feet or 34.4 per  cent  above\r\n\r\nthe  area under construction at the end of  August\r\n\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component of private sector capital\r\n\r\nformation   takes  the  form  of   fixed   capital\r\n\r\ninvestment   in   new  manufacturing   industries.\r\n\r\nCapital    investment   on   fixed    assets    by\r\n\r\nmanufacturing     companies    awarded     pioneer\r\n\r\ncertificates  at  the end of October  1965  totals\r\n\r\nM$223.5  million compared with $170.4  million  at\r\n\r\nthe end of the corresponding month last year. This\r\n\r\nis an increase of 31 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth of Singapore's economy in the past year\r\n\r\ncan  also  be  seen  in  increased  production  of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industries. In terms of  industrial\r\n\r\noutput,  provisional data derived  from  the  1964\r\n\r\nCensus of Industrial Production indicate that even\r\n\r\nwith the fall in rubber processing activity, there\r\n\r\nwas  an  estimated growth of 16 per cent  in  1964\r\n\r\nover 1963. Industrial output in 1964 was estimated\r\n\r\nat  $1,052  million compared with $909 million  in\r\n\r\n1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1965, 35 new pioneer manufacturing companies\r\n\r\ncommenced production, bringing the total number of\r\n\r\npioneer firms in production up to 82. In addition,\r\n\r\nanother    63   pioneer   factories   are    under\r\n\r\nconstruction or being established. The 82  pioneer\r\n\r\nfirms  already in production are presently  giving\r\n\r\nemployment  to 9,000 workers compared  with  4,200\r\n\r\nworkers  employed in 1964. The level of employment\r\n\r\nwill  rise  to  14,300 workers  when  these  firms\r\n\r\nachieve full production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's gratifying rate of economic\r\n\r\nperformance  in the year under review has  enabled\r\n\r\nour people to buy more of the good things of life.\r\n\r\nThe number of new motor-cars registered during the\r\n\r\nfirst  ten months of 1965 showed an in, crease  of\r\n\r\n7,528 or 7.6 per cent over December 1964.

By the end  of  the\r\n\r\nyear  the overall rate of increase in new vehicles\r\n\r\nregistered  may  well be 10 per  cent  over  1964.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  television sets  imported  during  the\r\n\r\nfirst nine months of the year were valued at  $7.6\r\n\r\nmillion compared with imports of $5.9 million  for\r\n\r\nthe  corresponding period of 1964, an increase  of\r\n\r\n28 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>General Review of Revenue and Expenditure in 1965</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now come to the general\r\n\r\nreview  of revenue and expenditure for this  year.\r\n\r\nIn   the   original  Estimates  of   Revenue   and\r\n\r\nExpenditure for 1965, when Singapore was still  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  revenue  accruing  to  the  State   was\r\n\r\nestimated  at $339.6 million and State expenditure\r\n\r\n(including  a  transfer  of  $20  million  to  the Development   Fund)   at  $359.8   million.   With\r\n\r\nseparation  both revenue and expenditure  in  1965\r\n\r\nwill he substantially increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of additional revenue reverting wholly to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government are shown  in  a  paper\r\n\r\nbeing  presented  as  Supplementary  Estimates  of\r\n\r\nRevenue, 1965. The increase in revenue amounts  to\r\n\r\n$43.2 million, representing the 40 per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncent  that would have been payable to the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  under  Malaysia.  Total  estimates  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  for the year will therefore be  increased\r\n\r\nto $382.8 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October $310.3 million of the total estimated\r\n\r\nrevenue was collected. Another $72 million  should\r\n\r\nbe  collected in the last two months of this year,\r\n\r\nbringing total revenue to $382.3 million, or  $0.5\r\n\r\nmillion short of the estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expenditure side Singapore will now have\r\n\r\nto  bear  the expenditure of those departments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore which were formerly Federal departments,\r\n\r\ne.g.  Police,  Posts and Telecoms, Civil  Aviation\r\n\r\nand  so  on,  as  well as two new  Ministries  -\r\n\r\nDefence  and  Foreign Affairs.  For  this  purpose\r\n\r\nprovision  of  $39.3 million is  being  sought  as\r\n\r\nSupplementary Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Supplementary Estimates a sum of $6.7\r\n\r\nmillion  is  also being sought for five  heads  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  whose 1965 provision is insufficient.\r\n\r\nThe  total of $46 million being sought will  bring\r\n\r\ntotal  estimates of expenditure for  the  year  to\r\n\r\n$405.8 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual outlay up to 31st October, 1965, amounted\r\n\r\nto  $286.4 million. Expenditure for the  last  two\r\n\r\nmonths  of  the  year,  including  a  $20  million\r\n\r\ntransfer to the Development Fund, is estimated  to\r\n\r\nbe approximately $103.4 million. Total expenditure\r\n\r\nfor  the  year  will, therefore, be around  $389.8\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With total expenditure for the year amounting to\r\n\r\n$389.8  million  arid  total  receipts  of  $382.3\r\n\r\nmillion  only,  a  deficit  of  $7.5  million   is\r\n\r\nexpected.  Since the expenditure figure of  $389.8\r\n\r\nmillion includes a capital transfer of $20 million\r\n\r\nthere is, in fact, a surplus of $12.5 million from\r\n\r\nour  current account. The surplus in 1964 was only\r\n\r\n$3.1  million. Considering the problems we had  to\r\n\r\nface  on  account of confrontation and  the  large\r\n\r\nsums  that  we had to contribute to the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment towards defence and internal  security,\r\n\r\nthings  have  turned out far better  than  we  had\r\n\r\ndared to hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue, 1965</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of tobacco duty and stamp\r\n\r\nduty, revenue from the other taxes has come up  to\r\n\r\nexpectations.  Income  Tax is  expected  to  yield\r\n\r\n$99.3  million -- which is nearly $5 million  more\r\n\r\nthan  the  sum  collected in  1964.  Although  the\r\n\r\nincrease could be attributed partly to the changes\r\n\r\nin the rates and basis of assessment introduced by\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  Government, whereby tax-payers  at\r\n\r\nthe base had to pay more and the withdrawal of the\r\n\r\nconcession to working wives of separate assessment\r\n\r\nfor  earned  income,  the yield  from  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nclearly indicates that the effect of confrontation\r\n\r\non    taxable   earnings   in   1964   has    been\r\n\r\ninsignificant, if at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indications are that duty from petroleum will\r\n\r\nreach  $51.8  million this year. This exceeds  the\r\n\r\nsum estimated for the year by $7.8 million and  is\r\n\r\n$11.3  million more than the amount  collected  in\r\n\r\n1964. Registration fees for vehicles are likely to\r\n\r\nshow  an  increase from $5.9 million  in  1964  to\r\n\r\napproximately $6.4 million this year - a  rise  of\r\n\r\nslightly more than half a million dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs duty and excise duty on liquor are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  amount to $19.5  million  and  $14.8\r\n\r\nmillion  respectively. The sum  of  $19.5  million\r\n\r\nfrom  Customs duty is about the same as for  1964.\r\n\r\nExcise  duty has, however, risen by about  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion   dollars.  Entertainment   duty,   though\r\n\r\nexpected  to  be  about  $0.2  million  below  the\r\n\r\nestimate of $7.5 million, is in fact $1.4  million\r\n\r\nmore  than in 1964. These increases, though small,\r\n\r\nare all significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receipts from stamp duty are anticipated to yield\r\n\r\nonly  $5.7  million this year -  a  drop  of  $1.3\r\n\r\nmillion  below  the  amount  collected  in   1964.\r\n\r\nProperty  tax,  however, is not affected  and  the\r\n\r\nestimated sum of $58.1 million is expected  to  be\r\n\r\nrealised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobacco duty is likely to suffer a fall from\r\n\r\n$43.6  million  in 1964 to about  $42  million  in\r\n\r\n1965.  The  fall  is  due to  a  decrease  in  the\r\n\r\nconsumption of imported cigarettes and  the  trend\r\n\r\nto  switch  from  the use of leaf-tobacco  bearing\r\n\r\nfull  rates  of  duty  to leaf-tobacco  attracting\r\n\r\npreferential rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Expenditure, 1965</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main increases in expenditure are as usual in\r\n\r\nrespect   of   expenditure  on  social   services;\r\n\r\nespecially  expenditure on Education and  Hospital\r\n\r\nservices.  The Ministry of Education is seeking  a\r\n\r\nsupplementary provision of $5.4 million. This will\r\n\r\nraise  expenditure on Education to $113.3 million.\r\n\r\nThis  is about $10 million above that of 1964;  an\r\n\r\nincrease   of  approximately  10  per  cent.   The\r\n\r\nHospitals Division requires an additional  sum  of\r\n\r\n$780,000 making a total of $38.7 million  for  the\r\n\r\nyear; which is also about 10 per cent higher  than\r\n\r\nthe  previous year.

A sum of $300,000 is being sought\r\n\r\nby   the   Public  Works  Department  for   street\r\n\r\nlighting.

Revenue\r\n\r\nhas also correspondingly increased, mainly because\r\n\r\nSingapore  no longer has to share the proceeds  of\r\n\r\nits taxes with any other Government. Total revenue\r\n\r\nfor  the  year  is estimated at $537 million.  The\r\n\r\nestimated   surplus,  before   transfer   to   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund, is thus $30.44 million.  It  is\r\n\r\nproposed  to transfer $30 million next year.  This\r\n\r\nwill leave a small balance of approximately half a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the   most\r\n\r\ngratifying feature of the Budget for next year  is\r\n\r\nthat  it is being balanced without having  to  run\r\n\r\ndown our reserves and on top of it we hope to show\r\n\r\na small surplus as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Expenditure 1966</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure of the Ministry of Education for next\r\n\r\nyear remains the highest. The estimate for 1966 is\r\n\r\n$129.2  million,  which is  nearly  $16.3  million\r\n\r\nabove the sum expected to be spent this year.  The\r\n\r\nincrease is on account of the increasing number of\r\n\r\nchildren  moving  up  from  Primary  to  Secondary\r\n\r\nSchools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the expansion in hospital services, a\r\n\r\nsum  of  $43.6 million is estimated to be required\r\n\r\nfor  the  Hospitals Division of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth,  a  rise of $4.9 million over  expenditure\r\n\r\nthis year. The rate of increase is thus almost  as\r\n\r\nhigh as that of expenditure on Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A substantial increase of about $5 million,\r\n\r\nbringing  the  provision up to  $28.8  million  is\r\n\r\nbeing provided for the Public Health Division, The\r\n\r\nmajor  part of the increase is for the acquisition\r\n\r\nof   more  staff  and  equipment  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nstandard of cleanliness of the growing city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new major burdens which Singapore now has to\r\n\r\nbear are in respect of internal security defence.\r\n\r\nExpenditure for the Police is estimated at $40.3\r\n\r\nmillion. Details of expenditure for defence have\r\n\r\nyet to be finalised. Very roughly, a sum of\r\n\r\napproximately $30 million will be required, and a\r\n\r\nblock vote of this sum has  been entered under the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Interior and Defence head of\r\n\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $4.2 million has been provided for the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs. The main cost of this\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  in the expenditure of  our  missions\r\n\r\nabroad.  The  amount required will depend  on  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  missions we are able to  set  up  next\r\n\r\nyear. It is, therefore, difficult to estimate with\r\n\r\nany  precision  at  this stage, and  supplementary\r\n\r\nprovision  may  he required in the course  of  the\r\n\r\nyear if more missions are established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue, 1966</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the major taxes are expected to show\r\n\r\nincreases next year. Customs and Excise duties  on\r\n\r\npetroleum   products,  together   with   the   new\r\n\r\nprotective  tariffs  introduced  in  October  this\r\n\r\nyear,  are  estimated to yield $47.8  million,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of $3.8 million over 1965 Estimates.  The\r\n\r\nestimated  revenue of $20.1 million  from  Customs\r\n\r\nduties  on liquor is $1.6 million higher than  the\r\n\r\nestimate  for this year. Property Tax is estimated\r\n\r\nto  increase from $58.1 million estimated for 1965\r\n\r\nto $65 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a steady decline in the revenue\r\n\r\nfrom  tobacco  tax.  Based on present  trend,  the\r\n\r\nrevenue  for  1966 is estimated at  $42.5  million\r\n\r\nagainst  the  1965  estimate of $48  million.  The\r\n\r\nreasons have been dealt with in the review of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent year's revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposition of a tax on fuel oil by the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Government created considerable problems\r\n\r\nin certain manufacturing industries as the cost of\r\n\r\nproduction was increased. Within powers  available\r\n\r\nunder   the  Customs  Ordinance,  all  bona   fide\r\n\r\nmanufacturers   utilising  fuel  oil   have   been\r\n\r\nexempted  from  the  fuel oil  tax  as  from  19th\r\n\r\nNovember  this  year. The Public Utilities  Board,\r\n\r\nalso  a  major consumer of fuel oil, has not  been\r\n\r\nexempted  from the fuel oil tax as such.  Measures\r\n\r\nare  examined to ascertain whether it is  possible\r\n\r\nfor  the Public Utilities Board not to pass on  to\r\n\r\nmanufacturers the tax element on fuel oil used  in\r\n\r\ngenerating electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protective duties introduced on 11th October\r\n\r\nthis  year  in  the  wake  of  duties  imposed  by\r\n\r\nMalaysia also have a revenue effect. Revenue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  these new 154 protective duties are expected\r\n\r\nto yield $14.6 million next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No new Customs duties are expected to he\r\n\r\nintroduced  for revenue purposes next  year.  Such\r\n\r\nCustoms duties as will he introduced will  be  for\r\n\r\nprotective reasons and are not expected  to  yield\r\n\r\nany significant revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review must now be made of other taxes. On the\r\n\r\nday  of Singapore's separation from Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nrepeal of the Turnover Tax was announced. Nineteen\r\n\r\ndays  later, the Capital Gains Tax was  rescinded.\r\n\r\nNo revenue was derived from these taxes. As\r\n\r\nthree-quarters  of  the  fiscal  year  had  expired   by\r\n\r\nSingapore  Day, it was not possible to  change  or\r\n\r\nrescind  all  the  unsatisfactory fiscal  measures\r\n\r\nintroduced  by the Central Government during  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Income Tax Bill has been introduced at this\r\n\r\nmeeting  of Parliament to make such amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe income Tax law as are necessary to accord with\r\n\r\nthe sovereign and independent status of Singapore.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I will now point out  the  main\r\n\r\nfeatures of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) With effect from 1st January, 1966,\r\n\r\nexemptions  from tax in respect  of \r\n\r\nowner-occupied  houses  will  he  limited  to   a\r\n\r\nmaximum  net  annual value  of  $3,000  and\r\n\r\nrestricted to a single property as  it  was\r\n\r\nin    Singapore   before   Malaysia,   thus\r\n\r\nrescinding    the   Central    Government's\r\n\r\nunrestricted  exemption  of  owner-occupied\r\n\r\nhouses  without limit as to value or number\r\n\r\nsince  1st  January,  1965.  Indiscriminate\r\n\r\nexemption  wil1  favour  wealthy   property\r\n\r\nowners unduly, and such a policy is not  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the objective  of  a  more\r\n\r\njust and equal society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) For the year of assessment 1966, working\r\n\r\nwives in Singapore will again be allowed to\r\n\r\nchoose to be assessed separately from their\r\n\r\nhusbands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  respect of their earned income.  During\r\n\r\nMalaysia  the combined incomes  of  working\r\n\r\nhusbands and wives were aggregated for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  income tax, and only  a  small\r\n\r\nrelief was allowed for the wives' earnings.\r\n\r\nTo  encourage half our population to engage\r\n\r\nin   productive  work  and   increase   the\r\n\r\nnational  income,  wives will  be  assessed\r\n\r\nseparately next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The opportunity will also be taken to restore\r\n\r\nthe   rates  of  certain  personal  reliefs   for\r\n\r\nindividual taxpayers and bodies of persons to the\r\n\r\npre-Malaysian  levels, with  the  exception  that\r\n\r\nchild allowances will apply to a maximum of  five\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The rates of tax on the higher income\r\n\r\ngroup  will  be  restored to  pre-Malaysian\r\n\r\nlevels as the rates imposed during Malaysia\r\n\r\nare   considered  incompatible   with   the\r\n\r\nprinciple of imposing the heavier burden of\r\n\r\ntaxation on those best able to bear it. For\r\n\r\nexample, the Singapore upper rate of tax of\r\n\r\n55 per cent on personal incomes of $100,000\r\n\r\nor more per year was reduced by the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  to 50 per cent during  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwith  effect from 1st January, 1965.  There\r\n\r\nwill  be provision in the Bill to re-impose\r\n\r\nupper  tax of 55 per cent with effect  from 1st January, 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already announced on\r\n\r\nI9th  November proposals to give added  incentives\r\n\r\nto industry. Double deduction for tax purposes for\r\n\r\nmarket  development  overseas  and  for  increased\r\n\r\nlocal    advertisement   expenditure    for    our\r\n\r\nmanufacturers will be provided in the Bill.  There\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  flexible  powers  to  accord   key\r\n\r\nindustry, particularly expert-orientated industry,\r\n\r\nincreased rates of depreciation so that plant  and\r\n\r\nequipment could be written\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noff  for  tax  purposes  within  three  years,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these remedial measures, income\r\n\r\ntax  collections in 1966 are expected to fall  as\r\n\r\ncompared with this year. A sum of $95.5 million is\r\n\r\nestimated  for  1966, or a fall  of  $3.8  million\r\n\r\nbelow  the estimated collections this year.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  rate  to be reintroduced, separate assessment\r\n\r\nfor earned income of working wives, which is to be\r\n\r\nrestored,  will  also reduce the  tax  payable  on\r\n\r\ntheir incomes. We are also reverting, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  the pre-Malaysian rates with  regard  to\r\n\r\nestate duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention here the intentions of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  regard  to  the  tax  position  of\r\n\r\npersons  who  are resident either in Singapore  or\r\n\r\nMalaysia  but derive income from both territories.\r\n\r\nIt  is  quite  clear that in view  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependent status the existing \"combined  income\"\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  both  the  Singapore  and  Malayan\r\n\r\nIncome   Tax  Laws  will  have  to  be   reviewed.\r\n\r\nDiscussions with the Malaysian Government are  now\r\n\r\nin train with the objective of concluding a double\r\n\r\ntaxation  agreement at an early date so  that  the\r\n\r\nposition of taxpayers in both territories  can  be\r\n\r\nput on a proper basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the subject, Mr Speaker, Sir, I may\r\n\r\nalso  mention that the Government desires to enter\r\n\r\ninto   double   taxation  agreement   with   other\r\n\r\ncountries, especially those whose residents are or\r\n\r\nwill  be  investing in Singapore. These agreements\r\n\r\nwill  remove the inhibition to investment inherent\r\n\r\nin double taxation of profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t<br><br><i>Second Five-Year Development Plan</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, 1966 marks the first year of - the\r\n\r\nSecond  Development  Plan  of  Singapore.  It   is\r\n\r\nopportune  for  us  to assess  what  was  achieved\r\n\r\nduring the past five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In formulating the First Development Plan, major\r\n\r\nemphasis  was  laid  on  economic  development  to\r\n\r\ncreate conditions favourable for industrial growth\r\n\r\nthrough construction of infrastructure facilities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  as  power, water, port, industrial  estates,\r\n\r\narterial   roads   and  other   ancillaries.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment also provides more direct assistance to\r\n\r\nindustries    by   establishing    the    Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board. The Board provides loan as well\r\n\r\nas   equity  capital  for  the  establishment   or\r\n\r\nexpansion of industries. In the social sector, the\r\n\r\naim  was limited to providing a satisfactory level\r\n\r\nof    social   services,   particularly   housing,\r\n\r\neducation and health amenities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Plan drawn up for the period 1961-64\r\n\r\nenvisaged a total development expenditure of  $871\r\n\r\nmillion.  However,  at the  end  of  1964  it  was\r\n\r\ndecided to extend the First Plan for another  year\r\n\r\nso  that  Singapore, as a State of Malaysia  then,\r\n\r\ncould  follow the development planning  period  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  as a whole. Hence, final expenditure  of\r\n\r\nthe  extended First Plan for 1961-65,  instead  of\r\n\r\nfrom  196l-64, is estimated to total $944 million.\r\n\r\nPlan  allocation and final expenditure are  likely\r\n\r\nto be as follows:-\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \t\tPlan Provision\r\n\r\n                       \t\t   1961-64\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \tM$ \t \t %\r\n\r\n Economic Development      \t507.95  \t58.32\r\n\r\n Social Development             349.88  \t40.17\r\n\r\n Public Administration      \t13.19  \t\t 1.51\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t------\t\t-----\r\n\r\n                      \t\t871.02\t\t 100\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t------\t\t-----\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n             \t\t\tFinal Expenditure\r\n\r\n             \t\t\t    1961-65\r\n\r\n             \t\t\t\r\n\r\n                        \t M$ \t\t  %\r\n\r\n Economic Development      \t587.98\t\t 62.3\r\n\r\n Social Development        \t342.82\t\t 36.3\r\n\r\n Public Administration      \t13.26 \t\t 1.4\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t------\t\t-----\r\n\r\n                     \t\t944.06 \t\t100\r\n\r\n                     \t\t------\t\t-----\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of expenditure on development in the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  under  the  First  Plan  showed  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  increase over the  five-year  period.\r\n\r\nExpenditure rose from $132.11 million in the first\r\n\r\nyear  of the Plan to around $242 million in  1965.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an indication of increasing capacity  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  Sector  during  the  Plan  period  to\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  mobilise  resources  and   undertake\r\n\r\ndevelopmental work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing the results of the First Plan, it\r\n\r\nwill  be useful to assess the performance  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy  as a whole during this period,  including\r\n\r\nprivate sector investment as well. National income\r\n\r\nhas  gone up from $2,030 million in 1960 to $2,811\r\n\r\nmillion in 1964, showing an annual growth of 7 per\r\n\r\ncent.  As population increase averaged only 3  per\r\n\r\ncent per annum, there has been an increase in  the\r\n\r\nper  capita  income of the country. Gross  capital\r\n\r\nformation  has  increased even more substantially.\r\n\r\nIt  has  increased from $137.3 million in 1960  to\r\n\r\nover  $414.7  million in 1964. This  reflects  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of  increase in investment in  the  country\r\n\r\nduring this period and also clearly indicates that\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  investment  has  expanded  up  to\r\n\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the performance of the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector has been  most  encouraging.\r\n\r\nTotal  output  of firms employing  more  than  ten\r\n\r\nworkers  excluding  rubber  processing,  increased\r\n\r\nfrom  $465.6 million in 1960 to $843.7 million  in\r\n\r\n1963,  while value added had increased from $142.1\r\n\r\nmillion   to   $252.6  million.  These  aggregates\r\n\r\nfurnish  a measure of the substantial achievements\r\n\r\nof the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is now independent, the formulation\r\n\r\nand  implementation  of the Second  Plan  must  be\r\n\r\nwithin   the  new  political  framework.  A   more\r\n\r\nrealistic approach is needed in planning  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  The Second Plan fully reflects  this  new\r\n\r\noutlook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the First Plan has also helped to\r\n\r\nchange  the  strategy of planning for the  future.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the problems, especially in  the  social\r\n\r\nsector,  relating  to primary  education,  general\r\n\r\nhealth services and housing, are now less pressing\r\n\r\nthan  they were in 1959. The birth rate has fallen\r\n\r\nfrom about 4.3 per cent to about 3.2 per cent  and\r\n\r\nthe  rate of natural increase is now only 2.5  per\r\n\r\ncent  as against 3.3 per cent in 1959. Though this\r\n\r\nis not likely to have any immediate effects in the\r\n\r\nSecond  Plan period, it does provide for a  change\r\n\r\nin  emphasis  in the long run. The development  of\r\n\r\npower\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  port  facilities  has  also  been  more  than\r\n\r\nadequate  and  has  been  significantly  ahead  of\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, the provision of employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  has become even  more  urgent.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  persons  likely to  enter  the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket  during  the  Second Plan  period  is  much\r\n\r\ngreater  than  in  the  previous  period.  It   is\r\n\r\nestimated  that  about  95,000  persons  will   be\r\n\r\nentering  the  labour market in  this  period.  In\r\n\r\naddition, the backlog of unemployed as at the  end\r\n\r\nof 1965, is estimated to be around 55,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now a need for even more stringent\r\n\r\nevaluation  of  development  projects.  Basically,\r\n\r\nindustries must become more competitive  in  world\r\n\r\nmarkets sooner than was necessary in the past. The\r\n\r\nemphasis in the Second Plan period will be on  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  of the industrial base largely  with\r\n\r\nexport markets in view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total Second Plan size is about $1,520\r\n\r\nmillion.  Economic development  will  account  for\r\n\r\nabout 64 per cent of the total Plan outlay. Social\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects will take up 32 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  outlay and the balance of 4 per cent will  be\r\n\r\nPublic Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allocation of the Second Plan by type of\r\n\r\nexpenditure is broadly as follows :-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                         Million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic development     $975.9    64.2% of Total Plan Outlay\r\n\r\nSocial development       $484.1    31.8% of Total Plan Outlay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Administration    $ 61.1    4.0% of Total Plan Outlay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, due to Singapore's new political status\r\n\r\nand  the need to secure alternative export markets\r\n\r\nfor our industries, the Economic Planning Unit has\r\n\r\nbeen directed to re-evaluate development proposals\r\n\r\nand  basis  of allocation of expenditure  to  take\r\n\r\ninto account the changed circumstances. Subject to\r\n\r\nchanges which may be necessary as a result of this\r\n\r\nre-evaluation, sectoral allocation is  broadly  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                 \t\t  Million\r\n\r\nRural and Land Development        $130.1\r\n\r\nPublic Utilities                  $316.1\r\n\r\nIndustry and Trade                $342.8\r\n\r\nTransport and Communications      $186.7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll  these  will  give the money to  be  spent  on\r\n\r\neconomic  development 64.2 per cent share  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal outlay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Development will account for $484 million\r\n\r\nor 31.8 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Administration $61.4 million or 4 per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not the time for me to\r\n\r\ngo  into  further detail on the Second  Plan.  The\r\n\r\nSecond  Plan, which will be given a more  thorough\r\n\r\nre-evaluation   in   the   light    of    changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances, will be tabled in the new year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t<br><br><i>1966 Development Estimates</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn our attention to the 1966\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Estimates   which   call   for    an\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of $275 million. Total public  sector\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  1966,  including  development   by\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies financed from  their  own  funds\r\n\r\nwill,  however,  be around $314 million.  Allowing\r\n\r\nfor  a  ten  per  cent shortfall  in  performance,\r\n\r\nactual  Government development funds required  may\r\n\r\ntotal only $250 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions in the 1966 Development Estimates will\r\n\r\nbe   spent  on  projects  to  be  undertaken   by\r\n\r\nGovernment  Departments, tentatively approved  for\r\n\r\ninclusion  in  the  Second Plan.  There  are  also\r\n\r\nprovisions  for  loans  and  grants  to  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies  to  assist  them  in  carrying  out  their\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes as envisaged in  the  Plan.\r\n\r\nAs 1966 is the first year of the new Plan, most of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  are for new schemes  whose  total\r\n\r\ncost  adds up to $242.4 million, or 88.9 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the  total provision for the 1966  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates.  The balance of the Development  Budget\r\n\r\nis  made  up by revotes for spillover schemes.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  these are schemes  started  in  the\r\n\r\nFirst  Plan  but will be completed  in  1966.  The\r\n\r\nrevotes amount to $33.2 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be noted that many projects, with\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the Estimates, will be  subject  to\r\n\r\nthe  sanction of the Economic Planning Unit.

The funds will be  used\r\n\r\nto construct and complete four primary schools and\r\n\r\n19 secondary schools. In the programme of bringing\r\n\r\nexisting schools up to standard size requirements,\r\n\r\nprovisions are made for major extensions  to  five\r\n\r\nexisting  schools and the reconstruction  of  four\r\n\r\nrural  primary  and island schools  into  standard\r\n\r\nsize schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t<br><br><i>Ministry of Health</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministry of Health, a scheme worth\r\n\r\nmentioning  is  the development of a  Radioisotope\r\n\r\nTherapy  Centre  within the Institute  of  Medical\r\n\r\nSpecialities  which the Government is  setting  up\r\n\r\njointly  with  the University of Singapore.

A careful study of the problem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nled to the conclusion that Singapore should resort\r\n\r\nto  mechanical  techniques  of  disposing  garbage\r\n\r\nwaste by using a Garbage Disposal Plant as adopted\r\n\r\nby  modern cities of other countries. In 1966  the\r\n\r\nfirst Plant of 100-ton capacity will be erected at\r\n\r\nRedhill Industrial Estate at an estimated cost  of\r\n\r\n$2.5 million. It will take oven a year to complete\r\n\r\nthe  scheme for which $1.68 million will be  spent\r\n\r\nin  1966.  Two  more such Garbage Disposal  Plants\r\n\r\nwill  he  built during the next five years.  Other\r\n\r\nschemes  under Health will improve and extend  the\r\n\r\nhealth services which have already achieved a high\r\n\r\nstandard    comparable   with   other   developing\r\n\r\ncountries in the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Ministry of Finance</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed expenditure for the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance  is $82.93 million. The main provision  is\r\n\r\nfor   the  Jurong  Industrial  Estate  which   the\r\n\r\nEconomic   Development  Board  will  continue   to\r\n\r\ndevelop. Phase I of the scheme is almost completed\r\n\r\nand  the provision of $36.0 million for 1966 would\r\n\r\nsubstantially he for the development of the Second\r\n\r\nPhase of the scheme. Another 55.0 million has been\r\n\r\nprovided  for the development of light  industrial\r\n\r\nestates at Kallang Park and Kallang Basin, as well\r\n\r\nas  the  construction of a seven-storeyed  flatted\r\n\r\nfactory at Redhill Industrial Site.

More than $130 million or some  50  per\r\n\r\ncent   of  the  total  capital  Budget  has   been\r\n\r\nallocated  to  this  Ministry. The  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nalone will spend $45 million to build about 12,000\r\n\r\nunits  of low-cost housing in 1966 as part of  its\r\n\r\nSecond Five-Year Housing programme. The Urban  \r\n\r\nRe-development Scheme will continue next year. So far\r\n\r\n$8.14  million has been spent and $15 million  has\r\n\r\nbeen  provided for 1966. Singapore  is  the  first\r\n\r\ndeveloping  country to undertake an Urban  Renewal\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  such size. The programme  can  only\r\n\r\nsucceed  with  the  support and  participation  by\r\n\r\nprivate enterprise. As an incentive the Government\r\n\r\nhas  decided  to give a substantial  reduction  in\r\n\r\nproperty  tax on new buildings completed with  the\r\n\r\napproval  of  the  Urban Renewal  authorities.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, Mr Speaker, Sir, private developers\r\n\r\nparticipating  in  Urban Renewal  would  obtain  a\r\n\r\nquicker and higher return from their investments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East Coast Reclamation and Kallang\r\n\r\nReclamation  Schemes will also he carried  out  by\r\n\r\nthe Housing and Development Board on behalf of the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The two schemes will reclaim  300  and\r\n\r\n100  acres  of land respectively next  year.  When\r\n\r\ncompleted  in two years' time 2,000 acres  of  new\r\n\r\nund  would  be  added  to Singapore's  territorial\r\n\r\ndomain.   A  total  of  $20.4  million  has   been\r\n\r\nallocated for land reclamation work in 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multi-storey car park at Market Street has\r\n\r\nproved  successful.

In\r\n\r\nview  of  this,  a second multi-storey  car  park,\r\n\r\nalthough  on  a  smaller scale compared  with  the\r\n\r\nexisting  one,  will be built at  Phillip  Street.\r\n\r\nThis  project  will  cost $1.5  million  of  which\r\n\r\n$300,000 will be provided in 1966 for piling  work\r\n\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Law and National Development in a\r\n\r\njoint  venture  with the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  will build a 22-storey building at  Erskine\r\n\r\nHill  to house all the departments of the Ministry\r\n\r\nand  the  Board. The cost of the scheme  is  $14.0\r\n\r\nmillion  and  Government's  share  will  be   $7.0\r\n\r\nmillion. In 1966 $1.0 million has been entered  in\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates for this scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main project of the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  the Ministry of Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment is the Central Abattoir and Quarantine\r\n\r\nStation  which is being built in Jurong.  Such  an\r\n\r\nabattoir   is   necessary  to   provide   adequate\r\n\r\nslaughtering     facilities     to      recognised\r\n\r\ninternational   standards   in   order   to   gain\r\n\r\nacceptance  of Singapore's canned meat exports  in\r\n\r\nworld  markets. The scheme will cost $5.4  million\r\n\r\nof  which  $4.5 million has been voted  for  1966.\r\n\r\nOther   projects   of   the   Department   include\r\n\r\nconstruction   of  more  extension  centres,   the\r\n\r\nexpansion   of   the  farm  school  at   Sembawang\r\n\r\nAgricultural Station and the provision of improved\r\n\r\nfacilities  for extension services to farmers  and\r\n\r\nthe rural population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.W.D. has a development expenditure Budget\r\n\r\nof $28.31 million for 1966 as compared with $23.40\r\n\r\nmillion last year. For roads and bridges a sum  of\r\n\r\n$12.38  million  will be spent; for  drainage  and\r\n\r\nflood  alleviation,  $2.52 million,  and  sewerage\r\n\r\nworks,  $11.65 million. Construction of new  roads\r\n\r\nand   bridges,   extensions  and  improvement   of\r\n\r\nexisting  bridges have become a  matter  of  great\r\n\r\nurgency  because  of  the rapid  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of motor vehicles. Amongst the interesting\r\n\r\nprojects authorised for next year are the widening\r\n\r\nof  Merdeka  Bridge and an elevated  highway  over\r\n\r\nMountbatten Road beginning from Guillemard  Circus\r\n\r\nto Fort\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad.  In regard to drainage and flood alleviation\r\n\r\nschemes,  1966  will  see the  completion  of  the\r\n\r\nGeylang River Scheme. The First Phase of the flood\r\n\r\nalleviation for Bukit Timah would begin next year.\r\n\r\nThis scheme has become urgent because of the rapid\r\n\r\nhousing  and other developments along Bukit  Timah\r\n\r\nRoad   and  these  rapidly  built-up  areas   have\r\n\r\naggravated the flooding there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the development programme of the State,\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not intend to lag behind  in  the\r\n\r\nfield  of  modern sanitation which is an essential\r\n\r\nrequisite  of  a clean and healthy city.  Sewerage\r\n\r\nschemes  will be developed to keep pace  with  the\r\n\r\nprogress  in  the  development of  industrial  and\r\n\r\nresidential  estates  and  in  the  Urban  Renewal\r\n\r\nprogramme.

What  is\r\n\r\nnow needed is a return to the pioneering spirit of\r\n\r\nour  forefathers who by their dynamism, hard work,\r\n\r\nand self-sacrifice turned what was an inhospitable\r\n\r\nswamp  into  the largest port in South-East  Asia.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has never before failed  to  seize  any\r\n\r\nopportunity  for its advancement and  I  am  sure,\r\n\r\ngiven the right direction, they will not let  slip\r\n\r\nthis golden opportunity to build themselves into a\r\n\r\ngreat  and  prosperous nation, a  spur  for  \r\n\r\nlike-minded neighbours to achieve for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

I can therefore safely assume  that\r\n\r\nMembers of this Parliament are conversant with the\r\n\r\nwrongs  alleged  and this makes my  task  so  much\r\n\r\neasier in taking up the cudgels for the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal issue involved is the question of\r\n\r\nback-dating of wage revisions provided in  clauses\r\n\r\n5  and 9 of the Agreement signed in November  1961\r\n\r\nafter the strike by these workers was called  off.\r\n\r\nThe strike was called off because the workers were\r\n\r\nconfident  that  the pro-labour  Government  would\r\n\r\nabide  by the promises solemnly given and  written\r\n\r\ninto the Agreement. Clause 5 runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The wages, working conditions and all other\r\n\r\nterms and conditions of service of the daily-rated\r\n\r\nemployees of the Government shall he revised to be\r\n\r\nthe  same  as  those of similarly employed  \r\n\r\ndaily-rated  employees  of  the  City  Council  who  are\r\n\r\nemployed   in  Government  Ministries.

A\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  Representatives of the  Government,\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council,  the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard and the Federation shall undertake the  said\r\n\r\nrevisions and shall attempt to conclude it  within\r\n\r\ntwo  months from the making of this Agreement. Mr\r\n\r\nC.  V.  Devan  Nair  may be present  at  Committee\r\n\r\nmeetings at the request of the Federation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several counts on which the Government\r\n\r\nis   to   be   blamed  for  the   delay   in   the\r\n\r\nimplementation   of   these  clauses.   The   most\r\n\r\nimportant  we could consider is that the  proposed\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  Representatives  to  undertake  the\r\n\r\nformulation  of  a  new  wage  structure  was  not\r\n\r\nformed. Instead one year after the Agreement,  the\r\n\r\nTreasury   put   to  the  Union   a   unilaterally\r\n\r\nformulated scheme, in direct contravention of  the\r\n\r\nclause which provided for a Committee to set about\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of a new wage  structure.  This\r\n\r\nwas  signally  wrong and in our opinion  generated\r\n\r\nmost  heat.  It must be apparent to all  and  even\r\n\r\nmore to the Treasury officials that the unilateral\r\n\r\napproach  is the quickest route to a deadlock.  It\r\n\r\nis  therefore  difficult  to  understand  why  the\r\n\r\nTreasury    officials   ignored   the    Agreement\r\n\r\nstipulated   procedure  of   revising   the   wage\r\n\r\nstructure.  Joint  consultation, joint  discussion\r\n\r\nand  joint formulation has become part and  parcel\r\n\r\nof  healthy  industrial relations. And  those  who\r\n\r\nsigned  the Agreement in 1961 knew perfectly  well\r\n\r\nthat  a joint approach would be the only means  of\r\n\r\nproducing  quick  results. The only  thing  to  be\r\n\r\ndeduced  from  the  manner in which  the  Treasury\r\n\r\nofficials  have  gone  about  in  this  matter  is\r\n\r\nperhaps bureaucracy has not altogether disappeared\r\n\r\nand  the proper orientation is yet to take  place.\r\n\r\nHow else can one explain this glaring disregard of\r\n\r\na  provision in a collective agreement between the\r\n\r\nGovernment and its workers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the nearest the Commission of Inquiry came to\r\n\r\ncastigating  the  Treasury  officials  for   their\r\n\r\nfailure  here  was  in  these  words:  \"that   the\r\n\r\nprocedure stipulated in clause 9 be implemented as\r\n\r\nsoon  as  possible\", when on this score there  was\r\n\r\nample  justification for lambasting  the  Treasury\r\n\r\nofficials for their contempt of the Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission of Inquiry which looked into the\r\n\r\ngrievances of the workers seems to have taken  the\r\n\r\nview that a revision of the wage structure was  an\r\n\r\nextraordinarily  complex  task.  This  is   hardly\r\n\r\ncredible  in  Singapore  when  we  have  shown  an\r\n\r\nextraordinary  ingenuity  in  solving  even   more\r\n\r\ndifficult problems. What is extraordinary is  that\r\n\r\nfour  years have gone by and that we are no nearer\r\n\r\na  solution. The whole issue reeks of the lethargy\r\n\r\nof  the  Treasury  officials and probably  on  the\r\n\r\nmistaken  belief  that here is  a  sector  of  the\r\n\r\npublic   service   whose  just  demands   can   be\r\n\r\ncomfortably ignored by the higher echelons in  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service.  I hope it is a belief  they  will\r\n\r\nhasten to correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all this, I would now like to come to\r\n\r\nthe central argument of the N.T.U.C. in this case.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister invited the N.T.U.C. to discuss\r\n\r\nthis issue in the Parliament, where he assured us,\r\n\r\nMembers would be free to speak their minds on this\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister's grounds for Parliamentary discussion of this dispute were that certain fundamental principles are involved when questions of back pay are raised. The Prime Minister has not said something new. Public funds are perennially involved in the payment of public workers, and\r\n\r\nback-pay is no exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal arena for a resolution of this dispute\r\n\r\nbetween both parties when collective bargaining is\r\n\r\nexhausted is in the Industrial Arbitration  Court.\r\n\r\nThe   suggestion   by   the  Prime   Minister   is\r\n\r\nunprecedented.  Nevertheless, we have  no  quarrel\r\n\r\nwith  the  suggestion because we believe  in  this\r\n\r\nParliament,  rational argument will be  given  its\r\n\r\nproper weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary stake to us in the dispute is the\r\n\r\nsanctity of the collective agreement. In  fact  in\r\n\r\nSingapore today, the collective agreement  is  the\r\n\r\ntouchstone  of  industrial stability.  Both  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and  employers have adopted a  responsible\r\n\r\nattitude  towards  collective  agreement  that   a\r\n\r\nmeasure  of the Queensbury rules has been possible\r\n\r\nfor  some  time  now between both  management  and\r\n\r\nlabour, where fury and scorn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  the  order  before. Dr Goh Keng  Swee,  our\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Defence,  in  his  address  in   the\r\n\r\nInternational Labour Seminar gave pre-eminence  to\r\n\r\nsocial  values  in the development  of  a  country\r\n\r\nwhich  to our minds must include moral obligations\r\n\r\nand  in  this dispute the moral obligation of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is to respect the undertaking given  to\r\n\r\nthe  workers in the Agreement that the back-dating\r\n\r\nof  wage  claims  has  to be  effective  from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1961. In short, we expect the Government\r\n\r\nto  honour  the undertaking it has  given  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this Parliament will realise that\r\n\r\nsince  the  democratic trade  union  movement  has\r\n\r\nassumed  command  of  the labour  situation  after\r\n\r\ndefeating  the  anti-national forces,  strikes  by\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  have been few and far between,  not\r\n\r\nfor  pure love of virtue, but because we  want  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a  climate  for  economic  growth   and\r\n\r\nadvancement and we are proud to say that  we  have\r\n\r\nmade a direct contribution in this regard. We have\r\n\r\ngone  out  of  our way to emphasise the  need  for\r\n\r\norderly industrial relations, not only in our  own\r\n\r\ninterests simply because we want to stay alive  as\r\n\r\na  movement but for our collective interests. This\r\n\r\nmay  not be palatable, but the settlement of  this\r\n\r\ndispute  on  the terms of the 1961 Agreement  will\r\n\r\nprove  to be the acid test of principled response.\r\n\r\nThe Government's integrity in industrial relations\r\n\r\nhas   to  he  immaculate.  So  we  would  say  the\r\n\r\nfulfilment of governmental moral obligations is of\r\n\r\nsupreme  importance because it goes  to  the  very\r\n\r\nroots  of the political philosophy and the  ideals\r\n\r\nof high civilisation we are striving to evolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No less than the Prime Minister himself was an\r\n\r\neloquent spokesman on moral obligations.  In  more\r\n\r\nor  less these words he said: \"Workers should  not\r\n\r\nbe  made to suffer for delays in negotiations  for\r\n\r\nwhich  they are not responsible\" - referring to  the\r\n\r\ninterim bonuses paid to the Harbour Board workers.\r\n\r\nbecause of prolongation of negotiations for  which\r\n\r\nthe  Harbour workers were not to blame. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister when he said this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas   in   the   distinguished  company   of   the\r\n\r\nArbitration   Courts  of  Australia,   India   and\r\n\r\nelsewhere  who have upheld that the  principle  of\r\n\r\nretrospective  payments  is  justified  in   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances in which the satisfaction  of  union\r\n\r\nclaims  has been delayed through no fault  of  the\r\n\r\nUnion.  Such delay, the Courts have declared,  may\r\n\r\noccur  because of administrative reasons,  or  the\r\n\r\nunwillingness   of  employers  to   take   matters\r\n\r\nseriously at the negotiating table or even because\r\n\r\nof  delays  in  the hearing of trade  disputes  by\r\n\r\nArbitration    Courts.   In   all   such    cases,\r\n\r\nretrospective payments have been justified in  the\r\n\r\npast and will continue to be so justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of retrospective payments must be\r\n\r\nregarded  as a penalty provision on employers  who\r\n\r\nare inclined towards procrastination and delays in\r\n\r\nthe  face of legitimate union claims. Such penalty\r\n\r\nclauses  are  obviously  necessary  if  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations in a civilised community are to  proceed\r\n\r\non  an  even  keel. Employers are  no  more  above\r\n\r\npenalty provisions than trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having established the validity of the Public\r\n\r\nDaily-Rated Workers' claims for back-pay,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave no doubt that an Industrial Arbitration Court\r\n\r\nhas  incorporated this principle in  its  body  of\r\n\r\nlaw,  we would like to say that it has taken us  a\r\n\r\nlong  time and effort to formulate rules  for  the\r\n\r\npreservation of industrial peace with justice  and\r\n\r\nthe  N.T.U.C. views  this  principle  as  a \r\n\r\npre-eminently  major contributing factor  to  securing\r\n\r\nindustrial peace not only in the public sector hut\r\n\r\nin   the  private  sector  as  well,  because   in\r\n\r\nparticular,  employers in the private sector  tend\r\n\r\nto  watch  which way the cat jumps in  the  public\r\n\r\nsector and when it jumps in the direction to their\r\n\r\nadvantage,  they  would  have  no  hesitation   in\r\n\r\nadopting  that course. We would also like  to  say\r\n\r\nthis,  that  the  N.T.U.C. has  no  intention  of\r\n\r\ndegenerating  into an effete movement.  That  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  in the interests of Singapore as a whole,\r\n\r\nnor  do  we believe that the Government is anxious\r\n\r\nthat  we should deteriorate to that level, as only\r\n\r\nquite  recently the Minister for Labour,  when  he\r\n\r\nopened  the  Second Convention  of  the  N.T.U.C.,\r\n\r\nstated that a docile\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade   union   movement  is  not  a  constructive\r\n\r\nalternative to a pro-Communist movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the situation in the Public Daily-Rated\r\n\r\nServices is one of open frustration, aggravated by\r\n\r\nstern  warnings  on behaviour and  discipline  and\r\n\r\nshould  the  continued delay engender a  trial  of\r\n\r\nstrength, we must make it clear that our  sympathy\r\n\r\nwill be thrown effectively on the workers' side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not relish the idea of challenges or\r\n\r\nshowdowns. We would much rather put them behind us\r\n\r\nand  regard  ourselves as part of the constructive\r\n\r\ncomposite which Singapore has become but we can do\r\n\r\nso  only on the confidence and the respect of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  of Singapore which we have so far earned.\r\n\r\nWe  shall not put this in jeopardy because  it  is\r\n\r\nnot good for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentlemen, I have elaborated the case of the\r\n\r\nPublic Daily-Rated Employees sufficiently and have\r\n\r\nthree things for you to consider:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The claims of the workers are just - they\r\n\r\nhave been deprived by the tardy conduct  of\r\n\r\nthe  Treasury officials of a wage  increase\r\n\r\nfor the past four years;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The back-pay demand is not something extra\r\n\r\nbeing  demanded but the accumulation of  an\r\n\r\nincrease in wages that is due to them,  and\r\n\r\nfinally    that    once   principles    are\r\n\r\nestablished we cannot afford to  shift  our\r\n\r\nground.

I do not propose  to\r\n\r\nmake  a similar lengthy statement, but if I might,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to summarise what the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok Blangah has said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it can be put down under three headings,\r\n\r\nthat is -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Government acted unilaterally in\r\n\r\nformulating a scheme to implement the  wage claims  \r\n\r\nin the Collective Agreement,  1961, entered into \r\n\r\nbetween the Government and the Public Daily Rated \r\n\r\nEmployees Unions Federation;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Due to its procrastination, Government\r\n\r\ndeprived the workers of their just awards;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The demand for back-pay is nothing unusual\r\n\r\nin matters of wage increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the first two points together, as\r\n\r\nthey   seem  to  me  curiously  linked.  My  first\r\n\r\nreaction   is   that   these   two   points    are\r\n\r\ncontradictory.  How can you accuse the  Government\r\n\r\nof  having taken unilateral action and in the same\r\n\r\nbreath  also allege that it procrastinated?  True,\r\n\r\non   the  point  of  the  unilaterally  formulated\r\n\r\nscheme, the facts of the matter are that after the\r\n\r\nagreement  was  signed between the Union  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, instructions were given to  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  to implement forthwith those  clauses\r\n\r\nwhich  were clear-cut and straightforward. On  the\r\n\r\nclauses relating to wages, it was not at all  that\r\n\r\nstraightforward, and a number of discussions  took\r\n\r\nplace   between  the  Union  representatives   and\r\n\r\nTreasury   officials.   Arising   out   of   these\r\n\r\ndiscussions, the Treasury presented to the Union a\r\n\r\ndraft  scheme  setting out full  details  for  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the wage clauses as a basis  for\r\n\r\nfurther discussion. This action is nothing new and\r\n\r\nin  fact is common practice in all meetings. It is\r\n\r\nuseful  and  it  is  an occasion  on  which  draft\r\n\r\nproposals  are put forward as a basis for  further\r\n\r\ndeliberation.  This  was exactly  what  the  draft\r\n\r\nscheme  sought  to  achieve.  After  a  number  of\r\n\r\nmeetings, agreement was reached between the  Union\r\n\r\nand  Treasury  representatives.  Indeed  a  signed\r\n\r\nstatement   is  on  record  in  a  Treasury   file\r\n\r\nsignifying the consent of the Union\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  issue  of  that scheme. It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nhighly misleading for the Union, four years  after\r\n\r\nthe  event  has  taken place, to  make  a  general\r\n\r\nallegation of unilateral action on the part of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of procrastination or delay,\r\n\r\nthereby depriving the workers of just increases in\r\n\r\ntheir  wages, this is unfair. The scheme  referred\r\n\r\nto   earlier  provides  for  implementation   with\r\n\r\nretrospective  effect from the 1st January,  1961.\r\n\r\nEvery employee received some increase in wages. In\r\n\r\nthe vast majority of cases, each employee received\r\n\r\nan  increase of 40 cents per day and in some cases\r\n\r\nbenefited up to a dollar and fifty cents per  day.\r\n\r\nThe  annual cost of this wage revision was in  the\r\n\r\nregion  of  $\ufffd million a year. Among  the  actions\r\n\r\ntaken   by   the   Government   to   hasten    the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of the collective agreement,  when\r\n\r\nthere  were  allegations by the  Union  that  some\r\n\r\nclauses of the Agreement had not been implemented,\r\n\r\nwas  the  establishment of a Commission of Inquiry\r\n\r\nunder  the  chairmanship of  the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nLabour  with  members nominated to  represent  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  Union. The  Commission  made  a\r\n\r\nthorough study of the matter and made a number  of\r\n\r\nspecific  recommendations and wage adjustments  in\r\n\r\nits  findings.  All these specific recommendations\r\n\r\nof   the   Commission   had  been   accepted   and\r\n\r\nimplemented  by the Government with  retrospective\r\n\r\neffect from the 1st of January, 1961. There are  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  disputed  grades  on  which  even  the\r\n\r\nCommission  was not in a position to  make  direct\r\n\r\nrecommendations. And as the Union is aware, on the\r\n\r\ninstructions of the Prime Minister with a view  to\r\n\r\neffecting  a  speedy  end to this  long  drawn-out\r\n\r\ndispute  and  concluding a complete settlement  of\r\n\r\nthe  1961  collective agreement, a Job  Evaluation\r\n\r\nTeam with Union participation has been working for\r\n\r\nsome time. The Job Evaluation Team is expected  to\r\n\r\nmake its recommendations soon. Everything possible\r\n\r\nhas  been  done  to conclude the  1961  collective\r\n\r\nagreement and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnion  is aware that the Government is as anxious,\r\n\r\nif not more so, to see an end to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point that the Member for Telok Blangah\r\n\r\nmade is of fundamental importance. The Member made\r\n\r\na  point  that backpay is not unusual. But  I  say\r\n\r\nthat   back-pay  must  be  discouraged,   if   not\r\n\r\naltogether  disallowed, because no Government  can\r\n\r\nplan  its  financial policies and administer  them\r\n\r\nwisely  if there is a sinister threat that out  of\r\n\r\nnowhere  someone is going to produce a  bill  that\r\n\r\nthe Government has to make arrears for back-pay. I\r\n\r\nam  of  course  aware that in certain  situations,\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Courts  as  well  as  managements  had\r\n\r\nagreed to some arrears in wage increase, but  this\r\n\r\nmust  be  the exception rather than the rule.  The\r\n\r\npolicy of Government on back-pay is well known  to\r\n\r\nall  the Staff Unions. As Minister for Finance,  I\r\n\r\nam  particularly anxious to see that  considerable\r\n\r\nfinancial  resources  are not  frittered  away  by\r\n\r\ndemands  on  back-pay  when  such  resources   are\r\n\r\ndesperately  needed for the financing of  economic\r\n\r\nprojects in the country for the general upliftment\r\n\r\nof  the  standard of living of the people  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   It   is   only  in   very   exceptional\r\n\r\ncircumstances that I would be prepared  to  see  a\r\n\r\ndeparture  in  this  ruling  provided   that   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  implications are not  considerable.  In\r\n\r\nthis  connection,  Sir, I am reminded  of  a  very\r\n\r\nvalid point made by the late Dr F.C. Benham  when\r\n\r\nhe  was  entrusted  to report  on  a  revision  of\r\n\r\nsalaries for Government officers in 1951. In  that\r\n\r\nReport,  the  author expressed the view  that  the\r\n\r\npractice  of backdating, that is giving  back-pay,\r\n\r\nis  erroneous in principle. He went on to say, \"If\r\n\r\nGovernment  were to follow the general  rule  that\r\n\r\nwhenever it revised any of its contracts it should\r\n\r\nbackdate  the  revision in order to  redress  past\r\n\r\ninjustices, it would be unable at any time to make\r\n\r\na  proper  estimate of its financial  position.  A\r\n\r\ngreat deal of unnecessary clerical and other  work\r\n\r\nwould  be  created  and  the  business  of  public\r\n\r\nadministration  would be hopelessly  complicated.\"\r\n\r\nThere is also the question of tactics,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker.  Back-pay  weakens  the  bargaining\r\n\r\nposition  in negotiation. If the Union is  assured\r\n\r\nof   backdating,  there  would  be  no  compelling\r\n\r\nincentive  for  the  Union  to  desire   a   quick\r\n\r\nconclusion  in negotiation as it would be  assured\r\n\r\nthat  whatever  form  of agreement  is  ultimately\r\n\r\nreached the benefits therefore would be backdated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to remind the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah, and all other Members who  harbour\r\n\r\nsimilar   sentiments,  that  this  Government   is\r\n\r\ncommitted to raising the standard of living of all\r\n\r\nits  people, most of all the working class people;\r\n\r\nbut in doing so,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  must  plan  its  limited  financial  resources\r\n\r\ncarefully  and wisely, and that the guiding  motto\r\n\r\nto  be followed should be one of looking ahead for\r\n\r\nfurther  achievements rather than looking backward\r\n\r\nand  long  drawn-out disagreements that do  nobody\r\n\r\nany good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this house do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Forty-four minutes past Four o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
