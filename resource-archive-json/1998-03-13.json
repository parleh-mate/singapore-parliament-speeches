Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b>\r\n\r\nSir,  may  I  continue with my response to  the  various  points\r\n\r\nraised yesterday.  When we adjourned, I was responding to Dr Ong\r\n\r\nChit  Chung's question on the United Nations.  The second  point\r\n\r\nhe  had raised on the UN was with regard to our candidature  for\r\n\r\nthe  United Nations Security Council for the non-permanent seat.\r\n\r\nHe asked me for a progress report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that Singapore presented its\r\n\r\ncandidature  for the non-permanent seat in the Security  Council\r\n\r\nfor  the period 2001 to 2002.  The elections for that particular\r\n\r\nvacancy  will  take place in the year 2000 and, if  elected,  we\r\n\r\nhope  that  we  can bring a constructive and useful perspective,\r\n\r\nshall  I  say,  a  small state perspective, to the  UN  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil.   It is an important perspective because a majority  of\r\n\r\nthe  United Nations members are small states.  Participating  in\r\n\r\nthe UN Security Council will also allow Singapore to learn first-hand  how  the UN Security Council operates, both in its  formal\r\n\r\nsession  as  well as in the consultations.  Since  we  became  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the United Nations in 1965, we have never served  in\r\n\r\nthe  UN Security Council which of course, in a sense, is at  the\r\n\r\nvery  heart  of the UN system.  So far, Singapore  is  the  only\r\n\r\ndeclared candidate for the Asian group seat for the year 2001 to\r\n\r\n2002.  Our candidature has been endorsed by ASEAN countries  and\r\n\r\nmany  other countries, both from within the Asian group as  well\r\n\r\nas outside the Asian group, have expressed their support for our\r\n\r\ncandidature in writing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that within our limited manpower and financial\r\n\r\nresources, Singapore can do only so much at the United  Nations.\r\n\r\nBut let me assure the House that we will continue to do our part\r\n\r\nas a responsible member of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUN  system and as a member of the international community.   And\r\n\r\nthat  is one of the reasons why we have sought the non-permanent\r\n\r\nseat in the Security Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may, Sir, proceed to the other points which were\r\n\r\nraised  yesterday  and not answered.  First,  I  will  take  the\r\n\r\nvarious comments which were made on Singapore-Malaysia relations\r\n\r\nby  Dr  Ong Chit Chung, Mr Chiam See Tong, Mr Hawazi and  a  few\r\n\r\nothers.  First, to recap the events since we last discussed  the\r\n\r\nsituation in this House.  When we recall our last discussion  in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  it  was  in the context of still  fairly  strained\r\n\r\nrelations  between our two countries.  But on that  occasion,  I\r\n\r\ndid  say  that  there  were  some  encouraging  developments  to\r\n\r\nindicate  that relations were slowly getting back to normal.   I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that since then there have been further  significant\r\n\r\ndevelopments in our bilateral relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in September last year, the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Customs commenced stringent checks on lorries ferrying\r\n\r\ngoods  from  Malaysia to Singapore and vice versa.   An  adverse\r\n\r\neffect of this move was the chronic vehicular congestion at  the\r\n\r\nCauseway  that  lasted up to one month or so.  Fortunately,  the\r\n\r\nsituation  eased soon after the two Prime Ministers met  at  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Edinburgh in October\r\n\r\n1997 and they agreed that both sides should see how this problem\r\n\r\nshould be resolved early.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the recent developments? Since the two Prime\r\n\r\nMinisters  met  in  October, they have  met  on  three  separate\r\n\r\noccasions,  once  in January and twice in February,  the  latest\r\n\r\nbeing 16th February when Prime Minister Goh visited Malaysia  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur.  Prime Minister Goh's visit to Kuala  Lumpur  was\r\n\r\nsignificant  in  that it took place against a  backdrop  of  the\r\n\r\nregional economic downturn which has been described as the worst\r\n\r\ncrisis faced by the region since the Second World War.  In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  our Prime Minister's visit was a useful opportunity  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  his  earlier  discussions  with  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nMahathir,  the earlier discussions being held a few weeks  prior\r\n\r\nto that in February\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  well as on 20th January.  These discussions were focused  on\r\n\r\nhow  Singapore  and  Malaysia could  cooperate  closely  in  all\r\n\r\npossible areas for mutual benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the interests of Singapore and Malaysia are closely\r\n\r\nintertwined,  particularly in the economic area.  The  contagion\r\n\r\neffect of the regional financial crisis has underscored this and\r\n\r\nemphasised  the  fundamental  interdependency  between  regional\r\n\r\ncountries  and  the  need to cooperate.   Our  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nvisit, I believe, reflected the readiness of both Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  to  work towards realising the full potential  in  our\r\n\r\nbilateral  relationship based on the principle  of  prosper-thy-neighbour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the discussions between Prime Minister Goh and Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir took place in a warm and friendly atmosphere.   And  on\r\n\r\nthe  whole, the visit was useful for both Singapore and Malaysia\r\n\r\nbecause  both  sides  can  now build on  this  for  even  closer\r\n\r\nrelations.   I believe, Sir, that this is a direction  in  which\r\n\r\nSingapore-Malaysia relations should continue to develop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcome of the discussions between the two Prime\r\n\r\nMinisters is reflected in a joint communique which was issued at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  our Prime Minister's visit.  That joint communique\r\n\r\nspells out several areas of proposed cooperation between the two\r\n\r\ncountries,  including  financial and economic  cooperation.   It\r\n\r\nserves  also  to  highlight  the commitment  by  both  sides  to\r\n\r\nredouble   efforts  to  resolve  several  outstanding  bilateral\r\n\r\nissues, such as the long-term supply of water to Singapore,  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Malayan Railway land in Singapore as well as  the\r\n\r\ndispute  over Pedra Branca.  As stated in the joint  communique,\r\n\r\nthe agreements reached between the two Prime Ministers have laid\r\n\r\na  firm  foundation for both Malaysia and Singapore to cooperate\r\n\r\nclosely in the future.  We hope that progress can be made on the\r\n\r\noutstanding issues.  This will help to maintain the momentum  in\r\n\r\nbilateral relations.  So in response to the questions  posed  by\r\n\r\nDr Ong Chit Chung and others on bilateral relations, I would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay  that  bilateral relations are back on track,  and  this  is\r\n\r\nevident from the joint communique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not wish to mislead Members into believing\r\n\r\nthat  we  have solved all the problems.  There are still  issues\r\n\r\nthat  remain  to  be  solved.  These  issues  cannot  be  solved\r\n\r\novernight.   However, I believe that our Prime Minister's  visit\r\n\r\nand  the discussions between the two leaders have indeed laid  a\r\n\r\ngood  foundation  for  further  progress  to  be  made  on   the\r\n\r\noutstanding bilateral issues.  And as Prime Minister Goh said to\r\n\r\nthe  press  after the visit,  it was a useful  visit.   In  this\r\n\r\nimproved  atmosphere  and common desire to enhance  cooperation,\r\n\r\nboth   sides,  I  believe,  can  now  better  manage   bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noted what Mr Chiam See Tong has said about the\r\n\r\npossibility of an economic union between Singapore and Malaysia,\r\n\r\na point which he had made previously when he spoke in the debate\r\n\r\non  the  President's Address last year.  I understand the  basic\r\n\r\nthrust  of  his  proposal, which is that  he  recommends  closer\r\n\r\neconomic  cooperation between Singapore and  Malaysia.   And  as\r\n\r\nMembers  are aware, the joint communique issued after the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  discussion has indeed mentioned that  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  will intensify efforts to cooperate in  the  areas  of\r\n\r\nbanking  and finance, and all possible areas.  Efforts are  also\r\n\r\nunder  way  to encourage mutual investments in the key  economic\r\n\r\nsectors  of  both  countries.   This  will  make  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  stakeholders in each other's prosperity, to  cite  the\r\n\r\nsentiments in the communique\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members in this House should also know that ASEAN\r\n\r\nis  now working towards establishing a free trade area (AFTA) by\r\n\r\nthe  year  2003.   At  the moment, this is a  current  priority.\r\n\r\nHowever, as for Mr Chiam's proposal of an economic union, and  I\r\n\r\nam  no expert on this matter, I have no doubt that my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Trade and Industry, would take note of this and\r\n\r\ngive it consideration within the broader context and desire of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncloser  economic cooperation with Malaysia.  But we must  remind\r\n\r\nourselves, as Prime Minister Goh said last year in his reply  to\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam,  that such cooperation, of course, takes two  willing\r\n\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the progress of various items in the communique, the\r\n\r\nofficials from both sides, I believe, will meet in the course of\r\n\r\nthe  next  few  weeks to follow up on the various items  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunique.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam made reference to the question of the water\r\n\r\nsupply.  This has also been dealt with by Minister Lee Yock Suan\r\n\r\nyesterday,  when  winding  up  on  the  Ministry  of  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry.   To that, let me just add that, as reflected  in  the\r\n\r\njoint  communique,  Dr Mahathir had agreed that  Malaysia  would\r\n\r\nundertake  to  continue the supply of water to Singapore  beyond\r\n\r\nthe expiry dates of the existing 1961 and 1962 water agreements.\r\n\r\nThis general undertaking will be confirmed in an agreement to be\r\n\r\nsigned  within  sixty  days  from  the  issuance  of  the  joint\r\n\r\ncommunique.   Officials from both countries, I understand,  will\r\n\r\nbe  meeting  in Kuala Lumpur on or around 9th April  to  discuss\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had originally sought a full water agreement with\r\n\r\nspecific   terms  and  conditions.   Achieving  a   full-fledged\r\n\r\nagreement   with  Malaysia  on  extending  the  existing   water\r\n\r\nagreements  beyond the present expiry dates  of  2011  and  2061\r\n\r\nwould  help  not  only  in dismantling a  psychological  barrier\r\n\r\nbetween  our two countries, but replace it with a new  framework\r\n\r\nof   cooperation  for  mutual  benefit.   However,  Dr  Mahathir\r\n\r\nindicated  that  he  was  unable  to  agree  to  a  full-fledged\r\n\r\nagreement  at  this point of time.  He said that he  would  also\r\n\r\nneed  time to get the backing of state governments, as water  is\r\n\r\nunder state control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lacking a firm agreement that sets out explicitly and\r\n\r\ncomprehensively the terms and conditions for the supply of water\r\n\r\nbeyond  the present terminal dates, we will have, of course,  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to intensify our efforts to find new sources of  water\r\n\r\nsupply.   This is something, as mentioned on other occasions  in\r\n\r\nthis House, we have been actively doing over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  years, even though water is not of immediate issue for  us.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  desalination, of course, remains one salient  option\r\n\r\namong several that are being explored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn, Sir, to the comments and questions raised\r\n\r\nby  colleagues on Singapore-Indonesia relations.  I would  first\r\n\r\nspeak  generally about bilateral relations since the House  last\r\n\r\nmet  in  the  Committee of Supply.  I would say  that  bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations generally are close and good.  Our ties with Indonesia\r\n\r\nhave  been built on a strong foundation based on common interest\r\n\r\nin   many  spheres.   Relations  in  the  past  year  have  been\r\n\r\nstrengthened by regular exchanges of visits.  Our Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  President  Suharto have kept up their regular  meetings  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss various issues.  In August 1997, some of our Members  of\r\n\r\nthis   House   visited  Indonesia  in  conjunction  with   their\r\n\r\nindependence day celebrations.  This is a good reflection of the\r\n\r\nbroad-based relationship between the two countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been concrete examples of close bilateral\r\n\r\ncooperation.  One clear example was the difficult joint  search-and-rescue-cum-recovery  operations  in  the  aftermath  of  the\r\n\r\nSilkAir  MI 185 tragedy at Palembang in December last year.   It\r\n\r\nwas heartening to see cooperation from the ministerial level  to\r\n\r\nthe  local authorities on the ground.  And the tragedy, while  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  we certainly would have wished it had not taken  place,\r\n\r\nhad brought our two countries and people closer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But taking the situation as at present, we must recognise\r\n\r\nthat  Indonesia  is going through a difficult patch.   They  are\r\n\r\nfacing  economic  problems and a currency  crisis,  problems  of\r\n\r\ndrought,  shortage of food supplies, medicine,  etc,  and  there\r\n\r\nhave also been reports of sporadic unrest.  However, general law\r\n\r\nand order have been maintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we, in Singapore, must understand and empathise with\r\n\r\nthese  difficulties that the Indonesians are  experiencing.   We\r\n\r\nare  concerned about the difficulties they face and we  will  do\r\n\r\nour best to help them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\novercome their difficulties.  As the Prime Minister has said, it\r\n\r\nis  impossible for Singapore to close our eyes or fold our  arms\r\n\r\nand  ignore the problems of our neighbours.  We should see these\r\n\r\nproblems in perspective.  Taking into consideration factors such\r\n\r\nas their sheer geographical size and large population, Indonesia\r\n\r\nwould need time to tackle the financial crisis and stabilise its\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian government has to handle many competing\r\n\r\npriorities, especially during the current economic difficulties.\r\n\r\nBut  the  problems  the  Indonesian  government  faces  are  not\r\n\r\ninsurmountable.  There are two reasons why I say  this.   First,\r\n\r\nPresident  Suharto has begun his new term as  President  and  he\r\n\r\nremains  in control of the situation.  We are confident that  he\r\n\r\nwill  make  some tough decisions to resolve the current  crisis.\r\n\r\nAs  Prime  Minister  Goh  said  in his  letter  to  congratulate\r\n\r\nPresident  Suharto which was published recently, \"Indonesia  had\r\n\r\nfaced  overwhelming difficulties and widespread poverty  in  the\r\n\r\npast.    But  through  President  Suharto's  strong   will   and\r\n\r\nleadership, Indonesia overcame them.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that the international community has\r\n\r\ncome  forward to assist Indonesia to stabilise its  economy  and\r\n\r\nameliorate  some  of the impact of the financial  crisis.   Yes,\r\n\r\nthere  may be differences in how the problems could be resolved,\r\n\r\nbut  I  believe that all concerned parties want to see Indonesia\r\n\r\nrecover  from  this  crisis by adopting the most  realistic  and\r\n\r\nrational solutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in today's world, we see a series of cross border\r\n\r\nlinkages  bringing  countries  closer  together.   Strengthening\r\n\r\nthese  regional  or  global  linkages  will  be  beneficial  for\r\n\r\neconomic development.  In that regard, Indonesia is a vital link\r\n\r\nin that chain for the region and for Singapore.  Indonesia is  a\r\n\r\nkey  strategic player in the region.  A politically  stable  and\r\n\r\neconomically  sound  Indonesia is therefore  important.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant not only for Singapore, it is important for ASEAN,  it\r\n\r\nis important for the rest of the region and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with these considerations in mind that Singapore has\r\n\r\noffered  a  contribution of US$5 billion loan to  Indonesia,  as\r\n\r\npart of the IMF package.  Prime Minister Goh has also proposed a\r\n\r\nmulti-lateral  trade finance guarantee facility  for  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is awaiting responses from countries to which  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has written, including the  G7  countries   US,\r\n\r\nCanada, Japan, UK, France, Germany, Italy, as well as Australia,\r\n\r\nBrunei, China, Malaysia, the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our assistance alone would not be effective. It\r\n\r\nis  therefore  important  that we work  with  international  and\r\n\r\nregional institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank, the Asian\r\n\r\nDevelopment Bank and other countries to assist Indonesia in  its\r\n\r\neconomic  recovery.  We are a small country.  Our assistance  is\r\n\r\nwithin  the  constraints of our resources, and our US$5  billion\r\n\r\nloan  package  and  our PM's proposal of a  multi-lateral  trade\r\n\r\nfinance guarantee facility for Indonesia should be seen in  that\r\n\r\nlight.   But  Singapore can play a catalytic role  in  proposing\r\n\r\nworkable ideas and getting others to join in doing more to  help\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   In  other words, we try to play  a  supportive  and\r\n\r\nconstructive  role  alongside other countries  to  help  restore\r\n\r\nconfidence to Indonesia and to the region.  I hope that with the\r\n\r\ninternational collective will and cooperation, Indonesia and the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the  region will emerge out of the  regional  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis even stronger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to Dr Tan Boon Wan's comments about the\r\n\r\nprinciple   of   non-interference,  and   how   do   we   tackle\r\n\r\ntransnational problems that affect various countries.   I  would\r\n\r\nrespond that we should and indeed we have always abided  by  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of non-interference in the internal affairs  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  It is a principle that we should always uphold.  But\r\n\r\nthis  does  not preclude countries from helping one  another  or\r\n\r\nformulating new mechanisms, and this was a point Dr Tan Boon Wan\r\n\r\nasked  about  new  mechanisms.  It should not  prevent  us  from\r\n\r\nformulating new mechanisms to ensure that problems like the haze\r\n\r\nor  the  currency crisis do not recur.  In this  respect,  steps\r\n\r\nhave already been taken.  On the issue of the haze, for example,\r\n\r\nMembers have heard my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Minister for the Environment, recently  tell  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that the ASEAN Environment Ministers had met to look  for\r\n\r\nways to solve the problem.  Similarly, in the regional financial\r\n\r\nsituation,  ASEAN  leaders had met in December  to  discuss  the\r\n\r\nissue.  A leaders' statement was subsequently issued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, Singapore has offered its assistance to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have  referred.  Other ASEAN countries have  similarly\r\n\r\nprovided  assistance.  The ASEAN countries have  jointly  sought\r\n\r\nsolutions to the crisis.  Under the Manila Framework, six  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries   Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines,  Singapore\r\n\r\nand Thailand  together with other Asia-Pacific countries such as\r\n\r\nUS,  China,  Korea,  Hong  Kong and Australia  have  agreed,  as\r\n\r\nMembers would have read in the press, on the need for a regional\r\n\r\nsurveillance mechanism for early detection of problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are indeed mechanisms for regional countries to\r\n\r\ndeal with such problems.  But to be realistic, I must admit that\r\n\r\nwe  cannot guarantee that such problems would not recur as there\r\n\r\nare so many factors and causes involved.  On its part, Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  work  with the other countries to see how these mechanisms\r\n\r\ncan be strengthened in the future.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I turn to the two related questions asked by Mr\r\n\r\nShriniwas  Rai  about MFA's policy of diplomatic relations.   He\r\n\r\nurged  that we have diplomatic relations with as many  countries\r\n\r\nin the world as possible.  It is very difficult to disagree with\r\n\r\nthe  objectives  that  he  urges upon the  Ministry  of  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs.    Presently,  Singapore  has  established   diplomatic\r\n\r\nrelations   with   some  149  countries.   I   would   say   our\r\n\r\nconsiderations for establishing diplomatic ties are  three-fold:\r\n\r\nfirst,  sometimes  we  are approached by another  government  to\r\n\r\nestablish  formal  diplomatic  ties.   Second,  to  do   so   is\r\n\r\nconsistent  with  our policy of cultivating  a  constituency  of\r\n\r\nsupport from countries which are responsive to our interests  at\r\n\r\nthe  UN and other international forums.  Third, where we do  not\r\n\r\nhave  significant  bilateral relations with  other  governments,\r\n\r\nthere is merit in cultivating relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I should explain to Mr Shriniwas Rai that in today's\r\n\r\nworld  of  diplomacy, the formality of entering into  diplomatic\r\n\r\nrelations is really not a condition precedent, i.  It is not  an\r\n\r\nobstacle  or a bar to having interactions and having to  conduct\r\n\r\nvarious relations with those countries.  In other words, it is a\r\n\r\nformality that does not prevent visits, discussions and  so  on.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many  ways  in  which this  interaction  with  other\r\n\r\ncountries can be achieved, trade and economic linkages,  people-to-people  contact  and mutual support in international  forums.\r\n\r\nSo  the  fact that we may not have formal diplomatic  ties  with\r\n\r\nsome  countries  has never precluded us.  Indeed,  many  of  the\r\n\r\nForeign Ministers and other leaders have come to Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nsome  of  them  are from countries where we do not  have  formal\r\n\r\ndiplomatic ties.  I am not sure whether Mr Shriniwas Rai had  in\r\n\r\nmind the formal act or whether he meant actually establishing  a\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  presence,  which  is of  course  a  different  thing\r\n\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1990, Singapore has formalised diplomatic relations\r\n\r\nwith  some  52  countries.  At the same time, we have  developed\r\n\r\nties   with  many  other  countries  with  which  we  have   not\r\n\r\nestablished the formal act of diplomatic relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about roving ambassadors. But in asking that\r\n\r\nquestion, he was cognisant of the fact that, as a small country,\r\n\r\nwith  a developing foreign service, we just cannot have resident\r\n\r\nambassadors in many parts of the world.  So we establish a  non-resident ambassadors or roving ambassadors scheme as a means  of\r\n\r\nexpanding our diplomatic representation abroad.  When we appoint\r\n\r\nnon-resident  ambassadors, we do so after careful  selection  of\r\n\r\nsuitably qualified candidates.  I take his point that we  should\r\n\r\ntry to expand and build on this roving ambassadors.  We will try\r\n\r\nto  do  so, but before the Government appoints more non-resident\r\n\r\nambassadors, we must ensure that we have the candidates who  can\r\n\r\nadequately  and effectively represent the interest of  Singapore\r\n\r\nin  the country of accreditation.  I should say that since  1991\r\n\r\nwe  have  appointed 14 non-resident or roving  ambassadors,  and\r\n\r\nbetween the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14  roving ambassadors they cover 37 countries in Asia,  Europe,\r\n\r\nLatin America and Africa and the Pacific.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am obliged to\r\n\r\nyou  for  your  permission  to join in  the  discussion  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Foreign Affairs' budget.  My cut  relates  to  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations.  Specifically, it is a suggestion  to  increase\r\n\r\nSingapore's  financial contributions to United  Nations  and  UN\r\n\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has risen in international profile. It has\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  increasing  political leadership  internationally,\r\n\r\ncommensurate with our economic development in the last  decades.\r\n\r\nThe  respect and success for our small nation has arisen because\r\n\r\nof  our  pertinence, or relevance, and our  competence.   It  is\r\n\r\nalso,  largely  due  to  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  in\r\n\r\nrepresenting us abroad.  The United Nations has been  emphasized\r\n\r\nby this Government as having a central role in giving a voice to\r\n\r\nsmaller  states like ours.  And Singapore, from my observations,\r\n\r\nhas  paid a constructive, helpful and supportive role at  United\r\n\r\nNations  and  other  international fora.  There  is  every  good\r\n\r\nreason for Singapore to aim for a non-permanent Security Council\r\n\r\nseat  in  the  UN.  Support, of course, Sir, has  many  aspects,\r\n\r\nincluding  financial, which I am emphasising today.   I  respect\r\n\r\nthat  our first contribution must be in work and ideas.  I  come\r\n\r\nto my question: should we contribute more on finance?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, Singapore has had a good record in paying up on\r\n\r\nour  asscessed  contributions.  I turn then  to  our  record  in\r\n\r\nvoluntary contributions.  In reply to a question I submitted  at\r\n\r\na  previous sitting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has  kindly\r\n\r\ngiven  us  a 10-year series of how much Singapore has  given  to\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations organisations.  Sir, to sum up the table,  which\r\n\r\nis  in the records of Parliament, baseding on the last 10 years,\r\n\r\nin   1988  we  gave  the  figure  of  US$305,230  only  to   one\r\n\r\ninstitution,  United Nations Development Programme.   Ten  years\r\n\r\non, we gave US$390,000 to three organisations, again the bulk of\r\n\r\nUS$300,000 to the United\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNations  Development  Programme.  Sir,  these  figures  are  not\r\n\r\nadjusted for inflation and I think they show consistent, but  if\r\n\r\nI   may   say,  stagnant  contribution,  which  is   no   longer\r\n\r\ncommensurate  with our increase in international  standing,  our\r\n\r\nscope,  the  way  we play, and our ambitions over  the  last  10\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that this financial year will see an\r\n\r\nincrease.  Hence, my cut.  My proposal is that the sum should be\r\n\r\nincreased to agencies whose work is relevant to us, or  that  we\r\n\r\nsupport in principle.  This is not a legal obligation but, if  I\r\n\r\nmay  say,   a moral expectation of what countries should  do  as\r\n\r\nthey  rise  in  international standing  and  economic  progress.\r\n\r\nDeveloped  countries, as the Minister knows,  set  a  target  of\r\n\r\nofficial  assistance  at  0.7%.   I am not  saying  that  figure\r\n\r\nshould  apply  to  us.  But I do urge the Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\nsetting  a base and then perhaps to increase it yearly according\r\n\r\nto our own growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, my cut relates to the idea that specific agencies\r\n\r\nshould  be  better supported, in particular the  United  Nations\r\n\r\nEnvironment  Programme.  Nothing is given in terms of  voluntary\r\n\r\ncontributions to this programme.  This programme  is  much  less\r\n\r\nfunded  than the United Nations Development Programme, which  we\r\n\r\nlargely  gave  to.   Yet, UNEP is of growing  relevance  to  the\r\n\r\ninternational community and Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, Singapore joined in the four-country\r\n\r\ninitiative   for  the  environment  under  the   leadership   of\r\n\r\nChancellor  Kohl of  Germany.  With these other three countries,\r\n\r\nSingapore has joined in calling for UNEP to play a larger  role.\r\n\r\nUNEP  is  also  providing assistance to  have  an  international\r\n\r\nconference in Singapore that will focus on model cities of which\r\n\r\nI  and  others  believe Singapore is a good example.   UNEP  has\r\n\r\nalready  provided  assistance for the regional seas'  programme,\r\n\r\nwhich  Singapore benefits from, being a major port in this area.\r\n\r\nVery recently, the new Executive Director of UNEP has called for\r\n\r\nthis   institution  to  play  a  central  role   in   organising\r\n\r\ninternational   attention  and  action  on  the  regional   haze\r\n\r\npollution, a problem that affects us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I urge the Minister to consider that\r\n\r\nSingapore  should increase voluntary financial contributions  to\r\n\r\nthe  United  Nations  as a whole, and United  Nations  agencies,\r\n\r\nespecially UNEP.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> With your permission, Sir, may I seek two\r\n\r\nclarifications from the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the House agrees with the Minister's assessment of\r\n\r\nthe  situation with Malaysia.  I think Mr Chiam's suggestion  is\r\n\r\nworthy  of  consideration and we should seriously  consider  it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Government  may  want  to  set  up  a  Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  to study how we could bring about an economic  union,\r\n\r\nprovided  the Malaysians are of the same mind.  In the  interest\r\n\r\nof both countries, we should start afresh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the Prime Minister's regular visits to\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   So  are  the Foreign Minister and  other  Ministers.\r\n\r\nCould  we  institutionalise these visits?  We are  coming  to  a\r\n\r\nstage  where  we  do not have many Ministers  in  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nCabinet  who  have  studied in Singapore.   There  are   younger\r\n\r\nMinisters  who have never been to either a Singapore  school  or\r\n\r\nuniversity.   So  it is important, both for the governments  and\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants, to have regular dialogues.  As neighbours,\r\n\r\nwe  may  have our problem, but we should look at the  long  term\r\n\r\nperspective in the interest of both countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> First, let me reply to Mr Simon Tay.\r\n\r\nThere  are  various ways in which you can look at the extent  of\r\n\r\nour  contributions  to  United  Nations  organisations,  whether\r\n\r\nmandatory or voluntary contributions.  The way Mr Simon Tay  has\r\n\r\nlooked  at it, he thinks it is not adequate and not commensurate\r\n\r\nwith  our  position or status and he, therefore,  calls  for  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  contributions.  But in case he believes  that  our\r\n\r\ncontributions are inadequate, I would present a different way of\r\n\r\nlooking  at  it.  The fact is, firstly, we have over  the  years\r\n\r\nincreased our contributions.  But when we contribute, we  do  so\r\n\r\nnot  in order to solve the financial problems of that particular\r\n\r\ninternational organisation but, more importantly, to demonstrate\r\n\r\nSingapore's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport for that organisation for what they are doing and it  is\r\n\r\nmore  symbolic  of  support  and hopefully  will  trigger  other\r\n\r\ncountries to do so.  Really, large contributions have to be made\r\n\r\nby other countries.  Let us remember that we are a small country\r\n\r\nand  we  have  to  be realistic as to how much we  can  actually\r\n\r\ncontribute to international organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the 1997 UN handbook, there are more than 37\r\n\r\norganisations within the UN system, and if you look at the  Year\r\n\r\nBook  of  International  Organisations, there  are  some  13,600\r\n\r\ninternational organisations.  Clearly, it is not possible for us\r\n\r\nto   make  contributions  to  so  many  organisations.   So  our\r\n\r\napproach  is: be selective, do what we can within our resources,\r\n\r\nand  the objective is to show support for the UN system and  for\r\n\r\nthose organisations.  In that sense, we have traditionally  made\r\n\r\nvoluntary contributions to a number of UN related IOs, including\r\n\r\nthe UN Children's Fund, the UN Fund for  Women and the UNDP.  We\r\n\r\nhave  gradually increased it over the years.  It may not  be  of\r\n\r\nthe  frequency and the magnitude that Mr Simon Tay  would  want.\r\n\r\nBut  I  believe we have demonstrated Singapore's willingness  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the international community as a country  that  is\r\n\r\nmindful  of  our  role  and willing to perform  our  role  as  a\r\n\r\nresponsible member of the UN.  But to look at it really, we must\r\n\r\nnot forget that we also make contributions in other forms, which\r\n\r\nare  very  difficult to quantify.  But if you ask the Ministries\r\n\r\nand  the Ministry of Finance,  they can quantify it in terms  of\r\n\r\ncosts.   Our participation in UN related activities like  peace-keeping  operations,  that  is an important  contribution.   But\r\n\r\nagain, this is to show support for the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay just now referred to the fact that we are\r\n\r\nholding workshops, seminars and conferences.  Indeed, we do hold\r\n\r\nconferences.   For the past three years, I have  been  guest-of-honour  at  seminars  and  workshops hosted  in  Singapore,  for\r\n\r\nexample, on peace-keeping.  There are certain  costs involved in\r\n\r\nhosting that seminar.  I am sure that if I add up all the costs,\r\n\r\nhospitality,  the  reception  we  have  given  and   the   local\r\n\r\ntransportation costs for all these conferences and workshops,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey can add to these figures, which I have not done so.  But it\r\n\r\nis  a relevant factor.  It again shows our support.  In terms of\r\n\r\nshowing  our  willingness to perform our role, because  we  have\r\n\r\ndone  comparatively better than some other developing countries,\r\n\r\nlet  us  not  forget  our technical assistance  programmes.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, it is not a programme for contributions to international\r\n\r\norganisations, but it shows your foreign policy stand, and under\r\n\r\nour Singapore Cooperation Programme, which is bilateral, as well\r\n\r\nas  through schemes which we tie up with other organisations and\r\n\r\ncountries, including the UNDP, World Bank, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, we have trained some 6,000 participants from 92\r\n\r\ndeveloping   countries,   under  various   types   of   training\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   I think this is an important part of your  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  objective.   How  else do you  support  the  UN  system?\r\n\r\nBecause  that is the way I look at it - contributions to support\r\n\r\nthe UN system.  I think we contribute to the UN system by paying\r\n\r\nour  contributions  on  time.  And I  hope  Mr  Simon  Tay  will\r\n\r\nsometimes  make  a  call for bigger nations,  whom  I  will  not\r\n\r\nmention  specifically, to pay their contributions on time.   For\r\n\r\n1997,  we paid US$1.7 million as our excess contribution to  the\r\n\r\nUN's  regular budget, and US$314,000 to the peacekeeping budget.\r\n\r\nOur   voluntary   contribution   to   UN-related   international\r\n\r\norganisations  was about US$317,000.  Is it  a  lot?   Is  it  a\r\n\r\nlittle?   It  depends  on how you look at  it.   It  was  a  27%\r\n\r\nincrease from our contributions in 1996.  Another US$182,000 was\r\n\r\nmade   to   non-related   international   organisations.     Our\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  peacekeeping operations is  about  S$159,000.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  Singapore Cooperation Programme, which I referred  to,\r\n\r\namounts to S$10 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if you look at it in financial terms,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  contribution,  voluntary  and  mandatory,  just  as\r\n\r\nadministered by the Foreign Ministry - I emphasise that  because\r\n\r\nsome  other Ministries have similar programmes - was in the tune\r\n\r\nof some S$15 million for 1997.  As I said,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  than  MFA,  we have contributions to the  UN  Environment\r\n\r\nProgramme.  I take note that Mr Simon Tay would like this to  be\r\n\r\nincreased.  In 1997, we contributed US$15,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from these contributions, I should also mention\r\n\r\nthere  are specific funds, such as the UNEP Trust Fund for East-Asian Seas.  For 1998, we contributed US$10,000.  And I am  told\r\n\r\nthat  the National Parks Board has also contributed S$15,000  to\r\n\r\nthe  Convention  on  Biological Diversity.   Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  contributed  $10,577  for  the  Convention   on\r\n\r\nInternational  Trade in Endangered Species  of  Wild  Fauna  and\r\n\r\nFlora.  I do not know what else can be discovered from the other\r\n\r\nMinistries.  But the point I want to make is, again, that,  yes,\r\n\r\nwe  can increase our contributions but we always have to bear in\r\n\r\nmind  our  position and our resources.  And I think  within  the\r\n\r\nconstraints of our small size and limited resources, we have not\r\n\r\ndone badly in terms of our contributions to the UN system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Rai's comments on the economic union, I have nothing\r\n\r\nfurther  to  add than what I have said to Mr Chiam, and  I  have\r\n\r\ntaken note of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to institutionalising links, there are various shapes\r\n\r\nand forms in which countries can conduct relations.  And I think\r\n\r\nbetween  Malaysia and Singapore, it is very fair for me  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the different Ministries and different agencies have  very\r\n\r\ngood  contacts with each other.  The Ministers have good working\r\n\r\nrelations, not just with the Foreign Ministry, but also with the\r\n\r\ncommunications,  as  well  departments  like  the   Police   and\r\n\r\nImmigration  under the charge of my colleague, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs.  This has evolved over a period of years.  Do  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  change  it and have some institutional  system?   Some\r\n\r\ncountries  have  what  they call joint  commissions  which  meet\r\n\r\nannually  at  specific dates.  So there are  various  forms.   I\r\n\r\nthink  from  my viewpoint, as Foreign Minister,  I  am  open  to\r\n\r\nsuggestions.   But  I  will pay emphasis to  the  substance  and\r\n\r\nresults, rather than form.  You can have form.  But it will be a\r\n\r\npity if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe have the form and elaborate structures, tremendous numbers of\r\n\r\nmeetings, but at the end of the day, very few results.

Just  this morning, on the  front  page  of  The\r\n\r\nStraits  Times, there is a report of some 200 illegal immigrants\r\n\r\nof  various nationalities who were apprehended.  The problem  is\r\n\r\nnot confined to Singapore.  There are continuing reports on this\r\n\r\nsimilar  issue  in  Malaysia almost  on  a  daily  basis.   This\r\n\r\nmorning, The Straits Times showed most graphically the situation\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia  headlined, \"Foreigners caught in  garbage  truck\".\r\n\r\nThey  even  come in garbage trucks.  The following article  also\r\n\r\nreported that Malaysia is urging Indonesia to act on this issue,\r\n\r\nas  presumably a large number of illegal immigrants in  Malaysia\r\n\r\nare from Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tightening up in Malaysia, combined with the\r\n\r\nslowdown in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomies of neighbouring countries and the increasing number of\r\n\r\nunemployed,  the problem in Singapore looks set  to  get  worse.\r\n\r\nThis  is  worrying.   As  the economy in  Indonesia  is  set  to\r\n\r\ndecline,  going by press reports, the problem must be contained.\r\n\r\nWhilst  the  success  of  the police raids  is  commendable  and\r\n\r\ncomforting,   the  substantial  number  of  illegal   immigrants\r\n\r\napprehended  in the last few police raids, in fact,  means  that\r\n\r\nthis is just the tip of the iceberg.  There must be a large pool\r\n\r\nof illegal immigrants and overstayers in our midst.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Singapore is not a large island, the coastline is\r\n\r\nlong  and  one can imagine the difficulties the Police  must  be\r\n\r\nfacing  in  trying  to stop the tide of those seeking  to  enter\r\n\r\nSingapore illegally.  I have no doubt that the Police  is  doing\r\n\r\nits utmost to contain or arrest the problem.  On the legal side,\r\n\r\nemployers  must be educated that this is a serious  problem  and\r\n\r\nthat  one  should not encourage illegal immigrants by  employing\r\n\r\nthem.   Despite  hefty penalties, there are  employers  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared to flout the law.  On enforcement, the Police should be\r\n\r\nwell  equipped  with manpower and equipment, especially  in  the\r\n\r\nseas,  to  prevent illegal entry.  Once they land  on  shore  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  in  our  midst, the  chance  of  detection  and\r\n\r\napprehension diminishes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure all Members support me when I say that the Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  Ministry  should get a higher vote,  if  necessary,  to\r\n\r\nimplement programmes to counter this problem.  The Minister  may\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure the House and Singaporeans on the  steps  being\r\n\r\ntaken to contain this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the current financial\r\n\r\nturmoil  and  economic crisis are forcing many people  from  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries  to  flee hyper-inflation,  severe  food\r\n\r\nshortages and unemployment which are affecting them in their own\r\n\r\nland.   They may be attracted to Singapore which is only a short\r\n\r\nboat  ride  away.   In  the early hours  of  24th  February,  12\r\n\r\nsuspected  illegal immigrants were arrested in  the  waters  off\r\n\r\nChangi.   The police spokesman stated that this was the  largest\r\n\r\nnumber  arrested at sea for trying to enter Singapore  illegally\r\n\r\nfrom the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsouth.   The  Police  also reported that  the  total  number  of\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants caught at sea for the first  two  months  of\r\n\r\nthis  year stands at 39, compared to 84 for the whole  of  1997.\r\n\r\nThis  number  seems  incredibly small compared  to  the  numbers\r\n\r\nreported  in  Malaysia  where  3,971  illegal  immigrants   were\r\n\r\narrested  in a three-week period last month.  No doubt, Malaysia\r\n\r\nis  a  bigger  country with a longer coastline,  swampy  coastal\r\n\r\nmarshes  and deserted shorelines which all serve as good landing\r\n\r\npoints.   But I wonder whether, apart from the relatively  small\r\n\r\nnumber  who  has been arrested so far, there were other  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants who have managed to avoid arrest and slip through our\r\n\r\nsurveillance net to land on shore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to formulate a comprehensive and effective\r\n\r\napproach  to  prevent,  detain,  and  deal  with  such  economic\r\n\r\nmigrants.    We   must   formulate  a  realistic   approach   in\r\n\r\nanticipation  and  in  the event of a  mass  exodus  of  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants from our neighbouring countries.  Are we able to cope\r\n\r\nshould large numbers of foreigners turn up in our waters?  If we\r\n\r\nare  to arrest and imprison them, can our prisons house and feed\r\n\r\nall of them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the problem should be approached from at\r\n\r\nleast  four different angles.  The first is to nip the Taikongs,\r\n\r\nor  boatmen, who exploit the desperation of these foreigners  by\r\n\r\nsmuggling  them to Singapore for a fee.  If found  guilty,  they\r\n\r\nshould be given heavy deterrent penalties, including jail terms,\r\n\r\ncaning,  confiscation  of their boats, so  as  to  cut  off  the\r\n\r\nprovision  for  this  ferry service and  to  deter  others  from\r\n\r\noffering  it.  We might pity the illegal immigrant who is  often\r\n\r\ndriven  by  deprivation and turmoil back home to risk  venturing\r\n\r\noverseas.  But no pity should be given to the boatmen  who  seek\r\n\r\nto profit from the desperation of others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, surveillance of our coastlines and onshore patrols\r\n\r\nmust  be  stepped up.  This requires the coordinated efforts  of\r\n\r\nthe   Police   Coast  Guards,  the  Navy  and  the   Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, citizens should be vigilant and look out for illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  in their neighbourhoods.  Any suspicious  characters\r\n\r\nshould be reported to the Police for their identification to  be\r\n\r\nverified  and, if found to be not in order, to be arrested.   If\r\n\r\nlarge numbers of foreign workers are known to be congregating in\r\n\r\nany particular place in Singapore, combined operations should be\r\n\r\nmounted to check on them and round them up.  And those who  have\r\n\r\ncome  in  illegally  or  have overstayed should  be  dealt  with\r\n\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, residents who harbour and provide refuge for\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants should be severely punished.  We have to also\r\n\r\ntrack  down  illegal  immigrants  who  make  use  of  make-shift\r\n\r\naccommodation  in the nature reserves and other deserted  areas.\r\n\r\nTo address this problem, a combined operation by the Police, and\r\n\r\nperhaps the army, should be launched to flush them out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crisis and turmoil in the region would inevitably\r\n\r\nlead to more illegal immigrants trying to land on our shores. We\r\n\r\nshould  not  think that that is not a big problem as the  number\r\n\r\narrested  so far is small.  Many might have slipped through.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  this  problem  is potentially serious  and  warrants  a\r\n\r\nconcerted multi-pronged approach to deal with it effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, in addition to\r\n\r\nthe  usual illegal immigrants we have from time to time from the\r\n\r\ntraditional foreign workers market, we can expect a  big  influx\r\n\r\nof   illegal  immigrants  for  the  next  few  years  from   our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries  who have been  badly  affected  by  the\r\n\r\ncurrent economic turmoil.  It will no doubt cause a great strain\r\n\r\nto the Police Department's resources to deal with this situation\r\n\r\nas  Singapore is an island and the task of patrolling our shores\r\n\r\nwould be much more difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As illegal immigrants not only cause social problems, but\r\n\r\nmore importantly,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  will present security problems that involve the safety  of\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans, I hope the Ministry can take early preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  tighten security and coordinate with  perhaps  the\r\n\r\narmed  forces who can patrol the outlying areas and  the  forest\r\n\r\nareas, the navy who can help to patrol our shoreline, and  other\r\n\r\nlaw  enforcement agencies like the Immigration Department  could\r\n\r\ntighten  control  of the influx of these immigrants  to  prevent\r\n\r\nanyone from entering Singapore illegally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who may have slipped through our first line of\r\n\r\ndefence,  I  suggest that, apart from continual  raids  or  even\r\n\r\nintensified vigilance on construction sites, factories and other\r\n\r\nworkplaces,  the  Police Department can work  with  the  various\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations, especially  the  Neighbourhood  Watch\r\n\r\nGroups  to  alert  residents in the HDB estates  to  notify  the\r\n\r\nPolice   as  soon  as  they  detect  any  strangers  who  behave\r\n\r\nsuspiciously  and,  more  so, speak no  local  languages.   They\r\n\r\nshould also send continuous reminders to contractors and factory\r\n\r\noperators  of  the serious consequence if they  are  found  with\r\n\r\nillegal  workers.   This is perhaps the most  effective  way  to\r\n\r\nminimise illegal immigrants to Singapore because if they  cannot\r\n\r\nfind work here, there is no reason for them to take the risk  of\r\n\r\nbeing  caught.   I hope the Ministry can give the assurance  and\r\n\r\nenlighten us on what other plans it has to keep Singapore a safe\r\n\r\nand peaceful place for all of us to live in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, other Members\r\n\r\nin  the  House have already spoken about the expected influx  of\r\n\r\nimmigrants  from neighbouring countries.  Today, we  have  heard\r\n\r\nthat  over  300 illegal immigrants have been picked  up  in  one\r\n\r\noperation alone last night.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, The Straits Times reported a story from Newsweek\r\n\r\nthat  an  official from a neighbouring country made  the  remark\r\n\r\nthat  even  if  10 million people were to leave for neighbouring\r\n\r\nshores in their boats, they will not be stopped.  That is a very\r\n\r\nscary  statement.  Even if 1% of that 10 million  were  to  gain\r\n\r\nentry into Singapore, we would face very serious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems.   Crime control measures may have to be  increased  to\r\n\r\nlevels  as  yet  unknown and could adversely affect  our  social\r\n\r\nlife.   I  believe that all of us in this House would very  much\r\n\r\nlike  to know what are the steps that are needed to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthis   does  not  happen.   Do  we  have  the  resources?   More\r\n\r\nimportantly, do we have the will to deal firmly and sternly with\r\n\r\nthose who intend to come in illegally?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be very difficult to be strict. We naturally\r\n\r\nsympathise with those who are in extreme distress.  We  remember\r\n\r\nthe anguish of the world for the Vietnamese boat people.  It  is\r\n\r\nnatural to want to help people in distress.  But I believe  that\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  we have to stand firm.  We already  have  around\r\n\r\n450,000 foreign workers who are working here legally.  Land  and\r\n\r\nresources  are in short supply.  Frankly, I believe we  have  no\r\n\r\nchoice.  I have every confidence that the Minsiter would be in a\r\n\r\nposition to assure us that effective steps would be put in place\r\n\r\nto  control  the  influx of illegal immigrants  into  Singapore,\r\n\r\ndealing with them firmly but decently.  Singaporeans would  need\r\n\r\nto  know why we need to take such firm steps.  Quite simply,  it\r\n\r\nis  to  preserve our way of life, to protect all  that  we  have\r\n\r\nworked  for  over  these years, that is, in short,  what  is  at\r\n\r\nstake.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  reply  to this question of  illegal  immigrants\r\n\r\nraised  by  four Members first, because I think  it  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant topic for all of us in today's climate where there  is\r\n\r\na  regional  economic  downturn and that  there  is  a  fear  of\r\n\r\npotential  influx of illegal immigrants.  But,  first,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to assure Members that the Home Affairs Ministry is  fully\r\n\r\naware  of  this problem and has been dealing with  it  for  some\r\n\r\ntime.  I also want to thank Mr Chng for his support for a higher\r\n\r\nvote for the Ministry of Home Affairs.  I think my colleague  in\r\n\r\nthe   Finance  Ministry  will  hear  him  loud  and  clear  and,\r\n\r\nhopefully, his plea would be answered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, let me first say that Singapore welcomes all\r\n\r\nforeigners to come here to work, visit, play or even  to  study.\r\n\r\nBut  they  must  come through legal channels.  \"Legal  channels\"\r\n\r\nmean they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  come  with proper papers and travel documents.  When  they\r\n\r\ncome  here for a visit, they apply for a social visit pass.   If\r\n\r\nthey work here, they apply for an employment pass, a work permit\r\n\r\nor other documents, such as a student pass if they want to study\r\n\r\nhere.   If  they come in with these documents, we  will  endorse\r\n\r\ntheir  stay  here.  Then, lawfully, they will be  residents  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  For those who want to come in by other means, then I\r\n\r\nthink it would be very difficult for them not to be detected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have taken and will continue to take a very tough\r\n\r\nstand against all the illegal immigrants and overstayers, and  I\r\n\r\ngroup   all  these  people  as  immigration  offenders.    These\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders could also include their  smugglers,  the\r\n\r\nTaikongs, as mentioned by Mr Ong Kian Min.  There are also ,  or\r\n\r\nthe  harbourers (the ones who allow them to live in their homes)\r\n\r\nor the employers of these people who give them jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain why we cannot afford to be lax or kind to\r\n\r\nthese  illegal  immigrants.  Singapore is a very  small  country\r\n\r\nwith  limited  natural  resources.  We  therefore  cannot  allow\r\n\r\npeople to come here just to stay and work illegally.  They  will\r\n\r\npose  a  very  serious and grave national, social  and  security\r\n\r\nproblem  for us.  We therefore have enacted very tough  laws  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  these illegal immigrants and overstayers.   We  will\r\n\r\nenforce these laws vigorously which we will apply equally  to\r\n\r\nall  nationalities regardless of where they come from.  If  they\r\n\r\ncome  here  illegally or prolong their stay here  illegally,  we\r\n\r\nwill deal with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishments prescribed under our laws are very severe.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  illegal immigrants will be  imprisoned  up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  six  months  and will be given  a  mandatory  three\r\n\r\nstrokes of the cane.  Overstayers will also be imprisoned up  to\r\n\r\nsix  months,  and if they overstay for more than 90  days,  they\r\n\r\nwill  also be subject to a minimum of three strokes of the cane.\r\n\r\nWe  will  be  deliberately tough on those  who  smuggle  in  the\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Taikongs, the people who employ them, harbour them or  give\r\n\r\nthem  accommodation.   These smugglers  will  be  punished  with\r\n\r\nimprisonment of not less than two years and caned a  minimum  of\r\n\r\nthree  strokes.  Those who harbour and employ illegal immigrants\r\n\r\nwill  be jailed for a term not less than six months and fined  a\r\n\r\nmaximum of $6,000.  But for those employers who employ more than\r\n\r\nfive  immigration  offenders, whether they  are  overstayers  or\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants, they will be imprisoned not less  than  six\r\n\r\nmonths  and  fined  not exceeding $6,000 and  caned.   Since  we\r\n\r\namended  the Immigration Act in 1989, many employers  have  been\r\n\r\ncaned.   In  fact,  since we tightened this up  in  1996,  seven\r\n\r\nemployers have been caned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the same reason that we are a small country with\r\n\r\nlimited  natural resources, Singapore is also not in a  position\r\n\r\nto  accept anyone who claims to be a refugee, whether he  is  an\r\n\r\neconomic  or  a  political  refugee.   We  could  otherwise   be\r\n\r\noverwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people who want to come here\r\n\r\nand  claiming themselves to be refugees.  Therefore, anyone  who\r\n\r\nenters Singapore's territorial waters illegally will be regarded\r\n\r\nas  an illegal immigrant and he will be treated accordingly.  If\r\n\r\nthey  come  in through to our waters illegally, we will  try  to\r\n\r\nstop  them.  If they refuse to stop, then we will have no choice\r\n\r\nbut  to use force to stop them.  Prof Chin asked whether we have\r\n\r\nthe will to do so.  Yes, let me assure him that we have the will\r\n\r\nand  the  Police Coast Guard (PCG) will have the  will  to  stop\r\n\r\nthese people from coming in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, we have been kind enough to agree to take\r\n\r\nin   Vietnamese  refugees  with  third  country  guarantees  for\r\n\r\nresettlement.  And for years, we were saddled with them  because\r\n\r\nthese  third  countries which agreed to resettle  them  did  not\r\n\r\nhonour  their guarantees.  Eventually, when the camp had  to  be\r\n\r\nclosed,  these Vietnamese had to be sent back.  We  have  learnt\r\n\r\nour  lesson and we will no longer accept any refugee even  if  a\r\n\r\nthird country promises to resettle them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give Members some idea of how serious the\r\n\r\nproblem is by quoting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  following numbers.  In 1997, 13,910 immigration  offenders,\r\n\r\nof  whom 7,600 were illegal immigrants, were arrested.  In 1996,\r\n\r\n14,260   immigration  offenders,  of  whom  5,710  were  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants, were arrested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the number of immigration offenders arrested as a\r\n\r\nwhole  dropped by 2.5% in 1997, the number of illegal immigrants\r\n\r\narrested  during the period has gone up from 5,710  in  1996  to\r\n\r\n7,600  in 1997.  This is because Singapore Immigration tightened\r\n\r\nup the entry requirement for some nationalities.  Of the illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  arrested  in 1997, the top five  nationalities  came\r\n\r\nfrom  China,  that  is,  PRC, Indonesia, Myanmar,  Thailand  and\r\n\r\nIndia.   In other words, not all came from the South,  that  is,\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   The  number  of  illegal  immigrants  has  gone  up\r\n\r\nsignificantly  mainly through Malaysia.  They  came  across  the\r\n\r\nStraits of Johor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half or 53% of the illegal immigrants came in\r\n\r\nfrom  the sea, 46% came in by land and less than 1% claimed that\r\n\r\nthey  came by air.  For those who came by land, in 1997,  nearly\r\n\r\n400   illegal  immigrants  sneaked  in  through  the   Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoint  by hiding in lorries, while about 200 hid themselves\r\n\r\nin  the  car boots.  And many more came by speed boats over  the\r\n\r\nStraits of Johor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, joint efforts are needed between the Singapore Police\r\n\r\nand  the Malaysian Police to tackle this problem.  The Singapore\r\n\r\nPolice has sought the Malaysian Police's cooperation to stem out\r\n\r\nthis  illegal immigration problem.  Both the Police Forces  have\r\n\r\nalready  met  and discussed the problem and they have  exchanged\r\n\r\ninformation on the syndicated operations and the staging  points\r\n\r\nwhere  both  forces  can  cooperate to weed  out  these  illegal\r\n\r\nentries.   We hope that the Malaysian government will take  this\r\n\r\nproblem seriously and deal effectively with the syndicates which\r\n\r\nsmuggle  illegal immigrants into Singapore from Johor,  just  as\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian government is very concerned about the Indonesian\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants and they have taken up with  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\ngovernment to solve this problem.  The Malaysian government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknows  the  seriousness of the problem they  face  with  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants from other countries, especially from Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this illegal immigrant problem is likely to get worse, I\r\n\r\nhave  asked the Police and the Singapore Immigration to be  even\r\n\r\nmore  vigilant and to step up their enforcement action.  Let  me\r\n\r\nnow outline or explain what these actions are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Increased Vigilance</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some Members pointed out, our first line of defence\r\n\r\nis  our  coastal front where we will enhance our patrols by  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Coast Guard.  The Police Coast Guard will  do  this\r\n\r\nwith  radar  surveillance systems.  That  will  help  to\r\n\r\ndetect all those who come by sea all round our island.  I  think\r\n\r\nsome  Members may have seen this on television a few weeks  ago.\r\n\r\nThe  radars  on  board  the PCG can detect  any  penetration  of\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants on vessels from the sea.  PCG also has  land\r\n\r\nbased radar stations to supplement the patrol boats and we  will\r\n\r\nbuy more patrol boats to increase the detection of these illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants.  Police has also stepped up  shore patrols  and  set\r\n\r\nup  observation  points, as some Members  suggested,  along  the\r\n\r\ncoast  and  at  landing areas.  Police Land Divisions  are  also\r\n\r\ndeploying  more  men  to  patrol the illegal  immigrant  landing\r\n\r\npoints.  The Police Coast Guard has also increased deployment of\r\n\r\nits  patrol  boats in the Johor Straits and in  the  Straits  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.    The  police  has  also  stepped  up   intelligence\r\n\r\ngathering, because we just do not act without information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Ministry empathizes with these poor hungry people\r\n\r\nwho  want  to come here to work illegally, and they  risk  their\r\n\r\nlives  to  come a long way,  we cannot afford to allow  them  to\r\n\r\ncome  in.  Our primary responsibility is to safeguard the safety\r\n\r\nand  security of all Singaporeans, and not let anyone  come  and\r\n\r\nremain  here  illegally to work, as they  will  pose  a  serious\r\n\r\nsocial and security problem for us.

Some Members have\r\n\r\nread about this in the papers in the last few days.   Checks and\r\n\r\nraids  have  been  conducted regularly at  congregation  points,\r\n\r\nconstruction sites, workplaces and even  forested areas, because\r\n\r\nthey  could  be a good hiding place for criminals.  Police  have\r\n\r\nalso  set  up  road  blocks to sieve out immigration  offenders.\r\n\r\nLodging  houses are also being targetted and harbourers will  be\r\n\r\nprosecuted.  An island-wide operation was conducted just  a  few\r\n\r\ndays  ago  which resulted in the arrest of 91 illegal immigrants\r\n\r\nand  124  overstayers of various nationalities.  Another island-wide operation lasting  two days also resulted in the arrest  of\r\n\r\nmore  than 200 illegal immigrants and overstayers.  We will  ask\r\n\r\nthe courts for maximum sentences for these employers, harbourers\r\n\r\nand immigration offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that Police and Immigration will\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  their  relentless effort in enforcement  against\r\n\r\nthese  immigration  offenders, and we will  flush  them  out  as\r\n\r\nquickly as we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tighter Border Control</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreigners, who come to Singapore and who fit the profile\r\n\r\nof  suspected illegal workers, will not be allowed to come  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.   In 1996, 97,710 such people who fit the profile  of\r\n\r\nsuspected illegal workers were denied entry into Singapore.   In\r\n\r\n1997,   92,400  such  people  were  not  allowed  to  come  into\r\n\r\nSingapore. Police and Immigration will be more vigilant  now  in\r\n\r\nmonitoring  all  our  border entry points.   The  monitoring  at\r\n\r\ncheckpoints at the Causeway, Tuas, land checkpoints, seaport and\r\n\r\nthe airport will all be stepped up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police and Immigration will also intensify the checks at\r\n\r\nthese checkpoints\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  detect the smuggling of illegal immigrants by vehicles.  Let\r\n\r\nme  give  Members an idea of what the numbers are of  those  who\r\n\r\nwere  so  detected.   In  1997, 26  illegal  immigrants  and  11\r\n\r\nsmugglers  were  arrested, and 13 vehicles seized  at  Tuas  and\r\n\r\nCauseway checkpoints.  Vessels carrying illegal immigrants  will\r\n\r\nbe  stopped by force, if necessary.  And iIf they try  to  evade\r\n\r\narrest despite being told to do so, then the Police Coast Guard,\r\n\r\nas  I  said, will use force to stop them.  If they are arrested,\r\n\r\nthese  vessels will be confiscated and they will be disposed  of\r\n\r\nor  destroyed.  In 1997, last year, 30 such vessels were  seized\r\n\r\ntogether with 255 illegal immigrants arrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tightening of Visa Control</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration also imposes visas to address the overstayer\r\n\r\nproblem  for some years, and visas have been imposed  on  people\r\n\r\ncoming from countries such as the People's Republic of China and\r\n\r\nIndia.   Last year, we also imposed visas on people coming  from\r\n\r\nMyanmar and Bangladesh.  We will consider imposing visas on\r\n\r\nother  nationalities if they pose a serious overstaying  problem\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the regional situation, it is in the interest of\r\n\r\nall Singaporeans that we continue with our very strict and tough\r\n\r\nstance  against immigration offenders.  The Police,  Immigration\r\n\r\nand  the  other agencies in the Home Team and indeed members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  can  also help us and we will spare  no  effort  to\r\n\r\ndetect and deal firmly with immigration offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team will closely monitor the situation, take the\r\n\r\nnecessary actions, adjust the strategies and deployment and stay\r\n\r\non  top  of the situation.  This will help to ensure the  safety\r\n\r\nand security of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the salary structure of the Police\r\n\r\nForce  was adjusted last year.

I am pleased to read  in\r\n\r\nthe  press  recently  that  the  prison's  recruitment  exercise\r\n\r\nattracted an unprecedented number of applicants.

Investing   in  high-technology   equipment   will\r\n\r\ncomplement and supplement the limitations of human resources, as\r\n\r\nthey  can  give  early warning and pinpoint the  locations  with\r\n\r\naccuracy.  With the economic crisis in the region, the waves  of\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants, as the Minister and other Members have said,\r\n\r\nwill foreseeably be more frequent and intense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that technology is also making great progress\r\n\r\nand  white-collar crimes have become increasingly  more  complex\r\n\r\nand  complicated.   There was a report recently  that  some  FBI\r\n\r\nagents  in the US are equipped with laptop or notebook computers\r\n\r\nto  help  them fight crimes, and they have achieved some measure\r\n\r\nof success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the investment in equipment and the changing climate\r\n\r\nof  crime  entails  that  the quality  of  our  law  enforcement\r\n\r\nofficers   must   continue  to  rise  to  match   the   changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   There  is  also a compelling  need  to  operate\r\n\r\nacross  departments  and  Ministries,  as  issues  become   more\r\n\r\ncomplex.   Joint operations require well thought out  plans  and\r\n\r\ncoordination to ensure a greater degree of success.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nit goes without saying that the quality of leadership is crucial\r\n\r\nin such operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be pleased to hear the Minister elaborate on some\r\n\r\nof  his  Ministry's  plans to improve the  quality  of  our  law\r\n\r\nenforcement officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chng, you can go on to your next topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, Singapore has been rated as one of\r\n\r\nthe safest cities in the world.  Singaporeans can take pride  in\r\n\r\nour  police  force for making this possible.  Recent reports  on\r\n\r\nthe crime statistics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshow that crime has been declining despite a number of cases  of\r\n\r\nserious crimes in the first two months of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the economic conditions appear to be less\r\n\r\nfavourable  this means it is bad news for crime.   The  reported\r\n\r\nrise  in  illegal  immigrants also  spells  bad  news.   Illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  without  gainful employment  are  good  targets  for\r\n\r\ncrime.  Since the beginning of this year, the spate of break-ins\r\n\r\nseems to be on the increase, as the press reports  go.  Most  of\r\n\r\nthem involve burglary in landed properties and in most of these,\r\n\r\nthe  burglars were armed.  This is most worrisome, as  it  shows\r\n\r\nthat  these armed burglars come prepared and their victims  were\r\n\r\nsubdued.   In other words, criminals are getting more desperate.\r\n\r\nOn 4th March 1998, three condominium units in Seletar Hills were\r\n\r\nburgled.  Even condominiums  which have some measure of security\r\n\r\nare not safe when it comes to crime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is every possibility of the crime situation getting\r\n\r\nworse  this year.  Besides increasing law enforcement  measures,\r\n\r\npublic  education must also be stepped up.  The recent spate  of\r\n\r\nburglaries  may be avoided if the owners had been more  vigilant\r\n\r\nand   if   security  systems  had  been  installed.    Educating\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and reminding them to improve on security  measures\r\n\r\nshould be an on-going effort, but they do have their limitations\r\n\r\nas it is human behaviour to think that bad things only happen to\r\n\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprehending criminals in housing estates is much more\r\n\r\ndifficult  because of the size and location of these  houses  in\r\n\r\nthe  estates.   Greater police presence  may  not  be  the  most\r\n\r\neffective way of preventing break-ins.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to elaborate on what steps\r\n\r\nhave  been taken to strengthen the existing measures and whether\r\n\r\nthe police could do more to contain this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, at a recent press\r\n\r\nconference,  the Criminal Investigation Department  assured  the\r\n\r\npublic that the number of murders, 15 in total, in the first two\r\n\r\nmonths of this year is not unusually high.  In fact, there were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  periods at the peak which exceeded the total of January and\r\n\r\nFebruary  this  year, ie,   between October and  November  1994,\r\n\r\nthere  were 15 murders, and between September and October  1993,\r\n\r\nthere were 16 cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of little comfort because in the past years, the\r\n\r\naverage yearly number of murders was 45 cases.  It works out  to\r\n\r\nbe  an  average of four murders a month.  During the  first  two\r\n\r\nmonths of this year, the total number well exceeded the average.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  this is seen together with last year's trend, it  shows\r\n\r\nthat, although the number of crimes committed is lower, what  is\r\n\r\nsignificant is that the reported cases for murder and rape cases\r\n\r\nincreased.  It is indeed an area for great concern as these  are\r\n\r\nthe  two most feared and serious types of crime.  The recent two\r\n\r\nbrutal double murders  really shocked all Singaporeans.  One  of\r\n\r\nthese  murders occurred in my constituency.  In fact, the  whole\r\n\r\nneighbourhood was really shaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the causes, it is not something that we should\r\n\r\nconsider  not  out of the ordinary, as has been  stated  by  the\r\n\r\nCriminal   Investigation  Department.   We   should   never   be\r\n\r\ncomplacent just because we have achieved a lower crime rate  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  is perceived to be a very safe place for us  to  live\r\n\r\nin.   While  I  compliment the police department  for  doing  an\r\n\r\nexcellent job in keeping the crime rate low, I would request the\r\n\r\ndepartment  to  put in greater efforts to address  our  concern,\r\n\r\nespecially in the case of murder and rape.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, first of all, I am very happy to note\r\n\r\nthat  the total expenditure for the Ministry of Home Affairs  in\r\n\r\nFY  97  increased over actual FY 96, and a further  increase  of\r\n\r\n$104 million has been budgetted for FY 98.  I fully support  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  build  up and maintain a credible and  effective  Home\r\n\r\nTeam.  The Home Team has done an admirable job in bringing  down\r\n\r\nthe  crime rate which has declined for the past nine years, with\r\n\r\nsome types of crimes registering record lows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans and foreigners alike appreciate our safe\r\n\r\nstreets.  This is an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant  element in making Singapore one of the  most  livable\r\n\r\ncities  in  the world and the best home for our people.   It  is\r\n\r\nalso  one  of  the  positive factors which top  foreign  talents\r\n\r\nconsider  when  deciding   to  relocate  themselves  and   their\r\n\r\nfamilies  to Singapore.  Therefore, in addition to our  emphasis\r\n\r\non   defence,   education  and  development  of   our   economic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,  I  would  strongly  support  our  emphasis   on\r\n\r\nmaintaining  and  enhancing public security in Singapore.   Just\r\n\r\nlike a credible defence force, an effective Home Team cannot  be\r\n\r\ncreated   and   developed  overnight.   It  requires   long-term\r\n\r\ncommitment  and  investment  in  manpower,  hardware,  software,\r\n\r\nexpertise and new technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our crime rates have dropped over the past nine\r\n\r\nyears, we must not be complacent.  Because, I believe, our  Home\r\n\r\nTeam will face particularly tough challenges in the face of  the\r\n\r\non-going regional economic crisis.  There is a real danger  that\r\n\r\ncrime  and  violence  may escalate under the  present  difficult\r\n\r\nregional  circumstances.  In addition to the problem of  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants which I have raised earlier, an increase in crime may\r\n\r\nbe due to one or more of the following reasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the impact of the crisis on our local population is\r\n\r\nprofound.  Singaporeans, especially the younger generation,  are\r\n\r\nused   to   enjoying  years  of  strong  economic   growth   and\r\n\r\nappreciating  asset values.  Generally, we have  benefited  from\r\n\r\nthe  good years and there is no denying that there is a  sizable\r\n\r\nproportion  of  Singaporeans who have grown  accustomed  to  the\r\n\r\ncreature  comforts of the good life, some even to the  point  of\r\n\r\nbeing extravagant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, they are now faced with a slowdown and the real\r\n\r\npossibility of a decrease in asset values, loss of  jobs  and  a\r\n\r\nreduction of income.  In the light of this slowdown, they should\r\n\r\nmake adjustments to their lifestyles and trim expenditure.   But\r\n\r\nsome  may  succumb to temptation or pure greed and some  may  be\r\n\r\nforced  by severe financial difficulties to take the easy  route\r\n\r\nto money through crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Singapore is a very open country. Last year, there\r\n\r\nwere  more  than  6 1/2 million tourist arrivals.  Many  will  come\r\n\r\ngenuinely  looking to enjoy our beautiful country,  seeking  job\r\n\r\nopportunities  or to trade.  But there will be  some  foreigners\r\n\r\nwho  come here with the intention to commit crime and those who,\r\n\r\nwhile they are here on a legitimate purpose, turn to crime  when\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  presents itself.  These  foreigners  take  the\r\n\r\nchance, secure in the knowledge that they are anonymous in  this\r\n\r\ncountry   and  can  flee  quickly  and  easily  without  notice.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  more  in the areas of crime prevention,  encouraging\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public to report and arrest criminals, and  fast\r\n\r\npolice response to the scene of crime must be done to arrest and\r\n\r\naddress this potential problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should not take our low crime rates for granted.\r\n\r\nThe police force and other Home Team agencies need resources  to\r\n\r\nconstantly  upgrade  their establishment, their  expertise,  and\r\n\r\noperational capabilities to prevent, deter and solve crimes.  We\r\n\r\nmust do our utmost to support the building and maintenance of an\r\n\r\neffective  Home Team so that our streets and homes  will  remain\r\n\r\nsafe in the midst of the on-going regional crisis and beyond.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, personal security, both in\r\n\r\nthe  home  and  outside, is a major concern for everyone.   Safe\r\n\r\nstreets, safer homes.  Singapore is fortunate.  We on the  whole\r\n\r\ndo  have safe streets and safer homes.  But recent robberies and\r\n\r\nmurders  highlighted by the press have led many with the feeling\r\n\r\nof  unease,  particularly in the housing estates  affected.   It\r\n\r\noften  translates into an emotive issue.   At grassroots  level,\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House would have inevitably been approached  by\r\n\r\nresidents  wishing to be assured of a higher level of  security.\r\n\r\nThat  is  understandable.  What is not  often  stressed  enough,\r\n\r\nhowever, is that the war against crime is not just fought by the\r\n\r\nHome  Team, the uniformed services.  It requires the support  of\r\n\r\nthe very people they are duty bound to protect.  The man-in-the-street must participate actively in crime prevention.  The  more\r\n\r\nthe public is aware of the need to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncooperate and be crime conscious the less crime there  will  be.\r\n\r\nPublic awareness has to be improved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Minister announced a new plan to restructure\r\n\r\nthe  coverage  of the Home Team in Singapore.   A pilot  project\r\n\r\nwas  started, I believe, and we are anxious to hear how the  new\r\n\r\nNPC/NPP  combination has worked out.  Is it likely that in  this\r\n\r\nyear  we  can expect the restructuring to go on?  If  so,  which\r\n\r\nareas would next benefit from the new methods of policing?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe too that there is a need, given the manpower\r\n\r\nshortage  in the services, to give more thought to  the  use  of\r\n\r\nelectronic surveillance equipment in Singapore.  It was found in\r\n\r\nstudies  abroad  that where there were surveillance  cameras  in\r\n\r\nplace  crime  has  fallen.  Cameras have often  helped  also  in\r\n\r\nidentifying culprits and the like.  I would urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  installing  such equipment,  not  just,  for  example,\r\n\r\ninside  MRT  stations, but also in the surrounding  areas  where\r\n\r\nthere  are usually pedestrians who may be walking home  late  at\r\n\r\nnight.   Indeed, it may be appropriate in due course  to  extend\r\n\r\nsuch camera surveillance to housing estates, especially in areas\r\n\r\nthat are isolated, such as in blocks bordering parks or roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the control of crime calls for collective action. The\r\n\r\nHome Team must help citizens protect themselves.  Crime can cast\r\n\r\na  dark  shadow over a large group of people, the  victims,  the\r\n\r\nrelatives,  the  bystanders,  the people  in  the  vicinity  and\r\n\r\nneighbours.   Singapore takes a very hard line, rightly  so,  in\r\n\r\ndealing  with  criminals, and for that we do have  a  very  safe\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, internal security is every bit as\r\n\r\nimportant  as our defence from external threats.  Total  defence\r\n\r\nshould cover the work of the Home Team as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, let me first deal with Mr Chng's\r\n\r\nquestion about the training of the Home Team officers on the use\r\n\r\nof  high-tech  equipment.  Let me assure him that  we  are  very\r\n\r\naware that we need to keep in touch with the changing times and,\r\n\r\nas   a  result,  the  Ministry  has  embarked  on  a  number  of\r\n\r\nacquisitions of high-tech equipment.  Therefore, we will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefinitely  pay  a  great  deal of  attention  in  training  our\r\n\r\nofficers  on the use of high-tech equipment.  Over the next  few\r\n\r\nyears,  in fact, the Home Team will take a quantum leap  in  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  information technology (IT) and other high-tech systems\r\n\r\nto  help the Home Team in its enforcement efforts.  I can assure\r\n\r\nMembers that the Home Team officers will be properly trained  in\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  these  equipment.  For  example,  all  our  police\r\n\r\nrecruits  are  now  trained in the use of  command  and  control\r\n\r\nmobile  data  terminals that are needed for front line  policing\r\n\r\nduring their basic training.  Recently, 550 immigration officers\r\n\r\nwere  also trained in the handling of sophisticated IT  systems,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  Tuas network infrastructure, the  entry  and  exit\r\n\r\ncontrol  upgraded  system, the immigration automated   clearance\r\n\r\nsystem  and  the automated character recognition system  at  the\r\n\r\nTuas  Checkpoint to facilitate Singaporeans and other  users  of\r\n\r\nthe checkpoint to clear the checkpoint as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Defence Force, for example, also uses training\r\n\r\nsimulators  to  train  its  staff our  people  on  fighting  LPG\r\n\r\nleakages  and  fires, flashovers and hazardous materials.   They\r\n\r\nuse these simulators to enhance training realism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another target for the Ministry is to make the use of\r\n\r\npersonal  computers more universal within the next two to  three\r\n\r\nyears.   This  we  do through the  intelligent  desktop\r\n\r\nproject  and it will help us to attain the goal of 100% computer\r\n\r\nliteracy  for  all our officers over the next few  years.   With\r\n\r\nall  these on-going measures, we will work together  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our  senior  and  junior  officers  are  trained,  quality\r\n\r\npersonnel  who  will be able to handle high-tech  equipment  and\r\n\r\nsystems well into the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chng's and Mr Kenneth Chen's concern about the crime\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Singapore, in particular Mr Chen's concern  about\r\n\r\nthe  CID's comments recently that the number of murder cases  is\r\n\r\nnot  unusual, let me first assure him that CID is not taking the\r\n\r\nmatter lightly, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  find the number acceptable.  But  what  they  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  put out is the fact that, \"yes, indeed,  we  have  a\r\n\r\nnumber of murders over the last two months.  Let us take this in\r\n\r\nproper  perspective and not be unduly alarmed by it, but at  the\r\n\r\nsame time not to be complacent about it\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CID actually compared the figures with previous years'\r\n\r\nfigures and found that the figures, are no doubt high.   But\r\n\r\nthey  are  not really unusual, and they have given some numbers.\r\n\r\nFor example, in 1993 and 1994, there were 15 and 16 murder cases\r\n\r\njust  over  two consecutive months.  Eventually,  we  found  the\r\n\r\ncause of those murder cases and since then we have no more  such\r\n\r\nproblems.  But I agree with Mr Chen that the past record of high\r\n\r\nmurder  rates  is not a good reason for us to feel   comfortable\r\n\r\nabout  the  situation.   For  the families  of  those  who  were\r\n\r\nmurdered,  our  sympathies and condolences  are  certainly  with\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these 13 cases in the first two months of this year\r\n\r\nwere  unrelated. We do not have a serial murderer on the  loose.\r\n\r\nThe  murders are not concentrated  on  any  particular\r\n\r\ngeographical area.  The victims come from different  backgrounds\r\n\r\nand  the reasons for their being murdered differed from  one  to\r\n\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen has expressed concern that the public sense of well-being and security may be affected because of the economic\r\n\r\ndownturn  and  more crimes like these murders may be  committed.\r\n\r\nHe  wanted to know how many of these were due to  economic\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CID has assessed that none of the 13 murders in January and\r\n\r\nFebruary were the result of the economic downturn.  In three out\r\n\r\nof the 13 cases, the perpetrators actually killed the victims in\r\n\r\norder  to facilitate robbery, and the reasons for robbery  could\r\n\r\nbe  many.   The rest were either crimes of passion  or  isolated\r\n\r\ncases  of  fights and disputes.  If these people could  not\r\n\r\nsettle the disputes, force was used and as a result people  die.\r\n\r\nIn  1996,  seven of the 31 cases of murder involved robbery,  as\r\n\r\ndid eight out of the 37 in 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the police doing about the increase, and whether\r\n\r\nthe number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmurders  will  be further increased this year, as  Mr  Chng  has\r\n\r\nasked.   The  year has not run out yet.  I hope the number  will\r\n\r\nnot  be large and it is still too soon to tell.  But we know  in\r\n\r\n1997,  there were 37 murder cases compared to 31 in  1996.   But\r\n\r\nthese  were  actually  quite low figures  compared  to  previous\r\n\r\nyears, for example, between 1990 and 1995, we had between 42 and\r\n\r\n58 murder cases.  The number fluctuates from year to year.  Five\r\n\r\nof the 13 cases committed this year have already been solved and\r\n\r\nCID told me that they were making good progress in the remaining\r\n\r\ncases and they are confident of solving more of them soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng is also concerned about the recent spate of reports\r\n\r\nof  robberies  or  house-breaking incidents in  private  housing\r\n\r\nestates.   Yes,  indeed,  there are some  reports  about  house-breaking.   Whether we have more of such cases,  again  in\r\n\r\n1998, I would say that it is too soon to tell.  But in 1997,  we\r\n\r\nhad 42 such cases of private estate house robberies compared  to\r\n\r\nonly  17  in  1996.  So we can see that there is an increase  in\r\n\r\nhouse-robbery cases between 1996 and 1997.  Again, there  is  no\r\n\r\nparticular reason to explain this increase and neither is  there\r\n\r\na sign that the trend will continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng has asked what steps police will be taking to deal\r\n\r\nwith the problem.  The police told me that:  Firstly,  they have\r\n\r\nset  up  a  Fast  Response  Task Force  to  respond  quickly  to\r\n\r\napprehend  the  suspects when the cases occur.  But  again  that\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the residents and the people who were  affected  to\r\n\r\nreport the commission of crime as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they have deployed temporary police posts to\r\n\r\nareas which are affected by the robberies in order to project  a\r\n\r\nhigher police profile and visibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, they have intensified the crime prevention\r\n\r\nactivities with the residents; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, they have helped the residents form\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood Watch zones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some Members have said, I would like to stress also\r\n\r\nthat crime prevention is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  the  sole responsibility of the police.  All of us  play  a\r\n\r\npart.   We  must do our share and we must help to keep crime  at\r\n\r\nbay.  Although the crime rate has been declining every year  for\r\n\r\nthe  last  nine years, we must not be complacent and think  that\r\n\r\nwethey will not be a target for criminals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are indeed many measures which residents, the home\r\n\r\nowners  themselves, whether they live in a HDB estate  or  in  a\r\n\r\nprivate  condominium or landed property, can take  in  order  to\r\n\r\nmake  the homes more secure.  For example, they can install good\r\n\r\nquality  locks  or alarm systems.  And iIf they  have  an  alarm\r\n\r\nsystem,  for goodness sake, please switch them on when they  are\r\n\r\nneeded.   I  know  quite a number of these  private  residential\r\n\r\nproperties have alarm systems, but, unfortunately, they were not\r\n\r\nturned  on  when  the criminals and the robbers  went  into  the\r\n\r\nhouse.   Even when they leave their homes, residentsthey  should\r\n\r\ntake  the  necessary precaution of securing the home by  closing\r\n\r\nthe  windows and doors, shutting the grilles and so on, and  not\r\n\r\nlike in one instance, where I read in the papers, they just left\r\n\r\nthings  as  they were and walked out of the home, thinking  that\r\n\r\neverything  would be fine.  The worst thing you  can  do  is  to\r\n\r\ntempt  the  robber or any perpetrator who may want to  commit  a\r\n\r\ncrime, passing by your home and finding it is so unprotected and\r\n\r\ngiving  him an opportunity to commit a crime.  Those  living  in\r\n\r\nprivate  condominiums or even in landed properties can  help  to\r\n\r\nform  Neighbourhood Watch Groups.  In fact, I think it  is  good\r\n\r\nfor  them  if they can form Neighbourhood Watch Groups not  just\r\n\r\nfor  protection of their own homes, but also for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  neighbourliness.  At, at least  theyyou  get  to  know\r\n\r\ntheiryour  neighbours.   And Iif they see suspicious  characters\r\n\r\nlurking around, I think they should report them to the Police as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible, and the Police will respond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police, in fact, is going around helping to form\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  Watch Groups.  In the past few  years,  they  had\r\n\r\nformed  8,000  such  groups  in  the  private  housing  estates,\r\n\r\nincluding  condominiums.  And I would urge all those  living  in\r\n\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestates, condominiums, landed property, to form NWGs as  quickly\r\n\r\nas  possible.  The Police will help them if they are asked.  The\r\n\r\nPolice   will   also  work  very  closely  with  the   Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment Councils and other grassroots organisations to  come\r\n\r\nup  with measures to see how we can make the place where we live\r\n\r\nmore  safe  and  more secure, and they will jointly  come  upout\r\n\r\ntogether  with a Community Focused Plan, which I will  elaborate\r\n\r\nlater on, on how to get the community more actively involved  in\r\n\r\ncrime  prevention.   So  actually it  is  a  very  simple,  very\r\n\r\ncommonsensical  thing to do.  Everybody should take  extra  care\r\n\r\nand  precaution, and play histheir part to help keep crime rates\r\n\r\nlow  and  not  be complacent, especially during this  period  of\r\n\r\neconomic uncertainty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min has made many complimentary remarks on the\r\n\r\nHome  Team  officers.  I am sure they are very pleased  to  hear\r\n\r\nthat.   And  I want to thank him for his support.  I agree  with\r\n\r\nhim  fully that home security and safety is as important as  our\r\n\r\nexternal  defence.  Because if our home is not safe,  people  do\r\n\r\nnot  feel  safe walking the streets and do not feel  safe  going\r\n\r\nout,  I  think  we willare be just prisoners in our  own  homes,\r\n\r\nwhich  the  residents of some countries experience.  ThenAnd   I\r\n\r\nthink  no investors would want to come here.  One of the reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  many investors want to come to Singapore is that they  feel\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore is indeed very safe, where they  can  work,  and\r\n\r\nbring up their children too.    And I can assure Mr Ong that the\r\n\r\nHome  Team  will  continue to remain very vigilant  in  fighting\r\n\r\ncrime and safeguarding our national security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked what has happened to the Neighbourhood\r\n\r\nPolice Centres which we announced last year and what actions  we\r\n\r\nare  going  to take in the next couple of years, and whether  we\r\n\r\ncould use more electronic surveillance equipment.  Let me report\r\n\r\nto  the  House that the pilot phase of the Neighbourhood  Police\r\n\r\nCentre (NPC) scheme, which was launched on 1st October last year\r\n\r\nin  Queenstown, indeed, has progressed very well.  The residents\r\n\r\nin Queenstown are quite happy with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresults  so  far.  The Queenstown NPC is doing well in  ensuring\r\n\r\nthe  safety  and security of the neighbourhood.  Now  Queenstown\r\n\r\nNPC  is  a  one-stop  centre providing a wide  range  of  police\r\n\r\nservices.   Response  time has also improved.   There  are  more\r\n\r\nfrequent patrols, and crime reports receive immediate and better\r\n\r\non-scene investigations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some NPPs are now closed after 11.00 pm, because\r\n\r\nthere  was  not  much demand and the place was rather  quiet  in\r\n\r\nthose  NPPs, the presence of police officers on the  ground  has\r\n\r\nactually  not reduced.  In fact, the presence of police officers\r\n\r\nhas  actually  been increased on the ground.   Patrol  man-hours\r\n\r\nhave  increased by 13%, for instance.  The number of  quick\r\n\r\nresponse teams has also increased from five to seven during  the\r\n\r\npeak hours between 6.00 pm and 1.00 am.  And anyone who comes to\r\n\r\nthe NPP, which is closed after 11.00 pm, can have quick and easy\r\n\r\naccess  to the Police through the Emergency Communication System\r\n\r\ninstalled at the particular NPP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Queenstown NPC was set up, crime victims in that\r\n\r\narea  are  now  better and faster served.   Instead  of  passing\r\n\r\nthrough  a chain of investigators, from NPC officers, divisional\r\n\r\nofficers,  and so on, now the crime victim is served immediately\r\n\r\nby  the NPC officer who is a front-line officer dealing with the\r\n\r\nentire on-scene investigation process.  As the NPC officers  are\r\n\r\nbetter   trained  and  now  have  greater  authority  in   crime\r\n\r\ninvestigation, they can also process the case much faster.   For\r\n\r\nexample, now most of the on-scene investigations attended to  by\r\n\r\nthe NPC officers are processed within 40 to 45 minutes, compared\r\n\r\nto about double the time previously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NPC has also enabled the Police to forge a stronger\r\n\r\ncommunity  participation, a partnership  in  the  fight  against\r\n\r\ncrime.   For example, the NPC has joined hands with the  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar-West  Coast  Community  Development  Council  to  organise\r\n\r\nwholesome activities for youths who are at high risk of becoming\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquents.  The second storey of the  Alexandra  NPP\r\n\r\nwill  be  converted  into  a centre for counselling  of  wayward\r\n\r\nyouths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  December  last  year, the Queenstown NPC and  the  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee jointly organised a Queenstown Family Day\r\n\r\nwith  the  twin objectives of increasing social interaction  and\r\n\r\nraising crime prevention awareness amongst the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these service improvements are quite apparent and clear\r\n\r\nto  the residents.  A telephone service audit, conducted by  the\r\n\r\nQuality  Service  Unit  of  Clementi  Police  Station  recently,\r\n\r\nrevealed  that the residents served by the NPC were  very  happy\r\n\r\nwith the services received.  There were no adverse comments from\r\n\r\nthe  respondents.  And crime victims who were served by the  NPC\r\n\r\nofficers responded that the standard of investigation was good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin was asking whether, with the cut in the budget,\r\n\r\nour  NPC roll-out plan would be affected or not, and what  would\r\n\r\nbe the roll-out plan for the next few NPCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that the Clementi Police Division will have its\r\n\r\nfull complement of NPCs, with the addition of three new ones  in\r\n\r\nJurong East, Clementi and Bukit Merah by April 1998.  But due to\r\n\r\nthe tighter budget situation, the roll-out of other NPCs will be\r\n\r\nstaggered  over  a slightly longer period of time,  compared  to\r\n\r\nwhat was originally planned.  The entire NPC programme will  now\r\n\r\nbe completed by June 2001, instead of July 2000.  So it is about\r\n\r\n11   months  of  delay.   This  slight  delay  in  the  physical\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  will  not mean a delay in the  transfer  of  the\r\n\r\nexperience  and knowledge gained from operating the NPC  scheme.\r\n\r\nThe  Police  will  proceed to transfer the  lessons  learnt  and\r\n\r\nexperiences gathered from the operational NPCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Police Force has been successful in keeping crime\r\n\r\nrates  down for nine years.  Crime rate has become  quite\r\n\r\nlow and the people feel quite safe now to walk the streets.  The  Police  will continue to keep the vigilance.  But,  again,\r\n\r\nlet  me  say  this: that the community has a  part  to  play  in\r\n\r\nkeeping  its own living environment safe and  secure.   The\r\n\r\ncommunity cannot depend solely on the Police for its safety\r\n\r\nand security.  People can take a proactive stance by forming\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood Watch Groups or Zones, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major initiative that we are now actively responding to\r\n\r\nis  to  strike a stronger partnership between the CDCs  and  the\r\n\r\nHome  Team.   Safety  and  security are  at  the  heart  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity's well-being and an integral element in the  self-help\r\n\r\nbuilding process.  As such, I believe the Home Team can help the\r\n\r\nCDCs  achieve their aim of greater community ownership of  civil\r\n\r\naffairs, especially in safety and security issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team plans to help each CDC develop a Community\r\n\r\nFocused  Plan  (CFP)  to  involve the community  in  safety  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  issues.   The  CFP  is  basically  a  plan  for  joint\r\n\r\nproactive  community and Home Team initiatives,  programmes  and\r\n\r\nprojects,  which  are tailored to meet the safety  and  security\r\n\r\nneeds of that particular community.  The CFP will provide a more\r\n\r\nstructured, focused and coordinated approach for the  Home  Team\r\n\r\nto   help  CDCs  engage  and  mobilize  the  community  to  take\r\n\r\nresponsibility for their own needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with, the CFP will focus on police issues.\r\n\r\nActivities  that will form part of the CFP, for  example,  could\r\n\r\ninclude  crime prevention, road safety, community-based  problem\r\n\r\nsolving  and  victim support.  After about six months  into  the\r\n\r\nCFP, the activities could be extended to include other Home Team\r\n\r\nissues   such  as  fire  prevention,  civil  defence  education,\r\n\r\nemergency  drills,  preventive  drug  education,  care  for  the\r\n\r\nfamilies of those who are incarcerated and helping those who are\r\n\r\nreleased from prisons to reintegrate into our community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the CDCs, the Chairmen and Mayors, that the\r\n\r\nHome  Team will spare no efforts to help make this joint venture\r\n\r\na success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is also concerned about new towns and whether\r\n\r\nthe Police will take an interest in the new towns or not.  I can\r\n\r\nassure  Prof.  Chin that Police take an interest  in  all  areas\r\n\r\nwhich  are  prone to crime.  If there is a serious problem,  the\r\n\r\nPolice  will  attend to it.  If not, Police  resources  will  be\r\n\r\ndiverted  to  places where it is most needed.  In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nSembawang,  particularly in the place where  Prof.  Chin  is  in\r\n\r\ncharge of, from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndata  I  know,  I  think it is a very safe place.   Compared  to\r\n\r\nnational  statistics, I think that area where Prof. Chin  is  in\r\n\r\ncharge of has one of the lowest crime rates in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, early this month,\r\n\r\nthe  Police  reported  that juvenile  crimes  showed  a  smaller\r\n\r\nincrease  of  1.8% to 2,147 youngsters arrested  in  1997.   The\r\n\r\nmoderation  is due mainly to a drop in the number  arrested  for\r\n\r\nfights  in public and the Police noted that the banning  of  tea\r\n\r\ndances  may  well  have well checked such  incidence.   What  is\r\n\r\ndisturbing is the rise in stealing offences by youths,  as  such\r\n\r\nacts are probably a manifestation of an underlying problem  -  a\r\n\r\nlack  of  self-esteem and the need to seek attention.   What  is\r\n\r\nequally disturbing from a separate analysis of trends in  recent\r\n\r\nyears is the increase in more violent crimes and a higher female\r\n\r\nparticipation rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the small increase in overall youth crime of 1.8% in\r\n\r\n1997  is  not  cause  for  celebration as  juvenile  delinquency\r\n\r\nremains a social problem, one that concerns parents, schools and\r\n\r\nsociety at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a multi-organisation approach, involving the\r\n\r\nPolice,  MCD, schools, home and the community, is  in  place  to\r\n\r\ntackle  juvenile  delinquency, both in terms of  corrective  and\r\n\r\npreventive  measures.   However, to avoid overlapping  and  poor\r\n\r\nmonitoring,  especially of recalcitrants who might slip  through\r\n\r\nthe  cracks,  either a single agency should  be  set  up  or  an\r\n\r\nexisting  agency  be made responsible for the  coordination  and\r\n\r\nfollow-through of all efforts, in an exhaustive manner, to  help\r\n\r\ndelinquents and even teens-at-risk.  This agency should  ideally\r\n\r\nfacilitate  an  exchange of information  between  the  different\r\n\r\nimplementing bodies, perhaps through the creation of  a  central\r\n\r\ndatabase.   The  focus should be on youths as  individuals,  and\r\n\r\nthis agency should ensure that all efforts are made to help them\r\n\r\nrehabilitate.  Would the Minister consider putting in place such\r\n\r\nan arrangement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, early last year, the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  juvenile  delinquency had often  been  highlighted.\r\n\r\nConcern  for  the  deteriorating situation  had  caused  several\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  be  introduced, one of which was  the  banning  of\r\n\r\nteenagers  under  the  age  of 16  to  attend  any  tea  dances.\r\n\r\nAssistance  also  is  sought  from grassroots  organisations  to\r\n\r\norganise  more  activities  for  youths  to  keep  them  out  of\r\n\r\nproblems.  Teacher-cop was also introduced to the schools  which\r\n\r\nI  understand has worked very effectively.  Since then, not much\r\n\r\nhas  been  reported  on the activities of juvenile  delinquency.\r\n\r\nBut  of  late, again, there have been some cases of gang  fights\r\n\r\nbeing  brought to our notice.  Only a few days ago,  a  teenager\r\n\r\nwas  brutally attacked by a group of youths.  So it appears that\r\n\r\nall  is not well with our youths.  I would therefore like to ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister to give us an update on the situation and inform us\r\n\r\nwhether  more  measures  would  be  introduced  to  address  the\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Choo.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> I am not speaking.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Ho.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I thank both Members for speaking on juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency.  Let me first respond to Mr Chen who has asked  the\r\n\r\nHouse for an update on the juvenile delinquency situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the number of juvenile offenders arrested rose\r\n\r\nsteadily  from  1,205 in 1990 to 2,574 in 1995.  We  managed  to\r\n\r\nreduce the number to 2,110 in 1996.  Last year, it rose slightly\r\n\r\nby 37 to 2,147.  Sir, the increase was due to a higher number of\r\n\r\nunlawful assembly cases as well as property-related cases,  such\r\n\r\nas   shoplifting  and  robbery.   There  were,   however,   some\r\n\r\nencouraging signs.  For example, the number of juvenile  student\r\n\r\noffenders  fell slightly from 1,782 in 1996 to 1,749 last  year.\r\n\r\nThe number of juveniles arrested for rioting, an area of concern\r\n\r\nwhich we focused on last year, fell by 30%, from 216\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  1996  to 154 last year.  Nevertheless, I agree with Mr  Chen\r\n\r\nthat  the  situation  still  has to be  very  closely  monitored\r\n\r\nbecause the numbers are still unacceptably high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as alluded to by both speakers, in particular, Mrs\r\n\r\nLim,  juvenile  delinquency is indeed a  complex,  multi-faceted\r\n\r\nproblem.  And the number of arrests alone may not tell the  full\r\n\r\nstory.   The  reasons why a juvenile turns to crime are  diverse\r\n\r\nand complex in nature.  These may include ineffective parenting,\r\n\r\nparental  neglect,  boredom, undesirable peer influence,  greed,\r\n\r\nthe  desire to do the unconventional, or a combination of  these\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with the problem effectively requires the\r\n\r\ncoordinated efforts of various Ministries and agencies, such  as\r\n\r\nMCD,  MOE,  the  Police, the National Youth Council  (NYC),  the\r\n\r\ncourts  and voluntary welfare organisations.  Each must  do  its\r\n\r\npart, maximising its own expertise and tapping resources in  its\r\n\r\nrespective fields.  But Mrs Lim's suggestion for a single agency\r\n\r\nto be set up to deal with juvenile delinquency is one way to go,\r\n\r\nbut will not be the most effective one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our view, a better approach, one that we have\r\n\r\ntaken,  is  for the various Ministries and agencies to  continue\r\n\r\ndoing what they are best at, and for a single body to steer  and\r\n\r\ncoordinate  their  efforts  so as to avoid  duplication  and  to\r\n\r\nderive  the  greatest synergy.  The Inter-Ministry Committee  on\r\n\r\nJuvenile  Delinquecy (IMJD), which I chair, was set up in  April\r\n\r\n1996  with  this objective in mind.  It has MPs and social  work\r\n\r\nprofessionals on board with representation from MHA,  MCD,  MOE,\r\n\r\nAG's  Chambers, the Juvenile Court, NYC and the National Council\r\n\r\nof Social Services.  NYC provides the secretarial support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I informed the House in July last year, during the\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  Supply debate, IMJD's approach is to,  first  and\r\n\r\nforemost,   prevent  youths  from  drifting  into   delinquency;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  take  strict  enforcement action  against  those  who\r\n\r\ncreate   law   and   order   problems;  and   finally,   provide\r\n\r\nrehabilitation opportunities for those who are amenable to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchange.   MOE  leads in preventive education,  Police  leads  in\r\n\r\nenforcement  efforts,  and MCD leads in  the  rehabilitation  of\r\n\r\njuvenile offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMJD acts as a catalyst for multi-agency initiatives.\r\n\r\nIt  provides a platform for the agencies to exchange experiences\r\n\r\nand  share knowledge.  The Committee also identifies gaps in our\r\n\r\nmatrix  of  measures and makes recommendations as to  how  these\r\n\r\ngaps  may be filled, all of which functions Mrs Lim has  rightly\r\n\r\npointed  out are very important.  Since its formation  in  1996,\r\n\r\nthe  Committee has coordinated about 20 measures on  prevention,\r\n\r\nenforcement and rehabilitation which were mounted by the various\r\n\r\nMinistries and agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you one example. One example is the StreetWise\r\n\r\nProgramme  that was implemented in October last year.   This  6-month  programme aims at imbuing life skills in youths who  have\r\n\r\ndrifted  into  gang activities through close supervision,  night\r\n\r\ncurfew,  counselling, and other developmental training.   To  do\r\n\r\nthis,  IMJD  has pooled together resources of the  Police,  MCD,\r\n\r\nNYC,  VWOs  and the courts.  Another example which Mr  Chen  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  is  the Honorary VSC - teacher officer scheme   where\r\n\r\nIMJD acted as a catalyst to synergise Police and the schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This multi-pronged approach is an effective one, one that\r\n\r\nhas produced some results but, like I said,  we have to continue\r\n\r\nto  work at it.  However, Wwhilst juvenile delinquency is  under\r\n\r\ncontrol,  we cannot be satisfied with the results  so  far.   As\r\n\r\nmentioned  by both Mrs Lim and Mr Chen, all involved,  including\r\n\r\nnot  just  Governmental agencies, but and  many  people,  indeed\r\n\r\nparents  and the community in general, must press on by  working\r\n\r\ntogether  to  reduce  the numbers.  Hence, in  July  last  year,\r\n\r\nPolice  took  several new measures - - it appointed  11  teacher\r\n\r\nofficers as Honorary-VSC Senior Officers, itthey set up a Police\r\n\r\nCaution Cases Guidance Programme, together with MCD, and stepped\r\n\r\nup  preventive education.  Other partners in the IMJD have  also\r\n\r\nlaunched new initiatives, such as peer mediation by the  courts,\r\n\r\nCommunity Service Orders by MCD, promotion of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentoring   schemes  by  NYC  and  issuance  of  guidelines   on\r\n\r\ndiscipline by MOE.  These are just some examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen asked what else will be done. This year, we will\r\n\r\nassess  these  measures to see how their  effectiveness  can  be\r\n\r\nfurther  enhanced.  Also, IMJD will consider new measures.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  IMJD will discuss with Community Development  Councils\r\n\r\nand  see  how  they can help to reach out to youths,  especially\r\n\r\nthose   who  are  out  of  school.   Other  areas  where   CDCs'\r\n\r\ninvolvement  can  be explored are in enlisting more  volunteers,\r\n\r\nforming  mentor groups and helping parents and youths understand\r\n\r\neach  other  better.  At the rehabilitation  end,  Prisons  will\r\n\r\nstrengthen  its  reformative training Pprogramme.   Likewise,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that MCD will strengthen its Boys' Home Pprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mrs Lim suggested setting up a single agency to trackp\r\n\r\ndelinquents so that problematic juveniles can be identified  for\r\n\r\nearly monitoring and assistance.  She suggested something like a\r\n\r\ncentral database.  I am happy to inform Mrs Lim Hwee Hua that an\r\n\r\nInter-Agency Work Group chaired by MCD, with representation from\r\n\r\nMHA,  MCD, MOE, MOH, the Subordinate Courts and NCSS,  has  been\r\n\r\nset  up  to  develop  a  centralised  inter-agency  database  on\r\n\r\njuvenile  pre-delinquents  and delinquents.   The  participating\r\n\r\nagencies  will transfer information on cases to the  centralised\r\n\r\ndatabase,  which  they can then tap on an on-line  basis.   This\r\n\r\nwill  facilitate  the sharing of records for  investigation  and\r\n\r\nmonitoring purposes, so that the necessary pre-emptive steps can\r\n\r\nbe taken to help delinquents who need assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mrs Lim in her speech also mentioned her concern about\r\n\r\nfemale juvenile delinquency.  First, the numbers.  The number of\r\n\r\nfemale  juvenile offenders arrested actually fell  from  737  in\r\n\r\n1995  to  611  in  1996 and 582 in 1997.   More  than  80%  were\r\n\r\narrested for theft and related crimes, such as shoplifting.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  female juveniles arrested for rioting in  1997  also\r\n\r\ndecreased by 50% from 76 in 1996 to 38.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even with 1997's reduced figures, the numbers\r\n\r\narrested  are still double the 267 female juveniles arrested  in\r\n\r\n1991.  Therefore, rightly, we are concerned.  The efforts of the\r\n\r\nIMJD agencies may therefore have arrested the sharp rise in  the\r\n\r\nearly  1990s,  but  we  must never assume that  the  decline  of\r\n\r\narrests   over   the  last  two  years  will   continue.    More\r\n\r\nimportantly, the raw number of arrests may not fully reflect the\r\n\r\npeculiar  charactistics  of  female  juvenile  delinquency,   or\r\n\r\nindeed, its extent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMJD's comprehensive package of measures covers both female\r\n\r\nand  male  juveniles.   What  we will  do  in  order  to  better\r\n\r\nunderstand the profile of juveniles who riot, their backgrounds,\r\n\r\ntheir motivation, their reasons, and so forth, is that IMJD  has\r\n\r\ncommissioned a study on juvenile fighting and rioting.  We  want\r\n\r\nto  examine  actual cases to look into the backgrounds,  like  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  and the reasons for rioting and also whether or not  they\r\n\r\nare  aware  of the possible consequences of their actions.   The\r\n\r\nstudy  will  be  completed by year-end and will  provide  useful\r\n\r\ninputs  to agencies such as MCD, Police and NYC.  One  focus  of\r\n\r\nthis  study  will  be  on  female delinquents.   Female  teenage\r\n\r\ndelinquents may have problems peculiar to them as a  group,  and\r\n\r\nthe study will bear this in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, the recent drug bust\r\n\r\nresulting in the arrest of seven drug traffickers is certainly a\r\n\r\nfeather in the cap for the narcotic officers.  In fact, a number\r\n\r\nof  successful cases in recent months have been highlighted with\r\n\r\nlarge    amounts   of   prohibited   drugs   being    recovered.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  this success story brings with it  more  worries\r\n\r\nthan comfort.  Because, if there is still such a great need  for\r\n\r\nthe supply of these drugs, then one can conclude that there must\r\n\r\nbe equally greater demand.  Therefore, I would like to know from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  why, despite our all-out efforts to  combat  this\r\n\r\nsocial  menace  and  the heavy punishments  we  impose  on  drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers,  there  are still so many drug  trafficking  cases.\r\n\r\nWould  the  Minister enlighten us on the latest  number  of  new\r\n\r\ncases of drug addicts?  Are they on the increase?  And\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  about  the repeated cases?  If so, does it mean  that  our\r\n\r\nrehabilitation   programme  is  not   effective   as   we   have\r\n\r\nanticipated?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the repeated drug addicts are subject to\r\n\r\ncaning.  How effective has this form of punishment proved to be?\r\n\r\nI also understand that these drug addicts are being treated with\r\n\r\na  drug called Naltrexone.  Since this is a very expensive drug,\r\n\r\nhas  it  been found to be cost effective and how is the recovery\r\n\r\nrate after they have taken this drug?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, last year, I raised in the Committee\r\n\r\nof Supply debate the issue of privatisation of non-essential law\r\n\r\nenforcement  services.  Sir, the Police  Force,  or  Home  Team,\r\n\r\ndespite  the new salary structure will continue to face manpower\r\n\r\nshortage.   A  police  officer is a highly skilled  and  trained\r\n\r\nperson.   He needs to understand the law, how to apply the  law,\r\n\r\ntrained  as a diplomat as he is in contact with the public  and,\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time, he must be physically trained to  apprehend\r\n\r\nwrong-doers  or  perpetrators.  Hence,  the  non-essential  jobs\r\n\r\noutside the scope of the work of a police officer should be done\r\n\r\nby  another  agency or perhaps be privatised, for  example,  the\r\n\r\nrole   of  the  Traffic  Police  officer  in  issuing  car  park\r\n\r\nviolations.   This is not a Police function.  Will the  Minister\r\n\r\nhighlight  to  the  House the progress  made  in  this  area  of\r\n\r\nprivatisation of services?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yuing:</b> Sir, our Traffic Police is a\r\n\r\nfamiliar  and frequent sight on our roads and expressways.   The\r\n\r\nofficers maintain road discipline but other Members of the House\r\n\r\nhave  indicated or will indicate there is some concern over  the\r\n\r\nrising  number  of  accidents and other  moving  offences.   The\r\n\r\ninstallation  of  red light cameras and speed cameras  no  doubt\r\n\r\nhelp  in  general traffic control.  But we do seem to need  more\r\n\r\nofficers on highways to ensure a greater degree of compliance to\r\n\r\ntraffic  laws.   Indeed, the existence of two types  of  traffic\r\n\r\nofficers  may  give rise to some confusion.  For example,  those\r\n\r\nofficers  under the LTA are concerned principally with  offences\r\n\r\nrelating  to  overloading  of  trucks,  emission  violations  or\r\n\r\nunlawful modifications to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvehicles  and motorcycles.  They do not seem terribly interested\r\n\r\nin speeding cars or trucks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police, on the other hand, are responsible for\r\n\r\nthe  general conduct of drivers on the roads.  I wonder  whether\r\n\r\nit   is  not  time  to  consider  merging  these  officers,  not\r\n\r\nphysically but as a group, into a single body of men  and  women\r\n\r\ncharged  with  the  duties of enforcing  all  laws  relating  to\r\n\r\nvehicular traffic and rules of the road.  Such officers could be\r\n\r\ntrained specifically for the control of traffic and vehicles and\r\n\r\nfor  the investigation of road accidents, which is really  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  investigating  other  crimes.   Unless  someone\r\n\r\ndeliberately  runs  another down with an ulterior  motive,  road\r\n\r\naccidents  are  usually  the result of  carelessness  more  than\r\n\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings to mind the training of the officers\r\n\r\nthemselves.  It seems unnecessary to train traffic officers  for\r\n\r\nthe  general  investigation  of  crime.   If  the  officers  are\r\n\r\nrecruited specifically for traffic control, their training  can,\r\n\r\nin  fact, be faster and they can be put on the roads quicker  to\r\n\r\nassume   duties.   The  training   can  also  be  more  focused.\r\n\r\nCriteria for recruitment may also change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What all this leads to, if I may venture to suggest, is\r\n\r\nthat  it seems to be appropriate for the Traffic Police to  come\r\n\r\nperhaps  under the Land Transport Authority, although I wish  to\r\n\r\nassure  the Minister that far from it for me to suggest that  he\r\n\r\nrelinquishes  part of his authority.  It is a suggestion that it\r\n\r\nmay  be  better  for the Traffic Police to come under  the  Land\r\n\r\nTransport Authority, which already handles many duties  relating\r\n\r\nto the road system in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I am sure that Members in the House will\r\n\r\nwant  to  know whether there are steps taken to rationalise  the\r\n\r\nregulatory agencies with regard to land transport in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, with all the traffic\r\n\r\nmeasures  such  as  the introduction of speed traps,  red  light\r\n\r\ncameras, speed cameras, demerit points and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextremely heavy fines imposed on traffic offenders and the LTA's\r\n\r\nconstant efforts to improve our road design and conditions,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of   traffic  accidents still remains  high,  especially\r\n\r\nfatal  accidents.  I would like to ask the Minister whether  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police  could make a study on the main  causes  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious accidents that occur.  Is it due to speeding or reckless\r\n\r\ndriving?   Or  is it due to the lack of skill and experience  of\r\n\r\nthe drivers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there is a high percentage of\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists involved in traffic accidents.  At times, I marvel\r\n\r\nat  the  dare-devil  way motorcyclists weave their  way  through\r\n\r\nmotorcars  at high speed on expressways.  I wonder whether  they\r\n\r\nrealise  how  close they are from encountering  fatal  accidents\r\n\r\nevery  time they do so.  I would like to ask whether the Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  would consider lowering the speed limit for  provisional\r\n\r\ndrivers  and  motorcyclists if they  are  found  to  be  usually\r\n\r\ninvolved in the many traffic accidents.  I hope that the Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice Department can take the necessary measures to monitor the\r\n\r\nsituation  so  that our roads can be made safer and  unnecessary\r\n\r\nloss of lives can be kept to the minimum.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, first, let me deal with Mr Kenneth\r\n\r\nChen's  comments about the drug situation and whether all  these\r\n\r\nsuccess  stories  in  the raids mean more worries  because  more\r\n\r\npeople are still out there waiting to be caught.  He heard  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  still  more traffickers,  because  more  people  are\r\n\r\ndemanding drugs and therefore the situation has not got better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure him that CNB is also equally concerned about\r\n\r\nthe drug situation, and that is why it hasthey have gone all out\r\n\r\nto  take  enforcement actions against people who perpetrate  the\r\n\r\nuse of drugs, traffic in drugs or take drugs.  But let me assure\r\n\r\nhim  that the drug situation in Singapore is under control.   We\r\n\r\ndo  not  have as  serious a problem as in many other  countries.\r\n\r\nJust  for  his information, the number of drug addicts  arrested\r\n\r\nhas  actually fallen from 6,160 in 1994 to 4,750 in  1997.   The\r\n\r\nrelapse rate of drug addicts has also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimproved.  The relapse rate means that people who took drugs and\r\n\r\nafter  a  period,  they  went back  to  drugs.   This  has  also\r\n\r\nimproved.  It has declined steadily from 81% in 1994 to  56%  in\r\n\r\n1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one indicator whether we are getting more drug addicts\r\n\r\nor  not  is  the  arrest of the number of  arrest  of  new  drug\r\n\r\naddicts,  ie, people who are arrested for the first  time.   The\r\n\r\nnumber  of new drug addicts arrested  also registered a decline.\r\n\r\nCompared  to 1996 when we arrested 1,420 new drug addicts,  last\r\n\r\nyear, only 1,130 new addicts were arrested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other indicators such as the continued high price and low\r\n\r\npurity level of heroin also  confirm that the drug situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  actually  improved.   The  heroin  purity  level\r\n\r\ndropped to an all-time low of about 3-4% in 1997, compared to 7%\r\n\r\nin  1996.   What this means, according to CNB, is that the  drug\r\n\r\nsuppliers,  people who supply drugs to the addicts, are  finding\r\n\r\nit  more  and  more  difficult to get drugs and  therefore  they\r\n\r\nreduce the purity level of heroin in the phials supplied to  the\r\n\r\naddicts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have kept the drug situation under control through\r\n\r\na  multi-pronged  strategy of preventive drug  education,  tough\r\n\r\nlaws,  strict  enforcement, rehabilitation and after-care.   The\r\n\r\nNational  Council  Against  Drug  Abuse  (NCADA),  the   Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics  Bureau, the voluntary organisations,  all  work  very\r\n\r\nclosely  together with the schools, the youth organisations,  to\r\n\r\norganise  preventive drug education talks.  Anti-drug  seminars,\r\n\r\nexhibitions, advertising campaigns are also conducted  regularly\r\n\r\nto  raise  the  public's awareness about  the  dangers  of  drug\r\n\r\nconsumption.  CNB  has  also  kept up  very  heavy  pressure  on\r\n\r\ntraffickers  and abusers.  In 1997, CNB mounted a  total  of  46\r\n\r\nmajor  operations which crippled 26 drug trafficking syndicates,\r\n\r\nand resulted in 2,150 arrests.  It also conducted a total of 110\r\n\r\nraids and checksed on night entertainment outlets last year.  As\r\n\r\na  result  of these raids, 200 people were arrested for  ecstasy\r\n\r\nabuse,  while  two  nightclub entertainment  outlets  had  their\r\n\r\noperating  hours actually reduced for allowing their patrons  to\r\n\r\nuse the place for drug taking.  These raids serve as a very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrong signal to the nightclub entertainment operators that   it\r\n\r\nis their responsibility to help keep their premises drug free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will not let up on the strong enforcement\r\n\r\nactions against the traffickers and abusers.  So far, just  this\r\n\r\nyear,  three  major  operations have been  mounted  against  the\r\n\r\nsyndicates and four dragnet operations were also mounted against\r\n\r\nthe abusers.  93 and 457 offenders respectively were arrested in\r\n\r\nthese operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some Members may have read in the papers in the last few\r\n\r\ndays,   Operation Phantom, which CNB mounted over the  last  few\r\n\r\ndays, saw the biggest heroin haul from a single syndicate in its\r\n\r\nhistory  that  resulted in the seizure of more  than  47  kg  of\r\n\r\nheroin  which is worth  more than $2 million in the market.   We\r\n\r\nalso  confiscated  116 phials of liquid ice  as  well  as  small\r\n\r\namounts  of  cannabis and other kinds of drugs.  A total  of  29\r\n\r\nsuspects were arrested, of whom 10 may face the capital charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1996, I have spoken several times of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention to take very tough measures against hard-core opiate addicts. Unlike  what  Mr Chen has understood, we have  so  far  not\r\n\r\ncaned repeated addicts when we send them to court.  The law  has\r\n\r\nnot  come into force yet.  But the law will come into force when\r\n\r\nthe new amendments are made in this Parliament some time later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these hard-core addicts, if they are convicted, they\r\n\r\nwill  be sentenced to a long term imprisonment of up to 13 years\r\n\r\nand  12  strokes of the cane.  Feedback from the prison officers\r\n\r\nindicate  that these announcements alone have had an  impact  on\r\n\r\nthe  DRC  addicts.  This is shown, for example, in the declining\r\n\r\nnumber  of third timer and above addicts in the DRC.  The number\r\n\r\nof  third  timer and above addicts fell from 2,850  in  1995  to\r\n\r\n2,010  in 1997.  In other words, fewer of the hard-core  addicts\r\n\r\nare  now  under  detention in the DRCs  as  a  result  of  these\r\n\r\nannouncements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehabilitation and after-care is an integral part of the\r\n\r\nMinistry's multi-pronged approach towards fighting drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur  rehabilitation programme provides treatment and  after-care\r\n\r\nsupport,  and  also employment opportunities  for  the  released\r\n\r\naddicts.   Under  the  community-based rehabilitation  programme\r\n\r\n(CBR),  more  than  500  inmates  have  been  emplaced  on   the\r\n\r\nNaltrexone  programme since 1995.  Mr Kenneth Chen  asked  about\r\n\r\nthe success of the Naltrexone programme.  It is too early to say\r\n\r\nhow  successful it will be, because the assessment time ,  which\r\n\r\nis the completion rate, is not due yet.  It will only be in June\r\n\r\nthis  year.  It is only after , after two years of being on  the\r\n\r\nNaltrexone programme, that we will know whether or not they will\r\n\r\ngo back to drugs.  But so far, after completing one year without\r\n\r\nany  breach  of conditions, we have seen that more than  80%  of\r\n\r\nthem  are  still  on  the  programme.  This  is  a  marked\r\n\r\nimprovement  compared  to  the  50%  completion  rate  for   the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation programme before June 1995.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the CBR programme, addicts are also released into the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  eg,  into  half-way houses to  continue  with  their\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  programme  in  a  more  supportive  environment.\r\n\r\nAgencies  such as SANA and SCORE are also providing  counselling\r\n\r\nand aftercare services to these ex-addicts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing employment opportunity is also an important\r\n\r\naspect  to  the  successful rehabilitation of the drug  addicts.\r\n\r\nAgencies  like  SCORE have  a number of schemes  to  help  these\r\n\r\naddicts  inculcate  in  them a strong  work  ethic  and  instill\r\n\r\nconfidence  and discipline in them, so that they can  remain  in\r\n\r\nthe  workforce.   So  far, 14,000 inmates  and  ex-inmates  have\r\n\r\nbenefitted from the SCORE's job placement services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sort of problems do we face in tackling this drug\r\n\r\naddict situation?  The Government and its agencies and the  non-Government  agencies face two main challenges in  tackling  this\r\n\r\nproblem.  Firstly, they need more active volunteers to assist in\r\n\r\nthe  after-care of these discharged inmates.  However  good  the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation programmes are, these programmes will not succeed\r\n\r\nunless  the organisations have enough volunteers and counsellors\r\n\r\nwho  are dedicated and committed to the rehabilitation cause  to\r\n\r\nimplement these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   Secondly, the community must be  prepared  to  re-accept into its ranks the ex-addicts who genuinely want to  turn\r\n\r\nover  a new leaf and give them a second chance.  Ex-addicts  who\r\n\r\nhave  strong support from their family members and their friends\r\n\r\nare  those who are most likely to kick off the habit.   Changing\r\n\r\nsocial  prejudices  and attitudes would take  time,  but  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  we must continue to work at  to  help  the  ex-addicts successfully re-assimilate into our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the privatisation of services, Mr Chng said that police\r\n\r\nofficers  should not waste their training by doing things  which\r\n\r\nare not germane to their training or mission.  Let me assure him\r\n\r\nthat  the  Police always reviews its services to make sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  services itthey performs are in line with itstheir mission,\r\n\r\nand if they are not, itwe  will find other agencies who are most\r\n\r\ncapable of doing them.  Since we train officers to a high  level\r\n\r\nof  efficiency and proficiency, we do not want them  to  perform\r\n\r\nnon-essential  functions which are not police  functions.   Then\r\n\r\nthe  police  officers who are freed from all these non-essential\r\n\r\nfunctions can spend more time on crime prevention, investigation\r\n\r\nand  maintaining law and order. For example, the Traffic  Police\r\n\r\nhas  already privatised the towing of illegally parked  vehicles\r\n\r\nto  private contractors.  ItThey  no longer tows these  vehicles\r\n\r\naway.  The driving centres are also now privatised.  Police used\r\n\r\nto  run  athe  driving centre, but this has now been privatised.\r\n\r\nFor big organisers who want to organise big events which involve\r\n\r\na  lot  of  people  and they need crowd control,  unless  it  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  necessary  for the purpose of  maintaining  law  and\r\n\r\norder  and  the police hasve an interest in it, like a  national\r\n\r\nfunction, we will also ask these organisers to employ their  own\r\n\r\nguards to safeguard the place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police will also be reviewing other types of services\r\n\r\nto  see  whether they can be transferred to other Ministries  or\r\n\r\nother agencies. For example, noise pollution.  I know that  from\r\n\r\ntime to time residents would ring up and say, \"This construction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsite is making a lot of noise.  My neighbour is making a lot  of\r\n\r\nnoise.   Please  come  and stop them from  making  noise.\"   The\r\n\r\npolice  will not do that in future.  The police will  rightfully\r\n\r\npass  this  on  to the right Ministry to tackle noise  pollution\r\n\r\nfrom  construction sites.  We also know that from time  to  time\r\n\r\npeople  will call up the police and say, \"So and so urinates  in\r\n\r\nthe  lift.  Please come and arrest him.\"  That again the  police\r\n\r\nwill also in future not do, and it will consider asking the town\r\n\r\ncouncil  or whoever that is the rightful authority to take  over\r\n\r\nthis  task.  For illegal parking in void decks, as Mr Chng said,\r\n\r\nweyou  do not need a fully-trained police officer to book people\r\n\r\nfor  parking  illegally.  We  will also  consider  passing  this\r\n\r\nfunction  to  the  right  people.  As I said,  the  police  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to review its roles and functions to ensure that  they\r\n\r\nstay focused on crime prevention and maintaining law and order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin has asked about the Traffic Police\r\n\r\ndepartment and whether the Singapore Police Force is really  the\r\n\r\nright  place  for  the Traffic Police to be sited  in.   He  has\r\n\r\npresented a number of good reasons why the Traffic Police should\r\n\r\nbe  merged with the LTA.  I am not averse to that. In fact, some\r\n\r\ntime  ago, I did study this and I did put up such a proposal  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Communications and they declined.  I think they\r\n\r\nhave  good  reasons not to do it.  I have decided to  leave  the\r\n\r\nmatter  be.   But if the Ministry of Communications  decides  to\r\n\r\ntake  this over, I have no objection.  I will leave it to  them.\r\n\r\nBut  if Prof. Chin  thinks that it is better to do so,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest   he   also   takes  it  up  with   the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommunications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen is concerned about the traffic accidents\r\n\r\nand  the number of traffic accidents that he reads about in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.   He is concerned whether the Traffic  Police\r\n\r\nhas  studied the causes of these accidents and whether it is due\r\n\r\nto  the  training of the drivers or due to speeding, or whatever\r\n\r\nreason.   He  has  suggested  lowering  the  speed  limits   for\r\n\r\nprobationer drivers and motorcyclists.  Let me just quickly give\r\n\r\nhim some statistics on the causes of accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 1996 and also in 1997, the major cause of\r\n\r\naccidents is speeding, which accounts for at least a quarter  of\r\n\r\nthe number of accidents.  The other causes are careless driving,\r\n\r\ninconsiderate driving and so on.  Whether it is due to  training\r\n\r\nor  not,  we know that when we go for training we obey  all  the\r\n\r\nrules  and everything the instructor tells us.  Sometimes, after\r\n\r\nwe  have passed, some of us do forget some of the rules that  we\r\n\r\nhave  learnt and decided to take short cuts.  I think all of  us\r\n\r\nwere  taught not to speed.  I am sure many of us do.  All of  us\r\n\r\nwere  taught not to beat the red light.  I am sure that some  of\r\n\r\nus also do.  So really the responsibility is that of the driver.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whether there is a serious concern about the number of\r\n\r\naccidents  or  not,  certainly we are very  concerned.   Of  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  accidents we had last year, 257  people  died  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of road accidents and that number is slightly more  than\r\n\r\nthe  previous  year of 225.  Of these 200-odd  fatalities  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  road accidents, about 110 of them are either  motor-cyclists  or  their pillions. We are  also  very\r\n\r\nconcerned  about the motorcyclists because, of  this  number  of\r\n\r\nfatalities of motorcyclists and pillion riders, about\r\n\r\none-third of them are Malaysians who come here to work or  visit\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, his suggestion about lowering the speed limit by\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists and also by probationary drivers can be studied by\r\n\r\nthe police.  But let me tell him that I have also asked them  to\r\n\r\ndo  this  some time ago and they have told me that it is  really\r\n\r\nnot   so   practical  to  enforce  a  lower  speed   limit   for\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists.  You must be on the road all the time  to  be  on\r\n\r\nthe  watch-out to make sure that they do not speed, and then you\r\n\r\ncan  book  them.  If you do not see them, they will be  speeding\r\n\r\nanyway.   Not  just motorcyclists but also motor  cars.   So\r\n\r\nbasically,  we are talking about enforcement and to do  this  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  have  other  means  of  helping  the  Traffic  Police,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  mobile  squad, in tackling  this  problem  of\r\n\r\nspeeding.  One of the things that we will do is the installation\r\n\r\nof  more  speed  cameras on our expressways.  We have  installed\r\n\r\nquite  a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber of speed cameras already and more such speed cameras will\r\n\r\nbe installed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police will continue to have campaigns to\r\n\r\neducate our motorists.   and mMany campaigns are organised right\r\n\r\nthrough the year, whether they are drink driving campaign, don't\r\n\r\ndrink  and  drive  at  the  same  time,  don't  speed,  be  more\r\n\r\ncourteous,  and so on.  In a few months' time, we will  organise\r\n\r\nanother speed management campaign to raise the awareness of  the\r\n\r\nmotoring  public  of the dangers and consequences  of  speeding.\r\n\r\nBut one effective way of dealing with people who speed is really\r\n\r\nto  raise  the  penalty  for speeding in terms  of  raising  the\r\n\r\ndemerit points and probably even raising the fines.  The  police\r\n\r\nis  studying  this.  If, instead of 6 points  for  a  particular\r\n\r\noffence  or 9 points for a particular offence, thesey  were   to\r\n\r\nbe  increased  the  demerit points, then moreit  will  take  the\r\n\r\nmotorists  will  be  taken off the road sooner  than  under  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  system.  The Traffic Police is also reviewing the  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Act to make sure that they are in line with the current\r\n\r\nproblems that we face.  If the law needs to be amended, we  will\r\n\r\ncertainly amend the law to make sure our roads remain  safe  for\r\n\r\neverybody,  not just motorists but also pedestrians who  form  a\r\n\r\nsignificant group of people being killed on our roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

This is indeed something we can be proud of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Force plays a very important role in ensuring\r\n\r\nour  internal  security,  just as the armed  forces  ensure  our\r\n\r\nprotection  against invasion from outside.   Once  our  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  is threatened, not only will our people's daily  lives\r\n\r\nbe  affected,  the foreign investors will also be  scared  away.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  job  of the Police is very important  and  very\r\n\r\nchallenging.  For this reason, while we need to attract talented\r\n\r\npeople  to  join the Police Force, we must also  find  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  to  recruit  and  retain  the  capable,  experienced  and\r\n\r\ndedicated policemen to keep up the good work of the Police Force\r\n\r\nand to ensure that the crime rate is kept under control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the moment, if young people who reach the age in\r\n\r\nwhich  they  are  liable for national service join  the  regular\r\n\r\npolice force, they will be exempted from national service  after\r\n\r\nfive  years. If we are unable to retain these experienced police\r\n\r\nofficers  after they have completed five years of service,  then\r\n\r\nwe  will  have a rather serious problem at hand.  We are  losing\r\n\r\nexperienced  police  officers.  The Police Force  will  have  to\r\n\r\nrecruit new officers and train them afresh.  Training will  take\r\n\r\nquite  a  period of time, and the operations of the Police  will\r\n\r\nsurely be affected.   What we are worried is that more and  more\r\n\r\nyoung people are enrolling in the Police Force as an alternative\r\n\r\nto  national  service.    As soon as they have  completed  their\r\n\r\nmandatory  period  of  service,  they  will  leave  the   Force.\r\n\r\nRecruits  with  `O' level passes who  have not  completed  their\r\n\r\nnational  service, get a starting pay of $1,350.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  those who  go for 2 1/2 years of full-time national  service\r\n\r\nin  the  army are paid some $200 to $300.  So from the financial\r\n\r\npoint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  view, it is very attractive for these national servicemen to\r\n\r\njoin the Police Force, because they can get better pay.  But the\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  after five years, how do we retain  them  in  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force, and make them take Police as a life-long  career?\r\n\r\nIf  we  cannot retain them, then the Police Force will face  the\r\n\r\nquestion of manpower shortage every year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the Police can consider the following\r\n\r\nsuggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, apart from adjusting the pay for the Police\r\n\r\nofficers, we must also increase various kinds of allowances, eg,\r\n\r\nshift  allowance, children's education insurance or  dependants'\r\n\r\nallowance.   Police officers will not have to worry about  their\r\n\r\nfamilies when they carry on  their duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must extend the five-year Police service bond\r\n\r\nin order to be eligible for exemption from national service.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  in the recruitment exercise last year, for  the  700\r\n\r\nvacancies,  there were only 300 applicants.   About 88% of  them\r\n\r\nwere  more  interested in exemption from national  service  than\r\n\r\nservice   in  the  Police.   So  if  we  extend  this  five-year\r\n\r\nqualifying period for exemption from national service,  then  we\r\n\r\nwill   be  able  to  attract  those  people  who  are  genuinely\r\n\r\ninterested in joining the Police Force rather than those who are\r\n\r\nonly  using  the  5-year  stint as a  means  to  avoid  national\r\n\r\nservice.   In  this way, the Police will be better  able  to  do\r\n\r\ntheir long-term planning for manpower and training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we know that the retirement age for junior officer\r\n\r\nis  45.   I know that many junior officers who have reached  the\r\n\r\nretirement age  do not want to remain in the Police Force.   Our\r\n\r\nretirement age at the national level is 60, and will be extended\r\n\r\nto 62.   I think retiring police officers at 45 years is a waste\r\n\r\nof manpower.  The Police should review the conditions of service\r\n\r\nand  to  persuade those with a good service record  to  continue\r\n\r\nserving  in the Police Force.  They can put in another 17  years\r\n\r\nof useful service to the Police Force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that the Police job is a very challenging\r\n\r\none.  Our security, our children, our family's security are all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndependent  on the Police officers.  They are the pillar  of  our\r\n\r\nsocial  order  and discipline.  We need capable and  experienced\r\n\r\nofficers  to  stay in the Police Force to lower our crime  rates\r\n\r\nand  to  ensure our safety and security.  But when they  enforce\r\n\r\ntheir  duties, they have to risk their lives.  So we  must  give\r\n\r\nthem  better  pay  and better care.  I think this  is  something\r\n\r\nworth our consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister if a central database on spousal\r\n\r\nviolence  and  child  abuse  cases is  now  set  up  within  the\r\n\r\noperation unit of the Police Force.  I am not referring  to  the\r\n\r\narchival database on dysfunctional families established  by  MCD\r\n\r\nnor  the  quantitative  large-scale data survey  that  they  are\r\n\r\ncollecting  at  this point.  I am referring  to  operation  data\r\n\r\nwhich will enable police officers to better protect victims with\r\n\r\nchildren, at the same time closely monitor perpetrators' violent\r\n\r\nbehaviour.  This idea was first mooted by the Ministry in 1995.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police operation data is important for four reasons:\r\n\r\n(1) clearly establishes patterns of criminal behaviour over\r\n\r\ntime on  where, when, what and how the crime was committed; what  \r\n\r\nage groups, ethnic groups and kind of dangerous weapons used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Capturing data helps guide intervention, policy\r\n\r\nformulation,  as  well  as  identify  the  appropriate  security\r\n\r\nmeasures and case management decisions.  Let me give an example.\r\n\r\nIf  we only know the total number of rape cases and not indicate\r\n\r\nthe age groups of the victims, we may be misguided in the way we\r\n\r\nplan  our  community crime prevention programmes.   If  the  age\r\n\r\ngroups  of  victims  are  older,  a  community-based  prevention\r\n\r\ncampaign,  with  the  support of all forms  of  media,  is  more\r\n\r\nsuitable  to help increase awareness of this threat.  To  combat\r\n\r\nteen  rape,  however,  the  target should  be  aimed  at  school\r\n\r\nteenagers  and  street youth gangs.  Teachers and  youth  groups\r\n\r\nhave  to  be mobilised to talk to school teenagers about threats\r\n\r\nand self-protection.  In police training, soliciting information\r\n\r\nfrom a teenager is a different experience from investigating  an\r\n\r\nadult victim.  The police\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore  needs to know the trend and focus their  training  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping different sets of interviewing skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Enhance coordination with FSCs. With the amendments\r\n\r\nto  the  Women's Charter now implemented and the setting  up  of\r\n\r\nisland-wide  networking loop initiated by MCD  and  MHA,  police\r\n\r\nofficers now have additional network channels, through FSCs,  to\r\n\r\nenforce  case  management.   It will  be  helpful  if  the  data\r\n\r\ncaptured  by  the  Police  could be electronically  e-mailed  to\r\n\r\nselect  FSCs  appointed by MCD to take in  police  referrals  on\r\n\r\nspousal violence and child abuse.  Then together, both FSCs  and\r\n\r\nthe Police can reinforce protection to the families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Similar cross-checks on victims and their case\r\n\r\nhistory can be effectively achieved by electronically linking up\r\n\r\nthe  island-wide  Police network of NPCs and NPPs  to  guarantee\r\n\r\nfast   response   to,   and  close  monitoring   of,   high-risk\r\n\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seek the Minister's urgent attention to this matter for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of enhancing policy formulation and enforcing  good\r\n\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would you like to move on, Mdm Chiang?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  the  planning for the Community  Focused  Plan  to\r\n\r\nassure effective community intervention programmes, if he  would\r\n\r\nconsider employing social workers in the Police Force,  as  done\r\n\r\nin  the  courts,  hospitals and schools, for the  following  two\r\n\r\nreasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, cross-boundary skills enhance police enforcement\r\n\r\nduties in difficult family disputes such as spousal violence and\r\n\r\nchild  abuse;  similarly, in traumatic  cases  like  rape.   The\r\n\r\nargument is, by combining the efforts of the social workers  and\r\n\r\npolice  during investigation in such cases, both groups can  add\r\n\r\nvalue  to the assessment of the case by offering varying imports\r\n\r\ngathered  from  their  respective  training.   This  effort   is\r\n\r\nparticularly helpful in cases where criminal evidence cannot  be\r\n\r\nestablished, yet expert opinions are needed to help  assess  the\r\n\r\nrisk levels of families in crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job of the Police is not merely to prosecute but to\r\n\r\nprotect.   Where prosecution evidence is lacking, protection  to\r\n\r\nvictims  must still be assured, and I argue it takes  a  trained\r\n\r\nskill  from  a counselling background to observe the  signs  and\r\n\r\ncues  of  potential  hurt  faced  by  the  family  members.   By\r\n\r\nreinforcing  the  criminal  processes with  psycho-socio  inputs\r\n\r\nduring  investigation, we help to moderate the too  often  cited\r\n\r\ncriticism  that the Police, in the handling of family cases,  is\r\n\r\ntoo  focused  on  prosecution  procedures  and  less  on  victim\r\n\r\nprotection.   In  rape cases, in particular, the  victim  is  in\r\n\r\ntraumatic  state.   By  clearly establishing  the  investigation\r\n\r\nroles  of police enforcement officers and police social workers,\r\n\r\nthe former to adopt a line of questioning to establish facts  on\r\n\r\nthe  act  of  violence and the latter to restore  the  emotional\r\n\r\nstate  of  the victim through a counselling line of questioning,\r\n\r\ntwo  sets of information can be examined in parallel for a  more\r\n\r\njudicious appraisal and judgment of the case.  Over time, social\r\n\r\nworkers  and police officers, working under one institution  and\r\n\r\nguided  by  the standard operating procedure, could  develop  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding of their complementary roles of police and  social\r\n\r\nworkers throughout the investigative process, and then establish\r\n\r\na  shared  foundation for criminal investigation work in  family\r\n\r\nand rape cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is, at the community level, with the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the amended Women's Charter last year in areas\r\n\r\nof   spousal  violence  management,  police  officers  now  will\r\n\r\ncollaborate with social service agencies in a networking loop to\r\n\r\nrefer victims for counselling.  Within the framework of this new\r\n\r\noperation guidelines, Police social workers can play a key  role\r\n\r\nof being the networker and liaison case workers with FSCs.  In a\r\n\r\nway, the Police social worker becomes an institutional broker by\r\n\r\nincreasing police awareness and usage of community services  and\r\n\r\npromoting police-community relationships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not new ideas. They have been tested in\r\n\r\nother countries.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshortage of social workers is a definite challenge.  But  if  we\r\n\r\nshould let the market of supply self-regulate, the Police  Force\r\n\r\nmay  pick  up the professionals who decide to leave  the  social\r\n\r\nservice sector.  Anyhow, if we recognise this principle as  good\r\n\r\nin itself, we should lead the way and find solutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will study this idea and let it\r\n\r\ngerminate to assess its applicability in our context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, my cut concerns the Registry of\r\n\r\nSocieties  which comes under the Ministry.  My cut  starts  from\r\n\r\nthe  call  by the Prime Minister in this House last year  for  a\r\n\r\ncivil  society,  that  the  Government's  wish  and  vision  for\r\n\r\nSingapore in 21st century is to have a strong people sector with\r\n\r\nself-responsibility by citizens, self organisation by  citizens,\r\n\r\nandkeeping self-help from many helping hands.  I think  this  is\r\n\r\npertinent this year when we look at the coming bad times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people need to organise for a common cause.\r\n\r\nSocieties,   clubs   and  associations  need  an   institutional\r\n\r\nframework.   Article  14  of  our Constitution  gives  them  the\r\n\r\nfundamental right to assemble and associate and the laws provide\r\n\r\nthat  without  registration as a lawful  society,  they  may  be\r\n\r\nguilty of illegal assembly or other offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present laws do allow citizens to register as\r\n\r\nsocieties with the Registrar of Societies.  But the present laws\r\n\r\nalso  give  a very wide discretion to the Registrar of Societies\r\n\r\nwhether  to  register  them.  Clause 4  creates  exceptions  for\r\n\r\nissues,  such as security and national interest.  I do not  urge\r\n\r\nthat  these  principles are wrong.  These principles are  right.\r\n\r\nBut  the  law,  as  it  stands, does  not  allow  for  delay  in\r\n\r\nregistration  almost  indefinitely, and it  gives  a  very  wide\r\n\r\ndiscretion  to  the  Registrar and the  Ministry  based  on  the\r\n\r\npossibility that something might go wrong, not a reality.  As an\r\n\r\nexample,  if  I  may  draw  from  my  own  experience  with  the\r\n\r\nRoundtable  of  which I am a member, it took  this  society  two\r\n\r\nyears to be registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the actual number of such delays in registrations may\r\n\r\nbe small but I believe there is a perception among citizens that\r\n\r\nthere  could be many obstacles into registering societies.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  it  has been observed in some reports by international\r\n\r\nNGOs that there are no human rights societies in Singapore.  And\r\n\r\nthis  is clearly an ill perception because Singapore, in  recent\r\n\r\nyears,  has  acceded to human rights treaties  and  has  in  its\r\n\r\nConstitution, fundamental liberties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my cut proposes to suggest to the Minister that it is\r\n\r\ntimely  to  change  the  laws and change the  functions  of  the\r\n\r\nRegistry,  ie, to keep the discretionary powers of the Registrar\r\n\r\nto the minimum, to set a time limit for the Registrar to respond\r\n\r\nyes or no.  A, and it is my hope that registration of societies,\r\n\r\nclubs,  this people sector, would become automatic for Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  with a minimum of discretion, such as you  are  not  a\r\n\r\nbankrupt  or  suffer  from  some other basic  disqualifications.\r\n\r\nThis   analogy  for  automatic  registration  is   not   without\r\n\r\nprecedent.   It  can  already be done for  the  registration  of\r\n\r\nprivate companies, for businesses.  Should not the people sector\r\n\r\nbe as free as businesses?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in making the suggestion, I am still mindful that a\r\n\r\nsociety once registered would still be subject to other laws  on\r\n\r\nsecurity,  public order, etc.  This is not a situation  of  free\r\n\r\nlicence.   It is merely to give a licence to register.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nthe  role of the Registry of Societies should be changed to  one\r\n\r\nthat is more supportive and nurturing rather than policing,  one\r\n\r\nthat   is   like  the  National  Council  of  Social   Services,\r\n\r\nsupporting charities.  The Registry  of  Societies\r\n\r\nshould,  in my view, allow, promote and facilitate civil society\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are already many obstacles to self-organisation\r\n\r\nby citizens - time, work and other exigencies.  The Minister and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  would help us move towards civil society  in  the\r\n\r\n21st century Singapore by allowing the registration of societies\r\n\r\nto be amended in the way I have suggested.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, first, let me answer Mr Ong Ah\r\n\r\nHeng's question about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextending   the  minimum term of engagement  of  those  national\r\n\r\nservice liable persons who serve in the Police Force.  NS liable\r\n\r\npersons  are allowed to serve not just in the Police  Force  but\r\n\r\nalso  in  the  Singapore Armed Forces as well as  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nCivil  Defence Force.  The minimum period is really five  years,\r\n\r\nthat is, about double their NS full-time liability.  The minimum\r\n\r\nterm of engagement (MTE) for Police was reduced from eight years\r\n\r\nto  five years to attract more of such NS liable persons to join\r\n\r\nthe Police Force.  In the past, we had eight years.  I think the\r\n\r\nresults  were not that good and that is why we decided to  bring\r\n\r\nit down to five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These MTE police officers play an essential role in\r\n\r\nensuring  the  safety  and  security  of  Singapore  and   their\r\n\r\ncontributions are no less than those who serve the full-time  NS\r\n\r\nin  the  SAF, the Police or the Civil Defence.  They have chosen\r\n\r\nto  serve  their extended period as regulars in order to  fulfil\r\n\r\ntheir full-time NS obligations.  But when they leave after  five\r\n\r\nyears of the MTE, they will be liable as operational ready NSmen\r\n\r\nand their training which they receive while in full-time regular\r\n\r\nPolice Force will not be wasted because they will still have  to\r\n\r\ndo their NS while in the Police.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to Mr Ong's impression that many of them left the\r\n\r\nservice  after five years, the statistics do not  seem  to  show\r\n\r\nthat.   Between 1984 and 1992, an average of 67%  of  those  who\r\n\r\nserved  their NS under the MTE scheme remained with  the  Police\r\n\r\nForce.   I think that is a pretty good retention rate.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthose  who did not stay on decided to go for further studies  or\r\n\r\nhave  found other jobs, which is quite natural for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nIf  they want to find something else to do, they will do so.  So\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think  there is a need therefore to extend  the  MTE\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  five-year period.  A better approach  would  be  to\r\n\r\nencourage these officers on the MTE scheme to remain by offering\r\n\r\nthem  a more fulfiling job, enlarged job, better training,  more\r\n\r\nsatisfying  opportunities for career advancement and  give  them\r\n\r\ncompetitive  terms and conditions which we have  recently  done.\r\n\r\nHopefully, with all these measures, they will remain with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  even if they were to leave, it is no loss because they will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be liable for NS under the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong's suggestion about rehiring those junior officers\r\n\r\nwho  retire  at  the  age  of 45 is  already  being  done.   For\r\n\r\noOfficerss whose performance is good, we will ccontinue  to  re-employ  them  on  contract.  So long as they  are  operationally\r\n\r\nefficient and continue to be able to do their best, we will give\r\n\r\nthem a job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I just deal with the point which I forgot to answer\r\n\r\nProf.  Chin  just  now  about  electronic  surveillance  in  HDB\r\n\r\nestates,  car  parks, void decks, and so on.  We do  not  see  a\r\n\r\nmajor  need in this area.  But I know that in some HDB  estates,\r\n\r\nthey already have such security systems.  In Bedok, for example,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  system  where the residents can  help  to  monitor\r\n\r\nthemselves.  But if there is a need and the community feels that\r\n\r\nthere is a need, the Police will help them set up such a system.\r\n\r\nThe  Police  will not be able to invest resources and  money  in\r\n\r\nsetting  up  the system.  But in places where we  have  a  large\r\n\r\ncongregation of people from time to time and we need to  find  a\r\n\r\nway  to  effectively police the area, the Police is  considering\r\n\r\nhaving  a  mobile surveillance system.  For example,  in  Little\r\n\r\nIndia  or  in  places where large crowds of people  gather,  the\r\n\r\nPolice  is thinking of buying the mobile surveillance system  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  with the Police work.  I will leave it to  Prof.  Ho\r\n\r\nPeng Kee to answer the other questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me take NMP Mdm\r\n\r\nClaire  Chiang's point.  Mdm Chiang asked if a central  database\r\n\r\non  family violence cases can be set up.  I am pleased to inform\r\n\r\nher that the Ministry of Community Development is leading a task\r\n\r\nforce, comprising representatives from MHA, Police, Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  and  the National University of Singapore to  develop  a\r\n\r\ncentral  database on abused victims and family  violence  cases.\r\n\r\nThe  online  database  will  not only facilitate  research  into\r\n\r\nfamily  violence  cases but will also assist frontline  officers\r\n\r\nfrom MCD, Police and the Health Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  operational work.  I think this was  her  concern.   It\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  just an archival database, but  one  where  the\r\n\r\nparties can tap online to help them in their work.  I understand\r\n\r\nthat  MCD has established the basic requirements of the database\r\n\r\nand  will commence its study on the systems design soon.  Police\r\n\r\nwill do its part in the context of this Committee and I will ask\r\n\r\nthem to bear Mdm Chiang's points in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion that she made is whether MHA could\r\n\r\nconsider employing social workers in the Police Force.  Sir, our\r\n\r\nresponse is that it is not really necessary for Police to employ\r\n\r\nfull-time   social  workers  as  cases  requiring  social   work\r\n\r\nexpertise  occur sporadically.  Police is nevertheless  prepared\r\n\r\nto   consider   making  arrangements  with   voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  to  have social workers on  a  standby  basis  to\r\n\r\nassist  Police as and when needed.  Instead of Police  employing\r\n\r\nsocial workers full time, a better approach and a more effective\r\n\r\none  in  the  longer  term is for Police and social  workers  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a good and close working relationship with one another.\r\n\r\nI  am  glad  that,  and  indeed  this  has  been  so.   T,  this\r\n\r\ncollaboration  and  synergy  has  evolved  steadily,  especially\r\n\r\noverfor  the  last three years, and I believe  with  Mdm  Chiang\r\n\r\nplaying  a  part  in  bringing this about.   Police  and  social\r\n\r\nworkers now cooperate and coordinate closely with each other  at\r\n\r\nboth  policy  formulation and ground operation levels.   At  the\r\n\r\npolicy level, the Director of Operations of the Singapore Police\r\n\r\nForce chairs the Women and Family Violence Committee, comprising\r\n\r\nmembers from MCD, MOH and VWOs, such as the Singapore Council of\r\n\r\nWomen  Organisations  and the Society Against  Family  Violence.\r\n\r\nThe Committee sets out and reviews the work processes of various\r\n\r\nagencies  involved in managing family violence.  It also  serves\r\n\r\nas  an  avenue  to  explore  new  strategies  to  handle  family\r\n\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground level, medical social workers refer suspected\r\n\r\nabuse  cases to police officers stationed in hospitals.   Police\r\n\r\nofficers   also   work   with  social  work   counsellors   when\r\n\r\ninvestigating rape, juvenile delinquency and family violence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases.   Police  have also worked out guidelines  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nfamily  violence cases jointly with relevant agencies,  such  as\r\n\r\nMCD and the VWOs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang talks about the Community Focused Plans that the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home  Affairs has mentioned  earlier  on.   Every\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  Police Post (NPP) is linked to a  Family  Service\r\n\r\nCentre  to  which the NPP can refer victims of spousal  violence\r\n\r\nfor counselling and conflict resolution.  But besides responding\r\n\r\nto  cases,  managing  the scene of incident,  investigating  and\r\n\r\nprosecuting  offenders, the police officers also advise  victims\r\n\r\nof  spousal violence on the courses of action available, such as\r\n\r\nthe  taking  out of Personal Protection Orders from the  courts.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Police can arrange for the victim and the offending\r\n\r\nparty  to undergo conflict resolution and recommend recalcitrant\r\n\r\ncases  for court action.  This is one of the refinements  Police\r\n\r\nhas  made in dealing with family violence crimes and victims  of\r\n\r\nsuch crimes, something again introduceddone over the last two to\r\n\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang talks about the need for police officers and\r\n\r\nsocial counsellors to understand each other's mindset so  as  to\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  effectively work together.  She is  probably  also\r\n\r\naware  that  police and social workers conduct  cross-  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for one another.  For example, Police has  conducted\r\n\r\nlectures  for social workers and MCD staff on police  procedures\r\n\r\nand  handling of family violence cases.  Likewise,  the  Society\r\n\r\nAgainst  Family  Violence  has conducted  workshops  for  police\r\n\r\nofficers to equip them with the relevant knowledge and skills in\r\n\r\ndealing with abuse cases, such as family violence.  Such  cross-training  has  helped the police and social  workers  to  better\r\n\r\nunderstand  each  other's role in handling  of  family  violence\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we feel this is a better approach. To find ways to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  these working ties between police  and  social  work\r\n\r\nagencies.   It  produces all the benefits that  Mdm  Chiang  has\r\n\r\ntalked  about, and more, better synergy and complementarity  can\r\n\r\nbe  found  this way than by the Police Force employing  its  own\r\n\r\nsocial workers.  This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproach, we feel, taps diverse community expertise in different\r\n\r\nways  of  counselling  and  fosters  community  involvement  and\r\n\r\nownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now respond to Mr Tay's point as to whether or\r\n\r\nnot  the  Registrar of Societies' discretion can be  kept  to  a\r\n\r\nminimum.   First, let me say that the objective of the Societies\r\n\r\nAct  is  to ensure that groups which may pose a threat to public\r\n\r\norder  and  national  security  interest  are  not  allowed   to\r\n\r\nestablish themselves in Singapore.  I am sure Mr Tay agrees with\r\n\r\nthat objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar of Societies does not really have a wide\r\n\r\ndiscretion to reject applications.  Under the Societies Act, the\r\n\r\nRegistrar can reject an application when the group is likely  to\r\n\r\nbe  used  for unlawful purposes, or for purposes detrimental  to\r\n\r\npublic  peace, national security or national interest.  But  let\r\n\r\nme  assure  Mr Tay that the Registrar exercises this  discretion\r\n\r\njudiciously and will continue to do so.  And indeed this springs\r\n\r\nfrom  Article  14 that he talked about.  Article  14(2)(c)  also\r\n\r\nmentions the need for parameters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay brings up the point about delay. I think it is a\r\n\r\npoint taken.  In fact, MHA has been monitoring this.  As Members\r\n\r\nknow,  MHA  has  been asking its agencies to  serve  the  public\r\n\r\nbetter   and,  certainly,  we  have  asked  them  to  facilitate\r\n\r\napplications.   Sometimes, of course, delays are caused  because\r\n\r\nwhen  the ROS makes inquiries, the applicants take some time  to\r\n\r\ncome back.  So it is not entirely the fault of the Registry.   I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is a point well taken.  We will certainly  take  that\r\n\r\ninto  account.   And  indeed we have acted on  it  as  shown  by\r\n\r\nbecause  of  a  recent  measure that we  introduced.   Now,  the\r\n\r\nRegistry   of  Societies  provides  applicants  with   a   draft\r\n\r\nconstitution  based on model rules, because some applicants  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  very clear as to how to proceed to apply.  The Registry\r\n\r\nwould  readily  approve any application which adopts  the  draft\r\n\r\nmodel constitution provided as long as the society is not set up\r\n\r\nfor  unlawful  or  unacceptable purposes.  Any proposed  society\r\n\r\nwhich feels that its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication has been unfairly treated may appeal to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Home Affairs for further consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this approach that we have adopted does not really run\r\n\r\ncounter  to efforts to build an active civil society.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nit  can  be  said that this approach really keeps at  bay  those\r\n\r\ngroups whose formation will pose a threat to the interests of an\r\n\r\nactive civil society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> The on-line database that was\r\n\r\nset  up by MCD has taken some time to realise.

It  was\r\n\r\na  recommendation  of the inter-Ministry work  group  on  family\r\n\r\nviolence  chaired  by the then Deputy Secretary  (Home  Affairs)\r\n\r\nmade  in December 1995.  And then a task force was set up  under\r\n\r\nMCD  because the committee felt that MCD was the best agency  to\r\n\r\ndrive  this  project.   The  delay was  caused  partly  because,\r\n\r\noriginally, it was conceived as an archival type of  database  - which  I am sure Madam Chiang agrees would not be of much use  - and then it was to converted it into an operational database and\r\n\r\nthat  delayed it somewhat.  Let me assure Madam Chiang that  the\r\n\r\nproject  will  now proceed at a clip.

The White Paper on health  care  has\r\n\r\nspelt out the strategic direction which will establish Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  quality medical centre, not only for our people but  also\r\n\r\nfor those who may come to Singapore to seek medical treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of this programme depends critically on the\r\n\r\nnumber  and  quality  of  the  medical  staff  we  can  harness.\r\n\r\nIncreasing  enrolment in NUS and the Ministry's move to  attract\r\n\r\nforeign  doctors and nurses in the last few years will  go  some\r\n\r\nway  to  meet this demand.  Would the Minister inform the  House\r\n\r\nthe progress made in meeting these targets?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional economic difficulties have prevented many\r\n\r\npeople  from  the countries in the region to seek  treatment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I  understand that some hospitals  which  cater  to\r\n\r\nforeign  patients  have  already taken  steps  to  downsize  the\r\n\r\nfacilities.   And doctors who look after foreign  patients  have\r\n\r\nalso  reported some heavy losses in business.  The question,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, is whether the present downturn is temporary and  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore, not affect the longer-term demand.  Can the  Minister\r\n\r\ncomment on the impact caused by this current drop in demand?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Maarine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nover  the past few years, private hospitals havemedical practice\r\n\r\nhas  developed  quite  rapidly  in  Singapore.   Some  of  these\r\n\r\nhospitals  medical  practitioners  have  already  evolved   into\r\n\r\nmedical  groups and they are continuously expanding their  scope\r\n\r\nof  practice.   One  of these groups has even become  a  public-listed   company.   I  feel  that  the  development  of  private\r\n\r\nhospitals  medical practice may result in  some brain  drain  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  doctors and nurses to the private  sector,   causing\r\n\r\nacute  shortage of medical staff in the public and  restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals.  The Chairman of  the GPC for Health has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalready mentioned that admission for medical students in NUS  is\r\n\r\nquite  restricted.  This may be another reason for the  shortage\r\n\r\nof  new supply of doctors.   Apart from all this, I think  there\r\n\r\nmay  be  a  question of income gap and the work pressure,  etc.,\r\n\r\nwhich  have resulted in the migration of Government doctors  and\r\n\r\nnurses from the Government hospitals to the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our GPC's visits to the polyclinics and hospitals,\r\n\r\nwe  discovered that one of the clinics which was supposed to  be\r\n\r\nstaffed  by  12  doctors had only 7 on duty,  a  shortage  of  5\r\n\r\ndoctors.   The same situation applies to nurses.  I  think  this\r\n\r\nmay be a question of social status, remuneration, workload, etc.\r\n\r\nWe should seriously look into the situation and try to find some\r\n\r\nsolutions to resolve the matter.  Otherwise, there may  be  some\r\n\r\nnegative results or undesirable consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, for existing doctors, I think their workload is\r\n\r\nmuch  too heavy, and at the same time, this in turn may  affects\r\n\r\ntheir morale too.  Secondly, there will be a longer waiting time\r\n\r\nfor  ppatients.   And  finally, oOn the whole,  the  quality  of\r\n\r\nmedical  service will be adversely affected.  I understand  that\r\n\r\nthe total number of doctors has been increasing every year.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  in 1987, we had 2,940 doctors.  In 1992, we had  3,960\r\n\r\ndoctors.   Last  year,  we  had 4,916  doctors.   In  1987,  the\r\n\r\ndoctor/patient  ratio was 1:940.  In 1992,  it  was  1:800.   In\r\n\r\n1997, it was 1:760.  I believe that by the year 2010, our target\r\n\r\nis  1:650.  What plans do we have in hand to train more  doctors\r\n\r\nor to have more doctors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of nurses, right now we have about 14,000 nurses.\r\n\r\nBut  by  the year 2000 we will need another extra 3,000.   So  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know whether the Ministry  of  Health  has  any\r\n\r\nmeasures to solve this problem of shortage in nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, our medical infrastructure is very advanced and\r\n\r\nquite good. We have a New Changi Hospital, and the new Tan  Tock\r\n\r\nSeng   Hospital  is  already  under  construction.   To  develop\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  a  regional medical centre or  medical  hub,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve we have all the necessary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhardware.   But  in terms of software, there is still  room  for\r\n\r\nimprovement.   Can the Minister please tell us  what  plans  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health has in place to  resolve all these problems?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, it seems that there\r\n\r\nis  an  enigmatic  exodus of doctors from our  public  hospitals\r\n\r\nevery  year.  This has led to a shortage of doctors and a vacuum\r\n\r\nof  continuity  in  terms of teaching from the  seniors  to  the\r\n\r\njuniors  in  these  hospitals.  We should  try  and  clear  this\r\n\r\nproblem promptly, especially when our healthcare facilities  are\r\n\r\nin  the  midst of rapid change for the better.  Before going  on\r\n\r\nfurther,  I  would like to state that I am a doctor  in  private\r\n\r\nmedical  practice  and  do  not have  any  direct  or  pecuniary\r\n\r\ninterests in this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the shortage of doctors in the public sector has\r\n\r\nto be resolved.  This shortage means over-working the doctors in\r\n\r\nthe   hospitals.   Job-satisfaction  is  lost  and   morale   is\r\n\r\ndiminished.  This, Sir, is not fair to the doctors and  is  also\r\n\r\nnot  good for the patients.  The quality of care that we  expect\r\n\r\nin  our  hospitals  may not be maintained, let  alone  improved,\r\n\r\nunder  these circumstances.  Unsatisfactory work-terms  must  be\r\n\r\nthe  reason  for  the  often-mentioned exodus  of  doctors  from\r\n\r\nGovernment service for private practice.  What are the  problems\r\n\r\nfacing the doctors here?  Perhaps the following factors ought to\r\n\r\nbe looked into:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Unmatched long and tedious working hours in relation to\r\n\r\nremuneration.  Well, this will always be a stumbling  block  for\r\n\r\nthe  public  service.  However, it should be the easier  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems  to  resolve, and it should be resolved in  conjunction\r\n\r\nwith  a  whole  new attitude towards the healthcare  service  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Uncertain prospects for their future in the public sector.\r\n\r\nThe  consideration of a lower income potential together with the\r\n\r\nfear  of being phased down at a time when the energies are lower\r\n\r\nfor  striking  out in the private sector, may be  a  reason  for\r\n\r\npeople  to leave public service sooner than later.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nsolution here may lie with softening the line of demarcation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween  the  private  and  the public  sectors  of  our  health\r\n\r\nservice.    Allow  the  more  senior  doctors   a   choice   for\r\n\r\nproportioned and responsible commitment in both sectors if  they\r\n\r\nwish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The medical officer dilemma. What options are there\r\n\r\nfor  the senior medical officers?  If not private practice as  a\r\n\r\ngeneral practitioner and if not into a specialist trainee  post,\r\n\r\nwhat is there which the public sector can offer on a longer term\r\n\r\nbasis?   There is a need for some sort of career enhancement  in\r\n\r\nthis aspect.  Perhaps, a new work schedule, a new pay scheme and\r\n\r\na   new  hospital status could create a new mindset  and  a  new\r\n\r\nbreed  of  doctors.  If more medical officers can be induced  to\r\n\r\nstay  back  because  they can see a worthy future  as  a  career\r\n\r\nmedical  officer,  there  will be a resultant  positive  effect.\r\n\r\nThere  will be less on-call nights, less pressures in not  being\r\n\r\nspeciality trained, less urgency to leave for full-time  general\r\n\r\npractice.   In this latter aspect, perhaps the more senior  ones\r\n\r\nmay  also  be  given a choice for proportioned  and  responsible\r\n\r\nprivate sector as partners or as locums in the GP clinics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the often lamented vacuum of continuity in the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  junior  doctors by the more  senior  ones  in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals  can worsen. The teaching and training of  our  junior\r\n\r\ndoctors  needs  to be maintained or our standard  of  healthcare\r\n\r\nwill   be  severely  compromised.   The  deficiency  of  capable\r\n\r\nteachers can only be resolved if:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the system allows for more scope and better rewards for\r\n\r\nthose who like to teach and to do research, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) more senior doctors who need to explore their prospects\r\n\r\nin  full-time  private practice are obligated  to  contribute  a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of their time towards the public sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a small and unique nation. We are more\r\n\r\namenable  to  change things for the better, of  course,  without\r\n\r\ndisrupting  the  lives  of  too  many  people.   In   terms   of\r\n\r\nhealthcare,  I  feel that to further integrate  the  public  and\r\n\r\nprivate  sectors and to have them functioning cohesively,  would\r\n\r\nbe a worthwhile change for our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, let me first commend\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Health for having taken prompt action to  meet\r\n\r\nboth  the  short-term  and anticipated long-term  shortfalls  in\r\n\r\nhealthcare manpower.  I note that the intake of medical students\r\n\r\ninto  NUS was increased from 150 to 180 last year, and  will  be\r\n\r\nfurther  increased to 200 this year, so as to meet the increased\r\n\r\nlong-term demand for doctors as our population grows  older.   I\r\n\r\nalso  note  that our public sector hospitals have been  actively\r\n\r\nrecruiting  foreign-trained  doctors  and  nurses  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsupplement our local supply of healthcare professionals and meet\r\n\r\nthe current shortages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I learn from recent press reports that the\r\n\r\nregional  economic  crisis  has been  taking  its  toll  on  the\r\n\r\nhealthcare institutions.  Private sector hospitals have reported\r\n\r\ndecreases in their occupancy rates.  I have also read of private\r\n\r\nsector  specialists who say that they are seeing  fewer  foreign\r\n\r\npatients now than they used to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the fact that overall the demand for\r\n\r\nhealthcare  services appears to have declined, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister for Health whether his Ministry is rethinking\r\n\r\nits long-term strategy and projections for the supply of doctors\r\n\r\nand nurses in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, will the increase in the local supply of doctors\r\n\r\nand  nurses  result  in an oversupply, in view  of  the  current\r\n\r\neconomic climate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, does the Ministry of Health have any plans to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  foreign intake and recruitment of both doctors  and\r\n\r\nnurses?  If not, foreign doctors and nurses may end up competing\r\n\r\nwith  our local doctors and nurses for work when overall  demand\r\n\r\nfor health care goes down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will clarify these two points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, in the past several years, we have\r\n\r\nseen  an increasing number of specialised medical centres  being\r\n\r\nestablished.   We  have  now  in our midst  the  National  Heart\r\n\r\nCentre, National Eye\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentre,  National Skin Centre, the new KK Women  and  Children's\r\n\r\nHospital,  just  to name a few.  There is logic  in  setting  up\r\n\r\nthese  centres, as they concentrate specialised expertise  under\r\n\r\none roof, which should also help to lead to better treatment and\r\n\r\nfacilitate research.  There are, however, two effects which need\r\n\r\nto  be addressed.  First, how do we reconcile treatment by these\r\n\r\ncentres  and  those  currently done in other general  hospitals?\r\n\r\nWhile we can say, for instance, that the paediatric cases can be\r\n\r\nhandled by the KK Women and Children's Hospital, how do we  deal\r\n\r\nwith  specific paediatric cases which have to be handled in  the\r\n\r\nother  general  hospitals?  The same, for example,  can  go  for\r\n\r\nheart  cases, especially when the patient has multiple illnesses\r\n\r\nand  cannot be wheeled from one hospital to another.  How do  we\r\n\r\nration  the  manpower  required  to  handle  the  treatment   in\r\n\r\ndifferent places?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the standalone facilities with their sparkling new\r\n\r\nfacades  and  very tasteful designs will give an  impression  of\r\n\r\nhigh  cost  treatment.   In  reality, specialist  treatment,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, will cost more.  It will be helpful if the Minister  can\r\n\r\ngive  an  explanation  on this and assure the  public  that  the\r\n\r\ntreatment costs at these centres are fair and reasonable and, if\r\n\r\nhigher,  whether  they  can be justified by  higher  value-added\r\n\r\nservice?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I go on to the next topic?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> On the school health programme, early this\r\n\r\nyear  the GPC for Health visited the Institute of Health,  which\r\n\r\nimplements the school health programme.

I  believe that the school health  programme  is\r\n\r\nlittle   known   to  the  public  outside  the   schools.    The\r\n\r\ncontribution   of   the  staff  involved  should   be   properly\r\n\r\nrecognised.

The major types of health programmes, namely,  health\r\n\r\nscreening,  immunisation programme and health  education  ensure\r\n\r\nthat our school children are well looked after and they grow  up\r\n\r\nto become healthy citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, our school children undergo screening at\r\n\r\nPrimary  1,  Primary 6 and Secondary 4.  These health screenings\r\n\r\nassess  their  nutritional status, their growth and development,\r\n\r\ntheir  vision and any other health problems.  These assessments,\r\n\r\nI  believe,  are very useful, as we can detect early any  health\r\n\r\nproblems  faced  by  our children, and thereafter  we  can  take\r\n\r\nremedial measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister whether the Ministry has any\r\n\r\nplans   to  conduct  yearly  health  screening  for  our  school\r\n\r\nchildren.   If  not, could the Ministry perhaps consider  having\r\n\r\nadditional screening at these Primary 3 and Primary 4 levels and\r\n\r\nalso at Secondary 2.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the health problems amongst children is myopia.\r\n\r\nI  wish  to ask the Minister whether the Ministry has any health\r\n\r\neducation programme to advise our children on myopia  so  as  to\r\n\r\nprevent  more of them becoming myopic.  Further, Sir, I wish  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  whether the School  Health  Service  screens\r\n\r\nstudents  in  our  junior colleges and institutes  of  technical\r\n\r\neducation.  If not, could the programme be extended to them too?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we always say that\r\n\r\nfor  the  nation  to be strong we must have strong  people.   We\r\n\r\nalways  say  children are the future masters of the nation.   We\r\n\r\nall know that we must have a healthy body and a healthy mind  in\r\n\r\norder to get things done in the best possible manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, have we done enough to develop ourselves into\r\n\r\na   nation   of  healthy  people?   This  is  a  big   question,\r\n\r\nparticularly  on  the  health of our children.   Every  year  we\r\n\r\ninvest  a  lot of money on education.  However, are we  spending\r\n\r\nenough on the health of our children?  When I look at our little\r\n\r\nboys  and girls running about in my constituency, many  of  them\r\n\r\nare  chubby  and  cute.  But a few years later, when  they  grow\r\n\r\nolder,   they  have a good chance of turning fat and overweight.\r\n\r\nObese school children seem to be a common sight nowadays.  If we\r\n\r\nare  going  to spend so much money on education, yet  unable  to\r\n\r\ncultivate our children into boys and girls,  then we would  have\r\n\r\nlost the meaning of our total education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that when children are overweight, they are less\r\n\r\nfit,  and  the majority of   overweight children are  not  doing\r\n\r\nwell  in  their  studies.  So we should do something  about  it.\r\n\r\nLooking  after  the  well-being  of  the  children  is  also   a\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the Government.  While giving  them  a  good\r\n\r\nliving  environment, we should likewise  give them strong bodies\r\n\r\nso  that  they could learn and grow up to be useful citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, the Ministry of Health is spending only $11\r\n\r\nmillion on school health services.  Assuming that there are half\r\n\r\na  million school children, we are spending only about  $22  per\r\n\r\nyear  on  each  student.   I feel that this  amount  is  grossly\r\n\r\ninadequate.  So I would like to ask the Minister for Health what\r\n\r\nplans  has the Ministry to ask for more funds for their officers\r\n\r\nto  provide  better preventive health service to  our  students.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  I heard that in many schools, they  are  engaging\r\n\r\nsome  medical  and  physical  education  experts  to  guide  the\r\n\r\nteachers  and  students  on  ways of  healthy  living.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  the  Ministry of Health should help by providing  more\r\n\r\nresources for the schools to improve the general health  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, first, I\r\n\r\nwould like to thank the MPs who have spoken.  On the first  cut,\r\n\r\nfour MPs have spoken on manpower\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupply of doctors and nurses.  Mr Bernard Chen has asked  for  a\r\n\r\nreport on the progress that we have made in meeting the manpower\r\n\r\ntargets,  in terms of supply of doctors and nurses.  And  he  is\r\n\r\nalso  wondering  what  is  theits impact  of  from  the  current\r\n\r\ndownturn  in foreign patient load.  Mr Goh Choon Kang has  asked\r\n\r\nwhat  are the plans for solving the manpower shortages  that  we\r\n\r\nare  facing  in both doctors and nurses.  Dr Lily  Neo  is  also\r\n\r\nworried  about the exodus of doctors and wants to know  what  we\r\n\r\nare  planning to do, whilst Mr Choo Wee Khiang is also concerned\r\n\r\nabout  the  downturn in the economy and impact  on  the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  and what we are doing to reduce the intake  of  foreign\r\n\r\ndoctors and nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are different perceptions from different angles.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to assure Mr Bernard Chen that the steps  that  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  last year in this House for increasing  the  manpower\r\n\r\nsupply  are  being taken.  The first step, of  course,  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant - increasing the intake of medical students from 150 a\r\n\r\nyear  to 180 in the 1997 intake.  But I think it will be also\r\n\r\nuseful for me to briefly recap the four key factors underpinning\r\n\r\nmedium to long-term health manpower projections, because, unless\r\n\r\nwe  keep  these in mind, we will not be able to appreciate  what\r\n\r\nthe Ministry is doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, is that patients' expectations will continue to\r\n\r\nincrease.  Singaporeans are better educated, and they are better\r\n\r\ninformed.  Increasingly, doctors tell the Ministry that patients\r\n\r\nand  their  families insist on being told exactly  what  is  the\r\n\r\ndiagnosis,  what is the treatment being rendered  to  them,  and\r\n\r\nwhat  are the implications of the treatment.  This communication\r\n\r\nprogramme  is a very good one.  But, unfortunately, it  is  also\r\n\r\nvery time-consuming and therefore it will increase the need  for\r\n\r\ndoctors in the years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, aging population. With the number of elderly\r\n\r\nincreasing,  the demand for doctors from the elderly  population\r\n\r\nwill also increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, medical research. This is also related to what Dr\r\n\r\nLily  Neo  has  said.  It is important that  we  focus  also  on\r\n\r\nmedical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresearch  in  our medical institutions.  This will allow  us  to\r\n\r\nremain  at  the forefront of medical development as well  as  to\r\n\r\nensure  that we are able to maintain a high standard of  medical\r\n\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth is, of course, foreign patient load. It has\r\n\r\ngone down now.  But I think once the regional economies recover,\r\n\r\nthe foreign patient load will also rebound.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first three factors are definitely not affected by\r\n\r\nthe downturn and, therefore, we should continue with our present\r\n\r\nprogramme to increase the supply of doctors.  The impact of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  turmoil, in fact, in terms of the Ministry's  manpower\r\n\r\nsupply,  has  in  fact  been  positive.   The  resignations   of\r\n\r\nspecialists from the Government hospitals has, in fact, declined\r\n\r\nslightly.   For example, last year, in February and  March,  the\r\n\r\ntwo  months, we lost a total of 14 specialists.  This year,  for\r\n\r\nthe first two months, that loss has been reduced to eight.  So I\r\n\r\nthink the trend is quite encouraging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of actual plans to address the shortfall, whichat\r\n\r\nMr Goh Choon Kang has asked for, I would like to break this into\r\n\r\nthree different categories which are very important: the medical\r\n\r\nofficers (MOs), the specialists, and the nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For MOs, last year, I announced the improvement in terms of\r\n\r\nservice.   We  have  implemented that.  We have  adjusted  their\r\n\r\nsalaries,  we  have  adjusted their pay scales.   We  have  also\r\n\r\nimproved the work environment.  Last year, I mentioned about the\r\n\r\nnight  calls being very onerous.  We have reduced the number  of\r\n\r\nnight calls from between eight and 10, to six now.  So it  is  a\r\n\r\nsignificant reduction.  Furthermore, we have also tried to match\r\n\r\nthe  postings of the medical officers with their interests.   So\r\n\r\nif  a person would prefers to work normal office hours, then  we\r\n\r\ntry to make sure that the person is posted to a polyclinic which\r\n\r\noperates  during the normal office hours.  If  a  person  has  a\r\n\r\ncertain  interest in, let us say, the elderly, then we also  try\r\n\r\nto  make sure that we are able to give the postings that fit  in\r\n\r\nwith  that particular doctor's interest.  And I believe that  if\r\n\r\nwe can do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  better, it is not always possible to match perfectly,  but\r\n\r\nif  we  can  improve on the matching, then I think the long-term\r\n\r\nability  to make the job more interesting for the MOs  concerned\r\n\r\nwould  be  there, and therefore the long-term ability to  retain\r\n\r\nthem  would also be there.  Of course, we are recruiting  talent\r\n\r\nfrom abroad.  The healthcare sector in that respect is following\r\n\r\nwhat  the other sectors of the economy have had to do -  recruit\r\n\r\ntalent from abroad.  And I must say that the recruitment results\r\n\r\nhave been encouraging.  We embarked on that last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to inform the House that last year alone we\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  bring  back  and recruit a  total  of  160  medical\r\n\r\nofficers and housemen.  In previous years, we were only able  to\r\n\r\nget  about 50 a year.  So last year, with the concerted efforts,\r\n\r\nwe  have  tripled the results.  I do not think we  can  maintain\r\n\r\nthis  level,  because what we did was in reaching out.   We  are\r\n\r\nalso  able to reach out to Singaporeans who were already working\r\n\r\nabroad  and  therefore  we brought them back.   That  pool  will\r\n\r\ndwindle in years to come.  What is also interesting is that one-quarter  of the 160 are non-Singaporeans.  So, in fact, we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  able to widen our talent pool.  And as a result,  we  have\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  reduce the shortfall in the medical officers.   The\r\n\r\nshortfall now is a very manageable 61.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to encourage Singaporean doctors to\r\n\r\nreturn.   We  will continue to have regular dialogues  with  our\r\n\r\nmedical officers to understand what interests them and help them\r\n\r\nto  do  their  career planning.  And I believe  that  with  this\r\n\r\nconcerted effort, we will be able to continue holding on to more\r\n\r\nMOs  and  therefore  reduce the shortfall in the  coming  years.\r\n\r\nOnce  we  are able to do that, then I think the problem that  Mr\r\n\r\nGoh Choon Kang brought up just now, that in the polyclinics that\r\n\r\nhe  visited, with a planned manpower of 12 doctors, we were only\r\n\r\nable  to supply seven - .  I think if we are able to hold on  to\r\n\r\nmore  MOs, we would be able to ensure that the polyclinics  will\r\n\r\nbe fully manned in the next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialists - this is a very crucial group, because\r\n\r\nspecialists do not only provide service but, as pointed out by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr  Lily  Neo, the senior specialists are also teachers  of  our\r\n\r\nfuture  generation of doctors.  Therefore, it is important  that\r\n\r\nwe try to retain the better ones of the senior specialists.  But\r\n\r\nhaving said that, I want to also ask the House to remember  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  always be a turnover of doctors and specialists  in\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals  because  if we have, let  us  say,  200  doctors\r\n\r\ngraduating  each year, and we train half of them as specialists,\r\n\r\nit  is not possible for our public sector to retain all the 100.\r\n\r\nSo it is good, in fact, to have some turnover to ensure that the\r\n\r\npublic sector is not bloated and also to ensure that the private\r\n\r\nsector is not stifled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector, as at the end of 1997, is still short of\r\n\r\n70  specialists.   The figure is an improvement  over  the  year\r\n\r\nbefore.   At  the  end  of  1996,  we  had  a  shortage  of   84\r\n\r\nspecialists.   We were short of 84 specialists.   So  it  is  an\r\n\r\nimprovement.  And, again, the existing shortage is mainly in two\r\n\r\nareas -  anesthesia and diagnostic radiology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a short-term measure, we are asking the restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals to continue recruiting from abroad to make up for  the\r\n\r\nshortfall.   And we are also reaching out very actively  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  to  encourage those who are practising  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  to  devote  some  time  in  the  public  sector\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  do  some service, conduct some teaching,  and  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  interested in research, we are  also  very  happy  to\r\n\r\ninvolve them in our research activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of retention, it is not possible for the public\r\n\r\nsector to pay the same amount as what private sector specialists\r\n\r\ncan earn.  In fact, we have not paid close to what they are able\r\n\r\nto  earn  in  the private sector.  But because of  the  need  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the better ones are retained, it is important  for\r\n\r\nour payment system to ensure that our leading lights are able to\r\n\r\nearn  more  and that the gap between what they can  earn  versus\r\n\r\nwhat  they can potentially earn, if they went out to the private\r\n\r\nsector,  will be closed or reduced.  This is something  that  we\r\n\r\nare looking at very actively now and I think we should be seeing\r\n\r\nsome change in the coming months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the overall environment, it is something that we\r\n\r\nare  also  looking  at  actively - how to  make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nteaching  is more meaningful, more satisfying, and also  how  to\r\n\r\nensure  that we have adequate research funds for them.   Because\r\n\r\nat  the end of the day, this is what distinguishes institutional\r\n\r\npractice  from  private sector practice - the teaching  and  the\r\n\r\nresearch.   In  terms of research, we are now  making  available\r\n\r\nmore funding for research and we are asking the hospitals to set\r\n\r\naside  protected time to enable those doctors who are interested\r\n\r\nin doing research to actually conduct the research work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that with all this, we would be able to better\r\n\r\nretain  an adequate number of specialists to serve in the public\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nurses - the shortfall is still very significant,\r\n\r\nunfortunately.   Last year, we managed to increase  our  nursing\r\n\r\nmanpower   by  400.   But,  unfortunately,  the  shortfall   has\r\n\r\nincreased from 6% to 8%.  And this is because the opening of the\r\n\r\nKandang  Kerbau (KK) Women and Children's Hospital and  the  New\r\n\r\nChangi Hospital have resulted in an increased demand for nurses.\r\n\r\nWe  have opened more wards and therefore the two hospitals  have\r\n\r\nhad to recruit more nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national shortfall in nurses is expected to be about\r\n\r\n1,300  between  now and the year 2000.  What  are  we  doing  to\r\n\r\nresolve  this  problem which has been with us for a  long  time?\r\n\r\nSir, first, we are intensifying efforts to promote nursing as  a\r\n\r\ncareer  of choice.  As you all know, there are tremendous career\r\n\r\nopportunities  available now to our young girls  and  boys,  and\r\n\r\nnursing will have to make a strong bid for their attention and a\r\n\r\nstrong bid for their decision.  So we are doing career talks and\r\n\r\nexhibitions.  And I think the results over the past  two  years,\r\n\r\nin  terms of enrolment in the diploma course in the polytechnic,\r\n\r\nhad been encouraging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also recruiting from abroad for the time being. It\r\n\r\nis  very  essential.  Because it takes three years  to  train  a\r\n\r\nnurse.  Shortage is with us now.  Service is being affected.  We\r\n\r\nneed to recruit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogressively.   And  last year, in 1997,  we  had  one  of  our\r\n\r\nbiggest  recruitment drives.  We managed to recruit  800  nurses\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad.  They mostly come from the Philippines, India and,\r\n\r\nto a small extent, China.\r\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the longer term, we are also looking at the\r\n\r\nfundamentals.   To  achieve that, we  are  now  carrying  out  a\r\n\r\nstrategic  review of the nursing profession.  The  objective  is\r\n\r\nhow  to  make the profession, as a whole, more attractive,  more\r\n\r\nchallenging,  more satisfying.  We have set up a task  force  in\r\n\r\nNovember 1997 to look into this and we expect the task force  to\r\n\r\ncomplete its work by the end of May.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the next cut by Mr Bernard Chen.\r\n\r\nHe  asked  how  do  we reconcile the treatment in  the  national\r\n\r\ncentres versus other hospitals and his concern as to whether the\r\n\r\nmedical  centres  will  in  fact  result  in  higher  costs  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  higher fees for patients.  Sir, in order  to  discuss\r\n\r\nthe  first point on how we reconcile the treatment, let me first\r\n\r\nexplain  that the national centres are not meant to replace  the\r\n\r\nexisting departments in each of the hospitals, for example,  the\r\n\r\nNational  Heart Centre.  The National Heart Centre will  coexist\r\n\r\nwith  the  Heart  Department in NUH and  in  fact  will  provide\r\n\r\nsupport  to the other hospitals, in terms of providing expertise\r\n\r\nand working with them on their patients who have heart problems.\r\n\r\nFor most cases, because Singapore is very compact, the existence\r\n\r\nof  a  national  centre will not impact on  the  safety  of  the\r\n\r\npatient.   Let us say a patient has a very serious heart  attack\r\n\r\nand requires a bypass.  Because Singapore is so small, even if a\r\n\r\nperson is staying in the eastern part of Singapore, it will only\r\n\r\ntake  about  20 minutes to go by the highway.  In the  meantime,\r\n\r\nthe  paramedics would be able to stabilise the patient.  And  if\r\n\r\nthe  patient  decides to go to, let us say, New Changi  Hospital\r\n\r\nwhich  should be the nearest, the hospital staff there would  be\r\n\r\nable  to stabilise him and get ready for a bypass operation,  if\r\n\r\nneed be, in the Singapore General Hospital or NUH.  So\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  centres  will coexist.  But more importantly,  the  centres\r\n\r\nwill allow us to optimise the use of our limited resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, having a small population, also implies that the\r\n\r\nrarer and more complex cases would be fewer.  Rather than having\r\n\r\nthese  rarer  and complex cases split over several  centres  and\r\n\r\neach  centre not having enough of the critical mass  to  develop\r\n\r\nthe  expertise,  what  we will do is we  will  now  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncoordinate  and ensure that these more complex and  rarer  cases\r\n\r\nare  centralised in one centre so that the chances of developing\r\n\r\nin-depth  skills  will be better improved.   What  we  are  also\r\n\r\ndoing  is  that  we  are  reaching out  to  the  private  sector\r\n\r\npractitioners  as well as practitioners in other  hospitals  and\r\n\r\nencouraging  them to come forward and be dual- appointed.   This\r\n\r\nmeans  they can have their appointments where they are but  also\r\n\r\nreceive another appointment at the national centre so that those\r\n\r\nwho  are  interested and have some expertise in  treating  those\r\n\r\nmore complex cases can also now come to the national centre  and\r\n\r\nhave the advantage of a bigger patient load.  So it is a win-win\r\n\r\nsituation  for  both the specialists involved  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\npatients  who  have such conditions.  Also,  it  will  help  the\r\n\r\nprofession  greatly.  Because by having the leading  specialists\r\n\r\nbeing  affiliated to the centre, we will also be able to upgrade\r\n\r\nthe  standing of the profession as well as better facilitate and\r\n\r\ncoordinate  the development programmes for that  specialty.   It\r\n\r\nwould  also  enable us to come out with, what you call  clinical\r\n\r\npathways,  ie, for certain complex conditions as well  as  other\r\n\r\ncommonly encountered medical conditions, a guideline on how that\r\n\r\ncondition  should  be best treated.  In this way,  the  patients\r\n\r\nwill get the best possible treatment and hopefully the most cost\r\n\r\neffective as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the centres result in more costly treatment? Sir, the\r\n\r\nanswer  is no, because already at the present moment,  the  fees\r\n\r\ncharged  in these centres are exactly the same as those  charged\r\n\r\nin  the  other restructured hospitals.  But of course  sometimes\r\n\r\nthe  perception could be that the patient goes in and  the  bill\r\n\r\nsize is a lot bigger.  But that is because patients going to the\r\n\r\nnationalmedical centres tend to be patients\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith   more  complicated  conditions  and  therefore  they   are\r\n\r\nsubjected  to more tests and the result is a higher  bill  size.\r\n\r\nBut  the  point  is  that  if  they  had  gone  to  an  existing\r\n\r\ndepartment,  the  same  tests would  probably  have  had  to  be\r\n\r\nconducted.  So in terms of costs, the answer is no.  If you  are\r\n\r\nable  to now consolidate the pool of expertise and come out with\r\n\r\nmore cost effective treatment protocols, over the long term,  we\r\n\r\nshould be able to see a better control on our healthcare costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to ask my Senior Minister of State to\r\n\r\nreply to the last part.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b>\r\n\r\nI  would like to thank Mr Bernard Chen, Mr Ibrahim Othman and Mr\r\n\r\nChoo  Wee  Khiang  for  their  interest  in  the  school  health\r\n\r\nprogramme.   As Mr Bernard Chen said, this part of the  work  of\r\n\r\nthe  MOH is not very well known.  In fact, thisits work has been\r\n\r\nvery much taken for granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school health programme is one of the strategies to\r\n\r\nachieve our Ministry's mission to promote good health and reduce\r\n\r\nillness.   The health promotion and preventive health programmes\r\n\r\nreach out to children when they are young and they help to lay a\r\n\r\nfirm  foundation  for good health.  This would  bring  long-term\r\n\r\nbenefits  to  the population.  MOH will continue to place  great\r\n\r\nemphasis on such programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School Health Service (SHS) reaches out to about half a\r\n\r\nmillion  students in our primary and secondary  schools,  junior\r\n\r\ncolleges,   Institutes  of  Technical  Education  and   Sspecial\r\n\r\nSschools.   Mr  Ibrahim Othman asked whether the  School  Health\r\n\r\nService  covers the junior colleges and ITE.  My answer is  yes.\r\n\r\nThey  are  already included in our programme.  The SHS  provides\r\n\r\nthree  major types of health programmes for the students: health\r\n\r\nscreening and follow-up care, immunisation, and health promotion\r\n\r\nand education.  These programmes are conducted in the schools by\r\n\r\nvisiting  school  health  teams and are  also  provided  at  the\r\n\r\nStudent Health Centre at the Institute of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health screening. A full medical examination is given to\r\n\r\nour  students at Primary 1, Primary 6 and Secondary 4, as  noted\r\n\r\nby  Mr Ibrahim Othman also.  They are given to students at these\r\n\r\nlevels  by  doctors  and  nurses who  assess  their  nutritional\r\n\r\nstatus,  that  is,  to  see  whether  they  are  overweight   or\r\n\r\nunderweight,  to see whether they are growing and developing  at\r\n\r\nthe  appropriate  pace, to check on their eyesight  and  on  any\r\n\r\nother  health  problems.  In addition, Primary 1  students  also\r\n\r\nundergo  hearing tests.  Primary 4 students are given  a  spinal\r\n\r\nscreening in order to exclude a curved spine and students at all\r\n\r\nthe  levels  are  given an annual vision  test.   These  medical\r\n\r\nexaminations and screenings are given at important stages of the\r\n\r\nchild's development.  It is not necessary to give a full medical\r\n\r\nscreening  every  year.   This is the  opinion  of  the  medical\r\n\r\nprofession.   Students who are identified with  health  problems\r\n\r\nare referred to the Student Health Centre for further assessment\r\n\r\nand follow-up management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Student Health Centre, there are clinics for\r\n\r\nstudents  with  nutrition and weight problems, eye  and  hearing\r\n\r\nproblems, growth and development and adolescent problems as well\r\n\r\nas  heart and spine conditions.  Visiting specialists to the SHS\r\n\r\nwill  attend  to  the  more complex cases.   If  students  still\r\n\r\nrequire  further assessment and management by specialists,  they\r\n\r\nare  referred to the appropriate hospital department.  After the\r\n\r\nhealth screening, feedback is given to the schools.  So if there\r\n\r\nare certain students in the school who require special attention\r\n\r\nor  exemption from some school activities, such as PE, then  the\r\n\r\nprincipal would be notified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immunisation. The school health teams visiting the schools\r\n\r\nadminister immunisations against the major communicable diseases\r\n\r\nincluding  diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles,  mumps,  rubella\r\n\r\nand  tuberculosis, according to the Childhood Immunisation\r\n\r\nSchedule.  About 95% of the students are covered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health promotion and education. The School Health Service\r\n\r\nalso carries out a lot of health education activities on leading\r\n\r\na healthy lifestyle, on eye care,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersonal hygiene and other topics.  The school health teams work\r\n\r\nwith  the  schools in health promoting activities, such  as  the\r\n\r\nschool  environment,  canteen or tuckshop  and  also  on  parent\r\n\r\neducation.   For  some  years now, MOH  has  also  assisted  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education to incorporate health education into  the\r\n\r\nschool curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our students are generally healthy. The school health\r\n\r\nprogramme  has  greatly  contributed  to  this  happy  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs.  However, among our school children, myopia and obesity\r\n\r\nare  still common health problems.  In fact, in 1997, about  48%\r\n\r\nof  the  students have shortsightedness and 12% of the  students\r\n\r\nare  assessed to be overweight.  What do we do about  this?   We\r\n\r\neducate  the students, the parents, the teachers and the  public\r\n\r\non  these two health problems.  Our strategy for control  is  to\r\n\r\nprevent,  detect  and  also correct the problems  at  the  early\r\n\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For myopia, MOH has set up a Vision Care Committee and this\r\n\r\nCommittee has drawn up guidelines on measures that can be  taken\r\n\r\nby  various organisations to prevent myopia.  And based on  this\r\n\r\nCommittee's  guidelines,  MOE has embarked  on  a  programme  to\r\n\r\nensure  better lighting in the classrooms.  All primary  schools\r\n\r\nhave  also introduced the eye relaxation programme and  this  is\r\n\r\nbeing extended to the secondary schools as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for obesity, MOE, as you may be aware, has for a number\r\n\r\nof  years  implemented the Trim and Fit scheme which  emphasises\r\n\r\nphysical  activities and proper nutrition.   Within  the  school\r\n\r\nhealth service itself, we have now a Nutrition Clinic which runs\r\n\r\na  structured obesity management programme for students who  are\r\n\r\nmoderately  or severely overweight.  We also plan to conduct  an\r\n\r\neducation programme for parents of moderately and severely obese\r\n\r\nchildren  because,  very  often, the parents  themselves  pamper\r\n\r\ntheir  children.  They are not necessarily convinced and  during\r\n\r\nschool holidays, they feed them with all kinds of junk food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs  a  result, children will come back to school gaining  weight\r\n\r\nagain.  So we are trying to educate the parents also.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SHS is able to do all these programmes and keep our\r\n\r\nschool  children  healthy at a budget of $11  million  per  year\r\n\r\nthrough careful planning and efficient scheduling of activities.\r\n\r\nIn  health  care,  more spending does not necessarily  equal  to\r\n\r\nbetter  care  or better outcome.  In fact, I think for  $22  per\r\n\r\npupil, we have done so many marvellous things.  We will continue\r\n\r\nto  maximise  our resources and study ways of providing  a  high\r\n\r\nstandard  of  preventive health care for our students.   We  may\r\n\r\nalso consider extending such health promoting activities to  the\r\n\r\npre-school  age group because some of the health  problems  like\r\n\r\nmyopia and obesity also affect them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> I am assured by the Minister's remark\r\n\r\nabout  the  need for continued facilities in the  hospitals  for\r\n\r\nspecialised  treatment.   But in our visits  to  the  hospitals,\r\n\r\nthere was some concern expressed that too much emphasis would be\r\n\r\nplaced  on  the  centres,  and hospitals  like  the  New  Changi\r\n\r\nHospital  or the upcoming Tan Tock Seng Hospital would  give  up\r\n\r\nthese  traditional specialised facilities.  I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  look into making sure that everyone gets a fair  share  of\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of obesity, I understand that in some\r\n\r\nschools,  school  children have been asked  to  forgo  food  and\r\n\r\ndrinks during recess time.  Instead of having a bowl of noodles,\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  exercise.  Apparently, some parents  are  a  bit\r\n\r\nanxious  that  their lovely children are prevented  from  having\r\n\r\ntheir  bowl of soup or noodles.  I do not know whether  this  is\r\n\r\nthe  right  way  to go about things.  Maybe that is  better  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is  a brain drain problem in  terms  of  foreign\r\n\r\nrecruited doctors and nurses.  Is there an contractual agreement\r\n\r\nbetween ourselves and the foreign recruited doctors?  Because  I\r\n\r\nam  worried  that after having a short stint in Singapore,  they\r\n\r\nlearn a lot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom our medical services and then leave somewhere for good.   I\r\n\r\nam actually concerned about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, are there records to show that foreign recruited\r\n\r\ndoctors have left after a short stint of service in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards obesity, I wonder whether the Minister will\r\n\r\nconsider sending  booklets on obesity  to hawkers and fast  food\r\n\r\noperators to tell them what have they done to our young  people.\r\n\r\nTwelve out of 100 is actually a very serious thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I think the  earlier\r\n\r\nremark made was that we recruited 160 doctors in our recruitment\r\n\r\ndrive  overseas, of whom a substantial number were Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nWill  the  Minister please clarify on the number of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  qualified  as  doctors from overseas?   How  many  of  them\r\n\r\nactually failed to gain admission to our local university in the\r\n\r\nfirst place?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, first, on the point brought up by\r\n\r\nMr  Bernard  Chen that some of the hospitals are concerned  that\r\n\r\ntheir  traditional  specialist areas may be jeopardised.   There\r\n\r\nare two different types of acute hospitals.  One is the tertiary\r\n\r\nhospitals  which would be mainly SGH and NUH, where  we  have  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  number of specialties available in those  hospitals\r\n\r\nplus  super  specialisation.  And  we  also  have  the  regional\r\n\r\nhospitals which reach out to the broad general public.  The aim,\r\n\r\nas has been spelt out in the 1993 White Paper on Health Care, is\r\n\r\nthat  in  view  of  our compact size and in view  of  our  small\r\n\r\nmanpower  and  patient pool, it is important for  us  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat, on the one hand, we do not over provide; and, on the other\r\n\r\nhand,  have  such a dispersion of specialties that each  of  the\r\n\r\ndepartments  now  ends  up  with  a  sub-optimal  patient  load.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the regional hospitals, like New Changi Hospital, Tan\r\n\r\nTock Seng Hospital and, Alexandra Hospital, will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  have general departments of medicine and  surgery,\r\n\r\nand  they will also continue to have an ability to focus on one,\r\n\r\ntwo or three specialties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not mean that they are going to stagnate there,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  population profile would  change  over  time  and,\r\n\r\ntogether with that, the change in the medical condition and  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  medical  care.  For example,  heart.    New  Changi\r\n\r\nHospital (NCH), at the moment, does not have a heart department,\r\n\r\nbecause in terms of the present supply of service, both SGH  and\r\n\r\nNUH,  together with the private sector hospitals, are  adequate.\r\n\r\nBut  we  are  prepared to let the National  Heart  Centre  (NHC)\r\n\r\nprovide  some supporting services in NCH and allow NCH  also  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  some  service up to a certain level of complexity,  ie,\r\n\r\ncheck-ups, perhaps even some interventional work, but definitely\r\n\r\nnot  by-pass operation.  So we have to balance, on one hand, the\r\n\r\naspirations  of  the doctors and hospitals; and,  on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, we have to balance against the national interest, which is\r\n\r\nhow  to  make  sure that we do not unnecessarily duplicate  both\r\n\r\nexpertise and equipment which are very expensive.  So  it  is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing balancing game that we have to play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Choo Wee Khiang asked about the brain drain, whether we\r\n\r\nhave  a contractual agreement and are we seeing a lot of foreign\r\n\r\ndoctors leaving.  Is he talking of bond-breakers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards contractual agreements, I believe most of the\r\n\r\ndoctors  are recruited here and offered contracts over a certain\r\n\r\nnumber  of  years.  So there are normally contractual agreements\r\n\r\nbinding them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we worry about the brain drain? I think it is a\r\n\r\ntoss up.  If we are worried about the brain drain and we do  not\r\n\r\ngo  out to recruit foreign doctors, then we end up with an  ever\r\n\r\nbigger  shortage here, which must impact on the quality of  care\r\n\r\nand  result  in long waiting queues of patients.  Our experience\r\n\r\nhas  been that most of the foreign-trained doctors do sink their\r\n\r\nroots  here after a few years, because the practice of  medicine\r\n\r\nis a very personal thing.  After practising here for a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfew  years,  they  develop close links with a certain  group  of\r\n\r\npatients  and  it does not make sense to give up  that  goodwill\r\n\r\nwhich  they  have built up over the years.  So many of  them  do\r\n\r\nsink roots and settle down here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has asked about the 160 doctors that we\r\n\r\nrecruited  last year.  Three-quarters of them are  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThat means 120 are Singaporeans.  As regards whether we know how\r\n\r\nmany of them were trained abroad because they could not get into\r\n\r\nNUS, unfortunately, I do not have the information.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, can I make one clarification? Can the\r\n\r\nMinister tell us whether the hospital doctors are now given  the\r\n\r\ncorrect recognition and time to do research and teaching?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I just like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  how  many of the 160 doctors who were  recruited  were\r\n\r\nfrom the approved list of medical schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in response to Dr Lily Neo's\r\n\r\nquestion,  whether  our senior doctors are  given  adequate  R&D\r\n\r\ntime,  unfortunately, since R&D has not been a  major  focus  in\r\n\r\nprevious years, we were unable to give protected time to many of\r\n\r\nthose  who  were  interested in research.  Our plan  now  is  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  that research is an important pillar of institutional\r\n\r\npractice  and therefore we would ensure that funds are available\r\n\r\nto  enable those who are really interested in research  to  have\r\n\r\nenough protected time to conduct research and enough funding  to\r\n\r\nemploy  supporting  staff to help him or  her  in  the  research\r\n\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock asked whether the 160 doctors recruited\r\n\r\nlast  year  are  from the recognised medical schools.   The  new\r\n\r\nschedule  was  effective end-1993.  So anyone  who  enrolled  in\r\n\r\nthose  medical schools before end-1993 will still qualify. Since\r\n\r\nthis  is  1998, and they were recruited in 1997, I  assume  that\r\n\r\nthey had enrolled in the medical schools under the old schedule,\r\n\r\nbefore the new deadline took effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.10 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, if we are so short of doctors,\r\n\r\nwould the Ministry then consider expanding the approved list  of\r\n\r\nmedical schools, so that we can have a bigger intake of doctors?\r\n\r\nThe  present  list is quite narrow.

Our preliminary  findings\r\n\r\nare  that, in the first two years alone, since the new  schedule\r\n\r\ntook  effect,  the  approved medical schools have  already  been\r\n\r\ntaking  in about 50 students a year.  Our expectation  would  be\r\n\r\nthat in the coming years, the enrolment of Singapore students in\r\n\r\nthose  schools  is  likely  to pick  up.   And,  therefore,  the\r\n\r\nenrolment  will  actually exceed what we have projected  in  our\r\n\r\nmanpower planning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have already proceeded to increase the\r\n\r\nintake in NUS; the 180 this year which will be increased to  200\r\n\r\nthis  year.  And if the need arises, we will be quite  happy  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  with  NUS on the possibility of increasing  the  intake\r\n\r\nfurther.

Lim (Aljunied):</b> Sir, may I ask a follow-up\r\n\r\nquestion  on  the specialisation of hospitals?  The  New  Changi\r\n\r\nHospital  when  it  was  built, I think  it  had  provision  for\r\n\r\npaediatric facilities.  As I understand it, these are not  going\r\n\r\nto be used for the time being, but they would be concentrated at\r\n\r\nthe new Kandang Kerbau Hospital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of paediatrics, I can understand if a child has\r\n\r\na hole in the heart that having a specialised team might provide\r\n\r\nbetter  care.  But if a child falls down and breaks a  bone  and\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be  hospitalised, having a  hospital  nearer  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  may be more convenient to the parents.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto ask the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he  would consider allowing  some  paediatric\r\n\r\nfacilities  still at New Changi Hospital, because it will  serve\r\n\r\nthe catchment out in the eastern part of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to seek clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the Minister.  Foreign-trained doctors actually come  from\r\n\r\nthe  recognised  institutions.  But I do not think  nurses  fall\r\n\r\nunder this category because we recruit nurses from all over  the\r\n\r\nworld.  I just wonder whether, as a result of recruiting so many\r\n\r\nnurses from overseas, our service standards will be affected  or\r\n\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, Mr David Lim asked whether we could\r\n\r\nconsider allowing NCH to have a department of paediatrics.  As I\r\n\r\nmentioned  just now, Singapore is an extremely compact  country.\r\n\r\nOn  the  PIE, from one end of Singapore to the other,  it  takes\r\n\r\nabout  45  minutes.  I think now with the road  expansion  works\r\n\r\nthat are going on, once they are completed, the travel time  may\r\n\r\nbe even shorter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern here is that, as I have stated, how do we make\r\n\r\nsure  that  we  do not end up dissipating our limited  resources\r\n\r\nwith  a  balance?   When NCH was planned, it  was  very  clearly\r\n\r\npointed out to the hospital that the existing Toa Payoh Hospital\r\n\r\ndepartments will be transferred to the New Changi Hospital,  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  development  of  new  departments  there,  especially\r\n\r\ndepartments  of  specialties, will have to be  approved  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.   This  is  because  if,  left  to  themselves,  every\r\n\r\nhospital  will  want  to  have  the  whole  complete  range   of\r\n\r\nspecialties plus, if you have that piece of equipment, they will\r\n\r\nsay,  \"I better have one too.\"  That is the surest formula to  a\r\n\r\nhigh  cost type of healthcare system.  We have learnt  from  the\r\n\r\nother  countries how to avoid that and how to ensure that  there\r\n\r\nis  enough  central  control on development  while  giving  each\r\n\r\nhospital maximum flexibility and autonomy to operate efficiently\r\n\r\nwithin their areas of purview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of paediatrics, it is an on-going request\r\n\r\nfrom NCH.  Our reply to NCH is, \"Let the consolidation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npaediatrics in the new KK Hospital be completed first.\"  If need\r\n\r\nbe,  once  KK  Hospital has settled down, I am sure KK  Hospital\r\n\r\nwill be very happy to provide a satellite operation in NCH.   So\r\n\r\nin due course that will be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for nurses, because of the large number of foreign\r\n\r\nnurses  here, as I have stated just now, 12% are foreign nurses.\r\n\r\nHas  the  large  number of foreign nurses here  jeopardised  our\r\n\r\nservice  standards?  I would like to assure Mr Choo  Wee  Khiang\r\n\r\nthat the Singapore Nursing Board takes a very cautious approach.\r\n\r\nBefore  we  embarked  on  a recruitment of  foreign  nurses,  we\r\n\r\nconsulted the professionals oin the Board and they came out with\r\n\r\ntheir  conditions and standards.  Not only that, they also  went\r\n\r\nto  the key countries of recruitment to get acquainted with  the\r\n\r\nkey  teaching institutions so that they understand what are  the\r\n\r\nmethodologies, the curriculum and, more importantly, the  actual\r\n\r\npractice  of  teaching  what is claimed   in  that  nice  little\r\n\r\nbooklet  which  all  institutions give out.   So  we  have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough the quality audits.  Not only that, when the nurses come\r\n\r\nto  Singapore, we counsel them. The Singapore Nursing Board also\r\n\r\nconducts a test on their competency and, quite often, this takes\r\n\r\nthe  form  of  a written test.  So there are a lot of  stringent\r\n\r\nrequirements  in place already to ensure that our high  standard\r\n\r\nof medical care is not in any way compromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I think what Mr David Lim wants is\r\n\r\nan  assurance from the Minister that in the case of a paediatric\r\n\r\nemergency, could the New Changi Hospital at least take  care  of\r\n\r\nthat patient for just that emergency period and later you can do\r\n\r\nthe transfer?  I think he must give the Singaporeans staying  in\r\n\r\nthat area the assurance that in such an emergency, a hospital of\r\n\r\nthat  size  must at least be able to take care of that  sort  of\r\n\r\nemergency,  and not let the poor fellow run all the  way  to  KK\r\n\r\nHospital.  Am I right, Mr David Lim?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> May I add on a word or two first. I thank Dr\r\n\r\nTan  for speaking on my behalf.  I am not a doctor, so I do  not\r\n\r\nknow this matter as well as he does.  Actually, I take it from a\r\n\r\nmore practical point of view.

Although Singapore is  small\r\n\r\nand  it takes 20 minutes to get from Simei, where the New Changi\r\n\r\nHospital is, down to KK Hospital by car, it takes much longer by\r\n\r\npublic  transport. It is much more difficult for  young  parents\r\n\r\nwho may have other toddlers to tag along to make that trip.   So\r\n\r\nit  is  just  to  serve the community better  and  not  for  the\r\n\r\nhospital  administrators, not so that the hospital can have  one\r\n\r\nmore  feather in its cap, but more for the benefit of the people\r\n\r\nwho live out in the east.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, let me respond to the two points.\r\n\r\nDr  Tan  was speaking on behalf of Mr David Lim.  I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  I  should reply to Dr Tan or Mr Lim.  Let me assure  Dr\r\n\r\nTan  that  all  emergency cases are stabilised in the  receiving\r\n\r\nhospital  before they are transferred to the hospital  with  the\r\n\r\nrelevant expertise, whether it is paediatrics, a head injury  or\r\n\r\na heart condition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned to Mr David Lim, this will be done in\r\n\r\ndue course.  Give KK Hospital a chance to consolidate what it is\r\n\r\ndoing.   I  am sure that the CEO and the doctors of KK  Hospital\r\n\r\nwill be very happy to spread their wings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in 1993, we set up\r\n\r\nMedifund.   To  the  poor  people it is a  very  important  fund\r\n\r\nbecause people who really cannot afford the medical fees will be\r\n\r\nable  to  apply  for grants from this Medifund.  The  fund  also\r\n\r\nensures that no citizen in Singapore will be deprived of medical\r\n\r\ncare just because he cannot afford to pay for the medical fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, there were over 40,000 applicants. In 1996, there\r\n\r\nwere  56,000  applicants.  Last year there were  around  50,000.\r\n\r\nFunding  from Medifund came to about $10 million.  According  to\r\n\r\nthe statistics, more than 90% of the applications were approved.\r\n\r\nBut  I  understand that many citizens still do not know  of  the\r\n\r\nexistence of Medifund, or they do not know how to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo  about applying for the fund.  Many of them approached  their\r\n\r\nMPs  for assistance.  Generally, all the PAP  MPs  know  how  to\r\n\r\nassist them.  I am not sure about the Opposition Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, these people can apply directly to the hospitals.\r\n\r\nThey  can  also apply for Medifund through the CDC.  I hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can step up the publicity on Medifund for the benefit\r\n\r\nof the ordinary citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing I want to point out is that since 1993 the\r\n\r\nGovernment has already injected $600 million capital grants into\r\n\r\nMedifund.  Because the fund is financed from the interest earned\r\n\r\nfrom  the  capital grant, the capital will not be used  up.   In\r\n\r\n1993,  it  was $200 million, and from 1994 onwards it  was  $100\r\n\r\nmillion per year, making a total of $600 million.  This year, no\r\n\r\ngrant  is provided because of financial difficultiesturmoil  and\r\n\r\neconomic slowdown.  I hope the Minister can give us an assurance\r\n\r\nthat  in  future years when the economy improves,  the  Medifund\r\n\r\nwill continue to be topped up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the Medical Endowment Fund or\r\n\r\nMedifund  is  an  endowment fund set up in  1993.   The  initial\r\n\r\ncontribution  of $200 million was made by the Government,  after\r\n\r\nwhich an additional $100 million was added to the endowment fund\r\n\r\nby  the  Government  for each of the following  three  financial\r\n\r\nyears,  bringing the total endowment fund to $500  million.  The\r\n\r\npurpose of the Medifund, Sir, is to assist needy Singaporeans to\r\n\r\npay for medical care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Medifund is the most obvious expression of the\r\n\r\npromise  by the  Government that no Singaporean will be deprived\r\n\r\nof healthcare for lack of financial means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note from the latest annual report of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Health that there were about 58,000 applications for Medifund\r\n\r\nassistance  and of which 99.4% were approved.  The total  amount\r\n\r\nof  Medifund help given amounted to $12.4 million.  Unless I  am\r\n\r\nwrong,  most  of  the applications for Medifund assistance  came\r\n\r\nthrough  screenings carried out by hospital social workers.   If\r\n\r\ntrue, some measure of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscreening  would already have been carried out  by  the  medical\r\n\r\nsocial worker and the figure of 0.6% of the applicants who  were\r\n\r\nunsuccessful may be higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister is whether medical social\r\n\r\nworkers  at hospitals screen potential applications before  they\r\n\r\napply  for Medifund assistance.  If so, whether there were  many\r\n\r\npotential  applicants who were turned away at that  stage,  with\r\n\r\nthe result that there could be a  higher figure than the 0.6% as\r\n\r\nlisted in the annual report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question, Sir, is whether the Ministry will\r\n\r\nconsider  making the process of applying for Medifund assistance\r\n\r\nmore  transparent so that applicants can know  in  advance  what\r\n\r\ncriteria  apply and whether there are avenues available  for  an\r\n\r\nappeal to be made in the event that he or she is unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, at the moment, the use of Medisave is\r\n\r\nlimited  to  payment  of  expenses  in  the  acute-care  general\r\n\r\nhospitals.  The use of Medisave should be extended to bona  fide\r\n\r\nMOH-approved nursing homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like this House to consider the following\r\n\r\noften mentioned factors:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) We are now expecting people to live longer, even beyond\r\n\r\n80 years of age.  As such, there will be an increasing number of\r\n\r\npatients  with  chronic  illnesses and most  of  them  would  be\r\n\r\nrequiring  mainly,  if not, only care in nursing  homes.   Using\r\n\r\nMedisave  and  MediShield would certainly ease the heavy  burden\r\n\r\ntremendously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Obviate the need for some patients opting for the more\r\n\r\nexpensive  hospital  beds.  The  general  preference   of   most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans using Medisave instead of cash is indisputable  and\r\n\r\nunderstandable.   Just  so that the bill  may  be  paid  through\r\n\r\nMedisave, an acute care bed is wasted and at higher cost too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The general and even the community hospitals would have\r\n\r\nlesser  problems  at discharging the less critical  cases.   The\r\n\r\npatients and their families\r\n\r\nwould  be  happier  because there is, at  least,  some  sort  of\r\n\r\ncontinuing care made available to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the above considerations, may I urge the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health to look into this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I continue with my next cut on affordability?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, carry on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> A crucial dilemma which many of our people,\r\n\r\nespecially in their old age, may face in the future will be  the\r\n\r\neffects of having insufficient funds to meet the cost of  health\r\n\r\ncare.   This  can  happen  in spite  of  the  Medisave  and  the\r\n\r\nMediShield schemes which we have in place even as of now.   This\r\n\r\nis due to the fact that people are going to be living longer and\r\n\r\nhealthcare   costs   are  undoubtedly  going   to   be   higher.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  we  do  not have in place the  kind  of  financial\r\n\r\nsupport  needed  by the increasing numbers of  chronic  sick  in\r\n\r\nthose institutions where, at the moment, Medisave and MediShield\r\n\r\ncannot be used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this problem has to be looked into now and we must\r\n\r\ncome  up with the solutions in good time.  The Medifund, set  up\r\n\r\nby  the  Government not too long ago, is one step in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.  However, further steps must be taken or we will need\r\n\r\nhuge  increases in Medifund and other subsidies, at the  expense\r\n\r\nof  the next generation, to cater for the progressive demands of\r\n\r\ngood  healthcare  for all.  This can become a problem  so  large\r\n\r\nthat  the undue economic burdens placed upon the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  future taxpayers become untenable.  Will we always have the\r\n\r\neconomic success to guarantee that no Singaporean will be denied\r\n\r\nof  medical  care due to the lack of means?  Are we prepared  to\r\n\r\nbecome a healthcare welfare state?  No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just one episode of severe illness requiring intensive care\r\n\r\nand  recuperative  stay in hospital can cost more  than  $10,000\r\n\r\neven  at  current C-class bed charges.  For those  with  chronic\r\n\r\nillnesses, substantial amounts of money may be needed for fairly\r\n\r\nfrequent long term hospital stays.  Sir, at the moment the total\r\n\r\namount of Medisave which our CPF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmembers need to set aside is $20,000.  If these CPF members  are\r\n\r\nalso  covered by MediShield, they can claim a maximum of $20,000\r\n\r\nper  policy  year and $80,000 per lifetime.  This means  we  can\r\n\r\nhave one category of people having, at best, access to $100,000.\r\n\r\nWe  have also to consider two other categories, those who cannot\r\n\r\naccumulate  enough Medisave and those who are  already  retired,\r\n\r\nboth  of which not having that much access.  Now, if people  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to be living maybe 20 years beyond their retirement  age,\r\n\r\nthe  very finite amount of $100,000 from their combined Medisave\r\n\r\nand  MediShield,  for  future use, may not  be  enough  even  at\r\n\r\ncurrent  rates.   As  healthcare cost,  in  dollar  terms,  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely  increase,  there will be  heavy  dependence  on  the\r\n\r\nchildren's funds or the Medifund.  It is not good to leave  such\r\n\r\na legacy for our children and country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is having more Medisave the solution? I do not think so.\r\n\r\nFor  a  start, the majority of people would be reluctant to  put\r\n\r\nmore  money aside through compulsory savings.  Should  we  raise\r\n\r\nthe  MediShield coverage?  This is a possibility.   But,  it  is\r\n\r\nlikely   that   this   expenditure  may  just   overburden   the\r\n\r\nsubscribers.   It  is  unlikely that  any  simple  increases  in\r\n\r\npayment will go down well with the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that we consider MEDICARE as a further\r\n\r\ncounter  before  turning to Medifund for help.   The  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  MediShield  and MEDICARE is that  the  latter  will  be\r\n\r\ninsurance  derived from a co-payment scheme with the  Government\r\n\r\nand  it will be cost-index linked.  Perhaps such co-payments may\r\n\r\nbe  made  by the children on behalf of parents who are  near  or\r\n\r\npast  retirement  age.  These features should make  this  health\r\n\r\ninsurance  more  acceptable to the  people  and  they  could  be\r\n\r\npersuaded  to  take up this extra expenditure.   Sir,  the  main\r\n\r\npoint  here is for us to have enhanced health insurance for  our\r\n\r\npeople at affordable rates and to spare the use of Medifund  for\r\n\r\nthe truly deprived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making the public aware and more responsible for their own\r\n\r\nhealthcare will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  the  key to successful implementation of healthcare planning\r\n\r\nfor  the future.

But\r\n\r\nI am looking at what is immediately in front of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we are facing a regional financial and currency\r\n\r\ncrisis.  To  many  people, it is a very  sudden  and  hard  blow\r\n\r\nbecause they really do not know what hit them.  In this economic\r\n\r\nturmoil,  many countries around us have to tighten  their  belts\r\n\r\nand  some  countries,  I  believe, have  told  their  government\r\n\r\ndepartments to cut down on expenditure.   I know of one  country\r\n\r\nin  Southeast Asia where even the Ministry of Health was ordered\r\n\r\nto  cut down on expenditure.  It is an across-the-board cut  of,\r\n\r\nsay,  12% to 15%.  Under the circumstances, the quality of their\r\n\r\nhealth care service will surely be affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our Budget is a prudent one. But at the same\r\n\r\ntime, I hope that in the exercise of prudence in our Budget,  we\r\n\r\nwill  never,  never neglect the healthcare for our  people.   We\r\n\r\nshould  not  cut  down on our healthcare expenditure.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause,  crisis  or  no  crisis, nobody  wants  to  fall  sick.\r\n\r\nHowever,  should somebody  fall sick at this time of crisis,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, he hopes to be able to get the appropriate treatment  in\r\n\r\ntime.  At the same time, when he is receiving his treatment,  he\r\n\r\nalso  hopes that he can afford to pay for the medical  fees  and\r\n\r\nexpenses that follow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that our Singaporeans will not say, \"Don't fall sick\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  It is more expensive to fall sick than to  die!\"\r\n\r\nI  hope the Minister for Health can assure that this is not  the\r\n\r\ncase.    During this turmoil, when we are tightening our  belts,\r\n\r\nwe  are  cutting  down on our expenses.  At the same  time,  our\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, especially the lower-income people, can be assured\r\n\r\nthat their medical care and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmedical  treatment will not be affected by this current turmoil.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the  Government can step forward to assure  these  poor\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that notwithstanding the turmoil, they can continue\r\n\r\nto afford and enjoy good healthcare services in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, the point which I wanted to raise\r\n\r\nconcerns  the  standards of nursing care,  a  question  that  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, Mr Choo Wee Khiang, has already touched on.  However,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to elaborate.  Before I do so, I would  just  say\r\n\r\nthat  the standard of healthcare overall in Singapore has  risen\r\n\r\nover  the years and that this is due in no small measure to  the\r\n\r\ndedication  of  the  doctors,  the nurses,  the  administrators;\r\n\r\nindeed, all the people who work in this industry.  But it  is  a\r\n\r\nmanpower  intensive industry.  And because of this, we  do  need\r\n\r\npeople to get the job done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has over the last few years brought\r\n\r\nin  foreign nurses to meet the current shortage that we have  in\r\n\r\nnursing staff.  And this has given rise to a number of concerns:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Some foreign nurses speak little or poor English. Although\r\n\r\nthey  may be able to read, their grasp of conversational English\r\n\r\nis  poor.  This makes patient-nurse communication difficult,  at\r\n\r\nbest, and suspect from time to time.  The concern raised is that\r\n\r\nmiscommunication over critical issues, such as  medication,  may\r\n\r\nresult in harm to the patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Some nurses may not be exposed to the same level of\r\n\r\ntechnology  in their home countries.  Here the concern  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  may not be using medical equipment properly, and may  make\r\n\r\nmistakes in setting up the equipment or devices.  This may  lead\r\n\r\nto erroneous test results, or to wrong treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Another concern, which may or may not be due only to the\r\n\r\nemployment of foreign nurses, relates to lost records.   I  have\r\n\r\nheard  some  complaints of medical records  being  misplaced  or\r\n\r\nlost.   For  example, patients have been told  that  their  test\r\n\r\nrecords  are missing, and they have to redo the tests  all  over\r\n\r\nagain. This cost is not just in time to redo the tests, but also\r\n\r\nthe  trauma  of  the patient and the time lost in  treating  the\r\n\r\nillness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we welcome foreign talents to work in Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause  they  create even more opportunities for  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nEach  job  they hold means that several other Singaporeans  will\r\n\r\nalso  have jobs.  And indeed we cannot have excellent hospitals,\r\n\r\nworld-class  hospitals, without nurses, and without  the  nurses\r\n\r\nour  best doctors would not be performing surgery here but  they\r\n\r\nwill perform surgery in London or in Houston.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not whether we should have foreign talents\r\n\r\nor  not, but rather how we ensure that standards are not eroded.\r\n\r\nI  would be grateful if the Minister would update this House  on\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  foreign nurses in Singapore, and  the  measures\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Ministry  is  taking to ensure  that  standards  are\r\n\r\nmaintained, not only at the point in time where they bring  them\r\n\r\ninto Singapore but whether there is an ongoing system to monitor\r\n\r\ntheir  performance and to ensure that they are effective and  up\r\n\r\nto the mark.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister whether the\r\n\r\nhospitals  keep  statistics of lost records,  how  serious  this\r\n\r\nproblem  is,  and  whether steps are being taken  to  invest  in\r\n\r\nbetter record-keeping systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\ndeclare  that I am a doctor in private practice.  Over the  last\r\n\r\nfew  years,  the  Ministry of Health has spent much  effort  and\r\n\r\nresources in building new hospitals and medical centres  to  its\r\n\r\ncredit.  However, what makes the medical centre or a hospital  a\r\n\r\ngood  one is not just the physical building or what machines  it\r\n\r\nhas,  but more importantly, these institutions should be  judged\r\n\r\nby the standard and quality of healthcare provided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that the Ministry made an objective assessment\r\n\r\nof  the  quality  and standard of health that is  given  to  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who use public health institutions.  In the  front-line  we  have  our  polyclinics where very often,  doctors  and\r\n\r\nnurses are overloaded with work.  It is time for the Ministry to\r\n\r\ndo  a  clinical  audit  of the outcome  and  standards  of  care\r\n\r\nprovided at our polyclinics.  Many of the lower income families,\r\n\r\nless well-off Singaporeans, and our senior citizens use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  heavily  subsidised  services.  It  is  important  that  we\r\n\r\nprovide  an acceptable quality of care for these patients.   How\r\n\r\nmany  patients  with  high  blood  pressure  have  normal  blood\r\n\r\npressure  after  being  treated at the  polyclinics?   How  many\r\n\r\ndiabetic patients have well controlled blood sugar levels  after\r\n\r\nbeing treated at the polyclinics?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good control of common medical ailments, like high blood\r\n\r\npressure and diabetes, will reduce the incidence of more serious\r\n\r\ndiseases, like stroke and heart diseases.  The Ministry can only\r\n\r\nrealise  its  objective of providing a high quality  of  medical\r\n\r\ncare if the large majority of patients with common ailments  are\r\n\r\nwell  managed.   Hence,  it is time for the  Ministry  to  do  a\r\n\r\nclinical   audit   on  the  standards  of   care   provided   in\r\n\r\npolyclinics.   It  can then identify areas  of  weaknesses,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  if there are insufficient medical staff, and  overcome\r\n\r\nthese problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hospital level, patients who are seen at the\r\n\r\nAccident  and  Emergency Department may have to  wait  for  long\r\n\r\nperiods  before being admitted to the hospitals.   My  residents\r\n\r\nhave  seen  me  to  complain about the long waiting  period  for\r\n\r\ntransfer  to  the  wards after being seen at  the  Accident  and\r\n\r\nEmergency  Department.  Despite the serious illness  that  their\r\n\r\nrelatives  have  had, no beds could be found in  the  subsidised\r\n\r\nward  and they had to wait for several hours.  While waiting  at\r\n\r\nthe Emergency Department for a long duration, no definitive care\r\n\r\nwas administered.  Unfortunately, for two of my residents, their\r\n\r\nrelatives died shortly after admission to the hospital.  I think\r\n\r\nthis  is a major weakness in our hospital system which needs  to\r\n\r\nbe addressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several potential options which the Ministry may\r\n\r\nwant to consider:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First option: to admit subsidised patients who have serious\r\n\r\nillnesses  and  require urgent attention to the first  available\r\n\r\nbed, even though it may mean having a subsidised patient lodging\r\n\r\nat a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npaying  bed  and being charged at subsidised  rates.   This\r\n\r\nshould not only apply after office hours but throughout the day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second option: to have the ward medical team come to the\r\n\r\nEmergency Department to review and treat patients while they are\r\n\r\nwaiting for transfer to the hospital ward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or perhaps a third option: to have a team of doctors at the\r\n\r\nEmergency Department who are sufficiently well trained and whose\r\n\r\nprimary  role  is  to initiate treatment and  do  the  necessary\r\n\r\ninvestigations  while the patient is awaiting admission  to  the\r\n\r\nward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should perhaps also be a classification system for\r\n\r\nadmission.   Patients  who  are  very  ill  and  require  urgent\r\n\r\nattention  should  perhaps  be  classified  as  \"priority   one\"\r\n\r\npatients,  and  these  patients must be  attended  to  within  a\r\n\r\nstipulated  time-frame.   Patients  who  are  ill  and   require\r\n\r\nhospital  admission  but do not require  attention  so  urgently\r\n\r\nshould   perhaps  be  classified  as  \"priority  two\"  patients.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is time to have ISO standards for delivery of medical\r\n\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon admission to the hospital, again, there are other new\r\n\r\ndilemmas.   For  example,  in Singapore General  Hospital  where\r\n\r\nvirtually  all the departments are very specialised  departments\r\n\r\nand  there  is no real general medicine department, there  is  a\r\n\r\ndilemma  for  the  doctor  at the A&E  department  as  to  which\r\n\r\ndepartment  to  admit  the  patient  to,  if  he  has  multiple-problems.   And  when  the patient with  multiple  problems  get\r\n\r\nadmitted to the ward, will the doctors be so focused with  their\r\n\r\nown  specialty that they do not pay adequate attention to  other\r\n\r\nspecialties?   For example, if a patient with breathlessness  is\r\n\r\nadmitted  to the ward and has a heart problem but gets  admitted\r\n\r\nto  the  Chest  Ward, will it be such that the  doctors  are  so\r\n\r\nfocused on the chest problems that the heart problems are missed\r\n\r\ntotally?  I think these and other issues have to be addressed by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry.   Yes, it is good to have new hospitals  and  new\r\n\r\nmachines but I think, most importantly, we must have a high\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandard of medical care.  Only by delivering a good quality  of\r\n\r\nmedical  care,  can Singapore lay its claim to be  a  Centre  of\r\n\r\nMedical Excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I continue, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, in the last few years, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  spent significant amounts of money in  developing\r\n\r\nnew   hospitals  and  specialist  centres.   However,  in   some\r\n\r\nhospitals, the occupancy rate for paying beds is not high.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  I  have  had  the opportunity  to  visit  some  of  my\r\n\r\ngrassroots members who have been hospitalised in the Kent  Ridge\r\n\r\nWing of NUH and I was surprised that the place was rather quiet.\r\n\r\nNot too long ago, it was publicised in the newspapers that there\r\n\r\nwere  plans  for building a hospital wing near NUH  where  Johns\r\n\r\nHopkins Hospital will be involved.  I am concerned that  we  may\r\n\r\nbe  building  more  than  is necessary.   Residents  have  given\r\n\r\nfeedback  that  it is not unusual to wait for long  periods  for\r\n\r\nadmission to subsidised ward.  But it is often not too difficult\r\n\r\nto  get admission to paying wards.  Is there a misallocation  of\r\n\r\nresources  resulting in insufficient subsidised  beds  andby  an\r\n\r\nexcess  of paying beds?  Our hospital facilities should be  used\r\n\r\nefficiently   and  perhaps  the  redistribution  of   beds   and\r\n\r\nallocation  of  resources will help to overcome  some  of  these\r\n\r\nbottlenecks in our public healthcare system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As these medical institutions are built with public money,\r\n\r\nit  is  important that we reassure the public that whether  they\r\n\r\nare   subsidised   or  paying  patients,  they   will   not   be\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged   in  getting  access  into  our  public   medical\r\n\r\ninstitutions.    Hence,  in  the  development  of   our   health\r\n\r\nfacilities, the Ministry must take into account the  demand  for\r\n\r\nsubsidised services.  In this economic downturn, it will not  be\r\n\r\nunexpected that more Singaporeans will use subsidised healthcare\r\n\r\nservices.  If there is an increased demand, will the Ministry be\r\n\r\nmaking adjustment in our healthcare facilities to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeet this increased demand?  If adjustments are being made,  can\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  let the House know what active measures  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken to meet this demand?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, first, let me address the\r\n\r\nquestions  raised by Mr Goh Choon Kang.  Mr Goh Choon  Kang  has\r\n\r\nexpressed  his happiness with the work and outreach of  Medifund\r\n\r\nbut  he  is concerned that there are no additional top-up grants\r\n\r\nto  the endowment fund this year.  He would like the Ministry to\r\n\r\nensure  that  when the economy recovers in future  years,  there\r\n\r\nwill be top-ups to the endowment fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the decision not to top up the endowment fund this\r\n\r\nyear  was  actually taken after very serious consideration.   If\r\n\r\nthe need had arisen for top-ups, I think we would have scrounged\r\n\r\naround  and argued very strongly for top-up.  The fact  is  that\r\n\r\nMedifund  is  actually quite well endowed  now.   We  have  $600\r\n\r\nmillion  and this gives us an annual income of about $21 million\r\n\r\nand,  as  pointed out, the outlay of Medifund a  year  comes  to\r\n\r\nabout  $10  million.   So  that means we currently  have  enough\r\n\r\nrevenue  flows  to  more than meet the  needs  of  the  poor  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And even with the economic downturn, I think we have\r\n\r\nenough  of a cushion there.  But I would like to assure  Mr  Goh\r\n\r\nChoon Kang that once the economy improves, we will of course put\r\n\r\nin our bid for Medifund to be further topped up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann asked two questions. First, whether the\r\n\r\nmedical  social workers actually do brisk screening of  Medifund\r\n\r\napplicants  and,  if  they  did,  would  the  success  rate  (he\r\n\r\nmentioned  99.4%)  still  be correct, or  would  the  figure  be\r\n\r\nactually  lower?   And  secondly,  he  asked  the  Ministry   to\r\n\r\npublicise  more  widely to the public what are  the  avenues  of\r\n\r\nappeal  for  those people who have applied for Medifund  support\r\n\r\nbut have been turned down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me answer the first point. Do medical social\r\n\r\nworkers  screen potential applicants?  To qualify for  Medifund,\r\n\r\nthere are some simple criteria.  Firstly, the patient must be  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  Secondly, the patient must be either a B2 or class\r\n\r\nC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninpatient,  or  if  an  outpatient,  similarly,  he  must  be  a\r\n\r\nsubsidised  patient  or  someone who  is  using  the  polyclinic\r\n\r\nservices.  Thirdly, he has to show that he cannot afford to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  the  hospital  bills that have been levied  on  him.   Very\r\n\r\nsimple  criteria.   If  he  meets those  criteria,  he  is  then\r\n\r\nreferred to the Hospital Medifund Committee for assessment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is the one which I think may sometimes pose\r\n\r\na problem.  Can they afford to pay the hospital bills?  What the\r\n\r\nmedical  social workers would do then is to review the  Medisave\r\n\r\nbalances.   If  there is enough Medisave balance, the  point  is\r\n\r\nthat  they  should then use their Medisave balance first  before\r\n\r\nappealing  for  Medifund.  In any case,  the  Hospital  Medifund\r\n\r\nCommittees  are  made  up  of  grassroots  leaders   and   being\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders,  and having very close  connection  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  on  the ground, the members tend to err on the  side  of\r\n\r\ngenerosity which is why we have such a high success  rate.   Now\r\n\r\nthat  the CDCs are also involved, I think the outreach would  be\r\n\r\neven better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we help to publicise the avenues of appeal? Sir,\r\n\r\nas pointed out by Mr Goh Choon Kang, one common avenue of appeal\r\n\r\nis  really the MPs.  And I have from time to time enquired of my\r\n\r\nMP  colleagues  as  to whether their residents  are  facing  any\r\n\r\nproblems  in getting Medifund help.  I am quite happy to  report\r\n\r\nthat  no MP, including Mr Low Thia Khiang, has told me that  his\r\n\r\nresidents have had problems getting Medifund support.   Usually,\r\n\r\nif  they  face any problems, they will go to the MP and  the  MP\r\n\r\nwill  make  an  appeal.  So far, the Committees have  been  very\r\n\r\nsupportive of the MP's' appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of publicising the avenues, we will continue to do\r\n\r\nthat at the hospital level.  Now that the CDCs are involved,  we\r\n\r\nwill  work  with the CDCs on how to further publicise  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  Medifund is available and if they face any problems,  they\r\n\r\ncan  either  go to their own MP or grassroots organisations  for\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo talked about Medisave and the ability of\r\n\r\npatients  to  afford the healthcare charges even with  Medifund,\r\n\r\nMediShield  and  Medisave.  Sir, I will take her  two  questions\r\n\r\ntogether.   First,  whether Medisave is  adequate  and,  second,\r\n\r\nwhether we can extend Medisave to nursing homes and other  long-term care services.  Sir, Medisave has been a very well thought-\r\n\r\nout scheme, not just in terms of helping Singaporeans to have  a\r\n\r\nsavings  fund,  but also the contribution rate and  the  maximum\r\n\r\nlimit for Medisave account.  Studies have shown that the average\r\n\r\nadult   aged   21  will  require  approximately   55   days   of\r\n\r\nhospitalisation from the age of 21 to the end of his  life.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  that is an average.  You are going to get the outliers.\r\n\r\nIn  any case, based on the 95th percentile of B2 hospital bills,\r\n\r\nwe  have  computed  that  the life-time expenditure  in  today's\r\n\r\ndollars  would  amount  to only $27,000  if  he  uses  B2  class\r\n\r\nfacilities.   If  he  uses A, B1 or private sector  services,  I\r\n\r\nthink the figure would be much, much greater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the key to affordability is that patients should use the\r\n\r\ntype  of service that they can best afford.  If they are in  the\r\n\r\nlower  income group with low Medisave contributions, please  use\r\n\r\nB2  or  C  class  ward.   It is for that  reason  that  we  have\r\n\r\nimplemented  a very rigorous financial counselling programme  at\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals so that patients who are going for A or B1  class\r\n\r\nward  are  told of what to expect in terms of the bill size  and\r\n\r\nare  asked  to  rethink again.  If they do not  think  they  can\r\n\r\nafford that bill size, then they can seek to downgrade to either\r\n\r\na B2 or C class ward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Medisave limit of $20,000 is adequate and the\r\n\r\nMediShield  limit  of  $80,000, that is,  the  basic  MediShield\r\n\r\ncoverage, is more than adequate for a patient who uses B2 and  C\r\n\r\nclass  services even with a catastrophic illness.   It  is  more\r\n\r\nthan adequate.  But, again, of course, for those who tend to use\r\n\r\nhigher  class wards, the MediShield limit will not be  adequate.\r\n\r\nIn  which  case,  I  will  encourage such  patients  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  a higher level of coverage by either  going  for\r\n\r\nMediShield Plus which is available and should cover A and B1, or\r\n\r\nseek private sector coverage.  You have the NTUC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncome which provides a very comprehensive range of catastrophic\r\n\r\ninsurance packages as well as other insurance companies.  So  if\r\n\r\nyou  get the appropriate coverage, it would be enough.   But  if\r\n\r\nyou use a lower coverage to cover a higher cost service like  in\r\n\r\nthe private hospitals, then of course it would not be adequate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicare. Sir, as I have explained, the higher level\r\n\r\ncoverage  is already available, and I would hesitate to  set  up\r\n\r\nanother  system under the Government when the private sector  is\r\n\r\nalready  providing the higher coverage for those  who  prefer  a\r\n\r\nhigher level of service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo is also very concerned about the elderly who require\r\n\r\nlong-term  care or those who require long-term  care.   I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  her that this is a real problem for the future, especially\r\n\r\nwith  the increasing number of elderly and the larger proportion\r\n\r\nof  the  elderly amongst our population.  Sir, whilst there  are\r\n\r\nsome  elderly  who  do require long-term care, fortunately,  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority  of elderly are well elderly and do  not  require\r\n\r\nlong-term care even till their last few days.  There are  people\r\n\r\nwho  remain very healthy right to the very end and then they die\r\n\r\nwithin  a  very short period of time.  Studies have  also  shown\r\n\r\nthat  only  2%  to 3% of the elderly will require  institutional\r\n\r\nlong-term  care,  such as nursing homes or community  hospitals.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, any institutional care is costly.  Even  for  VWO\r\n\r\nhomes  that  are able to offer subsidised charges,  the  average\r\n\r\ncharges  of  between $600-$800 a month would mean a  very  heavy\r\n\r\nburden to many families.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point is that even if we extend Medisave to long-term care, whatever Medisave funds they have will be quickly\r\n\r\ndepleted.  A person who now retires at the age of 55, if he  has\r\n\r\na lot of Medisave balances, he still needs to  retain $15,000 in\r\n\r\nhis  Medisave account.  If he goes into a nursing home and pays,\r\n\r\nsay,  $600  per month charges, that $15,000 would not  last  him\r\n\r\nvery long.   So that is not the solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to think of a different approach and it is towards\r\n\r\nthis   end  that  I  am  also  chairing  an  inter-Ministryerial\r\n\r\ncommittee  on  health care for the elderly.  One of  the  things\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  looking at is how to come up with an  alternative\r\n\r\nfunding   mechanism  for  the  minority  who  require  long-term\r\n\r\ninstitutional  care.   How do we, in the first  place,  help  to\r\n\r\navoid  long-term institutional care?  How do we  keep  the  sick\r\n\r\nelderly  at  home where his medical outlays will  be  minimised?\r\n\r\nThat is really our focus, keep them at home, support them with a\r\n\r\nlot  of  home-based services, so that we limit those who require\r\n\r\nexpensive  long-term institutional care to the minimum.   If  we\r\n\r\nare  able  to do that, the scheme we come out with for financing\r\n\r\nwill  also  be easier  to resolve.  The committee is looking  at\r\n\r\nthat  now  and  I will announce the details when  the  study  is\r\n\r\ncompleted in the coming months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Choo Wee Khiang also spoke about Medifund. He was\r\n\r\nsaying  that he hoped that the citizens of Singapore had  better\r\n\r\nnot  fall sick or they may die.  Sir, the first part is correct.\r\n\r\nI  think all Singaporeans should always say, \"I better not  fall\r\n\r\nsick.\"  But it cannot be a prayer, because keeping yourself  fit\r\n\r\nand  healthy is something which requires an active effort on the\r\n\r\npart  of each and every one of us.  This is the message and  the\r\n\r\nintent of our Healthy Lifestyle programme.  This is to encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to have a healthy lifestyle, to invest in their own\r\n\r\nhealth so that they do not fall sick.  But if they do fall sick,\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all, we have a health care system which will continue\r\n\r\nto  give  them a high standard of care, even though our economic\r\n\r\ngrowth may have slowed down this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health budget, I am happy to inform him, has gone up,\r\n\r\ndespite  the  tight  budgetary constraints.  Our  health  budget\r\n\r\nactually  went  up  by 7.7%, in terms of our  operating  budget.\r\n\r\nWith  this  increase, we would be more than able to  retain  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  subsidies  of 80% subsidy for a Class  C  patient,  65%\r\n\r\nsubsidy for B2, 50% for B2-plus, and 20% for Class B1.  For  the\r\n\r\npolyclinics,  we  will  be able to retain  the  current  subsidy\r\n\r\ntarget of 50%.  I can assure Mr Choo that the support programmes\r\n\r\nare  being  maintained and will be in no  way  affected  by  the\r\n\r\ndownturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr David Lim has asked about the standard of nursing. He\r\n\r\nis  concerned  about  the  impact  of  foreign  nurses,  but  he\r\n\r\nrecognises that they are an important factor; in fact, they  are\r\n\r\nindispensable  in our current context.  He has asked  about  the\r\n\r\ncurrent numbers.  What are the measures to ensure standards  are\r\n\r\nmaintained?   Do  we  have  an  on-going  system  of  monitoring\r\n\r\nstandards?  And, lastly, lost records.  Let me answer  them  one\r\n\r\nby one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of foreign nurses, we have a total of\r\n\r\n1,800  foreign nurses in Singapore.  Of these 1,800 nurses,  83%\r\n\r\nare  working in the public sector. The vast majority are in  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector and they comprise about 17% of the  total  public\r\n\r\nsector nurses.  Therefore, considering that today we have an  8%\r\n\r\nshortage,  if  we did not have the foreign nurses,  can  Members\r\n\r\nimagine  the hospitals running with a 25% shortfall  of  nurses.\r\n\r\nSome services may be even decimated because of that.  There will\r\n\r\nbe  long  queues for operations and for admissions.  So  foreign\r\n\r\nnurses have helped to relieve the shortage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we do face certain problems. Some of them do not\r\n\r\nspeak   proper   English  and  therefore  they   have   problems\r\n\r\ncommunicating  with  some sector of the  population.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nproblem  which,  I  think,  the  hospitals  are  familiar  with.\r\n\r\nBecause even in Singapore, being a multi-racial society, we also\r\n\r\nhave  nurses who can speak English but may not be able to  speak\r\n\r\nanother  of the national languages, or dialects.  Then what  the\r\n\r\nhospitals  try to do is to ensure that there is a  good  mix  so\r\n\r\nthat  there  is some mutual help that takes place  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nhelping to communicate with the patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also concerned about the nurses not being exposed to\r\n\r\nthe  sort of high-tech equipment that we have. The hospitals are\r\n\r\naware that the foreign nurses come from societies with different\r\n\r\ncultural  backgrounds,  different  languages  and  perhaps  even\r\n\r\ndifferent clinical practice.  Therefore, what the hospitals have\r\n\r\ndone  is  to set up orientation and in-house training programmes\r\n\r\nfor the new foreign nurses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhenever  they  join  the hospitals.  And  because  the  foreign\r\n\r\nnurses  are  recruited  in batches, it is  quite  easy  for  the\r\n\r\nhospitals  to  conduct such training programmes.   The  in-house\r\n\r\ntraining will also include orientation, in terms of use  of  the\r\n\r\nsort of equipment that are available in the department that they\r\n\r\nare being sent to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospitals also closely supervise and monitor their\r\n\r\nperformance   to  ensure  that  nursing  standards   are   being\r\n\r\nmaintained    The  feedback is that, from  time  to  time,  some\r\n\r\nnurses  cannot fit in, and the hospitals have had no choice  but\r\n\r\nto  come  to  some  mutual agreement on how to  terminate  their\r\n\r\nservice.  This is also being done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked about lost records. We do have lost medical\r\n\r\nrecords  and I think it is inevitable with the large  number  of\r\n\r\npatients   that   our  system  is  coping  with.    Fortunately,\r\n\r\nimprovements  have  been made.  The number of  lost  records  in\r\n\r\n1990, for example, amounted to 1.7% of all patient load.  As  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of last year, they have dropped to 0.0003% in SGH,  ie,\r\n\r\nalmost  no  lost  records, to a high of 0.4% in  Tan  Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital.  So improvements have been made but I think  more  can\r\n\r\nbe done in the other hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they are looking at now is a programme to computerise\r\n\r\nrecord  keeping.  This has already been looked into  for  X-rays\r\n\r\nand  the  ordering  of  medical  tests.   It  has  already  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  in some of the hospitals and  they will move  on  to\r\n\r\nthe taking of clinical notes and patient diagnosis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Dr Michael Lim has talked about the clinical\r\n\r\noutcome studies.  I will let Dr Aline Wong answer that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has talked about the A&E long waits. Sir, I agree with\r\n\r\nhim  that  some  patients have had to wait at  least  4-5  hours\r\n\r\nbefore  being transferred to the relevant wards during the  peak\r\n\r\nhours.   But  I  want to assure him that the hospitals  have  in\r\n\r\nplace  a rigorous triage system where patients with serious  and\r\n\r\nemergency  conditions  are transferred, immediately  after  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  stabilised,  to the wards.  For  such  cases,  quite\r\n\r\noften, the A&E doctors would even ask the ward doctors to come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown to help in providing that preliminary treatment before they\r\n\r\nare transferred to the wards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70-80% of those requiring admissions from the A&E\r\n\r\ndepartment do have to wait, but most have only to wait  a  short\r\n\r\nwhile.  This is because, since the subsidised wards are all very\r\n\r\nheavily  occupied, the bed management can be a bit of a problem,\r\n\r\nie, they have to maybe move patients around, or sometimes ensure\r\n\r\nthat patients who are being earmarked for discharge that day are\r\n\r\nactually being discharged, even though the family members may be\r\n\r\nhesitant  to take them home.  I am sure Dr Lim is familiar  with\r\n\r\nthis problem since he has worked in the public hospitals before.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we are looking into that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the facilities, he brought up the problem of\r\n\r\nhigh occupancy rate in the B2 and C wards and asked what are  we\r\n\r\ndoing  about that.  Sir, the occupancy rates of the B2 and Class\r\n\r\nC  wards  have  been  going up steadily  over  the  years.   For\r\n\r\nexample, for Class C, in 1992, the occupancy rate was only  75%.\r\n\r\nBut  last year, the occupancy rate has crept up to 93%, and  93%\r\n\r\nmeans that it is full house.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class B2 is still manageable. It is very high but still\r\n\r\nmanageable, at about 87%.  The demand for Class B2 has increased\r\n\r\nbecause,  as  I  have  stated just now, we are  doing  financial\r\n\r\ncounselling.  So more patients are now opting for B2 and C  than\r\n\r\nthey  would  have  otherwise.   Secondly,  we  are  also  having\r\n\r\nsignificant numbers of long-stay elderly patients.  They  should\r\n\r\nactually  be  transferred to a nursing home or  to  a  community\r\n\r\nhospital, just like that step-down care capacity is not adequate\r\n\r\nat  the  present  moment.   So they are being  lodged  by  their\r\n\r\nfamilies  in  the  hospitals.  Of course, we have  patients  who\r\n\r\nshould  be  discharged but whose families refuse to  bring  them\r\n\r\nhome.  These are things that we have to grapple with and we will\r\n\r\nhave to be more stringent in terms of discharging those who  are\r\n\r\nwell enough to be discharged regardless of whether the family is\r\n\r\nready  to take them or not.  Otherwise, patients will suffer  by\r\n\r\nhaving to wait even longer in the A&E departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now reviewing the occupancy levels in the\r\n\r\nrestructured hospitals and, if need be, after ensuring that  the\r\n\r\npatients are being discharged properly, after helping them to be\r\n\r\nadmitted  into  nursing homes and all that.  If  the  demand  is\r\n\r\nstill  there, if the occupancy is still that high,  I  think  we\r\n\r\nhave no choice but to make available more B2 and Class C beds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in nursing homes and community hospitals\r\n\r\nshould  improve  because in the next three  years,  we  will  be\r\n\r\nincreasing the nursing home beds by over 2,000, ie, an  increase\r\n\r\nof  45% and we will be increasing the community hospital beds by\r\n\r\n74.  I think in the next two  years or so, we should be seeing a\r\n\r\nsignificant improvement in the occupancy rates as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, a very short response to Dr Michael\r\n\r\nLim's  concern  about  the quality of  care  in  our  Government\r\n\r\npolyclinics and the issue of clinical audit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, oOver the years, many measures have been\r\n\r\nintroduced   to   ensure  quality  care  to  patients   in   our\r\n\r\npolyclinics.

Promoting\r\n\r\npreventive care as the way to go is accepted by the majority  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare providers.  Failure of preventive care will call  for\r\n\r\nmore  palliative treatment and laborious nursing  of  end  stage\r\n\r\nprogression  of illnesses  This is most unrewarding.   Not  only\r\n\r\ndoes  it  eat  into people's well-being, but it also  eats  into\r\n\r\npeople's pockets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we in Singapore doing enough in this respect? The\r\n\r\nanswer  is \"No\".  Could it be that we are still very much caught\r\n\r\nup in the stage of coping with curing illnesses and the priority\r\n\r\nfor preventive healthcare had to be compromised?  Sir, we really\r\n\r\nhave  to redouble our efforts in promoting preventive healthcare\r\n\r\nif  our nation is to maintain our high healthcare standards  and\r\n\r\nto contain our low healthcare costs well into the next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Health Service does provide health screening and\r\n\r\nsome  preventive  care  for our school children.   It  has  been\r\n\r\nrather   successful  in  this  area  and  this  is  commendable.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is a very different story in the area of the general\r\n\r\nworkforce, the elderly and the womenfolk.  It is this area  that\r\n\r\nwe are concerned about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, only 13.6% of the Ministry of Health budget\r\n\r\nis  allocated to Primary Health Care and Preventive Health Care.\r\n\r\nThere are only five people in the Public Health Department doing\r\n\r\npromotional  work  on  preventive  care  for  the  elderly   and\r\n\r\nwomenfolk in the whole of Singapore.  Another five are  catering\r\n\r\nfor  the  needs  of  the whole mass of the workforce.   This  is\r\n\r\nreally inadequate for promoting healthy lifestyles to the  whole\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that we embark on a mass\r\n\r\npublic education programme on preventive healthcare.  There is a\r\n\r\nneed  to  promote the idea of personal responsibility for  one's\r\n\r\nown  health  and  the  ways of attaining  and  maintaining  good\r\n\r\nhealth.

We can conveniently  reach  a\r\n\r\ntarget group making use of the numerous day care centres for the\r\n\r\nelderly; we can organise mass programme at the community centres\r\n\r\nand  we can increase awareness that such tests are available  at\r\n\r\nthe island-wide and well-scattered polyclinics.  We already have\r\n\r\na  very good network of helpers, like the grassroots leaders and\r\n\r\nother caring residents who can help to reach out to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also need to provide training for facilitators in\r\n\r\nthe  community who have the direct and continuing  contact  with\r\n\r\nthe primary target groups.  These facilitators may be the nurses\r\n\r\nat the polyclinics, community leaders of their community centres\r\n\r\nor  the  personnel officers in the various large companies.   We\r\n\r\nneed  a  more  consistent  island-wide  systematic  approach  to\r\n\r\npromote different aspects of healthy living and preventive care.\r\n\r\nThese  activities  may  include items like  (a)  having  trained\r\n\r\npersonnel  going  around  perhaps on  a  monthly  basis  to  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  community centres or day care centres to  advise  the\r\n\r\nelderly  and  the  womenfolk  , and  (b)  having  another  group\r\n\r\ncovering the community at work at their working places.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Development Councils, the community centres\r\n\r\nand  the  corporate  establishments should  participate  in  the\r\n\r\nlogistics  and planning to reach out to the people.

This is  very  important,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  this  is  a transitional period where they  will  learn\r\n\r\nsocial skills and work skills.

Let  me  clarify  for\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Woodbridge Hospital which administers medicine to\r\n\r\nthe   patients,  the  psycho-social  rehabilitation   programmes\r\n\r\nactually look into the community resources and identify ways  to\r\n\r\nmaximise   the  resources  and  help  patients  lead  fulfilling\r\n\r\nindependent  lives.   At  this  point,  a  large  part  of  this\r\n\r\ninitiative comes from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  community  and the query is: is this a good  strategy  that\r\n\r\nthere is very little supervision from the Ministry of Health?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the VWOs are very frustrated by the efforts in\r\n\r\nsetting  up community mental health services because  when  they\r\n\r\nwrite  to HDB for void decks, their reply is always, \"Sorry,  it\r\n\r\nis not suitable.\"  When they re-suggest new void decks for their\r\n\r\napplications, again it comes back to them and say, \"Sorry, it is\r\n\r\nnot suitable.\" Can the Government help by listing the void decks\r\n\r\nto the VWOs as to which is more suitable in the first place?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, some neighbourhoods and residents do not like the\r\n\r\nidea  of  VWOs setting up mental services in their neighbourhood\r\n\r\nbecause  property sales will go down,  and their property  value\r\n\r\nwill  also go down.  Is this still true?  How can the Government\r\n\r\nhelp to correct this social stigma?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I shall be as brief as I can,\r\n\r\nalthough I have a lot to say.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Home Nursing Foundation, if Members remember, was\r\n\r\nstarted by Dr Toh Chin Chye many, many years ago.  It has a good\r\n\r\nmission  and  that was to take care of the sick at home,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  they have done a very good job.  But I am just  wondering\r\n\r\nwhether we should look at the Home Nursing Foundation again  and\r\n\r\nsee whether we could expand its modalities of care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, I think the Home Nursing Foundation takes\r\n\r\ncare  of the recently discharged hospital cases by dealing  with\r\n\r\nsimple nursing and perhaps some counselling.  But I am wondering\r\n\r\nwhether  we could expand this modality of care.  Because  if  we\r\n\r\nwatch our population pattern, we are getting older, and diseases\r\n\r\nlike diabetes and hypertension are more common, and disabilities\r\n\r\nwill set in, especially when they reach the age of 65 and above.\r\n\r\nWe know all these are coming. So what do we do?  I would propose\r\n\r\nthat at least we must have some proactive programmes on the part\r\n\r\nof the Home Nursing Foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has just mentioned about preventive care. I\r\n\r\nagree  with him, and I have always asked this House to put  more\r\n\r\nmoney  into the primary health care portion rather than  put  so\r\n\r\nmuch  money into hospital care.  But, unfortunately, I lost  the\r\n\r\nbattle.  The Government is putting up huge hospitals.  But  this\r\n\r\nexpansion of the modalities of care would involve actually going\r\n\r\nto  the homes.  How do we manage diabetic patients at home?  How\r\n\r\ndo   we  manage  hypertensive  patients  at  home?   These   are\r\n\r\nchallenges that I would pose to the Home Nursing Foundation: how\r\n\r\nare they going to have programmes to handle all these?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, I would propose that the Home Nursing\r\n\r\nFoundation should actually go along with the allied health  care\r\n\r\nservices that are provided by some societies,  like the diabetic\r\n\r\nsociety, cardiac society. Or the rheumatic society.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthese societies will come in and they can work out programmes as\r\n\r\nto  how  to  manage patients, maximising related to the  various\r\n\r\nsocieties'  expertise so that there will be a good  exchange  of\r\n\r\ninformation and management skills.  To be effective, we actually\r\n\r\nneed  a  proper, if possible, standalone building, for the  Home\r\n\r\nNursing Foundation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

But do you want a reply?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Okay, I will summarise my speech. Most\r\n\r\nimportant, they must give funding.

According to my understanding, the Ministry of  Health\r\n\r\nis  planning  to register  now going about with the registration\r\n\r\nof  acupuncturists.  May I ask the Minister to update the  House\r\n\r\non the for a progress reportprogress?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, I have only about five minutes. I\r\n\r\nreally do not know how I could manage to answer one by one in  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  manner.  But if I can, I would like  to  give  the\r\n\r\nlast speaker the first response.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On acupuncture, the Ministry of Health has adopted a phased\r\n\r\napproach  to the regulation of the Traditional Chinese  Medicine\r\n\r\nPractices  (TCMP), ie, first, we have a phase of self-regulation\r\n\r\nby  the  TCM  community  initially, and  followed  by  statutory\r\n\r\nregulation  at a later stage.  MyThe Ministry of Health  intends\r\n\r\nto  register  acupuncturists in  the  year  2000.   This  is  in\r\n\r\naccordance   with  the  recommendation  of  the   Committee   on\r\n\r\nTraditional Chinese Medicine.  At present, there are about 1,070\r\n\r\nacupuncturists  practising  in Singapore.   Many  of  them  have\r\n\r\npractised  for  a  long time and many practise  on  a  part-time\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect the interest of the public and to raise the\r\n\r\nstandard  of practice of acupuncturists, my Ministry's  approach\r\n\r\nis  to  ensure that applications for registration should meet  a\r\n\r\nuniform, acceptable standard of competency.  To this end, a  set\r\n\r\nof  training  requirements and a common  qualifying  examination\r\n\r\nwill  be  established to ascertain whether applicants  meet  the\r\n\r\nprescribed standard.  Those who pass will be registered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member may well be aware, there is now a\r\n\r\nstandardised  6-year part-time diploma course on TCM,  which  is\r\n\r\noffered  by  the  major  local  TCM training  institutions.  The\r\n\r\nacupuncture  training  offered  by  this  course  will  be   the\r\n\r\nbenchmark training requirement for eligibility to sit the common\r\n\r\nqualifying examination.  New graduates from this course will  be\r\n\r\ndeemed  to have met the training requirement in acupuncture  and\r\n\r\nwill be eligible to sit for the qualifying examination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the transitional period, however, we will give\r\n\r\nconsideration to existing acupuncturists who possess  sufficient\r\n\r\ntraining and experience.  Each application for registration will\r\n\r\nbe  assessed.  Those  who  possess  suitable  qualification  and\r\n\r\nexperience will be exempted from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacupuncture common qualifying examination, either in part or  in\r\n\r\nfull.     For those who do not possess sufficient experience  or\r\n\r\ntraining,  they  will be required to attend  upgrading  training\r\n\r\ncourses and to sit for the common qualifying examination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will encourage a local professional TCM body to\r\n\r\norganise and administer the qualifying examination with the help\r\n\r\nof  foreign TCM experts in setting the questions and the passing\r\n\r\nstandards.   We will also encourage the major local TCM  schools\r\n\r\nto run the upgrading courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above framework for registration of acupunturists\r\n\r\nwill  ensure  a  uniform and upgraded standard  of  practice  of\r\n\r\nacupunture in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me move on to Dr Lily Neo's point. I think I\r\n\r\ncannot  agree with her more that we should put a great  deal  of\r\n\r\nemphasis  on preventive care.  Are we doing enough?   She  said,\r\n\r\nno.   I beg to differ with her.  We try to do as much as we can.\r\n\r\nWe would try to do more.  But it is a matter of judgment at this\r\n\r\npoint whether within the resources we have, we are doing enough.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, we are doing a lot, and I really I would like to  find\r\n\r\nout  from  her  wherehow  she gotets the figures  of  only  five\r\n\r\npeople  within  the  Primary  Health  Department  in  MOH  doing\r\n\r\npreventive health work for the elderly, and only five  to  cater\r\n\r\nto the entire workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise that when you work with the community, it\r\n\r\nis  not  just the number of MOH officers that matters.  We  work\r\n\r\nwith   the   community  organisations.   We  work  through   the\r\n\r\nprofessional  organisations.   We  work  through   the   women's\r\n\r\norganisations.   And  it is through this outreach  that  we  can\r\n\r\nreach  all  sectors of the population.  But  I  agree  with  her\r\n\r\nentirely that preventive healthcare is a very good strategy that\r\n\r\nwill  raise the health of our nation and reduce healthcare  cost\r\n\r\nin the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about home nurses. In fact, the\r\n\r\nHome  Nursing Foundation has been in existence for more than  20\r\n\r\nyears.   It has been doing very good work.  Last year alone,  it\r\n\r\nhad carried out 45,000 visits to homes to do home nursing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  patients.  This is a charitable organisation.  It is not  a\r\n\r\ncommercial organisation.  And patients are charged according  to\r\n\r\ntheir affordability to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the waiting list, yes, we are right now short of\r\n\r\nnursing  home  beds.   In the past six years,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  has worked with the voluntary organisations and we  have\r\n\r\nbuilt  quite  a number of nursing homes that have increased  our\r\n\r\ncapacity  by a great deal.  In the last six years, we had  built\r\n\r\neight  VWO  nursing  homes.  At the At present,  we  have  4,700\r\n\r\nnursing home beds.  Another 11 nursing home projects are in  the\r\n\r\npipeline.  With the completion of these projects, they will  add\r\n\r\nanother 2,100 beds and the total number of beds by then would be\r\n\r\nsufficient to meet our needs by the year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang talked about the significance of the\r\n\r\npsychosocial -socio programmes.  I understand what she means and\r\n\r\nI thank her also for sending me some reading materials.  I think\r\n\r\nthe  concrete expression of this approach would lie in so-called\r\n\r\nhalf-way houses.  There are at the moment a few half-way houses,\r\n\r\none  run  by the Ministry of Health and a few run by VWOs.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health  does work with them.  There  are  visiting\r\n\r\npsychiatrists  who  work  as honorary ordinary  cconsultants  to\r\n\r\nthese  half-way  houses.  So tThey provide the  professional  or\r\n\r\nmedical cover.  They also give professional consultancy to these\r\n\r\nhomes.   So it is not entirely true that our Ministry  does  not\r\n\r\nsupervise their work, or has no inputs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with her that we need to work more in this\r\n\r\ndirection to provide for the number of mental patients  we  have\r\n\r\nin  our  midst  and who, after they have been stabilised,  after\r\n\r\nthey  have  gone through this steady state, need  some  kind  of\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  in  order  for  them  to  be  reintegrated  into\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for social stigma, I am afraid iit is very unfortunate\r\n\r\nthat  in our society there is still quite a bit of social stigma\r\n\r\nattached to mental illness.  That is why my Ministry has  put  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of  emphasis on mental health education  in  public\r\n\r\neducation to raise public awareness and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso to educate the public on the facts about mental health  and\r\n\r\nhow  early detection and management, and so on,  would help  the\r\n\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Tan Cheng Bock talkeds about the need for an\r\n\r\nenlarged  role for the Home Nursing Foundation.   I  also  agree\r\n\r\nwith him.  I can see that the Home Nursing Foundation can play a\r\n\r\nmuch  more proactive role in the community.  It is doing a very,\r\n\r\nvery  good job.  But I think it can still extend its reach  much\r\n\r\nmore  through  partnership  with community-based  organisations,\r\n\r\nincluding the CDCs.  And if Dr Tan Cheng Bock, being a member of\r\n\r\nthe  CDC, would like to work within the Home Nursing Foundation,\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health would be fully behind him.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,012,292,140 for Head P ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $251,062,000 for Head P ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head R -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head R - Ministry of Information and the\r\n\r\nArts.

This subject of National Education exhibition was\r\n\r\nraised last year at the Committee of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupply  debate on MITA, but no decision was reached as  to  when\r\n\r\nthe Government will hold the exhibition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of recent developments in the region and\r\n\r\nthe  impending social unrest that may unfold in our neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries,  I think it makes it even more pressing now  to  have\r\n\r\nthis  National Education exhibition.  Singaporeans  need  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  more aware of our unique position in the region, the  need\r\n\r\nfor sensitivity as regards race, language, religion and culture,\r\n\r\nand the challenges that will face us in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore ask the Minister when will this exhibition\r\n\r\nbe  held,  and if it would be held after all, and  if  he  would\r\n\r\nelaborate on the details of this exhibition?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, the thrust of our\r\n\r\nNational  Education  programme has been to  create  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nawareness  among our young about how this country of  ours  came\r\n\r\ninto being.  I understand that schools and tertiary institutions\r\n\r\nhave  already  embarked on a variety of programmes and  projects\r\n\r\nwith their students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also concerned about the need to introduce NE to\r\n\r\nthe  general  population.  In this regard,  could  the  Minister\r\n\r\nenlighten  us on the efforts thus far taken by his  Ministry  to\r\n\r\nbring the message home to the general population?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this effort is all the more important during this very\r\n\r\ndifficult time.  I echo the sentiments of my Chairman, Mr  Chew.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent debate on the Budget statement, I spoke  about\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  Government  to do  little  things  to  calm  the\r\n\r\nfinancial jitters of the average Singaporean.  Now is  the  time\r\n\r\nperhaps  for us to consider big things to reinforce the  message\r\n\r\nof  unity  among our population.  We have heard of the  need  to\r\n\r\nrally  Singaporeans so that as a nation, we can  ride  out  this\r\n\r\neconomic  storm which is blowing our way.  We do  not  know  how\r\n\r\nthis  storm will develop.

Hence, I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  the  Minister to consider  ways  in  which  we  can\r\n\r\nreinforce  our sense of rootedness to Singapore.   What  can  be\r\n\r\ndone to placate our anxieties and yet strengthen our cohesion as\r\n\r\na people?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder, Sir, if the time is not right for us to also\r\n\r\nconsider roping in the efforts of\r\n\r\nprivate groups in this endeavour.  Could we not mobilise  groups\r\n\r\nat  the  ground  such  as  those affiliated  with  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation, arts groups, media, and other concerned individuals\r\n\r\nto   work  together  on  programmes  and  activities  that  will\r\n\r\nstrengthen our sense of belonging and cohesion?  Private  groups\r\n\r\nare  well  placed to reach out to a wide audience through  their\r\n\r\nvaried and fresh perspectives, diverse fora and activities.  Let\r\n\r\nus  not  restrict our efforts such that we end up  inadvertently\r\n\r\nwriting  off  some groups in our country.  To encourage  private\r\n\r\ngroups,  we  may want to consider putting aside some  funds  for\r\n\r\nthem  to conduct activities related to National Education.   Let\r\n\r\nus  tap  all available resources to build a nation with a strong\r\n\r\nsense  of self.  This is a time for us to re-double our  efforts\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  the small man in the street,  small  community\r\n\r\ngroups  and  other  concerned individuals are involved  in,  and\r\n\r\ncontribute to nation building.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the Programme Advisory Committee\r\n\r\n(PAC)  and the Advisory Committee on Chinese Dramas and  Variety\r\n\r\nShows  (ACCESS) have recently submitted their reports  and  made\r\n\r\nnumerous observations and recommendations to further improve our\r\n\r\nTV  programmes.  I am sure MITA will seriously look at how  best\r\n\r\nto implement some of these recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to seek clarification from the Minister over\r\n\r\nthe  longer term objectives of TCS and TV12 in Singapore.  There\r\n\r\nhas been some concern that there appears a growing imbalance  of\r\n\r\nprogramming in favour of entertainment over current  affairs  on\r\n\r\nair  in these stations.  Most glaringly, viewers have found that\r\n\r\nthe  recent  SilkAir MI185 tragedy was more  widely  covered  by\r\n\r\nforeign stations than our own TV stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are aware that our domestic television stations are\r\n\r\ndriven by commercial interest as they have to remain viable  and\r\n\r\nyet  play  a nation-building role, and it is not easy.  However,\r\n\r\nin  view  of the scarcity of resources in a small country,  like\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it appears that increasingly with competition  posed\r\n\r\nby  cable  TV (SCV), there may be a duplication of resources  if\r\n\r\nTCS  adopts a strategy to keep up with the type of entertainment\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that SCV also caters for.  Furthermore, it  will  be\r\n\r\nbeneficial for Singaporeans who wish to take a greater  interest\r\n\r\nin current and national issues to be able to access specifically\r\n\r\nto  programmes  that  cater to them more specifically  in  these\r\n\r\naspects.  So it must be in the national interest, therefore,  to\r\n\r\noptimise  our  limited  resources by channelling  less  of  TCS'\r\n\r\nresources  towards entertainment and perhaps leaving SCV  to  do\r\n\r\nthe  entertainment programmes, and more resources made available\r\n\r\nto TCS towards nation-building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this, I would like to ask the Minister if\r\n\r\nMITA has plans to really review the focus and the directions  of\r\n\r\nTCS  and  TV12, so as to reduce the potential drain in resources\r\n\r\nfrom  the duplicative nature of the present state of competition\r\n\r\nposed by SCV to these stations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, before I proceed, I need a\r\n\r\nclarification  from you.

But, anyway, the correct form is \"Chairman\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have to admit, and other Members will admit,\r\n\r\nthat  the  quality of the TCS programmes has improved.   Viewers\r\n\r\nnow  have greater opportunity of also switching to Cable Vision.\r\n\r\nThis  imposes  on  our station a greater responsibility.   I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  specially with the news and current  affairs  because\r\n\r\nCable  Vision has got far better inputs and many members of  the\r\n\r\npublic, I know, sometimes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprefer  to  watch  these  programmes.  Only  when  it  comes  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, they want to watch our station.  I think this is sad.\r\n\r\nWe should try to improve the standard.  I am not being critical.\r\n\r\nI  think it is in the interest of Singapore that our station  is\r\n\r\nwatched by everybody because CNN and other stations cannot carry\r\n\r\nthe  message  of  nation-building which  my  friend,  Dr  Yaacob\r\n\r\nIbrahim,  has emphasised, our station can.  In this  respect,  I\r\n\r\nwould urge the Minister to take an interest in this area and  to\r\n\r\nimprove on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take the example of parliamentary reports. It is\r\n\r\nshown 15 minutes after the News.  I think it is rather late.  We\r\n\r\nshould  have it a bit earlier so that school children will  know\r\n\r\nwhat  is happening.  For the last few days, Parliament has  been\r\n\r\nsitting  for  hours, yet in 15 minutes, I think in  fairness  to\r\n\r\nTCS,  you  cannot convey the message.  I know the  Minister  may\r\n\r\nreply,  \"Oh,  there is no audience.\"  I think that  is  not  the\r\n\r\nquestion.   The audience can be built up.  Even if the  audience\r\n\r\nis not there, the people who are going to watch are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant people in the society, and for their interest I  think\r\n\r\nwe  should  try to enlarge, reorganise the programme,  and  also\r\n\r\nchange the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
