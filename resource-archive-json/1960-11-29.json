This   was  a  purely  administrative\r\n\r\narrangement  whereby Ministers in charge  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistries acquired authority over the running of\r\n\r\nthose departments of the City Council which  were\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  them,  but  legal   and   formal\r\n\r\nresponsibility   lies  with  me   together   with\r\n\r\nfinancial and staffing matters. In the course  of\r\n\r\nthis  year,  Sir, the departments have  therefore\r\n\r\nbeen  functioning  within the Ministries,  and  I\r\n\r\nhope they have all gained valuable experience  in\r\n\r\nadvance   of  complete  legal  integration.   The\r\n\r\nMinistries  in  turn have become acquainted  with\r\n\r\ntheir  new responsibilities. They have  drawn  up\r\n\r\nnew  organisational and establishment charts  and\r\n\r\nare ready to assume formal responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second stage is that of financial\r\n\r\nintegration  which  must  take  effect  from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1961, by virtue of the fact\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we have now, in the Budget Estimates to  be\r\n\r\nput   forward   by  the  Minister  for   Finance,\r\n\r\nintegrated  the Budgets of the City  Council  and\r\n\r\nthe  Central Government. Two Bills are  necessary\r\n\r\nfor this purpose: one, the Property Tax Bill and,\r\n\r\ntwo, the Local Government (Financial Integration)\r\n\r\nBill. As regards the Property Tax Bill which  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has  just  introduced  for\r\n\r\nFirst  Reading,  I would like to  anticipate  the\r\n\r\nBill by making a brief reference in case property\r\n\r\nowners  are  unduly upset by the nomenclature  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill,  that  it is an administrative  device\r\n\r\nwhereby local rates on assessments are no  longer\r\n\r\npayable as a result of the abolition of the Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Authority, and a property tax in  lieu\r\n\r\nof  the  local rates is to be introduced  by  the\r\n\r\nProperty  Tax Bill. The assessment provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Municipal Ordinance and the Local Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance will no longer apply in 1961  and  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  replaced by similar provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nProperty   Tax  Bill  coupled  with  the   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment (Financial Integration) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final stage of integration, which we hope\r\n\r\nwill  be completed by the beginning of next year,\r\n\r\nwill  be when the whole process is completed  and\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Utilities Board is set up;  and  the\r\n\r\nstaff,  assets  and liabilities as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nformal  transfer of those functions,  duties  and\r\n\r\npowers now exercised under the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nLocal  Government  Ordinance  and  the  Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  are transferred either to the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board or the Government Ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this last stage will be completed by two\r\n\r\nfurther Bills, the Local Government (Integration)\r\n\r\nBill  and the Public Utilities Bill. We  hope  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  these two Bills, either in January  or\r\n\r\nin February next year. The intention is that they\r\n\r\nshould  all become operative by the 1st of  July,\r\n\r\n1961. This is the date from which the staff would\r\n\r\nbe  formally transferred either to the Government\r\n\r\nor  to the Public Utilities Board, and from  that\r\n\r\ndate  all  Ministries - I  will  divest  myself  of\r\n\r\nformal responsibility for the overall control  of\r\n\r\nstaff  and other matters of the City Council - will\r\n\r\nassume    formal   responsibilities    for    the\r\n\r\ndepartments allocated to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  and  for their functions and duties,  which\r\n\r\nthey are already doing administratively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Local Government (Financial\r\n\r\nIntegration) Bill, its object and purpose  is  to\r\n\r\nenable all moneys received by virtue of the Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Ordinance and the Municipal Ordinance,\r\n\r\nexcepting certain moneys specified in this  Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich  are  to be excluded, to be paid  into  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government's Consolidated Fund. It  also\r\n\r\nprovides  for payments connected with  the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment services and other functions performed\r\n\r\nby  the  Local  Authority to be  charged  to  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund. Clause 3 of the Bill  provides\r\n\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three trading departments are specifically\r\n\r\nexcluded from the provisions of the Bill since it\r\n\r\nis  the  Government's intention  to  establish  a\r\n\r\nPublic Utilities Board comprising the Water,  Gas\r\n\r\nand  Electricity Departments. Their moneys  shall\r\n\r\nbe  continued to be kept separate, and they  will\r\n\r\noperate  their  own Budget. As hon.  Members  who\r\n\r\nhave  already had advance copies of the Estimates\r\n\r\nwill   notice,  the  Budgets  have  already  been\r\n\r\nintegrated. This is a purely administrative  Bill\r\n\r\nto  legalise  the fusion of the two Budgets,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's and the City Council's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[The Prime Minister].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee reported, without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the financial policy\r\n\r\nof the Government for the year 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second budget of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  background against  which  this\r\n\r\nbudget  is  being presented is markedly different\r\n\r\nfrom that a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear  ago.  Then  we  had  to  contend  with   an\r\n\r\natmosphere  of uncertainty. The P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhad been in office for barely five months and  we\r\n\r\nsaw     how    during    election    campaigning,\r\n\r\nirresponsible    Right-wing    Parties     worked\r\n\r\nthemselves  into  a  fright. It  would  not  have\r\n\r\nmattered  if the hysteria they generated confined\r\n\r\nitself  to  those  parties and  their  few  \r\n\r\nwell-wishers. But in the nature of things, the  fright\r\n\r\ncampaign   must   have   further   repercussions.\r\n\r\nAlthough  by November of last year we managed  to\r\n\r\nstabilise the position considerably, there  still\r\n\r\nremained  some  hesitation and uncertainty  which\r\n\r\nhad to be removed before the economy could settle\r\n\r\ndown to effective work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are in office for nearly a year and a\r\n\r\nhalf. In making a review of the economic position\r\n\r\nin  1960, I have the advantage that there has now\r\n\r\nbeen  sufficient  time for our policies  to  make\r\n\r\ntheir impact and for results to be known. This is\r\n\r\nthe ultimate test. For a government is judged not\r\n\r\nso much by its expressions of good intentions but\r\n\r\nby  its  concrete  achievements  in  the  way  of\r\n\r\neconomic prosperity and public welfare.  By  this\r\n\r\nstandard the people of Singapore have done well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year under review has been a good one for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There has been a marked expansion  in\r\n\r\ntrade, in industrial output, in the standards  of\r\n\r\npersonal consumption, in business confidence,  in\r\n\r\nthe  conditions of workers, and in the  level  of\r\n\r\npublic  services. I shall elaborate  on  this  in\r\n\r\nmore detail at a later stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, since Singapore is a centre of\r\n\r\ninternational  trade  and  part  of   the   world\r\n\r\neconomy.  I  must  make a brief review  of  major\r\n\r\neconomic events and trends in the world at large,\r\n\r\nand  more  particularly in our  two  neighbouring\r\n\r\nterritories,   the  Federation  of   Malaya   and\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  In  both the western  world  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunist  countries.  1960  has  generally  seen\r\n\r\nsustained   economic  expansion.  The  industrial\r\n\r\ncountries   of  Europe  consolidated  the   gains\r\n\r\ninitiated in previous years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, however, the expansion was halted in\r\n\r\nthe  third  quarter  of this year  and  important\r\n\r\neconomic  indicators  showed  a  downward  trend.\r\n\r\nHowever, the economies of the western industrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworld had been strengthened to a marked extent in\r\n\r\nthe  last  15 years so that, even if a  recession\r\n\r\nwere  to take place in the United States,  it  is\r\n\r\nunlikely  that  it would lead to a general  world\r\n\r\nrecession. We have moved a long way from the late\r\n\r\n40's  and 50's when even a mild recession in  the\r\n\r\nUnited   States  brought  misfortune   to   other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Economic Development in Asia</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia, the newly independent countries\r\n\r\nstruggle    valiantly   to    achieve    economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  India prepares for a massive  third\r\n\r\nFive-Year  Plan  in an effort to  lift  her  four\r\n\r\nhundred  million  citizens from the  age-old  and\r\n\r\ndire poverty. The Plan envisages a capital outlay\r\n\r\nof  100,000  million Rupees. The  rate  of  gross\r\n\r\ncapital  accumulation  is to  be  increased  from\r\n\r\nabout 11 per cent at present to about 14 per cent\r\n\r\nby   1965-66.  Large  new  industries  are  being\r\n\r\nestablished.    Through    extensive    community\r\n\r\ndevelopment schemes, India tries to spur  on  her\r\n\r\nstagnant   rural  economies  to  race  ahead   of\r\n\r\npopulation  pressure.  Other  South  and  \r\n\r\nSouth-Eastern  Asian  countries too have  accepted  the\r\n\r\nover-riding importance of economic development as\r\n\r\na  national objective, though most of  them  have\r\n\r\nnot achieved, so far, the success in planning and\r\n\r\nexecution that India has.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In East Asia, the other Asian colossus, China\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  make  great  strides  in  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment. Through the stern discipline of  the\r\n\r\nCommunist society, the Chinese have been able  to\r\n\r\nmobilise  the manpower resources more effectively\r\n\r\nthan those countries constrained by the processes\r\n\r\nof   democratic  persuasion.  When  six   hundred\r\n\r\nmillion  industrious  people  apply  their  brain\r\n\r\npower and muscle power in a concerted effort, the\r\n\r\nresult  cannot be other than a prodigious advance\r\n\r\nin material output.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the non-Communist Asian countries, Japan\r\n\r\nhas   shown   the  most  striking  expansion   of\r\n\r\nindustrial  output. The Japanese plough  back  no\r\n\r\nless than 25 per cent of their national income to\r\n\r\nexpand their economy, a rate that has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfew  equals  in contemporary history. The  result\r\n\r\nhas  been a rate of development that exceeds  the\r\n\r\nbest  achieved by Western Germany, whose economic\r\n\r\nrevival after the war has been acclaimed  by  all\r\n\r\nas nothing short of miraculous. In 1959 the Gross\r\n\r\nNational  Product of Japan increased  by  16  per\r\n\r\ncent, a world record. Industrial output increased\r\n\r\nby 29 per cent. Yet this phenomenal expansion did\r\n\r\nnot bring in its train price-inflation or balance\r\n\r\nof  payment difficulties. Prices were steady  and\r\n\r\nJapan's   foreign   exchange  reserves   actually\r\n\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the general picture in Asia is one in which\r\n\r\nevery   Government  has  accepted,  as  a   prime\r\n\r\nobjective  of  policy, the  conquest  of  poverty\r\n\r\nthrough the expansion of material output  by  the\r\n\r\napplication  of capital and know-how.  Asians  no\r\n\r\nlonger  accept poverty, disease and ignorance  as\r\n\r\nthe  natural  order  of human society.  All  move\r\n\r\nforward,  or  try  to  do  so,  towards  improved\r\n\r\nmaterial  well-being. But the journey is  a  long\r\n\r\nand  harsh one and not everyone is aware  of  the\r\n\r\nsustained  effort and sacrifices that  this  must\r\n\r\nimpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Federation of Malaya</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, favourable conditions in the Western\r\n\r\nindustrial world send their impulses to  the  raw\r\n\r\nmaterial  producing countries  of  tropical  Asia\r\n\r\nthrough  better prices of raw materials.  In  our\r\n\r\ncase,  this takes the form principally of  higher\r\n\r\nprices  for  rubber and tin. Rubber  remained  at\r\n\r\nover  $1 for the best part of this year, reaching\r\n\r\nthe  peak of $1.43 in May. Since the latter  half\r\n\r\nof  September, there has been a sustained decline\r\n\r\nin  prices of rubber. Rubber and tin prices  have\r\n\r\nbrought about a marked increase in prosperity  in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  through  increasing  both   the\r\n\r\nGovernment revenues and the incomes of  companies\r\n\r\nand  persons. In Indonesia, rubber prices had not\r\n\r\nonly increased her foreign exchange earnings, but\r\n\r\nalso  increased  the  physical  quantity  of  her\r\n\r\nrubber  exports. The effect of this has  been  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  purchasing  power  in  these   two\r\n\r\ncountries. Singapore has directly benefited  from\r\n\r\nprosperity  in  the Federation, although  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  Indonesia, the level of trade  has  not\r\n\r\nexpanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term prospects for rubber, according\r\n\r\nto   expert   opinion   is  sound.   Furthermore,\r\n\r\nextensive replanting of rubber undertaken by  the\r\n\r\nFederation in past years will be reflected in the\r\n\r\nyears  to come in increasing production. Part  of\r\n\r\nthis  increased output will flow to  the  world's\r\n\r\nmarket through the port of Singapore, and this is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  we  can look  forward  to  with\r\n\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my last budget speech, I referred to the\r\n\r\nnecessity  for establishing some form  of  common\r\n\r\nmarket  arrangements with the Federation. Members\r\n\r\nalready  know  that discussions on this  proposal\r\n\r\nhad  already commenced with the Government of the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya, who are  making  a  close\r\n\r\nstudy  of the scheme which we submitted to  them.\r\n\r\nAs  the matter is still under consideration, I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  it  appropriate for me  to  make  any\r\n\r\npublic   comment  on  it.  A  matter   of   vital\r\n\r\nimportance  in  our economic relations  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya is one  that  affects  our\r\n\r\ncurrency arrangements. The currency we are  using\r\n\r\nis  one  in  which the Governments  of  the  five\r\n\r\nterritories participated, namely, Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya,  the  State  of   Brunei,\r\n\r\nSarawak and North Borneo. In February this  year,\r\n\r\nthe  five  Governments  initialled  an  agreement\r\n\r\nwhich   makes  for  certain  changes  which   are\r\n\r\nnecessary  by  virtue  of  the  status   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya as an  independent  State.\r\n\r\nThis  agreement has been given legislative effect\r\n\r\nby  the  passage  through this  Assembly  of  the\r\n\r\nCurrency Ordinance on the 21st of September  this\r\n\r\nyear. It now remains for all the participants  to\r\n\r\nbring  into  force  the various ordinances  taken\r\n\r\nthrough  their legislatures. As a trading centre,\r\n\r\nwe  understand the imperative need for  a  strong\r\n\r\nand  stable currency. The Malayan dollar with its\r\n\r\nautomatic  convertibility  into  sterling,   made\r\n\r\npossible   by   substantial  overseas   reserves,\r\n\r\nprovides such a strong currency. So now  we  have\r\n\r\nfive  territories  in this  area,  which  have  a\r\n\r\ncommon  historical background of British colonial\r\n\r\nrule,  sharing  a  common currency.  This  surely\r\n\r\nstands  as  a stabilising economic force  to  the\r\n\r\nadvantage of all the participants. It is the hope\r\n\r\nof my Government that it would be possible to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nretain, if necessary with suitable modifications,\r\n\r\nthe  present co-operative arrangement between the\r\n\r\nfive  territories  which has worked  so  well.  A\r\n\r\nstrong  currency is something we enjoyed  for  so\r\n\r\nlong  in  the past that its importance has  often\r\n\r\nbeen  taken for granted and even overlooked.  But\r\n\r\nwithout  the  firm  financial  base  of  a  sound\r\n\r\ncurrency,  no underdeveloped region can  hope  to\r\n\r\ntackle   the   immense   problems   of   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Indonesia</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to Indonesia. The improvement in our\r\n\r\nrelations  with  Indonesia, to which  I  referred\r\n\r\nlast  year,  continues to make progress.  A  Fact\r\n\r\nFinding   Mission  was  sent  by  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment  to Singapore and it held  talks  with\r\n\r\nofficials  of the Singapore Government  at  which\r\n\r\nuseful  interchange  of  views  took  place.  The\r\n\r\nSingapore Government intends to dispatch its  own\r\n\r\nFact Finding Mission to Djakarta to clear the way\r\n\r\nfor a trade agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the problems arising in our trade with\r\n\r\nIndonesia are long standing and difficult.  While\r\n\r\nwe are a free trade economy with controls reduced\r\n\r\nto  the barest minimum, the Indonesians prefer  a\r\n\r\npolicy  of  \"guided economy\".  This,  in  effect,\r\n\r\nmeans  the imposition of controls over all  major\r\n\r\naspects of trade and production. What we have  to\r\n\r\ndo  is  to  meet  the legitimate requirements  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia's guided economy in such a way  as  not\r\n\r\nto  destroy our entrepot trade. Again, as this is\r\n\r\na  matter  which is under discussion between  the\r\n\r\ntwo  Governments, I do not think  it  appropriate\r\n\r\nfor  me  to  make  any detailed public  comments,\r\n\r\nexcept  to hope that the solution which  will  be\r\n\r\nmutually  satisfactory  to  both  countries  will\r\n\r\nemerge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we are pressing ahead with our\r\n\r\nplans   to   establish  a  Trade   and   Cultural\r\n\r\nCommission in Djakarta. I expect that  this  will\r\n\r\nbe established early next year. During the period\r\n\r\nunder  review,  trade with Indonesia  fell  to  a\r\n\r\nslightly  lower level as compared with 1959.  Our\r\n\r\nexports  to  Indonesia averaged $9.8 million  per\r\n\r\nmonth this year as against $10.9 million in 1959.\r\n\r\nCertain items, such as textile yarn,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshowed  a substantial increase, being about  $943\r\n\r\nthousand  per  month this year as  compared  with\r\n\r\n$553 thousand last year. But many items declined.\r\n\r\nFollowing   upon   the   strengthening   of   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian foreign exchange reserves,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  greater diversification in the items  in\r\n\r\nour  export to her, and one hopes that this trend\r\n\r\nwill   continue.   Our  imports  from   Indonesia\r\n\r\naveraged $83.4 million per month as against $94.6\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1959.  Rubber,  the  most  important\r\n\r\ncommodity, showed little change, averaging  $50.0\r\n\r\nmillion  per  month this year  as  against  $49.7\r\n\r\nmillion  last year. Petroleum products  showed  a\r\n\r\nsevere decline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Improvement in Singapore in 1960</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now review how Singapore has fared so far\r\n\r\nthis  year.  I  referred before to  the  improved\r\n\r\nconditions  in  the  trade and  industry  of  our\r\n\r\nState.  May  I  be  permitted  to  amplify   this\r\n\r\nstatement.  There was an increase in our  foreign\r\n\r\ntrade,  as I mentioned before. Total imports  and\r\n\r\nexports  increased from $5,348  million  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst 9 months of last year to $5,720 million for\r\n\r\nthe corresponding period this year. In percentage\r\n\r\nterms this means an increase of 7 per cent.  This\r\n\r\nincrease  did  not  result entirely  from  higher\r\n\r\nprices  of  rubber  and other  primary  products.\r\n\r\nThere was also an increase in the physical volume\r\n\r\nof  goods handled. The greater physical volume of\r\n\r\ntrade  shows  itself  in the figures  of  cargoes\r\n\r\ndischarged and loaded in Singapore. From  January\r\n\r\nto July this year the general cargo discharged at\r\n\r\nthe  Harbour Board wharves was 1.215 million tons\r\n\r\ncompared  with  1.132  million  tons  last  year,\r\n\r\nrepresenting an increase of 7.3 per  cent.  Cargo\r\n\r\nloaded rose from 1.035 million tons last year  to\r\n\r\n1.074 million tons this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improved trading position is reflected in\r\n\r\nthe  financial  statistics of the  country.  Bank\r\n\r\nadvances to customers increased from $503 million\r\n\r\nin  January  to $569.5 million in September.  The\r\n\r\nmajor part of this increase in bank advances\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwent to trade and commerce. In January this year,\r\n\r\n$336.7  million was advanced to trade  rising  to\r\n\r\n$388.4 million in September, an increase of  more\r\n\r\nthan 15 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing industries of Singapore saw a\r\n\r\ngeneral advance in production. Published material\r\n\r\non   this   subject  is  somewhat   patchy.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has decided to remedy this  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  for,  having regard  to  the  importance\r\n\r\nwhich it places on industrialisation, it is vital\r\n\r\nthat much more statistical information about  our\r\n\r\nindustries  should  be at our disposal  than  now\r\n\r\nexists. Accordingly a census of manufacturers was\r\n\r\ncarried out in the third quarter of this year and\r\n\r\nthe  results  are being compiled. The  census  of\r\n\r\nmanufacturers is based on a coverage of all firms\r\n\r\nemploying  10 workers or more per factory  and  a\r\n\r\nsample  survey  of  10 per cent  of  the  smaller\r\n\r\nestablishments. It is proposed to carry out  this\r\n\r\ncensus annually so that the Government shall have\r\n\r\nat  its disposal comprehensive and reliable  data\r\n\r\non the progress of industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results will not be available for some time\r\n\r\nyet   and  we  have  to  rely  on  the  scattered\r\n\r\ninformation  which it had been the past  practice\r\n\r\nto  collect. This shows a fairly substantial  all\r\n\r\nround  increase  in the output  of  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries. Other than soft drinks and soap,  all\r\n\r\nindustries  covered  show considerable  advances.\r\n\r\nThe  cigarette industry continues to  make  great\r\n\r\nstrides, the quantity produced in the first  nine\r\n\r\nmonths  of  the year increasing from 1.6  million\r\n\r\npounds  in 1959 to 2.1 million pounds this  year,\r\n\r\nan  increase  of  28 per cent.  Other  industries\r\n\r\nwhich show substantial progress are coconut  oil,\r\n\r\n25  per  cent increase, rubber footwear,  23  per\r\n\r\ncent  increase, and remilled rubber 36  per  cent\r\n\r\nincrease.   The   electric  power   consumed   by\r\n\r\nindustries increased by 13 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry which had been\r\n\r\ndepressed  for  some considerable time  began  to\r\n\r\npress  ahead.  This was principally  due  to  the\r\n\r\nbuilding programme of the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard, which was established\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis year. The Board lost no time in getting down\r\n\r\nto   work   and  pulling  itself   out   of   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  created  in  the  S.I.T. by   the\r\n\r\nmismanagement of the former Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  The  Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nhas  to  date awarded contracts to the  value  of\r\n\r\n$21.8 million and by the end of this year expects\r\n\r\nto  increase it to $27.3 million. This will  mean\r\n\r\nthat  in  about  a year's time,  when  all  these\r\n\r\nhouses  and flats would be completed,  8,350  new\r\n\r\nhomes   will  be  available  for  the  ill-housed\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore. An innovation  which  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board intends to introduce is the $20 per\r\n\r\nmonth  one-room flat for workers whose income  do\r\n\r\nnot permit them better accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revival of the construction industry this\r\n\r\nyear   brings  about  improved  figures  in   the\r\n\r\nproduction and import of building materials.  The\r\n\r\noutput  of sawn timber has increased from  10,300\r\n\r\ncubic  tons in January this year to 16,700  cubic\r\n\r\ntons  in August. Imports of cement and steel bars\r\n\r\nincreased  substantially in  the  course  of  the\r\n\r\nyear.  For the third quarter of this year,  these\r\n\r\nare   34   per  cent  and  20  per  cent   higher\r\n\r\nrespectively  than  the average  for  last  year.\r\n\r\nBricks  have gone down badly but this appears  to\r\n\r\nresult   from  the  greater  use  of   substitute\r\n\r\nmaterial, principally cement blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expansion of trade and industry going\r\n\r\non  at  the  rate described above, it  is  to  be\r\n\r\nexpected  that,  as people have  higher  incomes,\r\n\r\nthey  will purchase more goods. There are certain\r\n\r\nconsumer  goods  the  demand for  which  reflects\r\n\r\nsensitively  changes in personal  incomes.  These\r\n\r\nare  the luxury and semi-luxury goods. The import\r\n\r\nof  refrigerators  showed a  continuous  increase\r\n\r\nduring  the year. For the third quarter  of  this\r\n\r\nyear,  the  number of refrigerators imported  was\r\n\r\nmore than 50 per cent higher than the average for\r\n\r\n1959. The registration of new motor cars showed a\r\n\r\nsimilar  marked increase. Compared with the  1959\r\n\r\naverage, new motor car registrations were 39  per\r\n\r\ncent  higher  in the third quarter of  this  year\r\n\r\nthan   in  1959.  The  number  of  motor   cycles\r\n\r\nregistered showed an even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreater increase - in the third quarter of 1960, it\r\n\r\nwas  more  than  2\u00bd times last  year's  average\r\n\r\nquarterly  rate. So too were the  number  of  new\r\n\r\ndriving   licences.  This  showed  a   continuous\r\n\r\nincrease during the year, from 5,500 in the first\r\n\r\nquarter to 6,300 in the third quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the indications are that there was a\r\n\r\nsolid and substantial revival of the economy this\r\n\r\nyear. What is remarkable in this economic revival\r\n\r\nis that the expansion in trade and production did\r\n\r\nnot  bring  about any inflationary  process.  The\r\n\r\ncurrency  in  circulation for the Malayan  dollar\r\n\r\narea   remained  practically  stationary,   being\r\n\r\n$1,162  million in January and $1,166 million  in\r\n\r\nSeptember. Prices of consumer goods did not rise.\r\n\r\nOn  the  contrary, the official index  of  retail\r\n\r\nprices showed a decline of 5.4 points from  317.2\r\n\r\nin  January  to 311.8 in September. I am  acutely\r\n\r\naware of the inadequacies of the present official\r\n\r\nprice  index  and am taking steps to institute  a\r\n\r\nnew  series which will have a more scientific and\r\n\r\nrealistic  basis.  Whatever  the  faults  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  index, if there is any error introduced,\r\n\r\nit  would be in the direction of understating the\r\n\r\nfall  in prices. This is due to certain technical\r\n\r\nreasons into which I need not enter here.  Taking\r\n\r\ninto  account all items of consumer goods in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of the year, there has been a significant\r\n\r\nfall  in prices. There are very few instances  in\r\n\r\ncontemporary  economic  history  where   economic\r\n\r\nexpansion    and    falling    prices    occurred\r\n\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>New Industries</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of industrial expansion has shown\r\n\r\nimprovement since the last budget. There are  now\r\n\r\nno  less than 54 projects under various stages of\r\n\r\nconsideration  for the award of  pioneer  status.\r\n\r\nTwenty-six projects can be considered to be  firm\r\n\r\nproposals  and  gazette notifications  have  been\r\n\r\nissued or will soon be issued in respect of those\r\n\r\nthat  qualify  for pioneer status.  The  two  oil\r\n\r\nrefineries  have  already  been  awarded  pioneer\r\n\r\nstatus and construction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork  has  commenced. Some of the new  industries\r\n\r\nfor  which  pioneer  status is  being  considered\r\n\r\ninclude  the  manufacture  of  a  wide  range  of\r\n\r\nconsumer   goods   such   as   condensed    milk,\r\n\r\nchocolates, toothpaste, garments, matches and  so\r\n\r\nforth.  Among  the  major  proposals  are   flour\r\n\r\nmilling,  textile  weaving and  a  steel  rolling\r\n\r\nmill.  The  total capital involved in  all  these\r\n\r\nprojects is well over $100 million, and when they\r\n\r\nare  in  operation, they would provide employment\r\n\r\nfor more than 2,500 workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Projects still in the exploratory stages include\r\n\r\na  wide  range of industries. I do not,  however,\r\n\r\npropose to supply more information about them  at\r\n\r\nthis  stage.  The  authorized  capital  of  these\r\n\r\nprojects is estimated to be in the region of  $70\r\n\r\nmillion  and  they would provide  employment,  if\r\n\r\ncarried to fruition, for some 2,000 workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As distinct from the establishment of new\r\n\r\nindustries,   the  expansion  of  existing   ones\r\n\r\nproceeds   apace.   Many  of  these   are   small\r\n\r\nestablishments. Since we assumed office, 85 small\r\n\r\nfactories have been established providing a total\r\n\r\nemployment of 1,049 workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal circumstances, industrial expansion of\r\n\r\nthe  scale  I  have described can  be  considered\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  However, in the present  situation\r\n\r\nof  Singapore with its population explosion, much\r\n\r\nmore is required. An expansion of at least 2 to 3\r\n\r\ntimes  the present rate would be necessary.  Much\r\n\r\nmore needs to be done to accelerate the growth of\r\n\r\nindustry. Members are aware of the various  teams\r\n\r\nof  international experts who have recently  been\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and who are, at the present moment,\r\n\r\nconducting  their investigations here.  There  is\r\n\r\nMr P. L. Schereschewsky who came to Singapore in\r\n\r\nJuly  this  year on a preliminary  study  of  the\r\n\r\nprospects  of  establishing a steel  industry  in\r\n\r\nthis  island.  He  has completed his  preliminary\r\n\r\nreport and will return soon with a larger team of\r\n\r\nspecialists in various lines of steel  production\r\n\r\nand marketing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mission sent by the United Nations Technical\r\n\r\nAssistance  Administration to  study  methods  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  expansion in Singapore  is  the  most\r\n\r\npowerful  team that has been dispatched  by  that\r\n\r\norganisation.   It  is  headed  by   Dr   Albert\r\n\r\nWinsemius who has a distinguished record both  as\r\n\r\na  Government  official and as an  industrialist.\r\n\r\nMembers   of   his  team  include  an  Electrical\r\n\r\nEngineer,   a  Chemical  Engineer,  a  Mechanical\r\n\r\nEngineer,  an  Industrial  Site  Planner  and   a\r\n\r\nShipbuilding Engineer. The team has been  working\r\n\r\nvery  hard  since their arrival in  October  this\r\n\r\nyear  and  we  look  forward to  receiving  their\r\n\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the conditions necessary for rapid\r\n\r\nindustrial  growth  is  peace  and  stability  in\r\n\r\nlabour-management    relations.    The     P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment is a Government elected by the  people\r\n\r\nand  is one that is partial to the working class.\r\n\r\nIt  is  to  be  expected that workers  and  their\r\n\r\nunions  would take steps to redress the disparity\r\n\r\nof   power  which  they  experienced  under   the\r\n\r\nprevious Government. There have been a number  of\r\n\r\nclaims  for  wage increases nearly all  of  which\r\n\r\nwere  settled amicably by negotiation. There have\r\n\r\nbeen   more   claims  for  fringe  benefits   and\r\n\r\nsubstantial gains were made in respect of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is natural that employers profess alarm at\r\n\r\nthe  revival  of  trade union strength.  Although\r\n\r\nthere  have been some individual instances  where\r\n\r\nthe  unions displayed an unnecessary waywardness,\r\n\r\non   the  whole  the  labour  position  is   well\r\n\r\ncontained through co-operation between the  union\r\n\r\nleaders  and the Ministry of Labour and Law.  For\r\n\r\nthe  most  part  both labour and management  have\r\n\r\nshown    good   sense   to   effect   settlements\r\n\r\nsatisfactory to all. Those who take alarm at  the\r\n\r\nmanifestations  of  increasing  activity  of  the\r\n\r\nunions should not lose their sense of proportion.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. Government is fully aware of the need\r\n\r\nfor peace and stability. This is one of the basic\r\n\r\npillars  of our policy. The close attention  with\r\n\r\nwhich  we have paid to this problem has expressed\r\n\r\nitself in many items of legislation, particularly\r\n\r\nin  the  recent  establishment of the  Industrial\r\n\r\nCourt.  The  P.A.P. Government is as  anxious  as\r\n\r\nanybody else\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  press  ahead  with  the industrialisation  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  which cannot be brought  about  under\r\n\r\nunsettled  labour conditions. The Government  has\r\n\r\nasked  the  Singapore Trades Union  Congress  for\r\n\r\nfull  and  wholehearted co-operation in  bringing\r\n\r\nabout  this  stability  and  discussions  are  in\r\n\r\nprogress on how this can be brought about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>The Economic Policy of the P.A.P. Government</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discussed industrial expansion and its\r\n\r\nrelation   to   labour   and   capital   in   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances we find ourselves in Singapore. The\r\n\r\npolicy  of the P.A.P. Government in these matters\r\n\r\nis  implied rather than explicitly stated  in  my\r\n\r\nremarks. I wish to take this opportunity to dwell\r\n\r\nmore extensively on it for now we are entering an\r\n\r\narea  in  which  the  cobwebs  of  prejudice  and\r\n\r\npreconceptions   abound   and   frustrate   clear\r\n\r\nthinking.  It is important that these cobwebs  be\r\n\r\nswept   aside  so  as  to  leave  no   room   for\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding.  There is  no  doubt  that  the\r\n\r\nvolume of misunderstanding is considerable  among\r\n\r\nthe unthinking sections of the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman is somewhat surprised that not\r\n\r\nonly have we not expropriated his property but we\r\n\r\nhave   given   him   every   encouragement    and\r\n\r\nopportunity   to  expand  his  enterprise.   Some\r\n\r\ndoctrinaires are angered that we have not  pulled\r\n\r\ndown the house in the name of revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic revival which I discussed has been\r\n\r\ncontrived   principally  through   the   existing\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of  free enterprise.  A  number  of\r\n\r\npersons in left wing organisations, trade unions,\r\n\r\npolitical  parties and so forth on noticing  this\r\n\r\nphenomenon have expressed dissatisfaction. It  is\r\n\r\nsometimes  alleged  in these  quarters  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  moved  away from  its  revolutionary\r\n\r\nideas.  I  want  to examine these allegations  in\r\n\r\nsome  detail  and  in  so doing  to  clarify  the\r\n\r\neconomic policy of the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some persons who call themselves socialists\r\n\r\nalmost  regard as an axiom that when a  socialist\r\n\r\ngovernment  assumes power it must set  about  the\r\n\r\ntask of socialising the means of production. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimple  words  this  means nationalising  private\r\n\r\nbusiness. What is the P.A.P. policy on this?  Did\r\n\r\nwe  say  to  the electorate that we  intended  to\r\n\r\nnationalise private business and on assumption to\r\n\r\noffice go back on our words?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the evidence points to the contrary. In the\r\n\r\nseries  of  electoral statements which have  been\r\n\r\ncompiled  in a volume entitled \"The Tasks \r\n\r\nAhead - P.A.P.'s   5-Year  Plan - 1959-64\",   the   chapter\r\n\r\ndealing with economic policy states quite clearly\r\n\r\nthat  the  industrialisation  programme  will  be\r\n\r\nachieved  through  the  institution  of   private\r\n\r\nownership  and free enterprise. We even  went  to\r\n\r\nthe  extent of stating our stand towards  foreign\r\n\r\nbusinessmen, and I quote from page 25 of  Part  I\r\n\r\nof the \"The Tasks Ahead\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Foreign business concerns which wish to\r\n\r\nestablish  factories in Singapore will  be  given\r\n\r\nall  the encouragement and assistance they  need.\r\n\r\nWe  shall  give  them  guarantees  in  regard  to\r\n\r\nsecurity of capital, remittance of dividends  and\r\n\r\nother matters which all modern governments regard\r\n\r\nas normal practice\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Fourth Anniversary Celebration Souvenir\r\n\r\nnumber  of the Party published as early as  1958,\r\n\r\nit  was  made  quite clear that we have  not  the\r\n\r\nslightest intention on assumption of office to go\r\n\r\nfor nationalisation. May I quote from page 14  of\r\n\r\nthe Souvenir number:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The first and most obvious conclusion we can\r\n\r\ndraw is that the scope of realising socialism  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is narrow. The entrepot trade cannot be\r\n\r\nsocialised.  Such factories as we  now  have  are\r\n\r\nhardly worth nationalising and they should remain\r\n\r\nin private ownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is required in the next few years is a\r\n\r\nsubstantial     expansion    of     manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries.  How  is this to take  place?  It  is\r\n\r\nobvious  that private enterprise should be  given\r\n\r\nthe   maximum  encouragement  to  establish   new\r\n\r\nfactories in order to provide employment for  our\r\n\r\nincreasing population\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could be clearer than that we have been\r\n\r\nconsistent  in our actions and that  our  present\r\n\r\npolicies  date  back from unequivocal  statements\r\n\r\nmade  before the elections to the public  and  to\r\n\r\nthe electorate. It is therefore absolute nonsense\r\n\r\nto  say  that we have deviated from our  previous\r\n\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can our policies be distinguished from those\r\n\r\nof a non-socialist government? The answer to this\r\n\r\nquestion can be set out both in terms of  general\r\n\r\nprinciples  and  in  relation  to  the   specific\r\n\r\nproblems  facing Singapore. In countries emerging\r\n\r\nfrom colonial rule, an immense amount remains  to\r\n\r\nbe  done  to bring about equality of opportunity,\r\n\r\nin  the  abolition of unearned privilege, in  the\r\n\r\nattack on the evils of poverty and ignorance  and\r\n\r\ngenerally  in laying the foundations  of  a  more\r\n\r\njust  social order. It can redress the  imbalance\r\n\r\nbetween the working class and the employers which\r\n\r\nin   the  colonial  regime  was  tipped  strongly\r\n\r\nagainst  the workers. Under the colonial  regime,\r\n\r\nmany  persons  had  their  opportunities  limited\r\n\r\nthrough  no  fault of their own. In Singapore  we\r\n\r\nknow how circumscribed were the opportunities for\r\n\r\nuseful  careers open to those who did not receive\r\n\r\nan  English language education. We have also seen\r\n\r\nhow  the  P.A.P.  Government  has  brought  about\r\n\r\ngreater  and more equal opportunities  for  those\r\n\r\nwho  have been to the middle schools and  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A socialist government would not merely bring\r\n\r\nabout  equality  of opportunities between  groups\r\n\r\nand classes in the country. It would also try  to\r\n\r\nexpand  opportunities for all to  exercise  their\r\n\r\nabilities to the full for the benefit of society.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore  this  is  a  most  urgent  problem\r\n\r\nbecause  of our rapid population growth  and  the\r\n\r\nprospect of mounting unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A right wing government would view this not with\r\n\r\nalarm    but   with   delight.   For   increasing\r\n\r\nunemployment must sap the strength of the working\r\n\r\nclass  movement by reducing the bargaining  power\r\n\r\nof organised labour. When this happens then wages\r\n\r\nwill go down, exploitation of workers intensified\r\n\r\nand  profits  increase.  A Right-wing  government\r\n\r\nwould  therefore feel no urgency about  expanding\r\n\r\nthe    economy    and    increasing    employment\r\n\r\nopportunities through industrialisation. It  will\r\n\r\nleave the free play of economic forces to produce\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesired  adjustment, which will be to the benefit\r\n\r\nof employers and the detriment of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A socialist government, on the other hand, views\r\n\r\nthe  prospect  of  increasing  unemployment  with\r\n\r\ngrave  anxiety  and  will strain  itself  to  the\r\n\r\nutmost to avoid this situation. The expansion  of\r\n\r\nthe economy however means that money will have to\r\n\r\nbe  found  somehow  to finance  those  additional\r\n\r\neconomic  and industrial services and  facilities\r\n\r\nwhich are needed. A socialist government will get\r\n\r\nthe  money  through taxation in such a  way  that\r\n\r\nthose  who  can  afford to pay  taxes  share  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  responsibility.  Therefore  by   fiscal\r\n\r\nmeasures wealth is withdrawn from those  who  are\r\n\r\nbetter off and put to uses for the benefit of the\r\n\r\nwhole society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this can be done within the framework of\r\n\r\nprivate  ownership  of industry.  In  the  modern\r\n\r\nstate,  the instruments of regulation  that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  developed in so many countries have  become\r\n\r\nboth varied and refined. They can be used for any\r\n\r\nnumber of purposes according to the policy of the\r\n\r\ngovernment of the day. For instance, they can  be\r\n\r\nused  for the purpose of preparation for  war  in\r\n\r\nsupport of aggression against other countries. Or\r\n\r\nthey  may  be  designed to enrich those  who  are\r\n\r\nalready  rich and impoverish those who are  poor.\r\n\r\nOr they may be used both to increase the national\r\n\r\nwealth  and to redress gross inequalities in  its\r\n\r\ndistribution without at the same time  destroying\r\n\r\nthe  incentives  to effort and  enterprise  which\r\n\r\nsustain  the functioning of the system of private\r\n\r\nownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Review of Expenditure in 1960</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from this long but necessary\r\n\r\ndissertation on basic principles, I now  turn  to\r\n\r\nmore  mundane affairs. In fact I turn to a review\r\n\r\nof  Government expenditure and revenue  in  1960.\r\n\r\nThe  1960  Estimates were framed on the basis  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure being in the neighbourhood of  $275.3\r\n\r\nmillion  and revenue at $269.2 million. In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  there  would have been a  deficit  of  $6\r\n\r\nmillion to be paid from cash reserves during  the\r\n\r\nyear. In addition to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestimated  expenditure, the  Assembly  was  asked\r\n\r\nduring  1960, to approve Supplementary  Estimates\r\n\r\nof  $2.5 million, $200,000 of which was met  from\r\n\r\nsavings,  making a net additional expenditure  of\r\n\r\n$2.3   million.   Thus,   the   total   estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure for 1960 was $277.8 million  and  the\r\n\r\nestimated deficit was increased to $8.5  million.\r\n\r\nThis  sets the picture out in so far as Estimates\r\n\r\nare concerned. However, there is the question  of\r\n\r\nability to fulfil these Estimates and here  there\r\n\r\nis  some  doubt as to the possibility of spending\r\n\r\n$277  million this year. The main reason for this\r\n\r\ncan   be  said  to  be  that  the  machinery   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  in 1959 - in fact commencing  from  the\r\n\r\nlatter half of 1958 - was severely curtailed in its\r\n\r\nactivities  because  of restrictions  imposed  on\r\n\r\nexpenditure  due  to  the  decline  of   economic\r\n\r\nactivity  in  the  State  and  the  slight  world\r\n\r\nrecession in trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is evidenced by the total expenditure over\r\n\r\nthe  various quarters of the years concerned.  In\r\n\r\nthe  first quarter of 1959, total expenditure was\r\n\r\n$50.9  million;  for  the second  quarter,  $57.7\r\n\r\nmillion;  for  the third quarter, $52.0  million,\r\n\r\nand  for  the  fourth quarter, $54.6 million.  In\r\n\r\n1960, the downward trend continued but there  are\r\n\r\nnow signs of improvement. About $50.0 million was\r\n\r\nspent in the first quarter; $52.0 million in  the\r\n\r\nsecond  quarter;  $54.0  million  in  the   third\r\n\r\nquarter  and  it is estimated that $65.0  million\r\n\r\nexcluding  a  transfer  of  $20  million  to  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund would be spent  in  the  fourth\r\n\r\nquarter.  This, however, still gives a  shortfall\r\n\r\nof  about  $30  million on  the  total  budgetted\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also be noted that total expenditure\r\n\r\nnever  does  keep  up with the  Estimates,  there\r\n\r\nbeing time lags in payments, delays in fulfilling\r\n\r\norders,  difficulties of recruitment, or planning\r\n\r\nand  implementation problems. For instance,  from\r\n\r\n1950   to  1958,  total  expenditure  had   never\r\n\r\nexceeded  total  estimates except  in  1954  when\r\n\r\n$240.5 million was voted and $248.9 million spent\r\n\r\nand  it  was only in 1951 and 1952 that estimates\r\n\r\nwere nearly achieved by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactual  expenditure.  For the  rest,  expenditure\r\n\r\nfell  short  of  estimates and in 1955  and  1953\r\n\r\nunder-expenditure  was $32.8  million  and  $40.7\r\n\r\nmillion respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the general picture has been given. Now\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the details of under-expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe  following  is  an  indication,  Ministry  by\r\n\r\nMinistry, of under-expenditure against  the  1960\r\n\r\nEstimates.  The  Prime  Minister's  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nunderspent  to  the extent of $3.6  million.  The\r\n\r\nmain reason for this is the fact that Rural Board\r\n\r\nworks  on  roads and building constructions  have\r\n\r\nbeen  delayed by a lack of engineering staff.  In\r\n\r\naddition, about $1\u00bd million will not  be  spent\r\n\r\nby the Public Works Department because of lack of\r\n\r\nengineers and architects to supervise maintenance\r\n\r\nwork  for  which an estimate of $6.8 million  was\r\n\r\nmade  in  the Budget. Roughly only $5\u00bd  million\r\n\r\nwill  be  spent. In this connection, it  must  be\r\n\r\nstated that though every effort is being made  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  establishment  of  the  Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment   to   strength,   there   are   still\r\n\r\ndeficiencies  in a number of senior  posts  which\r\n\r\ncannot  be filled substantively since experienced\r\n\r\nmen  are  not available. The Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nwill  underspend to the extent of  $6.8  million.\r\n\r\nThe large under-expenditures occur under Personal\r\n\r\nEmoluments where it has been extremely  difficult\r\n\r\nto  recruit  professional  medical  officers  and\r\n\r\nspecialists and where there have been substantial\r\n\r\ndelays  in  recruiting and training of  ancillary\r\n\r\nstaff. Then, under Special Expenditure, there has\r\n\r\nbeen  a drop in Hospitals Board and Tan Tock Seng\r\n\r\nHospital's  expenditure because of the  shortages\r\n\r\nof staff referred to above. The Government is now\r\n\r\ntaking   action   to  recruit  overseas   trained\r\n\r\npersonnel to strengthen the establishment of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health and it is hoped  that  under\r\n\r\nthese conditions, the Ministry will be able fully\r\n\r\nto perform its functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministry of Finance, under-expenditure\r\n\r\nof  about  $7.4 million will occur in  1960,  the\r\n\r\nmain  reason  being that it was not necessary  to\r\n\r\nseek  loan  money  to  such  an  extent  as   was\r\n\r\nenvisaged.  $2 million therefore remains  unspent\r\n\r\non  account  of  the  Public Debt.  In  addition,\r\n\r\nPensions,   Retiring  Allowances  and  Gratuities\r\n\r\namounted to only $16.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion as against the estimate of $18.6 million,\r\n\r\nthere  being smaller pensions payable  than  have\r\n\r\nbeen   estimated   for,   thus   affecting   both\r\n\r\ncommutations of gratuities and rates of  pensions\r\n\r\npayable. Finally, it is estimated that because of\r\n\r\nstricter  controls  on  travelling  and  courses,\r\n\r\nfellowships  and scholarships abroad, expenditure\r\n\r\nunder  the  head \"Ministry of Finance\"  would  be\r\n\r\nsmaller than expected. There has also been  staff\r\n\r\nre-organisations so that it has been possible  to\r\n\r\nkeep  down  the  cost of the votes providing  for\r\n\r\nreplacement of officers under training, on  short\r\n\r\nleave,  sick  leave,  etc. There  has  been  some\r\n\r\nslight   under-expenditure  in  the  \r\n\r\nAccountant-General's  and  the  Inland  Revenue  Departments\r\n\r\ntotalling   roughly  $200,000   and   these   are\r\n\r\naccounted  almost completely for by the  shortage\r\n\r\nof personnel in Division I of the Public Service.\r\n\r\nWith  regard to the Ministry of Labour  and  Law,\r\n\r\nthere  will be a very small under-expenditure  of\r\n\r\nabout $\u00bd million and this is accountable almost\r\n\r\ncompletely  by  more  careful  administration  of\r\n\r\nresidential   institutions, community   centres,\r\n\r\ncreches as well as stricter investigation of  all\r\n\r\nclaims for public assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry of Culture, under-expenditure\r\n\r\nwill  be also very small, roughly $400,000.  This\r\n\r\nis  due  to under-expenditure in the Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDivision as well as the Printing Division because\r\n\r\nof a more careful distribution of work and better\r\n\r\nand  more  efficient organisation of  facilities.\r\n\r\nUnder  the Ministry of Home Affairs, about  $2\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion will not be spent. This is mainly due  to\r\n\r\nunder-expenditure on the Defence Services because\r\n\r\nof  the  abolition of the M.A.A.F. and delays  in\r\n\r\nrecruitment  and  problems of obtaining  seconded\r\n\r\npersonnel to the Singapore Military Forces.  Also\r\n\r\n$1.2  million will not be spent from Police votes\r\n\r\nbecause  of  vacancies  in  senior  appointments,\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  recruiting  constables  of  the\r\n\r\nhigher  standards  now laid down  and  delays  in\r\n\r\nfulfilling   requisitions   for   equipment   and\r\n\r\nfurnishings.  Finally, there will be  about  $5.3\r\n\r\nmillion  underspent  for  Education  because   of\r\n\r\ncontrols on grants-in-aid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npayments  and appointments of teachers  where  it\r\n\r\nhas   not  been  possible  to  recruit  qualified\r\n\r\npersonnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Revenue in 1960</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the principal items of revenue, income tax\r\n\r\nyield  is  estimated at $75 million for  1960  as\r\n\r\nagainst  the provisional estimate of $65  million\r\n\r\nat the beginning of the year. At the beginning of\r\n\r\nthe  year, it was expected that the slightly less\r\n\r\nfavourable  trading conditions  would  result  in\r\n\r\nlower  incomes and lower income tax  collections.\r\n\r\nThis  increase is attributable to more  energetic\r\n\r\nmeasures  being taken in following up assessments\r\n\r\nand ensuring speedy collection and the policy  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with the large assessments at once  leaving\r\n\r\nthe smaller assessments to later in the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against the estimated revenue of $43.1\r\n\r\nmillion   in   respect  of  tobacco   duty,   the\r\n\r\ncollections up to the end of October amounted  to\r\n\r\n$33.2  million and it is likely that the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe  year figures will show collections about  $3\r\n\r\nmillion below the original estimates. This is  in\r\n\r\nthe  main due to a change in consumer habits away\r\n\r\nfrom  foreign  imported brands of cigarettes  and\r\n\r\ntobacco  to  locally manufactured  products.  The\r\n\r\nrate  of duty on these is smaller. There was also\r\n\r\na  switch in use by manufacturers from cut rag to\r\n\r\ntobacco  leaf,  the rate of duty  on  the  latter\r\n\r\nbeing lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petroleum revenue was estimated at $40.4\r\n\r\nmillion.   Figures  for  the  first  ten   months\r\n\r\nindicate that the actual revenue will be  in  the\r\n\r\nregion  of  $38  million,  a  shortfall  of  $2.4\r\n\r\nmillion. This year's collection will, however, be\r\n\r\nhigher  than the actual revenue of $34.2  million\r\n\r\nin  1959.  The  revenue  estimates  will  not  be\r\n\r\nreached   partly   due  to   the   lower   petrol\r\n\r\nconsumption  of  smaller  cars  which  are   more\r\n\r\npopular   nowadays.  There  has  also   been   an\r\n\r\nincreasing  tendency  for taxis  to  switch  from\r\n\r\npetrol to diesel fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquor revenue was originally estimated at $23.5\r\n\r\nmillion  and  this  would probably  be  realised.\r\n\r\nThere has been an increase in demand for imported\r\n\r\nbeer at the expense of imported spirits and local\r\n\r\nbeer  but the overall production at the two local\r\n\r\nbreweries has exceeded the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprevious  year's figure. The anticipated  revenue\r\n\r\nof $7 million for Entertainment Duty this year is\r\n\r\nlikely to be achieved by the end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against an estimate of $4 million on taxes on\r\n\r\ntotalisators   and   sweepstakes,   the    actual\r\n\r\ncollections for the first ten months amounted  to\r\n\r\n$4.7  million  and  it  is anticipated  that  the\r\n\r\noriginal  estimate  will  be  exceeded  by   $1.2\r\n\r\nmillion   by   the   end   of   the   year.   The\r\n\r\nintensification  of  the war  on  bookmakers  has\r\n\r\nresulted  in higher takings on the tote,  thereby\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  amount payable to  the  revenue.\r\n\r\nStamp  Duty  was  estimated at $3.8  million  but\r\n\r\nthere  is  likely  to  be  a  shortfall  of  $\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion.  As against this, Estate Duty may  yield\r\n\r\nan  excess of $400,000 over the estimated  figure\r\n\r\nof $4 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Surplus for 1960</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main revenue sources I have mentioned will,\r\n\r\nin  the  aggregate,  achieve an  excess  of  $5.7\r\n\r\nmillion  as compared with the original estimates.\r\n\r\nThere was, in addition, a welcome addition to our\r\n\r\nfunds  which was not provided for last year.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Federation of Malaya agreed  to\r\n\r\ncommence  the  repayment of the $30 million  loan\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Singapore Government in 1954.  This\r\n\r\nrepayment  is not due until 1964 at the earliest.\r\n\r\nHowever,   in   view  of  the  extremely   strong\r\n\r\nfinancial  position of the Federation Government,\r\n\r\nwe  made  a request to them that the $30  million\r\n\r\nloan  be repaid earlier than scheduled, in  three\r\n\r\nannual  instalments  of  $10  million  each.  The\r\n\r\nFederation  Minister  of  Finance  took  a   very\r\n\r\nsympathetic view of our request which  was  based\r\n\r\non  our urgent need for development finance. I am\r\n\r\nsure  Members  will  join me  in  expressing  our\r\n\r\nappreciation of the sympathetic manner with which\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Government met our  request  for\r\n\r\nearly repayment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the accounting convention regulating\r\n\r\nGovernment accounts, which is conducted on a cash\r\n\r\nbasis,  the  $10  million capital  repayment  was\r\n\r\ncredited to the revenue account. This has enabled\r\n\r\nthe revenue to exceed the estimates by nearly $16\r\n\r\nmillion. The result of combined under-expenditure\r\n\r\nand  revenue  excess is that  the  year  1960  is\r\n\r\nlikely to end in a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubstantial  surplus of $37 million.  Expenditure\r\n\r\nshould stand at $248 million and revenue at  $285\r\n\r\nmillion.  Even  after  taking  into  account  the\r\n\r\ncapital  receipt of the loan repayment, a sizable\r\n\r\nsurplus still remains in the Ordinary Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as this surplus is the result of strict\r\n\r\ncontrol   of   expenditure   exercised   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the position is gratifying. But there\r\n\r\nis  another reason for under-expenditure which is\r\n\r\nless   welcome.   This  is   the   inability   of\r\n\r\ndepartments  to realise their special expenditure\r\n\r\nitems.   Such  expenditure  requires   a   fairly\r\n\r\nprolonged  period  of preparation  and  planning.\r\n\r\nThis  is  especially  true  of  public  work  and\r\n\r\nconstruction.   Owing   to   the   shortages   of\r\n\r\nEngineers,   Architects,  Surveyors   and   other\r\n\r\ntechnical  staff, much of this construction  work\r\n\r\ncould not be initiated early enough this year for\r\n\r\ncompletion and payment during the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bottlenecks to expenditure have, as I\r\n\r\nstated before, given grounds for anxiety.  It  is\r\n\r\napparent that there must be a review of policy in\r\n\r\nregard  to  methods of preparation, planning  and\r\n\r\nsupervision    of    special   expenditure    and\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects. The Government has  already\r\n\r\nset  up a Commission to enquire into the capacity\r\n\r\nof   the  building  trade.  This  Commission  has\r\n\r\nsubmitted its preliminary findings and has made a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  valuable proposals in regard  to  the\r\n\r\norganisation of Government Departments  concerned\r\n\r\nin  building  and construction. These  are  under\r\n\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to strengthen the\r\n\r\ntechnical   personnel   of   the   Public   Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  by  recruitment  or  secondment  from\r\n\r\noverseas  countries.  We are holding  discussions\r\n\r\nwith  the United Kingdom Commission, Commonwealth\r\n\r\nand  consular representatives of various overseas\r\n\r\ngovernments  to obtain their assistance  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter. The first result of this policy has  come\r\n\r\nto light only a few days ago. Last week a team of\r\n\r\nsix  Japanese  Engineers and Industrial  Planners\r\n\r\narrived in Singapore. These were appointed by the\r\n\r\nJapanese  Government,  at  the  request  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government for assistance in making\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphysical plans for the Jurong Industrial  Estate.\r\n\r\nIt  is likely that we shall make use of technical\r\n\r\nassistance  of this kind from overseas  countries\r\n\r\nfor  several of the major projects entered in our\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Plan.   The  Government   is   also\r\n\r\nconsidering other methods whereby our shortage of\r\n\r\nexperienced  technical  staff  may  be  overcome.\r\n\r\nThere is the possibility of more extensive use of\r\n\r\nConsulting  Engineers and  the  adoption  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem  of  international tenders for design  and\r\n\r\nconstruction for major projects. By such methods,\r\n\r\nit  is  hoped  that  the  substantial  volume  of\r\n\r\nconstruction  work,  which  will   have   to   be\r\n\r\nundertaken  in  the  next  four  years,  can   be\r\n\r\nsuccessfully undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>The 1961 Expenditure Estimates</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the 1961 Estimates. First\r\n\r\nthe   Ordinary  Expenditure.  By  far  the   most\r\n\r\nimportant  feature  of the  1961  Budget  is  the\r\n\r\ninclusion  within it of monies for Government  to\r\n\r\nundertake all functions, other than those of  the\r\n\r\npublic  utilities  now  performed  by  the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  In the People's Action Party manifesto,\r\n\r\nthe   intention  of  abolishing  the  politically\r\n\r\nseparate  entities of the City Council and  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard has been stated as one of the planks of the\r\n\r\nParty   platform.  Over  the  past   12   months,\r\n\r\ntherefore, administrative arrangements have  been\r\n\r\ngradually unfolding to provide for the absorption\r\n\r\nof  the local government functions into those  of\r\n\r\nthe  State. It is now possible to take the  final\r\n\r\nstep  which will completely merge in all respects\r\n\r\nthese  organisations into the Central Government.\r\n\r\nThe  Budget has, therefore, been framed  on  this\r\n\r\nbasis  and  in  1961 all monies  payable  to  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal Consolidated Rate Fund will now come to\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  except for  those  specifically\r\n\r\nallocated  to  the public utilities functions  of\r\n\r\nthe City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Rural Board, the procedure is\r\n\r\nmuch   simpler  since  Government  financed   the\r\n\r\ndifference  between  revenue and  expenditure  by\r\n\r\nmeans  of an annual contribution and it has meant\r\n\r\namalgamating physically the Rural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard   estimates   into  those   of   Government\r\n\r\nDepartments  which  will  undertake   its   work.\r\n\r\nFollowing on this, all the facilities provided by\r\n\r\nthe  City Council and Rural Board have got to  be\r\n\r\nundertaken  by  Government.  Wherever   possible,\r\n\r\nsimilar facilities undertaken by Government  have\r\n\r\nbeen reorganised or expanded to take into account\r\n\r\nnew undertakings in the city and rural areas.  It\r\n\r\nhas  resulted, in some instances, in considerable\r\n\r\nsavings in expenditure due to the possibility  of\r\n\r\nremoving  duplication or, in  some  instances,  a\r\n\r\nslight expansion of Government facilities with  a\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of  the cost of the Local  Government\r\n\r\nfunction.    However,   certain    administrative\r\n\r\ndifficulties  are  bound to arise,  the  main  of\r\n\r\nwhich   are  those  relating  to  personnel   and\r\n\r\nfinance.  There  are the problems of  maintaining\r\n\r\nthe  same  status  and terms  and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice  of  City  Council employees  within  the\r\n\r\nGovernment framework. Since about 8,000 employees\r\n\r\nare   concerned,  this  is  a  question  of  some\r\n\r\nmagnitude.  However, there have been  established\r\n\r\nworking  parties  to go into these  problems  and\r\n\r\ntheir    reports   which   take   into    account\r\n\r\norganisational  and  establishment   aspects   of\r\n\r\nintegration with regard to staff matters are  now\r\n\r\nunder  consideration by Government.  Negotiations\r\n\r\nwill   commence   with   the   respective   staff\r\n\r\nassociations  to work out an equitable  means  of\r\n\r\nabsorption   of   City  Council  employees   into\r\n\r\nGovernment.  There  is  no  intention  to  reduce\r\n\r\nsalaries, retrench staff or generally vary  terms\r\n\r\nand  conditions  of  service.  However,  a  large\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  \"give  and take\" will  be  necessary\r\n\r\nsince  two  relatively  separate  structures  are\r\n\r\nbeing   interwoven  into  a  pattern  of  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  organisation. On the financial  side,\r\n\r\nthe   main  problems  are  what  one  would  call\r\n\r\n\"accounting  difficulties\". The City Council  has\r\n\r\nrun  its budget on an accrual basis, i.e., income\r\n\r\nand  expenditure were the basis of the accounting\r\n\r\nsystem. Government, however, runs its accounts on\r\n\r\na  cash  basis and frames its budget on  receipts\r\n\r\nand   payments.   The  two  systems   are   quite\r\n\r\nincompatible and it has been necessary to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  a  number  of  accounting  adjustments   to\r\n\r\nprovide  for the gradual transfer of the  accrual\r\n\r\nto  the  cash basis. Fortunately, in this respect\r\n\r\nthere  has been time and with the advice of three\r\n\r\nexperts loaned by the Canadian Government, it has\r\n\r\nbeen possible to devise a satisfactory compromise\r\n\r\nwhich  will  come  into  operation  on  the   1st\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1961. It will be possible therefore  to\r\n\r\noperate a Budget which takes into account the new\r\n\r\nIntegrated Departments though still acknowledging\r\n\r\nthat certain procedures will have to be continued\r\n\r\nwith the City Council techniques. There will, for\r\n\r\ninstance,  have  to  remain  the  entity   of   a\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Provident Fund and contributions  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  continue until such time as an amicable\r\n\r\nand  workable arrangement has been resolved  with\r\n\r\nregard  to the retiring benefits of City  Council\r\n\r\nemployees. However, it is hoped that during  1961\r\n\r\nmost  of  these problems will have been  resolved\r\n\r\nand   consolidation  of  the   local   government\r\n\r\nfunctions into the Central Government sphere will\r\n\r\nbe accomplished in time for the 1962 Budget which\r\n\r\ncould  be  in  all  senses a  Central  Government\r\n\r\nBudget of the State of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the integration of the Local\r\n\r\nGovernments into the Central Government. Now  for\r\n\r\nthe  more  specific increases in  expenditure  on\r\n\r\naccount  of Government Departments in  1961.  The\r\n\r\ntotal  estimated expenditure for  what  could  be\r\n\r\ncalled  \"Government Departments\" will  be  $308.5\r\n\r\nmillion,  an increase of $33.2 million  over  the 1960 Estimates.  By  far the  largest  and  most\r\n\r\nimportant  increases  have  occurred  under   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health ($6.5 million), the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance  ($16.8  million),  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour and Law ($4.5 million) and the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation ($2.8 million). The large increases  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health are due to two  important\r\n\r\nchanges in the Budget. The first is the necessity\r\n\r\nto  provide  in  the  Budget now  for  Hospitals'\r\n\r\nBoard's  expenditure and the expenditure formerly\r\n\r\nincurred   by   the   Tan  Tock   Seng   Hospital\r\n\r\nCorporation. Both these organisations  have  been\r\n\r\nabolished   and  the  Ministry  of   Health   now\r\n\r\nundertakes the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirect  administration of the two  organisations.\r\n\r\nThe  reasons for this have already been explained\r\n\r\nand   could   be  summarised  in  one   word   as\r\n\r\n\"organisational\" though also the question of  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for health services  resting  with\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Health  and  not  with  these\r\n\r\nindependent organisations was also another  valid\r\n\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue and expenditure of these two bodies\r\n\r\nwill  now  be part of the Government account.  An\r\n\r\naddition  of roughly $3 million which was  before\r\n\r\nfound  from  the Hospitals Board's and  Tan  Tock\r\n\r\nSeng  Hospital  revenue  will  now  have  to   be\r\n\r\nprovided  as expenditure from Government  because\r\n\r\nthese  revenues  will be paid straight  into  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated  Fund and cannot be  netted  against\r\n\r\nexpenditure. In addition, there has also been  an\r\n\r\nincrease    in   estimated   Hospitals    Board's\r\n\r\nexpenditure  by about $3 million  for  1961.  The\r\n\r\nsame  procedure would have to be applied for  Tan\r\n\r\nTock Seng Hospital where the whole expenditure is\r\n\r\nnow shown under the Ministry of Health though  in\r\n\r\nfact here the increase is much smaller since only\r\n\r\n$100,000  or  so  of  Tan  Tock  Seng  Hospital's\r\n\r\nrevenue has got to be met from Government  funds.\r\n\r\nThere   is   also   an  increase   in   estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure on personal emoluments by about $2\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion because of the increase in nursing  staff\r\n\r\nand  ancillary medical workers, the total  number\r\n\r\nof  new posts being roughly 300. There have  been\r\n\r\nrelatively  small  increases in the  professional\r\n\r\ngrades  since  it  is proposed to  fill  existing\r\n\r\nvacancies before new posts are created. The total\r\n\r\nnumber of Divisions I and II new posts is 50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large increase in the Ministry of Finance is\r\n\r\ndue   to   two  factors:  one  is  the  increased\r\n\r\ncontribution   of   $10   million   towards   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund. As stated before in the revenue\r\n\r\nestimates,  there is expected to be a payment  of\r\n\r\n$10  million by the Federation of Malaya  towards\r\n\r\nrepayment of the $30 million loan made to  it  by\r\n\r\nSingapore in 1954. There has been a first payment\r\n\r\nof  $10  million this year and there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nfinal  payment  of $10 million  in  1962.  It  is\r\n\r\nessential that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat is virtually a capital payment should not be\r\n\r\ndissipated  on  recurrent  expenditure.  However,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the limitations of the Constitution,\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary that this windfall  payment  be\r\n\r\nmade  direct into the Consolidated Fund. The only\r\n\r\nway to transfer it out to the Development Fund is\r\n\r\nby  means of the Contribution towards Development\r\n\r\nvote   under  the  Ministry  of  Finance  or   by\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Estimates  under  the  Development\r\n\r\nFund    Ordinance,   both   ways   are    legally\r\n\r\npermissible.  It  is  therefore  felt  that   the\r\n\r\nContribution towards Development under  Head  28,\r\n\r\nSubhead  53 of the Ordinary Estimates  should  be\r\n\r\nincreased  from  the normal $20  million  to  $30\r\n\r\nmillion.  This is an indication of the importance\r\n\r\nGovernment attaches to the expansion of  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment and industrialisation of  the  State.\r\n\r\nThe  other increases are due to $2 million  being\r\n\r\nprovided  as  an Advance Account  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nPubic  Works Department to make forward purchases\r\n\r\nfor  the  integrated City Engineer's  Department;\r\n\r\n$2.8  million for the Public Debt and $2  million\r\n\r\nfor Pensions, Retirement Allowances, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another significant increase in the Estimates is\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Labour and Law's  provision  of\r\n\r\n$3\u00bd  million  for  the  Work  Brigade  and  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court. The  functions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Brigade have also been explained  when\r\n\r\nthe  1960 Budget was introduced in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nMembers  were told of the provision of $7 million\r\n\r\nas  unemployment  relief  works  to  be  executed\r\n\r\nthrough the Work Brigade. Already a large  number\r\n\r\nof  labour  intensive projects have started.  The\r\n\r\nestablishment  of camps has already  taken  place\r\n\r\nand  recruitment and training of the  Brigade  is\r\n\r\ntaking  place. There is now available a  core  of\r\n\r\nexperienced  and hardworking personnel  available\r\n\r\nto  Government  to  undertake some  of  the  more\r\n\r\nintensive  labour  projects  of  the  development\r\n\r\nprogramme. A Director has recently been appointed\r\n\r\nwho  will now co-ordinate the administrative  and\r\n\r\ntechnical aspects of the Brigade. It is no longer\r\n\r\nfelt that the provision for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Work  Brigade  should  be  regarded  as   a\r\n\r\ndevelopmental   expenditure  and  therefore   the\r\n\r\nmonies   are  being  provided  in  the   ordinary\r\n\r\nEstimates    under   the   Ministry    for    the\r\n\r\nadministration of the Brigade and expenditure  on\r\n\r\nits projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very significant development is the\r\n\r\nestablishment   of  the  Industrial   Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt.  The  Court has already begun to  function\r\n\r\nand  in  time will take its place as one  of  the\r\n\r\nmajor  pillars  of the State ensuring  industrial\r\n\r\npeace  with justice. The total cost is  estimated\r\n\r\nat about $100,000. Then there will be an increase\r\n\r\nof  about  $1 million for expenditure  on  public\r\n\r\nassistance and the development and integration of\r\n\r\ncommunity  associations. The latter is now  being\r\n\r\nfirmly  pursued through the People's Association.\r\n\r\nA  large  number of community centres  have  been\r\n\r\nbuilt  and  work  on  providing  integration  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment is being pushed ahead. With regard to\r\n\r\npublic  assistance, with the  improved  tempo  of\r\n\r\neconomic  activity in the State and more  careful\r\n\r\nscrutiny and investigation of claims, it will  be\r\n\r\npossible  to  keep expenditure within  reasonable\r\n\r\nbounds  and  therefore only a small  increase  is\r\n\r\ncontemplated  for  1961. Finally,  there  is  the\r\n\r\nlarge  increase of the Ministry of  Education  of\r\n\r\n$2.8  million  for  new  posts  of  teachers  and\r\n\r\nexpansion of educational facilities in the State.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be  seen that about 880 new  posts  are\r\n\r\nbeing  provided to the Ministry and  the  largest\r\n\r\nnumber  of  these will be about 680  teachers  in\r\n\r\nDivision  II. The next largest increase  will  be\r\n\r\nancillary  staff  to maintain and  upkeep  school\r\n\r\ncompounds   and  buildings.  In  all  about   150\r\n\r\nDivision  IV  employees will  be  appointed  next\r\n\r\nyear. Other significant developments are the sums\r\n\r\nof    money   provided   for   scholarships   and\r\n\r\nfellowships  and  over $1 million  more  for  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Malaya.  There  will  be  further\r\n\r\nincreases  to provide for more science facilities\r\n\r\nand teaching equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen, therefore, that 1961 will be a\r\n\r\nyear  of  considerable  expansion  in  the  basic\r\n\r\nfacilities provided to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic,  both in the economic and social spheres.\r\n\r\nIt  will be a year when more rational expenditure\r\n\r\nof  public funds should occur. It will also be  a\r\n\r\nyear  when  larger  calls will  be  made  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  machinery to expand and  develop  the\r\n\r\nalready  existing facilities. It will be  a  year\r\n\r\nwhen Government itself will have to carry the new\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of  providing  the   facilities\r\n\r\nwhich  were  previously  provided  by  the  local\r\n\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Development Plan</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first draft of the Development Plan was\r\n\r\ncompleted  in  June this year  and  some  of  the\r\n\r\ndetails  had  been  published.  Since  then,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  has  approached  the  U.K.\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  World  Bank  for  financial\r\n\r\nassistance in financing the Development Plan. The\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank  sent its mission to  Singapore  last\r\n\r\nmonth.  The results of discussions with the  U.K.\r\n\r\nGovernment are known. Though the amount  that  we\r\n\r\nobtained by way of assistance in loans and grants\r\n\r\nis  not as much as we had hoped for, nevertheless\r\n\r\nthis would be a useful addition to our resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been my intention to publish the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan at about the same time  as  the\r\n\r\nEstimates. Unfortunately, circumstances prevented\r\n\r\nthis.  It was necessary to amend the Plan in  the\r\n\r\nlight  of  discussions with the World  Bank,  the\r\n\r\nU.K.  Government and the U.N. experts.  The  work\r\n\r\ninvolved   in   making   these   amendments   and\r\n\r\nadjustments  throughout  the  Plan  to   preserve\r\n\r\nconsistency  is both intricate and  considerable.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, the staff engaged in this work\r\n\r\nhad to meet many other urgent calls on their time\r\n\r\nsuch  as  preparing material for the U.N. experts\r\n\r\nand  the  World  Bank  team and  arranging  their\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  work in Singapore  so  that  their\r\n\r\nexpertise  and energies may be used to  the  best\r\n\r\nadvantage  in the short time they are  here.  The\r\n\r\nresult has been a delay in finalising the details\r\n\r\nof the Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to emphasize that the Plan itself deals\r\n\r\nonly  with capital expenditure by the Government\r\n\r\nand  public  authorities,  such  as  the  Trading\r\n\r\nDepartments  of the City Council,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard, the Singapore Telephone Board and the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board.  It  does not take  into  account\r\n\r\ncapital outlays in the private sector, for these,\r\n\r\nby  and  large,  are  something  that  cannot  be\r\n\r\nforecast with any accuracy in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the capital outlays by the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  concerned, the details  for  the\r\n\r\nperiod   1961-1964  appear  in  the   Development\r\n\r\nEstimates.  Both  the expenditures  provided  for\r\n\r\n1961  and  the  costs of completed  projects  are\r\n\r\nentered  in the Development Estimates. I wish  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  that,  in  many instances,  the  total\r\n\r\ncosts  are provisional estimates and are  subject\r\n\r\nto   revision.  Further,  in  the  light  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial position in the years to come,  it  may\r\n\r\nbe   necessary  to  revise  either  by   way   of\r\n\r\namendment,  deletion  or  addition  the   capital\r\n\r\noutlays entered in the Estimates. The Development\r\n\r\nPlan,  therefore,  is not a  rigid  programme  of\r\n\r\ncapital  expenditure  but  objectives  which   we\r\n\r\nthink, in the light of present circumstances, are\r\n\r\nattainable  and desirable. They do not constitute\r\n\r\nauthority  for  expenditure and, as  I  mentioned\r\n\r\nbefore,  revisions will be made to the Plan  from\r\n\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention here to go into the\r\n\r\ndetails of this Plan. When the report on the Plan\r\n\r\nis  published,  which I expect to be  early  next\r\n\r\nyear,  the  public will be able to  know  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat we want to do, why we want to do it and what\r\n\r\nwe expect to result from the Plan. But some broad\r\n\r\nindications  of the magnitude of expenditure  may\r\n\r\nbe usefully made here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total capital expenditure for the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment is envisaged at $746.8 million for the\r\n\r\nyears  1961-64.  Of this, my own Ministry  claims\r\n\r\nthe  largest share, $194.2 million. This consists\r\n\r\nof  $100  million  for  the Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  and  $93.7  million  for  developing   the\r\n\r\nindustrial site in Jurong, reclaiming land in the\r\n\r\nKallang Swamp and other minor items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major item of capital development is\r\n\r\nin public housing and no less than $203.1 million\r\n\r\nhas  been  provisionally allotted to the  Housing\r\n\r\nand Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social services have staked their claims on our\r\n\r\ncapital  resources  and both  the  Ministries  of\r\n\r\nEducation   and   Health   have   been   allotted\r\n\r\nconsiderable sums, more than $100 million between\r\n\r\nthem - for   the   construction  of  new   schools,\r\n\r\nhospitals, clinics and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the expenditures of the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment, the Trading Departments of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil - soon  to  be  integrated  into  a  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board - have been allotted $147  million\r\n\r\nfor   the  expansion  of  public  utilities.  The\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board  has  in the course  of  execution\r\n\r\ncapital expansion works which will amount to  $18\r\n\r\nmillion,  while  the  Telephone  Board  plans  to\r\n\r\nexpand  its services by $17.5 million. The  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure during 1961-64 therefore  amounts  to\r\n\r\n$929.2  million.  It is expected,  however,  that\r\n\r\nsome  of  these  projects will not  be  completed\r\n\r\nduring  the Plan period and a reduction of  $53.0\r\n\r\nmillion   is   being  allowed  for.   There   is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, a balance of $876.2 million  that  has\r\n\r\nto  be  provided  by  way of  revenue  surpluses,\r\n\r\nadditional revenue, domestic loans and loans from\r\n\r\noverseas.  It is not my intention here  to  enter\r\n\r\ninto  the  details of how a development programme\r\n\r\nof  this magnitude will be financed. I only  want\r\n\r\nto  develop two points. The first is what we hope\r\n\r\nto  achieve by the development programme,  and  I\r\n\r\nalso want to say something about the burden which\r\n\r\nthe  citizens  of  this  country  would  have  to\r\n\r\nshoulder  to provide the resources to  carry  out\r\n\r\nthe Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal objective of the Plan is to\r\n\r\npromote  a  sustained growth of the  economy,  in\r\n\r\nparticular to bring about industrial expansion at\r\n\r\nan  accelerated rate. Thus, special attention  is\r\n\r\nbeing paid to providing what is commonly known as\r\n\r\nthe industrial infra-structure. This consists  of\r\n\r\nthe  building of better communications,  such  as\r\n\r\nsea   ports,   roads,  airports,  railways,   the\r\n\r\nprovision of ample and cheap power and industrial\r\n\r\nwater,  and  the  development  of  an  industrial\r\n\r\nestate  of  adequate size with all the facilities\r\n\r\nfor  the  transportation  and  marketing  of  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials  and finished products.  In  this  way,\r\n\r\ncapital expenditures of the Government would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninduce   and  encourage  investment  of   private\r\n\r\ncapital  both from local and overseas sources.  I\r\n\r\nhave  already referred to the rate of  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion  now going on. If we have  achieved  so\r\n\r\nmuch  with so little effort, there is every  hope\r\n\r\nthat   if   we   increase  the  inducements   and\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  private capital  investment,  we\r\n\r\nhave  every chance to achieve a sufficiently high\r\n\r\nrate  of  growth to provide work for our  growing\r\n\r\npopulation. Our present rate of industrial growth\r\n\r\ndemonstrates  that there are ample  opportunities\r\n\r\nin Singapore and that there are persons with both\r\n\r\ncapital  and enterprise who are prepared to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  these opportunities. This is one of  our\r\n\r\nstrongest  assets which we should  cultivate  and\r\n\r\nencourage with care and attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Revenue Proposals</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hardly necessary for me to explain that\r\n\r\nthe  State  will  not be able to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment programme on a scale that we  planned\r\n\r\nwithout further increases in revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained that, in part, the\r\n\r\nsurplus  was  due to the inability of departments\r\n\r\nto  implement development projects for this  year\r\n\r\nto the extent that had been allowed for. With the\r\n\r\nmeasures  that we have in mind and which  I  have\r\n\r\ndescribed, to strengthen the technical  personnel\r\n\r\nin  Government,  this  administrative  bottleneck\r\n\r\nwill  be reduced and finally eliminated. Further,\r\n\r\nthe   surplus  in  Government  accounts  can   be\r\n\r\nmisleading,  because  of the  separation  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary    Estimates   from   the    Development\r\n\r\nEstimates.  If  we take both estimates  together,\r\n\r\nthe  picture is less attractive. Indeed,  in  the\r\n\r\nyears   to   come  when  development  expenditure\r\n\r\ngathers  momentum, it is likely to  be  the  case\r\n\r\nthat our financial resources will be strained  to\r\n\r\nthe utmost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In planning for the future, we cannot work on an\r\n\r\nannual  basis, but must have regard to the  total\r\n\r\nperiod  of the Development Plan. In this respect,\r\n\r\nthe  calculation of available financial resources\r\n\r\nagainst  anticipated expenditure  will  leave  no\r\n\r\nroom for complacency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  the next four years the total expenditure  on\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is estimated at $876.0 million.  The\r\n\r\namount  of  money  we can raise  internally  from\r\n\r\nloans,     profits    of    public     utilities,\r\n\r\nappropriations from the revenue and running  down\r\n\r\nof  reserves  will  provide  no  more  than  $500\r\n\r\nmillion.  About  half this sum will  be  provided\r\n\r\nfrom  appropriations  from  the  revenue  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government and from the trading  profits\r\n\r\nof  public  utilities. The  other  half  will  be\r\n\r\nfinanced through loans, both long term and  short\r\n\r\nterm,  which the Government proposes to float  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. A substantial part of these loans will\r\n\r\nbe  taken  up by the Central Provident  Fund  but\r\n\r\nbanks, insurance companies and the general public\r\n\r\nare  expected to take up the rest. The  estimates\r\n\r\nof  available finance are based on current  rates\r\n\r\nof  taxation. A gap of $376 million remains to be\r\n\r\nfilled. Part of this, we expect, would come  from\r\n\r\nloans from overseas. We have been promised by the\r\n\r\nU.K.  Government a loan of $42.8 million. It  may\r\n\r\nbe  possible  to  borrow more.  There  are  other\r\n\r\nsources of finance available to us, such  as  the\r\n\r\nWorld   Bank,   the   International   Development\r\n\r\nAssociation,  trade  credits  from  suppliers  of\r\n\r\nequipment and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can hardly expect, however, for other\r\n\r\nGovernments,  the  World Bank  and  other  United\r\n\r\nNation agencies to consider our applications  for\r\n\r\nloans  in  a favourable light unless we ourselves\r\n\r\nhave  put  in  all  the effort possible  to  help\r\n\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is still one of the most lightly taxed\r\n\r\ncountries in the world. It is true that there are\r\n\r\nColonies,  such  as Hongkong, Sarawak  and  North\r\n\r\nBorneo, where taxation is even lighter, but if we\r\n\r\nlook  around in the developing countries of Asia,\r\n\r\nwe  will  find  that  their  taxation  rates  are\r\n\r\nincomparably  higher than ours. For instance,  in\r\n\r\nIndia  the rates of personal income tax go up  to\r\n\r\nas  high as 45 per cent in respect of income more\r\n\r\nthan  $15,000 per year together with a  surcharge\r\n\r\nof  5  per  cent and a supertax of 15  per  cent.\r\n\r\nAbove that there is the capital profits tax.  And\r\n\r\nthere  are import duties and sales tax on a large\r\n\r\nrange of goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In framing the new taxation proposals, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has four principal considerations  in\r\n\r\nview.  First, the new taxes should  be  borne  by\r\n\r\nthose  who are enjoying the largest benefit  from\r\n\r\nthe  expansion  of the economy. Next,  those  who\r\n\r\nhave been left out of the taxation orbit will  be\r\n\r\ncalled  upon to make their contribution. Thirdly,\r\n\r\nour taxation rates must have some relation to the\r\n\r\ntax   structure  in  the  Federation  of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nFinally,  taxes should influence the use  of  our\r\n\r\nscarce resources, especially land, in such a  way\r\n\r\nas  to promote maximum economic advantage for the\r\n\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these in mind, the following new taxes will\r\n\r\nbe introduced in the coming year:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Property Tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Business Registration Tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Stamp Duty on Import and Export Declarations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Increased assessment on Rubber Estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Increased rates on Private Lotteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Fees levied for the practice of certain\r\n\r\nprofessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Passenger tax on embarking air travellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Decrease in the rates of personal allowances\r\n\r\non  income  tax and increase in the  maximum\r\n\r\nrate of tax on personal income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Property Tax</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the integration of the City Council\r\n\r\nwith   the   Government,  the  Local   Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance  under which local rates are levied  on\r\n\r\nland  and  houses in the city will no  longer  be\r\n\r\nenforceable. Similarly, on the abolition  of  the\r\n\r\nRural Board, it will no longer be proper to  levy\r\n\r\nrates  in  the  rural  areas.  These  rates   are\r\n\r\nintended  to  finance services and  utilities  of\r\n\r\nequivalent  value from the revenue  so  obtained.\r\n\r\nWith  integration,  however, all  expenditure  is\r\n\r\nfinanced  from  the Consolidated  Fund,  so  that\r\n\r\nindividual  items of revenue lose their  identity\r\n\r\nin  the pooling into the Consolidated Fund,  from\r\n\r\nwhich all Government expenditure is met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To replace these rates, it will be necessary to\r\n\r\nintroduce a system of taxation. We will call this\r\n\r\nthe  property  tax. This is not  a  new  form  of\r\n\r\ntaxation  but  an amendment of existing  ones  to\r\n\r\nsuit  the changed circumstances. A Bill to  carry\r\n\r\nthem into effect has been introduced by me today.\r\n\r\nI  will  draw attention to some of the  principal\r\n\r\nfeatures of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the assessment of tax on properties, it is\r\n\r\nimportant that there must be some expectation  of\r\n\r\nstability  as regards rates of taxation  so  that\r\n\r\npersons, especially those intending to build  new\r\n\r\nhouses, can plan ahead in confidence. Hence it is\r\n\r\nproposed  that  the  rates levied  will  be  held\r\n\r\nconstant for a period of three years. In the city\r\n\r\narea, it is not proposed to make any increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  rates  on  property  tax  as  compared  with\r\n\r\nexisting local rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rural areas, however, increases will be\r\n\r\nmade depending on the extent to which these areas\r\n\r\nhave  been  enjoying  urban facilities,  such  as\r\n\r\nlighting,  water, roads, sewerage and  so  forth.\r\n\r\nThe  lower rates for the rural areas are a  relic\r\n\r\nof the past when large tracts of land outside the\r\n\r\ncity   awaited   development.  To   induce   such\r\n\r\ndevelopment, rates on property had been fixed  at\r\n\r\nvery  low  levels. No one can say that, with  the\r\n\r\nacute  pressure  on the land, we can  afford  the\r\n\r\nluxury  of low taxation rates in the rural areas.\r\n\r\nFurther  development  of  the  rural  areas  will\r\n\r\ndepend much more on the projects initiated by the\r\n\r\nGovernment than the unassisted effort of  private\r\n\r\nindividuals.  Accordingly, rates on property  tax\r\n\r\nin   the  rural  areas  will  increase  as   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of these areas proceeds apace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, proposed that property tax on\r\n\r\nindustrial establishments in the rural areas will\r\n\r\nnot  be  increased beyond the present rates.  The\r\n\r\nreason   for   providing   industry   with   this\r\n\r\ninducement is obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group of persons selected for favourable\r\n\r\ntreatment  are  owner occupiers of property.  The\r\n\r\npresent practice does not distinguish between the\r\n\r\nrates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplicable  to properties let out and  properties\r\n\r\noccupied by the owner. However, in the assessment\r\n\r\nof  annual values, owner-occupied properties  are\r\n\r\nassessed  on  favourable terms. This practice  is\r\n\r\nquite  irregular  and  I  propose  to  stop   it.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order not to penalise owner occupiers\r\n\r\nof  small  properties, the rates of  taxation  on\r\n\r\nthem will be fixed at less than the general rate.\r\n\r\nOwners  of  such properties are,  by  and  large,\r\n\r\npersons  of small means, who, by the exercise  of\r\n\r\nthrift, have come to acquire their own homes.  It\r\n\r\nis wrong that such persons should be penalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Business Registration Tax</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nintroduced  the  tax  on business  by  way  of  a\r\n\r\nregistration  fee  in  1953.  As  a   result   of\r\n\r\nsubsequent  opposition  by  a  section   of   the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community,  this tax  was  modified  in\r\n\r\n1956. The original registration fee was $100 to a\r\n\r\nmaximum of $300 per annum for businesses  in  the\r\n\r\ncities  and  $25  to  $75 for businesses  in  the\r\n\r\ncountryside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to levy the following rates of\r\n\r\nannual fees for businesses in Singapore:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                                     $ c.\r\n\r\n         Sole proprietorships in the city area      50.00                                          \r\n\r\n         Sole proprietorships in the rural area     12.50                       \r\n\r\n         Partnerships in the city area             100.00\r\n\r\n         Partnerships in the rural area             25.00\r\n\r\n         Public limited companies                1,000.00\r\n\r\n         Private limited companies                 750.00\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for introducing this form of taxation\r\n\r\nis   apparent.   A   large  majority   of   small\r\n\r\nshopkeepers do not contribute whatsoever  to  the\r\n\r\nInland Revenue. Further, if the proprietor  is  a\r\n\r\nman  of  abstemious  habits,  he  does  not  even\r\n\r\ncontribute to the liquor and tobacco tax.  If  he\r\n\r\nlives  in a shop premise, as is usually the case,\r\n\r\nhe  does  not own a motor car and hence does  not\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the petroleum duty.  Such  persons\r\n\r\nare   in  a  truly  privileged  position.   Their\r\n\r\nchildren receive education, the cost of which the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState  pays  up to 98 per cent or  more.  If  any\r\n\r\nmember  of his family falls ill, he can get  free\r\n\r\ntreatment  or  near  free  treatment   in   State\r\n\r\nhospitals  or dispensaries. Further,  they  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe full protection of law enforcement and public\r\n\r\norder.  It  is only equitable that he  be  called\r\n\r\nupon  to make a contribution towards the cost  of\r\n\r\nproviding these benefits. Nor can it be said that\r\n\r\nthe  rates  are  unduly high. Hawkers'  licensing\r\n\r\nfees  are  on  the average much higher  than  the\r\n\r\nrates we are levying on sole proprietorships  and\r\n\r\npartnerships.   The  yield  from  this   business\r\n\r\nregistration  fee is expected to  be  about  $2.0\r\n\r\nmillion per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA  duty  of  $1,000 per year on limited companies\r\n\r\ncan  hardly be regarded as excessive. As  against\r\n\r\nthe  unincorporated businesses, a limited company\r\n\r\nenjoys  substantial benefits by way of limitation\r\n\r\nof  the liability of shareholders. Most of  these\r\n\r\nconcerns  are  substantial  businesses  and  this\r\n\r\nadditional duty will bear lightly upon them.  The\r\n\r\ntax yield is expected to be $1.5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Stamp Duty on Import and Export Declarations</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hongkong, there is a system of taxation on\r\n\r\nevery declaration made by traders on imports  and\r\n\r\nexports of goods. The tax is HK$1 per form.  This\r\n\r\nseems to be an easy way of collecting money and I\r\n\r\npropose  to introduce a similar tax in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  yield is expected to be $500,000 a year.  It\r\n\r\ncannot   be   said  that  this  will  impose   an\r\n\r\nintolerable burden on the business community, nor\r\n\r\nwill this duty constitute an encroachment on  the\r\n\r\nfree  port status of Singapore. The sum is  small\r\n\r\nand  the  tax will be borne by large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Increased assessment on rubber estates</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present small holders pay an assessment of\r\n\r\n$8.00 (5 cents per tree) and a surcharge of $1.12\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  each acre of small  holding.  As\r\n\r\nregards the big estates, there is a tax which  at\r\n\r\npresent is 3\u00bc per cent ad valorem on the f.o.b.\r\n\r\nprice  of rubber and a surcharge of half  a  cent\r\n\r\nper  pound  for  rubber  research.  The  tax   is\r\n\r\nassessed  on  production  returns  submitted   by\r\n\r\nrubber\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestates  and  is levied under the Rubber  Estates\r\n\r\nAssessment Ordinance and the surcharge under  the\r\n\r\nRubber   Estates   (Surcharge)   Ordinance.   The\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya imposes a duty  on  rubber\r\n\r\nexported from the port of shipment. Part  of  the\r\n\r\nlevy  goes  towards research. A substantial  part\r\n\r\ngoes towards the replanting funds and there is an\r\n\r\nanti-inflationary cess which is steeply graduated\r\n\r\nwith respect to rubber prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to impose a similar export\r\n\r\nduty  in  Singapore because of the administrative\r\n\r\ndifficulties  stemming from  our  large  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  in  rubber. We are therefore proposing  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the rates of assessment on big holdings\r\n\r\nto  bring  them  approximately to  rates  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. The tax on estate production will  be\r\n\r\nrelated to the price of rubber. Commencing with a\r\n\r\nrate  of  3 per cent when the price is  under  60\r\n\r\ncents a lb., it will increase to 12 per cent when\r\n\r\nthe  price exceeds $1 per lb. There will be  a  1\r\n\r\nper  cent  increase  for  each  5  cent  platform\r\n\r\nbetween these limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rates of taxation are expected to equate\r\n\r\nto  rates prevailing in the Federation of  Malaya\r\n\r\nfor  similar prices of rubber. The present  rates\r\n\r\nof   taxation   on   rubber  in   Singapore   are\r\n\r\nconsiderably lower than those in the  Federation,\r\n\r\nespecially  at high prices of rubber. Considering\r\n\r\nthat land in Singapore can often be put to better\r\n\r\nuse  than  for  rubber plantations,  the  present\r\n\r\nrates of taxation are unrealistically low. It  is\r\n\r\nalso  proposed to increase the rate of assessment\r\n\r\non  small  holdings from the present 5 cents  per\r\n\r\ntree  to  15 cents per tree. This is the  maximum\r\n\r\nrate   provided   for  in  the   Rubber   Estates\r\n\r\nAssessment  Ordinance. At  this  new  rate  small\r\n\r\nholders  will be virtually paying tax at a  price\r\n\r\nof  rubber of 65 cents per lb. This is arrived at\r\n\r\non the basis of an average stand of 160 trees per\r\n\r\nacre producing about 250 lb, to the acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to discourage the use of land in rubber\r\n\r\nplanting in Singapore, it is proposed to  levy  a\r\n\r\ntax on land under immature rubber at the rate  of\r\n\r\n$35 per acre per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual increase in revenue from all these\r\n\r\nmeasures is estimated at $400,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Increased rates on Private Lotteries</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a machine in use in Singapore known as\r\n\r\nthe one-arm bandit. The purpose of the machine is\r\n\r\nto  ensnare optimistic persons to part with their\r\n\r\nmoney.  In  spite of the fact that the  odds  are\r\n\r\ngreatly against the player, the patronage of\r\n\r\none-arm  bandits increases year by year. In 1955, the\r\n\r\nGovernment proposed to tax these machines at  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  20 per cent on 150 per cent of the  net\r\n\r\ntakings. As a result of vociferous protests,  the\r\n\r\ntax was reduced to 20 per cent on 137 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe  net takings. It is now proposed that the tax\r\n\r\nshould  be  increased to 30 per cent on  137  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the net takings. Besides this there  is\r\n\r\nthe  matter of private sweepstakes. These  pay  a\r\n\r\nduty  of  20  per cent, while the Singapore  Turf\r\n\r\nClub  pays 30 per cent. There is no justification\r\n\r\nfor  this  discrimination and it is  proposed  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the rate on private sweepstakes  to  30\r\n\r\nper  cent.  The  additional  revenue  from  these\r\n\r\nmeasures is expected to be $150,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Fees levied on certain professions</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present rates of fees paid by professional\r\n\r\npersons  in  private practice are extremely  low.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, an advocate and solicitor pays  an\r\n\r\ninitial fee totalling $84 and a $50 annual fee, a\r\n\r\ndoctor   pays  an  annual  fee  of  $40  but   no\r\n\r\nregistration  fee, a dentist pays a  $20  initial\r\n\r\nfee and a $50 annual fee and a pharmacist pays  a\r\n\r\n$5  initial  fee  and a $20 annual  fee.  Neither\r\n\r\naccountants nor quantity surveyors, nor engineers\r\n\r\npay   any   registration  fee  or   annual   fee.\r\n\r\nArchitects  pay  an initial registration  fee  of\r\n\r\n$100 and an annual fee of $75 to their Board.  It\r\n\r\nis  time that the different treatment enjoyed  by\r\n\r\nvarious  professional  persons  be  placed  on  a\r\n\r\nrational  basis. It is proposed  that,  with  the\r\n\r\nexception   of   pharmacists,   all   the   above\r\n\r\ncategories  of  professional persons  in  private\r\n\r\npractice   be   required  to   pay   an   initial\r\n\r\nregistration fee of $250 and a quarterly  fee  of\r\n\r\n$125. For pharmacists,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe initial registration fee will be $100 and the\r\n\r\nquarterly fee $5. An additional revenue of  about\r\n\r\n$1   million   is   expected.  The   professional\r\n\r\nassociations have been consulted in regard to the\r\n\r\nlevy of these fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the justification for raising fees to\r\n\r\nthe  scales  proposed, apart from the tidying  up\r\n\r\neffect?  It  could  be argued  that  since  these\r\n\r\npersons  are in short supply, to require them  to\r\n\r\npay  additional fees would be contrary to  public\r\n\r\npolicy,   since  it  might  reduce   the   supply\r\n\r\nforthcoming. There might be some grounds for this\r\n\r\nargument if the fees proposed were penal, say, if\r\n\r\nthey  were  fixed at ten times the sums proposed.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  well-known fact that the  earnings  of\r\n\r\nprofessionals   in  private   practice   are   so\r\n\r\nsubstantial that the additional fees required  of\r\n\r\nthem  will  not  either  materially  reduce   the\r\n\r\nattractiveness  of  their  trade  or  impose   an\r\n\r\nintolerable  burden upon them.  The  argument  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of these fees rests on two points. First,\r\n\r\nwith  the  expansion  of the  economy  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  expenditure  is  intended  to   bring\r\n\r\nabout,  these professionals are likely  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nimmediate benefits much more than other  sections\r\n\r\nof the community. They have never had it so good;\r\n\r\nand  in the years to come they will have it  even\r\n\r\nbetter.  A small extra contribution from them  is\r\n\r\ntherefore not inequitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument rests on the disparity in\r\n\r\nincomes  between persons in private practice  and\r\n\r\nthose  in  the Government Service. This  is  only\r\n\r\npartially redressed by the higher income tax they\r\n\r\npay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Passenger tax on embarking air travellers</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all international airports in the world\r\n\r\ncharge  a  small  sum  on  embarking  passengers.\r\n\r\nSingapore   proposes  to  follow  this   sensible\r\n\r\npractice.  The  Government has borne  the  entire\r\n\r\nshare  in  the  maintenance of  services  at  the\r\n\r\nairport and a substantial part of its development\r\n\r\nexpenditure. It is only just that those  who  may\r\n\r\nuse  all these facilities contribute towards  the\r\n\r\ncost.  It is proposed, therefore, to levy a small\r\n\r\nfee  not  exceeding  ten dollars  in  respect  of\r\n\r\npassengers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nembarking on overseas flights and $1 per head for\r\n\r\nthose travelling to the Federation of Malaya  and\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo territories. Discussions will be held\r\n\r\nby the Director of Civil Aviation with interested\r\n\r\nparties. These sums are trivial in comparison  to\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  fares and there is  no  reason  to\r\n\r\nexpect  a  diminution in the  popularity  of  air\r\n\r\ntravel as a consequence. Transit passengers  will\r\n\r\nnot, of course, be charged this tax. A sum of  $1\r\n\r\nmillion is expected to be collected per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Decrease in the rates of personal allowances on\r\n\r\nincome tax and increase in the maximum rate of\r\n\r\ntax on personal income</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the Federation Government lowered the\r\n\r\npersonal allowances of an individual from  $3,000\r\n\r\nto  $2,000  and that for the wife from $2,000  to\r\n\r\n$1,000.  Bearing  in mind that income  tax  rates\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two territories should  not  differ\r\n\r\nsubstantially, it is proposed to follow the rates\r\n\r\nintroduced  by  the  Federation  last  year.  The\r\n\r\nFederation also increased the maximum rate of tax\r\n\r\non individuals by 5 per cent, from 40 per cent to\r\n\r\n45  per  cent. It is proposed to do  likewise  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and increase the maximum rate to 55 per\r\n\r\ncent on incomes above $100,000 per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limitation in the number of children\r\n\r\neligible for relief to four as against eight will\r\n\r\nnot be adopted and it is proposed to continue  to\r\n\r\ngive relief to children at the present rate up to\r\n\r\na maximum of eight children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While reducing the general rates of relief, I\r\n\r\npropose  to  introduce for  the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of tax payers a personal income  relief\r\n\r\nin  respect  of earned income. It is proposed  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  relief  of 20 per cent of earned  income\r\n\r\nsubject to a limit of $1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important innovation which we are\r\n\r\nmaking  in  our tax laws, that is to  distinguish\r\n\r\nbetween  income  earned as a result  of  personal\r\n\r\nexertions  and income accruing from the ownership\r\n\r\nof  property.  It  is only just and  proper  that\r\n\r\nincome  earned through the effort of one's  brain\r\n\r\nor  brawn  should  be  taxed  more  lightly  than\r\n\r\nproperty income. For\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe worker - be it through physical or intellectual\r\n\r\neffort  or  both - makes a current contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe  wealth  of  the nation, while the \r\n\r\nproperty-owner  lives off his past efforts or the  efforts\r\n\r\nof his ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me give some broad details of the\r\n\r\noperation  of  these changes.  The  reduction  of\r\n\r\npersonal  allowances means that more  people  are\r\n\r\nbrought  into the tax orbit. It also  means  that\r\n\r\nthose  who are already paying taxes have  to  pay\r\n\r\nhigher   rates.  But  the  earned  income  relief\r\n\r\ndiminishes  the impact of reductions of  personal\r\n\r\nreliefs, more particularly for those with smaller\r\n\r\nincomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, without earned income relief, a working\r\n\r\nbachelor earning more than $2,000 a year or  $170\r\n\r\nper  month  has to pay tax. Earned income  relief\r\n\r\nraises  the  minimum level to $2,400  a  year  as\r\n\r\nagainst  the present level of $3,000  a  year.  A\r\n\r\nmarried couple without children who would pay tax\r\n\r\nat  an  income  of $3,000 a year  without  earned\r\n\r\nincome  relief does not do so until their  income\r\n\r\nfrom work goes above $3,800 a year when their tax\r\n\r\nliability is only $2 per year. A family dependent\r\n\r\non  a worker with three children - and this is  the\r\n\r\naverage family in Singapore - does not have to  pay\r\n\r\ntax  until their income reaches $6,000 a year  or\r\n\r\n$500  per month. They then pay a tax of $12.50  a\r\n\r\nyear.  No one can say that the changes we propose\r\n\r\nto  the income tax structure imposes any hardship\r\n\r\nupon the poor or that we are asking any person to\r\n\r\npay tax that he cannot afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word about the extra yield of these new tax\r\n\r\nrates. People not paying tax but who would now be\r\n\r\nrequired  to do so would contribute an additional\r\n\r\n$\u00be  million  a year. Present tax  payers  would\r\n\r\ncontribute  the bulk of additional revenue,  that\r\n\r\nis  another  $3\u00bc  million, giving  an  expected\r\n\r\nincrease of $4 million a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional revenue from new taxes and\r\n\r\nchanges  in existing rates will amount  to  about\r\n\r\n$10.5 million. Perhaps some of those who will pay\r\n\r\nthese taxes may regard these additional calls  on\r\n\r\ntheir pockets as unnecessary impositions. But the\r\n\r\nadditional taxes, as all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxes  garnered  by  this  Government,  will   be\r\n\r\nreturned  to  the people in the form of  schools,\r\n\r\nhospitals,  new  industries, lighting  and  other\r\n\r\namenities.  Every cent collected from the  people\r\n\r\nwill be used to make life better for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people assume that the Government can\r\n\r\ncreate  out  of  thin  air the  money  needed  to\r\n\r\nprovide the many services the people demand.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment is not wealthy in its own right. It is\r\n\r\nnot  a private company of individuals but a  body\r\n\r\nof  men  elected by the people to perform certain\r\n\r\nduties. It has to pay for the many services it is\r\n\r\ncalled upon to do and the money for them must  be\r\n\r\nprovided  by  the people by way of taxes.  A  bad\r\n\r\ngovernment  will  dissipate  these  resources  by\r\n\r\nmismanagement  and corruption. A good  government\r\n\r\nwill see to it that the people get the best value\r\n\r\nfor their taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In distributing the burden of new taxes, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  as  a socialist Government, has  ensured\r\n\r\nthat  the taxes will be shared among many  people\r\n\r\nin  proportion to their ability to  pay.  Of  the\r\n\r\neight  tax increases, seven do not at all  affect\r\n\r\nthe lower income group. The proposals relating to\r\n\r\nincome  tax again fall very lightly on  the  wage\r\n\r\nearner. Of the $10.5 million new taxes only  $\u00be\r\n\r\nmillion will come directly from bachelors earning\r\n\r\nless  than  $310  a  month or an  average  family\r\n\r\nearning less than $500 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore taking the tax proposals broadly, it\r\n\r\ncan  be said that it is those who are better off,\r\n\r\nsuch  as air-travellers, shop-proprietors, import\r\n\r\nand   export  firms,  professionals  in   private\r\n\r\npractice,  who have been asked to  make  a  small\r\n\r\nextra  contribution  to the  cost  of  generating\r\n\r\nprosperity for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, care has been taken not to\r\n\r\nblunt  incentives to effort by the imposition  of\r\n\r\npenal rates of taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding my statement I wish to bring\r\n\r\nup  the  subject of variable allowances, a matter\r\n\r\nclosely   connected  with  the  previous  budget.\r\n\r\nMembers will recollect that certain reductions of\r\n\r\nthese  allowances  were made in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nupper  income  brackets in the Civil  Service.  A\r\n\r\nprofessional allowance ranging from $75  p.m. to\r\n\r\n$225  p.m. was subsequently introduced  to  keep\r\n\r\nGovernment   rates  of  pay  for  technical   and\r\n\r\nprofessional officers at a competitive  level  as\r\n\r\nagainst  pay rates in business. The justification\r\n\r\nfor the reduction of variable allowances lies  in\r\n\r\nthe  serious  financial  position  we  faced   on\r\n\r\nassuming office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the position is less grim, should not\r\n\r\nthe  Government reconsider its stand?  There  are\r\n\r\nmany factors to be considered. First, recruitment\r\n\r\nto  nearly all grades, except professional grades\r\n\r\nin  short supply, proceeds satisfactorily at  the\r\n\r\nrates  of pay we now offer. In the years to come,\r\n\r\nas  the increasing supply of students emerge from\r\n\r\nour  schools and universities, the Government  as\r\n\r\nan  employer will find it an even easier  job  of\r\n\r\nrecruiting  into the public service.  As  regards\r\n\r\nthe  professional  grades in short  supply,  they\r\n\r\ncannot be obtained from local sources in adequate\r\n\r\nnumbers  for some time whatever the pay,  and  we\r\n\r\nmust look overseas as we are now doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have to consider the additional taxes\r\n\r\nthat the public has to pay. It was the contention\r\n\r\nof  the  Staff  Side that the  cuts  in  variable\r\n\r\nallowances  were justified only  if  the  general\r\n\r\npublic was called upon to shoulder the burden  by\r\n\r\nfinancial stringency. With these new taxes,  this\r\n\r\nargument  of the Unions no longer holds good,  if\r\n\r\nindeed it ever held good at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two considerations therefore lead\r\n\r\nirresistibly to the conclusion that there  should\r\n\r\nbe  no  revision of rates of variable allowances.\r\n\r\nBut  the  fact  remains that the  Government  has\r\n\r\nsuccessfully ridden the financial troubles of the\r\n\r\nearly   days  and  it  must  therefore   make   a\r\n\r\nreappraisal  of the issue of variable allowances.\r\n\r\nI am therefore willing to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   negotiations  commenced  for   a   partial\r\n\r\nrestitution of the variable allowances. In  doing\r\n\r\nso,  may  I warn against undue optimism that  any\r\n\r\nlarge  scale raids into the public purse will  be\r\n\r\nallowed?  To restore variable allowances  to  the\r\n\r\nfull  would mean that practically the whole yield\r\n\r\nof  additional revenue would be eaten up  at  one\r\n\r\nfell stroke. The Treasury will not allow this to:\r\n\r\nhappen  and  it will have public opinion  on  its\r\n\r\nside. The Government employees cannot expect more\r\n\r\nthan  a  modest restoration of pay cuts. Further,\r\n\r\nas   the   quantum  is  one  that  has  extensive\r\n\r\nrepercussions on the financial structure  of  the\r\n\r\nState  and  its  capacity to finance  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure, the Government considers  that  this\r\n\r\nis  a matter of public policy and is not an issue\r\n\r\nthat  can be submitted to arbitration. With these\r\n\r\nprovisos,   I   welcome   the   commencement   of\r\n\r\nnegotiations  and will ask my Ministry  officials\r\n\r\nto invite the Staff Unions to start these soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It remains for me to express my appreciation of\r\n\r\nthe   various  officials  both  in  the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the City Council whose  sustained\r\n\r\nendeavours have resolved many intricate  problems\r\n\r\nor  financial integration to enable me to present\r\n\r\nthis first integrated set of Estimates of Revenue\r\n\r\nand   Expenditure.

P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\non the evening of the 17th of November this year,\r\n\r\nthe  Professor  of English at the  University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  delivered  an inaugural  lecture  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  \"Robert Graves and  the  Decline  of\r\n\r\nModernism\".  A  report of this  appeared  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times of Friday, the 18th.  This  report\r\n\r\ngave  the impression that the lecture was  mainly\r\n\r\ndirected at the Government on a matter of  policy\r\n\r\nin  which the Government was interested.  On  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  morning,  that  is,  Saturday,   there\r\n\r\nappeared in the Straits Times a letter purporting\r\n\r\nto  have been written by the Acting Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour   and  Law  to  the  Professor  concerned,\r\n\r\nstating in no uncertain terms what the Government\r\n\r\nthought  of  this  particular Professor  and  his\r\n\r\nlecture. So, Mr Speaker, Sir, on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday morning the public was able to read this\r\n\r\nletter  of  the Government which,  in  my  humble\r\n\r\nopinion, was couched in language quite unbecoming\r\n\r\nof   a  Minister.  On  reading  the  report,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, it seemed to me that three  issues\r\n\r\narose from that publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue is the question of academic\r\n\r\nfreedom  and the question of University autonomy,\r\n\r\nboth  matters being inextricably mixed  one  with\r\n\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue which seems to arise was the\r\n\r\nwording of that letter and the manner in which it\r\n\r\nwas  couched, and whether it was a kind of letter\r\n\r\nwhich  a  Government Minister  of  the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore should write to any person,  be  he  an\r\n\r\nalien or a citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue that seems to arise, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  was  the  proposition   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   that  aliens  in  Singapore - and   by\r\n\r\n\"aliens\"   the   Government  meant  non-Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens   or   non-Federal  citizens - should   be\r\n\r\npermitted   to   speak  on  matters   which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  thought were matters of  policy  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  political. Since then, the University\r\n\r\nof  Malaya Students Union have held a dinner, and\r\n\r\nevents   have  since  taken  place  between   the\r\n\r\npublication of that letter and today which  seems\r\n\r\nto  me  to  have satisfactorily disposed  of  the\r\n\r\nquestion   of  academic  freedom  and  University\r\n\r\nautonomy.  Apparently a modus operandi  has  been\r\n\r\narrived   at  between  the  Government  and   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Malaya; and the statement  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister assuring the University that there\r\n\r\nwas no intention of encroaching upon the academic\r\n\r\nfreedom or the autonomy of the University,  which\r\n\r\nI  was very gratified to note, disposes of what I\r\n\r\nthought  was  the  first issue when  I  read  the\r\n\r\nletter in the Straits Times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are two other issues which remain\r\n\r\nundisposed of, and it is on those two issues, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that I would like  to  say  a  few\r\n\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the trouble arose out of\r\n\r\nmatters  related to what is culture and  what  is\r\n\r\nnot  culture.  We are all fully  aware  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is embarking on a praiseworthy mission\r\n\r\nto  create  a  Malayan culture  out  of  all  the\r\n\r\ncultures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we now have here, and to give it a direction\r\n\r\nand  a  purpose;  and  out of that  direction  and\r\n\r\npurpose  to create something which will  be  ours,\r\n\r\nand  ours alone. A very praiseworthy mission! When\r\n\r\nsomebody  comments  on  it,  even  though  he  has\r\n\r\nviolated the rules of hospitality - shall I  put  it\r\n\r\nthat  way,  even if that is accepted, which  I  do\r\n\r\nnot - should  we,  as  a  Government,  address  that\r\n\r\nperson  in terms to say the least of it unbecoming\r\n\r\nof a Government? Terms like \"mendicant professors\"\r\n\r\nand  \"asinine remarks\" were used which,  I  think,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, would be unbecoming if they were\r\n\r\nused   in   this  Assembly.  What  more   when   a\r\n\r\nresponsible  Minister speaking for  the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  Mr Speaker, and not for  the  P.A.P.?\r\n\r\nWhat some of our Ministers do not understand,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in my humble view, is that they  are\r\n\r\nno  longer P.A.P. members when they write  letters\r\n\r\nas  Ministers  of the State. As Ministers  of  the\r\n\r\nState  they  belong to the State and  not  to  the\r\n\r\nParty.  If  our  Ministers would appreciate  that,\r\n\r\nthen  I think we would have gone a long way  along\r\n\r\nthe road to understanding what democratic concepts\r\n\r\nare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it right and becoming that a Minister should\r\n\r\nwrite such a letter on such an occasion couched in\r\n\r\nsuch  terms?  I think it was not. I see  that  the\r\n\r\nProfessor  concerned has sent in a letter  couched\r\n\r\nin  terms  acceptable to the Government.  In  this\r\n\r\nletter  the Professor has said that no slight  was\r\n\r\nintended.  I  have not seen any Government  letter\r\n\r\nyet  in  the  Press apologising for the  terms  in\r\n\r\nwhich  their first letter was couched. This letter\r\n\r\ntook  the fight far beyond the Professor  when  it\r\n\r\nincluded  the  phrase \"mendicant  professors\".  It\r\n\r\ntakes  in, with one fell swoop, all the Professors\r\n\r\nin  the  University who are either  not  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens or Federal citizens. Subject to what  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education has to say - and  he  is  an\r\n\r\nauthority on this subject - I understand at least 60\r\n\r\nto  70  per  cent  of the teaching  staff  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity, at least at the higher levels, are not\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens or Federal  citizens.  Anyway,\r\n\r\nthe  point is that quite a large proportion of the\r\n\r\nteaching  staff of the University are  non-Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens or non-Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens.  So,  in  carrying  the  fight  to  this\r\n\r\nProfessor  who,  in  the  Government's  view,  had\r\n\r\nerred,  they  took  the  fight  further  than  the\r\n\r\nProfessor  and,  if  I  may say  so,  gratuitously\r\n\r\ninsulted  the  rest of the teaching staff  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a young State setting out on quite a\r\n\r\nperilous  journey. We know that the  perils  which\r\n\r\nthe  State  is  facing  are  getting  greater  and\r\n\r\ngreater  from  day  to day. I  think  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister appreciates that, and I think most of our\r\n\r\nMinisters   are  beginning  to  appreciate   that.\r\n\r\nRunning   a  State  of  250  square  miles,   with\r\n\r\ndifficulties surrounding us all around, is not  an\r\n\r\neasy  matter.  We  have always  talked  about  the\r\n\r\ncreation of confidence. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  is\r\n\r\nno  way  to  create confidence  in  the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  A letter of this nature, I  dare  say,\r\n\r\nwould  have been wirelessed all round the academic\r\n\r\nworld.  We  are still going to the academic  world\r\n\r\noutside   for  recruitment.  The  Prime   Minister\r\n\r\nhimself has said that for years to come we have to\r\n\r\ngo  abroad to recruit teaching staff. Is this then\r\n\r\nthe  way  to  recruit  teaching  staff  abroad  by\r\n\r\ncalling   them  \"mendicant  professors  who   make\r\n\r\nasinine remarks\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, Sir, deals with aliens. It\r\n\r\nwould  appear  from the tone of  the  Government's\r\n\r\nrelease on the Prime Minister's statement that  if\r\n\r\nthe  statement complained of had been  made  by  a\r\n\r\nProfessor who was a Singapore citizen or a Federal\r\n\r\ncitizen,  then the Government would have taken  no\r\n\r\naction on it. This statement comes from the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  and I accept that statement. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  reach  the  position then that  any  alien  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  be  he a Professor or  otherwise,  who\r\n\r\ndabbles  in  politics  or makes  statements  which\r\n\r\nmight  relate  to  Singapore  politics,  will   be\r\n\r\nslapped  down.  If  that  is  the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment - perhaps they may be right - then I  think\r\n\r\nthey  should  see that that policy is  implemented\r\n\r\nfairly and squarely so far as all persons who make\r\n\r\nsuch  statements  in Singapore are  concerned.  Is\r\n\r\nthis  a  statement intended to apply only  to  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya; or is it intended  to  apply\r\n\r\nto all educational institutions in Singapore; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  it  intended  to  go  beyond  the  University\r\n\r\ncampuses  in Singapore and take in everybody  who\r\n\r\nis in Singapore and who happens to be an alien?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members will recollect several occasions\r\n\r\non  which  statements had been made by aliens  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   after  the  advent  of   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  which  had a direct  bearing  on  the\r\n\r\npolitics  and the policies of the Government.  In\r\n\r\nthose  cases, Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not  see  a\r\n\r\nquick  reply couched in strong, virile  terms  in\r\n\r\nthe  manner that the Government reacted  on  this\r\n\r\noccasion. This question can then be asked of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  - why  is  it  that  on   this\r\n\r\nparticular  occasion  they  reacted   with   such\r\n\r\nrapidity  when on other occasions they  had  kept\r\n\r\nquiet?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Prime Minister meant what he said, when\r\n\r\nhe said that no alien would be allowed to comment\r\n\r\non matters political, then that must equally well\r\n\r\napply  to  anybody who says anything  that  might\r\n\r\nhave  any relation to the political situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  be  it  good  or  bad.  Or   is   the\r\n\r\nGovernment only saying that they shall slap  down\r\n\r\nonly   those  people  who  criticise  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  and who thereby indulge in  politics?\r\n\r\nOr  are  the Government also saying that  anybody\r\n\r\nwho says anything about Singapore, be it good  or\r\n\r\nbad,  will be slapped down? If the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nsays  that no alien should interfere in politics,\r\n\r\nthen  he cannot restrict that statement by saying\r\n\r\nthat the Government will only slap down those who\r\n\r\ndare  to  criticise  them or who  make  slighting\r\n\r\nremarks  about them; but all the others who  have\r\n\r\ngood   things  to  say  about  them  are   passed\r\n\r\nunnoticed. And the first thing the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwill  realise  is that wherever there  is  power,\r\n\r\nthere  are  always sycophants hanging around  who\r\n\r\nwill  try to say nice things about the Government\r\n\r\nin  order to get on here. But I do not think that\r\n\r\nis  what  the Prime Minister means. I agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  Government, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there are\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  a  number  of  aliens  who   make\r\n\r\ngratuitous  statements about Singapore  politics,\r\n\r\nand  this  policy  of  the  Government  will   be\r\n\r\nsupported by us if they slap down every foreigner\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  dares to make a  statement  about\r\n\r\nSingapore politics. I think the time has now come\r\n\r\nwhen   aliens  must  keep  out  of  politics   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and if the Government mean  what  they\r\n\r\nsay, then I think they should slap down everybody\r\n\r\nwho dares to make such statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, the fact that the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park has chosen to raise this motion about\r\n\r\nGovernment  relations  with  the  University   of\r\n\r\nMalaya  when  the  case has already  been  closed\r\n\r\nwould  appear  as  if he has  taken  on  a  brief\r\n\r\nwithout  a client!

One is the nature  and\r\n\r\nterms  of the Government's letter which,  in  his\r\n\r\nopinion, was couched in very strong language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are times when it is\r\n\r\nnecessary   to   say  things  in  rather   strong\r\n\r\nlanguage.  It is just like using a ruler  to  rap\r\n\r\nthe  knuckles  of  a  child who  is  persistently\r\n\r\ncreating trouble. It should not be forgotten that\r\n\r\nthe Government only took action when Enright made\r\n\r\na  second statement. The first occasion  was  the\r\n\r\npublication  in  the  Malayan  Undergrad  of   an\r\n\r\ninterview  which  he  gave  when  he  arrived  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. The second occasion was when  he  made\r\n\r\nhis  inaugural address. Unfortunately he did  not\r\n\r\nstick  to his subject and it was when he  crossed\r\n\r\nthe  line that he got the rapping. Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nwas  necessary  for Enright  to  be  told  in  no\r\n\r\nuncertain  terms  that there would  be  no  third\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the third point, whether aliens have\r\n\r\nthe  right to comment on and criticise Government\r\n\r\npolicy, the Member for Farrer Park has, in  fact,\r\n\r\nagreed that it would be advisable that all aliens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  told that they should not comment on nor take\r\n\r\npart  in  politics, nor to speak on controversial\r\n\r\nissues  which  are matters of importance  to  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of the State. This is important, as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park has indicated that in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Malaya, which was established  in\r\n\r\n1949,  there  is  a Senate which  is  largely  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate  class. Mind you, this is a  relic  of\r\n\r\nthe  days  when the University of  Malaya  was  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  University. In the  past,  whenever  we\r\n\r\ntalked  about  expatriates,  we  meant  to  imply\r\n\r\nexpatriates   of   European   origin.   In    the\r\n\r\nUniversity, however, an expatriate is one who  is\r\n\r\na  non-Malayan, so we have expatriates  of  every\r\n\r\nhue and colour, from white to yellow to dark.  In\r\n\r\n1949,  the  Senate of the University  of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nwhich  is composed largely of professors  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  departments of the University,  numbered\r\n\r\naround  25  of which there were only  four  local\r\n\r\nmembers. Today, there is a possible membership of\r\n\r\n38,  but I think the average attendance is around\r\n\r\n35,   and   only  a  third  are  local   members.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we have a Senate in which  two-thirds\r\n\r\nare  expatriates.  It  is  important  that  in  a\r\n\r\nsituation like this, when Singapore is doing  its\r\n\r\nbest  to  create  a common culture  and  identity\r\n\r\namong  its  people, with all the difficulties  of\r\n\r\nlanguage  and so forth, that the Senate which  is\r\n\r\nlargely controlled by expatriates should be fully\r\n\r\nconversant with the trends and tendencies of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  If we do not call a halt to  expatriate\r\n\r\nmembers of the University staff commenting on the\r\n\r\npolicies of this country, then we shall  have  an\r\n\r\nimpossible  position in which expatriate  members\r\n\r\nof the Senate will attempt to seek shelter in the\r\n\r\nUniversity  on  the  pretext  that   it   is   an\r\n\r\nautonomous institution, as if it were,  shall  we\r\n\r\nsay,  a foreign concession where they have\r\n\r\nextra-territorial rights, and from where they can snipe\r\n\r\nat  the  Government, and in which they  can  seek\r\n\r\nprotection. So I think (fortunately the case  has\r\n\r\nbeen satisfactorily settled) it was a timely move\r\n\r\non the part of Government to silence once and for\r\n\r\nall  expatriate  members of  the  Senate  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya. As explained by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in his speech to the students\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat   their  annual  dinner,  before  the  present\r\n\r\nConstitution  came  into  force,  every   British\r\n\r\nnational was a citizen of Singapore by virtue  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact that he was a British national, but  it\r\n\r\nis  now  necessary for one to prove one's loyalty\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  by  becoming a  Singapore  citizen\r\n\r\nbefore  he  has  the right to  criticise  and  to\r\n\r\ncomment on political issues in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do feel it is necessary at this stage to\r\n\r\nsay clearly to all those who are here on teaching\r\n\r\nassignments  that  they  have  freedom,  in   the\r\n\r\npursuit  of knowledge, to express their views  on\r\n\r\nthe  subject for which they are employed, but not\r\n\r\nto  cross the line, but that if they do so,  then\r\n\r\nthey will get what they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel, Sir, that the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park is only trying to stir up again  the\r\n\r\ndust when it has already settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a\r\n\r\nfeeling  that the Member for Farrer Park  has  to\r\n\r\nspeak on this motion, which has probably gone out\r\n\r\nof  date  since  it was first submitted  to  you,\r\n\r\nalthough  the  matter  has  been  more  or   less\r\n\r\namicably  settled,  and I  quite  understand  the\r\n\r\npredicament  of  the Member for  Farrer  Park  in\r\n\r\nhaving  to  flog a dead horse. But since  he  has\r\n\r\nindulged  in  flogging a dead  horse,  I  feel  I\r\n\r\nshould  comment  on  some of the  points  he  has\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first objection, as far as I can see, is to\r\n\r\nthe strong language used by the Government in its\r\n\r\ncommunication  to  Professor Enright.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nquite  sure, Sir, whether those words would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  permitted in this Assembly, but  if  anyone\r\n\r\nwere  to read the wartime speeches of Sir Winston\r\n\r\nChurchill, he would find that that hon, gentleman\r\n\r\nused   robust  language  when  he  felt  it   was\r\n\r\nnecessary to do so. In this particular  case,  in\r\n\r\nview   of  the  Professor's  remarks  which  were\r\n\r\ndirected  at certain policies that the Government\r\n\r\nis pursuing, which is to try and create a Malayan\r\n\r\nculture,  we  felt  that,  because  the   subject\r\n\r\nconcerned was so vital to us and because we  felt\r\n\r\nso strongly about it, it was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  make known our  feelings  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter in no uncertain terms; and I am quite sure\r\n\r\nthe  letter conveyed our feelings in no uncertain\r\n\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that issue was raised, there has been a\r\n\r\nlot  of talk about the sanctity of the University\r\n\r\nand   the  freedom  of  the  University.  But   I\r\n\r\nremember,  Sir,  there was an occasion  when  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of the University was involved,  when  a\r\n\r\nnumber of students said certain things which were\r\n\r\nnot  agreeable  to  the then  colonial  power.  A\r\n\r\nnumber of students were brought to trial,  but  I\r\n\r\ncannot  recollect  at  that time  the  Professors\r\n\r\ncoming  to  their defence, because  the  students\r\n\r\nespoused  a cause which has since then triumphed.\r\n\r\nBut  now  an  expatriate Professor made  what  we\r\n\r\nthought,  on  the  basis of  his  lectures,  were\r\n\r\nsneers  at the Government's policy - not  only  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  but a  policy  accepted  by\r\n\r\neverybody, including the Opposition - of trying  to\r\n\r\ncreate a Malayan culture at all costs. There were\r\n\r\ntwo   such  occasions.  On  the  first  occasion,\r\n\r\nProfessor  Enright  gave  an  interview   to   an\r\n\r\nundergraduate  journal, and he  must  have  known\r\n\r\nthat  a  report of it would be published  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  It  was in fact a  challenge  to  an\r\n\r\naccepted Government policy which is vital to  our\r\n\r\npolitical  peace  and  stability,  that  is,  the\r\n\r\ncreation of a Malayan culture. The Professor then\r\n\r\nsaid  that he did not think the Government should\r\n\r\nwaste its time in trying to go out of its way  to\r\n\r\ncreate   a   Malayan  culture   and   a   Malayan\r\n\r\nconsciousness and Malayan unity among the people.\r\n\r\nIt  was  couched in terms of a challenge.  A  few\r\n\r\ndays  later,  the Professor gave a lecture  on  a\r\n\r\nvery  admirable subject - \"Robert Graves  and  the\r\n\r\nDecline of Modernism\". In fact, Sir, if I may say\r\n\r\nso,  I  was  personally invited  to  attend  this\r\n\r\nlecture. At first, I intended to attend  it,  but\r\n\r\nperhaps some second instinct made me decide  that\r\n\r\nI  should not do so. It was just as well, because\r\n\r\nnot   only  would  the  Professor  have  had  the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  of  attacking  or  criticising  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  publicly, but perhaps he  would  also\r\n\r\nhave had the satisfaction of seeing a Minister of\r\n\r\nthe Government sitting quietly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlistening. Because at an inaugural lecture, I  am\r\n\r\ntold, you cannot talk back to the lecturer - to the\r\n\r\nlittle snipes and sneers that he might have made.\r\n\r\nWhen a Professor who has been here for only seven\r\n\r\nmonths  should suddenly say that not only is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wasting  its  time  but  that  it  is\r\n\r\nprobably wrong in trying to go out of its way  to\r\n\r\nweld  the  people  into  a  nation,  then  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the Government to make  it  quite\r\n\r\nclear  that  anyone who is not here to  take  the\r\n\r\nconsequences  of  his  gratuitous  advice  on  an\r\n\r\nimportant  matter should not give this gratuitous\r\n\r\nadvice. Surely, Sir, if Professor Enright makes a\r\n\r\nsuggestion,  his suggestion is more an  advocacy;\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is  a  Professor, he  can  naturally\r\n\r\ninfluence all the young students who sit  at  his\r\n\r\nfeet if he tells them that this is all a waste of\r\n\r\ntime, that the banning of jukeboxes really shocks\r\n\r\nhim,  and that the Government's attitude  towards\r\n\r\nyellow culture is equally shocking to him.  If  a\r\n\r\nProfessor  of his standing should claim  academic\r\n\r\nfreedom  to  make  what we  felt  to  be  asinine\r\n\r\nremarks such as yellow culture is something which\r\n\r\nis found everywhere and we should not do anything\r\n\r\nabout it, and implying we should re-open the\r\n\r\njuke-box  establishments which were recruiting grounds\r\n\r\nfor fresh gangsters; if that was all the advice a\r\n\r\nProfessor of his eminence - which he is, in his own\r\n\r\nright - could give, that the Government should stay\r\n\r\nout of this business of trying to weld the people\r\n\r\ninto one nation through the process of creating a\r\n\r\nMalayan  culture,  that  it  should  not  try  to\r\n\r\ninterfere  with jukebox operators,  and  that  it\r\n\r\nshould let yellow culture flourish, then we  felt\r\n\r\nthat  obviously the Professor was speaking  on  a\r\n\r\nmatter about which he was not fully informed.  He\r\n\r\nwas therefore called up - in fact, I was one of the\r\n\r\nMinisters  present  there - and  told  that,  as  a\r\n\r\nProfessor in English, he had a perfect  right  to\r\n\r\ndiscourse  on matters on which he was an  expert,\r\n\r\nbut   that  if  he  persisted  in  sneering   and\r\n\r\nbelittling  the Government's policy  on  culture,\r\n\r\nthen  he was really trying to undo a work,  which\r\n\r\nwe know is an extremely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficult and a very delicate one. It appeared to\r\n\r\nus  that  he was trying to upset the Government's\r\n\r\npolicy of creating a Malayan culture, and that it\r\n\r\nwould  therefore  be necessary  for  us  to  lake\r\n\r\naction  if he persisted in this. If the Professor\r\n\r\nhad  then  and  there accepted  the  position  as\r\n\r\nstated  by  the Government, that as an  alien  he\r\n\r\nshould   not   enter  into  political  issues - not\r\n\r\npolitics  as such - but political issues  of  great\r\n\r\nmoment to the country, then I am quite sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  matter would not have become the controversy\r\n\r\nthat it did become.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, when we say that aliens\r\n\r\nshould  not enter into political issues, it  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that a Professor of Political  Science\r\n\r\nshould  not  discuss politics.  But  when  it  is\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in  such  a way as  to  embarrass  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  the  people  who  are  trying  to\r\n\r\nachieve something, and where the speaker is not a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen who will take the consequences\r\n\r\nof  his advice, then we say that he has no  right\r\n\r\nto   enter   into  political  issues   of   great\r\n\r\nimportance to this country. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we\r\n\r\ntherefore  feel  that  the  Government  has  said\r\n\r\nnothing  which  needs  retracting,  and  it   has\r\n\r\ncertainly  done  nothing for which  it  feels  it\r\n\r\nshould  apologise to the Professor concerned.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the Member for Farrer Park was quite wrong\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said  that Professor Enright  needed  a\r\n\r\nreply. No reply is needed from the Government. We\r\n\r\npublished  Professor Enright's assurance  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  on  the  same  day  we   issued\r\n\r\nGovernment's letter stating that it was gratified\r\n\r\nto  note  that the Professor concerned had  given\r\n\r\nthis  assurance. If he had given it much earlier,\r\n\r\nhe   would  have  spared  himself,  a  number  of\r\n\r\nUniversity  students, and the Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  the  trouble of moving a motion asking  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to apologise for something  which  it\r\n\r\nfeels it has no occasion to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps I ought to explain to hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  that there is no motion as  such  before\r\n\r\nthe House. The motion is for the adjournment, and\r\n\r\nthere is only a discussion on the adjournment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  had not thought of speaking on this particular\r\n\r\nmotion  for the adjournment. But in view  of  the\r\n\r\nreplies  of  the Minister for Education  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture, I would  like  to  submit\r\n\r\nhere,  Sir, that their replies are no replies  at\r\n\r\nall  to  the  issues which the Member for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  has brought up. The Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\ndid  say  that there were three issues  involved.\r\n\r\nThe   first  issue  was  the  autonomy   of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity. That issue has been happily  resolved\r\n\r\nas  a  result of the exchange of letters  between\r\n\r\nProfessor Enright and the Minister for Labour and\r\n\r\nLaw,  and  the speech given by the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nat the dinner of the Students' Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue was about the first letter sent\r\n\r\nby  the Acting Minister for Labour and Law  which\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Farrer Park said was couched  in\r\n\r\nlanguage  most  unbecoming of a Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nState of Singapore. Use as strong language as the\r\n\r\nMinister  wants,  use as robust  language  as  he\r\n\r\npleases,  but  for the dignity of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  never  should  he  stoop   to   using\r\n\r\nunbecoming language. For the wrongs of  Professor\r\n\r\nEnright,  in  the  eyes of  the  Government,  why\r\n\r\nshould all Professors in the University of Malaya\r\n\r\nbe  classified  as  \"mendicant professors\"?  What\r\n\r\nelse  do  the  words \"mendicant professors\" - those\r\n\r\nwere  the words used - mean if they were not  meant\r\n\r\nto  apply to expatriate Professors who come  here\r\n\r\nto  teach  our children to become better citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  when they are being  lumped  into\r\n\r\nthat  term \"mendicant professors\"? They may  earn\r\n\r\ntheir living elsewhere. They may be able to  earn\r\n\r\nmuch  more outside Singapore. They come here  and\r\n\r\ntry  to do their part. For a Minister to use such\r\n\r\nunbecoming language, it is felt by the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park, and I share that feeling with  him,\r\n\r\nis not becoming of a Minister of a young State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue brought up by the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer   Park  was  that  if  restriction   about\r\n\r\ncriticism of Government policies is to be  placed\r\n\r\non aliens,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  the  Government should see to it  that  the\r\n\r\nrestriction  is  placed on  all  aliens.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture were to ask his staff to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  the  newspaper  reports,  he  would   be\r\n\r\ninformed  that there had been criticisms  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  on culture  by  some  other\r\n\r\nvisitors.  What surprised the Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark was that it should be aimed at one, and that\r\n\r\nthe  others should be left free to say what  they\r\n\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I really do not wish to\r\n\r\ncomment   on   what  has  occurred  between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and Professor Enright.  But  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  very  much to reply to what the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  has  said about the  Government  using\r\n\r\nunbecoming  language. Apparently he objects  very\r\n\r\nmuch to the terms \"mendicant\" and \"asinine\".  May\r\n\r\nI  say,  Mr Speaker, that the value of terms  is\r\n\r\nrelative?  For example, if you call Tun  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock  Professor Tun Lim Yew Hock in this country,\r\n\r\nit  is an honour. He is treated with respect. But\r\n\r\nI  am  told that in the United States,  when  you\r\n\r\ncall a man \"professor\", you mean he is a quack. I\r\n\r\nmyself   had  the  unhappy  experience,   in   my\r\n\r\nignorance, of calling a real professor  who  came\r\n\r\nfrom  the  United States \"Professor\", and  I  was\r\n\r\nvery much rebuffed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out, Mr Speaker, that a\r\n\r\nProfessor  of English in particular, and  a  poet\r\n\r\ntoo, would surely consider\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  this  as either poetic licence or  political\r\n\r\nlicence,  and I do not seriously believe  that  a\r\n\r\nman  of literary merit would very much object  to\r\n\r\nthe  term  \"mendicant\", just as much as  we  have\r\n\r\ngathered quite lately that there is a four-letter\r\n\r\nword the use of which a jury in England have even\r\n\r\nadmitted to be quite proper. On the other hand  I\r\n\r\nwould  say that in other countries such  a  \r\n\r\nfour-letter  word would be very improper.  This  again\r\n\r\nbears out my point that the value of a phrase  or\r\n\r\na  word  is  relative to values  which  exist  in\r\n\r\ndifferent countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end on this note. We certainly\r\n\r\ndo   not   wish   to  see  aliens,  non-Malayans,\r\n\r\ninterfere  in  our  political life.  And  as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park has said, while we are  in\r\n\r\nthe process of seeking a national identity, while\r\n\r\nwe  are trying to form a cohesive whole from  out\r\n\r\nof a crucible that is molten, we should not allow\r\n\r\noutside forces to tamper with our efforts. And  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  end with this note  of  warning.\r\n\r\nAliens  also should not permit themselves  to  be\r\n\r\nused as political tools or the political pawns of\r\n\r\nothers who have an interest in local politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Six minutes to Seven o'clock to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Thursday, 8th December,1960.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
