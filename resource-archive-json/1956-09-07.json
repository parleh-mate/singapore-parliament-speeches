Hart):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I have His Excellency's authority to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of\r\n\r\n$4,308,250  shall  be supplied to  the  Government\r\n\r\nunder  the  heads  of  expenditure  and  for   the\r\n\r\nservices  specified in the Schedule  contained  in\r\n\r\nSessional Paper No. Cmd. 43 of 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule contains the applications for\r\n\r\nsupplementary  vote which have  accumulated  since\r\n\r\nthe last sitting of the Assembly. The applications\r\n\r\namount to a total of about $4.3 millions, making a\r\n\r\ntotal  of supplementary votes for this year  of  a\r\n\r\nlittle over $11 millions compared to the total  of\r\n\r\n$27  millions on approximately the same date  last\r\n\r\nyear.  I  mention these figures because  strenuous\r\n\r\nefforts  have,  in  fact,  been  made  to   reduce\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditure in general and to limit the\r\n\r\nnumber  of applications for supplementary vote  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  and  because  criticisms  have   been\r\n\r\nlevelled  at  the  rate of Government  expenditure\r\n\r\nboth in and outside the Assembly. The fact of  the\r\n\r\nmatter is that applications for supplementary vote\r\n\r\nare  inevitable and inescapable. It is  impossible\r\n\r\nto  foresee  future needs when the  estimates  are\r\n\r\nframed. Needs arise which it would be shortsighted\r\n\r\nnot   to  meet  as  soon  as  possible.  The  same\r\n\r\nsituation arises in every type of organisation. It\r\n\r\nis not peculiar to Government alone. All we can do\r\n\r\nis    to    endeavour   to   limit   supplementary\r\n\r\napplications to essential services. I do think  we\r\n\r\nare making some progress in that direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first task is to report that, contrary to my\r\n\r\nundertaking at an earlier sitting of the Assembly,\r\n\r\nI  have authorised two applications for funds  for\r\n\r\nposts  in  anticipation of  the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. The first item is No.202. In this  case,\r\n\r\nwhich  is fully explained in the Schedule, it  was\r\n\r\nrepresented to me by the Chief Justice through  my\r\n\r\nhon.   Friend  the  Attorney-General   (Mr C.   H.\r\n\r\nButterfield)   that   the   appointment   of   two\r\n\r\nadditional  Reporters  was  a  matter   of   great\r\n\r\nurgency.   In   consequence,   I   approved    the\r\n\r\nappointments with effect from the 1st of June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item is No. 238. In this case, it was\r\n\r\nrepresented  to  me  by the Registrar  of  Malayan\r\n\r\nStatistics  that the work of preparation  for  the\r\n\r\nfield census tests proposed for the autumn of this\r\n\r\nyear  would be seriously held up if a stenographer\r\n\r\nwere not appointed immediately to keep the minutes\r\n\r\nand  act  as  Assistant Secretary  to  the  Census\r\n\r\nAdvisory   Committee.   After   a   very   careful\r\n\r\nexamination   of   the  case  submitted   by   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar,  I agreed to his request and authorised\r\n\r\nthe  creation  of the post with effect  from  10th\r\n\r\nJuly, 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also report that I have authorised a start\r\n\r\nto  be  made with the construction of hutted  camp\r\n\r\naccommodation for the Singapore Battalion.  It  is\r\n\r\ndesirable  to  raise  the  Battalion  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.  The rate of recruitment  depends  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain    extent    on   the   availability    of\r\n\r\naccommodation  and it was therefore  important  to\r\n\r\nauthorise  the immediate commencement of  work  so\r\n\r\nthat recruitment should not be held up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that it was in the interest of\r\n\r\nefficient  administration that  these  authorities\r\n\r\nshould  be given. May I ask hon. Members  to  give\r\n\r\ncovering approval?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various applications are explained in some\r\n\r\ndetail  in  the  Schedule  but  perhaps  attention\r\n\r\nshould be drawn to one or two items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain amount of publicity has been given to\r\n\r\nitem  206, Cost of Telegrams, which, incidentally,\r\n\r\nhas no direct connection with the Merdeka Mission.\r\n\r\nAs means of communication develop, so one tends to\r\n\r\nuse  them. The habit has grown steadily  over  the\r\n\r\nyears to communicate by telegram and radiogram. It\r\n\r\nsaves  much  time and, I think, leads  to  greater\r\n\r\nefficiency   and   the   speedier   despatch   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  business. The practice is  common  not\r\n\r\nonly  in Government but also in business and other\r\n\r\ncircles.  Following this growing habit, Government\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on telegrams has tended to  increase.\r\n\r\nExpenditure over the past five years has  been  as\r\n\r\nfollows:1952,   $12,000;  1953,   $19,000;   1954,\r\n\r\n$23,000;  1955, $38,000; from 1st January  to  9th\r\n\r\nAugust,  1956, $32,000. The considerable  increase\r\n\r\nin 1956 over 1955\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfigures  has  been due, in the main, to  increased\r\n\r\ncommunication  on constitutional  matters  in  the\r\n\r\nearly part of this year. The original vote has now\r\n\r\nbeen expended and a supplement of $30,000 is asked\r\n\r\nfor.  This estimate was made in early June on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of average monthly expenditure in the first\r\n\r\npart  of the year. There has been a slight falling\r\n\r\noff   in  expenditure  since  that  date  but  the\r\n\r\napplication  has been kept to the  same  level  in\r\n\r\norder  to cover all possible contingencies in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   There   has  been  no  extravagance   in\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  Telegrams  are  despatched  to   all\r\n\r\nquarters  of  the globe and cover the multifarious\r\n\r\nbusiness of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 209 to 216 inclusive provide staff for the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of the Office of the  Director  of\r\n\r\nPersonnel.   This   office  has   been   seriously\r\n\r\nunderstaffed  with the result that staff  matters,\r\n\r\nstaff negotiations and other similar matters  have\r\n\r\nbeen  considerably delayed. It is hoped  that  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of  the Branch now  proposed  will\r\n\r\nenable these matters to be speeded up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 218 seeks funds for ten Supernumerary posts\r\n\r\nto  enable officers of the subordinate services to\r\n\r\nbe  tried  out for promotion to the Administrative\r\n\r\nService.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 233 provides, inter alia, for a small car\r\n\r\nfor  a  most  courageous  police  officer  who  is\r\n\r\ncompletely  paralysed from the  waist  down  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  a  wound incurred in a  fight  with  a\r\n\r\ngunman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 220 to 232 inclusive seek provision for the\r\n\r\ninitial  steps  required for the  raising  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Battalion which is regarded as a  matter\r\n\r\nof top priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I shall be happy to amplify any\r\n\r\nof the explanations given in the Schedule.

It appears from the explanation that  the\r\n\r\nFriends  of Singapore have sponsored this painting\r\n\r\nof  Sir John Nicoll for a sum of $5,500. They have\r\n\r\nbeen  able to collect only $2,100 and they  expect\r\n\r\nor they are hoping that the City Council will bear\r\n\r\nhalf  the balance and this Assembly will bear half\r\n\r\nthe balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have no objections to people forming\r\n\r\nquaint  societies  like the Friends  of  Singapore\r\n\r\namongst whose objects is the entertainment of past\r\n\r\nand  present Governors and one of whose duties  is\r\n\r\nto  collect  portraits of previous Governors.  But\r\n\r\nhaving launched this undertaking, to come round to\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and expect it  to  pay  half  the\r\n\r\nbalance  which they cannot raise is,  to  say  the\r\n\r\nvery  least,  just  not good form.  If  they  want\r\n\r\nkudos,  as I am sure the President of the  Friends\r\n\r\nof Singapore, who was once A.D.C. to the Governor,\r\n\r\nwants  kudos for paying tribute to past Governors,\r\n\r\nthen  let  them  cough up and  not  come  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly and ask for a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

It\r\n\r\nis not a Society to entertain Governors or to give\r\n\r\nfarewell  parties and so on.

It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossible   that   they  might   have   entertained\r\n\r\nGovernors, though personally since the last  three\r\n\r\nyears   I   have  not  attended  any  meeting - none\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.

If the Friends of Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nSociety sponsored this portrait, it is up to  them\r\n\r\nto bear the expense for it and if they cannot find\r\n\r\nthe  money  themselves, then let them  go  to  the\r\n\r\npublic. A portrait of the Governor should be  paid\r\n\r\nfor  by  individual contributions from the  public\r\n\r\nand  not through this Assembly. Let them go to the\r\n\r\npublic    and    ask   for   contributions.    The\r\n\r\ncontributions may be ten cents, a dollar  or  five\r\n\r\ndollars individually. That should be the right way\r\n\r\nrather than that this Assembly should be asked  to\r\n\r\nvote  for meeting the balance of the cost of  this\r\n\r\nportrait.

At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  it  was considered that this was a somewhat\r\n\r\nunsympathetic attitude to adopt to an  association\r\n\r\nwhich has done a great deal to arouse and maintain\r\n\r\ninterest   in   the  historical  associations   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  which  many of  my  colleagues  and  I\r\n\r\nregard as a most important matter.

In\r\n\r\nsome  cases,  as  in this case,  they  are  merely\r\n\r\nemployed  on  payment of a fee. What  happened  in\r\n\r\nthis  particular  case was that the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth,  in  framing his estimates,  thought  that\r\n\r\nthere  would still be sufficient posts and savings\r\n\r\navailable  from which these temporary  specialists\r\n\r\nwho had come to the assistance of Government could\r\n\r\nbe   paid.   It  has  now  happened   that,   with\r\n\r\nrecruitment from the University of Malaya  medical\r\n\r\nschool,  these  posts  have  been  filled.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  necessary to create a vote to  pay  the\r\n\r\nspecialists.  That is why we ask for  these  token\r\n\r\nvotes.  Sir,  I  cannot explain  the  matter  more\r\n\r\nclearly.

But,  in\r\n\r\neffect, what it means is this: at the time of  the\r\n\r\nBudget, it was expected that only one person would\r\n\r\nbe  acting  in that capacity, or would  fill  that\r\n\r\nparticular post, but now two persons are doing the\r\n\r\njob - one,  the person who filled the Head would  be\r\n\r\nnewly recruited; and, two, this person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I agree with the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar that it would be desirable in the future  if\r\n\r\nwe  have  special provision in the  Estimates  for\r\n\r\npayments to specialists.

For a variety of reasons, work on  some\r\n\r\nitems would be held up and funds, and Public Works\r\n\r\ncapacity, would be available for reallocation.  If\r\n\r\nthis proved to be the case, a switch programme  of\r\n\r\nwork should be introduced. Events have turned  out\r\n\r\nas  expected. It is now clear that there  will  be\r\n\r\nunder-expenditure  on  some  items  and  that  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works Department will be able  to  utilise\r\n\r\nthe  funds  made  available on other  projects  of\r\n\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule A lists the projects on which under-expenditure will occur. The total estimated under-expenditure is over $5 millions. The reasons for\r\n\r\nthe   under-expenditure  are  explained   in   the\r\n\r\nSchedule.  I  use  the  phrase \"under-expenditure\"\r\n\r\nadvisedly.  The  word \"savings\"  in  this  context\r\n\r\napparently leads to misunderstanding. In the great\r\n\r\nmajority of cases, the under-expenditure is merely\r\n\r\ndeferred  expenditure. There  are,  of  course,  a\r\n\r\nnumber of cases in which the under-expenditure  is\r\n\r\ntrue  saving. It will also be noted, not  only  in\r\n\r\nSchedule  A  but  also  in Schedule  B,  that  the\r\n\r\noriginal  estimate of cost has been revised  in  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  cases. It is not easy for  the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department to make an accurate estimate  of\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of a new project in advance of detailed\r\n\r\nplanning  and  investigation. Many estimates  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  on the basis of a rough  guide  as  to\r\n\r\nrequirements from a department without  plans  and\r\n\r\nwithout  knowledge of the site. It  is  only  when\r\n\r\nplans and working drawings are made and when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquantities  are  taken  and  sites  obtained   and\r\n\r\nexamined, that accurate estimates of cost  can  be\r\n\r\nmade.  Even  these sometimes have to  be  revised.\r\n\r\nChanges  of  mind and ideas are not  unknown.  The\r\n\r\nsurprising   thing  is  not  that   the   original\r\n\r\nestimates have to be revised but that they have to\r\n\r\nbe  revised so seldom and by so little. There are,\r\n\r\nhowever,  one  or  two  cases  where  the  revised\r\n\r\nestimate  has  differed  substantially  from   the\r\n\r\noriginal. One case is that of the Polytechnic. The\r\n\r\noriginal  estimate of cost shown in the  Estimates\r\n\r\nwas $5.19 millions. This was based on the estimate\r\n\r\nmade in the Gibson Report. It was taken as a rough\r\n\r\nguide  until  a more accurate estimate,  based  on\r\n\r\nplans, could be made. Of the $5.19 millions,  $1.4\r\n\r\nmillion was for equipment for the workshops,  etc.\r\n\r\nNo  allowance  was made for quarters and  playing-fields.  Plans  were, drawn up by  the  architects\r\n\r\ncommissioned for the job and it became clear  that\r\n\r\nthe  sum of $3.8 millions would only go a part  of\r\n\r\nthe  way  towards  meeting the cost  of  essential\r\n\r\nbuildings. Later, these plans had to be revised in\r\n\r\nthe  light  of  advice obtained from the  Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil  in  London  about the  latest  trends  in\r\n\r\ntechnical college buildings. Only recently has  it\r\n\r\nbeen  possible  to  arrive at a  reliable  revised\r\n\r\nestimate  of cost. This totals $11.4 millions  and\r\n\r\nincludes  $7.5  millions for  buildings  and  site\r\n\r\npreparation;  $2\u00bd  millions  for  equipment   and\r\n\r\nfittings;  $1  million  for  staff  quarters;  and\r\n\r\n$500,000 for playing fields. The whole project has\r\n\r\nbeen  reexamined  in the light  of  this  somewhat\r\n\r\nstartling increase in cost. Plans prepared by  the\r\n\r\narchitects  were examined with great care  by  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Public Works and  his  architectural\r\n\r\nstaff.  The increase in cost is due in part  to  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  rise in the cost of structural  steel\r\n\r\nand  other  building materials,  and  in  part  to\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the  plan.  In  the  opinion  of  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Public Works, the maximum  economies\r\n\r\nhave been practised in planning the buildings  and\r\n\r\nthere is little opportunity for further reduction.\r\n\r\nIt  has been decided, however, to refer the  plans\r\n\r\nonce  more  to the Advisory Committee on  Building\r\n\r\nCosts  to  find  out whether economies  cannot  be\r\n\r\nachieved on finishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the proposed scope of the Polytechnic has\r\n\r\nbeen  examined  with a view to seeing  whether  it\r\n\r\ncould  not  be reduced, at least at the start.  As\r\n\r\nhon.  Members are aware, it is intended  that  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic should teach engineering, commerce and\r\n\r\ngeneral    education,   science,   building    and\r\n\r\narchitecture,  pure  and applied  art,  management\r\n\r\nand,  for women, dressmaking and cookery. However,\r\n\r\nthe   general  conclusion  reached  is   that   if\r\n\r\nSingapore is to have the type of institution which\r\n\r\nit undoubtedly needs, the proposed scope will have\r\n\r\nto  be maintained and buildings of the type and on\r\n\r\nthe  scale suggested will have to be erected.  All\r\n\r\nthat  can be achieved in the way of saving  is  to\r\n\r\ncut   out  the  proposed  canteen,  gymnasium  and\r\n\r\nauditorium  blocks  for  the  time  being.   These\r\n\r\nbuildings,   which  are  estimated  to   cost   $2\r\n\r\nmillions,  are not essential for the operation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Polytechnic.  They can be  deferred  until  a\r\n\r\nlater   date  when  their  construction   can   be\r\n\r\nconsidered  in  the  light of the  then  financial\r\n\r\nposition.  In addition, efforts will  be  made  to\r\n\r\nreduce  expenditure on quarters by the  allocation\r\n\r\nof Government quarters which may become surplus in\r\n\r\nthe  future. No decision has yet been  reached  on\r\n\r\nthe  question of provision of playing  fields.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way, the existing commitment can be  reduced\r\n\r\nto   $8  millions,  that  is,  $5.5  millions  for\r\n\r\nessential   buildings  and   $2.5   millions   for\r\n\r\nequipment, part of which may, we hope, be obtained\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Colombo  Plan and other  sources,  thus\r\n\r\nachieving a further saving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Hospital is another case in which the\r\n\r\noriginal   estimate  of  cost  has  been   revised\r\n\r\nupwards.  In this case, the original estimate  was\r\n\r\nmerely  a  rough guess at the possible cost  of  a\r\n\r\ndistrict   hospital.  Since  then,  more  detailed\r\n\r\nrequirements  as to quarters, kitchens,  theatres,\r\n\r\nhostels, etc., have been made available and it has\r\n\r\nbeen  possible to make a further estimate.  Again,\r\n\r\nsite  investigation has indicated  that  extensive\r\n\r\nand  expensive  piling will be  required  if  this\r\n\r\nKallang  site is to be used. Even so, this  latest\r\n\r\nestimate  is still a rough one in the  absence  of\r\n\r\nfinal  details  about the site and  of  plans  and\r\n\r\nworking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrawings.  The cost of the Hospital is certain  to\r\n\r\nbe   more   than   $3.2  millions  as   originally\r\n\r\nestimated,  but  the  latest  estimate   of   $6.5\r\n\r\nmillions  should  be  regarded  with  considerable\r\n\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are a number of items in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  original estimate  of  cost  has  been\r\n\r\nreduced;  for  example, the  Mount  Vernon  Police\r\n\r\nproject,  the  Teachers Training College  and  the\r\n\r\nKallang Bridge - to mention only three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule B contains a list of the items in which\r\n\r\nit  is  desired to use part of the surplus  funds.\r\n\r\nThese  items will utilise $3.4 millions.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthe  projects are of interest. A start  is  to  be\r\n\r\nmade   with  a  new  programme  of  six  secondary\r\n\r\nschools: that at Bukit Panjang will commence  this\r\n\r\nyear.  A start will be made in preparing the  site\r\n\r\nfor  the  Raffles National Library. A  start  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  made  for a new institution  for  mental\r\n\r\ndefectives at Woodbridge. A postal sorting  office\r\n\r\nat  Paya Lebar Airport should speed up the sorting\r\n\r\nand  delivery  of mails by 24 hours. Provision  is\r\n\r\nmade  for  the  first phase of the  Geylang  flood\r\n\r\nprevention scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall end by saying that provision will be made\r\n\r\nin   the   1957   Development  Estimates   for   a\r\n\r\ncontinuation, where necessary, of the items listed\r\n\r\nin  Schedule B and for a continuation of the items\r\n\r\nlisted in Schedule A.

It  is\r\n\r\nanticipated  that, in the near future,  owners  of\r\n\r\npassenger vessels registered in the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nmay call upon us to survey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparts  of the internal hull of a ship and we  also\r\n\r\nexpect  them to call upon us to survey  parts  of\r\n\r\nthe external hull of ships. This is the first time\r\n\r\nthat  such  partial surveys will be recognised  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Transport and Civil  Aviation  in\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom as going towards a full survey\r\n\r\nfor a Passenger Safety Certificate to be issued by\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom Government. The opportunity has\r\n\r\nalso  been taken to see that these fees are  fixed\r\n\r\nas  a  fair proportion of the full prescribed fees\r\n\r\nfor  the complete survey of hulls.
