It has become increasingly  evident\r\n\r\nduring  the  last  8  days  that  in  relation  to  the\r\n\r\namendment proposed by the Member for Queenstown to  the\r\n\r\nmerger  motion  moved by the Minister for  Labour,  all\r\n\r\npoints of view appear already to have been advanced and\r\n\r\nto have been thoroughly discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, it has been distinctly noticed that\r\n\r\ncertain  Members on both sides of the House  have  been\r\n\r\nunable  to offer any new arguments and have,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nrepeated the arguments used by other Members.  While  a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of repetition is inevitable in a debate,\r\n\r\nconstant  repetition of the same  theme  and  the  same\r\n\r\narguments becomes tedious and is not permitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had occasion to refer to the relevant Standing\r\n\r\nOrder  on  this  point, and, as a further  reminder  to\r\n\r\nHonourable  Members, I propose, to read that  Standing\r\n\r\nOrder  again. It is Standing Order No. 54 and reads  as\r\n\r\nfollows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'54. The Speaker or the Chairman, after having drawn\r\n\r\nattention  to the conduct of a Member, who persists  in\r\n\r\nirrelevance, or tedious repetition either  of  his  own\r\n\r\narguments or of the arguments used by other Members  in\r\n\r\ndebate, may direct him to discontinue his speech.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent to which the debate on this matter has been\r\n\r\ndrawn out is largely due to repetitions of Members' own\r\n\r\narguments  or the arguments used by other  Members  and\r\n\r\nif,  in future, the repetitions become tedious, I shall\r\n\r\nfind  myself  compelled, as I am  bound  to  under  the\r\n\r\nStanding  Order,  to  direct  the  Member  speaking  to\r\n\r\ndiscontinue  his speech. This I am always reluctant  to\r\n\r\ndo, more especially in this particular debate, which is\r\n\r\none on a matter of such grave import to the peoples  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and indeed to the peoples of the whole of the\r\n\r\nfuture Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is incumbent upon me as Speaker\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the debate is kept within  its  proper\r\n\r\nbounds.  With  that  in view, I  called  a  meeting  of\r\n\r\nLeaders  of  all Parties represented on the  Opposition\r\n\r\nBenches,  the  independent  Member  on  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nBenches,  the  Leader of the House and  the  Government\r\n\r\nWhip  in order to ascertain whether there could be some\r\n\r\nagreement whereby the conclusion of the present  debate\r\n\r\ncould be reached at the earliest possible moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain devices are adopted in other Parliaments to\r\n\r\nbring  proceedings to a speedy conclusion, but  I  need\r\n\r\nmention only two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, time limits may be placed on the length of\r\n\r\nspeeches  and,  secondly, Members  voluntarily  subject\r\n\r\nthemselves to self-discipline in relation to  the  time\r\n\r\nthey should allow themselves and the substance of their\r\n\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting of Members of the Opposition and the Leader\r\n\r\nof the House was held in my Chamber this morning and it\r\n\r\nwas  agreed that the second device would best meet  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances   in   the  present  debate.   I   invite\r\n\r\nHonourable Members to adopt the course suggested,  that\r\n\r\nis to say, to subject themselves to self-discipline and\r\n\r\nso  to  see  that their speeches are not  unnecessarily\r\n\r\nlengthy and to avoid unnecessary repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GOVERNMENT CHINESE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SECONDARY IV EXAMINATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Education)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Yong, a ministerial statement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today is the\r\n\r\nsecond   last  day  of  the  Government  Secondary   IV\r\n\r\nExamination to be held in the Chinese medium.

On\r\n\r\nthe  28th  November  we presented our  opinion  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education to ask for protection for  those\r\n\r\nstudents  who  wish  to  take  the  Government   common\r\n\r\nexamination  and to allow them to do so  smoothly.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education explained to them that  because\r\n\r\nthe Government wishes to avoid any conflict between the\r\n\r\npolice  and the students, it has, therefore, not  asked\r\n\r\nthe police to take any direct measure. During these few\r\n\r\ndays  the  student strikers have resorted to  force  to\r\n\r\nstop  the  parents  and  students  from  entering   the\r\n\r\nexamination centres. For the safety of the students and\r\n\r\nthe parents, we hone that the Legislative Assembly will\r\n\r\nalso  adopt measures, just as the Assembly has  already\r\n\r\napproved  a  resolution  to protect  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Minister for Education.

This  will  conclude  my\r\n\r\nspeech.  What  the  Minister  for  Education  said  was\r\n\r\npublished  on 24th November, in the Sin Chew  Jit  Poh.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  for Education said that if  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  leaders  were  sincere  in  fighting  for   a\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger, then they should give up their  fight\r\n\r\nfor a full internal self-government -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Could it be made clear whether it\r\n\r\nis  the  Minister  for  Culture  or  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture.  He  said  the  aim  of  full  internal  self-government would negate the goal of complete merger. It\r\n\r\nwould also cause racial conflict between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret what the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture  said on this point. The stand of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis is very clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made our proposals based on the present\r\n\r\nsituation in Singapore:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Complete merger. The content of this merger is that\r\n\r\ndefence  and  external affairs will be  vested  in  the\r\n\r\nhands of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government. Singapore citizens on Merger\r\n\r\nDay  should  automatically become Federal citizens  and\r\n\r\nthere  should  be proportionate representation  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A form of confederation. The content is that\r\n\r\ndefence  and external affairs should be vested  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  by arrangement, but Singapore  should  have\r\n\r\ncomplete control of its internal affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If these two proposals are not acceptable to the\r\n\r\nFederation,  then  we should put aside  our  fight  for\r\n\r\nmerger and be prepared to negotiate with Britain for  a\r\n\r\nself-governing Singapore by 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture confused these two things. I feel that he either deliberately want-ed to confuse these two points or that he was not very clear about them. According to the analysis of the Minister for Culture, he said that if we did this, then we would be causing racial conflict between the two territories. I feel that the Minister for Culture wanted to distort our struggle through constitutional means as something\r\n\r\nwhich  would  create  racial  troubles.  Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture  said  that  according  to   the\r\n\r\ncomplete merger proposals made by the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nunder  which  Singapore citizens would  become  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens,  Singapore citizens would lose  because  they\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  accept  the 4:1  ratio  in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice,  which  is now applicable in  the  Federation.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  said  that under the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nproposals,  they  would have to accept  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nprivileges would be given to Malays. I wonder if, after\r\n\r\nmerger,  the  Chinese in Singapore will  lose  and  the\r\n\r\nMalays  will benefit from these proposals. If  this  is\r\n\r\nso,  why  are our proposals not accepted by the  Tunku?\r\n\r\nDoes  the Tunku want to fight for the interests of only\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese?  I  cannot understand it. The  Government\r\n\r\nsaid   that   the  motive  behind  our   proposals   on\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is that we want to contest an election  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation to sit in the Federal Parliament. I want\r\n\r\nto issue a challenge.

Let  me  now\r\n\r\nanalyse   the  proposals.  What  is  their  object   in\r\n\r\nproposing  this amendment? The question of  merger  was\r\n\r\nraised  and discussed when they were in the  P.A.P.  At\r\n\r\nthat time, the Member for Queenstown did not object  to\r\n\r\nour  proposals  on  merger. Why  does  he  now  hold  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  opinion on this question? This  year,  there\r\n\r\nhave been some changes in our Party. The Members of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis launched a revolution to  ensure  for\r\n\r\nthemselves the posts of Prime Minister and Ministers. I\r\n\r\nwant  to tell the people of Singapore that they do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to fight for the benefit of the people. They want\r\n\r\nto fight for their own personal interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Anson by-election, the break-away from our\r\n\r\nParty  was  mainly  due  to the demand  of  some  trade\r\n\r\nunionists  that  they  should have  a  discussion  with\r\n\r\nBritain  for  full internal self-government.  That  was\r\n\r\nafter  our  defeat  in  Hong Lim.  That  is  why  these\r\n\r\npoliticians  are  now sitting on the other  side.  They\r\n\r\nhave  defected from our Party. Therefore,  we  can  say\r\n\r\nthat  they are waverers. They do not have a firm stand.\r\n\r\nThey are politicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me ask this question. What are\r\n\r\nthe  fears  of the trade unions if merger is achieved?\r\n\r\nAs  far  as  I understand, the question of  merger  was\r\n\r\nraised  by the Prime Minister of the Federation,  Tunku\r\n\r\nAbdul  Rahman. The P.A.P. then agreed to his  proposals\r\n\r\nin  principle,  because  this  is  what  we  have  been\r\n\r\nfighting for since the inception of our Party. At  that\r\n\r\ntime, some colonial officers came to Singapore and this\r\n\r\ncaused fears in the trade union movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were afraid that if we merge with the Right-wing\r\n\r\nFederation, it would :then be disadvantageous to the\r\n\r\nLeft-wing forces in Singapore. They have their\r\n\r\nproblems and we understand this. In those days, they\r\n\r\nsuspected that there was something fishy in the\r\n\r\ndiscussions held with the colonial officers. That is\r\n\r\nwhy the trade unionists started their fight against us.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, it was because of this that these\r\n\r\nopportunistic politicians were frightened. At that\r\n\r\ntime, they thought that if they aligned with the trade\r\n\r\nunionists -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> On a point of order.

Now  I\r\n\r\nwant  to talk on the causes of what is happening.  What\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis wish for is not in accordance with\r\n\r\nreality.  They  thought that if they aligned  with  the\r\n\r\ntrade   unionists,   they  could  topple   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  they could hold  the  posts  of  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and Ministers.

We have never  sold  out  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people. I feel that the  question  is\r\n\r\none  of either conditional or unconditional merger. The\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Opposition say that we are selling  out\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of the people. Let me  state  that  all\r\n\r\nthese  merger proposals will have to be decided by  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The  people  will\r\n\r\nthen  decide whether they accept our merger  proposals.\r\n\r\nYet  the Barisan Sosialis accuse us of selling out  the\r\n\r\npeople.  This is a groundless accusation. Some  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite have also said that we should resign.\r\n\r\nBut,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I have read  a  Chinese  book\r\n\r\ncalled \"The Three Kingdoms\" and I still remember a part\r\n\r\nof  it.  Tsao Tsao had a son called Tsao Chih.  Another\r\n\r\nson  called Tsao Pei tried usurp the kingship when Tsao\r\n\r\nTsao  died,  and Tsao Chih wrote a poem to his  brother\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"We are born of the same family.  Why  do  you\r\n\r\npersecute  me?\" From this, we can see the  attitude  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Socialis. They try to force us to  resign.\r\n\r\nThey  claim that they have the overwhelming support  of\r\n\r\nthe  people and that we have lost the confidence of the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody really knows who represents\r\n\r\nthe  people.

If\r\n\r\nthey  were elected again, then they could say that they\r\n\r\nhave  the  support of the people. Before  the  breakup,\r\n\r\nthey  did  represent the P.A.P., and therefore  I  hope\r\n\r\nthese ex-colleagues do not ask too much of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speakers Sir, on this issue of merger, we believe\r\n\r\nthere should be conditional merger because we have been\r\n\r\nseparated from the Federation for quite some  time.  We\r\n\r\nare  developing  on different lines.  The  P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nanalysed  the  situation  both  in  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation, and that is why we propose this conditional\r\n\r\nmerger.  Our  ex-colleagues also  previously  supported\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the education policy, we have\r\n\r\nsuggested  autonomy in education in our  proposals  for\r\n\r\nmerger.  We  can see the situation of secondary  school\r\n\r\nstudents  in  Singapore today.  That  is  why  we  have\r\n\r\nsuggested this conditional merger because we are afraid\r\n\r\nof  such  things.  But from the personal  viewpoint,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  there  is  something in the Chinese  education\r\n\r\npolicy  which  I  cannot  accept.  Some  of  them   are\r\n\r\nunreasonable.  Complete  merger  as  proposed  by   the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  is, therefore, contradictory.  I  am\r\n\r\nChinese, educated. I am now learning English. And if  I\r\n\r\nwere  to  answer Chinese question papers in English,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it would be difficult for me. Similarly,  if  we\r\n\r\naccept the Federation education policy, many people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  resent  it.  Those  heroes   who   are\r\n\r\nprotecting  Chinese  education - what  are  they  now?  I\r\n\r\nbelieve their aim is just to embarrass us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we feel it is important to have\r\n\r\nautonomy in labour, because when the P.A.P. framed  its\r\n\r\nlabour  policy,  we had specially emphasised  it  since\r\n\r\nmost of the members and cadres of the Party come from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  field  of  labour.  We  have  therefore  suggested\r\n\r\nautonomy   in  labour  in  order  to  look  after   the\r\n\r\nprivileges  of the workers. If we do not  make  such  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion,  then our ex-colleagues, i.e., the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  members  will accuse us of  selling  out  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  They  are bound to say this.  They  claim  to\r\n\r\nrepresent the workers, and yet they want to accept  the\r\n\r\nlabour policy of the Federation.

But some people say that we are  unfair.  I\r\n\r\nwill  say  this:  it  is  very fair  because  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  can elect their own representatives,  but  no\r\n\r\nFederation citizens can vote and stand for election  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. We cannot go, and they cannot come. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  I say it is fair. If we say we cannot go but  they\r\n\r\ncan  come, then it is unfair.

As I said,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot go and they cannot come. This is fair. It is\r\n\r\ntrue  that  it  is  not too good for  the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  Singapore we have the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nand  in  the Federation of Malaya we have the Socialist\r\n\r\nFront.  If  the Barisan Sosialis in Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nSocialist Front in the Federation could both  win  some\r\n\r\nseats  and  formed a majority of representatives,  then\r\n\r\nthey  could form their own government. If this happens,\r\n\r\nwe  can  then  say  that the Federation  is  under  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  Singapore. So we cannot say  that  we  are\r\n\r\nselling  out  the people of Singapore. That  is  why  I\r\n\r\nthink that whatever they have said on merger is just to\r\n\r\ndistort  the issue and to further their own  individual\r\n\r\naims.  That is why we have to oppose them.

Government  should  have\r\n\r\ndisplayed  such  a lack of seriousness.  Perhaps,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthey   were  so  perturbed  by  what  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, the Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis,  said\r\n\r\nin  his  address that they became so inattentive.  But,\r\n\r\nSir, I would rather like to believe that they were  all\r\n\r\nsuffering from a very serious attack of cold and thus a\r\n\r\nlittle  hard of hearing. As it is, Sir, both  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Culture and the Hon, the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  have wasted our time by dealing with  points\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been  dealt with and disposed  of  by  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Queenstown.  For  instance, they   both\r\n\r\nchallenged  the  Barisan  Sosialis  Members  to   state\r\n\r\ncategorically\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether the Party was prepared to accept the labour and\r\n\r\neducation  policies of the Government of the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya and all that they implied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, the Member for Queens-town has\r\n\r\nexplained our stand on this. This stand, Sir,  did  not\r\n\r\nfind  favour with the Member for Geylang Serai, and  he\r\n\r\nsaid'  so. I know he is not suffering from any cold.  I\r\n\r\nshall,  Sir,  later  on  explain  in  some  detail  our\r\n\r\nattitude  to the policies of the Federation Government.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would like to say first this much. The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  unlike the P.A.P., faces facts  and  is  not\r\n\r\nafraid  to  state clearly what it feels. In our  policy\r\n\r\nstatement,  Sir, we called the Federation  Government's\r\n\r\neducation  policy misguided. Further, we expressed  our\r\n\r\ndesire  to  change it on merger. I have not, Sir,  come\r\n\r\nacross any P.A.P. statement which dares categorically  to\r\n\r\ncondemn the Federation Government's policy. Its leaders\r\n\r\nonly  whisper that they are opposed to the Rahman Talib\r\n\r\nReport. Sir, I dare the Government to state clearly and\r\n\r\nunequivocally that they are opposed to the Rahman Talib\r\n\r\nReport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is of greater significance is\r\n\r\nthat   these   men,   who   call   themselves   Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalists  and socialists, now aspire  only  to  see\r\n\r\nsome social improvement in Singapore. They say that the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government's policies are wrong.  At  least\r\n\r\nthey say so in private, Sir. All today now agree to the\r\n\r\npolicies  of  a  Right-wing  Government.  Let   us   be\r\n\r\ngenerous,  Sir,  and  assume  that  they  are  a  shade\r\n\r\ndifferent from the S.P.A. Members who sit on this  side\r\n\r\nof the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in short, we have a situation in\r\n\r\nwhich  there  are men who call themselves Malayans  and\r\n\r\nwho disagree with the Federation Government's policies,\r\n\r\nbut  who  will not seek a constitutional way to  change\r\n\r\nthese  policies.  These people, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to be Malayan nationalists. Sir,  their  very\r\n\r\nactions  betray them to be no more than - it is a  pity,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  the Minister for Culture is not  here - petty\r\n\r\nparish - pump  politicians,  whose  politics   and\r\n\r\nsocialism are confined to the use of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconvenient  words  and phraseology  in  which  our  Dr\r\n\r\nGoebbels, the Minister for Culture, specialise. I would\r\n\r\nvery   much   like  to  call  them,  Sir,  \"parish-pump\r\n\r\npatriots\".  But  in  the face of the  sell-out  of  the\r\n\r\npolitical rights of the people of Singapore, it grieves\r\n\r\nme  to  say,  Sir,  that one just has  to  face  facts,\r\n\r\nhowever bitter they are. The word \"patriot\" would sound\r\n\r\ncompletely hollow in the light of their actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has attempted to sour\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  the  Barisan  Sosialis  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of the Federation of Malaya by accusing  us\r\n\r\nof trying to topple the Federation Government. Sir, the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis is a Socialist Party, and we  believe\r\n\r\nin  the  establishment of a socialist society  for  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  Malaya.  We  are  not  afraid  to  say  this\r\n\r\npublicly. We must, therefore, if we are to be  true  to\r\n\r\nour aim, strive to bring about by constitutional means,\r\n\r\na  government  for  the  people of  Malaya  which  will\r\n\r\nestablish a socialist society for the whole country. We\r\n\r\nknow  that the present Government in the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  does  not believe in socialism.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, has said this much.\r\n\r\nWe all know that the present Federation Government is a\r\n\r\nRight-wing Govern, ment. Therefore, in order  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout socialism for our country and our people we must,\r\n\r\nof  course, try by peaceful and constitutional means to\r\n\r\nconvince  the  people of Malaya that our  policies  are\r\n\r\nbetter  than  those  of the present Government  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. If the people agree with  us  and\r\n\r\ndecide  that  we  should be their Government,  then  we\r\n\r\nwill, of course, under those circumstances, replace the\r\n\r\npresent Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Day-dream!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> This, Sir, is not day-dream.

Suffice it for me to say that\r\n\r\nif the P.A.P. sincerely believes in socialism, then the\r\n\r\nonly way to bring about socialism is for it to replace\r\n\r\nthe present Federation Government, which we all know is\r\n\r\nnot a socialist Government. Sir, it would be relevant\r\n\r\nhere for me to say that the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\npersonally told me many times of his own feelings\r\n\r\ntowards the Federation Government.

As socialists,\r\n\r\nwe  disagree with his views and we have the courage  of\r\n\r\nour  convictions to state publicly that so long as  the\r\n\r\nTunku  and  the  Alliance Government pursue  Right-wing\r\n\r\npolicies,  it  shall be our responsibility  to  seek  a\r\n\r\nchange  in  these  policies  by  normal,  peaceful  and\r\n\r\nconstitutional methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance also alleged that it was\r\n\r\nwrong  for  us to demand full, complete merger  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  Penang and Malacca and also  to  demand  the\r\n\r\nautomatic  conversion  of  all  Singapore  citizens  to\r\n\r\nFederal citizens on merger. The Minister for Finance, I\r\n\r\nnote, Sir, has conveniently kept away from the Chamber.\r\n\r\nI  would rather he listen to this. He said that we  now\r\n\r\nrealise  our mistake in referring to Penang and Malacca\r\n\r\nand  that we have started changing our propaganda line.\r\n\r\nSir,  this  accusation,  I  believe,  was  subsequently\r\n\r\nrepeated by the Minister for Culture and also, I think,\r\n\r\nby  the Deputy Prime Minister. Sir, when we referred to\r\n\r\nSingapore merging completely with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation,  like Penang and Malacca, we  were  merely\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the  fact  that  Singapore,  Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca  were originally the three Straits  Settlements\r\n\r\nunder direct colonial rule without any Malay sultanage.\r\n\r\nOur  point  was that if Penang and Malacca, which  were\r\n\r\nboth  colonial  territories like  Singapore,  could  be\r\n\r\nmerged  completely with the Federation  as  constituent\r\n\r\nStates,  then  Singapore could  also  be  merged  as  a\r\n\r\nconstituent  States.  There  is  nothing  contradictory\r\n\r\nbetween this and our demand for automatic conversion of\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  to Federal  citizens  on  complete\r\n\r\nmerger. Sir, when Penang and Malacca were joined to the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya and Singapore at the same time was\r\n\r\nseparated   from  the  mainland,  the   three   Straits\r\n\r\nSettlements  were all in the most elementary  stage  of\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule.  There was no degree of self-government\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  in  any of the Straits Settlements.  Penang\r\n\r\nand  Malacca, when they were joined to the  Federation,\r\n\r\ndid not have any State citizenship. So was the case  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in those days. But, Mr Speaker, Sir,  since\r\n\r\nits   separation  from  the  mainland,  Singapore   has\r\n\r\ndeveloped on its own to almost complete self-government\r\n\r\nand has thereby acquired a State citizenship of its own\r\n\r\ntogether with a Head of State. This, Sir, is just  hard\r\n\r\npolitical reality. It is an objective factor  which  we\r\n\r\nsimply cannot ignore. If Singapore is to merge with the\r\n\r\nFederation  now, then the Federation, if it is  sincere\r\n\r\nin wanting merger, has to recognise this hard political\r\n\r\nreality and take in Singapore as it is now, and not  as\r\n\r\nit was at the time of separation. Sir, the 11 States in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya and Singapore may be compared\r\n\r\nto a family of 12 people, and one member of this family\r\n\r\nwas  unfortunately separated by the  British  from  the\r\n\r\nrest  of the family when it was still a small boy. This\r\n\r\nboy,  Sir,  we  can  call Singapore.  At  the  time  of\r\n\r\nseparation. Singapore and all the other members of  the\r\n\r\nfamily were small boys. Sir, it is now 16 years  since\r\n\r\nthey  were  separated. During this period,  this  small\r\n\r\nboy,  Singapore, has developed in stature and  maturity\r\n\r\nand  is  now  a fully grown-up man, though still  under\r\n\r\nBritish bondage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe  has  also got married and has children of his  own.\r\n\r\nNow, he likes to join back with the rest of his family.\r\n\r\nSurely,  Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be very unfair  for\r\n\r\nthe   other  11  brothers  to  demand  that  this  boy,\r\n\r\nSingapore,  should  divorce  his  wife  and  leave  his\r\n\r\nchildren  before he could join the rest of his  family,\r\n\r\nespecially,  Sir,  when we find  that  these  11  other\r\n\r\nbrothers  have also, in the meanwhlie, got married  and\r\n\r\nhave  children of their own. It is unfair, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, that this boy, Singapore, who is now a full grown-up  man,  should join with the rest of his family  with\r\n\r\nhis  wife  and children, and not as though  he  were  a\r\n\r\nbachelor when he is not, in fact, a bachelor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has tried to give the\r\n\r\nimpression that it is unreasonable to demand  automatic\r\n\r\nconversion of Singapore citizens to Federal citizenship\r\n\r\nbecause many of our citizens are not from here and  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  have less than 10 years' residence.  This\r\n\r\n10-year   residential  qualification,  Sir,   is   only\r\n\r\nrequired  for  those  who  are  applying  for   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship under the naturalisation laws. Sir, I  must\r\n\r\nemphasise that the majority of those Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nwho  were not born here have acquired their citizenship\r\n\r\nby  virture of the eight-year residential qualification\r\n\r\nin  1957. That is by now four years later. These people\r\n\r\nhave  already been residing here for 12 years,  and  by\r\n\r\n1963, when merger is supposed to take place, they  will\r\n\r\nhave  at  least 14 years' residence. Sir, these  people\r\n\r\nwill  have, in fact, four years in excess of their  10-year  residential  qualification.  The  only  group  of\r\n\r\npeople   who   do  not  have  the  10-year  residential\r\n\r\nqualification  are those who were born  either  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  or in the  United  Kingdom  and\r\n\r\nColonies.  Sir,  we have already put forth  a  question\r\n\r\nasking  for the exact number of Singapore citizens  who\r\n\r\nrequire  citizenship  by this  provision  of  the  1957\r\n\r\nSingapore Citizenship Ordinance, and as you know,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  refused to give these figures on  the  grounds\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey were not available.

He\r\n\r\nwas unable to give the information because it was not\r\n\r\navailable. I think the hon.

I was\r\n\r\nsaying  that we know that the number of this  group  of\r\n\r\npeople is very small, between 20,000 and 30,000 people,\r\n\r\nand  most of them were born in Malaya and could not  be\r\n\r\nconsidered as foreigners anyway. Sir, they were born in\r\n\r\na  country with whom we are trying to merge. So how can\r\n\r\nwe grudge them Federal citizenship rights? These people\r\n\r\nwere  born  in the Federation, and are able to  qualify\r\n\r\nfor  Federal  citizenship  under  the  present  Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution   with   only  a   five-year   residential\r\n\r\nqualification    and   not   a   10-year    residential\r\n\r\nqualification. Apart from this, Sir, the rest  of  this\r\n\r\ngroup of about 20,000 to 30,000 Singapore citizens  are\r\n\r\nthose ex-servicemen and expatriates who have chosen  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  Singapore citizenship, and  their  number  is\r\n\r\nvery,  very  small, probably only a few thousand.  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  this  few  thousand, all  the  630,000-odd\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens are going to be deprived of  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights. What kind of lame excuse is this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of automatic Federal citizenship\r\n\r\nrights  for all Singapore citizens on merger  has  been\r\n\r\ndealt  with in great detail by my colleague, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown, and I do not wish to repeat what he has\r\n\r\nsaid, though\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  regrettable that the English  Press - the\r\n\r\nStraits   Times - unlike  the  non-English  Press,   has\r\n\r\ncompletely  blacked  out  the  detailed  but  extremely\r\n\r\nimportant arguments put forward by him on this question\r\n\r\nof  citizenship.  Sir, I wish to  say  here  that  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  is  an extremely important medium  of  public\r\n\r\nexpression  in the State. But by itself  the  value  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly as a medium of public expression is very\r\n\r\nlimited, for only a few score of members of the  public\r\n\r\ncan  be  accommodated  in the  Gallery  each  day.  Its\r\n\r\nusefulness  therefore,  Sir,  depends  heavily   on   a\r\n\r\nresponsible Press which will report justly  and  fairly\r\n\r\non  the  proceedings. But unfortunately, Sir, the  only\r\n\r\nEnglish  newspaper in the country has now,  like  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore,  become virtually the private mouthpiece  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you may know, on 21st November, 1961, at 10.30 p.m., Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore gave a half-hour report  on  the\r\n\r\nproceedings of this Assembly, and though the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  spoke for 3\ufffd hours that day,  whereas  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance spoke for barely one  hour,  the\r\n\r\nentire  half-hour report was devoted only to the speech\r\n\r\nof the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Since the Minister for Culture appears  to  be\r\n\r\nallergic  when  Radio Singapore is mentioned,  I  shall\r\n\r\nconfine my remarks to the Straits Times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to appeal to all\r\n\r\nnewspapers  in the country, and to the radio  as  well,\r\n\r\nthat  at least on this vital issue of merger, let there\r\n\r\nbe  fair and just reporting of the proceedings of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Let  the  public be  as  fully  informed  as\r\n\r\npossible  on  this extremely important issue  which  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  affect not only the present  generation  but\r\n\r\nalso future generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I was saying, this citizenship question is the\r\n\r\ncrux of the whole matter. It is the most vital issue in\r\n\r\nmerger.   It  is  by  a  careful  study  of   all   the\r\n\r\nimplications  of this arrangement for separate  citizen\r\n\r\nship  under the P.A.P.'s phoney merger that we will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  realise  the  extent  of  the  treachery  and\r\n\r\nbetrayal  of the P.A.P. Government. That is  why,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Government-controlled Radio Singapore and the pro-Government  Straits  Times have  so  carefully  avoided\r\n\r\nreporting  all  the ugly revelations  of  the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\ncitizenship arrangement. Sir, it is on the crux of this\r\n\r\nwhole  matter that the P.A.P. have tried to  bluff  the\r\n\r\npeople wholesale. The P.A.P. have tried to achieve this\r\n\r\nby  deliberately misleading and misinforming the people\r\n\r\non constitutional facts and citizenship laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to avoid repetition, I merely wish to summarise\r\n\r\nthe  salient  points in the argument.  Sir,  under  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  sellout arrangement, Singapore citizens  will\r\n\r\nbe kept isolated from the rest of the Federation people\r\n\r\nby  being  given a separate citizenship. This  separate\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is unique only to the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand will not be shared by the rest of the people in the\r\n\r\nother  11  States of the Federation. After this  phoney\r\n\r\nmerger, Sir, Singapore citizens will not be allowed  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in political activities in the  Federation\r\n\r\nbecause  they will not have Federal citizenship rights,\r\n\r\nalthough they will be so-called Federal nationals.  The\r\n\r\ncitizens of the 11 other States of the Federation will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall share common citizenship rights, which are separate\r\n\r\naltogether  from Singapore citizenship rights.  Thus  a\r\n\r\ncitizen,   say  from  Johore,  will  be   entitled   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in political activities throughout  the  11\r\n\r\nStates  in the Federation - something which the Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  will  not  be  able  to  do.  The  fact  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens and Federal citizens will  share  a\r\n\r\ncommon  nationality is irrelevant here, because  within\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  what  matters  is  not  your  Federal\r\n\r\nnationality but your Federal citizenship, without which\r\n\r\nyou  will,  for  practical purposes, be treated  as  an\r\n\r\nalien,  Though in theory Federal citizens will  not  be\r\n\r\nentitled  to  participate  in political  activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  in  practice  we  can  be  sure  they  will\r\n\r\ninterfere  wholesale  in  the political  activities  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  simply because the Central Government  will\r\n\r\nbe under the control of the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this right to have full participation in the\r\n\r\npolitical   life   of  a  nation  is   something   very\r\n\r\nfundamental  in  any  parliamentary democratic  set-up.\r\n\r\nSir, when we asked for this basic democratic right  for\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore,  we  were  accused  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture that we are asking for this  right\r\n\r\nbecause  we in the Barisan Sosialis wish to  stand  for\r\n\r\nelection  in the Federation, and that it is because  of\r\n\r\nthis personal political interest that we are trying  to\r\n\r\noppose  the  P.A.P.'s  phoney  merger  proposals.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, this is an utter and complete distortion\r\n\r\nof  the truth. It is regrettable that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  could not refrain from being personal even  in\r\n\r\nhis political analysis. [Interruption] In fact, most of\r\n\r\nhis  so-called  political analysis has  been  based  on\r\n\r\npersonalities.  I believe he is the author  of  several\r\n\r\narticles in the various anniversary publications of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. which sought to give credit for the success  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. at  the previous election  solely  to  the\r\n\r\nintelligence and genuine of the P.A.P. leadership,  and\r\n\r\nnot  to the objective political factors as well as  the\r\n\r\ndedication  and work of the thousands of the  rank  and\r\n\r\nfile of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I was saying, this fundamental right to a\r\n\r\ncommon  political life with one's fellow  brothers  and\r\n\r\nsisters  of  the  same nation is not a  matter  of  the\r\n\r\npersonal  interest of politicians. I  cannot,  however,\r\n\r\nsay  for  sure that the Prime Minister is  not  himself\r\n\r\ninterested  in  seeking new political pastures  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. [Interruption] For the Minister of  Culture\r\n\r\nknows that our Prime Minister is to be found more often\r\n\r\nin  the Federation than in Singapore these days.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite sure, Sir, that in the next general elections  he\r\n\r\nwill  not dare to go back to Tanjong Pagar. This common\r\n\r\npolitical  life  is  the mechanics,  the  framework  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. It is the means by  which  the\r\n\r\npeople of a country can influence and be influenced  by\r\n\r\none   another  so  that  they  can  together  elect   a\r\n\r\ngovernment  that  will  truly  reflect  the  views  and\r\n\r\naspirations of the people as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this common political life is an extremely\r\n\r\ndemocratic   channel   whereby   the   grievances   and\r\n\r\naspirations of any section of our people can  be  fully\r\n\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, supposing after reunification the extremely\r\n\r\ndemocratic  channel whereby that the Central Government\r\n\r\nis  not  caring  for  their interest  and  that  it  is\r\n\r\nadopting  a repressive policy towards them,  then  they\r\n\r\nshould have the right to inform the rest of the Malayan\r\n\r\npeople of their injustices and neglect at the hands  of\r\n\r\nthe  Central Government. They should have the right  to\r\n\r\npersuade the rest of the Malayan people to elect a  new\r\n\r\ngovernment which will look after the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore as well. Without  this  right  of\r\n\r\nmutual  influence to mutual benefit, how are the people\r\n\r\nof  the other eleven States in the Federation going  to\r\n\r\nknow  whether  the Central Government  is  treating  us\r\n\r\nfairly and squarely? They may well be mistaken that the\r\n\r\nCentral   Government   is,  in  fact,   looking   after\r\n\r\neverybody's  interest  equally  and  fairly,  and   may\r\n\r\nmerrily reelect the same Government next time. This  is\r\n\r\nespecially so in the context of a situation wherein the\r\n\r\nPress  and  the radio are nothing but mere servile  and\r\n\r\nwilling handmaids of those in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, under the P.A.P.'s-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In other words, Sir, as my colleague  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown has pointed  out,  we  will  be\r\n\r\ntreated  as  outcasts, where our influence in  national\r\n\r\npan-Malayan affairs will be kept at a minimum: firstly,\r\n\r\nby  political isolation, and secondly, by  being  given\r\n\r\nless   than   proportionate   representation   in   the\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So while the people of Singapore cannot influence the\r\n\r\npeople of the Federation under this phoney merger,  the\r\n\r\npeople of the Federation will, in practice, be able  to\r\n\r\ncome and influence the people of Singapore, even though\r\n\r\nthey  will  not have Singapore citizenship.  Even  now,\r\n\r\nSir,  before  any  sort of merger,  either  genuine  or\r\n\r\nphoney,   has   taken  place,  Federation  politicians,\r\n\r\nnotably  members  of  the ruling  Alliance  Party,  are\r\n\r\nfrequently  in Singapore making speeches and addressing\r\n\r\nrallies.

But, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish  to  assure\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not  that we mind in  the  least  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens  coming to Singapore to influence  our  people\r\n\r\nhere.  In  fact, we welcome them here as  brothers  and\r\n\r\nsisters of the same family. But the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  in  turn  be  treated on  the  same  footing.  No\r\n\r\nrelationship  based entirely on one-sided benefits  can\r\n\r\ngive any lasting happiness to the peoples concerned. It\r\n\r\nis  bound to cause some degree of jealousy and tension,\r\n\r\nwhich will increase as the days go by, until one day it\r\n\r\nmay   lead   to  the  complete  severance  of  whatever\r\n\r\nrelationship that may originally have existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Tunku realises that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  not  be happy with  this  relationship\r\n\r\nbased  on inequality. The Tunku, Sir, unlike our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, is a gentleman with warm human feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Three cheers for the big boy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You should have been here a bit earlier, but\r\n\r\nI cannot understand what -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I know that among wide sections  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, the name of Lee Kuan Yew is held in contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., Sir, alleges that in a complete and\r\n\r\ngenuine  merger,  only  about  half  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  were  born here would  automatically  be\r\n\r\ngranted Federal citizenship rights, and that the  other\r\n\r\nhalf  of  our  citizens who were not  born  here  would\r\n\r\nautomatically lose their citizenship status  and  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  apply for Federal citizenship.  So  says  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. But, Sir, may I ask: what proportion of citizens\r\n\r\nwill automatically get Federal citizenship rights under\r\n\r\nthe  proposed P.A.P. brand of merger? The answer,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis  n-o-n-e. Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact is  that  under\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s  phoney merger, not  a  single  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen  will  have  the  right  to  automatic  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship. In fact, Sir, even those born in Singapore\r\n\r\nafter  this  phoney  merger will  not  be  entitled  to\r\n\r\nautomatic Federal citizenship. All that they will  have\r\n\r\nwill  be Singapore State citizenship, just like  anyone\r\n\r\nborn  in  Singapore today. How then can  any  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen  obtain the coveted status of a Federal citizen\r\n\r\nafter this phoney merger which the P.A.P. is attempting\r\n\r\nto  ram  down  our throats? We will have to  apply  for\r\n\r\nFederal citizenship under the citizenship laws  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation as they are today. However, before one could\r\n\r\nso  apply,  several  pre-conditions  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\ncomplied with. The Singapore citizen must first go  and\r\n\r\nstay  in  the Federation for at least ten years.  After\r\n\r\ncompleting a stay of ten years, he will have to pass  a\r\n\r\nMalay  language test. Then, Sir, he has to satisfy  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government that he is of good character, and\r\n\r\nby  this,  of course, Sir, is meant that his  political\r\n\r\nviews must be acceptable to the Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope, Sir, the English newspaper, the\r\n\r\nStraits Times, will not black-out this once again.  The\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore have a right  to  know  the  full\r\n\r\nimplications  of this proposed phoney merger,  and  the\r\n\r\npapers of a country have a great duty - to inform them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfairly and truthfully. Unfortunately, Sir, the English-educated section of our people have no alternative  but\r\n\r\nto depend on the pro-Government Straits Times for their\r\n\r\ninformation. The Straits Times should realise that  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated  too have a right to  know  the  whole\r\n\r\ntruth about their future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queenstown has\r\n\r\nchallenged  the Government to deny the implications  of\r\n\r\ntheir  phoney  merger. I am sure the public  will  have\r\n\r\nnoted,  Sir,  that up till now the Government  has  not\r\n\r\ndenied this ugly revelation. They cannot deny it,  Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  it is simply the ugly truth, and they find  it  so\r\n\r\ninjurious even to hear it if they choose to be outside.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is  obvious that the P.A.P. has attempted  to\r\n\r\ncover  all  these ugly truths by trying to mislead  the\r\n\r\npeople by using such vague talk as being equal under  a\r\n\r\ncommon Federal nationality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. is trying to camouflage its sell-out\r\n\r\nproposals by trying to mislead the people into\r\n\r\nbelieving that there is no material difference between\r\n\r\nFederal citizen and Federal national. Sir, the\r\n\r\nGovernment issued on 25th November a statement to\r\n\r\nexplain the opinion given by the State Advocate-General. But, Sir, -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the document which was\r\n\r\ntabled by the Prime Minister on the 24th November for\r\n\r\ncirculation to Members of the Legislative Assembly was\r\n\r\ndated 23rd November, 1961. If that is correct, then the\r\n\r\nstatement that the Government issued the circular on\r\n\r\nthe 25th November is not quite correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am sorry. When I said \"the 25th\", I meant\r\n\r\nthe date on which it was published in the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, this so-called explanatory statement added\r\n\r\nmany  things  which  the  State Advocate-General  never\r\n\r\nsaid.  For instance, Sir, the explanatory note referred\r\n\r\nto  the first Merdeka Talks in London in 1956 when  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Ching  Siong  was alleged to have  agreed  to  the\r\n\r\nproposals  by  the  then  Chief  Minister.  Mr   David\r\n\r\nMarshall,  who  is  now  the Member  for  Anson.  These\r\n\r\nproposals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere actually a set of citizenship laws designed for an\r\n\r\nindependent sovereign State of Singapore; a citizenship\r\n\r\nstatus  that  was to be called \"national of Singapore\",\r\n\r\nThey  were put up by the Singapore delegation,  present\r\n\r\namong   whom  were  also  our  Prime  Minister.   These\r\n\r\nproposals,  as  we know, were rejected by  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the whole intention behind this mischievous\r\n\r\nreference  is  very  clear. It is  to  convey  a  false\r\n\r\nimpression  to  the public that Mr  Lirn  Ching  Siong\r\n\r\nagreed  in  1956  to  the people of Singapore  becoming\r\n\r\nnationals,  and the P.A.P. hopes to confuse the  public\r\n\r\ninto believing that Mr Lim Ching Siong has now changed\r\n\r\nhis  line. Sir, nothing is further from the truth.  You\r\n\r\nwill note, Sir, that the term \"Singapore nationals\" was\r\n\r\nused   in  the  proposals  of  1956  to  mean  a  State\r\n\r\ncitizenship  status for the people of Singapore  as  an\r\n\r\nindependent  and sovereign State, and not in  reference\r\n\r\nto  Federal  citizenship.  Whereas  now,  Sir,  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of merger, the term \"Federal national\" is being\r\n\r\nused by the P.A.P. to try to make us believe that it is\r\n\r\na  substitute for Federal citizenship, which we know is\r\n\r\nnot  true.  There is absolutely no relevance whatsoever\r\n\r\nin  that  mischievous reference except to add confusion\r\n\r\nto the whole matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the State Advocate-General, Inche Ahmad bin\r\n\r\nIbrahim,  has  given  a  legal  opinion  on  the   term\r\n\r\n\"national\" of the new Federation. I regret to say, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat the statement has not helped to clarify the issue.\r\n\r\nHe  has not added anything new to what has been said on\r\n\r\nthe  subject.  The Sunday Times of the  26th  November.\r\n\r\n1961,  has, of course, tried to make political  capital\r\n\r\nfor  the Government by emphasising, in one sentence  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government's interpretation of the State Advocate-General's  opinion, that the two words  \"national\"  and\r\n\r\n\"citizen\" have the same meaning. Thus, Sir, the  Sunday\r\n\r\nTimes,  which  is part and parcel of the Straits  Times\r\n\r\norganisation,  is  trying to sell the Government  line.\r\n\r\nThat is, to be a Federal national is the same as to  be\r\n\r\na Federal citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the State Advocate-General; Sir, in fact, did not\r\n\r\nstate  categorically in his statement  that  the  terms\r\n\r\n\"national\" and \"citizen\" had the same meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This is what it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He [that is the State Advocate-General] said that\r\n\r\nthere appeared to be no distinction between the terms\r\n\r\n\"nationality\" and \"citizenship\" for the purposes of the\r\n\r\nBritish Nationality Act, 1948. However, it was\r\n\r\npermissable to use the term \"nationality\" for the\r\n\r\npurposes of international law and the term\r\n\r\n\"citizenship\" for the purposes of national or municipal\r\n\r\nlaw, he added.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  in  the  same  paper, we have  a  report  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  explanatory statement which  subsequently\r\n\r\nfollows - I  read from the Straits Times  of  the  same\r\n\r\ndate, Sir:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An explanatory Government statement today said that\r\n\r\nin  non-legal  language,  the State  Advocate-General's\r\n\r\nopinion  meant that the terms \"citizen\" and  \"national\"\r\n\r\nhave the same meaning.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  please note that it was the Government's so-called\r\n\r\nexplanatory  statement  and  not  the  State  Advocate-General's  opinion that stated that the two words  have\r\n\r\nthe same meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that a great deal\r\n\r\nof  confusion has resulted from the fact that  the  two\r\n\r\nwords  \"national\" and \"citizen\" have been used at times\r\n\r\nto  mean the same thing. But, Sir, what is important is\r\n\r\nnot the word that is being used to describe a political\r\n\r\nstatus  but  the  significance of the political  status\r\n\r\nitself. Sir, the only significant paragraph in the long\r\n\r\nstatement  of the S.A.G. - a statement full of legalistic\r\n\r\njargon - is this paragraph. Let me quote again, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nSunday Times of the 26th. It said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The term \"citizen\" was usually used in reference to a\r\n\r\nperson's  domestic or internal rights within a country,\r\n\r\nand \"national\" was usually used in reference to a man's\r\n\r\ninternational standing and status.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, this is exactly what the Member for Queenstown has\r\n\r\nsaid.  Let  me  quote the relevant part of  his  speech\r\n\r\nwhere  he  was  discussing the difference  between  the\r\n\r\nterms \"citizen\" and \"national\". He said, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"Citizenship\" and \"nationality\" are two distinct\r\n\r\nconcepts.  \"Citizenship\"  expresses  the  right  of  an\r\n\r\nindividual within a State and \"nationality\" is a  right\r\n\r\noutside the State.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  what  the P.A.P. is trying to confuse the  people\r\n\r\nwith  is the fact that these two concepts, namely, your\r\n\r\nright  within  a  -  State and your right  outside  the\r\n\r\nState, have sometimes been described by the same thing.\r\n\r\nThat  is to say, Sir, the word \"citizen\" has been  used\r\n\r\nsometimes  to  mean your rights inside  the  State  and\r\n\r\nsometimes  to  mean your rights outside  the  State.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  the word \"national\" has been used  to  mean\r\n\r\neither of these two concepts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as I can see, in the British commonwealth\r\n\r\nthough there is a different set of citizenship laws for\r\n\r\neach of, the different Commonwealth countries, there is\r\n\r\nonly  one overall common nationality. That is  to  say,\r\n\r\nwhether you are a citizen of Australia or a citizen  of\r\n\r\nCanada,  you are both a British Commonwealth  national.\r\n\r\nThe  confusing thing is that this concept of an overall\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  nationality for all the citizens  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious Commonwealth countries has been given the legal\r\n\r\ntitle   of   \"Commonwealth  citizenship\",  instead   of\r\n\r\n\"Commonwealth  nationality\". What  is  more  confusing,\r\n\r\nSir,   as  the  State  Advocate-General  has  correctly\r\n\r\npointed out, is that - let me quote him in the same issue\r\n\r\nof the Sunday Times - he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Some Commonwealth countries use the term \"national\"\r\n\r\nto describe their citizens.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the  word \"national\" is being used  in  different\r\n\r\ncountries  to  mean different thing. It  is  something,\r\n\r\nSir,  like  the word \"dollar\". A dollar in Hongkong  is\r\n\r\nworth  only  about  half  the  Singapore  dollar.  When\r\n\r\nsomeone wants to give us a dollar, one usually means  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar.  But  when  these  desperate  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npoliticians, who are politically bankrupt, offer  us  a\r\n\r\ndollar,  we  must  be careful for they  are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\ntrying  to  pass  off  Hongkong dollars  for  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

They\r\n\r\nhave  a right to know exactly what deal they are going\r\n\r\nto  get Sir, this whole confusion, as I understand  it,\r\n\r\nhas   resulted  from  the  loose  usage  of  the  terms\r\n\r\n\"national\" and \"citizen\" to mean either of one  of  two\r\n\r\nconcepts that I have mentioned. No one is to be  blamed\r\n\r\nfor this confusion, Sir, except the lawyers who seem to\r\n\r\nhave  a  vested interest to make their profession  look\r\n\r\nall  very  complicated and respectable.  Sir,  what  is\r\n\r\ncontemptible is this deliberate attempt by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto  cash  in on this confusion in the use of the  words\r\n\r\nto  smuggle  in  a  set of political  rights  that  are\r\n\r\ncompletely  different  from  those  possessed  by   the\r\n\r\ncitizens of the other eleven States of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not a lawyer, and as a layman, I am not\r\n\r\ninterested   in  all  these  legalistic  and   academic\r\n\r\nquibbles on the usage of mere words. Neither am I nor I\r\n\r\nam  sure,  are  the  people  interested  in  all  these\r\n\r\nmeaningless  verbal intricacies. What  the  people  are\r\n\r\ninterested  in  is not whether one is to  be  called  a\r\n\r\n\"national\"  or a \"citizen\", but whether one  is  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the same rights and privileges as those  enjoyed\r\n\r\nby  the  people  of  the  other eleven  States  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Call  these political rights  by  whatever\r\n\r\nname, Sir, - be it national, citizen, new citizen or what\r\n\r\nhave you - but the important thing is that there must  be\r\n\r\na  common  citizenship for all the  people  of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nincluding  Singapore,  on merger.  Merger  cannot  mean\r\n\r\nanything  else.  The present arrangement  for  separate\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  Sir, is in direct contradiction  to  the.\r\n\r\nconcept of merger and, in fact, nullifies it. What  the\r\n\r\npeople  want after merger is that they will also  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe rights and privileges now enjoyed by the people  of\r\n\r\nthe   Federation,   particularly  Federal   citizenship\r\n\r\nrights,  which are fundamental to all those who  regard\r\n\r\nMalaya  as their home. That is what they want and  that\r\n\r\nis  what every responsible leader of our people  should\r\n\r\nask for.

That is  the  point,\r\n\r\nSir. That is the substance of the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Barisan Sosialis are realists and we are\r\n\r\ninterested only in the substance of the issue  and  not\r\n\r\nin  names.  The  people  of Singapore  are  politically\r\n\r\nmature. They can differentiate mere names from the real\r\n\r\nsubstance of the issue. The people of Singapore realise\r\n\r\nthat the status of Federal national is useful only when\r\n\r\nthey  go  abroad. But it is meaningless when  they  are\r\n\r\nwithin the country, for within the country what matters\r\n\r\nis  the  citizenship status. It is no use  telling  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore that when they go abroad, they will\r\n\r\nbe  regarded in foreign countries as being equal as the\r\n\r\npeople  of  the Federation. We know that the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the Federation will be  possessing  the\r\n\r\nsame  passport. But what is the use of being equal just\r\n\r\nOutside one's country and not being equal inside  one's\r\n\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown has aptly described\r\n\r\nthis  whole  arrangement  as just  a  showcase  to  the\r\n\r\noutside   world  - the  pretence  that  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaya are all united and equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. is inventing this new term, \"Federal\r\n\r\nnational\",  to  hide the fact that what the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore will possess after the phoney merger is  just\r\n\r\na  State  citizenship and not a Federal citizenship  as\r\n\r\npossessed by the people of the other 11 States.  If  it\r\n\r\nis  indeed true that we are going to become equal  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federal citizens, then why do not the P.A.P. just\r\n\r\ngrant us all Federal citizenship rights? Why do not  on\r\n\r\nmerger  all  Singapore citizens  be  known  as  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens?   Why   must   the  P.A.P. invent   a   new\r\n\r\nterm - \"Federal national\" - which is not found in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent  Federal  Constitution?

But, in the first place, they were not\r\n\r\nadequate  answers.  In  the  second  place,  since  the\r\n\r\nMinisters fought shy of answering these questions,  let\r\n\r\nme  provide the answers. They can then either accept or\r\n\r\ndeny them as they think fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was saying that these are what will happen to\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore under the phoney merger of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Singapore citizens will retain their State\r\n\r\ncitizenship - something which they already have. The only\r\n\r\nnew  thing  they  will  have is the  so-called  Federal\r\n\r\nnational  status.  This Federal nationality  will  give\r\n\r\nthem nothing new except a Federal passport instead of a\r\n\r\nBritish passport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Singapore citizens will be allowed to send only 15\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to the Federal Parliament,  when  they\r\n\r\nshould be entitled to at least 25 Members in the  House\r\n\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The P.A.P.'s pseudo merger, if it materialises,\r\n\r\nwill   not  enable  any  Singapore  citizen  to  become\r\n\r\nautomatically a Federal citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Not even those Singapore citizens born in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill have the automatic right to Federal citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. In fact, even those who will be born in Singapore\r\n\r\nafter  this  phoney merger will not be entitled  as  of\r\n\r\nright  to become Federal citizens. What they will  have\r\n\r\nwill  be  just Singapore State citizenship like  anyone\r\n\r\nborn in Singapore under the present situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Singapore citizens will not have the right to vote\r\n\r\nand  stand  for election when they go to the Federation\r\n\r\nafter this phoney merger. In fact, they will be treated\r\n\r\nlike foreigners there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The only way for Singapore citizens to obtain\r\n\r\nFederal  citizenship after this P.A.P.'s phoney  merger\r\n\r\nis that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) He must go and stay in the Federation for\r\n\r\nanother 10 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) He must pass a Malay language test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Satisfy the Federation Government that he is of\r\n\r\ngood  character.  That  is,  Sir,  his  political\r\n\r\nviews,  must  be  acceptable  to  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he has to apply just like any\r\n\r\nforeigner or alien. The fact that he will be a  Federal\r\n\r\nnational will be completely irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the seven main important political\r\n\r\nimplications of this phoney merger, which  everyone  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  must  know. But, Sir, there are  also  other\r\n\r\nimportant implications:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Unlike Federal citizens, Singapore citizens will\r\n\r\nnot  be  able  to apply for jobs direct in the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment  service. Their lack of Federal  citizenship\r\n\r\nwill  be a discriminating factor against them.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, Federal citizens will have the  right,  in\r\n\r\npractice  though  not  in theory,  to  obtain  jobs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government service just as  they  are  doing\r\n\r\nright now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The workers of Singapore will not be able to apply\r\n\r\nfor  jobs  in  the Federation on an equal footing  with\r\n\r\nFederal citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The products of Singapore schools and universities\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  treated  on the same  footing  as  their\r\n\r\nFederation counterparts when they apply for jobs in the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Singapore citizens will not be able to move freely\r\n\r\nin the Federation. They can be easily barred from going\r\n\r\nacross the Causeway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Singapore citizens will not have full freedom of\r\n\r\nspeech  and  expression  in the  Federation.  Singapore\r\n\r\npublications will not be allowed to circulate freely in\r\n\r\nthe Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Students from Singapore schools and universities\r\n\r\nwill  not  have  the  right to  travel  freely  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  intermingle with Federation students,  and\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  students movements in  the  Federation\r\n\r\nwithout  discrimination. In fact,  the  same  situation\r\n\r\nwill remain for them as it is now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. The workers of Singapore and of the Federation\r\n\r\nwill not be allowed to form Pan-Malayan trade unions so\r\n\r\nthat they can unite and strengthen the organisations in\r\n\r\ntheir struggle to improve their livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. The people of Singapore and the people of the\r\n\r\nFederation  will  not be permitted to form  Pan-Malayan\r\n\r\npolitical Parties and social organisations in order  to\r\n\r\nbring about unity and common\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunderstanding  to  our  peoples  and  to  advance   our\r\n\r\ninterests as one united people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And last, but not the least, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.

This  bluff,\r\n\r\nSir,  was completely exposed by the Member for  Queenstown. In his speech, Sir, the Minister for Finance  had\r\n\r\nat  long  last  admitted that it was possible  for  all\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore to become automatically citizens\r\n\r\nof  the Federation of Malaya, though he said that  this\r\n\r\nwas  only  an  academic possibility. Sir, whatever  the\r\n\r\nmerits  of  the Minister for Finance are, I can  safely\r\n\r\nsay  that intellectual honesty is not one of them,  for\r\n\r\nif  he  had known that it was constitutionally possible\r\n\r\nfor  automatic  conversion  of  Singapore  citizens  to\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens on merger then why  did  he,  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place,  Sir,  try to bluff our  people  in  such\r\n\r\ncategorical   terms   that  it   was   constitutionally\r\n\r\nimpossible?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will have noticed that one by\r\n\r\none  the  excuses  put up by the P.A.P.  Government  to\r\n\r\navoid  fighting for full equal citizenship  rights  for\r\n\r\nall  Singapore  citizens, on the basis  that  they  all\r\n\r\nbecome  automatic  Federal  citizens,  were  completely\r\n\r\nexposed  by  the  Member  for  Queenstown.  As  he  has\r\n\r\nsummarised, the P.A.P.'s line of bluff was as  follows:\r\n\r\nfirstly,  automatic conversion of Singapore citizenship\r\n\r\nto Federal citizenship was supposed to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstitutionally  impossible.  Then  when   we   quoted\r\n\r\nchapter  and  verse  and  Article  26  of  the  Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution,  the P.A.P. changed its  line,  and  said\r\n\r\nthat it was politically unreasonable to demand for full\r\n\r\nFederal  citizenship rights for all Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\nThen  later it became a question of having to  register\r\n\r\nfor  citizenship  all over again and to  pass  a  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  test.  So  one  by  one  these  bluffs   were\r\n\r\ncompletely exposed by the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the P.A.P. Government now puts up yet another\r\n\r\nbluff  which  was not heard by the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nbefore.  And  this new bluff, Sir, is put  up  by  none\r\n\r\nother  than  the Minister for Finance himself  when  he\r\n\r\nsaid that the real reason why the Federation refuses to\r\n\r\naccept  automatic conversion of all Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nto  Federal citizen on merger is that there are certain\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  who are Communists  and  who  will\r\n\r\nbecome  Federal citizens by this automatic  conversion.\r\n\r\nHence  it  is  to  prevent these Communists,  who  have\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship  rights, from  becoming  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens on merger that the Tunku has refused  to  give\r\n\r\nFederal  citizenship  rights  to  all  the  630,000-odd\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have never heard the Tunku say this. And for\r\n\r\nall  we know, it may yet be another fast one which  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance is trying to put over  us.  But,\r\n\r\nSir,  if it is really true that this is the real reason\r\n\r\nwhy the Tunku does not want all Singapore citizens  to\r\n\r\nbecome Federal citizens on merger, then we actually see\r\n\r\nno   difficulty  whatsoever  in  meeting  the   Tunku's\r\n\r\nrequirements,  namely,  that no Singapore  citizen  who\r\n\r\nalso  happens to be a Communist should become a Federal\r\n\r\ncitizen.  Sir, as the Minister for Finance himself  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  between  God and the Communists,  there  is  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Barisan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, we have also heard the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ntelling us sometime ago that he believed there are only 300   Communists  \r\n\r\nin  Singapore.

The way then  would  be\r\n\r\nclear  for  all  the rest of the 630,000-odd  citizens,\r\n\r\nprovided,  of  course, the Special  Branch - or  whatever\r\n\r\nother Intelligence service the Government has - does  not\r\n\r\nmake  the same mistake as it made in the case of  Tommy\r\n\r\nKoh.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of the Barisan Sosialis, I wish to state\r\n\r\nhere categorically that if this is the real reason  why\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku refuses to accept all Singapore citizens  as\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens on merger - namely, to prevent  certain\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens who happen also  to  be  Communists\r\n\r\nfrom  becoming  Federal  citizens - then  let  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister prove these 300 citizens to be Communists  and\r\n\r\ndeprive   them  of  their  citizenship,  so  that   the\r\n\r\nremainder of the 630,000 Singapore citizens will be\r\n\r\ngiven  automatic  right  to  Federal  citizenship   on\r\n\r\nmerger.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we sincerely hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance will have no more excuses  after\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has said that Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship, after this phoney merger, will  not  be  a\r\n\r\nsecond-class  citizenship.  I  regret,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  was  being  too  academic  in   his\r\n\r\napproach.  It  may be true, from the legal  standpoint,\r\n\r\nthat   there   is   no  such  thing   as   second-class\r\n\r\ncitizenship. I am not a lawyer, Sir, and  I  look  upon\r\n\r\ncitizenship, as I said before, from the viewpoint of  a\r\n\r\nlayman.  And  to  the  layman, if  he  finds  that  his\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is  of  value only  within  the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and becomes valueless the moment he steps out\r\n\r\nof  his  own  State and into the other  States  of  the\r\n\r\nnation,  then  he will realise that there is  something\r\n\r\nlacking  in his own citizenship, especially, Sir,  when\r\n\r\nhe  finds  that  the  citizenship status  possessed  by\r\n\r\npeople in the other States is recognised throughout the\r\n\r\neleven  States of the Federation. Sir, he will  realise\r\n\r\nthat his own citizenship is definitely inferior. If his\r\n\r\ncitizenship is inferior, therefore, it can be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  second-class. This may  not  be  legally\r\n\r\ntrue, but from the common-sense point of view, I do not\r\n\r\nthink the Member for Anson will disagree with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has brought up a very\r\n\r\nvaluable  point which unfortunately the  Straits  Times\r\n\r\ndid  not  think  fit  to  give  it  the  prominence  it\r\n\r\ndeserves. The point, Sir, is that even under the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nphoney merger, the 4:1 ratio will still apply to  these\r\n\r\nSingapore Government services which will become part of\r\n\r\nthe pan-Malayan Federal Departments, and that there is,\r\n\r\nin  fact, no difference whatsoever in this respect from\r\n\r\na complete merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not recollect the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  saying that under the \"phoney\" merger, all these\r\n\r\nthings  will  happen. I do not think he used  the  word\r\n\r\n\"phoney\".  I  think he used the words \"P.A.P. type  of\r\n\r\nmerger\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I agree with you, Sir. I think he said, in\r\n\r\nfact,  the  P.A.P. Government type of  merger.  But  in\r\n\r\ncontent and substance, Sir, we all know that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntype  of  merger is no merger, and that it is merely  a\r\n\r\nphoney merger. In other words, the 4:1 ratio will apply\r\n\r\nin  a  complete merger, as is also in the case  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. phoney merger, to those parts of the civil service\r\n\r\nwhich will come under Federal control. Thus, here, Sir,\r\n\r\nanother  P.A.P. bluff  against  complete  merger   was\r\n\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. also tried to frighten us\r\n\r\nfrom  demanding  complete merger  by  threatening  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's  free port status will be  destroyed  under\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger.  But  again  we  know  this   to   be\r\n\r\nabsolutely not true. Penang today is completely  merged\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation, and yet she is still maintaining\r\n\r\nher  free port status. All this goes to show the  utter\r\n\r\ninsincerity  of  the P.A.P. It goes to  show  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. does   not   want  a  complete   and   genuine\r\n\r\nreunification of the people, and because of this,  they\r\n\r\nwill  seek  every  excuse to frighten the  people  from\r\n\r\ncalling  for  a complete merger. It is quite  clear  to\r\n\r\neveryone, Sir, again for people even with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naverage  intelligence, that the people who are in  fact\r\n\r\nanti-merger are the P.A.P. themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, what the P.A.P. really wants is not\r\n\r\ntrue  merger but a phoney set-up which seeks  to  place\r\n\r\nthe  political destiny of the people of Singapore under\r\n\r\nthe  control  of the Government in the Federation  over\r\n\r\nwhich  the people of Singapore cannot exert appropriate\r\n\r\ninfluence. This aim, Sir, has already been made  clear.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. simply hopes that this phoney merger set-up\r\n\r\nwill help the P.A.P. to retain its political power. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leaders hope that the Federation Government, after\r\n\r\nthis  phoney merger, will put all the P.A.P. political\r\n\r\nopponents into gaol so that there will be no opposition\r\n\r\nwhatsoever, except the weaklings in the S.P.A., in  the\r\n\r\nnext election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no people will aspire to or strive for a\r\n\r\npolitical  change that will bring them no gain  or  for\r\n\r\none which will make their plight worse off. It need not\r\n\r\nbe  repeated,  Sir, that the people of  Singapore  have\r\n\r\nlong  aspired to be reunited with their brothers across\r\n\r\nthe Causeway. But, Sir, this aspiration, this aim, this\r\n\r\ngoal,  has  not been sought for nothing. Nor  have  the\r\n\r\npeople  longed  for merger as an empty manipulation  to\r\n\r\nkeep  afloat fast-sinking political bankrupts and turn-coats.  Sir,  the people seek and hope  for  a  genuine\r\n\r\nreunification of the two territories so that the united\r\n\r\ncountry  and  the people may have greater  freedom  and\r\n\r\ncommand   greater  strength  to  lead   better   lives.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, it is essential that the conditions for\r\n\r\nmerger  must be negotiated with the mutual welfare  and\r\n\r\nprogress  of the people of the two territories  as  the\r\n\r\nprimary  objective. There is nothing insurmountable  in\r\n\r\nthe way of negotiating a merger wherein the citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore will automatically become the citizens of the\r\n\r\nFederation.  We  can have nothing less than  this.  The\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore will never forgive any politician\r\n\r\nor group of politicians who dare do otherwise. There is\r\n\r\nnothing to prevent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnegotiation  on  the  question  of  automatic   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship being granted to all Singapore citizens. It\r\n\r\nis rightly a matter to be negotiated by the two peoples\r\n\r\ncoming together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who assume responsibility on behalf of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore have the duty  to  see  that  any\r\n\r\nsettlement  arrived at will achieve the  objectives  of\r\n\r\nmutual  welfare, progress, greater freedom and equality\r\n\r\nfor the people. Anything less than these will be a sell-out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, Sir, what the real intention of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is. They do not want a complete merger  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation. Therefore, each  time  we\r\n\r\ngive  some  reason to support a complete  merger,  they\r\n\r\nstart  giving another reason to show why we should  not\r\n\r\nhave complete merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a trade unionist. All these things remind me\r\n\r\nof  what  happen during negotiations between  employers\r\n\r\nand workers on matters which will advance the interests\r\n\r\nof  the  workers. In such negotiations, Sir,  you  will\r\n\r\nfind  that the workers' representatives will put  forth\r\n\r\narguments  to support the workers' case,  and  to  each\r\n\r\nsuch   argument  the  employers  will  put  up  another\r\n\r\nargument to show why the workers' interests should  not\r\n\r\nhe advanced. Similarly, Sir, on this merger negotiation\r\n\r\nwe  in  the  Barisan Sosialis have the support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Therefore,  we  put  up  arguments  that  will\r\n\r\nsupport  the  advancement  of our  people's  interests.\r\n\r\nWhereas  the P.A.P., which has now lost the support  of\r\n\r\nthe  people and whose political future depends now upon\r\n\r\nthe   support   of   the  Federation  Government,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore,  to every argument that is put  forward  for\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger, they have put up another argument  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Federation Government. It is quite clear,\r\n\r\nSir,  whom the Federation Government now represents  in\r\n\r\nthis merger negotiation. It is quite evident, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthey  are  more  keen to show why Singa, pore  citizens\r\n\r\nshould   not  have  equal  status  than  why  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  should have equal status. If  the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nsincere  in  wanting  to advance the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, why must it  keep  on  advancing\r\n\r\narguments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  will  deny  Singapore  citizens  the  right   to\r\n\r\nautomatic  Federal citizenship? In fact, Sir,  we  have\r\n\r\nseen  our  Prime Minister literally putting words  into\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku's  mouth in order to deprive  all  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  of the right to automatic Federal citizenship\r\n\r\non  merger.  He has said that the Tunku would  consider\r\n\r\nhim  dotty, if we were to put up the argument that  all\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  should  be  Federal  citizens   on\r\n\r\nmerger. Surely, Sir, the Tunku can speak for himself. I\r\n\r\nam quite certain that the Tunku is not so uncouth as to\r\n\r\ngo around calling people \"dotty\". Even in the letter by\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister of Singapore  to the Prime Minister of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  which was read out in this Assembly - I  believe\r\n\r\nit  was  on  Friday, Sir - we could see  that  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  was,  in  fact,  supplying  the  Tunku   with\r\n\r\narguments  why  Singapore  citizens  should  not   have\r\n\r\nautomatic Federal citizenship right on merger. You will\r\n\r\nnote,  Sir,  that our Prime Minister again referred  to\r\n\r\nthe  argument that if Singapore were to merge with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  like  Penang,  then  only  those  born   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  would have the right to Federal citizenship.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, Sir, our Prime Minister  was  arguing\r\n\r\nthat  if  Singapore were to merge with  the  Federation\r\n\r\nlike Penang, then Singapore should go in not as we  are\r\n\r\nnow, but as we were 16 years ago when we were separated\r\n\r\nand  when  we  did not have State citizenship.  Surely,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  people  of Singapore can  see  through  this\r\n\r\nridiculous  line of argument. Our Prime Minister  seems\r\n\r\nto  be more anxious to please the Federation Government\r\n\r\nthan  to please the people of Singapore. Whose side  is\r\n\r\nour   Prime  Minister  on?  On  whose  behalf   is   he\r\n\r\nnegotiating? The people of Singapore or the  Government\r\n\r\nof the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On behalf of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Just as the Prime Minister and the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance are anxious to negotiate on behalf of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the Federation of Malaya,  so  are  the\r\n\r\nMinisters for Labour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Law, Education and the Deputy Prime Minister.

The Minister for Culture, in his speech to this\r\n\r\nAssembly,   put   up  many  ridiculous  arguments.   He\r\n\r\ncontended that after the P.A.P.'s phoney merger,  since\r\n\r\nthe   Federation   citizens   cannot   have   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights  in as much as  Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\ncannot  have  Federal  citizenship  rights,  therefore,\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizens  are  as  unequal  as   Federation\r\n\r\ncitizens, and therefore, since both are unequals,  they\r\n\r\nare  equals. The whole Government benches,  I  believe,\r\n\r\nSir, laughed at this. I suppose they all thought it was\r\n\r\na  very  clever  arguments.

Sir,  what  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture contends is something like  this.\r\n\r\nIf  a family of 12 people decide to -treat one of their\r\n\r\nmembers as an outcast and confine him to live only in a\r\n\r\ndungeon,  therefore, since the other  11  members  live\r\n\r\nseparately  from  that  one poor  chap  living  in  the\r\n\r\ndungeon, they are as unequal as the poor chap living in\r\n\r\nthe  dungeon.

I respect him as  the\r\n\r\nelected Member of the people of Geylang Serai who  are\r\n\r\npredominantly  Malays. He is the  head  of  a  communal\r\n\r\nParty,  the  U.M.N.O.  This question  of  merger  is  a\r\n\r\nnational  issue that seeks to bring unity, harmony  and\r\n\r\npeace  to all our peoples irrespective of race,  colour\r\n\r\nand  creed.  I  therefore deeply regret that  on  this\r\n\r\nnational issue the Member for Geylang Serai should have\r\n\r\nmade  an emotional speech the other day. He has accused\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis of being communal on the basis  of\r\n\r\ngroundless accusations. It is not only regrettable  but\r\n\r\ncompletely despicable that the P.A.P., which  professes\r\n\r\nto  be a non-communal Party, also attempts to stir  up\r\n\r\ncommunal feelings during this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall first deal with these despicable P.A.P.\r\n\r\nattempts to stir up communal feelings and I shall  then\r\n\r\nlater discuss -calmly with the Member for Geylang Serai\r\n\r\non  what he has said. The P.A.P. has attempted to  sour\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  the  Barisan  Sosialis  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government and has attempted to  paint  our\r\n\r\ndifferences  with  the Federation Government  as  being\r\n\r\nbased on communalism. It has tried to stir up hostility\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation  against the  Barisan  Sosialis  by\r\n\r\nemphasising  that  we  aim  to  topple  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment on complete\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerger. They have said it in such a way as to  give  a\r\n\r\ncommunal  overtone to the whole matter. I said  earlier\r\n\r\nthat if the P.A.P. is sincerely a socialist Party, then\r\n\r\nthese  things  are precisely what they  should  do.  In\r\n\r\nfact, as has been pointed out, these were actually  the\r\n\r\nvery  same objectives of the P.A.P. in those days  when\r\n\r\nthey had the support of the people. Why is it that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leaders  are now harping on  these  matters  as\r\n\r\nthough they carry with them a communal bias?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has challenged us to state whether we\r\n\r\nsupport the Federation policies on education and labour\r\n\r\nunder  complete merger. This is absolute  nonsense.  We\r\n\r\nhave already very clearly stated our stand on education\r\n\r\nand  labour.  If the Government Ministers had  been  in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber  while  the  Member  for  Queenstown  was\r\n\r\ndelivering his speech, they would have known our  Party\r\n\r\nstand on these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just to elucidate them, allow me to quote the\r\n\r\npolicy  statement  of  my Party made  on  the  28th  of\r\n\r\nAugust, 1961:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We fully realise that many of the policies of the\r\n\r\npresent  Right-wing  Government in the  Federation  are\r\n\r\nunacceptable  to us. The present Federation  Government\r\n\r\nis in close alliance with foreign capital. It has bound\r\n\r\nthe  country  to  the  so-called British/Malaya  mutual\r\n\r\ndefence  treaty  and  turned  our  motherland  into   a\r\n\r\nmilitary  base  for British armed forces.  Its  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  has alienated our country from the main  stream\r\n\r\nof  Afro-Asia, particularly Indonesia, Ghana and India.\r\n\r\nIts  internal policies are repressive, particularly  to\r\n\r\ntrade  unions and intellectuals. Freedom of expression,\r\n\r\norganisation and other civil liberties are  curbed  and\r\n\r\nits  educational policy is misguided. Nevertheless,  we\r\n\r\nare  willing to accept these disabilities and  join  up\r\n\r\nwith the socialist forces in the Federation to build  a\r\n\r\ngreat alliance with peasants, workers and intellectuals\r\n\r\nto  defeat  by  constitutional  means  the  reactionary\r\n\r\nforces at the general elections. Our socialist comrades\r\n\r\nin   the  Federation  have  for  long  been  waging   a\r\n\r\ndetermined struggle against the reactionary  forces  of\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  Government.  We  will  strength  this\r\n\r\nstruggle by joining hands with the Federation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will note, Sir, that we have stated in categorical\r\n\r\nterms  that  as  a  Party  which  firmly  believes   in\r\n\r\nsocialism,  we cannot agree with the present Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment's -policies on labour, education  and  other\r\n\r\nmatters.

What we seek to  do  is  that\r\n\r\nafter  complete merger, we will utilise all the  normal\r\n\r\nconstitutional and democratic methods to  convince  the\r\n\r\npeople of Malaya that our policies are better and  hope\r\n\r\nthereby  to  effect  a change in these  policies.  That\r\n\r\nwould  appear, Sir, to be the normal democratic way  of\r\n\r\ndoing  things.  But  apparently it  is  something  very\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory to the P.A.P. which professes  to  be  a\r\n\r\nsocialist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we notice that the P.A.P., on the one hand, are\r\n\r\nactually  playing to communal feelings in Singapore  by\r\n\r\nharping  all  the time on the fact that  they  seek  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  Chinese education in Singapore; yet  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, they accuse us of being communal  when  we\r\n\r\nare  prepared  to  let the Federation  Government  have\r\n\r\ncomplete  control  of  our  educational  policy  in   a\r\n\r\ncomplete merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicly, the P.A.P. professes to be a non-communal\r\n\r\nParty. But we have noticed that in recent months it\r\n\r\nhas been playing a very dangerous communal line in\r\n\r\nlocal politics. We have known that the P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nin private have been using communal arguments in order\r\n\r\nto split the Malay members and the Chinese members of\r\n\r\nthe socialist movement in Malaya. We know that during\r\n\r\nthe period of the split within the rank and file of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., the Minister for Culture went to the Federation\r\n\r\nto seek the support of the socialists in the Socialist\r\n\r\nFront of the Federation of Malaya. We know that in\r\n\r\nthose instances, the Minister for Culture tried to play\r\n\r\na communal line when he met members of the socialist\r\n\r\nmovement in the Federation -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of order.

It so happens that we, have two large sections\r\n\r\nof our population - one Chinese and the other Malays.  I\r\n\r\nhave  noticed, Sir, the Government speakers all through\r\n\r\nthis  debate have directly and indirectly implied  that\r\n\r\nwe are opposing merger on a communal basis and all that\r\n\r\nI  seek  to  do, Sir, is to show that this is  not  the\r\n\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is needless to say that the communal line of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Culture failed completely to win over\r\n\r\nthe  support of the Malay socialists in the Federation.\r\n\r\n.We  know  that  our Malay socialist cornrades  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  are  able  to  see  through  the   P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nmischievous and bankrupt propaganda line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we heard the Minister for Culture saying the\r\n\r\nother  day in this Assembly That our demand for Federal\r\n\r\nautomatic  citizenship for all Singapore citizens  will\r\n\r\nstrengthen the P.M.I.P. in the Federation.

Everyone\r\n\r\nknows  that  the Malay rakyat and workers are  becoming\r\n\r\nmore politically awakened nowadays and are beginning to\r\n\r\nsee  through  the  emptiness and futility  of  communal\r\n\r\npropaganda.

Why is the P.A.P., which is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to be a socialist Party, completely  ignoring\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that the Party Ra'ayat in the Federation  is\r\n\r\ngaining  strength from day to day? Why has  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nnot  mentioned  in  this  House  the  fact  that  Inche\r\n\r\nBoestamam,  the  leader  of  the  Party  Ra'ayat,   has\r\n\r\ndeclared  in  the Federal Parliament debate  on  merger\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore should only be taken in in  a  complete\r\n\r\nmerger  with  all  Singapore citizens becoming  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens? Is the Minister for Culture going to tell  us\r\n\r\nthat   Inche  Boestamam,  the  Chairman  of  the  Party\r\n\r\nRa'ayat,  by  saying  this  was,  in  fact,  trying  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  P.M.I.P. which is  supposed  to  be  a\r\n\r\ncommunal Party?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I need not have to tell the people that the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Culture's  arguments  are   not   only\r\n\r\nridiculously  hollow but that they are  becoming  quite\r\n\r\ndangerous.  Sir,  it  is  regrettable  that  in   their\r\n\r\ndesperation, the P.A.P. leaders are playing a dangerous\r\n\r\ncommunal  line. We have noticed that even  some  months\r\n\r\nago  before  the split had taken place the  P.A.P. was\r\n\r\nshouting  dangerous  slogans  like  \"Israel  and   Arab\r\n\r\nworld\",  \"Chinese chauvinism\", etc. Yet  in  the  early\r\n\r\ndays  of  the  P.A.P.,  we  heard  the  P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nconstantly boasting that the Chinese in Singapore  were\r\n\r\nnot chauvinistic but socialistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We clearly remember, Sir, our Prime Minister in 1957\r\n\r\nboasting  that  the election of Inche  Buang  Bin  Omar\r\n\r\nJunid  on the P.A.P. ticket in the Kallang by-election,\r\n\r\nwhich was predominantly a Chinese constituency, was  an\r\n\r\noutstanding demonstration of the non-communal  attitude\r\n\r\nof the Chinese in Singapore. Yet today, Sir, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis   playing  a  double-edged  communal  line.  To  the\r\n\r\nChinese,  the  P.A.P. tries to appeal  to  chauvinistic\r\n\r\nfeelings by harping on autonomy on education.  Even  on\r\n\r\nthe  debate, Sir, on the dispute in the Chinese schools\r\n\r\nthe other day, the Prime Minister deliberately spoke in\r\n\r\nMandarin when we all know he can express himself better\r\n\r\nin English and yet -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Shall  we\r\n\r\ncarry on with the merger debate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the P.A.P. has also been playing on the\r\n\r\nfears  of  the  non-Malays  in  the  civil  service  by\r\n\r\nconstantly  harping  on  the  question  of  the  4:  1\r\n\r\npreferential treatment for Malays in the Federal  civil\r\n\r\nservice.  This, Sir, is a dangerous piece of anti-Malay\r\n\r\npropaganda by  the  P.A.P.  Yet, on the other hand, to the  Malays,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is trying to paint the Barisan Sosialis  as\r\n\r\nbeing  pro-Chinese by saying that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ndoes  not agree with the Federation Government's policy\r\n\r\non  education. But any intelligent person knows that it\r\n\r\nis  because  the  P.A.P. also does not agree  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government's education policy that  it  is\r\n\r\ntrying   to  have  a  different  education  policy   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The only difference is that the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nnot  got  the guts to admit this for fear that it  will\r\n\r\nlose the favour of the Federation Government whose help\r\n\r\nit needs very badly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government, having lost the support of\r\n\r\nthe people, has forgotten all its socialist principles.\r\n\r\nIt  is  playing on very dangerous communal  propaganda,\r\n\r\nstirring  up one community against another. Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  a Chinese. My ancestors came from India but I  was\r\n\r\nborn  in the Federation and so were my parents. I  look\r\n\r\ntowards  Malaya  as the country of  my  birth,  as  the\r\n\r\nobject  of my loyalty. That is my only country.  I  was\r\n\r\nbrought up and educated in this country to which I  owe\r\n\r\nmy  complete  loyalty.  Sir,  I  am  a  socialist  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, I cannot be a communalist. For anyone,  Sir,\r\n\r\nto  accuse a socialist of being communalistic  is  like\r\n\r\nanyone trying to accuse a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian of not believing in Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, socialism and communalism are\r\n\r\nsomething  like  black and white. We cannot  breed  one\r\n\r\nwith the other. If you are a socialist, you cannot  be\r\n\r\ncommunalistic  at  the same time. It therefore  grieves\r\n\r\nme,  Sir, to hear the Member for Geylang alleging  that\r\n\r\nwe in  the Barisan Sosialis are communalistic.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  be grateful if the hon. Member could point  out\r\n\r\nthe  parts  of  the  speech made by my  colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown, which were  communalistic.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  Member for Queenstown became very emotional\r\n\r\nwhen  he came to that part of his speech which appealed\r\n\r\nfor  communal unity and harmony. He also sought in  his\r\n\r\nconclusion to show that there is no antagonism between\r\n\r\nthe  basic  interest  of the various  races  living  in\r\n\r\nMalaya.  He  illustrated this  by  describing  how  the\r\n\r\nworkers  of  the  various  races  in  Singapore  united\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  fight and struggle  for  better  living\r\n\r\nconditions. I believe he quoted the outstanding example\r\n\r\nof  the Public Daily-Rated Employees Unions Federation,\r\n\r\nhow  workers of various races have complete  unity  and\r\n\r\nidentity  of aims and interests. Sir, how can  one  who\r\n\r\nappeals  for communal unity and harmony be  accused  of\r\n\r\nbeing communal?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown, as you know, is a\r\n\r\nmedical man and he has been trained to regard all human\r\n\r\nbeings   as   basically  the  same,  that   under   the\r\n\r\nsuperficial  difference of colour of  the  skin,  human\r\n\r\nbeings  are  basically composed of the same  anatomical\r\n\r\nand  physiological  elements. How can  anyone  possibly\r\n\r\naccuse  the  Member for Queenstown of  all  persons  of\r\n\r\nbeing communalistic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Geylang Serai quoted our reference\r\n\r\nto  apartheid as going to show that we have  adopted  a\r\n\r\ncommunal  attitude.  Sir,  we  have  often  heard   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government saying that one of  the  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  they  did  not want Singapore to  merge  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  is  that  there are  too  many  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  all know the reason why the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment is prepared to accept\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore only if the Borneo territories come in at the\r\n\r\nsame  time.  Sir, it is because the Government  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya hopes that  the  non-Chinese  in\r\n\r\nBorneo  will  thereby help to balance  the  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Is  this  not a communal  approach  to  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  reunification? Does  not  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai agree that this is, in fact, communalism?\r\n\r\nSir, we say that if this is the reason - namely, that the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government  is  afraid  of  the   numerical\r\n\r\nstrength  of  the Chinese in Singapore on  merger,  and\r\n\r\nbecause  of  this it hopes to isolate  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore by giving it separate citizenship - then,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  proposed  constitutional set-up  would  obviously\r\n\r\nsmack heavily of apartheid, and we appeal to the Tunku,\r\n\r\nabove all others, to refrain from imposing such a  set-up  on  the  people of Singapore. Sir, how can  we,  by\r\n\r\nbeing  so,  be accused of being communalistic?  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause we do not want communalism that we oppose  the\r\n\r\nset-up that smacks heavily of communal isolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really cannot understand, Sir, why the Member for\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai  concluded that we are communalistic  in\r\n\r\nour  approach. Sir, with the greatest, respect  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Geylang Serai, I believe he has completely\r\n\r\nmisunderstood   what  my  colleague  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown has said. Sir, the other day the Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai  admitted  that  he  knows  nothing   of\r\n\r\nsocialism. I think, Sir, it is because he knows nothing\r\n\r\nof  socialism  that  he begins to  suspect  us  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis of being communalistic. I  have  said\r\n\r\nthat   socialism   and   communalism   are   completely\r\n\r\nantagonistic  ideologies. If  the  Member  for  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai understands something of socialism, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nthink  he  will  ever  accuse us  socialists  of  being\r\n\r\ncommunalistic.  Sir, socialism is an ideology  that  is\r\n\r\nsweeping across the world, and I am sure that the  next\r\n\r\ngeneration  will be able to fulfil our  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nwhole  human  race  on  earth will  be  living  happily\r\n\r\ntogether  in a socialist world. I would appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nhon.

I  think,  Sir, you will agree  that  this  is\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  most appropriate moment in  our  history,\r\n\r\nbecause we are today faced with the prospect of a  plan\r\n\r\nfor  reunification, a  plan to  unite  the  people  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, which unfortunately, Sir, in my view,  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing to bring about unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that when anyone talks about\r\n\r\ncommunal  problems, they commonly refer to the  Chinese\r\n\r\nand  the Malays. I think this is because the Malays and\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  are numerically the same. Sir,  I  am  an\r\n\r\nIndian  in  origin and I cannot, therefore,  be  biased\r\n\r\ntowards  the Malays or the Chinese. I am, as  it  were,\r\n\r\nneutral  in  the matter. As a socialist.  I  view  this\r\n\r\nwhole  question  of  communal unity  from  a  socialist\r\n\r\nstandpoint  and  not  a  communal  standpoint.   As   a\r\n\r\nsocialist, Sir, I cannot see any antagonism between any\r\n\r\nrace in our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the majority of the Malays, the Chinese, and the\r\n\r\nIndians,   are  poor.  The  majority  of  these   three\r\n\r\ncommunities live from day to day, struggling for  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood. As a trade unionist who all the time  works\r\n\r\nwith them, I have seen workers of all races sharing the\r\n\r\nsame  difficulties, the same problems and the same hope\r\n\r\nfor a better standard of living. Sir, it is the hope of\r\n\r\nthe  majority of all our communities that there  should\r\n\r\nbe  a  change in the social and economic set-up in  our\r\n\r\nsociety  so  that  it  will bring about  better  living\r\n\r\nconditions  to the poor people of all our  communities.\r\n\r\nPoverty -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed:</b> Yes.

May I ask the Member for Thomson not  to  go\r\n\r\ntoo tar away from the amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I do not intend to go too far and I\r\n\r\nwish to assure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  that  it  is  not  my  intention  to  give  a\r\n\r\ndiscourse on socialism. I seek to explain the stand  of\r\n\r\nthe 13 Members of the Barisan Sosialis, and the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  as  such,  on  this  issue  so  that  it   is\r\n\r\nunderstood clearly once and for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point that I wanted to make just now is this.\r\n\r\nJust  as  there  are poor Malays, there are  also  poor\r\n\r\nChinese  and  poor  Indians. Just as  there  are  Malay\r\n\r\npeasants struggling from hand to mouth, there are  poor\r\n\r\nChinese who live in wretched slums in the Chinatown  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the cry for better living conditions for better\r\n\r\neconomic standards, is a cry common to the poor of  all\r\n\r\nraces in our country. I believe we must unite the  poor\r\n\r\nof  all  races to bring about a better form of society.\r\n\r\nIf  the  poor  of  each  of these communities  were  to\r\n\r\nstruggle separately for a better living, they would not\r\n\r\nachieve- as much as they would if they struggled  as  a\r\n\r\nunited body. And I see, Sir, in this common struggle by\r\n\r\nthe majority of all communities for better standards of\r\n\r\nliving,  a real basis for unity between the peoples  of\r\n\r\nall  races.  Sir, I can assure the Member  for  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai  that  when  the Malay peasants struggle  against\r\n\r\nexploitation  by  members of any community,  they  will\r\n\r\nfind in the workers of Singapore, irrespective of their\r\n\r\ncolour,  race,  or creed, friends that  are  second  to\r\n\r\nnone.  Amongst the workers and the peasants, there  can\r\n\r\nbe no basis for communalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for the Southern Islands has tried to\r\n\r\nsay  that  the Chinese in Singapore should be  grateful\r\n\r\nfor what they are having now. Sir, I think this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a very regrettable statement to make. No one should\r\n\r\nconsider himself grateful for what he has. What we  are\r\n\r\nhaving now is merely the result of objective political,\r\n\r\nsocial,  economic,  and  historical  factors.  If   the\r\n\r\nChinese  or  the  Indians,  and  for  that  matter  any\r\n\r\ncommunity,  have political rights in Singapore,  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the historical, social, political and economic\r\n\r\nconditions  necessitate this right. No political  right\r\n\r\nshould  be  considered  a  result  of  charity  of  any\r\n\r\nparticular community, just as the Malays from Indonesia\r\n\r\nhave  the right t participate in the political life  of\r\n\r\nthe country which they have come to adopt as their own.\r\n\r\nPeople who have come from other countries also have the\r\n\r\ntight to political participation in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the peace, harmony and unity that we have today\r\n\r\namong  the  various communities in Malaya is  something\r\n\r\nwhich  all the people should be grateful for, not  just\r\n\r\nthe Chinese, the Indians, or the Malays. Racial harmony\r\n\r\nand unity is something that will bring benefit not only\r\n\r\nto one particular community but to all the communities.\r\n\r\nSir, we the Barisan Sosialis are deeply concerned with\r\n\r\nthe  economic  difficulties of our Malay  brothers  and\r\n\r\nsisters.  This is not because the Malays are inherently\r\n\r\nbackward, as the British wanted us to believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Unlike the P.A.P., Sir,  we  do  not\r\n\r\ngrudge  special  preferential treatment  to  our  Malay\r\n\r\nbrothers  and sisters in Singapore on complete  merger.\r\n\r\nUnlike the P.A.P., Sir, we do not try\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  frighten the people of Singapore by asking for\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger, by harping on the 4:1 ratio,  or\r\n\r\nthe  preferential  treatment  for  Malays  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  We fully agree with the intention  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government in respect of its desire\r\n\r\nto  raise  the  standard of living  of  the  Malay\r\n\r\nrakyat  and the Malay workers of our country,  who\r\n\r\nhave    suffered   enough   at   the   hands    of\r\n\r\nmaladministration under the colonial government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to assure the representatives of the\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O  in this Assembly that if they truly  want\r\n\r\nto  struggle  for better standards of  living  and\r\n\r\nbetter  economic conditions for the  Malays,  they\r\n\r\nwill  find in the socialist movement a friend that\r\n\r\nis  second to none. I wish to point out, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthey  can take that as a categorical assurance  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  all socialists in Malaya.  I  wish  to\r\n\r\npoint out to the Member for Geylang Serai and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for the Southern Islands that it  was  the\r\n\r\nsocialist  movement in Singapore  which  persuaded\r\n\r\nthe Chinese and the Indian and the other non-Malay\r\n\r\ncommunities  to adopt a non-communal line  and  to\r\n\r\naccept   the   Malay  language  as  our   national\r\n\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Geylang Serai, in concluding\r\n\r\nhis  speech, used words like \"long axes\" and \"long\r\n\r\nparangs\".

But to many people who are not as conversant\r\n\r\nin  the  Malay language as the Member for  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai, the words \"parang\" and \"axes\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmean   something  much  more  than   metaphorical.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  Sir,  it  is just unfortunate.  I  quite\r\n\r\nunderstand,  Sir,  that  perhaps  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai was carried away by his emotion. But\r\n\r\nI  wish to assure him, and I am sure he will agree\r\n\r\nwith me in this, that an emotional display will do\r\n\r\nno one any good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to say just this one bit to Members\r\n\r\nof  U.M.N.O. We will never resort to  the  use  of\r\n\r\nviolence  to solve the problems of our people.  We\r\n\r\nshall    only    use   reasoning,   understanding,\r\n\r\ntolerance,  peaceful and constitutional  means  to\r\n\r\nachieve  our objectives. This is because  we  have\r\n\r\nfull confidence in these methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one would have expected from\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Ministers some new  points  in  their\r\n\r\narguments as to why merger with Singapore entering\r\n\r\nas the twelfth State is unacceptable to them. They\r\n\r\nhave  opposed  our  amendment, but  kept  signally\r\n\r\nsilent  as  to  the reasons for their  opposition.\r\n\r\nInstead,  they have replayed the same  old  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npropaganda  tune. Thus, the Minister for  Culture,\r\n\r\nin his rambling address, has confined himself only\r\n\r\nto a rehashing of the usual P.A.P. trash, and this\r\n\r\ntoo,  Sir, far less convincingly than in the past.\r\n\r\nHe  has  tried  to show in a very  roundabout  and\r\n\r\ntedious  way  that  the Barisan  Sosialis  is  not\r\n\r\nsincere  in  its  call for merger as  the  twelfth\r\n\r\nState of the Federation of Malaya, and that we are\r\n\r\nin   fact,  anti-merger.  I  fail  completely   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  how he has arrived at this conclusion.\r\n\r\nEven  the  statements he has quoted  do  not  lend\r\n\r\nsupport  to his contention. I will deal  with  the\r\n\r\nstatements a little later. But I am sure  many  of\r\n\r\nus  here  are  just  as  bewildered  at  the  word\r\n\r\n\"logic\". Probably, Sir, his consultation in occult\r\n\r\nsciences  and astrology must have aided him  m  no\r\n\r\nsmall way to arrive at what he wants us to believe\r\n\r\nin.  Sir,  when desperate politicians  reach  this\r\n\r\nstage,  they are well past the border line between\r\n\r\nsanity and insanity. He has stated, Sir, that  the\r\n\r\nkey to the understanding of the stand taken by the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis lies in the fact that  we  broke\r\n\r\naway  from  the P.A.P., not over the  question  of\r\n\r\nmerger  but because we wanted to push forward  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional anti-colonial struggle; because  we\r\n\r\nwanted to abolish the Internal Security\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil  and wrest from our colonial masters the  right\r\n\r\nof   self-determination.  This,  Sir,  is   a   correct\r\n\r\nobservation.  The  crisis in  the  P.A.P. was  not  over\r\n\r\nmerger, but over the departure of the P.A.P. leadership\r\n\r\nfrom  the  proclaimed socialist aims and objectives  of\r\n\r\nthe  Party.  The P.A.P. leadership was not  willing  to\r\n\r\nstrive for more freedom. In political jargon, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership  moved further and  further  to  the\r\n\r\nRight, and  thus  further and further  away  from  its\r\n\r\nsocialist aims and promises before it came into office.\r\n\r\nThis soon became indistinguishable from the actions  of\r\n\r\na  Right-wing  Government. Permit, Sir,  to  quote  the\r\n\r\nTunku -  a  very  shrewd  man  according  to  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister - to illustrate my point. On the 16th  October\r\n\r\nin the Federal Parliament, on the merger debate, he was\r\n\r\nreported thus in the Straits Times of 17th October:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore, after the elections of 1959 tried to set\r\n\r\nup  what  we might call an extreme Socialist Government\r\n\r\nunder the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they assumed office they tried to put to trial\r\n\r\nSocialist  ideas  and  at the same  time  attempted  to\r\n\r\nsecure    an    understanding   with   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>A few paragraphs later, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They found it difficult to run the island without the\r\n\r\ncooperation of men in commerce and industry,  and  also\r\n\r\nwithout  being on the best of terms with the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsible leaders then realised that they owed a\r\n\r\nduty to the people to serve their interests rather than\r\n\r\nthemselves, so the seeds of difference between the non-Communist and pro-Communist elements in the P.A.P. were\r\n\r\nsown which today have broken into a complete break.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Prime Minister of Singapore felt rather\r\n\r\nconcerned  and approached me with some of his  problems\r\n\r\nand  difficulties.  We  made a  careful  study  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation  and  came to the conclusion  that  the  only\r\n\r\nsalvation for Singapore would be in some form of closer\r\n\r\neconomic   and  constitutional  association  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  in  other  words,  the  Tunku  states  that   the\r\n\r\nleadership of the P.A.P., since assuming office in  May\r\n\r\n1959,  have  forsaken  their socialist  policies.  They\r\n\r\nhave,  in the eyes of the Tunku, who prides himself  on\r\n\r\nbeing  a  Right-wing leader, changed from  \"an  extreme\r\n\r\nSocialist Government\" to \"responsible leaders.\". We all\r\n\r\nknow what the Tunku means when he says\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"responsible   leaders\".  The  hon. the   Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  was  also once referred to as a  responsible\r\n\r\nleader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture quoted some of our Party\r\n\r\nstatements and tried to draw ridiculous inferences from\r\n\r\nthe  stand  our  Party has taken on the  constitutional\r\n\r\nfuture  of  Singapore. He tried to ridicule  our  Party\r\n\r\nstand   by   saying  that  we,  after   advancing   two\r\n\r\nalternatives,    namely,    complete     merger     and\r\n\r\nconfederation,   concluded   that   Singapore    should\r\n\r\ntherefore  have  only  internal  self-government.  Sir,\r\n\r\nallow me to quote in full once again the statements  of\r\n\r\nmy  Party on the constitutional future of Singapore, so\r\n\r\nthat there will be no distortion of our stand. They are\r\n\r\nonly brief quotations, Sir. The Minister for Culture, I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  also  used the same documents to  quote.  Sir\r\n\r\nthis is the Declaration of Meetings of the Conveners of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis. I quote item 5:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our stand on the constitutional future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis stand for a united Malayan State\r\n\r\ncomprising  the territories now known as Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya. Unification of the Federation\r\n\r\nand  Singapore is inevitable and we are glad that there\r\n\r\nis some universal recognition of this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we note that thoughts on a united\r\n\r\nMalayan  State  are being tied up with the  concept  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  i.e. including the Borneo territories.  The\r\n\r\nway  ahead  therefore for a real reunification  of  our\r\n\r\npeople and our country is in one of two directions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(a)   An  immediate,  full  and  complete  merger  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  joining  Federation as a  constituent  State\r\n\r\nlike  Penang  or  Malacca. (b) As an  autonomous  unit\r\n\r\nwithin  a  confederation  with the  Borneo  territories\r\n\r\ncoming in when possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the serious disabilities, that the\r\n\r\nsocialist  movement will have to  put  up  with  by  an\r\n\r\nimmediate  and full merger. Our socialist  comrades  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  have  been struggling  to  remove  the\r\n\r\nvarious  oppressive laws and put an end to the  various\r\n\r\noppressive measures directed against us. We shall  join\r\n\r\nthem and intensify the struggle against these laws  and\r\n\r\nmeasures. In the meantime, we are prepared to accept as\r\n\r\na stage to eventual merger a constitutional arrangement\r\n\r\nfor  a confederation within which Singapore will be  an\r\n\r\nantonomous unit with full autonomy in internal matters,\r\n\r\nincluding  internal security, and conceding  by  treaty\r\n\r\nthe  fields  of  external affairs and  defence  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government. Such an  arrangement  will  not\r\n\r\nonly mean quite substantial advances for the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  hut  it will also bring an end  to  colonial\r\n\r\nrule in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever the direction-'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is  an important paragraph, Sir, from  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture used to draw wrong inferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whatever the direction we choose to take, it is\r\n\r\nimperative  that  the anti-colonial  struggle  must  be\r\n\r\nintensified.  We  must  abolish the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil and wrest the right of self-determination  from\r\n\r\nthe colonial power by 1963.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And,  Sir,  in  the  statement issued  by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   on  the  constitutional  advance   and   the\r\n\r\nreunification  of  the  two  territories  on  the  27th\r\n\r\nOctober, 1961, we said this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We wish to emphasise once again that merger must\r\n\r\nremain  our important objective. If merger is  possible\r\n\r\nforthwith, then we are prepared to convince the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  to  accept this opportunity  to  achieve\r\n\r\nnational unity. In view of the fact that the Tunku  has\r\n\r\nstated  categorically that the merger we ask for cannot\r\n\r\nbe  attained in the immediate future, we must  consider\r\n\r\nalternatives  of  constitutional  advance.  As  a  step\r\n\r\nforward to eventual merger, we will agree to some  form\r\n\r\nof  relationship with the Federation of Malaya based on\r\n\r\nfull   autonomy   for  Singapore,  including   internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is  in  the absence of full and complete  merger.\r\n\r\nFurther:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The constitutional struggle of our people must,\r\n\r\nhowever,  not remain stagnant whilst we wait  for  some\r\n\r\nform  of satisfactory relationship with the Federation.\r\n\r\nWhile   our  people  settle  their  problems  to  unite\r\n\r\nthemselves,  we must not forget, that the  main  factor\r\n\r\nthat  divides  our territories and our peoples  is  the\r\n\r\nexistence of the colonial power. The imperialist policy\r\n\r\nof  divide  and  rule needs no explanation.  The  fight\r\n\r\nagainst  colonialism  in  whatever  form  is  not  only\r\n\r\nantagonistic  to the unity of our peoples,  but  is  an\r\n\r\nessential complement. While we forge ahead the tempo of\r\n\r\nuniting  our peoples, it is important that  we  proceed\r\n\r\nall   out   to   eradicate  colonialism  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  no  satisfactory  relationship  can  be\r\n\r\nestablished  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya  in  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  future, we must strive for full and  genuine\r\n\r\nself-government in 1963.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had to read this throughout because I wanted to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that there is no distortion of our stand  at\r\n\r\nleast  in  the future. Sir, you will have noticed  from\r\n\r\nthese quotations that we believe it is only when either\r\n\r\nmerger  or  confederation is impossible  that  we  will\r\n\r\npersist  in  fighting  for more democratic  rights  and\r\n\r\npolitical freedom for our people, and that the  minimum\r\n\r\ndemand  we  should  put up in the  next  constitutional\r\n\r\ntalks in London in 1963 is complete self-government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the people of Singapore. It is clear from  our\r\n\r\nstatements  that  if  at any time  complete  merger  or\r\n\r\nconfederation  is  possible, then we will  gladly  grab\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to have closer relationship with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  based  on equality and  democracy.  But  we\r\n\r\ncannot agree if the proposition put forward is like the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s phoney merger. We cannot agree with the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  absence  of  any  form  of  satisfactory\r\n\r\nunification  with  the  Federation,  Singapore   should\r\n\r\nremain  politically  stagnant. We have  stated  clearly\r\n\r\nthat  the  struggle  for  more  democratic  rights  and\r\n\r\npolitical freedom for the people of Singapore does  not\r\n\r\nin   any   way  contradict  our  struggle  for  genuine\r\n\r\nunification  between Singapore and the  Federation.  We\r\n\r\nhave  stated that since it was the colonial power which\r\n\r\ndivided  our people and our country, any struggle  that\r\n\r\nwill  reduce  colonial influence in  our  country  will\r\n\r\nlogically  reduce  the  main factor  that  divides  our\r\n\r\npeople  and  our country. That seems to be the  logical\r\n\r\nand  sensible  way  for anyone who  sincerely  wants  a\r\n\r\ngenuine unification of our people. We cannot agree with\r\n\r\nP.A.P. that the continuance of colonialism in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill in any way contribute to the unity of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture speaks of complete self-government in Singapore as though it is something fearful and frightening, as though it is something that would divide Singapore further away from the Federation. Sir, let me suggest to the Minister for Culture that he should read what his master, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  (Mr  Lee  Kuan Yew) said on  internal  self-government  in Singapore in 1955. I have only  a  brief\r\n\r\nquotation  to make from Hansard, Vol. 1,  col.  21,  of\r\n\r\n26th April, 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We believe, Sir, that this country is fit now for\r\n\r\nfull self-government-'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that was in l955 - six years ago. And six years\r\n\r\nago,  our  Prime Minister believed that Singapore  then\r\n\r\nshould have full self-government straightaway. But  now\r\n\r\nsix  years  later,  his  colleague, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture, is telling us that we in Singapore should  not\r\n\r\nhave  full self-government because that will  divide\r\n\r\nSingapore further away from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation. What utter rubbish! Who is doing the double\r\n\r\ntalk?  who is doing the double thinking? Who is  saying\r\n\r\none  thing  at  one time and another thing  at  another\r\n\r\ntime?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister later, on 4th April, 1956, said, in Hansard, Vol. 1, col. 1794 words which are now being contradicted by the Minister for Culture. I shall quote\r\n\r\nthese words, Sir, but I want to say first that when the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister was speaking then, he was speaking on  a\r\n\r\nmotion  moved  by  the then Chief Minister,  Mr  David\r\n\r\nMarshall, to instruct the All-Party Delegation  to  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional talks in London \"to seek  forthwith  for\r\n\r\nSingapore the status of an independent territory within\r\n\r\nthe Commonwealth, and to offer an agreement between the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom Government and the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nwhereby  the Government of the United Kingdom would  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  Singapore exercise control  over  external\r\n\r\ndefence  and  give guidance in foreign relations  other\r\n\r\nthan trade and commerce.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, this motion called on the\r\n\r\ndelegation  to seek an independent State  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nhaving control over all its internal affairs, including\r\n\r\ninternal  security, but with external  defence  in  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the  U.K. Government who shall  also  give\r\n\r\nguidance in foreign relations. Our Prime Minister  said\r\n\r\nthis in col. 1794:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not believe that my Freedom is\r\n\r\na  matter  for argument and that I must justify  why  I\r\n\r\nmust be free.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are admirable words, Sir, but our Prime Minister\r\n\r\ncontinued further. We quote him in the fourth paragraph\r\n\r\nof col. 1794:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Freedom is the birthright of all peoples everywhere\r\n\r\nin  this  world.  Because my forefathers  migrated  for\r\n\r\npurely  selfish economic reasons to what they call  the\r\n\r\nSouth  Seas,  a  whole generation of some  two  million\r\n\r\nChinese  are today left in Malaya with Malaya as  their\r\n\r\nonly home and, necessarily thereby, the sole object  of\r\n\r\ntheir loyalty.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet today, Sir, our Prime Minister wants us to think\r\n\r\nthat  getting  some form of political integration  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  at  all costs, even  at  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nselling away our equal citizenship\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatus,   is  something  justifiable.  He  refuses   to\r\n\r\nconsider   any   form  of  constitutional   advancement\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  out  of  the context of merger.  Our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  begins  all  of  sudden  to  think  that  any\r\n\r\nconstitutional  advance for Singapore towards  reducing\r\n\r\ncolonial influence in Singapore will lead to a  further\r\n\r\ndivision  of  Singapore from the Federation.  Why  this\r\n\r\nsudden  change  of attitude? Or was he advocating  this\r\n\r\nattitude in 1956 merely because he then had the support\r\n\r\nof  the people but now, having lost the support of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  he  has  abandoned it because  he  knows  that\r\n\r\nwithout the Federation Government support, he  will\r\n\r\nnot have a hope of political survival?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, Sir, I must congratulate the Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Finance  on  his  observation  that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis is roughly in a similar position as the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwas  in .1959. Sir, why does the Minister not draw  the\r\n\r\nobvious conclusion that the P.A.P. of 1961 is different\r\n\r\nfrom  the  P.A.P. of 1959? Power corrupts and  absolute\r\n\r\npower corrupts absolutely. We have seen its bad effects\r\n\r\neven though the power is not absolute. We have seen, in\r\n\r\nthe  history of the socialist movement, renegades  like\r\n\r\nthe  MacDonalds  and  the Stracheys  who  fall  by  the\r\n\r\nwayside.  What  the  socialist movement  discards,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. embraces with glee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may God spare us the fate of the angry young men\r\n\r\nof  the  '50s  who, in a short space of 2\ufffd  years  in\r\n\r\noffice,  have  not  only lost their  youth  but  their\r\n\r\nanger. The Tunku has, in addition, shown one point  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  that it was, only after - I repeat,  Sir,  only\r\n\r\nafter -  our  Prime  Minister had run into  difficulties\r\n\r\nwithin his own Party, because of his refusal to rectify\r\n\r\nhis mistakes, that is after Hong Lim, and the demand by\r\n\r\nfive   other  trade  unionists  and  myself,  that   he\r\n\r\nprostrated  himself  before  the  Tunku,  -begged   the\r\n\r\nTunku's  help and cooked up this present deal which  he\r\n\r\nhas the temerity to call merger. Again, at the time  of\r\n\r\nthe  Hong  Lim by-election when I, in common with  five\r\n\r\nother  trade  unionists, made the call  to  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership   to  rectify  its  ways,  to  release   the\r\n\r\npolitical detainees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  strive for the abolition of the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil by 1963, to proceed with the unification of the\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement, and to restore the  citizenship\r\n\r\nrights   deprived  from  the  anti-colonial   fighters.\r\n\r\nMerger,  Sir, was not then an immediate issue. We  were\r\n\r\nnot  anti merger. Merger was not the issue which  broke\r\n\r\nthe back of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all had, and still do, subscribed to the view\r\n\r\nof  independence through merger. But we are  not  slick\r\n\r\nlawyers nor are we confidence tricksters. We accept the\r\n\r\nwords  \"merger\" and \"independence\" at their face value.\r\n\r\nWe  did  fail, Sir, to foresee that men driven  mad  by\r\n\r\npower  and  desperation  could  even  attempt  to  tear\r\n\r\nmeanings out of words. Sir, we are wiser today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, merger was later on slipped in by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  to  cover  up  their  departure  from   the\r\n\r\nsocialist  aims of the P.A.P. and to hide the  betrayal\r\n\r\nof  the trust the people of Singapore had bestowed upon\r\n\r\nthem  in  1959. The P.A.P. leaders sought to depict  by\r\n\r\nthis maneuver those who had demanded for internal self-government  by 1963 as being anti merger. To  us,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe anti-colonial struggle is a complementary phase  in\r\n\r\nthe  struggle for national unity and reunification. The\r\n\r\nseparation of our countries, as the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nhas  said,  is due to colonial machinations. We  cannot\r\n\r\nthus   accept   the  perpetuation  of  colonialism   in\r\n\r\nSingapore   as   conducive  to  the  reunification   of\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are serious students of politics. When we know\r\n\r\nthe  root  cause  of our troubles, we  shall  seek  its\r\n\r\nremoval.  We  do  not go in for symptomatic  treatment.\r\n\r\nThere   is   no   conflict  in   our   call   for   the\r\n\r\nintensification of the anti-colonial struggle  and  our\r\n\r\nstand  on  merger. Our call for the intensification  of\r\n\r\nthe  anti-colonial struggle and the  abolition  of  the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council can in no way imply  that  we\r\n\r\nare   anti   merger.  It  is  utterly   dishonest   and\r\n\r\nmischievous to equate this call for greater freedom  as\r\n\r\nindicating that we are afraid of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture quoted the letter\r\n\r\nwritten  by Mr Lim Ching Siong, the Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis, which was published on  24th\r\n\r\nJune,  1961, in the Straits Times. This did not in  any\r\n\r\nway  show that we are anti merger. But he used this  to\r\n\r\ntry  and  draw  inferences that the  meaning  contained\r\n\r\ntherein  amounted to our being anti merger. Sir,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  a copy of the letter. I am quoting from  the\r\n\r\nspeech  made by the Minister for Culture which has  the\r\n\r\nquotation of the relevant part of the letter he quoted.\r\n\r\nSince  this has been admitted, I suppose it will be  in\r\n\r\norder  for  me  to use this. This is the part  that  he\r\n\r\nquoted:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Merger we have hitherto come to understand was a\r\n\r\nthing of the distant future. However, recent statements\r\n\r\nby  leaders  of  the  Federation hold  out  an  earlier\r\n\r\npromise   of   the   union  of  the  two   territories.\r\n\r\nEncouraging as it is, the question now arises, on  what\r\n\r\nterms will this be effected?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, I will repeat the last sentence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Encouraging as it is, the question now arises, on\r\n\r\nwhat terms will this be effected?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the Government in the Federation and the\r\n\r\nLeft-wing   Government  in  Singapore   apply   certain\r\n\r\nconflicting  policies.  This  is  recognised   in   the\r\n\r\nstatement  by  Dr  Toh,  the  P.A.P.  Chairman,   that\r\n\r\nwhatever  the constitutional position of the future  we\r\n\r\nmust  have control over labour and education.  This  is\r\n\r\nexactly   our   concern.  We  have  stated   that   any\r\n\r\nconstitutional arrangement must not mean a setback  for\r\n\r\nthe people in terms of freedom and democracy.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is the quotation, Sir. How can any sane person say\r\n\r\nthat this quotation shows that the Barisan -Sosialis is\r\n\r\nnot  sincere  in  wanting merger for Singapore  as  the\r\n\r\ntwelfth  State? Let me repeat, Sir: all  that  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChin  Siong  said  was,  \"Encouraging  as  it  is,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  now  arises,  on what  terms  will  this  be\r\n\r\neffected\"   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  the   salient   facts\r\n\r\ntherefore, are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We supported the idea of merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We were ignorant of the details of proposed\r\n\r\nmerger, like all the people of Singapore, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We stated the principles on which any\r\n\r\nconstitutional arrangement should be based.\r\n\r\n<br><br>Thus,  Sir, on 28th August in our policy statement  and\r\n\r\nagain in our Declaration of the Meeting of Convenors of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis - both of which I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nread   out - the  very  same  declaration  which   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture has so ably  read  out  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse, we have maintained the same consistent stand. We\r\n\r\nconfine  ourselves  to  an analysis  of  the  political\r\n\r\nsituation to a statement of principles and to  pointing\r\n\r\nout  in  bold  relief the directions  heading  for  our\r\n\r\nconstitutional advance. We call, as our first priority,\r\n\r\nfor  the  complete merger of Singapore as  the  twelfth\r\n\r\nState  despite  the fact that the details  of  the  so-called  negotiations were not made available to us  and\r\n\r\nin  the face of the Tunku's apparent somersault from an\r\n\r\nattitude of\r\n\r\nriot  wanting merger to his publicly stated desire  for\r\n\r\nmerger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture wanted to know when it\r\n\r\nwas  that we decided to call the P.A.P. deal a sell-out\r\n\r\nand  a phoney merger. Let me state again, Sir: we  were\r\n\r\nnot  against  merger at that time; we are  not  against\r\n\r\nmerger today, and we have never been against merger.  I\r\n\r\nchallenge the P.A.P. Government to quote from  tiny  of\r\n\r\nour statements that we are against merger. Sir, to call\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. deal a sellout and a phoney merger does not\r\n\r\nin  any  way show or imply that we are against  merger.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. deal is not merger, and we have said so.  It\r\n\r\nis  not only a perversion of the meaning of merger, but\r\n\r\nit can also be better described as tipu orang merger - in\r\n\r\nthe words, I believe, of the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when did we call the P.A.P. deal a sell-out? When\r\n\r\ndid  we  describe the P. A. P, citizenship  arrangement\r\n\r\nagreed  to by the P.A.P. Government as making Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens second-class citizens in the new Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya?  Sir, we called the P.A.P. deal a  sell-out  as\r\n\r\nsoon as sufficient details were revealed in this act of\r\n\r\nstriptease politics. Now, Sir, we have exposed the deal\r\n\r\nnaked  for all to see. Who would not be aggrieved  when\r\n\r\nhe realises that the P.A.P. is parading a prostitute as\r\n\r\na virgin?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been described as the \"angry young men.\"\r\n\r\nWe  are  proud  to  be  the angry  young  men  of  this\r\n\r\ngeneration.

For on my\r\n\r\npart, Mr Deputy Speaker, allow me to congratulate  the\r\n\r\nbrains behind the amendment, whether they are inside or\r\n\r\noutside  this Assembly, for their skill and  ingenuity\r\n\r\nin phrasing the amendment. So craftily is the amendment\r\n\r\nworded  that it is made to appear like a neatly wrapped\r\n\r\nparcel  which  has almost succeeded in hoodwinking  the\r\n\r\npeople.  But, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the neatly wrapped\r\n\r\nparcel  are concealed traces of venomous poison  which\r\n\r\nis  very  dangerous  to the people.  Only  those  whose\r\n\r\nvision  is  blurred can be deceived,  and  those  dull-witted  can  be  misled  and  confused.  Where  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we are able to distinguish the sex  of  the\r\n\r\nfishes in the water by their very movement, let  alone\r\n\r\nthe  venomous poison which is easily discernible by its\r\n\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, there is no necessity to take us to the history of far-away Northern Ireland, as was related by the Member for Queenstown in this Assembly\r\n\r\nwhen  he commenced his speech. But, Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nlet  us  for a moment turn to the past and review  and\r\n\r\nassess  our position in order to enable us to plot  the\r\n\r\nway  ahead  and  find out the ways of life  which  are\r\n\r\nsuitable for our people and our State in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to know ourselves than to know others. To\r\n\r\na   true   Malayan   nationalist  fighter,   the   term\r\n\r\n\"Federation    of   Malaya\"   automatically    includes\r\n\r\nSingapore. The two territories are inseparable, be  it\r\n\r\nfrom the historical, geographical or any other point of\r\n\r\nview. Hence, Mr Deputy Speaker, the separation imposed\r\n\r\nupon  the  Federation of Malaya and  Singapore  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  tantamount to the commission of a criminal  act,\r\n\r\nas  stated  earlier  by  my  colleague,  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour, when he introduced this  motion.\r\n\r\nThe  separation of these two territories  afflicts  the\r\n\r\nhearts and minds of all true-hearted Malayan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnationalist freedom fighters. Although this does not in\r\n\r\nany  way  dampen  our spirits or mar our determination,\r\n\r\nthis  man-made  division in fact, further  kindles  the\r\n\r\nfire  of nationalism and intensify our faith to reunite\r\n\r\nthe  two  territories  by confronting  and  eliminating\r\n\r\ncolonialism, in any form, whether from the West or  the\r\n\r\nEast.  And more especially against the colonial stooges\r\n\r\nwhose desire it is for the State to worship the West or\r\n\r\nEast,  and  specifically Moscow. All these factors  are\r\n\r\nobstacles  to hinder and prevent the development  of  a\r\n\r\ntrue  Malayan  nationalist ideal from  becoming  deeply\r\n\r\nrooted  and  embedded in the hearts and  minds  of  the\r\n\r\npeople who love this fair land of ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we should not forget that ever since the British colonialists set their foot on our soil on a mission of colonial exploitation, they\r\n\r\nimmediately partitioned and tore asunder our tiny State\r\n\r\ninto  twelve  midget States and formed three  different\r\n\r\ncolonial  administrations, namely, three countries,  to\r\n\r\nform  the  Straits Settlements, the four  Malay  States\r\n\r\nforming  what was known as the Federated Malay  States,\r\n\r\nand  five  other  States to form the Unfederated  Malay\r\n\r\nStates,  or British Protected States. This is  not  the\r\n\r\nhistory of Northern Ireland, Mr Deputy Speaker.  That,\r\n\r\nin  brief, was how the British colonialists implemented\r\n\r\ntheir  divide  and rule policy on our small  fatherland\r\n\r\nbefore the outbreak of the Second World War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, let us now review briefly the local political situation after the Second World War. During the transitional period of handing over admini\r\n\r\nstration  from  the  Japanese Fascists  to  the  Allied\r\n\r\nPowers,  the  British colonial government despatched  a\r\n\r\nmission to obtain the signatures of the Malay rulers by\r\n\r\nwhich  sovereignty would be transferred to the British,\r\n\r\nand  thereby created the Malayan Union. If  I  were  to\r\n\r\nmake a review of this, Mr Deputy Speaker, it does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that I am bringing up communalism, but merely  to\r\n\r\nexplain  the history of our fatherland for the  benefit\r\n\r\nof our future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was widespread and strong opposition. Feelings\r\n\r\nwere  running  high among the Malay masses.  Eventually\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan Union was sent to the grave in  1948.  The\r\n\r\nopposition movement to the Malayan Union resulted  in\r\n\r\nthe  birth of a Malay political movement known  as  U.M.N.O. under the leadership of Dato Onn Bin Ja'afar  in\r\n\r\n1946 which adopted the slogan, \"Hidup Melayu\", or \"Long\r\n\r\nlive  the  Malays\".  This is, however,  important.  The\r\n\r\nprogressive  Malay  nationalist forces  formed  another\r\n\r\npolitical Party called the Malay Nationalist  Party  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, which subsequently formed a Youth Section and a\r\n\r\nWomen's Section. The slogan adopted was \"Merdeka\".  The\r\n\r\ncontroversy  between these two groups, i.e. the  Party\r\n\r\nwith  the  slogan \"Long live the Malays\" and the  Party\r\n\r\nwith the slogan \"Merdeka\", intensified and became worse\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Federation of Malaya Agreement  was  to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented. The progressive Malay nationalist  forces,\r\n\r\nwith   the   Malayan  Nationalist  Party   of   Malaya\r\n\r\ninitiating the move, organised and united all  factions\r\n\r\nof  Malay  nationalists into one federation called  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   United  Front,  or  PUTRA  abbreviated,   as\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Member for Queenstown, in his  speech.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same  time,  PUTRA called upon  the  non-Malay\r\n\r\nnationalists  to  form  a  separate  federation.   This\r\n\r\nfederation  gave birth to the All-Malayan Council  for\r\n\r\nJoint  Action  or abbreviated A.M.C.J.A.  Subsequently,\r\n\r\nthese  progressive  federations were  amalgamated  into\r\n\r\nPUTRA-A.M.C.J.A.  This federation  later  drafted  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Constitution  as  a  countermand   to   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  Agreement,  which   came   into\r\n\r\noperation in February 1948.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, whilst on the subject of this Putra-A.M.C.J.A., I must confess that I was greatly impressed by the remarks of the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nwhen  he mentioned this Federation. He also quoted  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Constitution. He said that those  people  who\r\n\r\nhave now been branded as pro-Communists did participate\r\n\r\nactively  in the Putra-A.M.C.J.A. which was  considered\r\n\r\nto be a true Malayan nationalist movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, may I ask the Member for Queenstown when he and his friends came to know of Putra A.M.C.J.A. and whether he has ever taken the\r\n\r\ntrouble  to  make  a  thorough study  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nConstitution  which he mentioned? Are all  the  people\r\n\r\nwho   support  the  People's  Constitution  and  Putra-A.M.C.J.A. non-Communist Malayan nationalists? or  are\r\n\r\nthey  pro-Communists or genuine Communists  cloaked  or\r\n\r\ndressed like wolves in sheep's clothing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, much of the time of the Assembly would be taken up if I were to describe in detail the attempts made by the Malayan Communist Party to ride on\r\n\r\nthe  backs of Malayan nationalists in order to  achieve\r\n\r\ntheir own political ideology. This may possibly result\r\n\r\nin  my having to break the record-breaking feat of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown. However, I will  rest  content\r\n\r\nwith the Member for Queenstown holding the record. For\r\n\r\nmy  part,  I  shall  briefly  attempt  to  relate  the\r\n\r\nobjective for which all true Malayan nationalists  have\r\n\r\nfought. At the same time, I shall expose the real  aims\r\n\r\nand  activities of the pro-Communists and the Communist\r\n\r\ncadres   who   have   infiltrated  into   the   Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalist  political movements. Before  doing  so,  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  ask  the  Member for  Queenstown  again  this\r\n\r\nquestion. There is no need for me to challenge  anybody\r\n\r\nelse. Are all the progressive Malayan nationalists  who\r\n\r\nsupport  Putra-A.M.C.J.A. true Malayan nationalists?  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that at that time the Member for Queenstown was\r\n\r\nbusying himself with medical practice.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Member for Queenstown has referred to the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Constitution. But has he studied it carefully\r\n\r\nand  are his followers and he really prepared to  make\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Constitution the basis  of  his  Party's\r\n\r\nmanifesto,  with  all  its implications,  which,  among\r\n\r\nother  things,  states that Singapore is  part  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya? This is important.  It  is  not\r\n\r\ncommunalism. But it is enshrined\r\n\r\nin   the  People's  Constitution  that  Malaya  is  the\r\n\r\nsovereign right of the Malays, that Malayan citizenship\r\n\r\nis \"Melayu\", with undivided devotion and loyalty -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order.

Inche\r\n\r\nYaacob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, what I\r\n\r\nhave  related so far is closely associated.  We  cannot\r\n\r\ncreate something new without first reviewing the  past.\r\n\r\nNationalists  have pioneered the way  for  our  present\r\n\r\nnationalists to fight. So we should go back to the past\r\n\r\nso  that  we may not be led astray. Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe  articles  contained in the  People's  Constitution\r\n\r\nwere  mentioned  by  the Member for Queenstown  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech. Mr Deputy Speaker, if we have not studied  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Constitution thoroughly, do not crow  when  we\r\n\r\ndo not know head or tail of what we are crowing about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to clarify about the sincerity of the Communists and the pro-Communists who were at work with Malayan nationalist forces in the\r\n\r\nstruggle   for  Malayan  independence,  including   the\r\n\r\nindependence of Singapore, when they fought against the\r\n\r\nBritish. Of course, in the struggle against the  common\r\n\r\nenemy,   that  is  British  colonialism,  they   fought\r\n\r\nshoulder  to shoulder with Malayan nationalist  forces.\r\n\r\nBut,  Mr  Deputy Speaker, how far did their  sincerity\r\n\r\ngo?  When  the People's Constitution was  drawn  up  by\r\n\r\nMalayan  nationalists,  the  Malayan  Communist   Party\r\n\r\nreally gave their sympathetic support. But they refused\r\n\r\nto  be  signatories; they refused to  be  tied  to  the\r\n\r\nideals  of the Malayan nationalist struggle. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhen  the Emergency was declared in Malaya, the Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party  withdrew  their  sympathy   for   the\r\n\r\nPeople's Constitution because they failed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  persuade the Malayan nationalist fighters to take\r\n\r\nup  arms  against British colonialism, although  they\r\n\r\ndid  manage to drag a handful of Malayan nationalists\r\n\r\nto join them in the armed insurrection in Malaya. Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, it will be clearly seen,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthat the object of the Communists was to make use  of\r\n\r\nthe Malayan nationalist movement as a vehicle for the\r\n\r\nachievement of their sinister aims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, on this matter, this reminds me of the political terminology used by the Communists, i.e., social chauvinism, a political definition which\r\n\r\nmeans  that  the principle is to support  nationalist\r\n\r\nmovements, especially in times of war. The  Left-wing\r\n\r\nsocialists  or Communists must support  any  form  of\r\n\r\nnational administration in a given State. But, at the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  they  should exploit  the  situation  by\r\n\r\ncreating  economic  and  political  crises   and   to\r\n\r\norganise the people so that they would be in the mood\r\n\r\nfor  social  revolution  in  order  to  establish   a\r\n\r\nCommunist State. In a similar way, they hope  to  use\r\n\r\nthe  nationalist  movement  as  a  steppingstone.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  they  themselves pose as  nationalists.  We\r\n\r\nhave  studied these Communist tactics.  We  know  the\r\n\r\npolitical  A B C taught by the Communists in  Malaya.\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy Speaker, that is the Communist method  of\r\n\r\nstruggle.  They hide behind the facade of nationalist\r\n\r\nmovements and behave like wolves in sheep's clothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now revert to the amendment moved by the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown. He claims to have graduated as\r\n\r\na  Left-wing  socialist only after  reading  tit-bits\r\n\r\nfrom  Marxist  and Leninist pamphlets. There  are  at\r\n\r\nleast  four  underlying motives behind his amendment,\r\n\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To influence the people to reject and wreck\r\n\r\nmerger, because he knows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  if  we demand complete merger based on  Malayan\r\n\r\nhistory   and  within  the  context  of  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nsituation, the Federation Government will reject  the\r\n\r\ndemand.  So their aim is to avert merger. But  it  is\r\n\r\nregrettable  to see that they prefer  to  live  under\r\n\r\nBritish colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Failing to subvert merger completely, they\r\n\r\nwill  attempt to delay as long as they possibly  can\r\n\r\nthe  trend  of  merger  until  such  time  as  their\r\n\r\nstooges in the person of D. R. Seenivasagam  or  Lim Kean  Siew and others have formed the Government  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. I think by that time there will  be\r\n\r\nno happenings such as I have stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Should they succeed in their two plans\r\n\r\nreferred  to above, they can brag to the people  and\r\n\r\nclaim  that  they  are the real  saviours  who  have\r\n\r\nfought  to  safeguard the fundamental  interests  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore. In this way, they dream  of\r\n\r\nbeing  elected by the people in order  to  form  the\r\n\r\ngovernment.  We  know they have  already  designated\r\n\r\nthe would-be Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) With the formation of the Government, the next\r\n\r\nlogical  thing follows, that is, Singapore will  be\r\n\r\nturned   into  a  base  for  the  dissemination   of\r\n\r\nCommunism  in  South-East Asia which, in  course  of\r\n\r\ntime,  will  be  able to control the  whole  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Moment of interruption.
