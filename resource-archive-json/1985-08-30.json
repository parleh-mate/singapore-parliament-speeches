Now that the announcement has been made, I wish to withdraw this Question. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on a point of order. May I ask a clarification from you about the sittings of Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes, proceed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we were informed that Parliament would meet on the 4th of September this year. The Clerk of Parliament, as usual, sent out notices fixing the times for the submission of Questions and Notices to Parliament, and the last day for submission of Questions was the 24th of this month. Suddenly, after 5.00 pm on Friday, the 23rd, I had a notice saying that the sitting of Parliament has been brought forward to today. As a result of that, some seven Questions for Written Answer which I had proposed to send to the Clerk on the morning of the 24th, missed out. May I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, whether there were any compelling reasons for bringing forward the sitting of Parliament? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, that question is out of order.

Your Question which was submitted on 24th August does not fall within the minimum number of days required under Standing Orders. Hence, it cannot be answered at this sitting. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RSAF PLANES LOST/DAMAGED IN FLIGHT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence if he will say how many Republic of Singapore Air Force planes were lost or damaged in flight in the week of the 21st to the 27th of July, 1985. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, two RSAF Skyhawk aircraft were lost \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in flight during this period. The details have been reported in the press. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first incident occurred in the afternoon of 24th July 1985 over the Straits of Malacca. The pilot ejected safely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second incident occurred in the morning of 25th July 1985 near Pulau Sarimbun in the Straits of Johor. The pilot was seen ejecting, but did not survive. His body was recovered three days later, after an intensive air and sea search. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, a third Skyhawk crash has occurred in the Philippines on 26th August 1985. The pilot ejected safely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as can be determined at present, the causes of the three crashes are unrelated. However, as a precaution, after the third accident, the RSAF has temporarily grounded all its Skyhawk aircraft for thorough technical inspections. The Skyhawks will resume flying once these checks are completed and they are certified safe. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have a few supplementary questions for the Minister of State.

Firstly, legal difficulties, because witnesses appearing before a Board of Inquiry are not protected by the same rules of evidence which, apply in the Courts. Secondly, because there could, in some cases, be security objections. It is not parliamentary practice to release Board of Inquiry's findings and reports. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, does the Minister of State not realize that he has not answered my question?

May I ask for an assurance from the Minister of State that if it is found that these crashes were due to mechanical defects in these planes, or they had not been airworthy at the time that they were taken to the air, that finding will be made public? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Such findings shall be made public as it is in the public interest to make public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Minister of State satisfied that the track record of the RSAF is satisfactory as compared to other air forces? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,Sir,l think the RSAF has a reasonable, indeed good track record, Over the last five to ten years, the RSAF has expanded rapidly and dramatically. The numbers of pilots, numbers of aircraft, amount of flying, all have practically doubled. During this period, we have seen also a corresponding improvement in the accident rate of RSAF aircraft. To ask what has happened within one week or one month, and to conclude that something must be wrong for five years or ten years, is a typical example of searching for the irrelevant fact and coming out with the wrong answer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister of State not realize that there were two crashes about a year ago?

Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. \n  <b>Mr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Acting Minister for Labour (a) how many local workers have been retrenched since January 1985 up to the latest convenient date; (b) what are their prospects for re-employment; and (c) what steps are being taken to assist them, particularly the older workers, to secure alternative employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, about 7,000 local workers were retrenched during the first half of this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospects for re-employment of retrenched workers are still fairly good. Most of them can secure employment within a few months after their retrenchment if they are not too choosy. There are still sufficient jobs available although some applicants may have to accept jobs other than those they would like or are most suited for, In July 1985, for instance, the number of new job seekers registered with the Employment Service Department (ESD) was 1,894 while the Department received notification of 2,494 new job vacancies. Technically, we have more than full employment as we still have over 100,000 foreign workers in the labour force. The new hotels are nearing completion and will require workers to man them. Despite the economic slow down, new investments in manufacturing are still being committed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Service Department of the Ministry is assisting those retrenched workers who require help to secure alternative jobs. Efforts are made to persuade employers to employ the older workers. The Department also counsels workers on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> their job expectations. During the first half of this year, ESD offered assistance to 2,991 retrenched workers. Only 733 or 25% responded to the offer. 265 of the 733 subsequently informed ESD that they had found their own employment. 543 jobs were offered to those who responded. It would appear that most retrenched workers are able to find re-employment without assistance from my Ministry. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Vasoo (Bo Wen):</b> Sir, would the Minister be kind enough to enlighten the House as to whether his Ministry has any contingency plans to assist workers in the event of chronic or long-term unemployment of workers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the event of a severe world depression, the Government will look into the possibility of releasing some of the CPF savings to workers to help them tide over their unemployment difficulties. This is, I think, what the Prime Minister mentioned in his National Day Rally Speech - that should there be a prolonged period of unemployment and very severe unemployment, then we will have to look into this use of CPF savings for the workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S.

This is what my Ministry is doing through the Employment Service \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Department. Most of the retrenched workers are able to find their own jobs and do not approach my Ministry for assistance. They generally also have retrenchment benefits to tide them over the interval before they find suitable new jobs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently have a situation of technically more than full employment, with many foreign workers in Singapore. The Government will continue to pursue sound economic policies to ensure as far as possible full employment for our citizens. We must continue to attract new investments to create better jobs. To do this, we must preserve our political stability and ensure that our costs are competitive in the world market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should, however, avoid falling into the welfare trap which many developed countries are trying to get out of. Their unemployment benefits are such that many workers find that they are better off not working. As a result, those who work subsidize those who choose not to work. Our policy should continue to be: good pay for good work and no pay for no work. Only then will our economy remain sound and competitive. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, supplementary question for the Acting Minister. His statement is that there is practically full employment. But would the Acting Minister say whether the Ministry has any figures of workers who have been unemployed now for more than six months? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do carry out surveys periodically to determine how many people are unemployed and, of course, we also do have the registry with the Employment Service Department. But in the case of the Employment Service Department, some of the registrants do not inform us when they have got jobs. So, in fact, we have to countercheck with the CPF Board to find out whether they have got employment. But, on the whole, if we were to look up the papers everyday we will find that the columns in the job advertisement section are still full of job offers and as at the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> moment there are still more jobs listed with the Employment Service Department than suitable applicants. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my question was: has the Ministry any figures? I take it from the Acting Minister's answer that the Ministry does not have any figures. May I tell the Acting Minister that I personally am aware of people who have been out of job for quite long periods of time, for six months or more. This is what I was enquiring from the Acting Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Could you frame your question, please? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> How does his Ministry expect these persons (there may be a few hundreds) to tide over these months of unemployment?

How does the Ministry expect them to provide for themselves and their families during these months of unemployment? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I first correct a misinterpretation there on the part of the Member for Anson. I did not say that my Ministry does not have the information on people who have been unemployed for more than six months. I am sure we have the figures but I am not quite sure whether they are in the form that he wants them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the period between retrenchment and re-employment, our surveys have shown that the majority of workers can find jobs within a few months and many of the retrenched workers also have retrenchment benefits amounting, in many cases, to one month per year of service. So they do have quite substantial amounts. My advice to some of these people would be not to be too choosy; try harder to find a new job because there are plenty of jobs available. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Acting Minister has said about access to the CPF funds if they are unemployed for one or two years, reiterating what the Prime Minister said.

However, it is still necessary to restrict the total amount withdrawn for any one property to 80% of the value of the property at the time of purchase. This 80% limit was imposed to ensure that, should the market price of the property fall, the CPF money will be safeguarded. This is the same prudent limit which financial institutions apply when extending loans for residential properties. Considering that property prices have fallen substantially over the last few years, it does not appear prudent to raise the limit from 80% to 100% of the value of the property. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the question, properties purchased under the ARPS Scheme are excluded from the CPF Home Protection Insurance Scheme (HPIS) for two reasons: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) As there is no ceiling to the value of private residential properties, claims could amount to more than $500,000 for each case, many times larger than that of HDB properties. The inclusion of private properties in the scheme will impose the risk of hefty claims on the funds available. It could also result in the need to raise insurance premiums, to the detriment of the many lower income owners of HDB flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Owners of private residential properties are generally professionals and others in the middle and higher income groups. They can insure their properties with private insurance companies if they wish. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore not in favour of including private property owners in the CPF insurance scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SATURDAY SITTING</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Business Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>11.47 am \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at its rising today, Parliament do stand adjourned to Saturday, 31st August, 1985. - [Mr S.

The Select Committee do not recommend any amendment to the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>11.50 am \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Bill has several clauses, its main purpose is to introduce a new provision to provide for an additional ground for deprivation of citizenship and this is contained in the new Article 135(l)(c). The other provisions in the Bill are essentially redrafts of existing provisions, Article 134 and Article 135 of the Constitution. The new additional ground \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will enable the Government to deprive a person, who is 18 years old or above, of his citizenship, if he has been ordinarily resident abroad for a continuous period of 10 years and has not returned to Singapore during that period on a certificate of status or a travel document issued by the Singapore authorities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me emphasize that this amendment is an empowering provision. There will be no automatic loss of citizenship. The Government will be selective and will not deprive the citizenship of persons who have good reasons to be away. For example, it is not the intention of the Government to act against persons who, by nature of their work or business, find it necessary to travel and remain abroad for long periods. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also mention, Sir, that there is a saving provision in Article 135(l)(c)(ii) to cater for persons who are abroad in the service of the Government or of an international organization of which Singapore is a member. The President is empowered to designate other bodies or organizations for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this amendment necessary? It is necessary because we have had considerable problems with persons outside Singapore who were away for many years and later alleged that they were born in Singapore. Many of them had left Singapore in the early 1950s and 60s when Singapore was going through difficult times. These persons, for all practical purposes, had migrated with no intention of ever returning to Singapore. They have grown up in an alien environment. They have not contributed anything to our economic development. Claiming to have been born in Singapore, they now want to come back, be recognized as citizens with all the rights and privileges and to enjoy the fruits of the labour of those Singaporeans who remain in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite clearly, those who have no skills or no family roots here would have problems adjusting to our society and our way of life. More often than not, many seek to return when they are past the age of 18, knowing full well that we do not want to recruit them into National Service at that age. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an idea of the size of the problem : In 1984, the Registry of Citizenship received 726 claims to Singapore citizenship. However, in the first six months of this year alone, 729 claims were received, exceeding the figure for the entire of last year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add, Sir, that there is also a serious problem in establishing whether a person who claims to have been born here and who has been away for so many years is indeed the person referred to in the birth certificate relied on, particularly if that person never registered for a Singapore identity card or for National Service. Therefore, the Ministry of Home Affairs has had to reject many claims which were dubious and based on suspect documents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matters are further compounded when some of the claimants, whose claims have been rejected, enter Singapore on foreign passports as nationals of foreign countries and subsequently refused to leave. They wilfully overstay, contravening our Immigration laws and we have had to detain them and repatriate them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the problems I have mentioned are real problems. The most effective way of dealing with them is to amend the Constitution in the manner proposed. However, as I have stated, those who have had good reasons to be away, because of the nature of work or business, will be given special consideration and this amendment is not directed at them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I might point out that Articles 134 and 135 of the Constitution have been redrafted and re-enacted and I should explain the reason. This is because the grounds for deprivation and termination of citizenship in the existing Articles overlap. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, both Articles at present refer to the ground of having acquired the citizenship of another country. Another illustration is that both Articles refer to a citizen who has exercised rights of a foreign citizen. There is duplication and this duplication causes confusion. Furthermore, the existing Article 134 does not provide for reference to a Committee of Inquiry. We have therefore redrafted and re-enacted these two Articles, unnecessary duplication is avoided and all cases under \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> both Articles 134 and 135 will be referred to a Committee of Inquiry, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has, in his speech, said that the main purpose of this Bill is to introduce yet another reason or ground for depriving Singapore citizens of their nationality, and he assures this House that it is not the intention of the Government to take away citizenship in every case but that it will be used wisely and judiciously. I am glad for that assurance from the Minister for Home Affairs. But may I tell him, as he must know, that nationality and citizenship is a personal right and it is a very valuable right of the individual. He must know that Oppenheim refers to it as one of the rights of mankind and, in the same book, Oppenheim states his view that it would be a very retrogressive step to deprive anybody of their nationality unless there were very good reasons and, particularly, if that step would render the person being stateless. He regards that as very retrogressive and offending against what he calls the rights of mankind. If that is so, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, and I hope the Minister will accept that position, then I would commend to him that it cannot just be left to the intention of the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for deprivation of citizenship must be spelt out quite clearly and a citizen must be told quite explicitly when and in what circumstances he will stand to lose his citizenship. It is no good telling him, \"Don't you worry. We would not do it although we have got the power.\" That is not going to help the citizen. He must know exactly in what situation he will be deprived of this right of mankind which he shares along with all other people of this world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister would appear to have confused people,who are Singapore citizens and who stand to lose their citizenship as a result of this amendment, with people who, he said, are claiming to be Singapore citizens and whose right to citizenship has not as yet been recognized by the Government of Singapore. I should have thought they were in a different category. If their right to Singapore citizenship has not been \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> recognized, then there is no question of depriving them of their citizenship. It is where a person has the right of Singapore citizenship who stands in danger of being deprived of that citizenship. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has given us some figures of these people who are claiming to be Singapore citizens, and they come up to more than 1,000 persons, or nearly 1,500. May I ask him, what will be the position of these people who have already made these claims to be Singapore citizens? Are they now going to be told, regardless of any good reason they may have, that they are not Singapore citizens because of this amendment? If their claim is that they were and have been Singapore citizens by birth, then they have a legitimate claim to this right of citizenship. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is, of course, aware that under the old Citizenship Ordinance, the Singapore Government recognized the right of jus soli so that mere birth in Singapore gave the person the right of citizenship. That was amended in 1968 by a qualification that one of the parents had to be a Singapore citizen before the child acquired Singapore citizenship. So, what about these persons who had citizenship under the old Citizenship Ordinance. If they were citizens, then they remain citizens. I can understand them losing their citizenship if they have taken on a foreign nationality or citizenship of a foreign country. What about those who have not? I know myself cases of persons who have been clamouring to come back, who have not taken up citizenship but who have been kept out by the Immigration Department refusing to issue them with travel documents to return to Singapore. Are they now going to be told, \"There, my man, look, you haven't come back for ten years. So you are not going to get your citizenship.\"? That would be dishonest on the part of this Government because these people have been clamouring to come back. So I hope there will be no blanket application of this amendment, even in those cases where they have not taken up Singapore passports but are now claiming to be Singapore citizens and to be recognized as such. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am more concerned, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with persons who are Singapore citizens and who have gone abroad on Singapore passports. Now, the proposed amendment under Article 135, clause (1)(c), as the Minister has pointed out, gives this Government the power to take away their citizenship if they have been out of Singapore for ten years and have not, during that period, entered Singapore on a travel document issued by the Singapore Government. I have a clarification, first of all, to ask of the Minister. Would this travel document include a travel document issued to refugees under the Convention of the 28th July, 1951? 1 should have thought not. But may I ask for an assurance from the Minister that Singapore citizens who travel under these documents will not be caught by this amendment? Because, as the Minister should be aware, travel documents issued under this Convention are not passports and they are not nationals of the countries which issue these travel documents. I would like that assurance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the category of persons who are born in Singapore, who are Singapore citizens, and who travel abroad on Singapore passports and who have no intention at all of giving up their Singapore citizenship, what is the reason, may I ask, for taking away their citizenship if they for good reasons do not return to Singapore for ten years? I think it is not good enough merely to leave it to the good intentions of the Government. The Minister should make clear what the purposes are. How are they considered disloyal to Singapore if they are away from Singapore for more than ten years? Is that an act of disloyalty? Is the Government not aware that they are perhaps contributing to the economy of Singapore - if they earn abroad and are able to remit home monies. They are an asset to Singapore - and to deprive them of their citizenship would be most illogical and retrogressive, particularly if they are rendered stateless if, by that Act, they are no longer eligible to become nationals or to acquire citizenship of any other country. And, of course, if they were born in Singapore and were Singapore citizens by birth and travelled out of Singapore on Singapore passport, they would be stateless if by this amendment their citizenship is taken away. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Articles 134 and 135 are not the only Articles in the Constitution which enable the Government to take away citizenship. There is Article 129 of the Constitution. If I may beg your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in referring to some of these provisions in Article 129. Article 129 applies in the first place only to persons who became citizens by registration or by naturalization. It does not apply to persons who are citizens of Singapore by birth. Under that Article, the Government may deprive persons who are citizens by registration or naturalization for a number of reasons. One of them is if they had made a speech which would appear to be disloyal towards Singapore - I should have said \"disloyal towards the Singapore Government\" rather than Singapore. But the important thing is this. If one looks at Article 129, clause (7), one finds this safeguard for persons who have become citizens of Singapore by registration or by naturalization, and it is a very important safeguard, Article 129, clause (7) reads as follows, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No person shall be deprived of his citizenship under this Article or under Article 130 unless the Government is satisfied that it is not conducive to the public good that that person should continue to be a citizen of Singapore; and no person shall be deprived of his citizenship under paragraph (b) of clause 2 [that is Article 1291 or under paragraph (a) or (b)(i) of clause (3) [again Article 129] or under clause (4) or (5) or under Article 130 if the Government is satisfied that as a result of the deprivation he would not be a citizen of any country., \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since reference has been made to Article 130, 1 should perhaps read that. Article 130 applies to the children of citizens who have been deprived of their citizenship under Article 129. That is all that Article 130 does. So in the case of persons who are naturalized or registered, there is a clog on the power of the Government to deprive them of their citizenship. And the clog is that the Government must be satisfied that it is not conducive to the public good that the person should continue to be a citizen of Singapore. And, secondly, he should not be deprived of his citizenship if the result is to render him stateless, \"not a citizen of any country\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Articles 134 and 135 in this Bill are not restricted to persons who become citizens of Singapore by naturalization or by registration. It applies to everybody. The proposed Article 134 reads, \"The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Government may by order deprive a citizen of Singapore. . .\". And that includes persons who are citizens by birth or by descent, besides including those by registration or by naturalization. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, Article 135 says, \"The Government may by order deprive a citizen of Singapore of his citizenship\". So it catches everybody, not just those two groups. But you do not find any clog on this power of the Government in Articles 134 and 135. So it would appear that whereas the Government may not deprive a citizen, who is registered as a citizen or who became a citizen by naturalization, of a citizenship if he is rendered stateless, the Government may deprive a citizen by birth or descent of his citizenship even if it renders him stateless, and even if the deprivation of his citizenship is not conducive to the public good. May I ask why this favoured treatment for persons who acquire citizenship by registration or naturalization against persons who are born in Singapore and who have a greater claim to Singapore citizenship? It is their inherent right. Perhaps the Minister would like to look at that. As far as I can see, there is no clog on the Government's power under Articles 134 and 135. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I sit down, the Minister referred to this Committee which is set up under the Constitution. May I ask the Minister whether he has any figures as to how many persons were deprived of citizenship in the early part of 1977 and were persuaded to give up their right of appeal to this Committee? I know a number of people were deprived of their citizenship and, in a number of their cases, they were not referred to a Committee of Inquiry, and my information is that they were persuaded to give up their right of appeal to this Committee. May I ask the Minister whether he will take steps to see that no one will be persuaded by anybody to give up his right of appeal to the Committee? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Bernard Chen (Clementi):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to give my support to the proposed amendment to the Constitution. All of us Singaporeans are very proud of our citizenship. Many of us were migrants and in the last hundred years we came here, we slogged it out, our forefathers, ourselves. There is therefore no \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> question that citizenship is a very precious thing. But if there are among us people who do not treat this citizenship as precious as others and have chosen to stay away for long periods of time, then we have got to question whether they should continue to enjoy the privileges extended to them as citizens, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As citizens, we enjoy the right to vote, to decide on the future of our country. At the same time, we also have the obligation to work for the survival and the prosperity of the nation and there are many ways in which we are doing it, whether it be economic development, social progress and, most important, security through doing national service ourselves or sending our children to do national service to prepare ourselves for any eventuality. For some of us, it has been painful. We see the demise of loved ones. Is it therefore logical that we, as citizens, perform all these obligations and pass on these benefits to people who have renounced Singapore in their own interest but who, having found that the pasture is not as green on the other side of the fence, decide to come back and exercise their rights? We heard of talks about preservation of rights but never for one moment have we heard talk about obligations, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Member of the Opposition appears to be a champion of all non-citizens or people who have renounced their total interest in Singapore. He has been known to take up causes for illegal immigrants, work permit holders who have overstayed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, on a point of order. May I ask the Member where, in the speech that I have just made, have I taken up the cause of people who have renounced their citizenship? The Member does not appear to know what he is talking about. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order, Mr Jeyaretnam. If you wish to clarify something, you rise on a point of clarification. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Then I rise on a point of clarification, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Carry on, Mr Chen. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> As I said, if we give free licence to all those people who have given up Singapore for good to come back later on when the times are better, then we are doing a grave injustice to ourselves, to our citizens, who have made all the sacrifices in the past and would do so in the future. I think that is one point that all of us should realize. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point relates to whether innocent cases will be unfairly treated. As the Minister stated in his speech, there will be many provisions and safeguards. The amendments state clearly that if a citizen has stayed away for more than 10 years and cannot give good reasons - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Where does it say that? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> In the Minister's speech. And this will be a good ground. There are many cases where with modern communications, there is no reason why a person cannot come back within the 10 years. What excuse has he got to stay away without even setting foot in Singapore except for the reason that he has given up for good. And since he has done so, let us complete the picture for him. I think we need less of people who only make use of Singapore when it is convenient for them, when it is safe for them, when it is good for them. As we build up our nation, we need people who are committed to stay here for better, for worse, for life or death. And I think the Constitution of a country is not only to extend privileges to the citizens but also to safeguard the interest of these citizens who abide by it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support fully the Minister's proposed amendment with just one small qualification, ie, in the exercise of these safeguards and provisions, that the officials be given clear instructions to ensure that genuine cases are not mistreated. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. The Constitution is sacred in that it protects the rights of the individual while providing the framework for an orderly society through an honest and efficient government. The fundamental rights of a citizen of the Republic of Singapore are clearly laid down in Articles 9 and 13 of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. Article 9 (1) reads: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 13 (1) reads: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No citizen of Singapore shall be banished or excluded from Singapore.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would seem at first glance that the proposed amendments are too harsh. It seems to place a serious obstacle on the full operation of Articles 9 and 13. However, if these rights are viewed within the total context of the nation, they may not appear to be undesirable because personal liberty must have limits, without which parliamentary democracy will eventually lead to anarchy in the name of individual liberty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the Singapore scenario which fabric is the law, necessarily individual liberty must be subservient to the laws of Singapore. The laws of Singapore in turn should be subsumed under the supremacy of national well-being, and it is that that must set the limit to the law. Therefore, individual liberty must resolve within the expanding tenses of law and national interest. Law makers, ie, Parliament with its elected representatives, must never lose sight of national interest, ie, interest of the people who give them the power of legislation in the first place. The moment this is ignored, authoritarianism creeps in which will eventually spell the death of democracy. Laws change as the boundary and constitution of national interest change. Law and national interest interact constantly and incessantly in order to provide a platform for individual liberty without which individual liberty is meaningless. With the law and national interest as platform, individual liberty finds its expression in conformity with the laws of the land which is individual responsibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as law makers legislate with the interest of the individual as the primary intent, individual liberty will be safeguarded. However, should law makers legislate with the intent towards selfish individualism and self-preservation, individual liberty will be eroded as to its content and meaning. Viewing the proposed amendments objectively, having regard to the wordings used in it, it is my opinion \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that the interest of the people and therefore the nation is upheld in the proposed amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to Article 135(l)(c) forces the person who has been away for a long period to re-examine his responsibility to his nation. Ours, as my learned colleague has mentioned, is an immigrant society. In the last 20 years of independence, the Government has tried to imbue a sense of belonging, commitment and loyalty to our nation. Citizenship carries with it privileges but also responsibilities. With our limited resources, we cannot afford to be benevolent with those who turn to us only in good times. We want citizens who are stayers, who will be with us in good times and in not-so-good times. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would a person want to be a citizen of Singapore? The main reason must be that he wants to live in Singapore. And why does he want to live in Singapore? Because he must have judged that Singapore will provide him with a good and secure life for himself, his family and a bright future for his children. These are the benefits. The responsibility is to contribute to our peace, progress and prosperity. And in the case of the male Singapore citizen, the man, this means national service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will plug the loophole in the law so that those who have been staying overseas through childhood, through adulthood, to escape national service will now have to rethink on their position. Because the loyal Singaporean who stays in Singapore, serves his 2,5 years' national service and approximately one month every year of incamp training, must be convinced also that there is fair play in his sacrifice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are eligible for national service and yet stay overseas for long periods will be penalized by Article 135(l)(c). But there will be others, of course, who stay away with genuine reasons. They will also be affected by this amendment. It is thus reassuring to hear our Minister's statement that it is not the intention of the Government to act against persons who by nature of their work or business find it necessary to travel and remain abroad for long periods. This is important because this amendment will apply retroactively. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to consider the practicability of informing citizens, when they go to our overseas missions to renew their passports, of the new laws that will apply to them. In this way, the citizens will be safeguarded from losing their citizenship through ignorance. When they come for their passport renewal, if they are informed of these new amendments, they can then decide as to whether they would like to treasure their Singapore citizenship and come home. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will not result in automatic loss of citizenship. As the Minister has mentioned, it is an enabling Act giving discretion to the Minister. As I have mentioned, my concern is for cases affected by the retroactive application of the law. It is my sincere hope that the Minister will consider each case sympathetically as I can foresee that there may be some who are staying overseas for personal reasons, reasons other than for work or business. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline K. Wong (Changkat):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the amendment Bill. But I would like to ask the Minister one question. Why is the woman singled out for mention in Article 134(b) and not the man? Why should the woman be considered a separate case where she has acquired citizenship by registration and may lose it if she acquires another kind of citizenship? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the chance to speak. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Hon. Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law has made out a case in moving the amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, particularly Articles 134 and 135. As I see in the explanatory statement, these are very explicit, Therefore, I would like to refer my remarks to what was said by the Member for Anson. The first point that he made was on nationality and citizenship which, he said, is a very personal right. I would have thought that nationality and citizenship are two different things. In the case of nationality, a nation can be made of one kind of people. The same goes with \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> citizenship. But when he mentioned deprivation as a retrogressive step, I do not think I can accept that kind of argument. How could deprivation be a retrogressive step? In this particular case, today [Interruption]. I am not a student of law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not a lawyer, I do not represent any case, except to mention this. Probably for the amusement of this House, he mentioned \"1977\", a time when he was not in this House. He said he knew of a number of cases of people who were persuaded to give up the right of appeal. As is his usual way of trying to distort and confuse the situation, he has chosen to bring in issues on refugees not having the intention of giving up citizenship: what good reasons to deprive them? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate, in today's debate, that Articles 134 and 135 have been redrafted and re-enacted, as the Hon. Minister has pointed out, to avoid duplication. And here, I must congratulate the Government for its assurance that this amendment, being an empowering one, that in its implementation the Government would be very selective with regard to the deprivation of citizenship. So I agree with what my good friend, the Member for Clementi, has said, that the Member for Anson has been the champion of non-citizens or of taking up questions of citizenship. I tried to dig up Hansard, and I found the questions very similar in March 1982,1983 and 1984, Sir. So I am not at all surprised. But I thought I ought to point out that when the voters of Anson voted him in, their interests should be looked after, and not the interests of non-citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stake for all those who are in Singapore today as citizens. As has been rightly pointed out by the Second Minister for Law, why do these people - 726 in 1984 and 729 for the first six months of this year - file claims of citizenship now? I am surprised why his Ministry is considering their claims. It must have cost taxpayers some money. If we go through the reasons thereto in the clauses, these claims could be rejected outright. So I would like to seek enlightenment from the Hon. Minister: who are these cases, and why were these people who claim to have been born in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singapore choose to come back now? Of course, I have taken note of what he has explained in moving the Second Reading of the Bill. But I thought I ought to make a few points along the way because, when I heard the Member for Anson trying to make out a case, I said, \"Here we go again, as he has always been seen to be.\" Are we for or against Singapore? On that note, Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification. Would the last Member, as I asked his colleague on the other side there, point out in which part of my speech I spoke about non-citizens? And if he cannot, will he withdraw his baseless allegation? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we were to play back - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> He sits in the Chair, I can call him \"Mr Speaker,\" Sir, just out of respect. He mentioned refugees and the convention. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> They are Singapore citizens I am talking about. You do not understand. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> That is what he says, to be Singapore citizens, Mr Speaker, Sir. And I think that is the point I am trying to make. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You do not understand. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill which has been put forward by the Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law. We have heard the moving arguments by both the Members for Clementi and Fengshan and I do not wish to enlarge them any further. But it always strikes me as very strange, Sir, that while we are here on a barren piece of rock without any form of natural resources, there are many people, including a number in my own Constituency, who wish to be Singapore citizens. After all, I think, as Singapore citizens we do not lead an easy life. There is no oil under our feet; there is no gold in our backyard, and even our welfare assistance payments are very minimal. They cannot keep body and soul together. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Hear! hear! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> That is not the intention. The intention is for us to work hard, to achieve our prosperity and our success, and to continue to work hard to maintain that level of success. So for those people who have chosen to stay away from our shores for a long time and who only want to come back when the going is rough in other places; or where life is better here that they wish to come back to enjoy the fruits of other people's labour, it is right that their citizenship be deprived. We should care for the people who remain here with us through thick and thin, good or bad, people who will eventually be the sons of the soil that will make Singapore a successful place. In this regard, I think what is considered the fundamental concept of birth right, as a fundamental right to citizenship, is not something that is universal.Only in countries,like the United States, where they are rich, full of resources, bountiful and perhaps because of this, more charitable to others than small barren countries like us, do they enshrine the right of birth as a fundamental right to citizenship. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Singapore, I think we should look at birth as an entry point. It gives you the right to be a citizen at the entry point, but thereafter I think everyone of us must continue to work to keep that right and to earn that right. The right is not something that, once you have it, you can have it for the rest of your life regardless of what you do. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Sir,l support the Amendment Bill, but I hope that the Minister will give an assurance that he will consider the case of those persons who are currently abroad and who may be affected by the enactment of this Amendment Bill - that these people who may be caught by the change of events be given a period in which they can rectify their status so as not to be caught in a position whereby their citizenship can be deprived. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the amendment to the Bill. \n  <br>12.43 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I join in the debate. I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship is not just a right, it is more than that. Especially for those who are naturalized citizens, citizenship is an expression of loyalty, of commitment, of dedication to the Constitution of Singapore and to the Republic of Singapore. When a person says that he is a Singaporean, what does he really mean? It is not just the legal status of being a citizen. It is also the emotional attachment to the country, to the Republic. When we say that Singapore is our homeland, there is an emotional attachment to think Singaporean. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson confines himself to the question of rights, but here we are talking about provisions for deprivation of citizens who have for all practical purposes given up their rights. They have given up their rights because they have exercised the rights of nationals abroad, because they have stayed away for more than 10 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are various reasons why people want to leave Singapore. So be it. But for these people Singapore cannot be a convenient place for them to return when they face adversities abroad. I know of a particular family from Singapore who migrated to Canada. When they faced adversity, they went to Australia, and just recently they have expressed a desire to come back to Singapore. Certainly, although they were born in Singapore, we cannot ever consider returning citizenship to such exSingaporeans. Our only resource is manpower and aside from other qualities of the manpower we have, in my view what is most important is loyalty, commitment and total dedication. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, under the provision, citizens who have stayed abroad for more than 10 years may be deprived of their citizenship. Here,l would like to put to the Minister that Singaporeans abroad must be given every opportunity to be warned of this provision, especially in terms of opportunities to renew their citizenship or travel documents. There are many Singaporeans who are staying abroad. They may have difficulties trying to renew their passports or whatever \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> travel documents they have. So I hope that the Minister will ensure that every means is made available for these Singaporeans to maintain their citizenship status. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Members who have spoken in support of the Bill; in particular, they have saved me considerable time in replying to the points made by the Member for Anson because the Members who have spoken have put the matter in correct perspective. In other words, when we talk of constitutional rights and of citizenship rights, let us also talk of duties and responsibilities, and that is the context in which we should view this measure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take up one or two specific points mentioned by various Members. The Member for Changkat asked why is there a discrimination against women in Article 134(l)(b). First, let me say that this is not a new amendment. This is a re-enactment of an existing provision in the Constitution which we have had for a long time. Secondly, she has misunderstood the provision. If she looks at Article 134(1) (b), it is not deprivation of citizenship of a woman who marries a non-citizen. It is deprivation of citizenship of a woman who, in the first place, becomes a Singapore citizen by having married a Singaporean and thereafter marries a non-citizen, say, after divorce. So the original link which was the basis for granting a citizenship through marriage is non-existent, and if she marries a foreign citizen then only Article 134(l)(b) comes into play. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Fengshan has brought up a useful suggestion and my Ministry will take it up with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as to whether overseas missions and consulates could implement the idea which he advocated of advising those who come to renew their passports from time to time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the suggestions made by the other Members expressing concern on the implementation of this amendment, I have already, in my Second Reading speech, given the assurance that there will be no automatic or blanket implementation of this empowering provision and, secondly, we will be very careful in implementing the provision so as to distinguish cases \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> where there are genuine and good reasons for the person's absence abroad. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we come to the Member for Anson's points, as I have said, many of his criticisms have been answered by preceding speakers. I think we must come back to see the parameters of this provision. What are they? Does the amendment give us arbitrary powers to deprive any citizen on any grounds? Let us recall the principal feature of Article 135(i)(c). It is concerned with citizens who have been continuously abroad, ordinarily resident, for 10 years or more. That is the first ingredient. The second ingredient is that during this period of 10 years he has not even once come back to Singapore on a travel document issued by the Singapore authorities or on a certificate of status. That is the parameter of Article 135(l)(c). So, in reply to the question posed by the Member for Anson as to why we are doing this, the correct question has been posed by the Member for Clementi, ie, let us ask: how do these persons who stayed away for 10 years or more and never returned to Singapore once on a Singapore passport or travel document justify their continued citizenship to be recognized? That is the question. I have also spelt out the problems that we have which must be tackled in this amendment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised this matter on the level of international law. He has quoted Oppenheim as authority for the proposition that what we are seeking to do is retrogressive and he has implied that this is somehow inconsistent with international law. I think if he wants to quote Oppenheim or any other known works of international law, he should also tell this House that the cardinal principle in public international law is, as far as nationality and citizenship are concerned, that questions of nationality and citizenship under international law are within the sovereign right of each country to decide. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> We know that. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Why did the Member for Anson not say so? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What is the point? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> There is no international law which proscribes the right of countries and carry out the measure such as that which we are seeking to do. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson also asks whether I could clarify if the phrase \"travel document or certificate of status issued by the competent authority of Singapore\" does or does not include a travel document issued under the United Nations Convention on Refugees. Of course, it does not. The plain meaning of the words must be clear even to a non-lawyer - a certificate of status or travel document issued by the competent authorities in Singapore. It does not include any other travel document than that mentioned in this provision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also seeks an assurance from me that persons who may possess this travel document issued under the Refugees Convention will not be caught under this provision. I cannot give that assurance because, on the plain reading of this provision, any person who has been away from Singapore for 10 years or more and who fulfils the requirements will come within the ambit of the provision. So I cannot give that assurance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson talks about statelessness. He talks about Articles 134 and 145 being applicable to all categories of citizens. I should like to point out that Articles 134 and 135, even as they stand under the present Constitution, make no distinction between citizens by birth and other categories. They apply to all categories. In that sense, we have not differed in the approach. Secondly, the present Articles 134 and 135 are not subject to the condition of the persons not being rendered stateless although in the implementation of this provision my Ministry will take into account the question of statelessness as one of the factors in arriving at a decision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, he concluded by making a very vague allegation that sometime in 1977, many persons were deprived of their citizenship and, to use his words, they were persuaded to give up the right of appeal to a Committee of Inquiry, The Member, if he really wants to be responsible, ought to give us facts and figures \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and I give him the assurance that I will investigate these cases. But I think it is wrong for him to come here and say that many persons were deprived of their citizenship without reference to a Committee of Inquiry, because the right to a Committee of Inquiry where prescribed under the Constitution is a right available to the citizen and I do not see how anybody can be persuaded. But if he has substance for any allegation that any wrongdoing has taken place, he should come to this House and substantiate his allegation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is all I have to respond. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Minister first of all, gives an assurance that the travel document issued under this Convention of 28th July 1951 will not be treated as a travel document for the purposes of Article 135(l)(c). I am grateful to him for that assurance. He goes on to say, \"But he asks for an assurance that persons who have held this will not be deprived of citizenship. I cannot give him an assurance.\" I would ask him to be quite explicit and give an assurance that anyone who has held this will not for that reason - I am not talking about Article 135(l)(c) but I am talking about Article 135(l)(b) - will not be deprived of their citizenship solely on the ground that they have travelled under the travel document issued under this Convention of 1951. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I am afraid he has really not answered my point about the clog on the Government's power. I referred him to Article 129 where you have a specific clog on the power of the Government in clause (7) of this Article. You have no such clog in Articles 134 and 135. The Minister says, \"Of course, we will pay regard to this.\" But I am saying that is not good enough. Why do you have an entrenched right in the Constitution for persons who become citizens by registration or by naturalization but not for people who are born citizens? Why do they not have this entrenched right? That is my point. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in answering his question concerning \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Article 135(l)(c), I clarified that a travel document issued under the Convention of Refugees is not a travel document or certificate of status mentioned in Article 135(l)(c). If he now wants to talk about Article 135(l)(b), there again the wording is clear: whoever applies to the authorities of a place outside Singapore for the issue or renewal of a passport, it would include any place, any authority, outside Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of statelessness, I have already elaborated and explained the position. In other words, we are following the approach in Articles 134 and 135. The approach in Articles 134 and 135 is the approach which is adopted in this amendment, and there is nothing new. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry, a clarification again. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, could you resume your seat, please?

We thought it better to take our time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several names were proposed. The Cabinet took quiet soundings. Gradually a consensus emerged that Wee Kim Wee, proposed by my colleague, S. Rajaratnam, was the most suitable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rajaratnam knows him very well. They were both newspapermen and had known each other for over 30 years. And it was Rajaratnam who persuaded him in 1973 to give up his job as Editorial Manager in the Straits Times to become our High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur. There, for seven years until 1980, he helped to establish our relations on a basis different from that which prevailed before Separation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had met Wee Kim Wee in the 1950s in his capacity as a reporter, and later as an editor. He was a competent, objective and reliable journalist. He was also a man committed to Singapore. It was early in my political life. During the tumultuous 1950s and 1960s, I observed that he watched, with barely concealed alarm, the agitation, the protests, the strikes, the demonstrations, and the violence that sporadically broke out. They were part of the revolution in the streets of Singapore. He was a Straits-born Chinese, English-educated, and thoroughly law-abiding. He watched this deliberate build-up of hate and violence with distaste and dismay. He must have thought the country was going down the drain. And he often looked at me with incomprehension, wondering what I was doing, siding with or representing these wild men, and adding to the mayhem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not realize how shrewd he was until he became our High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur. When I read his perceptive \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> despatches from Kuala Lumpur, I recognized that he understood the difficult, delicate, and complex nature of our relationships. A measure of his engaging personality was that he had free access to all the important leaders in Kuala Lumpur. The Prime Minister, Federal Ministers and officials, all spoke freely and frankly to him. His despatches analyzing the situation always got to the heart of the matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I asked him a few weeks ago to consider this appointment, he reminded me that he was not even a graduate, I said that was irrelevant. We were not looking for a scholar. What Singapore needs in a President is a man of integrity and dignity. He is without affectations. His easy manner and his understanding of people will make him a good Head of State. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he agreed to be considered as President, l asked him to give me a resume of his career. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as Prime Minister, I read the curriculum vitae of the people I am about to meet. They are either mostly VVIPs or important men whom I have to consider for high positions. So I have some experience in interpreting the curriculum vitae of people with great accomplishments. Some are brief and terse, others are detailed, listing out their degrees, their titles, their high offices, and their decorations. Wee Kim Wee's resume was straightforward and simple. It was not meant to impress anyone. In summarizing his career, I think I can do no better than to abstract the gist from his resume because this is how he sees himself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I was born (at the Free Middleton Hospital) in Singapore on 4th November 1915. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was the fourth and youngest in the family -two brothers and one half-brother. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father was Wee Choong Lay. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother was Chua Hay Luan alias Tak Poh. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father worked as a clerk on a ship in charge of cargoes (then referred to as a \"chin choo\"). The ship plied between Singapore and Java. He was blind at a fairly early age (before 45) after an unsuccessful operation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this tragedy the family was forced through circumstances to move from Zion Road to 41/2 milestone Holland Road into a house offered by a wealthy owner for a token rental of $3 a month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house had no electricity or piped water. The family resorted to poultry-rearing and also depended on some fruit trees in the sprawling compound for its survival. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At eight years old (in 1923) I was admitted to Pearl's Hill School. From there I went on to Outram School and thence to Raffles Institution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1929 I passed my Standard VII and was due to be promoted to a \"Junior\" class. [I think \"junior\" means Junior Cambridge which is perhaps something around 'O' levels or maybe \"N\" levels.] My mother prevailed upon me to seek employment as the family was still eking a hand-to-mouth living at the Singapore Harbour Board (SHB) quarters at Kampong Bahru. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My uncle, Tan Kok Tiong, was then Chief Clerk of the Straits Times. On his recommendation I got a job in the Circulation Department, Five years later I was transferred to the Advertising Department. Three or four years later I got my first \"break\" as a reporter, covering sports after my regular office hours. I reported on soccer at the three stadiums (Anson Road, Farrer Park and Geylang) and all the badminton, table-tennis and basketball matches at the three amusement parks (Happy World, New World and Great World), \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early 1936 at the age of 21, 1 was married to Koh Sok Hiong. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seven children - a son and six daughters. Three are in Singapore, one in Kuala Lumpur and three in Melbourne, Australia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife, Koh Sok Hiong (68) was born in Singapore. She did her primary and secondary education in Chinese schools - Hua Chiao at Pasir Panjang and Nanyang Girls' High School. She picked up English Language by common usage. She has always been a housewife. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have 12 grandchildren; four in Singapore, two in Kuala Lumpur and six in Melbourne, Australia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early 1941 after 11 1/2 years service with the Straits Times, I resigned because the vacant post of Circulation Chief Clerk was not offered to me, I joined the United Press Association, an American news agency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the war, in spite of my long hours in the UPA, I served in the ARP (Air Raid Precautions). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family survived the war. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no job in sight and no money, I had to set up a stall in front of the SHB Quarters at Kampong Bahru selling odds and ends, including mosquito destroyers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the war ended, I was again \"penniless\". I did not have even a dollar of British currency. But, within a month of the liberation of Singapore the UPA correspondent, Charles McQuown-Wright, contacted me through the Straits Times. He advanced me S$50 to start life afresh. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through many years of hard work, my position in the UPA improved steadily and in the early 1950s I was Office Manager-cum-Chief Correspondent for Singa- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pore, Malaya, Borneo and Brunei, reporting to an American Manager for South East Asia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959 when the PAP had romped into power, the top executives of the Straits Times decided to move to Kuala Lumpur - Simmons, Hoffman, Siew Yee, and T S Khoo. I was approached to rejoin the Straits Times as Deputy Editor (Singapore), literally the head of the editorial department in Singapore. It was, to say the least, a very difficult job. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970 until the day I retired in 1973, I was Editorial Manager. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973 Foreign Minister Rajaratnam asked me to go to Kuala Lumpur as High Commissioner. I served seven years in this post until August 31st, 1980. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1980 1 took up my post in Tokyo as Ambassador to Japan and the Republic of Korea. l held the post for 3 1/2 years until 30th April 1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On lst May l984 I was appointed Chairman of SBC. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides working and making a living, the best years of my life (20-55) were spent mainly on and for badminton in Singapore and Malaysia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At various times also I had served in charitable bodies including the blind, the deaf and SATA. For several years I was Chairman of SATA succeeding the late G H Kiat. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was an all-round sportsman but only did well in badminton. I played table-tennis, basketball, soccer, swimming, athletics and finally golf. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973 I was awarded the Public Service Star and in 1979 the Meritorious Service Medal. In 1966 I was appointed a Justice of the Peace.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recounts his life without pretensions. He was ceaselessly striving, not for high and mighty pursuits, but simply to make a living, to help his family, to share some of the joys of life with his fellow men. He did his share of public service as a Justice of the Peace and did charitable work for the blind, the deaf, and through SATA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His resume is a vineyard of life in Singapore across those decades for someone who was a Straits-born and English educated. Now in his 69th year, he does not hanker after high office. He was happy and content with his life as he has lived it, and looked forward to what he was doing in SBC. When persuaded and convinced, he agreed to accept office as a matter of responsibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I carry the uncomfortable knowledge that sometimes I have done a person harm by inviting him to take high office. It has meant upsetting the even tenor of other people's settled lives. Worse, it has made their later adjustment to ordinary life, after leaving office, very difficult. He knew that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this job would not be for life. The President after him is likely to be elected by the whole electorate. His term is for four years. But it may turn out to be less than four years, if the amendments to our Constitution for a President to be elected by the electorate are ready before then. I asked him, therefore, what he would do after the Presidency? How would he adjust to life? He replied: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I was \"His Excellency\" for over 10 years in Kuala Lumpur and in Tokyo. I have had no trouble becoming a private citizen again. I do not expect any problems after I cease to be President.' \n  <br>\n  <br>He has his head firmly placed between his shoulders. He has a sense of proportion and perspective. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked for and he received my assurance that he need not change his social life. Indeed, for his sense of balance and a continuing touch with reality, he has to keep up his circle of friends and his usual social activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend him to this House. I beg to move the resolution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>2.50 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Minister of State for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Community Development (Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion tabled by the Prime Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since time immemorial, it has been the wish of the people to have the worthy and the able as their national leaders. Mencius said: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If a ruler gives honour to men of talent and virtue and employs the able, the capable, so that offices shall be filled by individuals of distinction and mark, then all the scholars of the empire will be pleased and wish to stand in his court.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Book of Rites, too, said: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When the Great Way was practised, the world was shared by all alike. The worthy and the able were promoted to office and men practised good faith and lived in affection. Therefore they did not regard as parents only their own parents, or as sons only their own sons. The aged found a fining close to their lives, the robust their proper employment; the young were provided with an upbringing.' \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our election system may be different, but our objective is the same. In other words, only the \"worthy\" and the \"capable\" among the individuals of distinction and mark are eligible for the office of the Head of State. Only in this way can our national prestige and dignity be upheld and the people live in peace and prosperity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Kim Wee is a veteran journalist who had been invited by the Government to serve as Singapore's envoy to Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, to strengthen ties with them. Following his diplomatic service, Mr Wee was appointed Chairman of the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation. With his extensive knowledge and experience, he has provided educational information and entertainment to the broad masses of listeners and viewers in Singapore. From his past career and the Prime Minister's earlier description of him, Mr Wee can well be regarded as a \"worthy\" and \"capable\" person. Therefore, Mr Wee is the most suitable choice for the highest office of the Republic of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the current economic downturn, Singapore is in dire need of a morale booster to overcome the numerous difficulties. With the highest office of the Republic of Singapore left vacant for nearly five months filled by this capable person, the control room of S.S. \"Singapore\" is now fully manned by a crew of suitable people. This will definitely strengthen the confidence and hope of all passengers on board. May we develop the spirit of sailing in the same boat so that Singapore will continue to progress and prosper. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby support the Prime Minister's motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin (MacPherson):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister to elect Mr Wee Kim Wee as the President of the Republic of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find the right person for this high office of President of the Republic of Singapore is not an easy task. The attributes that are required of such a person are very demanding. He must not only be a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> man of stature but he must also possess innate qualities that will endear him to the people of Singapore. He must further have the temperament as well as the bearing to uphold the dignity of the office and command the respect and trust of the people of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Kim Wee is eminently qualified to be elected to this high office of President. Those who know him have no doubts that he has all the major attributes to make a good President. Though he did not have the benefit of a University education, he had in fact a better and more comprehensive education by going through life and coming up the very hard way. It is really the rough and tumble of life that is the real test of a person's mettle which no amount of schooling and passing of examinations can be equal to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to leave school and go out to work to earn a living at the age of 15. At that time, only the privileged minority whose parents could afford it were sent to school and finished their education. It was a generation who had to work and struggle hard to get up in life. They belong to a generation who had in them the spirit of our early pioneers. It was that generation whose efforts made what Singapore is today. This spirit can be termed the \"Singapore spirit\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our present system of parliamentary democracy, our President is the Head of State. Though he has only limited Constitutional powers and acts on the advice of the Cabinet, he is the symbol of the unity, loyalty and aspirations of the people of Singapore. Thus the elevation of a person with Mr Wee Kim Wee's background, distinguished career and accomplishments to the Presidency, is not only appropriate but also symbolizes our embodiment of the \"Singapore spirit\" in the Presidency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Mr Wee Kim Wee's hard experience of life that make for better understanding of human feelings and human suffering, those who are acquainted with him know that he has other likeable qualities of being warm hearted, friendly and helpful. All these will endear him to the ordinary Singaporean. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that not only will my other fellow Members of Parliament support this motion with enthusiasm but the vast majority of the people of Singapore will welcome his election as our Fourth President with acclamation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Yatiman Yusof (Kampong Kembangan) (in Malay):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the motion moved by the Right Honourable Prime Minister to elect Mr Wee Kim Wee as the Fourth President of the Republic of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee is not a stranger to us. His excellent record of service to the nation by way of his career and social service goes beyond the borders of our country. Furthermore, since he was a former journalist and a resident of my constituency, his election as President is most welcome and is of special significance to us, particularly to me. On behalf of the residents of Kampong Kembangan and all the Members of this House, I would like to record our heartiest congratulations and highest appreciation to him, his wife and his family for having decided to come forward to serve the nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee's election as President marks an important change in the history of Singapore. It reflects the maturity of thought on the part of the multi-racial people of Singapore. This is the first time that a citizen from a non-minority community has been proposed for election as President, the highest office in the land. I am convinced that, after hearing the speech made by the Rt. Hon. Prime Minister, the Government has good reasons for proposing his election and is convinced that he is the most suitable person for this Office. I agree with this view. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of his contribution to the nation, it is evident that Mr Wee's services loom much larger than the man himself. His election is most appropriate. He is a man of high integrity, a firm believer in and upholder of family life, friendly to all, most caring of the lot of the less fortunates and in his heart he has always loved peace among mankind. His election as President, therefore, is very significant to Singapore. Although he has been called \"Mr Average\", Mr Wee is actually very energetic and a man of high aspirations. He is a man \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> who aspires to advance himself because he has risen up from the post of clerk to that of a leading diplomat. Mr Wee is a very good example of the product of our democracy and our open system of meritocracy that enables the common man like him to rise up to the highest office in the Singapore society. Like Singapore, he has a high degree of resilience because at an age when others would withdraw from public service or retire, he is still steady, active and fully confident and ready to shoulder this new task. I am fully confident that he will succeed, and Singapore, I feel, is fortunate to be able to share the warmth and friendliness of his personality, as a person who is well-known in Singapore. With his vast experience as a journalist and as a diplomat, he knows full well the meaning of war and peace, the danger and harm of communal riots and civil war, and the sensitivities of national and regional politics, but his biggest advantage lies in his own curriculum vitae, character and personality. He can act as a bridge between the ruling elite and the masses. Through his actions that are padded with courtesy, respectfulness and integrity, he can easily establish close rapport with the ordinary workers or the professionals and intellectuals, and will be able to voice all the wishes, hopes and aspirations which are also the aspirations, hopes and wishes of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion to elect Mr Wee Kim Wee as President. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I shall be very brief. I rise to assure Mr Wee Kim Wee of my and my Party's support for his nomination as President. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we note that he moved over to the Straits Times soon after the PAP took control of Singapore. It is a moot point, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, whether the Straits Times has served the people of Singapore or has served the Government, but we are not going to hold it against Mr Wee Kim Wee, and we welcome his appointment as President. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Party and I join my colleague, the Member for Anson, in congratulating Mr Wee Kim Wee for his appointment to this very high and prestigious office. I am sure he will be known as the President of the people and he has made a point that he wants to lead his normal social life, and I believe he is the one man who will probably succeed in that - holding a very high office and at the same time leading the life of an ordinary person. I welcome the appointment of Mr Wee Kim Wee to this very high office. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion moved by the Hon. Prime Minister to elect Mr Wee Kim Wee as the Fourth President of our Republic. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last three days much has been said about Mr Wee, Mrs Wee, his family, his work, his achievements and contribuions, and I do not intend to go over the same ground. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have personally known Mr Wee Kim Wee since he assumed his diplomatic duties in Kuala Lumpur and have had occasions to be with him in Kuala Lumpur, Tokyo and Seoul and have seen him in front-line operation. All I can say, Sir, is that his contributions in the field of political, economic and foreign relations are immeasurable. I read somewhere that a good ambassador has three main qualities: (1) a love for his country; (2) political genius; and (3) learned eloquence to present his facts. I do not think we can fault Mr Wee on any one of the above. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee was and is actively involved in social, charitable and sporting bodies since the 1950's. He has served in various capacities. I am certain that the sporting community in Singapore will find a very welcome patron in Mr Wee. His involvement in sports both as a participant and official would be a model for many of us to follow. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other social body close to Mr Wee, I am told, is the Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association. Before his departure from Singapore for his diplomatic postings, Mr Wee served as a Council Member \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and also Chairman of SATA. He took a very keen interest in the affairs of SATA. Only yesterday the Director of SATA mentioned to me that two months ago Mr Wee invited him for lunch to get an update of the activities of SATA. This shows that his care and concern is a continuing one. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as our President, I am confident that Mr Wee Kim Wee will enhance the office of the Presidency. His integrity and exemplary conduct and life-style is worthy of emulation. A man of humble origins, Mr Wee Kim Wee can walk tall among Kings, Presidents and Prime Ministers, and yet be at home with the common man. This is the real measure of the man. He is, I believe, the epitome of meritocracy in Singapore, having risen through the ranks to reach the highest and the most prestigious office in the land. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in my opinion, Mr Wee Kim Wee is a small man who has done big things for Singapore and himself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Article 17 of the Constitution, elects Mr Wee Kim Wee as President of the Republic of Singapore.

Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main purpose of the amendments is to achieve the objective of reducing the number of accidents on our roads, to ensure smoother and safer traffic flow and to improve traffic safety management. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main amendments on which I will touch are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) measures to require learner motor-cycle riders not to learn on public roads; \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) measures against drunken driving; and, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) increasing the maximum compoundable fines for traffic offences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The context in which these measures should be viewed, Sir, are the fact that the road accident rate has been rising steadily from 1978 to 1984. There were 278 road deaths in 1978 compared to 327 in 1984. The number of vehicles on our roads has been increasing at the rate of 6-7% each year. The Traffic Police therefore embarked on a comprehensive programme to reduce the number of accidents and to ensure a smoother flow as well as a safer traffic flow. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that these measures included the following: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring of the demerit system for errant drivers as well as Fixed Penalty Scheme for traffic violations. Secondly, we introduced the Japanese method of training and re-training of drivers. Thirdly, the riding and driving tests were also upgraded to improve the standard of riding motorcycles and driving on our roads. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicity and education programmes on road safety were stepped up as well. Enforcement action, though not always popular but necessary, also was intensified. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the first measure, that of requiring learner motorcycle riders not to learn on public roads. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are 135,000 motorcycles in Singapore. They constitute 27.6% of all motor vehicles. In 1984, motorcyclists involved in fatal accidents accounted for 35.5% of road accident fatalities. Motorcyclists with provisional driving licences (PDLs) are more prone to accidents than motorcyclists with qualified driving licences (QDLs). 23 learner riders were killed and 827 others injured in accidents last year alone. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major problem, of course, has been that the motorcyclists hitherto are allowed to learn by riding on public roads by trial and error. They needed only to pass the Highway Code Test and attend a half-day \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Pre-PDL course before they were given a PDL which gave them full freedom to ride on public roads, which, of course, is unsatisfactory, as inadequately trained PDL riders constitute a danger to themselves and to other road users. In other countries like Japan, PDL riders are not allowed on public roads. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the high rate of accidents involving PDL riders, all unqualified riders will not be allowed on public roads when the Act comes into operation. Only riders with qualified driving licences will be allowed on public roads. Malaysian learner riders will also be subject to the same rule. In this connection, Sir, the Traffic Police also have stopped renewing existing PDLs or issuing new PDLs from April 1985. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to give PDL riders enough time to obtain their QDLs, more than 1 1/2 years' notice was given for this measure. The Traffic Police also made arrangements for these 'L' riders to have more opportunities to go for these tests. From December 1984, arrangements were made for the 'L' riders to ballot for vacant testing slots. Tests were also conducted during the weekends. With the additional facilities, tests conducted per month increased from 5,000 to 8,000. A sample survey showed that, on the average, a PDL rider who turned up for the tests had taken three to four tests. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Motor Traders' Association in conjunction with the Traffic Police had also conducted free lessons to assist 'L' riders to pass their tests. The pass rates have improved from 16.6% in the first quarter of 1984 to 27.7% in the corresponding period of 1985. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When learner riders will no longer be allowed on public roads, they will have to undergo the training at an approved riding circuit to attain a sufficiently high standard in the theory and practice of handling and riding a motorcycle. Following this and on successful passing of the riding tests, they will receive their Class 11 QDL for motorcycles. The first riding circuit at Ang Mo Kio has already commenced operations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the other measures concerning drunken driving. With regard \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to drunken driving, Sir, we intend to introduce the use of breathalysers, and further, to make the level of blood alcohol content more stringent. The number of serious and fatal accidents involving drivers and motorcycle riders while under the influence of alcohol has been increasing. Between 1975 and 1978, there was only an average of 79 cases per year of drivers who had committed traffic violations under the influence of alcohol. This number rose to 126 cases per year for the period 1979 to 1982 and 129 cases per year for the period 1982 to 1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the breathalyser, Sir, presently, when a driver is suspected to be under the influence of alcohol, he will be brought to a hospital for blood and urine tests. This is a troublesome as well as an unpopular procedure - both for the individual and the Police, It is, therefore, proposed that the breathalyser, which is a simple equipment which can indicate the level of alcohol in a person's blood through a breath test, be used as a screening device for suspected drunken drivers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress that the breathalyser will be used only for screening because in other countries, the breathalyser readings can be used in court as evidence. In New Zealand and France, for example, the result of the breath test alone can be used in prosecuting drunken drivers, although the suspect has the right to ask for a blood test. In other countries, there are variations. In England, the results of breath tests can only be used as evidence in addition to the blood or urine tests. In Japan, a confirmatory blood test is necessary in order to convict a drunken driver in court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are proposing to use the breathalysers for screening suspected drunken drivers only. Where the reading on the breathalyser exceeds the legal prescribed limit, the driver will be brought to hospital for confirmatory blood and urine tests. In other words, with the breathalysers, the Traffic Police will have an easy-to-use screening device to detect drunken drivers and the law will therefore have to be amended for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to the maximum level of blood alcohol content. In Singa- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pore, the law prescribes the highest permissible level of alcohol in blood at 110 milligrams (mg) of alcohol in 100 millilitres (ml) of blood which is not as strict as the limits imposed in other countries. Many developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France, adopt the limit of 80 mg/100 ml. In Japan, the limit is even stricter at 50 mg/100 ml. In the United States, the limit is 60 mg/100 ml in all except two of the states. Evidence has shown that many drivers would show impairment of driving skill when their blood alcohol content level reaches 30 to 50 mg per 100 ml; at blood alcohol levels of 50 to 100 mg per 100 ml, the driving skills of most individuals will certainly be adversely affected and deteriorate rapidly, even in the case of a hardened drinker or an experienced driver. Amending the legal blood alcohol content level from the existing 110 mg/100 ml to 80 mg/100 ml will serve to deter motorists from driving if they consume alcohol excessively. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I turn now to the third main amendment, Sir, which is to increase the maximum amount to which traffic offences could be compounded to $200. There are several reasons for this. First, the present amount of $50, which has been in the law since 1966, is unrealistic. Secondly, under the Fixed Penalty System which was introduced in 1982, traffic violations were grouped into four categories according to the severity of the offence. Fixed fines ranging from $20 to $50 were imposed. Today, the amount of $50 for certain of the more serious offences, such as careless driving and failing to give way to ambulances and fire engines, is inadequate to serve as a deterrent. Some of the more serious offences are therefore not compounded. Because the maximum compoundable fine is $50, offenders of these more serious offences, such as inconsiderate driving, speeding far in excess of road or vehicle speed limit, are brought to court where they are given more serious sentences, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the maximum compoundable fine for traffic offences raised to $200, most road offences could be compounded by the Traffic Police instead of being referred to the court. The list of compoundable offences can also be adjusted and more realistic composition fines set. Only the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> more serious offences will be referred to the courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress, Sir, that traffic offenders will, even after this amendment, still pay composition fines of $50 or less for most offences. However, with this amendment, we will be able to consider a more rational approach, such as drawing a line between offences that result in accidents and those that do not, when penalizing offenders. At present, they are pegged at the same level. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, at present, moving offences committed by drivers of heavy vehicles are given equal treatment as those committed by light vehicles. Heavy vehicles, by virtue of their size and construction, pose greater potential danger to other road users if not handled properly and carefully. Statistics have shown that heavy vehicles are about four times as prone to accidents than lighter vehicles. In some countries like Japan, the traffic authorities have taken cognizance of this fact and higher fines are imposed on heavy vehicles. We are considering doing likewise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new maximum will also enable the Traffic Police to offer composition for some offences which are at present referred to court because of the $50 limit which is deemed to be inadequate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other amendments, which are referred to in the Explanatory Statement, are really intended to remove inconsistencies in the existing law or to facilitate smoother administration of the law or are of a technical nature. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, earlier this year I had raised in this House the need to impose stiffer penalties for drivers who commit traffic offences which resulted in serious accidents. The Amendment Bill to the Road Traffic Act, as I understand, is to provide greater supportive measures to the Traffic Police to further improve traffic management and enforcement action on errant and recalcitrant drivers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise a few points for the Hon. Minister's consideration. Firstly, it is indeed heartening to observe that there \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is a significant drop in fatality rates for the first six months of this year. Although the fatality rates for motorcyclists have decreased substantially, I wonder whether it is due to stricter enforcement action or to the decrease in the number of PDL motorcyclists on the road, bearing in mind that the Traffic Police had stopped renewing or issuing new PDLs since lst April this year.1 also observed that there is no mention of whether there is any possibility of introducing separate lanes for motorcyclists as a further means of traffic control. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to touch on is a new source of road menace, ie, the mobile concrete mixers. Most of the drivers of these vehicles drive well in excess of the speed limit of 40 kmh, especially along major roads, like Bukit Timah and the PanIsland Expressway. Imagine the disastrous consequences if these vehicles were to meet with an accident. Years ago, we had the problem posed by drivers of sand lorries travelling along Tampines Road, Despite the stricter enforcement action taken by the Traffic Police, these drivers ignored traffic regulations with impunity. I suspect the wages of these drivers are based on the number of trips made between the source of supply and the construction sites. If this is the case, then we should consider other measures, like restricting the movement of these heavy vehicles to off-peak hours, to enable them to make more trips without resorting to speeding and also fixing of speed regulating governors on the vehicles, or even penalizing the owners of the vehicles should an accident occur. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to serious traffic offences committed by drivers of foreign registered vehicles, I would like to find out from the Hon. Minister whether there are adequate measures to apprehend and penalize such errant drivers who are involved in serious traffic accidents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a clarification I would like to seek from the Hon. Minister on clause 8 which provides a definition for the size of a motor vehicle. It states that the vehicle should not exceed 4.0 metres. I am wondering whether we should not also consider looking at the width of a vehicle. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> In modern transportation, there are many vehicles which have a very much larger width than the older vehicles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last point I wish to make is the need to have more publicity in the mass media on serious traffic accidents and prosecution of offenders. This will help to bring home the point of the need for greater road safety. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Amendment Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed (Eunos):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill moved by the Hon. Minister for Home Affairs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is beyond dispute that there is a close correlation between vehicle growth and accident rate. Although road death statistics are just beginning to come down, it is not an occasion to rejoice and be complacent. We should continue to be vigilant and endlessly strive to improve traffic management on our roads. This downward trend is still too early to confirm that current measures are adequate, bearing in mind that there could be a repeat of the high incidence of road deaths as was evidenced during 1978 to 1984 as given by the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us pause for a moment and cast our minds on our existing roads and expressways. Often times, we feel helpless seeing our thoroughfares being turned into racing circuits that send shivers down the spines of the more considerate and safety-conscious road users. Our traffic law enforcement officers cannot be around all the time. There is, therefore, a need for more stringent deterrents to be implemented to minimize traffic accidents and traffic violations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision in the proposed Bill is not meant to unfairly penalize the motoring public. It is selective and discriminatory and it is directed only at those road users who are more prone or more likely to contribute to road accidents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the assurance given by the Minister that the proposed Bill will still permit traffic offenders to pay composition fines of $50 or less for most offences, although the maximum compoundable fine will be raised to $200. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I view with deep concern at the alarming statistics disclosed by the Hon. Minister, in particular the high motor cyclist fatalities and increasing cases of drunken driving on our roads. We would be failing in our duty if we do not do more to make our roads safer for the public. I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Home Affairs that its officers, in enforcing these new measures, will exercise their utmost care and discretion when dealing with the motoring public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I once again support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in so far as this Bill takes measures to reduce the accidents on the roads and to increase the safety of other road users, we of course support the Bill. But whatever measures we take, Mr Deputy Speaker, should not be seen or construed as being discriminatory of any particular user or users of the roads. This is why I ask, by way of clarification more than anything else, the position of all the motor cyclists who at the moment hold provisional driving licences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see in a report that was published in the papers sometime in April of this year when the Police, I think, announced the decision to stop issuing PDLs, that there were about 21,000 holders of provisional driving licences. The report went on to give some figures of those who passed every week, and giving the maximum passes that the Police were hoping would result, there would still nevertheless be a balance of about 3,000 to 4,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what will be their position when this law comes into force? This law, when it comes into force and if it penalizes those who are already in possession of provisional driving licences, would make it retroactive, That in itself is a bad principle. I would ask the Minister to consider whether it should be made retroactive for those who are in possession of valid PDLs at the time the law comes into force. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether I misheard the Minister or misunderstood him, but I understood him to say that, after the coming into force of this amendment, motor cyclists would be given their proper licences, ie, not provisional driving \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> licences, after they had completed their course and passed the test. But I see that the amendment, clause 2, subclause (4), still talks about \"a provisional licence to drive a motor cycle\" being granted to those who have \"completed a prescribed course of training to enable him to obtain a provisional licence.\" I suppose there must be an explanation for this. Is it still the intention to continue to issue provisional licences for motor cyclists? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I ask whether, in relation to their numbers as compared to motor cars and other vehicles on the roads, the motor cyclists are responsible for a greater share of the accidents? One has to look at it in proportion to their numbers compared with the numbers of other motor vehicles. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, I wish to thank the speakers who have spoken on the Bill. The Member for Toa Payoh has raised several points. He has referred to certain press publicity of encouraging trends in the drop of fatalities, and whether we could, with confidence, attribute this to any particular reason. I for one would like to be more cautious and await further statistics for several more months before venturing a firm conclusion on whether there is a downward trend which we can attribute to any of the measures that have been taken. And I hope at a suitable date to give all the figures publicly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his suggestion of separate lanes, this is a matter which is being looked into as part of the overall traffic safety improvement scheme. The point he made about heavy cement mixers is also taken. I think this is one of the types of vehicles with which we are concerned about, which leads us to think of special measures for heavy vehicles. Cement mixers, I am sure, will also be classified under the category of \"heavy vehicle.\" One can easily imagine the different consequences if a light vehicle crashes into a crowded bus station and compare it to a cement mixer which also crashes into a crowded bus station. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of width, whether we should also have more stringent specificaions, is a matter I will take up with other departments because several departments are involved in this, including the Registry \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of Vehicles. As to publicity, I completely share his view that we ought to encourage and get the cooperation of the Press and Television to publicize the consequences of road accidents. I am glad to say that the Press and Television have indeed, from time to time, tried to assist us in driving this message home to the public, and I am confident that they will continue to perform this public interest message in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point made by the Member for Eu nos, I have taken note of his points, particularly his call for more vigilance to be taken against hell-riders. I can assure him that the implementation of the provisions will be done carefully as he has advocated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the main point raised by the Member for Anson was that the measures which would disallow motor cyclists with PDL from going on the public roads after the commencement of operation of this Act would be unfair, that it is retroactive, and so on. I do not think I can agree with him that it is retroactive because nearly two years' notice has been given of this measure, and such ample notice was given precisely to enable them to take full advantage of the opportunities and facilities which we have provided for them to obtain the QDL. Just to give an example to the Member of the facilities which allowed so many to pass. At the end of 31st December, 1984, there were 17,678 \"L\" riders - persons in possession of PDLs. At the end of 31st July, 1985, there were only 7,013. In other words, during this period, more than 10,400 PDL holders took advantage of the facilities and got their QDLs. Now, as to the remaining figures, I do not think it is retroactive for them. If they were given repeated chances, some as many as three or four, and they still did not make it, the question is: do we want to put them on the road when they have failed to pass the test after three times? Do we want to put them on the public roads? Will it be safe for them and for other members of the public? This residual figure also includes an unknown quantity of persons who have taken provisional \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> driving licences and have not reported for the test. In other words, there are many who have taken a PDL for a variety of reasons and may not even have ever ridden a motor cycle. That is the problem. I think the figures that I have given show that a vast majority have taken the opportunity provided to them and have passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised by the Member concerning the drafting - I myself have had this checked with the draftsman, the Attorney-General's Chambers, and I am assured that clause 4 of section 36, as amended, although worded in that way, would have the effect that we intend, that is to say, after the commencement of the operation of the Act, we will not be issuing PDLs to any motor cycle riders. The Member for Anson also wanted certain figures of motor cyclist fatalities vis-a-vis other fatalities. I do not have those figures here, but if he wants, I can supply him those figures at a later date. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have covered all the points. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. S.

The total value of such loans is now $18.2 billion and the bulk of this has been borrowed from the CPF. The provisions in the Development Loan Ordinances and Acts provide firm guarantees that not only will interest on borrowings be paid regularly but also that each loan will be redeemed in full when it matures. In particular, the legislation stipulates that a sinking fund be set up for each loan and annual contributions made from the Consolidated Fund to the sinking fund. The contributions to the sinking fund together with interest earned on these would in normal circumstances be sufficient to redeem the loan when it is due for repayment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1968, in addition to the mandatory annual contributions, Government has made accelerated or enhanced contributions to the various sinking funds. Owing to the enhanced contributions, the total amount in the sinking funds is now $11.5 billion, more than sufficient to meet current domestic loan obligations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of making enhanced contributions is a prudent measure to ensure that there are always sufficient reserves to redeem domestic loans, the bulk of which have been raised from the CPF, when these fall due. In particular, enhanced contributions should be made in those years when revenue performance is good so that contributions could be reduced during lean years while ensuring that there are sufficient funds to redeem the loans on maturity. Also, it was considered that such contributions were not prohibited by law as the various Development Loan Ordi- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> nances and Acts only specified minimum contributions that had to be made. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the previous Parliament, in a Report released last year, agreed that it was prudent to make enhanced contributions to the sinking funds. The PAC, however, requested the Auditor-General to seek the advice of the Attorney-General on the law in relation to such enhanced contributions. The Attorney-General subsequently advised that any doubt about the interpretation of the law could be removed by amending legislation to make specific provision in the various Development Loan Ordinances and Acts for enhanced contributions to sinking funds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Loan (Amendment) Bill, 1985, therefore, seeks to provide specific sanction in statute for this long-standing and prudent practice which has resulted in the sinking funds now being more than sufficient to redeem all current domestic loan obligations when these fall due. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new subsection within the existing section on sinking funds in each of the Development Loan Ordinances and Acts listed in the first column of the Schedule to the Bill. The new subsection will enable the Minister to authorize enhanced contributions to be made to any sinking fund subject to the total amount in the sinking fund at any time not exceeding the outstanding principal sum of the domestic loan. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to regularize enhanced contributions that have been made in the past or that might be made between now and the coming into operation of the amending legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.52 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance and Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance and Minister for Health (Dr Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill seeks to give legislative authority to the income tax concessions announced in the 1985 budget statement. Opportunity is also taken to include four other amendments to the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was announced in the 1985 budget statement that with effect from the year of assessment 1986, all individual taxpayers will be allowed to deduct their course fees incurred towards obtaining professional or academic qualifications. Fees for approved courses related to the individual's trade, business, profession, vocation or employment can also be offset against his income. Tax deductibility is subject to a maximum of $2,000 per taxpayer for each year of assessment. Clause 5 of the Bill provides for this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our present laws, a tax credit is available only if income is remitted from a country with which Singapore has an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation or a Commonwealth country. In the 1985 budget statement, a unilateral tax credit was made available for offset against overseas taxes suffered on income derived from services rendered by resident taxpayers in selected non-treaty countries. Clause 6 of the Bill empowers the Minister to prescribe regulations to determine the type of income which will enjoy the concession and the countries from which such income is derived. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move to the other amendments to the Act. Clause 2 amends section 14(l)(e) of the Act to bring it in line with the increases in CPF contributions by employers, reflecting the increases to 23% in July 1983 and 25% in July 1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, section 19(A) of the Act was amended to allow all plant and machinery to be depreciated over three years but the effective date of this concession was unintentionally restrictive. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 includes an amendment to clarify that such capital expenditure incurred during or after the basis period to the year of assessment 1985 can be written off over three years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, computers, robots and office automation equipment can be fully depreciated in one year. Clause 3 also extends this one year write-off to automated production equipment which would take effect from the year of assessment 1985. Unclaimed residual allowances in respect of existing automated production equipment will also be allowed the full set off in one year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 25 of the Act provides that capital allowances claimed and granted before separation from Malaysia in 1965 will continue to be recognized under Singapore laws after Separation. Clause 4 of the Bill is a technical amendment to make clear that Part XV of the Act mentioned in section 25 refers to a provision which was in force before the year of assessment 1966 but has since been repealed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>STATE OF THE ECONOMY</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>3.57 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this House, noting with concern the present problems with the economy, commends the Trade Unions and the workers for their responsible attitude towards wages; and supports the measures so far taken by the Government and urges the Government to take all further steps necessary for the Nation to adapt to the changing environment, including steps to strengthen the role of local businesses in the economy.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first deal with the current economic problems, We are facing difficult times. Our economy has slowed down and stagnated. The economic growth rate has declined continuously in the last six \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> quarters - from 9.9% in the first quarter of 1984 to minus 1.4% in the second quarter of 1985. This year, the economic growth rate may turn out to be the lowest since our independence in 1965. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everywhere we go we hear businessmen, shopkeepers, restaurant owners and other people complaining that business is bad. My CCC members also told me that this year hungry ghosts may stay hungry as Seventh Moon Festival organizers cut back their cost of operations. Some Seventh Moon Festival reduced the number of dinner tables, others decided to do away with wayangs, sing-song and whatever. So restaurant owners, wayang operators and actors have lower income and therefore spend less. Here we observe the multiplier effect working in the grassroots economy, but in a negative sense. I ask myself this question: \"Is our economic situation really that bad?\" Yes, we are facing difficulties, but we are not facing a crisis. If you read the forecast by Wharton School of Economics, University of Pennsylvania, and the forecast by some American banks, it seems to me that many foreigners have more confidence about us than some of our own people. We Parliamentarians, as elected representatives of the people, must assure our people that we can and will overcome our current economic problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question I ask myself: \"What went wrong? What caused the present economic difficulties?\" Let me here offer some of my observations. Basically, there are two causes. Internally, our economy is undergoing structural changes. We are in the transitional period. First, wages increased rapidly in the last few years, In 1979 to 1981, wages increased as a result of the high wage policy. However, wages continued to rise after 1981 because of tight labour market conditions. Productivity did increase in the last five years. However, productivity growth has yet to catch up with the wage increase. As a result, unit labour cost increased. The second internal factor, Sir, was that labour intensive, low-skill, low-value-added industries and other economic activities were phased out by high wages, but new high tech, high-value-added and high-skill industries and economic activities have not been established fast enough or in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sufficient number to occupy the central stage of our economy. There is a third internal factor. The construction boom is over. Not only the construction sector itself is affected, but also businessmen who have used their property, either commercial or residential property, as collateral to raise loans, find it difficult to raise sufficient loans. So there is a chain effect. They face a credit squeeze. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Externally, the demand for our goods and services also declined. We are highly dependent on the world market. This is not a result of conscious choice, but it is a matter of economic survival, We have no other options. We have no agricultural base to fall back on. We have no natural resources to exploit. We can only make use of our only resource, namely, human resource, and take advantage of our geographical location and infrastructure which we have painfully built up in the last 25 years to manufacture goods and offer services for the world markets. We also buy from the world markets what are needed by our people and our economy food, raw materials, machinery, equipment and even water. In this way, our economy is plugged into the world economic system. This linkage gives us economic prosperity, but it also makes our economy vulnerable to changes in world economic conditions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now analyse the three economic external factors which affect our economy. First, the economic slow down of the industrialized nations and the protectionist measures adopted by some of our trading partners have further aggravated our economic situation. Our domestic exports of goods and services in the last few years failed to increase as rapidly as in 1969-1979. In the ten years, 1969-1979, the average growth rate of our domestic exports was 26.9% per annum. In 1981-1984, the growth rate of our domestic exports was only 6.6% per annum. In fact, in 1982, the growth rate of our domestic exports was negative, -1.0%. The second external factor, Sir, is specific to some industries. There are world-wide economic problems specific to some industries. For example, oil refineries and shipbuilding and repairing are suffering from excess capacity, excess supply and change in oil trade. Similarly, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> electronics and some sector of computer industry is undergoing a shake-out. Our refineries, shipyards, petro-chemical and electronic and computer industries cannot avoid these adverse conditions. A third economic external factor is the restraint imposed by our neighbouring countries on travel and expenditure of their own citizens outside their countries. These restraints have also affected our tourism and retail trade to some extent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At micro level, the internal and external causes which I have just mentioned would mean two things for most enterprises: (1) higher cost of operation and (2) decline in sales or turnover. Sir, I am going to argue that demand factor is more important than cost factor, both at macro and micro sense. It is true that part of the decline in external demand of some industries may be due to the loss of our competitive edge because of higher cost of operation. However, being a small open economy, decline in external demand is mainly due to exogenous factors over which we have no control. I have already identified some of these exogenous factors just now. Hence, the current economic problems could not be prevented even without higher costs of operation, or without wage increase and CPF increase in the last few years, though higher cost of operation would worsen the situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at enterprise or industry level, decline in demand seems to be more serious than high operating cost. Sir, you are a businessman. I think you understand this. When demand is high, turnover rapid, you and other businessmen have no complaints or less complaints. Costs are not a problem, When demand starts to decline, and wages, rents, interests and other costs fail to decline or fail to decline proportionately, costs begin to bite. Less efficient enterprises find it difficult to carry on, some enterprises may go under. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the other issue - CPF contribution rates and wages. In May and June, I already sensed there were pressures coming from the business community and other quarters on Government to reduce CPF contribution rates in order, as they argued, to reduce costs of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> operation. I have pointed out in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao on 18th July, that CPF contribution rate should not be used as an anti-cyclical measure. The CPF is not a levy; it is part of a worker's total wage. Reduction in employer's contribution rate alone will reduce worker's pay and worker's savings. Reduction in employee's contribution rate alone will reduce his savings but not his employer's operating costs. And reduction in CPF from both sides, employer and employee, as the Member for Anson once suggested, will reduce the worker's pay, his saving and his ability to own a flat. So let us not fiddle with CPF contribution rates, unless we are really facing a crisis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to wages. Wages reflect labour market conditions. We cannot expect wages to remain low when we experience rapid economic growth and labour shortage, Even without wage corrections in 1979-81, wages would have increased. However, we cannot simply look at wages or wage increase alone. Wage increase must be compared with productivity increase. If productivity increase can keep pace with wage increase, total wage cost will not go up. When we talk about wage costs of export industries, we must also compare our wage increase and productivity increase with such increases of our competitors. That is what competition in international market is all about. But here let me sound a word of caution: Competitiveness should not be achieved at the expense of the living standard of our workers. By cutting down wages, our competitiveness will surely improve but workers suffer. Wages must be allowed to increase when productivity increase, workers should be given a share of productivity gains. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our productivity did increase at an average rate of 4.6% in 1980-84, This is an improvement over the average productivity growth rate of 3.2% in 1975-79 before the wage correction policy was implemented. Moreover, our productivity performance in 1980-84 was better than the productivity performance of other newly industrialized countries in Asia. But the trouble is that this productivity growth rate still fell short of the average wage increase during 1980-84. During this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> period, total labour cost inclusive of CPF, SDF and payroll tax increased by about 10%. Productivity growth rate was only 4.6% per annum but labour cost increased by about 10%. Why has productivity increase lagged behind wage increase? The reason is simple: it is nearly effortless to increase wages, but to increase productivity, business enterprises must be prepared to invest more in capital, train their workers and upgrade their management systems. All these will take some time before productivity performance can be improved. Under these circumstances, and given our present economic problems, it is sensible to restrain wage increase for the time being until productivity growth catches up. In other words, wages have to increase at a much slower pace in the next two to three years. However, exceptions, as I argued just now, must be made for workers in enterprises whose productivity has increased rapidly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions and workers have, in fact, taken the first step towards wage restraint. They have decided to forgo this year's NWC wage increase. Trade unions and workers must be commended for taking this action. Their action will not only help to ease cost pressure on many enterprises but it will also send a strong signal to investors and potential investors that our workers are realistic and are willing to make adjustments in the interests of our nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice the Opposition Members have tabled a motion to cut Ministers' salaries and MPs' allowances and pensions by 25%. 1 wonder in what way this cut, if implemented, will help reduce operating costs of businesses and stimulate economic recovery. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> We will explain. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock:</b> The Opposition Members have to prove beyond doubt that the cut of Ministers' pay and MPs' allowances by 25% will revitalize the economy, otherwise, their motion will be rejected and dismissed by the people as another political gimmick. Our people are not that silly. Logically speaking, in order to make wage cuts an effective means for cost reduction, wage cuts must be made across the board. Managers, professionals, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> (including lawyers, of course), executives, technicians, workers, etc. all will receive lower wages and salaries. But what are the consequences of such a proposal? First, total disposable income of our economy will fall and total consumption expenditure decline. This will further aggravate the economic stagnation. Aggregate demand will fall further. Secondly, wage cuts across-the-board will be taken as a panic move, it will create such adverse psychological effects that people may start to believe that our whole economy is going down the drain. People's confidence and investor's confidence will be undermined. Therefore, wage cut is both unnecessary and undesirable. Let us prepare for the winter, but we need not burn down our house to keep ourselves warm. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let me turn to the economic measures and the Government response. Immediately after the last Budget debate, the Government responded quickly. In April, the Economic Committee under the Minister of State for Trade and Industry and Member for Teck Ghee was established. So far, the Government has implemented or announced a number of measures to tackle our current economic difficulties. These measures may be summarized in three categories: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) reduction of statutory boards' fees, levies and charges, and property tax. These measures will help reduce costs of operation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) pump-prime construction sector by bringing forward the infrastructural projects and by maintaining high level of public housing construction activities. These measures will help stimulate aggregate demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In addition, the Government has also announced specific schemes designed to induce risk-taking in high-tech investment and to assist local businesses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures deserve our support, as they attempt to tackle the problems at source. The Government may further consider certain fiscal measures, such as (1) lowering company profit tax rate, (2) temporary removal of the 3% cess on restaurants and hotels, and (3) normalize the anomaly in the way petrol duty was imposed. I hope the Minister for Trade and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Industry and the Minister for Finance are listening. I am particularly unhappy about the last measure, ie, the way we tax our petrol. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you recall, in the last Budget debate, I protested at the way petrol duty was imposed and I argued that the increase in petrol duty would lead to inflation. I was proven right. This is the consumer price index for the month of July 1985. If you compare the consumer price index of July 1984 with July 1985, you will see that the cost of transport and communications has gone up from $104.6 to $110.7, an increase of 5.8 percentage points during this one year period. Fortunately for us, prices of food items have declined. This has more than offset the increase in prices of transport and communications. As a result, our consumer price index increased by only 0.7%. Otherwise, the inflationary pressure would be much greater. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some quarters blamed the Government for not foreseeing the current economic difficulties, others held the Government responsible for the high costs of operation. These allegations and accusations are irresponsible and misleading. Our economy is a small open economy, just like a small sailing boat in the Pacific Ocean. A powerful wind will propel our economy full steam ahead, but a thunder storm may be enough to capsize our boat. No one can give us accurate weather forecast. This is the problem faced by all small open economies, not just Singapore. To manage such an open and small economy requires delicate skills, and so far the Government has been very successful. That is why we see the living standard going up and there is economic prosperity in the last 25 years. The economic restructuring is like strengthening the structure of our economic boat, so that it can ride the storm better and move faster ahead of our competitors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let me turn to the changing environment and the new challenges we face. Economic measures taken at this point must not aim at solving the current economic problems alone. They must be part of our economic strategies which will enable our economy to respond more \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> rapidly and effectively to the changing economic conditions and technological progress. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world economy, the old economic problems, such as slow-down of world trade expansion, protectionism, and the debt problem of the Third World countries and some Eastern European countries, are still hanging there, At the same time, new challenges have emerged: industrialized nations have started a re-industrialization drive, and their large corporations have adopted the strategies of investing behind each other's tariff walls. Some experts, such as Mr Kenichi Ohmae, a Japanese consultant with McKinsey &amp; Co, has warned of the 'Triad power' - the cooperation and linking up of the large corporations in the three economic polars - America, Western Europe and Japan. In the region, probably at the latest by the end of this century, we may see China emerging as an economic power, exporting large volumes of labour-intensive manufactured goods. This will alter the economic balance in the Asia-Pacific region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our domestic economy, we must realize the period of low-wage low-rent is over. We are moving up the technological ladder. To stand still is to be left behind; unless we move ahead of other countries in the region and countries with ample labour-supply, like India and China, we will be swamped. But when we enter the era of higher technology, we are confronted with a different set of problems: investors will face greater uncertainty and greater risk. Technological changes may render investment obsolete within a very short time, investors are therefore hesitant. At the same time, the industrialized nations and the NICs are all trying to identify the new growth industries. If too many move into the same industry with similar technological level, all will suffer from excess capacity; a potential growth industry (what the Prime Minister called the winner) may turn out to be a loser. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we prepare ourselves for these changing economic and technological environment? A few steps need to be taken: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To encourage research and development activities; \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To upgrade workers' training and education; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To provide information on technology, market and management system; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) To groom our local entrepreneurs; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) To encourage local businesses to link up with MNCs and foreign companies; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) To assist local businesses to improve on their production techniques and management systems, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these require not only the efforts of the Government but also the full support and cooperation of the people. How do we, as a people and a nation, face the challenges of the new era will determine what kind of future we have for ourselves and for our children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the last topic, ie, the local businesses. Small and medium-sized businesses have great disadvantages. They have many handicaps: high labour cost, low productivity, low capital investment, dis-economies of scale due to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> small size. Let me take some industries in the commerce and service sectors as examples. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, provision and sundry shops. In 1981, there were 4,625 such shops. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.

The flyover would stretch from the vicinity of MacRitchie Reservoir car park at Lornie Road to the vicinity of the Little Sisters of the Poor at the Upper Thomson Road end. The existing roads around the area would also be realigned to accommodate the flyover structures. Two pedestrian overhead bridges would be constructed to replace the existing ones affected by the project. A new underpass with ramps would also be built to provide for pedestrians crossing near the Little Sisters of the Poor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent surveys carried out by the Public Works Department (PWD) indicate that the peak hour traffic volumes at the junction of Thomson Road, Lornie Road and Braddell Road are well in excess of the designed capacities of these junctions. During the peak periods, the traffic flow is heaviest between Upper Thomson Road and Lornie Road. Traffic counts show that the morning and evening peak volumes between these two roads are 2,550 and 2,110 vehicles per hour respectively. The volume of traffic at the junction area is expected to increase much further with additional housing and industrial estate developments in the north eastern sector of Singapore. According to traffic forecast, the average morning and evening peak hour traffic through the junction area would increase by an average of 36% from the present 9,150 vehicles per hour to 12,920 per hour by 1990. Severe congestion can be expected if a flyover is not provided. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flyover, when constructed, will have a capacity of about 1,500 vehicles per hour per lane. Tenders for the project were called on 16 August 1985 and will close on 14 November 1985. The Public Works Department expects to award the contract by February 1986. The project will take 20 months to complete and the flyover can, therefore, be expected to be operational by October 1987. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In planning the alignment for the flyover, PWD has given due consideration to avoid existing structures as much as possible and to minimise acquisition of private lands. However, due to constraints imposed by the width and geometrics of the flyover and ground system, the drivers' quarters of the Little Sisters of the Poor and two temples, one along Upper Thomson Road, the other along Lornie Road, have to be demolished. The Little Sisters of the Poor will be appropriately compensated for the loss of the drivers' quarters. PWD is arranging with the Resettlement Department for the clearance and the resettlement of the two temples. In addition, lands on the slopes of the Mount Alvernia Hospital grounds abutting Braddell Road and the forecourt of the Shell Service Station at Lornie Road would be acquired, The operation of the Hospital and the Service Station should not be affected. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COMPANIES IN ARREARS OF</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD RENTALS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> asked the Minister or National Development what was the number of companies owing rents to the Housing and Development Board (i) for three to six months and (ii) for more than six months, for the year 1984 and for the period January-July 1985. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> In 1984, a monthly average of 366 tenants of HDB's industrial and commercial premises owed rents for three-six months.
