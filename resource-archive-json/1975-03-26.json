(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Tay Boon Too, Ang Nam Piau, L. P. Rodrigo, P. Govindaswamy, Sia Khoon Seong, N. Govindasamy and Ho Kah Leong.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make some comments on the\r\n\r\nrestructure of the education system,  to  which  a\r\n\r\nremarkable  amount  of publicity  has  been  given\r\n\r\nduring this Budget season - but outside the House.\r\n\r\nIn  the debate on the Minister of Finance's Budget\r\n\r\nstatement,  I  did  remark  adversely  on  certain\r\n\r\nstatements about restructure, but these statements\r\n\r\nwere  really  marginal to the statement  of  basic\r\n\r\nprinciple.  For  example,  I  disagreed  that  the\r\n\r\nchanges in the past 15 years had been minor and  I\r\n\r\nalso   felt  that  there  could  have  been   more\r\n\r\nconsultation  with teachers and  teachers'  bodies\r\n\r\nover the definition of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said this, where the basic principles\r\n\r\ngermane   to   restructure  are  concerned,   such\r\n\r\nprinciples have been stated in a manner that makes\r\n\r\nthe  restructure  look like the  answer  to  every\r\n\r\nteacher's   prayer.  Behold,  Mr   Speaker,   Sir,\r\n\r\nschooling  should  be made a more  meaningful  and\r\n\r\nenjoyable  experience;  continual  assessment   of\r\n\r\nacademic  performance shall ensure  that  children\r\n\r\nare  brought  through  their schooling  with  full\r\n\r\nappreciation   of   their   abilities   or   their\r\n\r\nlimitations.  By implication the very  intelligent\r\n\r\nwould not find schooling a boring experience,  and\r\n\r\nslow  developers would receive due  consideration.\r\n\r\nThe  promise  is made that every student  who  has\r\n\r\ncompleted  primary  education will  be  channelled\r\n\r\ninto  some  form  of  post-primary  education   or\r\n\r\ntraining.  Thus  by providing alternative  avenues\r\n\r\nfor  different  aptitudes, our resources  will  be\r\n\r\noptimally utilised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent seminar on the restructure of the\r\n\r\neducation  system, suggestions  were  sought  from\r\n\r\nparticipants  who were principals  from  all  over\r\n\r\nSingapore   regarding  how  to   achieve   certain\r\n\r\noutcomes that were envisaged as following upon the\r\n\r\naim   to   make  schooling  more  meaningful   and\r\n\r\nenjoyable   and   the  aim  to  ensure   continual\r\n\r\nassessment  of academic performance. Now  this  is\r\n\r\nthe  real  nub  of the restructure intention:  the\r\n\r\ndetermination  to  achieve this intention  and  to\r\n\r\nimplement  vigorously and steadily what  has  been\r\n\r\nconceived  of  as  a good plan.  Views  have  been\r\n\r\nsought  over aspects of implementation. Now  these\r\n\r\nviews  have  been  forthcoming, and  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nstress   on   certain  lines   of   action,   some\r\n\r\nrecommendations  standing out quite  clearly.  For\r\n\r\nexample,    children   should   have    pre-school\r\n\r\nexperience  through kindergarten; learning  should\r\n\r\nbe  through activities and experience that  appeal\r\n\r\nto the children's interest and imagination, as for\r\n\r\ninstance, excursions, projects, effective  use  of\r\n\r\napparatus  and aids, the application of a  variety\r\n\r\nof  methods  and techniques; resort to educational\r\n\r\nhardware,  necessitating of course the  production\r\n\r\nof corresponding soft ware, group teaching, multi-level  teaching and close monitoring  of  progress\r\n\r\nthrough     personal     observation,     informal\r\n\r\nquestioning, written assignments, stage by  stage,\r\n\r\nunit by unit. Above all, classroom size should  be\r\n\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has come out with a\r\n\r\nclassic  education proposal. In  soliciting  views\r\n\r\nover  implementation  they have  received  classic\r\n\r\neducational answers. Teachers are looking  forward\r\n\r\nto participating in this thrilling development. My\r\n\r\nobservation  has  been  that  most  teachers  have\r\n\r\nstretched themselves to the limit in their work in\r\n\r\nschools.  I am speaking here particularly  of  the\r\n\r\nprimary  schools  where the  new  policy  will  be\r\n\r\ninitiated.  Without the organisation  of  manpower\r\n\r\nand  resources to help the teachers, this proposal\r\n\r\nthat has been presented with such a bang will  end\r\n\r\nin a whimper. More manpower is required,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nmore    training    facilities   and    retraining\r\n\r\nfacilities. And certainly the production of  first\r\n\r\nclass   supervisors  in  the  shape   of   capable\r\n\r\neducation  development officers  who  will  really\r\n\r\nadvise  on development and not perpetuate the  old\r\n\r\ninspectors  role.  All these are  needed.  In  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  to the official November statement  on\r\n\r\nthe restructure there was recognition of all these\r\n\r\nneeds. If the Ministry makes its own response in a\r\n\r\nrational, positive, understanding manner, we  need\r\n\r\nhave  no  fear  about how the teachers  themselves\r\n\r\nwill respond to the challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in recent years the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  has wielded the big axe in implementing\r\n\r\nthe  restructuring  of  our education  system  and\r\n\r\nintroduction   of  new  teaching   methods.   Such\r\n\r\nmeasures  are not only necessary but also welcome.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because, unlike other fields,  education\r\n\r\ncannot  remain  as it has always been.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nteach new ideas with old methods. Teaching methods\r\n\r\nmust  be  formulated  to suit  the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and changing circumstances. Only in  this\r\n\r\nway  can  we bring forth a generation to meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the changing times in our country.  But\r\n\r\nthe  new  education  system now  being  vigorously\r\n\r\nimplemented  should also cater for  the  objective\r\n\r\nneed  for  adequate  school  buildings  and  other\r\n\r\nfacilities, in addition to good quality  teachers.\r\n\r\nOnly in this way can we achieve maximum results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, small schools in the rural areas have very\r\n\r\nlittle space. Their simple buildings are very  old\r\n\r\nand  dilapidated, and there is  a  total  lack  of\r\n\r\nfacilities.  In such circumstances, we  can  apply\r\n\r\nthe  saying  which goes, \"You may  have  the  best\r\n\r\ncook,   but   he  cannot  cook  without   adequate\r\n\r\ningredients.\"  I,  therefore, suggest  that  small\r\n\r\nschools  in  the rural areas should be amalgamated\r\n\r\ninto larger schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education should treat all\r\n\r\nschools alike and give the best possible financial\r\n\r\naid to all the amalga\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmated  schools. It is only through an amalgamation\r\n\r\nof  the small schools that we can ensure a certain\r\n\r\nstandard  of  facilities and school buildings  for\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas. It will then be in keeping  with\r\n\r\nthe implementation of the new education system. In\r\n\r\nthis way, every child in Singapore will be able to\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  opportunity of  a  good  education  in\r\n\r\nbetter equipped surroundings and school buildings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nbring  up  another matter, and that is in relation\r\n\r\nto  the  announcement of results of secondary  and\r\n\r\nhigher   secondary  school  examinations  in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  The  results of  the  Primary  School\r\n\r\nLeaving Examination are not normally published  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers. Notwithstanding this, cases  have\r\n\r\nbeen  known where unsuccessful PSLE students  have\r\n\r\nleft their homes or their families. The results of\r\n\r\nSecondary   IV  and  Pre-U  or  HSC  examinations,\r\n\r\nhowever,  are  announced in the newspapers.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult   of   such   public   announcement,   some\r\n\r\nunsuccessful   candidates   would    develop    an\r\n\r\ninferiority  complex  by not  seeing  their  names\r\n\r\ntogether with their classmates' in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nThey  feel that they are put in a very poor light,\r\n\r\nand  are more or less put to public shame,  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak.  In  such circumstances, those unsuccessful\r\n\r\ncandidates  who  do  not have a  strong  sense  of\r\n\r\nmorale  would simply lose face and would  even  do\r\n\r\nvery    foolish   things,   unpleasant   or   even\r\n\r\nunfortunate. This is regrettable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore suggest that we cease the\r\n\r\npublication  of examination results.  The  results\r\n\r\ncan  only  be  made known to all  the  candidates,\r\n\r\nincluding those from the Adult Education Board, by\r\n\r\nthe   school  authorities  or  the  AEB.   Private\r\n\r\ncandidates  can  be  directly  notified  of  their\r\n\r\nresults  through  the  post  by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.  There is, therefore, no apparent  need\r\n\r\nfor  the  results  of  these  examinations  to  be\r\n\r\npublished   in   the  newspapers,   because   such\r\n\r\nannouncement  may  cause an  unnecessary  blow  to\r\n\r\nunsuccessful candidates,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat   least   psychologically.  I  would  therefore\r\n\r\nsuggest   to   the  Ministry  of  Education   that\r\n\r\nhenceforth   results  of  the   secondary   school\r\n\r\nexaminations  should  not  be  published  in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  This practice should be abolished.  I\r\n\r\nwould,  however, concede that the  publication  of\r\n\r\nthe  results  of  very  outstanding  students  may\r\n\r\ncontinue,  because it will then give encouragement\r\n\r\nto our students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to touch on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of Chinese stream Secondary IV  students\r\n\r\nentering pre-U classes. In the case of the Chinese\r\n\r\nschools,  those  who  desire  to  continue   their\r\n\r\nstudies  in the upper secondary classes will  only\r\n\r\nbe allowed to join the classes after their results\r\n\r\nare  known,  so as to assess whether they  possess\r\n\r\nthe minimum standard of qualification specified by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education. So students wishing  to\r\n\r\njoin upper secondary classes have to wait for  two\r\n\r\nto   three  months.  And  this  year  because  the\r\n\r\nSecondary IV results were announced only in March,\r\n\r\nour  poor  students had to wait  for  nearly  four\r\n\r\nmonths  before they can enter the upper  secondary\r\n\r\nclasses to further their studies. We concede  that\r\n\r\nit takes considerable time to mark the examination\r\n\r\npapers.  But we must not forget that at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  Secondary IV students in the English  stream\r\n\r\nare allowed to join the upper secondary classes on\r\n\r\nthe  strength  of  the results of the  preliminary\r\n\r\nexaminations conducted by the schools.  And  after\r\n\r\nthe  official announcement of their results,  they\r\n\r\nmay  either  continue if their  results  meet  the\r\n\r\nentry  requirements specified by the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  or  drop out if they do not  meet  such\r\n\r\nrequirements. Since this is allowed in the English\r\n\r\nstream, I wonder why it cannot be allowed  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has always been saying that\r\n\r\nall  the  four  streams of education  are  treated\r\n\r\nequally. So how does one explain this discrepancy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment moved by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Katong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, education is the foundation for nation\r\n\r\nbuilding. In recent years,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  education  policy  has  laid  stress  on  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of mathematics, science and technology\r\n\r\nand   bi-lingualism  in  order  to  help  in   the\r\n\r\npromotion of nation building. But in doing so, the\r\n\r\ninculcation  of  character  building,  moral   and\r\n\r\nethical   concepts  in  the  students   has   been\r\n\r\nneglected  by  the Ministry of Education.  We  all\r\n\r\nknow that there is the subject called \"Ethics\"  or\r\n\r\n\"Civics\"  taught in many schools  but  it  is  not\r\n\r\nconsidered   as   a   subject   for   examination.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the students do not pay much  attention\r\n\r\nto  this subject and the teachers themselves  lack\r\n\r\ninterest  in  teaching it. In fact, some  of  them\r\n\r\neven   use  the  Ethics  period  to  teach   other\r\n\r\nsubjects.  As  a  result, the inculcation  of  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of moral virtues of the students has  not\r\n\r\nbeen effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not profit in adapting education to\r\n\r\nmeet  social  development and national  needs.  We\r\n\r\nshould not do it at the expense of inculcating the\r\n\r\nethical  concept  and character  building  in  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  If  a  person is brought  up  to  be  a\r\n\r\nspecialist  or  a  professor, but  is  lacking  in\r\n\r\nmorals, character or ethical concept, then of what\r\n\r\nuse is he to our society? So we should not try  to\r\n\r\neducate  our students into becoming robots without\r\n\r\na sense of morality and responsibility to society.\r\n\r\nTherefore, moral education is very important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore hope that the Minister will pay\r\n\r\nattention to this very important matter  and  make\r\n\r\nadjustments,  if necessary, to include  ethics  or\r\n\r\ncivics as one of the examination subjects, so that\r\n\r\nwe  can  bring  up a generation of  students  with\r\n\r\nmoral character and imbued with a sense of loyalty\r\n\r\nand  patriotism. Only then can the future  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry be assured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as expected the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation has attracted a large number of speakers\r\n\r\nin  this Budget debate. The reason is that in  the\r\n\r\nlast analysis education decides the performance of\r\n\r\nthe nation. A creditable performance of the nation\r\n\r\ndepends on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollective courage, determination, ability and the\r\n\r\nsocial  morality  of  the  people.  Thus  if   the\r\n\r\neducation of the State ensures that every  citizen\r\n\r\ndevelops  with these potentials, then collectively\r\n\r\nthe nation should perform successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the education system has been\r\n\r\nrestructured again, and this time we hope for some\r\n\r\nappreciable   period,  I   wish   to   make   some\r\n\r\nobservations on the restructuring as announced and\r\n\r\nthe implications arising from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, Sir, the problem of sufficient\r\n\r\nclasses  and  teachers comes to mind.  Though  the\r\n\r\nmajority   of  primary  school  pupils   will   be\r\n\r\ncompleting  the primary education in  seven  years\r\n\r\n(as  that  will  be the normal course  of  primary\r\n\r\neducation), the Minister has stated that about 40%\r\n\r\nof   primary  school  pupils  will  be  completing\r\n\r\nprimary education in six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as the Minister has announced, there will\r\n\r\nbe  in operation two sets of upper primary classes\r\n\r\nin  the  primary  schools. Now, if  you  take  the\r\n\r\nhypothetical case of a school having  two  Primary\r\n\r\nIII   classes   at  the  outset,  and   if   after\r\n\r\nassessment, eight pupils from the first class  and\r\n\r\n15 pupils from the second class, making 23 in all,\r\n\r\nare   found   suitable  for  six  years'   primary\r\n\r\neducation  and  the remaining 27 pupils  from  the\r\n\r\nfirst  class and 20 pupils from the second  class,\r\n\r\nmaking  47  in all, are found suitable  for  seven\r\n\r\nyears' primary education, then for Primary IV, you\r\n\r\nwill,  have one class of 23 pupils for six  years'\r\n\r\nprimary education and two classes for seven years'\r\n\r\nprimary  education  comprising  one  class  of  35\r\n\r\npupils  and another of 12 pupils (that is, if  you\r\n\r\napply  the ratio of 35 pupils to a class). If  the\r\n\r\nposition  rests  there, it means  that  after  the\r\n\r\nassessment one additional class is created and one\r\n\r\nadditional teacher is required. If adjustments are\r\n\r\nmade,  it  must  mean  transfers  of  pupils   and\r\n\r\nteachers  for  that  year. How  has  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nplanned    to   resolve   these   problems?    And\r\n\r\nincidentally, Sir, thinking aloud,  what  will  be\r\n\r\nthe  stand  of  the Singapore Teachers'  Union  on\r\n\r\nthese problems? But the important thing is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat parents must be satisfied that the results of\r\n\r\nthe  assessment  must not be manipulated  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  administrative  expediency   at   the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  the  true  academic  ability  of  the\r\n\r\npupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been announced that the decision of\r\n\r\nwhether a pupil should take six or seven years  to\r\n\r\ncomplete his primary education will be based on  a\r\n\r\n\"continual    assessment    of    his     academic\r\n\r\nperformance\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should think that the assessment itself should\r\n\r\nbe based on certain standard forms and criteria of\r\n\r\nevaluating the academic performance of the  pupil.\r\n\r\nIf not, the disparities in the evaluations between\r\n\r\ndifferent  schools applying individualistic  forms\r\n\r\nand criteria will not achieve a fair assessment of\r\n\r\nthe  pupils'  performances.  Have  the  forms  and\r\n\r\ncriteria of assessment been worked out? If not,  I\r\n\r\nimagine  they  will be worked out soon.  And  when\r\n\r\nthey are worked out, can they be applied fairly to\r\n\r\nassess the pupil's academic performance in Primary\r\n\r\nI  in  1973  and  Primary II  in  1974  when  this\r\n\r\ncontinual  assessment was then  not  contemplated?\r\n\r\nHow   and   to   what  extent  will  the   pupil's\r\n\r\nperformance  in the second language in  the  first\r\n\r\nthree years be decisive in determining whether the\r\n\r\npupil does primary education in six years or seven\r\n\r\nyears?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been announced that normal primary\r\n\r\neducation  will  be  seven  years  and  that   the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  primary pupils will  complete  their\r\n\r\neducation  in  seven years. But it has  also  been\r\n\r\nannounced,  as  I have pointed out  earlier,  that\r\n\r\nabout  40%  of  primary pupils will  complete  the\r\n\r\nprimary  education in six years.  This  cannot  be\r\n\r\nregarded as an exception. And although it has been\r\n\r\nannounced  that  corrective reassessment  will  be\r\n\r\nmade  at  the end of Primary IV, parents generally\r\n\r\nwill  regard the assessment at the end of  Primary\r\n\r\nIII  as crucial since they still see promise of  a\r\n\r\nbetter future for their children through the  OCE,\r\n\r\nthe HSC and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents will regard the assessment at the end of\r\n\r\nPrimary III as a more or less\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconclusive   determination  of  their   children's\r\n\r\nfuture,  that is, whether they are blue collar  or\r\n\r\nwhite  collar workers. This being so, they  expect\r\n\r\nthe  more  able  and experienced  teachers  to  be\r\n\r\nassigned to teach in Primary Is, IIs and IIIs. Nor\r\n\r\nshould these teachers be transferred before  three\r\n\r\nyears  at least. I am sure that no relief teachers\r\n\r\nwill be assigned to these classes in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the PSLE and beyond, the Minister has\r\n\r\nstated that the PSLE will be a grading exercise to\r\n\r\nchannel  pupils into different forms of  secondary\r\n\r\neducation and training. Apart from the \"0\" and \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevels  in  the academic, technical and commercial\r\n\r\nstreams,  there  will  be  a  variety  of  courses\r\n\r\ncombining   general   education   with   technical\r\n\r\ntraining  or  apprenticeship  scheme  plan  for  a\r\n\r\ncareer  in the industrial, commercial and  service\r\n\r\nsectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has announced that the restructured\r\n\r\nsystem  at  the  secondary level will  operate  in\r\n\r\n1979.  He has also announced that the restructured\r\n\r\nprocess  will begin with Primary III  pupils  this\r\n\r\nyear  and the 1975 batch of Primary IV pupils will\r\n\r\ncontinue but making only one other attempt for the\r\n\r\nPSLE. Thus in three years commencing in 1976 these\r\n\r\nprimary  pupils will be graded at the end of  1978\r\n\r\nfor the restructured system at the secondary level\r\n\r\nin  1979.  So  at the end of 1978  there  will  be\r\n\r\ngrading  of  PSLE  pupils to decide  whether  they\r\n\r\nshould do courses leading to the GCE or HSC or any\r\n\r\nof   the  other  courses  for  a  career  in   the\r\n\r\nindustrial,  commercial and service sectors.  Such\r\n\r\ngrading  must  be based on revised  upper  primary\r\n\r\ncurriculum to operate in 1976, that is, next year.\r\n\r\nCan  the  Minister at this stage give  an  outline\r\n\r\ndescription  of the other courses? When  will  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  for operation in 1976  be  ready  this\r\n\r\nyear and be made public?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised these queries in order that the\r\n\r\npublic  can  grasp  the system  fully,  since  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of children's education is always a matter\r\n\r\nof utmost concern to parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rodrigo, your ten minutes are up.

Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Education Ministry is a very\r\n\r\ninteresting  Ministry  as  far  as  Singapore   is\r\n\r\nconcerned. It seems to be undergoing changes every\r\n\r\nso  often that the result is chaos, confusion  and\r\n\r\npuzzlement to everyone. Even those in the Ministry\r\n\r\nare  confused as to what they are supposed to  do.\r\n\r\nWorse, in schools the policy changes so often that\r\n\r\nprincipals and staff do not know exactly  what  is\r\n\r\nreally  required. What is the future of  education\r\n\r\nin Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask whether these changes or restructuring\r\n\r\nare really necessary. Can we not implement them in\r\n\r\nstages   and  with  great  patience?  The   policy\r\n\r\ndirectives from the Education Ministry are  issued\r\n\r\nso  rapidly  that  before  one  directive  can  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out effectively a new one is  issued.  We\r\n\r\nseem  to  make  use of the present  generation  of\r\n\r\nstudents  and teachers as guinea pigs.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether this restructuring is  a  wise  move\r\n\r\nbecause  the  changes have been so rapid  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  able to see the results  until  the\r\n\r\nstudents leave the secondary schools. And by  that\r\n\r\ntime  probably they will not know what  hell  they\r\n\r\nhave  gone  through. Let us be a bit more  patient\r\n\r\nand give it a little more thought. I am not saying\r\n\r\nthat the changes are bad. I am not saying that the\r\n\r\npolicies  are  bad. The policy of bilingualism  is\r\n\r\nextremely  good.  It is necessary for  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsurvival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarry  on  by all means, but do so in stages.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  should  not  just issue  directives  and\r\n\r\ninstruct  the principals to put them into practice\r\n\r\novernight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that there are 125 vacancies for\r\n\r\nEnglish teachers in primary schools and 215 in the\r\n\r\nsecondary schools in the English stream as at  1st\r\n\r\nMarch, 1975. This gives a figure of 340, which,  I\r\n\r\nmust  say, is very high. To make matters worse,  I\r\n\r\nnotice there were 301 resignations within a period\r\n\r\nof  14  months. What is being done to  fill  these\r\n\r\nvacancies?  340  vacancies  are  being  filled  by\r\n\r\nrelief  teachers,  some of  whom  come  today  and\r\n\r\ndisappear tomorrow. They are not teachers  in  the\r\n\r\nreal  sense  of the word. They are merely  filling\r\n\r\nthe  gap. How can we have a good education  system\r\n\r\nif  340  vacancies are filled by relief  teachers?\r\n\r\nThis is a very sad state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the Institute of Education, formerly\r\n\r\nknown  as the Teachers' Training College, used  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  teachers  by  the  hundreds  and  produce\r\n\r\nteachers by the hundreds too. Unfortunately, after\r\n\r\nthe TTC was renamed the Institute of Education, it\r\n\r\nhas    become   another   white   elephant.   Many\r\n\r\naccommodation units in the former College  are  as\r\n\r\ngood   as   haunted.  Many  teachers   have   been\r\n\r\ntransferred or opted out. There are a few of  them\r\n\r\nleft.  To make matters worse, students who  intend\r\n\r\nto  take up teaching as a profession have to  pay.\r\n\r\nNow,  give us the answer in one breath who  really\r\n\r\nwants  to  become a teacher today,  with  all  the\r\n\r\nheadaches  and pressure of work? The stresses  and\r\n\r\nstrains  are not really worth the money  they  get\r\n\r\nfor their training. Even the courses organised  by\r\n\r\nthe Institute of Education have to be paid for  by\r\n\r\nthe teachers. No wonder we have 340 vacancies! 301\r\n\r\nresignations  had  taken place  in  the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears. What has been done to recruit more teachers\r\n\r\nto  fill  the vacancies? 340 vacancies  means  340\r\n\r\nteachers less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I at this stage ask what is the purpose of\r\n\r\nthe  Education Fund? A lot of money  is  collected\r\n\r\nfrom  the foreign students studying in schools  or\r\n\r\ncolleges in Singapore. If these funds are used\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the good of the Singapore citizens, then I say\r\n\r\nthe  fund has its purpose. Unfortunately I do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  why a large sum of money is  collected\r\n\r\nfrom  students who study in private or  commercial\r\n\r\nschools.  These  private schools are  not  in  the\r\n\r\nleast  subsidised. Yet any student  who  wants  to\r\n\r\ngain  entry into these private schools has to  pay\r\n\r\nto  the  Education Fund before he  is  allowed  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  his  studies. I feel this  is  ethically\r\n\r\nwrong. We do not subsidise private schools. Why do\r\n\r\nwe collect money from students who are studying in\r\n\r\nprivate schools? If it is the case with Government\r\n\r\nschools, it is understandable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that some school children are\r\n\r\ngiven  fund  raising cards for  donations  to  the\r\n\r\nschool fund just before the school holidays.  They\r\n\r\nare  instructed  to collect as much  as  possible.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  school reopens these cards  are  handed\r\n\r\nback  to the teachers. Some children who have  not\r\n\r\ncollected the targeted amount are given  back  the\r\n\r\ncards and instructed to continue to collect up  to\r\n\r\nthe  required amount. I wonder why these  students\r\n\r\nare  asked  to  collect up to a  certain  expected\r\n\r\namount.  This  might  induce the  children  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething irregular for fear of being harassed  by\r\n\r\nthe teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point let me ask why GCE \"A\" level in\r\n\r\nCommerce course is not allowed to be conducted  in\r\n\r\nprivate  schools. This course is only  done  in  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  school.  There  are  certain   schools\r\n\r\ncapable  of conducting such a course, and  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  some of them may produce better results than\r\n\r\nthe Government schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, on the subject of courses, let me\r\n\r\nalso  ask why is a restriction imposed on teachers\r\n\r\nwho  wish to do a course on their own? To give  an\r\n\r\nexample, if a teacher in the academic stream wants\r\n\r\nto  do  a technical course, permission is refused.\r\n\r\nThe  result is that the teacher is frustrated. Why\r\n\r\nmust  we restrict teachers who are keen to improve\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  who will be  of  benefit  to  our\r\n\r\neducation system later on?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how far has the posting of teachers and'\r\n\r\nstudents nearest their homes been carried  out?  I\r\n\r\nstill  notice that a great number of teachers  and\r\n\r\nstudents are put in~ schools quite a distance away\r\n\r\nfrom  their homes. Can the Minister look into  the\r\n\r\nmatter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will I would like to know when results\r\n\r\nof  the recent teachers exercise be known? I  hope\r\n\r\ngreater  number  of  them will  be,  thus  causing\r\n\r\nlesser dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nTeachers  are  very  important  in  education   of\r\n\r\nchildren. Their importance is next to the parents.\r\n\r\nIf  the  teachers not properly educated, they  not\r\n\r\nproduce  good  students. If the re  well  educated\r\n\r\nthey will be of benefit to the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the sixth under this\r\n\r\nsubhead  I am somewhat at a disadvantage  for  the\r\n\r\nsimple  reason that whatever I want to  been  very\r\n\r\neloquently  and put across by hon. Members  spoken\r\n\r\nbefore me. But I feel nonetheless say something on\r\n\r\nthis restructured education scheme because it  has\r\n\r\naroused considerable interest both from within and\r\n\r\nis House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that, of all the changes in the\r\n\r\neducational  policy  that have  taken  place  past\r\n\r\ndecade  or  so,  the  recent have  been  the  most\r\n\r\nsensible  they are oriented towards the well-being\r\n\r\nand  interest; unlike previous changes which  were\r\n\r\ntailored  the political, social, economic manpower\r\n\r\nobjectives. The recent are not geared to meet such\r\n\r\nobjectives but more to cater to the well-the child\r\n\r\nin school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two features of these changes demonstrate this.\r\n\r\nOne  is  that  schooling has been extended  to  11\r\n\r\nyears in both primary and secondary levels instead\r\n\r\nof 10 years. In fact, all of us in this House were\r\n\r\nbrought up under the 11-year education system.  It\r\n\r\nwas only a decade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  so  ago that the 11-year education system  was\r\n\r\nreduced  to 10 years, and I suspect that  at  that\r\n\r\ntime  the  reason for the reduction of one  year's\r\n\r\nschooling  was  purely  economic:  the  Government\r\n\r\nwanted  to save money. I could see no other reason\r\n\r\nfor the reduction of schooling from 11 to 10 years\r\n\r\nexcept  this economic reason. And the  price  paid\r\n\r\nfor  that  reduction was that  children  were  put\r\n\r\nunder  heavier  pressure to cope  with  a  certain\r\n\r\namount of knowledge to be acquired both in primary\r\n\r\nand secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members will know, in recent years because of\r\n\r\neconomic    and   political   developments,    new\r\n\r\nrequirements  have  come into  the  picture.  More\r\n\r\nobjectives  are pumped into the education  system,\r\n\r\nand  more  knowledge for the children to  acquire.\r\n\r\nEven  under the old system, where there  had  been\r\n\r\nmany subjects for children to learn, 11 years were\r\n\r\nconsidered  a  desirable period for completion  of\r\n\r\nthe  primary  and secondary education;  what  more\r\n\r\nthen  if  they have got more to learn now?  It  is\r\n\r\nonly  logical  to conclude that a  10-year  period\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  a desirable period.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why in the past few years there have  been\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from  parents particularly  about  the\r\n\r\npressure put on their children in the schools.  So\r\n\r\nan extension of another year helps to relieve that\r\n\r\npressure. This feature in itself demonstrates that\r\n\r\nthis is for the good of the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second feature of the recent restructured\r\n\r\neducation scheme is the removal of the Primary  VI\r\n\r\nentrance   examination  (PSLE)  as  a   means   to\r\n\r\ndetermine  whether  a  child could  continue  with\r\n\r\nsecondary education. I think many of us have heard\r\n\r\nof  complaints and are quite aware of this problem\r\n\r\nof  examination phobia, where everything is geared\r\n\r\ntowards  examination. A child is measured  by  the\r\n\r\nexamination  results.  The  system   is   a   very\r\n\r\nimperfect one. A child is condemned for life if he\r\n\r\nfails  his  Primary VI entrance  examination.  Any\r\n\r\nteacher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  know  that passing or failing this  entrance\r\n\r\nexamination   is   no   foolproof   criterion   in\r\n\r\ndetermining   whether  a  child  is   capable   of\r\n\r\ncontinuing  his  education or not.  Not  only  was\r\n\r\nthere  anxiety on the part of parents and children\r\n\r\nover  this  entrance examination in  the  previous\r\n\r\nsystem  which caused a lot of cramming of  studies\r\n\r\nand  private tuition but it also made schooling  a\r\n\r\nvery  unpleasant experience for the  children.  By\r\n\r\nremoving this requirement, education should become\r\n\r\nan interesting experience in school. Therefore, we\r\n\r\nhave  removed  a feature which condemns  a  child,\r\n\r\nrightly  or wrongly, by denying him an opportunity\r\n\r\nto  continue  with  his  education  after  primary\r\n\r\nschool  if  he  fails  his  primary  six  entrance\r\n\r\nexamination.  With  this  restructured   education\r\n\r\nsystem  an  examination is  no  longer  needed  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  whether a child should  or  should  not\r\n\r\nproceed  to  secondary school.  I  think  this  is\r\n\r\nextremely  desirable and in the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There exists a prejudice against blue-collar work\r\n\r\nand a preference for white-collar work. The result\r\n\r\nis  that  certain  prejudices are created  against\r\n\r\ncertain types of jobs. Recent developments in  our\r\n\r\ncountry  as an independent nation, where  we  have\r\n\r\ndeveloped into a modern society, have given us the\r\n\r\nopportunity to reflect that no matter what sort of\r\n\r\njob  a  person performs he has a role to play  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  an  importance to it,  irrespective  of\r\n\r\nwhether it is a white-collar or a blue-collar job.\r\n\r\nEverybody  has  a  role  to  play.  We  must  have\r\n\r\ndoctors,  lawyers,  clerks, teachers,  blue-collar\r\n\r\nworkers,  etc.  We must encourage parents  not  to\r\n\r\nshow   any  prejudice  against  certain  jobs   in\r\n\r\npreference for others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this restructured system, which caters for\r\n\r\nthe  children's future secondary education in  the\r\n\r\naptitude  they  are most suited  for,  either  for\r\n\r\nacademically-inclined  subjects  leading  to   the\r\n\r\nuniversity,   or   technically-inclined   subjects\r\n\r\nleading to polytechnic, or craft-inclined subjects\r\n\r\nleading to vocational training, we will ultimately\r\n\r\nhave a well balanced all round development of  our\r\n\r\nmanpower  resources  in  terms  of  the  different\r\n\r\nstrata\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  our whole manpower requirements. We will  have\r\n\r\nskilled  and trained people in all strata  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from all these desirable features, one\r\n\r\ncan  hardly  find  fault with  the  rationale  and\r\n\r\nobjective behind these changes. So it must be  the\r\n\r\nconcern of everybody - Ministry officials, Members\r\n\r\nof  Parliament, members of the public, parents and\r\n\r\nteachers  -  to give all their support  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat these objectives are attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, however, express my reservation at this\r\n\r\njuncture  as to whether the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nis  able  to  gear itself to meet these challenges\r\n\r\nahead. Judging from past experience, I think  they\r\n\r\nhave  not  got a commendable record  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nperformance to give us the kind of confidence. But\r\n\r\nwe  must not give up hope simply because too  much\r\n\r\nis  at stake. Perhaps we give them a chance and we\r\n\r\nwill do what we can to see how we can help them to\r\n\r\nachieve this objective. So if I appear to be  very\r\n\r\nmuch  in  favour of these changes,  that  has  got\r\n\r\nnothing  to do with the fact that I like the  very\r\n\r\ncharming smile of the Education Minister. They are\r\n\r\ncertainly very desirable objectives which  all  of\r\n\r\nus must assist to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Katong has brought up some\r\n\r\nvery    interesting   points   as   regards    the\r\n\r\nrequirements and demands of teachers, training and\r\n\r\nretraining  facilities, etc. I  therefore  do  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  repeat what he has said, except  to  say\r\n\r\nthat I completely agree with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those remarks, Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink  I  have  had my say although it  was  quite\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  me  not to repeat  certain  points\r\n\r\nwhich have already been raised by other Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, after seeing the list of six speakers ahead\r\n\r\nof  me, and practically all of them touched on the\r\n\r\nrestructured education system, I thought  I  would\r\n\r\nask  you  to appeal to the Minister once again  to\r\n\r\nanswer the questions raised first, before I speak.\r\n\r\nBut  having heard the hon. Member for Moulmein who\r\n\r\nso ably assisted the Minister in the first half of\r\n\r\nthe debate, I would carry on with some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  issues, not necessarily on the restructured\r\n\r\neducation system. I think my mind has been put  at\r\n\r\nease   in  respect  of  certain  matters  on   the\r\n\r\nrestructured education system, not by the Minister\r\n\r\nas yet but by the hon. Member for Moulmein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not going to touch on the restructured\r\n\r\neducation system. My intention is to talk  on  our\r\n\r\neducation policy in respect of the teaching of the\r\n\r\nsecond  language  in our schools  and  the  relief\r\n\r\nteachers, which point has somewhat been tackled by\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member for Anson. There is a great  deal\r\n\r\nof dissatisfaction amongst parents and teachers in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the teaching of Tamil  and  Malay  as\r\n\r\nsecond languages in our schools. The complaint  is\r\n\r\nthat there are many English schools and integrated\r\n\r\nprimary  schools where Malay and Tamil pupils  are\r\n\r\ngrouped   together  permanently  in   one   class,\r\n\r\nirrespective of educational achievements. This  is\r\n\r\njust  to  make it convenient to teach  the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage and also to ease administrative problems.\r\n\r\nIt  is  claimed  that  many schools  perhaps  have\r\n\r\ngrouped  their  pupils according to  their  second\r\n\r\nlanguage   choice  in  order  to  facilitate   the\r\n\r\narrangement  of  time-tables. No consideration  at\r\n\r\nall  is given to their second language ability nor\r\n\r\ntheir first language performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been informed that all Tamil and Malay\r\n\r\npupils  in the Selegie Integrated Primary  School,\r\n\r\nTelok  Kurau Primary School and Whitley  Secondary\r\n\r\nSchool have been put in one class permanently  for\r\n\r\nthis  year.  Is it also true that in  the  Selegie\r\n\r\nIntegrated  Primary School, one class of  English-medium pupils are all Indians? Will not the system\r\n\r\nof  segregation work contrary to the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  of maintaining a multiracial character  in\r\n\r\nthe  schools?  Will  not  this  defeat  the  whole\r\n\r\nmeaning and spirit of the school's pledge and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's effort to bring about a  mingling  of\r\n\r\nall  races  in the school classrooms  as  well  as\r\n\r\nschool playing fields?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been pointed out that the teaching of\r\n\r\nTamil  in  many mission primary schools  has  been\r\n\r\ndropped completely. If pupils in mission primary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools   offered  to  take  Tamil  as  a   second\r\n\r\nlanguage, what provisions are being made?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better known old and well established secondary\r\n\r\nschools like Gan Eng Seng School, Beatty Secondary\r\n\r\nSchool  and  Bartley Secondary School, which  were\r\n\r\ncentres   for  teaching  of  Tamil  as  a   second\r\n\r\nlanguage, have been closed down. These centres,  I\r\n\r\nhave been told, were the oldest in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, there are many teachers who have\r\n\r\nattained the required qualifications in Tamil  and\r\n\r\nMalay  to be recruited as Tamil and Malay Language\r\n\r\nteachers, and yet English-medium teachers who have\r\n\r\nobtained  a credit or a distinction in the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage  have been asked to teach Malay or  Tamil\r\n\r\nas a second language. Why is this being done?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that the Institute of Education has\r\n\r\nstopped   training   Malay  and   Tamil   Language\r\n\r\nteachers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as early as 1969, six years ago, I objected\r\n\r\nto  the  employment  of  relief  teachers  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education. In Hansard [Vol. 28,  col.\r\n\r\n639],  I queried the necessity of employing  large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of daily-rated relief teachers  for  long\r\n\r\nperiods.  In answer to the many questions  raised,\r\n\r\namong  other  things, the Minister for  Education,\r\n\r\nwho  was then the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education, replied as follows. Let me\r\n\r\nquote him [Vol. 28, col. 937]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The work of the relief teachers is under constant\r\n\r\nreview by the principals who make reports on their\r\n\r\nperformances.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  was in 1969. Sir, again in 1971, on the same\r\n\r\nquestion of relief teachers [Vol. 30, col. 539], I\r\n\r\nasked the then Minister of State, now the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.what concrete steps are being taken to do\r\n\r\naway  with  the  method  of employing  unqualified\r\n\r\nrelief  teachers to man our schools in such  large\r\n\r\nnumbers.?.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He answered and I quote him:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`..we cannot do away entirely with relief\r\n\r\nteachers.  .  .  , they are employed  in  a  great\r\n\r\nvariety of situations such as maternity leave  and\r\n\r\nso on. The pure vacancies will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfilled  when graduates come out from the Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining College.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  answer  to queries raised by other Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House, on the same topics, he also  told  us\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.the programme of training of relief teachers\r\n\r\nwill  be  carried  out under the whole  review  of\r\n\r\nteacher training.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>When  the  Member for Moulmein asked to  introduce\r\n\r\npart-time  training  as  a  way  to  minimise  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  having  to employ  large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nrelief  teachers to meet the shortages of teachers\r\n\r\nin schools, he again affirmed that he was carrying\r\n\r\nout  an  overall review of teacher training.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  was  1969 and 1971. This is 1975.  What  has\r\n\r\nhappened?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17th March, in answer to questions raised in\r\n\r\nParliament,     the    Parliamentary     Secretary\r\n\r\n(Education)  told us that 383 relief teachers  are\r\n\r\nemployed to fill the regular vacancies in addition\r\n\r\nto  175  relief teachers employed to  fill  casual\r\n\r\nvacancies arising from regular teachers being away\r\n\r\non  various forms of leave. In other words, 175 of\r\n\r\nthem are relief teachers in respect of people  who\r\n\r\nare  away  from  their jobs and 383  of  them  are\r\n\r\nfilling  pure vacancies, the pure vacancies  which\r\n\r\nthe Minister promised to fill as early as 1971.  I\r\n\r\nam   just   wondering  if  there  are  any   other\r\n\r\nprofessions  in the world where they have  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation.  Sir,  can  you imagine  our  hospitals\r\n\r\nmanned  by  unqualified relief  nurses  dispensing\r\n\r\nmedicine and giving injections. Worse still,  Sir,\r\n\r\ncan   you   imagine  unqualified   relief   nurses\r\n\r\nassisting  you  in an operating theatre.  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nunqualified people dispense medicine we call  them\r\n\r\nquacks.  If unqualified people tried to  interpret\r\n\r\nlaws  we call them \"lawyer burok\". What do we call\r\n\r\nunqualified teachers trying to teach?  Perhaps  we\r\n\r\nhave  got to think of a suitable nomenclature.  If\r\n\r\nwe   allow  this  situation  to  continue  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education, I am sure the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth - fortunately for us he is not here  -  may\r\n\r\nalso  introduce  such  a  system  to  relieve  the\r\n\r\nshortage of staff in the hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry of Education, there are more than\r\n\r\n10,000 teachers. There certainly would be a number\r\n\r\nof teachers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   various   forms  of  leave  at   all   times.\r\n\r\nApparently, at the moment, 175 of them are away on\r\n\r\none  form of leave or the other. To relieve  them,\r\n\r\nwhat  we need is a pool of qualified teachers  who\r\n\r\ncan  be utilised to do relief work instead of  the\r\n\r\npresent  system  of appointing unqualified  relief\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When can we expect our children to be taught by\r\n\r\nqualified  people  and not by  unqualified  relief\r\n\r\nteachers who come and go as they please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I first explain that\r\n\r\nas  one of the office-bearers in a teachers' union\r\n\r\nI  am  naturally  more concerned with  educational\r\n\r\nproblems. Although I am placed last on the list of\r\n\r\nspeakers in regard lo this item, I would now  like\r\n\r\nto  discuss  in  general some of  our  educational\r\n\r\nproblems.  As  far as I can, I  will  try  not  to\r\n\r\nrepeat what has been raised by my colleagues.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  problem  is  the restructuring  of  primary\r\n\r\nschool  education. First of all, may I express  my\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  concept that  in  any  education\r\n\r\nsystem  the  content of education in  one  set  of\r\n\r\nconditions  may  not  suit  a  different  set   of\r\n\r\nconditions. For this reason not only do I  support\r\n\r\nthe  restructuring of primary education but I also\r\n\r\nfully  praise the bold move taken by the Minister.\r\n\r\nHowever, to be successful any restructuring  of  a\r\n\r\nsystem  must be preceded by detailed and  thorough\r\n\r\nplanning.  What is most important is to understand\r\n\r\nthoroughly the old problems and shortcomings,  the\r\n\r\nlikely  problems that will be encountered  in  the\r\n\r\nnew  system and the likely solutions. Sir, the new\r\n\r\nsystem will undoubtedly stimulate greater interest\r\n\r\namong   students  at  different  levels  so   that\r\n\r\nschooling  will not be regarded as a burden.  This\r\n\r\nis   good  because  our  society  being  practical\r\n\r\nattaches great importance to examination results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the theory of education is impressive,\r\n\r\nparents  do not view it this way. In the past  the\r\n\r\nresults  of  the PSLE affected the  reputation  of\r\n\r\nparents, schools and also the students. But now we\r\n\r\nare going to conduct an exercise among Primary III\r\n\r\nstudents to determine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  they  should  do another  three  or  four\r\n\r\nyears.  Will  this  not cause the  burden  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents to be advanced earlier?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now actively promoting bilingualism. But\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  circular  on  Primary   School\r\n\r\nrestructuring,  those who are not well  versed  in\r\n\r\ntwo  languages are allowed to have reduced periods\r\n\r\nfor  the second language. However, when they  take\r\n\r\nthe  PSLE they are still required to sit  for  the\r\n\r\nsecond  language  in  the same examination.  Thus,\r\n\r\nsome problems will arise. First, how do we measure\r\n\r\nthe  term \"well versed\"? Second, can those who are\r\n\r\nless  well  versed be made more  well  versed?  If\r\n\r\nthese  students  have to sit for the  same  second\r\n\r\nlanguage paper in the PSLE, then do we expect them\r\n\r\nto  do  well in the examination if they are  given\r\n\r\nless  time? Moreover, if they do well in the other\r\n\r\npapers too and carry on their studies in secondary\r\n\r\nschools, vocational or technical institutes,  will\r\n\r\nthey  not have to use the second language as well?\r\n\r\nThere  is  an  obvious inconsistency  here.  If  a\r\n\r\nstudent  is not proficient in the second language,\r\n\r\nremedial  measures  should be taken  as  early  as\r\n\r\npossible.   According   to   linguistic   experts,\r\n\r\nchildren learn languages faster than adults. Since\r\n\r\nwe want to promote bilingualism, our policy should\r\n\r\nbe  thorough and not biased. And very soon, at the\r\n\r\nend  of the year, the assessment will be made  for\r\n\r\nthe  first batch of Primary III students. Have all\r\n\r\nthe  schools  been  notified of the  criteria  for\r\n\r\nassessment? If I am not mistaken, the first  batch\r\n\r\nof  July intake will complete their Primary III in\r\n\r\nJune this year. Will they also be affected by this\r\n\r\nnew education policy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem I would like to discuss is the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  teachers in charge of the  uniformed\r\n\r\ngroups.  The policy of extra-curricular activities\r\n\r\ninitiated  by the Ministry of Education  has  been\r\n\r\nwell supported by all schools, as can be witnessed\r\n\r\nby  the  good  support and turn-out at  the  Youth\r\n\r\nFestivals.  Certain changes will be  made  to  the\r\n\r\nYouth  Festival  programme  this  year;  its  main\r\n\r\nobjective is to reduce the burden on the  schools.\r\n\r\nMany teachers and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents welcome this move. They can heave a  sigh\r\n\r\nof  relief now because their lessons will  not  be\r\n\r\nunduly  affected as there have been far  too  many\r\n\r\nextra  curricular  activities.  However,  recently\r\n\r\ncertain  officers  responsible for  the  uniformed\r\n\r\ngroups  have  asked teachers in  charge  of  these\r\n\r\ngroups  at  the  second or third  week  after  the\r\n\r\nopening  of  the  school term to  go  for  in-camp\r\n\r\ntraining  for  two or three weeks. Some  of  those\r\n\r\nteachers   who   go  for  in-camp   training   are\r\n\r\nsubstituted by relief teachers but others are not.\r\n\r\nBy  the time the relief teachers report for  duty,\r\n\r\nthe   teachers  are  due  to  return  from   their\r\n\r\ntraining.   In  fact,  the  commandants   of   the\r\n\r\nuniformed  groups should realise that calling  the\r\n\r\nteachers   away  from  their  normal  duties   for\r\n\r\ntraining   will  affect  both  the  teachers   and\r\n\r\nstudents.  These officers should be familiar  with\r\n\r\nthe  school terms, the administrative problems  of\r\n\r\nthe schools, and should not regard school hours as\r\n\r\nholidays, or pay attention only to their own work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints that some\r\n\r\nteachers who are in charge of uniformed groups  as\r\n\r\nwell  as school administration have been asked  to\r\n\r\ngo  to  another  school at short  notice  to  take\r\n\r\ncharge  of  uniformed groups there.  I  think  due\r\n\r\nattention  should be paid to the fact  that  these\r\n\r\nteachers  are more urgently required to carry  out\r\n\r\nthe  administrative duties in their  own  schools.\r\n\r\nBut I understand that some of the commandants have\r\n\r\ngiven   warnings   to  these  teachers   regarding\r\n\r\ntransfers  that if they do not follow instructions\r\n\r\nthen  they will be removed. I do not know  whether\r\n\r\nthese officers realise that teachers are first and\r\n\r\nforemost  teachers. These teachers participate  in\r\n\r\nuniformed group activities only because of  extra-curricular activities. They should not be regarded\r\n\r\nfirst  and  foremost  as  teachers  in  charge  of\r\n\r\nuniformed  groups  or part-time  teachers.  Extra-curricular activities are not their full-time job.\r\n\r\nOne  must realise that teachers in charge of these\r\n\r\ngroups  have to do more work and spend more  time,\r\n\r\nand there is no extra benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnnecessary restrictions and warnings are uncalled\r\n\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the third question. Recently some\r\n\r\nschools  have  received  certain  instruments  and\r\n\r\nequipment  as  presents from Intraco  through  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education. According to them  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  gifts are somewhat outdated and do not  serve\r\n\r\nmuch  purpose. I do not know whether  or  not  the\r\n\r\nallocation or distribution of these items has been\r\n\r\nbased  on  the  requisitions applied  for  by  the\r\n\r\nschools. If so, it would be better to allot  funds\r\n\r\nto the schools to acquire their own instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth problem I would like to touch upon is\r\n\r\nin  regard to the welfare o, retired teachers.  By\r\n\r\nthe  keen  efforts  of the teachers'  unions,  the\r\n\r\nauthorities concerned have allowed members of  the\r\n\r\nfamily  of  a  teacher to similarly enjoy  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits.  But when he retires, he must  surrender\r\n\r\nall medical benefits cards. Thus he and his family\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  able  to  enjoy  any  more  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits. According to medical science, the  older\r\n\r\na  person gets, the more likely he will get  sick.\r\n\r\nThe body is just like a machine, which breaks down\r\n\r\nmore  often as it gets older. Therefore, when  the\r\n\r\nteacher  retires, he needs more medical care.  But\r\n\r\ninstead  we are depriving him of medical  benefits\r\n\r\nat the time when he is also going to lose his job.\r\n\r\nThis  \"double-barrelled\" attack  will  affect  him\r\n\r\ndrastically. However, I am glad to note  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance  is granting  higher  earned\r\n\r\nincome tax relief to those who continue employment\r\n\r\nabove  55 years of age. This is good and it  is  a\r\n\r\npractical  move  that expresses  the  Government's\r\n\r\ncare  for  the  aged, it is a virtue  to  pay  due\r\n\r\nrespect to the old. But people who are old have  a\r\n\r\ngreater  need for medical attention. I  hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  and the department  concerned  will\r\n\r\nseriously  consider  granting  continued   medical\r\n\r\nbenefits to teachers who retire because they  have\r\n\r\nsacrificed  their whole life for the education  of\r\n\r\nour children and now is the time that they deserve\r\n\r\nsome warmth from the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth problem that I would like to touch upon\r\n\r\nis  the question of allowance for principals. Sir,\r\n\r\nall  of  us realise school principals have a  very\r\n\r\ngreat responsibility. Their workload is very heavy\r\n\r\nand  they have to tackle many problems, both great\r\n\r\nand  small.  In the past, they had the consolation\r\n\r\nof  a post allowance which was used to offset  the\r\n\r\nentertainment expenses which they could not  avoid\r\n\r\nin  the  course  of their duties.  However,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the revision of salary scales, the  post\r\n\r\nallowance   of   principals   was   abolished.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the  Ministry  of  Education  is\r\n\r\nfinding   it  more  difficult  nowadays   to   get\r\n\r\nprincipals.  Even in the Ministry of  Education  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  was carried out inviting applications  for\r\n\r\nthe  post of principal, but the response has  been\r\n\r\nvery  poor.  Therefore I hope  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nconsider   restoring   the   post   allowance   to\r\n\r\nprincipals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, your time is up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, can I have one more minute?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You can always come back to it after the Minister\r\n\r\nhas replied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I am not an education expert as previous hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  who  spoke. But may I  humbly  seek  your\r\n\r\napproval   to   make  a  few   comments   on   the\r\n\r\nrestructuring of the education system. I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthat   the  Hon.  Minister  is  well  aware   that\r\n\r\nstreaming   children  in  schools   according   to\r\n\r\nestimated  ability is damaging to the  educational\r\n\r\ninterests  of children categorised as  less  able,\r\n\r\nand   irrelevant   to   the  interest   of   those\r\n\r\ncategorised as more able. In effect, the  practice\r\n\r\nof    streaming    tends   to   reinforce    other\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory  aspects of the educational  system\r\n\r\nto  the  disadvantage of many children from manual\r\n\r\nworkers' homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructuring of the education system will\r\n\r\nalso  pose  problems. As I see it, there  will  be\r\n\r\nproblems for the teachers and principals who  will\r\n\r\nhave added responsibilities and added burdens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin making assessments to stream children after the\r\n\r\ncompletion of Primary III. Will these teachers and\r\n\r\nprincipals  be  able to make correct  assessments?\r\n\r\nThey will need to be trained to ensure that proper\r\n\r\nassessments  are made. Then again  these  teachers\r\n\r\nand principals will be conscience-pricked if wrong\r\n\r\nassessments are made. This, I believe, is a  grave\r\n\r\nresponsibility to shoulder teachers and principals\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are problems that parents would be\r\n\r\nfaced with. Even if parents are told over and over\r\n\r\nagain  the  dire  consequences  of  pushing  their\r\n\r\nchildren too hard, the restructuring will catalyse\r\n\r\nan  even greater pushing, much to the detriment of\r\n\r\nthe  children.  Parents believe  they  know  their\r\n\r\nchildren's  capabilities too well  and  too  often\r\n\r\ndemand  too much from them. This could damage  not\r\n\r\nonly children who are less able but also those who\r\n\r\nare more able.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private tuition will also be introduced into\r\n\r\nhomes  to  children as early as  when  they  first\r\n\r\nstart schooling. This will, of course, unduly fray\r\n\r\nthe pockets of some parents and prohibit those who\r\n\r\ncannot  afford giving their children  private  tui\r\n\r\ntion.  The  pace  of  the rat race  has  now  been\r\n\r\nincreased  and  the  flag-off  advanced  by   this\r\n\r\nrestructuring proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, as a simple-minded parent with school-going\r\n\r\nchildren, I have often felt rather confused  about\r\n\r\nthe   direction  of  our  education  system,   and\r\n\r\nlistening to my learned colleagues here  today,  I\r\n\r\nmust   profess  that  I  am  becoming  even   more\r\n\r\nconfused.  I do not know anything about education,\r\n\r\nleast of all education policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is not so much a question of whether a\r\n\r\npolicy  is right or a policy is wrong. As  far  as\r\n\r\npolicies  are  concerned, I am quite  prepared  to\r\n\r\nleave  it  in the very capable hands of  our  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister.  But  I think it is more a  question  of\r\n\r\nimplementation  and we should look  into  it  more\r\n\r\nclosely.  Many  of our policies have  started  off\r\n\r\nwith a big bang. It sounds good on paper and it is\r\n\r\nvery difficult for a layman to quarrel whether  it\r\n\r\nis good or bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the restructuring of our primary\r\n\r\neducation, which instead of six years we now  have\r\n\r\nseven  years,  I am just wondering what  is  wrong\r\n\r\nwith six years. We have all gone through six years\r\n\r\nof  primary education, and during our time we  did\r\n\r\nnot  even have kindergarten experience. So we  can\r\n\r\nsay  that today the primary education is  not  six\r\n\r\nbut  eight years, if we count the two years  spent\r\n\r\nin kindergarten. In fact, we are now going to have\r\n\r\nnine  years' primary education. Anyway, as I said,\r\n\r\nI am not going to quarrel with that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem really is implementation. How do\r\n\r\nwe go about it, and is the policy formulated being\r\n\r\nunderstood  both by the officers in  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nand   the  teachers  themselves?  In  fact,   many\r\n\r\nteachers  have told me that they are  so  confused\r\n\r\nwith all the chopping and changing. I do not blame\r\n\r\nthem.  I  think this is really a matter  which  we\r\n\r\nshould  look  into very closely. We can  argue  on\r\n\r\npolicy  with a great number of learned  colleagues\r\n\r\nhere, who are all professional teachers. We can go\r\n\r\non  and  on arguing as to who is right and who  is\r\n\r\nwrong.  Well, the test of the pudding  is  in  the\r\n\r\neating. It is too early to say. So I think it is a\r\n\r\nwaste of time and waste of breath. I can only urge\r\n\r\nthe  Hon.  Minister,  as a  parent:  \"Please,  for\r\n\r\ngoodness sake, whatever you are going to do,  look\r\n\r\ninto  it very closely.\" And in its implementation,\r\n\r\nhas he got the manpower, and whether the staff and\r\n\r\nteachers understand what is going on?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I like to be down to earth about this\r\n\r\nmatter.  As  I  say, I do not know anything  about\r\n\r\neducation. But this is causing general frustration\r\n\r\namong   parents.  I  must  give  credit   to   our\r\n\r\nyoungsters  as many of them do not suffer  nervous\r\n\r\nbreakdowns.  I  have seen many  cases  of  parents\r\n\r\nsuffering  from  examination  jitters.  Each  time\r\n\r\nthere is a change of syllabus, or a change in  the\r\n\r\npolicy, it is the parents who suffer. Poor thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have said enough, and thank you\r\n\r\nfor giving me this opportunity to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the few Members who have spoken have covered\r\n\r\na  very  wide spectrum on the issue of  education.\r\n\r\nGenerally,  the  points raised fall  into  several\r\n\r\ncategories  and I propose to deal with them  under\r\n\r\nthese categories - changes in the education system\r\n\r\nand restructuring, professional matters concerning\r\n\r\nteachers, school management, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, on the restructuring of the\r\n\r\neducation  system, may I compliment those  Members\r\n\r\nwho  have  spoken for their in-depth knowledge  of\r\n\r\nwhat is being done, in particular, the Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein  who spoke very eloquently in defence  of\r\n\r\nthe  changes.  Let mc assure all Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse that this proposed change is not an exercise\r\n\r\non paper and it will not, as the Member for Katong\r\n\r\nhas  said,  start  with a  bang  and  end  with  a\r\n\r\nwhimper. I agree that superficially there  appears\r\n\r\nto  have  been  a  lot  of changes  and  at  times\r\n\r\nconfusing, as the Member for Jalan Kayu has  said.\r\n\r\nAll  these  changes  over  the  recent  years  are\r\n\r\nactually  the logical development of our education\r\n\r\nsystem  over the last one and a half decades.  Our\r\n\r\neducation  policy has been spelt out very  clearly\r\n\r\nin  our  1959 documents. All these changes are  no\r\n\r\nother  than  logical developments of this  policy.\r\n\r\nWhy  does  there  appear to be more  changes  than\r\n\r\nbefore?  Well, it is because we have been able  to\r\n\r\nconsolidate  and build up the base  which  enables\r\n\r\nthese changes to take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the implementation of the\r\n\r\nrestructuring  of  the education  system,  as  all\r\n\r\nMembers   know,   the   Ministry   is   in   close\r\n\r\nconsultation    with    the   teachers'    unions,\r\n\r\nprofessional bodies and those in the  field,  like\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers, on how best to  implement\r\n\r\nit.   For  example,  most  teachers'  unions  have\r\n\r\nalready set up their own committees to do  an  in-depth  study  of the implications, and  some  have\r\n\r\nalready made their recommendations to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry.  Recently, we had a series of  workshops\r\n\r\nand  seminars organised by principals with exactly\r\n\r\nthe  same purpose. It is also the intention of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  carry  out a  series  of  in-service\r\n\r\ncourses to prepare the principals and teachers for\r\n\r\nthe  proper  implementation of  these  changes.  I\r\n\r\nagree that many teething problems will be faced on\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of the new system at the end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year. Many of these problems, in fact,  have\r\n\r\nbeen  envisaged by the unions and the  principals,\r\n\r\nand  recommendations are being made. The  Ministry\r\n\r\nis presently studying them and adjustments will be\r\n\r\nmade where necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now deal with the more specific\r\n\r\nissues  of  the  restructuring  of  the  education\r\n\r\nsystem, which have been raised by various Members.\r\n\r\nThe   Member   for   Paya  Lebar   mentioned   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties that will be faced by schools with  a\r\n\r\nsmall  enrolment. He suggested that the Government\r\n\r\nshould  assist the merging of such small  schools,\r\n\r\nparticularly those in the rural areas. I could not\r\n\r\nagree  with him more. In fact, a couple  of  years\r\n\r\nago  the  former Minister of State for  Education,\r\n\r\nnow  the  Minister  of  State for  Communications,\r\n\r\nannounced that the Ministry encourages such moves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever possible, the Ministry will make\r\n\r\navailable land and financial assistance to  effect\r\n\r\nsuch  a  merger. In fact, merging  of  such  small\r\n\r\nschools  will also solve the problem, as cited  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Serangoon Gardens, of small schools\r\n\r\nhaving only two classes of students. With a  fair-sized school, this problem will be minimised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various questions have been asked on how\r\n\r\nassessment  will  be done. First  of  all,  may  I\r\n\r\nreiterate what I have said in public. The Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  recently done a very detailed analysis of the\r\n\r\nlast PSLE results. There appears to be a very good\r\n\r\ncorrelation  between  the  predicted  results   by\r\n\r\nschools  and the actual PSLE. We are sending  this\r\n\r\nassessment to individual schools so as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  assist them in making their assessment  as  to\r\n\r\nwhich  students  should  do  the  remaining  upper\r\n\r\nprimary in either three or four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Serangoon Gardens as well\r\n\r\nas  the  Member  for  Potong Pasir  mentioned  the\r\n\r\nstigma  on  the three or four-year upper  primary.\r\n\r\nLet  me  say  this. Whether a child completes  his\r\n\r\nupper  primary  in three years or four  years  has\r\n\r\nabsolutely  no impact whatsoever on the  secondary\r\n\r\neducation he will receive. He will have  to  cover\r\n\r\nthe  same syllabus. He will have to take the  same\r\n\r\nPrimary Schools Leaving Examination, and the  sort\r\n\r\nof   secondary  education  and  training  that  he\r\n\r\nreceives will depend on his performance then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens also asked about\r\n\r\nthe  restructuring  of  the secondary  level.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry is now finalising the broad framework for\r\n\r\nthe  secondary level, and this will be sent to the\r\n\r\nvarious  teachers' unions and professional  bodies\r\n\r\nfor comments. When finalised, it will then be made\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the point about\r\n\r\nthose   students  who  could  not  be  effectively\r\n\r\nbilingual. In my statement in November I did admit\r\n\r\nthat  those who were genuinely incapable of  being\r\n\r\neffectively bilingual would be given less exposure\r\n\r\ntime. Since then I have given much thought on this\r\n\r\nand recently I have made certain clarifications on\r\n\r\nthat point. First of all, I say that less exposure\r\n\r\ntime  will  be allowed for those who are genuinely\r\n\r\nincapable,  and  I expect the number  to  be  very\r\n\r\nsmall.  They  are  likely to  be  put  in  special\r\n\r\nclasses.  Perhaps they will not be  given  reduced\r\n\r\nexposure  time  as  originally  intended.  And  as\r\n\r\nsuggested  by the Member for Jurong, they  may  be\r\n\r\ngiven more intensive coaching; hence they have  to\r\n\r\nbe  put  in  special classes. We have to recognise\r\n\r\nthe  fact that we have to assist those people  who\r\n\r\ncannot be effectively bilingual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standardisation of performance and method of\r\n\r\nassessment is one of the topics discussed  at  the\r\n\r\nPrincipals'  seminar, and certain  recommendations\r\n\r\nhave been made. We are studying the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecommendations, which are very  similar  to  what\r\n\r\nhas been put up by the teachers' unions. This will\r\n\r\nbe  made  known to all the principals and teachers\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The channelling of students into either three or\r\n\r\nfour years' upper primary education will only take\r\n\r\nplace  in  December  this year.  Therefore,  those\r\n\r\nstudents who will be going to Primary IV  in  July\r\n\r\nthis  year  will not be affected by  this  change.\r\n\r\nThose  in  Primary 11 now and going on to  Primary\r\n\r\nIII  in July will be affected in June 1976. I hope\r\n\r\nthat clarifies the point raised by the Member  for\r\n\r\nJurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir also raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  that there will be more private tuition.\r\n\r\nI  am one who is not in favour of private tuition.\r\n\r\nBut  I  also  realise  the  parents'  anxiety   to\r\n\r\nencourage  their children to take private  tuition\r\n\r\nbecause of the restructuring. At the beginning  of\r\n\r\nthis  year  the Ministry conducted  a  very  brief\r\n\r\nsurvey on one well established mission school  and\r\n\r\none  typical Government-integrated school  on  the\r\n\r\ntrend on private tuition last year, and again this\r\n\r\nyear.  The  survey  is  not  conclusive,  but  the\r\n\r\nresults indicate that there is no rush for private\r\n\r\ntuition  for the Primary III pupils. I cannot  say\r\n\r\nalso if this is an island-wide phenomenon, as this\r\n\r\nsurvey was conducted only on two typical schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar suggested that we\r\n\r\nshould  not make public the GCE \"O\" and \"A\" levels\r\n\r\nresults in the press. He has a good point there  -- that it would produce a certain stigma on parents\r\n\r\nwhose children did not pass. I promise that I will\r\n\r\nlook  into  this matter to see whether  we  should\r\n\r\nreally  scrap the publication of these results  in\r\n\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the point of admission to\r\n\r\nPre-U  classes  and the different systems  adopted\r\n\r\nfor  the  English  and  non-English  streams.  The\r\n\r\nposition  is  this. Schools in the English  stream\r\n\r\nusually   have  their  \"O\"  level  results   known\r\n\r\nsometime at the end of March, while those  in  the\r\n\r\nnon-English stream\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave their results known by the end of January. In\r\n\r\nthe  past  we had a preliminary admission exercise\r\n\r\nfor the English stream but not for the non-English\r\n\r\nstream. This year I am afraid it was a freak  year\r\n\r\n-  there was a delay in the non-English stream and\r\n\r\nfor some strange reason the English stream results\r\n\r\nwere advanced by two weeks so that the results for\r\n\r\nboth streams were announced simultaneously. We are\r\n\r\nlooking   into  the  possibility   of   having   a\r\n\r\npreliminary  admission exercise  for  all  streams\r\n\r\nwhen  all  the Pre-U classes are confined  to  the\r\n\r\njunior  colleges. When this is done,  I  think  it\r\n\r\nwould be possible for us to adopt a similar system\r\n\r\nfor all the streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson raised the question about\r\n\r\nthe  teaching  of  civics and moral  education.  I\r\n\r\ncould  not  agree with him more. That  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  aspect of education. This is  not  only\r\n\r\nbeing  taught  in  the subject of  \"Education  for\r\n\r\nLiving\" or \"Civics\", but we try to incorporate  it\r\n\r\nin  other subjects as well. The reason why  we  do\r\n\r\nnot make it an examination subject is that, as  of\r\n\r\nnow,   our   education  system  is   already   too\r\n\r\nexamination-orientated. By adding another subject,\r\n\r\nwe  could make matters worse. They might learn  it\r\n\r\nby  heart  without  really  wanting  to  know  why\r\n\r\ncertain things ought to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson raised a series of\r\n\r\nquestions.  Why  do we not extend  the  `A'  level\r\n\r\nCommerce  examination  to  private  candidates  as\r\n\r\nwell?  The  GCE `A' level examination in  Commerce\r\n\r\nwas  introduced in 1970 as a pilot  project.  Over\r\n\r\nthe  last five years we have been able to  monitor\r\n\r\nits  development, and we are fairly satisfied that\r\n\r\nwe  can run it quite competently. It will be  open\r\n\r\nto  the  private  candidates in the  near  future;\r\n\r\nunfortunately not this year but most probably next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned something about private schools\r\n\r\ndoing  better  than Government or Government-aided\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  am afraid I have to dispute that statement. For\r\n\r\nexample, if you look at the results last year, 57%\r\n\r\nof the `A'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlevel  candidates from Government and  Government-aided  schools  obtained 2 `A's, 2 `0's  plus  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Paper, whereas only 14% from the  private\r\n\r\ncolleges  obtained the same grades.  Out  of  this\r\n\r\n14%,  only  1% managed to get into the University.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, although they get the same grade,\r\n\r\nthey are of a lower quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also enquired about the posting of\r\n\r\nstudents  nearest their homes. It is the intention\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry to post students to  schools  as\r\n\r\nnear  to their homes as possible. But we have also\r\n\r\nto  recognise  that  parents want  to  send  their\r\n\r\nchildren to schools of their own choice. Over  the\r\n\r\nlast  few  years,  about  95%  of  the  Primary  I\r\n\r\nstudents  have  been able to find  places  in  the\r\n\r\nschools of their own choice. Of the remaining  5%,\r\n\r\nmost  of them were posted to schools within  three\r\n\r\nkilometres from their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah raised a few\r\n\r\nquestions   regarding  the  teaching   of   second\r\n\r\nlanguage.  With 40% of the curriculum  time  being\r\n\r\ndevoted  to second languages, it will be extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult to put students taking different  second\r\n\r\nlanguages  in  the same class. It is  not  just  a\r\n\r\nquestion of administrative convenience by  putting\r\n\r\nthem   in   the  same  class.  In  fact,   it   is\r\n\r\neducationally   unwise  to  have   students   with\r\n\r\ndifferent  second  languages  in  the  same  class\r\n\r\nbecause  60%  of their time spent in one  language\r\n\r\nwill create one lot of classmates and 40% of their\r\n\r\ntime  will  have  a different lot  of  classmates.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the mingling-integration does not  begin\r\n\r\nreally   in  the  classrooms.  Students  arc   not\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  fool  and  mingle  around   in   the\r\n\r\nclassrooms.  They are supposed to  mingle  in  the\r\n\r\nfield  or  in activities where they can  socialise\r\n\r\ntogether.  Therefore,  we should  really  consider\r\n\r\nprogress in the school as a whole rather  than  by\r\n\r\nclasses. Principals have been advised to integrate\r\n\r\nchildren taking different second languages as  far\r\n\r\nas possible in activities such as extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities,  so as to achieve the objective  which\r\n\r\nthe Member mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked what happened to the second\r\n\r\nlanguages, especial-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nly Tamil as a second language in mission schools.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the number of students taking  Tamil\r\n\r\nas  a  second language is small. Therefore, it  is\r\n\r\nnot possible to have a second language Tamil (TL2)\r\n\r\nclass in every mission school. However, we have  a\r\n\r\ncentre  for  Tamil as a second language.  Students\r\n\r\nfrom  mission schools are sent to this  centre  to\r\n\r\nlearn  Tamil as a second language. He  also  asked\r\n\r\nwhy the three established Tamil centres - Bartley,\r\n\r\nBeatty  and Gan Eng Seng - were closed down.  With\r\n\r\nthe  exception of Beatty, both Bartley and Gan Eng\r\n\r\nSeng, I believe, were closed more than eight years\r\n\r\nago. It is not the result of a change in policy on\r\n\r\nbilingualism  or  of  the recent  changes.  Beatty\r\n\r\nSecondary School was changed this year. The reason\r\n\r\nis  this:  as  it stands, Beatty Secondary  School\r\n\r\ndoes  not have enough classrooms to cater for  its\r\n\r\nown  pupils. In attending these classes those  TL2\r\n\r\npupils had to float from one classroom to another.\r\n\r\nThis was rather unsatisfactory, and as a result we\r\n\r\nmoved  the  centre  to a school  where  sufficient\r\n\r\nclassrooms for TL2 are available for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 pm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson asked a few questions about\r\n\r\nthe Institute of Education. He wants me to give  a\r\n\r\nvery simple answer to the question on who wants to\r\n\r\nbe a teacher? May I assure him that in our present\r\n\r\nday   context  teaching  is  still  a  very  noble\r\n\r\nprofession.  There are many bright young  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  who aspire to be teachers when they  finish\r\n\r\ntheir   schooling.  During  the   last   admission\r\n\r\nexercise carried out a couple of months ago by the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Education  there  were  about   550\r\n\r\napplicants   for  the  Certificate  in   Education\r\n\r\ncourse. Due to the staffing position, we have only\r\n\r\nbeen  able to take in about 60. The ratio is about\r\n\r\n1  :  10.  Similarly, for the Diploma in Education\r\n\r\ncourse   for  graduates,  there  were  about   450\r\n\r\napplicants  for 90 places. The ratio  is  1  :  5.\r\n\r\nDespite   what   has  been  said,   the   teaching\r\n\r\nprofession still has its attractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member mentioned that there are some\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on  teachers who wish  to  pursue  a\r\n\r\ncourse  of  study, for example, academic  teachers\r\n\r\nstudying for a non-academic course. Let me  assure\r\n\r\nhim that no restriction is imposed by the Ministry\r\n\r\non  teachers who wish to pursue a course of  study\r\n\r\nin  his  own  time provided it does not  interfere\r\n\r\nwith  his work as a teacher. However, if he wishes\r\n\r\nto apply for study leave, then the course of study\r\n\r\nmust  be  relevant  to  the  requirement  of   the\r\n\r\nservice.   If   a   teacher   chooses   to   study\r\n\r\naccountancy,  for example, there  is  great  doubt\r\n\r\nwhether  he  will return to enrich  the  education\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also inquired about the posting of\r\n\r\nteachers  to  schools nearest their homes.  It  is\r\n\r\nmore  difficult than posting pupils nearest  their\r\n\r\nhomes for the simple reason that most teachers are\r\n\r\nconcentrated  in  a few housing estates,  such  as\r\n\r\nMarine  Parade, Thomson and Toa Payoh.  There  are\r\n\r\nalso  many schools in the rural areas where  there\r\n\r\nare  no  housing  estates, and  we  have  to  post\r\n\r\nteachers  to man these schools. It is not possible\r\n\r\nto  accede  to  the request of every  teacher  for\r\n\r\nposting to a school nearest his home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the promotion exercise, I am pleased to say\r\n\r\nthat  only  this  morning I received  confirmation\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Public  Service  Commission  that   the\r\n\r\nexercise  has been finalised and the results  will\r\n\r\nbe announced shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Good coincidence!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> The number of teachers promoted will be slightly\r\n\r\nmore  than the previous year. The Member for Anson\r\n\r\nis  most  probably  aware that the  procedure  for\r\n\r\nshortlisting this year has somewhat been  modified\r\n\r\nafter  consultation  with  the  various  teachers'\r\n\r\nunions.  As  a result, there will be  less  belly-aching this year. We will continue to improve upon\r\n\r\nthe  procedure so that there will be less  unhappy\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah asked about the\r\n\r\ntraining of teachers to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteach  Malay and Tamil as second language  at  the\r\n\r\nInstitute of Education. We are continuing to train\r\n\r\nthem  to  teach the language as a second language.\r\n\r\nWe are now working on a scheme to take in trainees\r\n\r\nwho do not have the required `A' levels to undergo\r\n\r\na  more  intensive programme of training as  first\r\n\r\nlanguage teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised two more questions\r\n\r\non  the conditions of service of teachers. One  is\r\n\r\non  medical benefits for those teachers  who  have\r\n\r\nretired. I believe this question was raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya Lebar in 1973 and it  was  again\r\n\r\nraised  by  the Member for Jurong in  1974.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid the reply is still the same. The Member for\r\n\r\nTelok   Blangah  may  quote  from  Hansard  again.\r\n\r\nBriefly, we have to look at the public service  as\r\n\r\na  whole  and  not on the teachers as an  isolated\r\n\r\nincidence.  They  have to be considered  in  toto.\r\n\r\nUnder  the present circumstances, I am afraid  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has been advised that it is not possible\r\n\r\nto  extend free medical benefits to those teachers\r\n\r\nwho have retired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the question of post\r\n\r\nallowance for principals. I believe he raised  the\r\n\r\nsame  question last year. The reply is  again  the\r\n\r\nsame.  The  abolition  of post  allowance  in  the\r\n\r\nrestructured  education system is  the  result  of\r\n\r\nvery  prolonged negotiations between the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Education,  Ministry  of  Finance   and   the\r\n\r\nteachers'  unions over a period of 18 months.  The\r\n\r\nreasons,    the   rationale   and    the    likely\r\n\r\nrepercussions  have  been gone  through  in  great\r\n\r\ndetail, and having reached that agreement there is\r\n\r\nno  possibility of going back and reintroduce  the\r\n\r\npost allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not true to say that there is no\r\n\r\nattraction in being a principal. Let us  take  the\r\n\r\nlast  promotion  exercise - not  the  one  I  just\r\n\r\nmentioned  but the one carried out two  years  ago\r\n\r\n-principals holding basic grades have  four  times\r\n\r\nas much chances to be promoted as teachers have in\r\n\r\ntheir own grades. Generally speaking, and as to be\r\n\r\nexpected, principals have better chances of  being\r\n\r\npromoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the question of relief teachers,\r\n\r\nwhich was raised by both the Members for Anson and\r\n\r\nTelok   Blangah.  The  Member  for  Telok  Blangah\r\n\r\nreminded me of the answers I gave when I  was  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary and Minister of State  for\r\n\r\nEducation.  I  am afraid I have to give  the  same\r\n\r\nreply today - as long as there is maternity leave,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be relief teachers. But I agree  with\r\n\r\nboth  Members  that it is not a very  satisfactory\r\n\r\narrangement.  We will try our best to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  relief teachers. At present there  are\r\n\r\nover  300  relief teachers for pure  vacancies  as\r\n\r\nagainst 800 when I replied to the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  in 1969. So there is a reduction of  more\r\n\r\nthan  50%.  This could, of course, be resolved  in\r\n\r\nvarious ways. Three hundred relief teachers  among\r\n\r\n20,000  teachers actually represents 1  1/2%.  One\r\n\r\nconvenient way is to do it administratively,  that\r\n\r\nis,  to increase the size of the class. But  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think this is very desirable. I would  rather\r\n\r\nthat  we  do  it  slowly  and  solve  the  problem\r\n\r\ngradually  by training more qualified teachers.  I\r\n\r\nhope  it will eventually be solved - not too  long\r\n\r\nbut  perhaps  within  a few years.  Three  hundred\r\n\r\nrelief    teachers   as   compared    to    20,000\r\n\r\nestablishments is not really a large number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On issues relating to the school management, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson said that there have been  cases\r\n\r\nwhere   students  have  been  forced  to   collect\r\n\r\ndonations   during  vacation.  Schools   are   not\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  do  that.  The  principals  are  not\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  sell lucky draw tickets and  solicit\r\n\r\ndonations.  In fact, in the past when  such  cases\r\n\r\nwere  discovered by the Ministry,  the  principals\r\n\r\nwere  warned. I should be grateful to  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson, should he come across such  cases,  to\r\n\r\nlet me know and we will take appropriate action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong made some reference to the\r\n\r\nofficers  in the uniformed movement. I agree  with\r\n\r\nhim  that  it  is  wrong to have in-camp  training\r\n\r\nduring the school term. I would bring this to  the\r\n\r\nattention of the Commandant to see that in  future\r\n\r\nthis training should not be allowed to disrupt the\r\n\r\nteaching process\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of the uniformed movement.  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  him that in-camp training  should  be\r\n\r\nconducted during vacation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about Intraco's donations\r\n\r\nas a matter of general interest. I do not have any\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  what  Intraco has  donated  to  the\r\n\r\nschools,  but  I believe that most  of  the  items\r\n\r\ndonated are new. But whether they are suitable  or\r\n\r\nnot  I  cannot vouch for them. I believe that  the\r\n\r\nonly  item  which was not new was the 30  odd  re-conditioned buses donated to schools. In  addition\r\n\r\nto  that,  Intraco donates a large  sum  of  money\r\n\r\nevery   now  and  then  to  schools  for   various\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson raised some questions on\r\n\r\ndonations  to the Education Fund. These  donations\r\n\r\nare  collected from foreign students and paid into\r\n\r\na fund known as the Education Fund. It is used for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of our students. For example,  every\r\n\r\nyear a large sum of money is being drawn from this\r\n\r\nFund  to subsidize our students to go overseas  or\r\n\r\nto go to the neighbouring countries on educational\r\n\r\ntours or for whatever activities the students wish\r\n\r\nto  engage in but are short of funds. I am  rather\r\n\r\nsurprised  that the hon. Member for  Anson  is  so\r\n\r\nconcerned about foreign students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations are required from foreign students for\r\n\r\na  very  simple  reason. Although  they  study  in\r\n\r\nprivate  schools  we ask for donation  from  them.\r\n\r\nPrivate  schools have been able to attract foreign\r\n\r\nstudents because of the educational infrastructure\r\n\r\nbuilt up by this Government at public expense over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  and  it  cost  millions  of  dollars.\r\n\r\nWithout Government efforts there would not be this\r\n\r\neducational infrastructure and the private schools\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  able to flourish and attract  that\r\n\r\nmany foreign students. Why should foreign students\r\n\r\ncome  to  Singapore and not elsewhere? Because  of\r\n\r\nthe  efforts  of the Government to build  up  this\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, I think it is only  fair  that  if\r\n\r\nforeign  students  wish to come here  and  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  our  efforts  they should  make  a  donation\r\n\r\ntowards  the  Education Fund to be  used  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of our students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have answered most of the points\r\n\r\nraised by hon. Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I would like to clarify two or three points.\r\n\r\nThe  first  point  is that the Minister  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  there are many applications for the post  of\r\n\r\nteachers. But may I ask the Minister why there are\r\n\r\n300 resignations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about foreign students. I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know  how  this  money  which  is\r\n\r\ncollected from the foreign students is being used.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  objecting  to the collection  of  this\r\n\r\nmoney. The money collected must be utilised for  a\r\n\r\nvery good purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that we must stop the practice\r\n\r\nof  asking students to collect donations  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister has promised he would look into  this.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  whatever  the Minister  says  here  is\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry I have to rise\r\n\r\nagain.  I  am  not satisfied with  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nanswer,   especially   that   concerning    relief\r\n\r\nteachers.  Perhaps it was because  I  raised  this\r\n\r\nissue  in  1971  when, according to the  Minister,\r\n\r\nthere were 800 relief teachers and that the number\r\n\r\nis  now  reduced to 300. I can assure the Minister\r\n\r\nthat  I  will  raise this problem again  in  three\r\n\r\nyears' time, unless the 300 is reduced to 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refuse to accept the Minister's contention that\r\n\r\nthere will be relief teachers so long as there are\r\n\r\nteachers  taking maternity leave. Sir, women  have\r\n\r\nbeen  going  on  maternity  leave  since  time  im\r\n\r\nmemorial. The problem of relief teachers arose not\r\n\r\ndecades  ago  but  a  decade  ago  or  even   more\r\n\r\nrecently. The Minister is aware that quite  a  few\r\n\r\nof   us   here   are  practising  teachers.   This\r\n\r\nphenomenon of unqualified relief teachers going to\r\n\r\nschools  to  teach came about only  six  or  seven\r\n\r\nyears ago. And in answer to the Member for Anson's\r\n\r\nquestion  as  to who wants to become teachers, he\r\n\r\nsaid  that  lots of people have applied to  become\r\n\r\nteachers. A-s I said, we should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrain  them and from this pool of trained teachers\r\n\r\nwe  can draw the number required to relieve  those\r\n\r\nwho go on maternity leave or any other leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, I appreciate some\r\n\r\nof  the  answers  given  by  the  Minister  to  my\r\n\r\nqueries. But when I cited the hypothetical case of\r\n\r\ntwo  classes  in a primary school,  I  was  merely\r\n\r\nsetting  a hypothetical situation to indicate  how\r\n\r\nclasses can multiply and teachers can be increased\r\n\r\nin number if the system is to be implemented. This\r\n\r\ntendency  to  multiply  need  not  necessarily  be\r\n\r\nlimited to the hypothetical case I have cited.  It\r\n\r\ncan happen to the case of two or more classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I did not, as the Minister said,\r\n\r\nmention  that a child having to do four  years  of\r\n\r\nupper  primary education after Primary III  has  a\r\n\r\nstigma  attached.  This is where  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nPotong   Pasir  stands  alone  in  this   profound\r\n\r\nobservation. But it did not issue from me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I did raise the query of how forms and\r\n\r\ncriteria  of assessment will be formulated  and  I\r\n\r\nwould appreciate a reply from the Minister on this\r\n\r\nquery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I also raised the question of how the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  a  child in the  second  language\r\n\r\nunder the new system in the three years of Primary\r\n\r\nschooling,  that is, Primaries I, II and  III,  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  he decided in so far as it  relates  to\r\n\r\nwhether a child will do four years or three  years\r\n\r\nof upper primary education after Primary III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also invite a response from the Minister\r\n\r\nto  my  suggestion that relief teachers should  in\r\n\r\nfuture  never be assigned to primary  classes,  at\r\n\r\nleast  in the first three years in the new system.\r\n\r\nNor  should teachers in the first three  years  of\r\n\r\nprimary education be transferred. In fact, I see a\r\n\r\nmerit   if  the  Minister  could  arrange  for   a\r\n\r\nsituation where the teacher who starts off with  a\r\n\r\nclass  in  Primary I follows the class through  to\r\n\r\nPrimary II and to Primary III, because at the  end\r\n\r\nof  Primary III that teacher will have a  thorough\r\n\r\nknowledge of his or her pupils and will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter  able  to  make  a  reliable  and  accurate\r\n\r\nassessment   of   the  academic   attainment   and\r\n\r\npotential of the child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I just want to refer briefly to a point that\r\n\r\nhas  been referred to indirectly by the Member for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu. From what he said, there seems to  be\r\n\r\none  matter not adequately considered, namely, the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  getting parents  to  understand  the\r\n\r\neducation  policy better. I hope in  this  respect\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry,  teachers'  unions  and  teachers'\r\n\r\nbodies will collaborate to put the idea across and\r\n\r\nget the cooperation of parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot promise the\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Blangah that if he were to  raise\r\n\r\nthe same question in three years' time, the number\r\n\r\nof  relief teachers will be cut down to 30. But  I\r\n\r\ncan  promise him that it will not be of  the  same\r\n\r\nmagnitude as it is today. If he will recall, in my\r\n\r\nreply  in  1971  I said that it was our  intention\r\n\r\nthat  eventually relief teachers would be  trained\r\n\r\nteachers, but they would still be relief teachers.\r\n\r\nThe  intention is that there will  be  a  pool  of\r\n\r\ntrained  teachers serving as relief  teachers  but\r\n\r\nthey will remain as relief teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must apologise to the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens  if  I  have grouped his queries  together\r\n\r\nwith the Member for Potong Pasir. My apologies  if\r\n\r\nI  have done so. I understand his sentiments.  His\r\n\r\npoint about the multiplying of classes due to  the\r\n\r\nrestructured system was well taken. We  are  aware\r\n\r\nof  this and this is, in fact, being planned  for.\r\n\r\nHe  asked  how  the form and standardisation  will\r\n\r\ncome  about  and also whether the second  language\r\n\r\nwill affect the question of channelling. As I said\r\n\r\njust  now, this is contained in the very  detailed\r\n\r\nrecommendations of principals and teachers' unions\r\n\r\nin a seminar. It is rather a lengthy report but it\r\n\r\nwill be made public very soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked for my assurance that relief\r\n\r\nteachers  will  not be posted to primary  schools,\r\n\r\nespecially from Primary I through to Primary  III,\r\n\r\nif they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  untrained  relief teachers, I  can  say  that\r\n\r\nperhaps in a few years' time this will not happen.\r\n\r\nBut  even now there are only about 100-odd  relief\r\n\r\nteachers in the primary schools, out of a total of\r\n\r\n15,000  teachers  in the establishment.  I  cannot\r\n\r\nagree  with  him more about his idea of  the  same\r\n\r\nteacher  following  through  from  Primary  I   to\r\n\r\nPrimary   III.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Teong Eng Siong, Sia Khoon Seong and Ho Kah Leong.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Addendum to the President's Speech it\r\n\r\nis said that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The education system will be restructured by\r\n\r\nstages  with the objective of reducing educational\r\n\r\nwastage,  improving  teaching  and  learning,  and\r\n\r\nincreasing the supply of trained manpower.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Under  the direction of the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nthe  restructuring  of  our education  system  has\r\n\r\nalready  been  carried out partially.  But  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion  there  is  one very important  aspect  of\r\n\r\neducation  which  concerns  the  future   of   our\r\n\r\ncountry, our social order and the happiness of our\r\n\r\nchildren and our children's children. I feel  that\r\n\r\nthis particular aspect should also be included  in\r\n\r\nthe restructuring of our education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, respect for the\r\n\r\nteachers was quite evident in Singapore. This  was\r\n\r\nbecause  the teachers were able to show  not  only\r\n\r\nkindness  but also able to exercise authority  and\r\n\r\nthe  students  were also alert.  Under  this  awe-inspiring authority of the teachers lazy  students\r\n\r\nhad   no  choice  but  work  hard  and  to  behave\r\n\r\nproperly.  But  today  the  situation  is  totally\r\n\r\ndifferent. We have even cases of students  beating\r\n\r\nup  teachers, much less giving any respect due  to\r\n\r\nthe  teachers. Such students are allowed to remain\r\n\r\nat  large. Why should it be allowed to deteriorate\r\n\r\nto  such  a  stage?  It  is because  some  of  our\r\n\r\neducation  policy makers believe too much  in  the\r\n\r\nlaissez faire policy of the West. Teachers do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the discretion to impose corporal punishment\r\n\r\non  students. If any teacher should dare to do  so\r\n\r\nhe will face the risk of losing his job. As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  result, students are at complete liberty to act\r\n\r\nas  they please and teachers do not have even  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  of  limited  corporal  punishment   or\r\n\r\ntaking limited action against students. That being\r\n\r\nso,  it has made the students lose any respect  or\r\n\r\nfear for their teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, some spoilt children or even\r\n\r\npampered  students complain to their parents  over\r\n\r\nthe  slightest admonishment. The parents will then\r\n\r\ntake  up  the  matter with the  school.  Then  the\r\n\r\nofficials of the Ministry of Education will pounce\r\n\r\non  the  teachers  on receipt  of  the  complaints\r\n\r\nwithout  any  further detailed investigation  into\r\n\r\nthe complaints. Under such circumstances, teachers\r\n\r\nare  always threatened by parents and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  and they find it very difficult  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  their duties as teachers,  particularly\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  unruly students. So  some  teachers\r\n\r\ntake the passive attitude of just teaching without\r\n\r\ntrying  to  control the students- if the  students\r\n\r\nwant  to go astray, let them go astray; why should\r\n\r\nI  care? That is the attitude and so there is lack\r\n\r\nof control over students and an absence of respect\r\n\r\nfor  the teachers. Sir, since the students do  not\r\n\r\nhave  even the slightest idea that due respect  is\r\n\r\nto  be  given to the teachers, how do  you  expect\r\n\r\nthem  to receive instruction or guidance from  the\r\n\r\nteachers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we admit that we can learn from the\r\n\r\nWest  of  its  advanced  technology  in  order  to\r\n\r\nimprove   our  standards,  we  should   not   copy\r\n\r\neverything  wholesale from the West. For  example,\r\n\r\nwhile materially we have yet to learn the advanced\r\n\r\nscience  and  technology, educationally  there  is\r\n\r\nlittle  good  to benefit from the West  where  the\r\n\r\nchildren  are  pampered and doted  upon  by  their\r\n\r\nparents  to  such excessiveness that the  children\r\n\r\ncan go their own way. They even become Beatles and\r\n\r\ntake  to  drugs.  Their education is  basically  a\r\n\r\nfailure.  So this is the apple cart of  the  West.\r\n\r\nWhy should we fall into the rut? Sir, if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  do not want to degenerate and embark upon  the\r\n\r\npath  of  self-destruction, if we really  want  to\r\n\r\nsave  our future generations from the ills of  the\r\n\r\nWest  and to uphold our oriental cultural virtues,\r\n\r\nthen  as a teacher myself, I would like to suggest\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for Education that  he  restores\r\n\r\nerstwhile good methods of teaching and controlling\r\n\r\nthe   students   and  allows  the   teachers   the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  to impose limited corporal  punishment\r\n\r\nas  and  when  necessary and then to  report  such\r\n\r\npunishment  to  the  parents and  the  principals.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  such  discretion could  be  experimented\r\n\r\nover a period before we conduct a review on it. In\r\n\r\nfact,   according  to  history  and  my   personal\r\n\r\nexperience as a school teacher over twenty  years,\r\n\r\nI  have  not  heard of any case  about  a  teacher\r\n\r\nbeating up a student to death, not even since  the\r\n\r\ndays of Adam and Eve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read in the English newspaper this morning\r\n\r\nabout a teacher beating up a student who had to be\r\n\r\nsent to the hospital for treatment. I believe that\r\n\r\nit  is  because the Ministry of Education has  not\r\n\r\ngiven  the  discretion to the teachers  to  impose\r\n\r\nlimited corporal punishment. So since teachers are\r\n\r\nnot  allowed  to  carry a cane in class  and  when\r\n\r\nstudents  misbehave, some teachers may lose  their\r\n\r\nhead  and give a tight slap with their bare hands,\r\n\r\nthereby    resulting   in   the   student    being\r\n\r\nhospitalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, your time is up. Mr Teong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under this amendment, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  two  questions. One, would the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider building an auditorium for the Naval Base\r\n\r\nSecondary  School? According to my  understanding,\r\n\r\nthis school has more than 2,000 students. It is  a\r\n\r\nschool   of   considerable  size,  but   what   is\r\n\r\nsurprising is that it has no school hall  at  all.\r\n\r\nThis  is  very  regrettable.  We  know  that   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  is  promoting  extramural\r\n\r\nactivities and encouraging students to  take  part\r\n\r\nin  uniformed  group activities,  such  as  school\r\n\r\nband, dancing, singing,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchoir,  and  so  on. In this way,  the  extramural\r\n\r\nactivities  of the students can be enriched.  But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, the Naval Base Secondary School has\r\n\r\nno  school  hall.  The  teachers  responsible  for\r\n\r\ndancing  and singing are not able to conduct  such\r\n\r\nactivities   in  a  proper  place.  It   is   also\r\n\r\nimpossible for the school to hold any performances\r\n\r\nor  shows  in the school itself. I would therefore\r\n\r\nlike to ask whether the Minister has any plans  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  school hail for the Naval Base Secondary\r\n\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is that I have heard some remarks\r\n\r\nfrom  teachers  and  members  of  the  public  and\r\n\r\nparents to the effect that something is wrong with\r\n\r\nour  secondary schools. To be more specific,  Sir,\r\n\r\nit  has  been  noticed that many secondary  school\r\n\r\nstudents  are sporting long hair. This is  a  very\r\n\r\nbad  impression. Some teachers themselves are  not\r\n\r\nbehaving   in  the  proper  manner.  Some   female\r\n\r\nteachers  like to wear very colourful or thin  and\r\n\r\nrevealing  dresses.  In  the  case  of  some  male\r\n\r\nteachers,  they attire themselves in mod  fashion.\r\n\r\nThese  teachers are not setting a good example  to\r\n\r\nthe  students. I would therefore like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned to consider the suggestion  of\r\n\r\nrequiring the teachers in secondary schools to put\r\n\r\non   uniforms.  Since  doctors  and  nurses   wear\r\n\r\nuniforms  why  not  make teachers  wear  uniforms?\r\n\r\nUniforms will not only be pleasant to look at  but\r\n\r\nthey  also  give  a  dignified appearance  to  the\r\n\r\nteaching profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point is that in the Polytechnic\r\n\r\nthere  are students who keep long hair. They  even\r\n\r\nattend   classes  in  slippers.  What  manner   of\r\n\r\nbehaviour  is this? I would like the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nimmediately look into this matter and  take  steps\r\n\r\nto rectify this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on Teachers' Day last year, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education announced that his Ministry\r\n\r\nwas planning a staff development scheme to provide\r\n\r\nteachers  with  opportunities  for  academic   and\r\n\r\nprofessional   advancement.  According   to   him,\r\n\r\ninitially, courses leading to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvanced  stage  of the Certificate  of  Education\r\n\r\nwould  be conducted by the Institute of Education.\r\n\r\nAt a later stage there would be courses leading to\r\n\r\nthe  Bacheior of Education degree. These  courses\r\n\r\nwould be open to serving teachers with HSC or  GCE\r\n\r\n`A'  level. My question to the Minister  is:  have\r\n\r\nthe  plans  been finalised and, if so,  when  will\r\n\r\nthese courses be run? I wish also to find out from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  whether he will consider  extending\r\n\r\nthese courses to serving teachers without the  HSC\r\n\r\nor the GCE `A' level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  when  he  made  the  request  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education to restore to teachers  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion to impose corporal punishment, that  is\r\n\r\nto  say,  \"to return the cane to the teachers.\"  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that the students are getting more and  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  control,  and  discipline  in   the\r\n\r\nschools  is on the decline from day to day.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  we  have  more and  more  delinquents  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Juvenile delinquency is mounting  from\r\n\r\nyear  to year and the committee which looked  into\r\n\r\nthis  matter  has also recommended  that  teachers\r\n\r\nshould  be given the discretion to impose corporal\r\n\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Education will certainly\r\n\r\nturn  round and say that if we give the cane  back\r\n\r\nto  the  teachers, some of them will  abuse  their\r\n\r\npower and discretion to use the cane. In that case\r\n\r\nif  we give only limited authority to the teachers\r\n\r\nto  impose  corporal punishment as the Member  for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar suggested, for example to use the cane\r\n\r\non  the  palms or buttocks, then a lot of problems\r\n\r\nof discipline can be solved. Of course, we realise\r\n\r\nthat  at the present moment principals and  senior\r\n\r\nassistants  are  authorised  to  impose   corporal\r\n\r\npunishment.  But  from  what  I  understand,  most\r\n\r\nprincipals  and  senior teachers avoid  exercising\r\n\r\nsuch  authority because they know that in imposing\r\n\r\nany  corporal punishment they are required to  put\r\n\r\nup  a lengthy report to the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nSo to save all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  trouble of putting up a long-winded  report,\r\n\r\nthey  avoid taking this action and the  matter  is\r\n\r\nput in abeyance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the question of whether or not\r\n\r\nteachers should be given the discretion to  impose\r\n\r\ncorporal  punishment is a matter to  be  seriously\r\n\r\nconsidered.  If  the Ministry of Education  cannot\r\n\r\ncome  to  any  decision, perhaps  we  can  hold  a\r\n\r\nreferendum among the teachers to decide. I believe\r\n\r\nthat  if  a  referendum is held,  we  will  get  a\r\n\r\ndefinite answer from the teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to endorse respect for the\r\n\r\nteachers,  the Ministry has been very generous  in\r\n\r\nholding  a Teachers' Day every year. The  teachers\r\n\r\nare very grateful for this gesture. Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nTeachers' Day falls on the 1st September of  every\r\n\r\nyear,  which  happens  to  be  during  the  school\r\n\r\nvacation.  Perhaps the Ministry of  Education  had\r\n\r\ndeliberately  chosen this day to fall  within  the\r\n\r\nschool  vacation. I do not really know. But  as  a\r\n\r\nresult   of   this   coincidence   or   deliberate\r\n\r\narrangement,  teachers  do  not  really  enjoy   a\r\n\r\nholiday.  So much of the significance of Teachers'\r\n\r\nDay  is lost. In order to attach true significance\r\n\r\nto  the Day, I would ask the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nto consult the teachers' bodies to fix a different\r\n\r\ndate for Teachers' Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the purpose of education is to inculcate a\r\n\r\nsense  of  proper  social  discipline  among   the\r\n\r\nstudents.  I cannot agree more that we should  not\r\n\r\nbe too indulgent towards our young. I do not think\r\n\r\nthat  indisciplined students is the direct  result\r\n\r\nof  the withdrawal of the cane from teachers. Even\r\n\r\n2,000 years ago we had Judas betraying his mentor.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  present  system  the  regulation   for\r\n\r\ncorporal  punishment is flexible enough to  enable\r\n\r\nthe  principal to exercise considerable discretion\r\n\r\nto  designate  any  teacher to mete  out  corporal\r\n\r\npunishment. I believe the same assurance was given\r\n\r\nby  my  predecessor, the present Minister for  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment, two years ago on the same issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang asked about the Naval\r\n\r\nBase  Secondary  School. If  I  recall  correctly,\r\n\r\nNaval  Base  Secondary  School  was  originally  a\r\n\r\nprimary school and it has since become a secondary\r\n\r\nschool.  Therefore, it has only a  small  canteen.\r\n\r\nThe   Ministry  is,  in  fact,  looking  into  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of building a school  hall  for  this\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of long hair, we have certain\r\n\r\nregulations which are, in fact, widely observed in\r\n\r\nthe  civil service. I do not think the problem  is\r\n\r\nreally  that serious. Sometimes it is  actually  a\r\n\r\nquestion of discretion as to what constitutes long\r\n\r\nhair, and what is not. It is not something that is\r\n\r\neasily quantifiable. As long as it is tidy and not\r\n\r\ntoo  long,  I  think it should be  all  right.  He\r\n\r\nquoted a technical secondary school in particular.\r\n\r\nThe technical secondary school follows exactly the\r\n\r\nsame regulations in the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of clarification, Sir,I would like to\r\n\r\ncorrect one point. When I quoted the case of  long\r\n\r\nhair,   I   was   referring   to   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic. The Minister talked about the problem\r\n\r\nof  what is long hair and what is not. I think  we\r\n\r\nshould  have a standard, and the Minister's  hair-length is a good standard to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, I have mentioned that we have a certain\r\n\r\nstandard for civil servants, and there are posters\r\n\r\nto show what is long hair and what is not, e.g, if\r\n\r\nthe  hair is allowed to cover the collar  and  the\r\n\r\nears,  it is considered long hair, and so on.  The\r\n\r\nMember mentioned the Singapore Polytechnic: we are\r\n\r\ntrying  gradually  to  impose  certain  rules   in\r\n\r\nrespect of Polytechnic students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid his proposal for uniforms is not\r\n\r\nenforceable. In fact, I hate to see teachers  come\r\n\r\nto  classes in uniforms. I am afraid it is  not  a\r\n\r\npractical  suggestion and  we  might  get  a  very\r\n\r\nsterile service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of clarification, Sir,I disagree with the\r\n\r\nMinister's  statement that my  suggestion  is  not\r\n\r\npractical. Every school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas its own uniform for its students. The ratio of\r\n\r\nstudents  to teachers is in the region of  30:  1.\r\n\r\nThe number of teachers is very small. So it is not\r\n\r\ntoo  difficult if we ask the teachers  to  put  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own  uniforms.  And  if  the  Ministry  can\r\n\r\nallocate  funds  for uniforms,  it  will  be  more\r\n\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, there are only 65 Members of Parliament here\r\n\r\nand we are supposed to wear white shirts. I do not\r\n\r\nsee  the Member for Sembawang wearing white shirt.\r\n\r\nThat answers his problem of uniforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein raised the question of\r\n\r\nstall  development programme. I am pleased to  say\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  finalised the curriculum  for  the\r\n\r\nadvanced  Certificate  of  Education  course   and\r\n\r\ninvitations   will  be  sent  out  to   interested\r\n\r\nteachers to apply for such a course. We will  also\r\n\r\nbe  implementing two other schemes, that  is,  the\r\n\r\nOverseas  Scholarship Scheme,  to  send  deserving\r\n\r\nstaff  with  the necessary qualifications  to  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom to do an undergraduate's course  in\r\n\r\nEnglish.  There  is  a  great  shortage  of  these\r\n\r\nteachers.  In  addition, recently we  announced  a\r\n\r\nsponsorship  scheme  whereby  successful  teachers\r\n\r\nwould be sent to the local university to pursue an\r\n\r\nundergraduate  course.  As  for  the   course   in\r\n\r\nBachelor of Education, we have yet to finalise the\r\n\r\ncurriculum, and I am afraid it will not be in time\r\n\r\nfor the coming academic year. It will be ready  by\r\n\r\nthe next academic year, which will be sometime  in\r\n\r\n1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the question of\r\n\r\nTeachers' Day. The Teachers' Day was fixed on  the\r\n\r\n1st   September  many  years  ago  to  honour  and\r\n\r\nremember  this very noble profession. If Teachers'\r\n\r\nDay  is to have any meaning at all, it should  not\r\n\r\nbe changed or altered just because the school term\r\n\r\nhas  been revised. Teachers' Day has been observed\r\n\r\nall  along  at a time when it did not fall  within\r\n\r\nthe  holidays. I am afraid the Member  for  Jurong\r\n\r\ngot  it wrong that the Ministry of Education fixed\r\n\r\nit so that it coincides with the holidays. With  a\r\n\r\ngreater  intake  in  July and  the  likelihood  of\r\n\r\nintroducing two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGCE  examinations  per year, the  school  term  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  further changed. Are  we  then  to\r\n\r\nchange  the  Teachers' Day again if it happens  to\r\n\r\ncoincide  with  a  holiday? It is  something  very\r\n\r\nsignificant  and we cannot change it just  because\r\n\r\nit  happens to fall within the school holidays for\r\n\r\nthe last few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered one of my\r\n\r\nquestions  and that is, will he consider extending\r\n\r\nthe  courses that I mentioned to serving  teachers\r\n\r\nwithout  the HSC or the GCE `A' level? Because  in\r\n\r\nhis  announcement it was stated that teachers must\r\n\r\npossess those qualifications before they could  be\r\n\r\ninvited to these courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, during the initial stage, the answer is no.\r\n\r\nPerhaps at a later stage we might consider when we\r\n\r\nare able to carry out the scheme smoothly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, earlier on the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nmentioned that the discretion of limited  corporal\r\n\r\npunishment has been given to principals and senior\r\n\r\nteachers.  I  do not know whether  he  realises  a\r\n\r\nsituation  like  this.  If  there  are  50  or  60\r\n\r\nteachers in charge of 1,000 students, is that  not\r\n\r\nbetter than having only one or two senior teachers\r\n\r\nto  control  the whole student population  in  the\r\n\r\nschool?   Of   course,  I  will  answer   in   the\r\n\r\naffirmative - it is better to allow all the 50  or\r\n\r\n60 teachers to control the students, as the effect\r\n\r\nof  their  control will be more  evident.  I  have\r\n\r\nalready given my reasons for such a situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> I do not think the Member for Paya Lebar\r\n\r\nunderstood what I have said.

P. Rodrigo and Ho See Beng).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently a number of mathematics and science\r\n\r\nteachers  in  secondary  schools  have  complained\r\n\r\nabout  the attitude of some specialist inspectors.\r\n\r\nIn  Chinese  secondary schools  both  science  and\r\n\r\nmathematics  are  taught  in  English,   and   the\r\n\r\ntextbooks  are  also  in  English.  Most  of   the\r\n\r\nteachers of such subjects are graduates of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  Although  the Nanyang  graduates  are\r\n\r\nbilingual, they are not very much at home  in  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  the English language because English  has\r\n\r\nbeen   their  second  language  throughout   their\r\n\r\nprimary,  secondary and university  education.  So\r\n\r\nthey are not as proficient in English as they  are\r\n\r\nin  Chinese,  which is their first language.  This\r\n\r\ndeficiency  is  especially  seen  when  they  come\r\n\r\nacross technical terms and difficult words in  the\r\n\r\nteaching of these subjects. Therefore, in order to\r\n\r\nmake   their  students  understand  better,   they\r\n\r\nintermix    their   explanations    in    Chinese.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately some specialist inspectors  seem  to\r\n\r\nprefer  to assess the proficiency of such teachers\r\n\r\nin  the  English language, which is  their  second\r\n\r\nlanguage,  instead  of  the  benefits   to   their\r\n\r\nstudents.  These  inspectors  forget  that   these\r\n\r\nteachers  came  from the Chinese stream.  So  they\r\n\r\n\"split  hairs\"  over the standard  of  English  of\r\n\r\nthese teachers. This is very regrettable, Sir, and\r\n\r\nI  hope the Minister will seriously look into this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next matter I wish to raise is the public\r\n\r\nstatement  by  the  Minister  for  Education  that\r\n\r\nChinese as the second\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlanguage  in  the  English stream  has  reached  a\r\n\r\nhigher   standard  than  English  as  the   second\r\n\r\nlanguage  in  the Chinese stream. As a  result  of\r\n\r\nthis statement the school inspectors in charge  of\r\n\r\nsecond language teaching are very worried. So they\r\n\r\nvisit  all the various Chinese schools,  not  with\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of advising the teachers how to raise\r\n\r\nthe standard of English as the second language but\r\n\r\nto  tell the teachers, \"My superior has pulled  me\r\n\r\nup,  so I must pull you up in turn.\" How can  such\r\n\r\nan  attitude  be justified? This is not  a  proper\r\n\r\nattitude  for  school  inspectors  to  take.  They\r\n\r\ncannot just pull up teachers like that. What  they\r\n\r\nshould do is to advise the teachers and guide them\r\n\r\nas  to  how to improve the standard of English  as\r\n\r\nthe  second language in Chinese schools, and  thus\r\n\r\nachieve the objective of bilingualism. I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will look into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, under this subhead I intend to touch on\r\n\r\nprofessional areas of responsibility  relating  to\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of  teaching  in  the  service  and\r\n\r\nproblems related to the management of education in\r\n\r\nprivate  schools. One reads of pupils  who  cannot\r\n\r\ncount correctly, pupils who cannot speak correctly\r\n\r\nand  pupils  who cannot spell correctly,  and  one\r\n\r\ngets distressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the tacit claim that the Institute of\r\n\r\nEducation   produces  well   trained,   able   and\r\n\r\ncommitted  teachers. But it appears  that  pupils'\r\n\r\nperformance  capacities  keep  falling.  Are   our\r\n\r\npupils becoming increasingly unteachable? Or  have\r\n\r\nthe  well  trained,  able and  committed  teachers\r\n\r\nbecome  untrained, unable and uncommitted teachers\r\n\r\nafter  a few years in the teaching service and  in\r\n\r\nthe  profession?  If  so, then  there  is  in  the\r\n\r\nservice  and profession a factor or factors  which\r\n\r\nare  dissipating the teachers' expertise and their\r\n\r\ncommitment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these factors? For one, is it the\r\n\r\noverwhelming  number  of  women  teachers  in  the\r\n\r\nschools?  This is not to imply that women teachers\r\n\r\nare  inferior teachers, but I have heard  it  said\r\n\r\nthat they find it difficult to ensure a disciplin-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ned  class in which only effective teaching can  be\r\n\r\nachieved. Is it because school heads are unable to\r\n\r\nbe  as  effective  as they should  in  maintaining\r\n\r\nstandards  or  is  it because of  factors  in  the\r\n\r\neducation service relating to promotion prospects?\r\n\r\nOr  is  it  a malaise, an inertia that is settling\r\n\r\nupon  the teachers eventuating in a commitment  to\r\n\r\nopt  out of a commitment to teach? And if  so,  we\r\n\r\nstill have to know why this is happening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is pointless to rationalise that\r\n\r\nthe  quality of teaching is satisfactory,  that  a\r\n\r\nfew  teachers have deteriorated in their standard,\r\n\r\nthese  being  a  fraction of the large  number  of\r\n\r\nteachers  and  that, generally, all is  well.  The\r\n\r\ndisturbing  factor in the logic of  poor  teachers\r\n\r\nand  substandard teaching is that the pupil, being\r\n\r\nthe  product of the teaching of his teachers, will\r\n\r\nwhen  he  himself becomes a teacher, be a  teacher\r\n\r\nwith  that much less to give, despite the training\r\n\r\nhe   will  have  received  in  the  institute   of\r\n\r\nEducation.  Thus it appears that if the  situation\r\n\r\nis  not  corrected,  there is  a  process  towards\r\n\r\ninferior  human  resource  -  something  which  we\r\n\r\ncannot  afford.  Sir,  I am  not  particularly  in\r\n\r\nsearch of sources to lay blame on. I am expressing\r\n\r\nan anxiety which I hope will invite the Minister's\r\n\r\ngreater attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to touch on the role of the\r\n\r\nschool head in primary schools. This has been  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  much articulation in the past  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  all  sources  that matter  agree  that  the\r\n\r\nschool head should devote a sizable portion of his\r\n\r\ntime to classroom performance in order to maintain\r\n\r\nand  raise  the general standard of teaching,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the  standard  of  education   in   the\r\n\r\ncountry.  Although there is agreement on  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry,  there  is hardly  any  appreciable\r\n\r\nimprovement in the opportunity of the school  head\r\n\r\nto  worry about matters relating to education.  He\r\n\r\nis  burdened  with  administrative  work  and  any\r\n\r\namount  of injunction to the school head to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of teaching in his school  will  be\r\n\r\nfutile  in  the  face  of numerous  administrative\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  which  heads  are  required   to\r\n\r\nperform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the school head in all this\r\n\r\nadministration work, he has one clerical assistant\r\n\r\nwho is not authorised to sign on his behalf. As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  much  that can be done  in  the  area  of\r\n\r\neducational  development is  not  undertaken  with\r\n\r\nemphasis.  `This  includes the  implementation  of\r\n\r\nsyllabus, choice of textbooks, guidance to project\r\n\r\nwork,   supervision  of  staff,   supervision   of\r\n\r\ndiscipline of the school arid setting the role and\r\n\r\nleadership of the school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this problem, Sir, has the\r\n\r\nadministration   explored  the   feasibility   and\r\n\r\ndesirability  of reverting to the  system  of  one\r\n\r\nhead  for  one  school  session?  In  the  present\r\n\r\nsituation, the application of this change will not\r\n\r\ncause  additional  money  as  the  appointment  of\r\n\r\nschool  heads is not a salary appointment as  such\r\n\r\ntoday but an assignment of office. In addition, or\r\n\r\nalternatively,    school   accounts    or    other\r\n\r\nadministrative matters may be centralised  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry, thus relieving school heads to attend to\r\n\r\nperformance  in the classroom. This responsibility\r\n\r\nmay  then be properly supervised by inspectors  of\r\n\r\nschools  who  are now termed Education Development\r\n\r\nOfficers  and  who thereby would at least  and  at\r\n\r\nlast   be   doing   a  job  which   befits   their\r\n\r\ndesignation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho See Beng is not here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Paya Lebar\r\n\r\nmentioned   that   in   Chinese   schools    since\r\n\r\nmathematics and science are taught in English  the\r\n\r\nschool inspector, or advisor as lie is called now,\r\n\r\nappears  to  pay more attention to  the  teacher's\r\n\r\npronunciation of English rather than  on  content.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  he drew my attention to this problem  a\r\n\r\nfew  months  ago  to two specific  cases.  I  have\r\n\r\nlooked  into  these two specific cases  where  the\r\n\r\nadverse  comment  is  really  on  the  method   of\r\n\r\nteaching - the teacher's approach and technique  - rather than the command of the second language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think in the assessment of a teacher's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperformance,  it is how well lie  can  impart  his\r\n\r\nknowledge which is of overriding importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is a prevailing occurrence\r\n\r\nwhere   an   inspector  of   school   hammered   a\r\n\r\nmathematics and science teacher because he  cannot\r\n\r\npronounce the terms properly or the school advisor\r\n\r\nscolded teachers for not doing well. I agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  Member  that  the job of the  advisor  is  to\r\n\r\nadvise  and  he is not supposed to scold.  If  the\r\n\r\nMember is aware of such cases, please let me  know\r\n\r\nand perhaps I could advise the advisor to advise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens referred to the\r\n\r\nso-called falling standard of pupils' performance.\r\n\r\nI  think this is a world-wide problem. Is it  true\r\n\r\nthat the pupils' performance is falling, or is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  the  demands  of the  modern  times  have\r\n\r\nincreased? I would like to refer the Member  to  a\r\n\r\nreport  published recently in the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\ncalled  the Bullock Report on Reading. It  studied\r\n\r\nwhether the standard of English has gone down. Has\r\n\r\nit  actually  gone  down? No, the  demand  on  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of English has gone up. I think  we  are\r\n\r\nfacing  the  same  problem here.  The  demands  on\r\n\r\nschool  leavers have gone up. I do not  think  the\r\n\r\nstandard   of   education  has   gone   down.   In\r\n\r\nparticular, I do not think the quality of teachers\r\n\r\nhas  gone down. Academic-wise, in the past we used\r\n\r\nto take in trainees with `0' levels. Now we insist\r\n\r\non `A' levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are conducting in-service courses throughout\r\n\r\nthe  year  for  serving teachers to upgrade  their\r\n\r\nskills.   From  the  overwhelming  response   from\r\n\r\nteachers  to  attend these in-service  courses,  I\r\n\r\nhave no doubt whatsoever of the dedication of  our\r\n\r\nteachers  who  are highly motivated  to  excel  in\r\n\r\ntheir work. There may be a few odd birds who  join\r\n\r\nthe service because there are no other jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  out of an establishment of 20,000 teachers  I\r\n\r\nam  quite satisfied that the majority of them  are\r\n\r\nas dedicated as we expect them to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member mentioned about the administrative\r\n\r\nburden on principals in primary schools. I for one\r\n\r\nam greatly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  favour  of  relieving the  principals  of  any\r\n\r\nadministrative burden. But unfortunately there  is\r\n\r\na  certain amount of administrative work which  he\r\n\r\nhas to do. In fact, the Ministry was quite keen on\r\n\r\nthat  and  a  request was made to  the  Management\r\n\r\nServices Department, in the Ministry of Finance to\r\n\r\ndo a study on how best this could be done. We were\r\n\r\nproposing,  for  example,  to  have  an  Executive\r\n\r\nOfficer    attached   to   a   secondary   school.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  after  some  detailed  study   the\r\n\r\nManagement  Services Department came  out  with  a\r\n\r\nnegative answer. They said that it did not warrant\r\n\r\nthe  posting  of an Executive Officer  to  such  a\r\n\r\nschool  but they recommended the reduction of  the\r\n\r\nsize  of  the school and that in a school  with  a\r\n\r\nlarge enrolment additional clerks could be posted.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  when the school building programme  is\r\n\r\ncompleted we should be able to considerably reduce\r\n\r\nthe school size and the administrative work of the\r\n\r\nprincipal will be reduced accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of the detailed reply and assurance\r\n\r\ngiven by the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper Supplement:-\r\n\r\n<pre> \r\n\r\n<br>Mr Tay Boon Too:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (4) That the sum to be allocated for Head W be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 1107.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (5) That the sum to be allocated for Head W be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 1111.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>Mr Ho See Beng:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (6) That the sum to be allocated for Head W be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead CDA 1201.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (7) That the sum to be allocated for Head W be \r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead CEA 1109.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>Mr L.

As  the  Government\r\n\r\nstatement said, the Nanyang University must  catch\r\n\r\nup with its development into a university of equal\r\n\r\nstanding with the University of Singapore, and the\r\n\r\nappointment of the Education Minister as the Vice-Chancellor is the first step in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the establishment of the Nanyang University\r\n\r\nwas  to  solve the problem of further studies  for\r\n\r\nstudents  of  the various language streams.  Since\r\n\r\nits   establishment  the  Nanyang  University  has\r\n\r\nweathered   many  a  storm.  All   along   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  has suffered from antenatal deficiency\r\n\r\nand post-natal maladjustment. With the appointment\r\n\r\nof  the Education Minister as the Vice-Chancellor,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  no doubt that Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nwill  develop rapidly into a university  of  equal\r\n\r\nstanding with the University of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must stress that there is also no doubt\r\n\r\nabout   the   academic  achievements  of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  graduates. The  only  disadvantage  is\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  not as proficient in  English  as\r\n\r\nthose  purely  English educated graduates  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore. Nanyang University should\r\n\r\nemphasise  upon  their students a greater  use  of\r\n\r\nEnglish, which is their second language, so as  to\r\n\r\nbetter   equip  them  for  their  jobs.   However,\r\n\r\nirrespective of the language stream, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust emphasise on the fostering of bilingualism in\r\n\r\norder  to  fulfil  our national policy  of  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Government statement said that Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  campus  extends  to  500  acres.   The\r\n\r\ndevelopment potential of this campus has not  been\r\n\r\nfully exploited to meet the national requirements.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  know that the new Vice-Chancellor  is  a\r\n\r\nlearned engineer with a Ph.D degree. When he takes\r\n\r\nover  in  his new appointment he will be  able  to\r\n\r\nassess the situation and develop the potentials of\r\n\r\nthe massive campus of Nanyang University according\r\n\r\nto  its  topography, bordering  the  sea  and  the\r\n\r\nJurong  Industrial Town, the largest in Singapore.\r\n\r\nHe  will  also  be  able  to  introduce  practical\r\n\r\nsubjects and courses in order to meet our national\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next step towards equalising the status\r\n\r\nof Nanyang University with University of Singapore\r\n\r\nis  that  the service conditions of the  staff  of\r\n\r\nboth  the  Nanyang  University and  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should be the same, particularly  those\r\n\r\nin  regard  to  fringe benefits. According  to  my\r\n\r\nunderstanding,   staff  of   the   University   of\r\n\r\nSingapore can apply for low-interest housing loans\r\n\r\nwhereas  those in Nanyang University do not  enjoy\r\n\r\nthis   good  privilege.  I  hope  the  new   Vice-Chancellor  will  look into this  matter  when  he\r\n\r\nassumes   duty,  so  that  the  staff  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  may similarly enjoy the benefit  of  a\r\n\r\nhousing loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very glad to say that the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has made available  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars  to  Nanyang  University   as   a\r\n\r\nrevolving fund for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very glad to hear the good\r\n\r\nnews.

Thus,   the  Institute   helps   the\r\n\r\nadvancement  of industries in Jurong in  no  small\r\n\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I was told and I have seen for myself\r\n\r\nthe defects in the building of the Institute, as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  piling work carried  out  in  its\r\n\r\nvicinity  in  recent years. The major defects  are\r\n\r\ndeep  cracks on the walls, and ceilings and sunken\r\n\r\nfloors.  Due  to the sinking ground  the  drainage\r\n\r\nsystem has been totally destroyed. Water flows  in\r\n\r\ndirections where it should not flow. Water remains\r\n\r\nstagnant  here  and there. I understand  that  the\r\n\r\nInstitute has requested the Ministry to make  good\r\n\r\nall the defects. But so far the major defects have\r\n\r\nstill  not  been repaired. I do not know  what  is\r\n\r\nholding  back  the repair work. Can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nenlighten this House as to when all these  defects\r\n\r\nwill be repaired?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as this subject happens to be my\r\n\r\narea   of   interest,  I  have   to   deprive   my\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  of  the   pleasure   of\r\n\r\nreplying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong Vocational Institute was built on\r\n\r\nreclaimed  land  which consists of  a  very  thick\r\n\r\nlayer   of   peats.  The  design  of  the   Jurong\r\n\r\nVocational  Institute is such that the  loads  are\r\n\r\ntransferred from beams to the columns  on  to  the\r\n\r\npile  which go to the hard layer below the  peats.\r\n\r\nAll  the  floors are suspended floors so that  the\r\n\r\nloads  from  the  machines and  human  beings  are\r\n\r\ntransferred to the floor beam which in turn go  on\r\n\r\nto  the piles. On the other hand, such areas  like\r\n\r\nthe  apron  and  passage  way  which  are  not  of\r\n\r\ncritical importance are not constructed that  way.\r\n\r\nThey are built directly on the filled ground. As a\r\n\r\nresult   of   the  consolidation  of  the   peats,\r\n\r\nsettlement  takes place and the apron  settles  in\r\n\r\nrelation to the pile, and therefore we have  these\r\n\r\ncracks. I believe, the PWD had already taken these\r\n\r\nfactors   into  consideration  in  their   design.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is no structural danger  in  this\r\n\r\nbuilding.

It  has  proved  to   be\r\n\r\neffective.   Thus,  many  industrial   and   trade\r\n\r\npremises   which  used  to  cause  excessive   air\r\n\r\npollution have now been brought under surveillance\r\n\r\nand  control.  The  air  pollution  Situation   in\r\n\r\nSingapore has not deteriorated although  many  new\r\n\r\nfactories  have been established in the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a number of minor inadequacies have been\r\n\r\ndetected  in the course of implementation  of  the\r\n\r\nAct.  The  Clean  Air (Amendment)  Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\nrectify this situation so as to provide for better\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  air pollution and for more  effective\r\n\r\nenforcement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, construction sites often give rise to\r\n\r\nlocalised   air  pollution  resulting  in   public\r\n\r\ncomplaints, if activities such as the operation of\r\n\r\na  concrete  mixing plant and the open burning  of\r\n\r\nused  construction materials are carried out. Such\r\n\r\nactivities have to be controlled. This Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill   bring   construction   sites   within   the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of \"industrial or trade  premises\"  so\r\n\r\nthat  the Clean Air Act, 1971, will also apply  to\r\n\r\nthese sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In older industrial and trade premises, air\r\n\r\npollution  is often caused by the use of  obsolete\r\n\r\nand  inefficient methods of operation and process.\r\n\r\nTo  solve this, the occupiers of such premises may\r\n\r\nbe  required  to  change or alter the  methods  of\r\n\r\noperation or process to those involving  less  air\r\n\r\npollution.  In  other cases, the Director  of  Air\r\n\r\nPollution  Control may require  the  occupiers  to\r\n\r\ndismantle  or disconnect any industrial  plant  or\r\n\r\nequipment  which  are  found  to  cause  excessive\r\n\r\npollution.  The  Bill  will extend  the  scope  of\r\n\r\nrequirements  which  the Director  may  impose  to\r\n\r\ninclude those just mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the passing of the Prohibition on the Use\r\n\r\nof  Open Fires Order, 1973, the incidence of  open\r\n\r\nburning  in  Singapore has decreased tremendously.\r\n\r\nThis has helped to reduce low level air pollution.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in the enforcement, there has been  some\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in proving the charge of open  burning\r\n\r\nwithin  industrial and trade premises, as such  an\r\n\r\nact  is  usually committed by the occupier of  the\r\n\r\npremises  when  the enforcement officers  are  not\r\n\r\naround. To overcome this, the relevant section  in\r\n\r\nthe  Clean Air Act will be amended by including  a\r\n\r\npresumptive clause making the occupier responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the offence if open burning were to be  found\r\n\r\nin his premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many occupiers of existing industrial and\r\n\r\ntrade  premises have installed or plan to  install\r\n\r\nair  pollution control equipment, there  are  some\r\n\r\nrecalcitrants  who prefer to pay  the  fines  when\r\n\r\nbrought  to  court  rather  than  take  corrective\r\n\r\nmeasures. Sir, this is not desirable in the  long-term.  Therefore, it is necessary to  empower  the\r\n\r\nMagistrate's Court or District Court to impose the\r\n\r\nmaximum  penalty or punishment for offences  under\r\n\r\nthe  Clean  Air Act and Regulations, if the  fines\r\n\r\nwere to be a sufficient deterrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in seeking these amendments I would like to\r\n\r\nassure  that  a  balanced  approach,  taking  into\r\n\r\nconsideration not only the wider interests of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity but also the specific interests of other\r\n\r\nsectors, will continue to prevail as had been done\r\n\r\nin the implementation of the Clean Air Act, 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read\r\n\r\na Second time and committed to a Committee of the\r\n\r\nwhole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the BilI.-[Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

The\r\n\r\namendment  proposed in clause 2 of the  Bill  will\r\n\r\nempower the Registration Officer to omit from  the\r\n\r\nregisters  of  electors the names of  all  persons\r\n\r\nwhose  addresses  he has reason  to  believe  have\r\n\r\nceased  to  exist. This will ensure that  electors\r\n\r\nvoting  at  an election for a particular electoral\r\n\r\ndivision are the residents of that division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also empower the Minister to direct\r\n\r\nthe  Registration Officer to update the  registers\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelectors,   whenever   necessary.

The\r\n\r\nspirit  of  the  1971 Act has  been  retained  and\r\n\r\nreinforced by a number of innovations which I will\r\n\r\ndwell upon in greater detail later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any workmen's compensation scheme must\r\n\r\nprovide  for expeditious and adequate  payment  of\r\n\r\ncompensation. But the procedure laid down  in  the 1971  Act  has  been  found to be  time-consuming,\r\n\r\ncausing long and unnecessary delays in the payment\r\n\r\nof   compensation.  Under  the   1971   Act,   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Labour will assess the amount  of\r\n\r\ncompensation payable and this assessment  is  then\r\n\r\nsent  to the parties concerned. Since the Act does\r\n\r\nnot  provide for a time limit for the employer  to\r\n\r\neither  object  to the assessment or  to  pay  the\r\n\r\ncompensation, a great number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployers  have  in the past deliberately  ignored\r\n\r\nthe   notice  of  assessment.  It  is  only  after\r\n\r\nrepeated reminders that we get a response from the\r\n\r\nemployer.  The employer may further delay  payment\r\n\r\nof  compensation by disputing either the extent of\r\n\r\nhis liability to pay compensation or the extent of\r\n\r\ndependency of the claimants on the earnings of the\r\n\r\ndeceased  worker. Under the Act, full compensation\r\n\r\nis  payable only if there has been full dependency\r\n\r\nand  proportionate  payment if  there  is  partial\r\n\r\ndependency.  In either of the cases  that  I  have\r\n\r\njust  mentioned, an inquiry has to be held by  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for Labour which is  often  a  long-drawn  affair. If no agreement is reached  at  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  of  the inquiry, then the  dispute  is\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the  Arbitrator. More  time  elapses\r\n\r\nbefore the disputed case is finally settled by the\r\n\r\nArbitrator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in cases where there is no dispute over the\r\n\r\nassessed  quantum  and degree of  dependency,  the\r\n\r\nclaimants cannot be compensated immediately  until\r\n\r\na  Memorandum of Agreement has been signed by both\r\n\r\nparties.  Here  again,  the  employer  can   delay\r\n\r\npayment by not completing the Agreement. To  crown\r\n\r\nit  all, the Act requires that a waiting period of\r\n\r\nseven  days  be observed before the Memorandum  of\r\n\r\nAgreement can be registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the House will agree that\r\n\r\nthis long delay is not only undesirable in that it\r\n\r\nworks  to  the detriment of the injured worker  or\r\n\r\nhis dependants but wholly unnecessary. My Ministry\r\n\r\nhas   therefore  decided  to  replace  the   time-consuming   procedures  with  a  new   system   of\r\n\r\nadministration  and  enforcement   providing   for\r\n\r\nexpeditious  payment  of  workmen's  compensation.\r\n\r\nAlso in the new Bill dependency will no longer  be\r\n\r\na  bone  of  contention. The assessed compensation\r\n\r\nwill  be  paid in full regardless of  whether  the\r\n\r\ndependency is full or partial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has also found that the\r\n\r\nprovision  for  insurance coverage for  employer's\r\n\r\nliability  is unsatisfactory. Under the  1971  Act\r\n\r\nthe insurer is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired  to pay directly to the Commissioner  for\r\n\r\nLabour the assessed compensation on behalf of  the\r\n\r\nemployer.  My  Ministry has found  that  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies also often delayed payments, or in  some\r\n\r\ncases  even  refused  to pay,  on  the  ground  of\r\n\r\nalleged breach of insurance policies taken out  by\r\n\r\nthe  employers. The House might like to know  that\r\n\r\nin one case an insurance company took eight months\r\n\r\nto  investigate before informing the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nits  refusal to pay on grounds that the policy was\r\n\r\nunder-declared.  This Bill also  seeks  to  remedy\r\n\r\nthis situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the House is fully aware of the rise in the\r\n\r\ncost of living over the last few years as a result\r\n\r\nlargely  of  inflation originating from  overseas.\r\n\r\nThe  level of compensation payable under the  1971\r\n\r\nAct  is, however, not proportionate to the  margin\r\n\r\nof  increase  in  the  cost of  living  today.  My\r\n\r\nMinistry, therefore, has taken the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nincrease the quantum of workmen's compensation  in\r\n\r\nthe new Bill to a more realistic level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increased use of different types of\r\n\r\nchemicals,  resins and other irritating substances\r\n\r\nin  modem  production processes and the prevailing\r\n\r\nhigh  noise  levels  in industries  like  textile,\r\n\r\nshipbuilding    and    ship-repairing,    building\r\n\r\nconstruction  and  metal container  manufacturing,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry finds it necessary to add industrial\r\n\r\ndermatitis and noise-induced deafness to the  list\r\n\r\nof  diseases  for which workmen's compensation  is\r\n\r\npayable. The listing of these two diseases besides\r\n\r\nforming  part of our continuing efforts to improve\r\n\r\nthe  health and welfare of workers is also a  step\r\n\r\nforward  in  bringing our legislation more  up-to-date   and  in  line  with  present  day   working\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also taken the opportunity in the\r\n\r\nnew Bill to provide for the establishment of a new\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Fund. The objectives of  the  Fund  are,\r\n\r\ninter alia, to finance rehabilitation schemes  for\r\n\r\ninjured  workers  so  that  they  can  return   to\r\n\r\nproductive  labour and to finance  other  projects\r\n\r\nfor the general\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvancement   of  the  welfare   of   workers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  establishment of this  Fund  will\r\n\r\nunderline the importance we in our Republic attach\r\n\r\nto  the role workers play in our national economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  It  is  my hope  that,  once  it  is\r\n\r\nestablished, firms and other organisations will be\r\n\r\nforthcoming with their donations which will  enjoy\r\n\r\nexemption from income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Workmen's Compensation Act merely\r\n\r\ncompensates  but can never remove the  sorrow  and\r\n\r\nanguish   suffered   by  the  bereaved   families.\r\n\r\nImportant  and necessary as workmen's compensation\r\n\r\nis,   my  Ministry  is  more  concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nprevention   of  industrial  accidents.   As   our\r\n\r\nRepublic   develops  rapidly  towards   a   higher\r\n\r\nindustrial  and technological base, the  injection\r\n\r\nof   more   sophisticated   machineries   in   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector is unavoidable.  Consequently\r\n\r\nthe  methods  of production and material  handling\r\n\r\nhave also undergone revolutionary changes. Most of\r\n\r\nthe  industrial accidents occurred under these new\r\n\r\nworking  environments and exposures to machineries\r\n\r\nhitherto  unfamiliar  to  our  new  generation  of\r\n\r\nworkers.  In 1970, the total number of  industrial\r\n\r\nand  occupational accidents was 9,682. This figure\r\n\r\ngradually climbed to the peak of 13,094  in  1973,\r\n\r\nregistering  an increase of 35%. During  the  same\r\n\r\nperiod,  the amount of compensation paid out  also\r\n\r\nrecorded  an increase of 287.5% from $1.6  million\r\n\r\nto  nearly $6.2 million. In 1974 the total  number\r\n\r\nof accidents registered was 12,639, representing a\r\n\r\ndecline  of  455 cases or 3.5% over  the  previous\r\n\r\nyear.  However,  the number of  actual  fatalities\r\n\r\nregistered an increase of six cases or  3.8%  over\r\n\r\nthe  previous year's figure of 160. The amount  of\r\n\r\ncompensation  paid  out as at  December  1974  was\r\n\r\n$5,834,000  not including outstanding claims.  The\r\n\r\nfinal  figure for the year, therefore, might  well\r\n\r\nmatch  that of 1973. It can be seen that  although\r\n\r\nthe  overall number of accidents dropped  by  3.5%\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of compensation paid remained  almost\r\n\r\nthe same because there were more severe injury and\r\n\r\nfatal  cases.  As human resources  constitute  our\r\n\r\nonly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnatural resources, a special responsibility  rests\r\n\r\non  employers  to  maintain  a  safe  and  healthy\r\n\r\nworking  environment  and  to  ensure  that  their\r\n\r\nworkforce observe all the safety regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a legislation intended to\r\n\r\nprevent  accidents  or  to  offer  remedy  to  the\r\n\r\nproblems   of   safety  and  health   regulations.\r\n\r\nSeparate  legislation, principally  the  Factories\r\n\r\nAct  and  its subsidiary regulations,  will  cover\r\n\r\nthis  particular aspect. There should be no  doubt\r\n\r\nnow in the minds of everyone that nobody gains  in\r\n\r\nan   industrial  or  occupational  accident.   The\r\n\r\nemployer loses manhours and productivity, throwing\r\n\r\nproduction  line off-gear and upsetting production\r\n\r\nschedule;   the   insurance   company   loses   in\r\n\r\ncompensation,  but  most  important  of  all,  the\r\n\r\nworker  loses  his  life and his  family  loses  a\r\n\r\nbreadwinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the increase in the quantum of compensation\r\n\r\nunder this new Bill should not be looked upon as a\r\n\r\npunitive measure but rather an attempt to strike a\r\n\r\nreasonable  balance  between  the  needs  of   the\r\n\r\nvictims  and their families and what the  industry\r\n\r\ncan bear. The House may be interested to know that\r\n\r\nthe  contractors' organisations  and  the  General\r\n\r\nInsurance  Association, under the guidance  of  my\r\n\r\nMinistry's Building Construction Safety and Health\r\n\r\nCommittee,  are  now exploring the possibility  of\r\n\r\nworking  out a new incentive-orientated  insurance\r\n\r\nrebates  scheme. I hope that this will be extended\r\n\r\nto all other employers as there is more reason now\r\n\r\nto  have  this  incentive scheme in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nincrease in the quantum of compensation.  The  net\r\n\r\nresult can only be savings all round. As there are\r\n\r\nextensive  amendments and in view  of  the  Bill's\r\n\r\nimportance, it is proposed to commit the Bill to a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee of Parliament so that  views  of\r\n\r\nall interested parties can be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main provisions of this Amendment Bill\r\n\r\nare  detailed in the explanatory statement to this\r\n\r\nBill.  Let me now elaborate on some of the salient\r\n\r\nfeatures of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new provision establishes the Workers' Fund in\r\n\r\nclause 6 and pro-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvides  that  where  a  deceased  workman  has  no\r\n\r\ndependant, compensation is nevertheless payable to\r\n\r\nthe Workers' Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7, which is to be read with the Third\r\n\r\nSchedule,  provides for increased compensation  to\r\n\r\nan   injured  workman.  The  maximum  compensation\r\n\r\npayable  in  fatal  cases  has  been  raised  from\r\n\r\n$21,600  to  $35,000  and in permanent  incapacity\r\n\r\ncases   from  $28,800  to  $45,000.  In  temporary\r\n\r\nincapacity cases, from one-third wages paid  half-monthly to full wages for 14 days if there  is  no\r\n\r\nhospitalisation  and 60 days where hospitalisation\r\n\r\nis involved. To ensure that the injured worker and\r\n\r\nhis  dependants will in fact obtain the  increased\r\n\r\nquantum  of compensation, the multiplying  factors\r\n\r\nfor   computing   compensation  have   also   been\r\n\r\nincreased.  For  fatal cases, it  is  108  months'\r\n\r\nearnings  in the ease of a workman below 40  years\r\n\r\nof  age;  84  months' earnings in the  case  of  a\r\n\r\nworkman who is 40 years of age and above but below\r\n\r\n50  years of age; 72 months' earnings in the  case\r\n\r\nof a workman who is 50 years of age and above. For\r\n\r\npermanent  incapacity cases,  it  is  144  months'\r\n\r\nearnings in the case of a workman who is below  40\r\n\r\nyears of age; 120 months' earnings in the case  of\r\n\r\na  workman  who is 40 years of age and  above  but\r\n\r\nbelow 50 years of age; 96 months' earnings in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  a  workman who is 50 years  of  age  and\r\n\r\nabove. The percentages of loss of earnings used to\r\n\r\ncalculate  compensation  in  permanent  incapacity\r\n\r\ncases involving traumatic injuries have also  been\r\n\r\nrevised upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important feature of the Bill is the\r\n\r\nelimination of time-consuming procedures  and  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of a new system of administration and\r\n\r\nenforcement providing for expeditious  payment  of\r\n\r\nworkmen's compensation. This is achieved by clause\r\n\r\n24  of  the Bill. Under this clause, the employer,\r\n\r\nunless  he has grounds for objection, is  required\r\n\r\nto  deposit the assessed sum of compensation  with\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner for Labour within 21 days of the\r\n\r\nservice  of  the  notice  of  assessment.  If  the\r\n\r\nemployer fails to do so, an interest of 1\ufffd% per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonth  will be levied on the late payment.  If  he\r\n\r\ndisputes the assessment, in accordance with clause\r\n\r\n25  he  must state in writing the grounds  of  his\r\n\r\nobjection  to the Commissioner within 14  days  of\r\n\r\nthe  service  of  the notice. Where  the  employer\r\n\r\ndisputes  liability, under clause 25 of the  Bill,\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner is vested with the powers of the\r\n\r\nArbitrator  to hold a hearing and make  the  final\r\n\r\ndecision  on the case.

With that note, Sir, I rise in  support\r\n\r\nof the Workmen's Compensation Bill standing in the\r\n\r\nname of the Minister for Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to specially congratulate the Honourable\r\n\r\nMinister  for his wisdom and foresight to  include\r\n\r\nnoise-induced deafness as one of the  occupational\r\n\r\ndiseases  listed  in the Second  Schedule  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.   This,   in  my  view,  is  an  appropriate\r\n\r\ncomplement of section 58\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Part VII) of the Factories Act (No. 6 of 1973)\r\n\r\nwhich states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where in any factory persons are employed in any\r\n\r\nprocess  involving exposure to excessive noise  or\r\n\r\nvibration which may constitute a danger  to  their\r\n\r\nhealth effective means shall as far as practicable\r\n\r\nbe  provided  for the reduction of such  noise  or\r\n\r\nvibration'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  think,  Sir, the time is opportune  to  include\r\n\r\nbasic    requirements   on   noise   control    in\r\n\r\noccupational safety and health legislation.  There\r\n\r\nmay  be  authoritative codes of practice on  noise\r\n\r\ncontrol,  but  their influence,  sad  to  say,  is\r\n\r\nunlikely  to  have  a  sufficiently  rapid  effect\r\n\r\nunless underpinned by legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noise pollution, like air and water pollution, is\r\n\r\nlargely a consequence of the man-made environment,\r\n\r\nthe   result  of  the  application  of  technology\r\n\r\nwithout  first considering fully the  impact  upon\r\n\r\npeople.  To the extent that it is manmade,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot likely to go away, but will undoubtedly become\r\n\r\nmore  serious  unless  effective  strategies   are\r\n\r\ndeveloped for its control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this Bill and the\r\n\r\nenactment of the Factories Act of 1973, Singapore,\r\n\r\nlike  many  other industrialised and  high-density\r\n\r\nurban societies, is beginning to join battle  with\r\n\r\nnoise.  It is very encouraging to see that we  are\r\n\r\njoining  battle  before the  problem  reaches  the\r\n\r\nproportions  of a crisis. We are in  a  relatively\r\n\r\nearly  stage  of noise pollution and  any  control\r\n\r\nimposed now is therefore very timely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most technically well developed countries\r\n\r\nexhibit, or have exhibited for a number of  years,\r\n\r\na   degree  of  concern  towards  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nenvironmental noise. In the past decade or so,  an\r\n\r\nincreasing  number of countries  have  transformed\r\n\r\ntheir  concern  into  concrete action,  developing\r\n\r\nspecific methods for controlling the problem to  a\r\n\r\nsensible level. Of the arsenal of weapons at their\r\n\r\ndisposal, most of them have chosen the legislative\r\n\r\nprocess as their prime method of control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial noise has recently become a live issue\r\n\r\nin  the  field  of compensation. For instance,  in\r\n\r\nBritain  in 1971 an action for damages was brought\r\n\r\nby one F. R. Berry against his employers, Stone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManganese & Marine Ltd., for their alleged failure\r\n\r\nto  provide adequate protection against  excessive\r\n\r\nnoise  in a chipping workshop. As a result of  his\r\n\r\nwork,  Berry's hearing deteriorated  gravely.  The\r\n\r\njudgment was that the employers were negligent  in\r\n\r\nfailing  to supply ear-muffs to him when he  first\r\n\r\nstarted   in  the  industry.  The  plaintiff   was\r\n\r\naccordingly awarded \ufffd1,250. In this respect,  Sir,\r\n\r\nI am glad to note that the amount of compensation,\r\n\r\nas  detailed  under  the  Third  Schedule  of  the\r\n\r\nWorkmen's  Compensation Bill, in the  case  of  an\r\n\r\ninjury causing the loss of hearing of one ear is\r\n\r\n30%  of  the  compensation which would  have  been\r\n\r\npayable in the case of permanent total incapacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few countries provide stiff penalties for\r\n\r\nnon-compliance  with the law. Certainly  penalties\r\n\r\ndo  not seem to be framed in terms of criminal and\r\n\r\ncivil punishments; rather fines are levied on  the\r\n\r\noffender. Perhaps the stiffest penalties are to be\r\n\r\nfound  in  the USA where non-compliance  with  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the Occupational Safety and Health\r\n\r\nAct  can  result  in  fines up to  US$10,000  and,\r\n\r\nindeed, in the worst case, in the possible  forced\r\n\r\nclosing  down  of a plant. And, if  the  plant  in\r\n\r\nquestion  falls  under  the  Walsh-Healey   Public\r\n\r\nContracts  Act,  the Company in  question  may  be\r\n\r\ndenied the right to bid on US Government contracts\r\n\r\nfor a period of up to three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some exceptions. Sir, countries that are\r\n\r\nnow tackling the problem of noise-induced deafness\r\n\r\ndefine a noise criterion equivalent to 90dB (A) as\r\n\r\na  standard which must be met over the course of a\r\n\r\nworking day if undue risk of damage to hearing  is\r\n\r\nto  be  avoided. A notable exception is  the  USSR\r\n\r\nwhich  defines  a - noise criterion equivalent  to\r\n\r\n85dB  (A).  And, a still more remarkable exception\r\n\r\nis France which, in a decree of April 1969, stated\r\n\r\nthat  a  noise  level of 80dB (A)  should  not  be\r\n\r\nexceeded in all factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is generally made, too, for the\r\n\r\neffects of impulsive noise. Here, the various laws\r\n\r\nexisting  today  tend to differ considerably,  but\r\n\r\nthis, however, is an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindication  of  the  less than adequate  state  of\r\n\r\nknowledge  in  this  area. In another  action  for\r\n\r\ndamages, in Great Britain, for example, a  certain\r\n\r\nW.   Derby   was  awarded  \ufffd27,000   against   his\r\n\r\nemployers,  Short Brothers & Harland, for  causing\r\n\r\nhis  instantaneous deafness. A  weapon  was  being\r\n\r\nfired  which  deafened the man instantly.  It  was\r\n\r\nstated   that  if  there  had  not  been   a   10%\r\n\r\ncontributory negligence, the plaintiff would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  awarded  \ufffd30,000. The same accident  in  the\r\n\r\nAustralian  Capital Territory would have  entitled\r\n\r\nthe  plaintiff to a maximum claim of A$9,450 while\r\n\r\nin  Queensland  (Australia), he would,  under  the\r\n\r\nQueensland Workers' Compensation Act, be awarded a\r\n\r\nmeagre A$5,330.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also my opinion that the measurement\r\n\r\nof  the hearing levels of each employee likely  to\r\n\r\nbe  exposed to excessive noise forms an  essential\r\n\r\npart  of  a  hearing conservation  programme,  and\r\n\r\nshould  be practised by all `noisy' industries  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. These tests should be carried out by  a\r\n\r\nmedical practitioner who is able to interpret  the\r\n\r\nresults  in conjunction with a medical history  of\r\n\r\neach   individual   and  a   knowledge   of   that\r\n\r\nindividual's work environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audiometric tests should be made at the\r\n\r\ncommencement    of   the   hearing    conservation\r\n\r\nprogramme,  repeated  in  three  months  from  the\r\n\r\ncommencement, and thence every six  months  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  two  to three years depending  on  the\r\n\r\nnoise environment, and then annually. In this way,\r\n\r\nthe  success  of the programme can be measured  by\r\n\r\ndemonstrating that no further loss of  hearing  is\r\n\r\noccurring  in any exposed workman. These  periodic\r\n\r\ntests  also detect the occasional employee who  is\r\n\r\nmore susceptible to noise than the average person,\r\n\r\nor   the  employee  who  is  receiving  inadequate\r\n\r\nprotection due to poor-fitting ear plugs or muffs,\r\n\r\nor failing to use the protection supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tests should also be made on each new employee\r\n\r\nas part of a engagement examination at the time of\r\n\r\nengagement. Pre-existing ear disease or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeafness  may  make it desirable to  place  a  new\r\n\r\nemployee in a less noisy environment for  his  own\r\n\r\nsake.  Replacement examination  and  testing  also\r\n\r\nprovides  opportunity to educate the new  employee\r\n\r\nin  the  hazards  associated with excessive  noise\r\n\r\nexposure and to provide him with ear protectors if\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of personal hearing protective\r\n\r\nequipment,   I   wish  to  stress  to   industries\r\n\r\ncontemplating using them that they be used only as\r\n\r\na  last resort, when there is no apparent feasible\r\n\r\nmeans   of   controlling   industrial   noise   by\r\n\r\nengineering or administrative processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When introducing personal hearing protection\r\n\r\ndevices,  it  is  important to  ensure  that  both\r\n\r\nmanagement and employees have a full and  thorough\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the aims of and the need for  the\r\n\r\nprogramme. If hasty decisions are made or  if  the\r\n\r\nprogramme   is  presented  to  employees   without\r\n\r\nadequately  preparing them for participation,  co-operation   is  difficult  to  achieve.   My   own\r\n\r\nobservations,  Sir, have shown  that  insufficient\r\n\r\nefforts, on the part of the employers, to  educate\r\n\r\nemployees    have,   in   the   past,    led    to\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  of  the  employer's  motive  and\r\n\r\nobjectives,  to  discontent and  to  the  eventual\r\n\r\nrejection  of  the protection. My message  to  the\r\n\r\nemployers is: they are under a duty to take  steps\r\n\r\nby  propaganda and persuasion to see that  hearing\r\n\r\nprotection equipment is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the objective of safety and health\r\n\r\nlegislation is to safeguard life and limb  and  to\r\n\r\npromote health. But the mere enactment of words on\r\n\r\nthe  statute  book will by no means  achieve  this\r\n\r\nresult.  In the final analysis, everything depends\r\n\r\non  the  actions  of the individual  people  -both\r\n\r\nmanagement and employees. Major reliance  must  be\r\n\r\nplaced  upon  line  managers  or  supervisors   to\r\n\r\ncontrol the day-to-day performance of the work. It\r\n\r\nis  essential, therefore, that members of the line\r\n\r\nmanagement are able to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunderstand  their legal duties and act upon  them.\r\n\r\nSafety   officers  and  specialists,   Sir,   have\r\n\r\nimportant roles to play, but they cannot be  ever-present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, the Bill before the House is more modern and\r\n\r\nprogressive than the existing law.

UPI and  ASP.  In\r\n\r\nthe  agreement between the Broadcasting Department\r\n\r\nand  the news agency for the supply of news, there\r\n\r\nis  a  clause,  which  is  standard  in  all  such\r\n\r\nAgreements, that although the news agency will  do\r\n\r\nits  utmost  to  ensure the  accuracy  and  prompt\r\n\r\ndelivery  of  its news service, it will,  however,\r\n\r\nnot  be  liable  for any loss  or  damage  to  the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting Department as a result of any  error,\r\n\r\nomission  or  inaccuracy on the part of  the  news\r\n\r\nagency.

Once a person has obtained a certificate\r\n\r\nfor  marriage or a licence, he is free to have his\r\n\r\nmarriage  solemnised in accordance with  the  law,\r\n\r\nreligion, customs or usage of the parties  or  any\r\n\r\nof  the  parties to the marriage by an  authorised\r\n\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family is the basic social institution. The\r\n\r\nway  families are started through marriage and the\r\n\r\nstability of family life have far-reaching  social\r\n\r\nconsequences  in  any  society.  The   Government,\r\n\r\ntherefore, takes a serious view of the contracting\r\n\r\nof \"marriages\" which are void. Since the beginning\r\n\r\nof  1974, action has been taken against those  who\r\n\r\nare   found  to  have  contracted  void  marriages\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the  requirements  of  the   Women's\r\n\r\nCharter. An educational and publicity campaign has\r\n\r\nalso  been conducted to make it known that  it  is\r\n\r\nthe obtaining of a certificate or a licence before\r\n\r\na   customary   marriage  is  solemnised   by   an\r\n\r\nauthorised person and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  solemnisation of a marriage by the  Registrar\r\n\r\nthat gives a marriage legal validity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1973, a grace period was given to\r\n\r\ncouples   who  had  contracted  invalid  customary\r\n\r\nmarriages  to  have  their  \"marriages\"   properly\r\n\r\nsolemnised at the Registry of Marriages. A  record\r\n\r\nnumber  of  11,479 couples responded. Many  people\r\n\r\ncontract   void  marriages  by  contravening   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Women's Charter. A void marriage\r\n\r\nis  no  marriage at all. It is regarded  as  never\r\n\r\nhaving  taken  place.  By virtue  of  section  93,\r\n\r\nsubsection (2), of the Women's Charter, the  child\r\n\r\nof  a void \"marriage\" is deemed to be a legitimate\r\n\r\nchild  of  his  or  her  parents,  and  under  our\r\n\r\ncitizenship laws, if any one of his or her parents\r\n\r\nis  a  Singapore  citizen, he or  she  is  also  a\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizen.  The  child   born   out   of\r\n\r\ncohabitation or out of wedlock is not a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen  unless his or her mother is  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen.  Since a void marriage is no marriage  in\r\n\r\nlaw,  the child of a void marriage should  acquire\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship on the  same  basis  as  an\r\n\r\nillegitimate  child. It is not  desirable  that  a\r\n\r\nchild  whose parents knowingly contracted  a  void\r\n\r\nmarriage  should qualify for Singapore citizenship\r\n\r\nmore  easily than an illegitimate child. So, under\r\n\r\nthe  new provision, if a man and a woman marry and\r\n\r\nthey  both know that their marriage is not a valid\r\n\r\none,   their  children  will  be  deemed   to   be\r\n\r\nillegitimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change is particularly necessary in our\r\n\r\nsocial  situation as there are work permit holders\r\n\r\nwho  are  required  to seek the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Employment before they contract a\r\n\r\nmarriage  with  a  Singapore  citizen.  Some  work\r\n\r\npermit  holders are circumventing this requirement\r\n\r\nby  contracting customary marriages  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nknowing  full well that such marriages  contracted\r\n\r\non  or  after 2nd June, 1967, are void. Under  the\r\n\r\nexisting  law,  the  children born  of  such  void\r\n\r\nmarriages  are  deemed legitimate  and  they  will\r\n\r\nacquire Singapore citizenship on the same basis as\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegitimate child acquires Singapore citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A marriage can be void for a number of reasons,\r\n\r\nsuch as when one partner is underage or is already\r\n\r\nmarried.   Under   the  proposed  amendment,   the\r\n\r\nchildren of such marriages would be deemed  to  be\r\n\r\nlegitimate, because under the new provision,  both\r\n\r\nor  either  of  the  parents may  have  reasonably\r\n\r\nbelieved that the marriage was valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the other amendment to the Women's\r\n\r\nCharter introduced in this Bill. A new section 168\r\n\r\nwill  be  added to the Women's Charter to make  it\r\n\r\nclear  that  the  customary  marriages  contracted\r\n\r\nbefore  2nd June, 1967, will continue to be valid,\r\n\r\nso  long as they do not contravene section 4 or 10\r\n\r\nof  the Women's Charter in force at that time.
