We started 1975 with the United  States\r\n\r\nand  Western  Europe easing credit to  avoid  more  un\r\n\r\nemployment   and  deepening  recession.   Japan   will\r\n\r\nprobably  do likewise later in the year. Singapore  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  reverse the downtrend in her economy.  Our\r\n\r\neconomy will probably do better in the second half  of\r\n\r\nthis year than in the first half.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not fared too badly last year, with real\r\n\r\ngrowth  around 7%. Two rough indicators are  usage  of\r\n\r\nour  harbour  and  airport. General  and  bulk  cargo,\r\n\r\nexcluding  bunker  fuel,  handled  by  the   Port   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Authority  increased  in  volume   by   4%.\r\n\r\nAircraft  arrivals  and departures increased  by  less\r\n\r\nthan 1% in 1974. But passengers increased by 9%.  Thus\r\n\r\nthe world and Singapore adjusted to higher fuel prices\r\n\r\nand higher fares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans cannot expect to enjoy real growth\r\n\r\nrates of 10-12% which lasted for over five years up to\r\n\r\n1973. The Japanese, who achieved 12-15% growth for the\r\n\r\ndecade  before the energy crisis, now plan for  a  4~%\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate. If our growth rates are between  5%  and\r\n\r\n7%,  it is because we have a lower base from which  to\r\n\r\nclimb up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided there is no war and another oil embargo or\r\n\r\nother  major catastrophe, Singaporeans will adjust  to\r\n\r\nslower\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ngrowth  rates.  This  is one of the  advantages  of  a\r\n\r\nrelatively young population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our birth rates continued to fall in 1974. Experts\r\n\r\nhad predicted more births\r\n\r\nbecause  of  more young people entering the  fertility\r\n\r\nage group. But, in fact, total births declined in 1974\r\n\r\nto 44,000 from 48,000 in 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the problems of the old will grow\r\n\r\nmore  difficult as young families leave out their aged\r\n\r\nparents  when they move into flats. Already, over  one\r\n\r\nmillion people, or more than 45%, live in Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  estates. Last year,  26,000  homes\r\n\r\nwere  completed. My Government will take  measures  to\r\n\r\nmake  it  more  attractive for young couples  to  have\r\n\r\ntheir  parents  live with them. If nothing  else,  the\r\n\r\ngrandparents  help in bringing up the children  whilst\r\n\r\nfather and mother are at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more pressing problem is travelling at peak hours.\r\n\r\nOnce  we  live in high-rise and work in high-rise,  we\r\n\r\nhave increased the density of traffic between the home\r\n\r\nand  office.  And when so many. want to get  into  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Business  District at  the  same  time,  then\r\n\r\ntraffic jams at peak hours are. inevitable. Fringe car\r\n\r\nparking  will  have to be made to work,  to  free  the\r\n\r\nroads  in  the  Central  Business  District  for  more\r\n\r\nefficient use by public passenger vehicles. Peak  hour\r\n\r\ntravelling  times and the charges for  entry  will  be\r\n\r\nadjusted  to  give  maximum room for public  passenger\r\n\r\nvehicles.   The   bus  service  is   improving.   More\r\n\r\nimprovement  can  be  made in another  three  to  five\r\n\r\nyears.  In  the late 1980's the beginnings of  a  Mass\r\n\r\nRapid Transit may lessen this congestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One beneficial side effect of the energy crisis is a\r\n\r\nslowdown   in  the  number  of  new  cars  registered.\r\n\r\nHowever,  within  a few years, car manufacturers  will\r\n\r\ndesign   lighter  cars  with  more  economic  engines,\r\n\r\ncheaper  to buy and cheaper to run. So it is necessary\r\n\r\nto  be vigilant and to adjust road and petrol taxes to\r\n\r\nprevent our roads from over-congestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem Honourable Members will have to\r\n\r\ntackle is the growing\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrime  rates.  High crime rates used to correspond  to\r\n\r\nhigh  unemployment rates. This is no  longer  true.  A\r\n\r\ngeneration is growing up that does not know what it is\r\n\r\nto  be  unemployed. They get jobs easily, despite  the\r\n\r\nslowdown  in  world trade and in Singapore's  economy.\r\n\r\nThey want the good things in life, but without working\r\n\r\nto  pay for them. On the other hand, the police  force\r\n\r\nis undermanned. My Government will introduce full-time\r\n\r\nNational  Service for the police force. In  this  way,\r\n\r\nthe  manpower shortage will be lessened. We shall also\r\n\r\nhave  people in the reserve police service living  all\r\n\r\nover  Singapore. They will enlarge our  law  enforcing\r\n\r\ncapacity.  We  must catch criminals and  punish  them.\r\n\r\nMore severe punishment must be meted out, most of  all\r\n\r\nto drug traffickers on whom any mercy is misplaced. We\r\n\r\nmust  make Singapore a safe and orderly place to  live\r\n\r\nin.  And this we can achieve because we have a  people\r\n\r\nresponsive to their collective needs, a public service\r\n\r\nand  police  force  not tainted by corruption,  and  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  prepared to take action before things  get\r\n\r\nout of hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary duty of government is to establish a\r\n\r\nsociety in which everyone has an equal chance to live,\r\n\r\nlearn, train,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwork  and earn to the best of his or her ability.  We\r\n\r\nshall  complete 16 years of representative  government\r\n\r\nthis  June. Our population growth went down from  4.0%\r\n\r\nin  1959  to  1.5%  in 1974. On the  other  hand,  our\r\n\r\nexternal  reserves have grown 20 times,  from  a  mere\r\n\r\n$336  million in June 1959 to over $6+ billion on  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1975.

At the same time, we will not overlook  other\r\n\r\nsectors  of  the economy such as construction,  trade,\r\n\r\ntourism, transportation and other service industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spare construction capacity and labour now available\r\n\r\nwill  be  used  to expand our physical  assets.

A sizeable contribution averaging $500 million\r\n\r\nannually  is  being made from the Main Budget  to  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Budget. But with a less buoyant  economy,\r\n\r\nexisting  tax revenues may not be sufficient  to  meet\r\n\r\ncapital needs. We may therefore have to draw upon  the\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange  reserves we have  built  up.
