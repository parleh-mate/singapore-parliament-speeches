Surgical\r\n\r\nimplants,  including  stents, are eligible  for  Medisave\r\n\r\nclaims as part of the total hospital bill, subject to the\r\n\r\ndaily  withdrawal limit of $300.  Implants  can  also  be\r\n\r\nclaimed  under MediShield and Medisave-approved insurance\r\n\r\nschemes,  where the maximum amount claimable ranges  from\r\n\r\n$1,500  to  $3,500, in addition to other claims  such  as\r\n\r\nroom   and   board  and  surgery  procedures.   Together,\r\n\r\nMedisave  and MediShield can cover more than 80%  of  the\r\n\r\naverage  B2  patient  bill  for  a  coronary  angioplasty\r\n\r\nprocedure involving stent implants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health, however, recognises that the\r\n\r\ncosts  of  implants vary considerably, depending  on  the\r\n\r\ntype  of  medical  condition  treated.   Therefore,   the\r\n\r\ncurrent Medisave withdrawal limits and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMediShield claimable limits may not fully cater  for  the\r\n\r\nwide  range  in  costs between treatments  for  different\r\n\r\nmedical conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this, the Ministry will reset the\r\n\r\nMedisave   withdrawal  limits  and  MediShield  Claimable\r\n\r\nlimits for inpatient and day surgery cases to be based on\r\n\r\nDiagnosis-Related-Groups (DRGs)  next  year.   This  will\r\n\r\nbetter   reflect  the  resources  needed  to  treat   the\r\n\r\ndifferent medical conditions, and will allow patients  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  or claim more from Medisave or MediShield,  for\r\n\r\nmedical conditions that are on the average more expensive\r\n\r\nto   treat.   Under  this  new  structure,  Medisave  and\r\n\r\nMediShield  would be able to fully cover  the  bills  for\r\n\r\nmost  subsidised patients undergoing coronary angioplasty\r\n\r\nprocedures  with  stent implants.  The price  of  medical\r\n\r\ntechnology  like  stents  can vary  greatly  and  equally\r\n\r\neffective   stents   can   be   priced   differently   by\r\n\r\nmanufacturers.   If  a  patient wants  a  more  expensive\r\n\r\nstent,  Medisave and MediShield will not fully cover  the\r\n\r\npatient's bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister whether the stent insertion  procedure\r\n\r\nthat  can  be  done  in a day surgery be  applicable  for\r\n\r\nMedisave application as well?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The answer is yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether the review, where the payment  will  be\r\n\r\nbased  on  diagnosis-related  illnesses,  will  still  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  a  maximum claim amount.  The  Minister  did\r\n\r\nmention  that  the  costs  of the  stents  vary.   To  my\r\n\r\nknowledge,  very often, the patient does not have  enough\r\n\r\nunderstanding to know what the cost of the best  kind  of\r\n\r\nstent  that is necessary for an angioplasty procedure  is\r\n\r\nand, therefore, would take advice from the doctors.   So,\r\n\r\nthe cost of the procedure and the stent is something that\r\n\r\nis  very  much  not within the control  of  the  patient.\r\n\r\nCould the Minister therefore consider that point as well?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member\r\n\r\nhas raised three related issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue, as I explained, is the way we\r\n\r\nstructure the withdrawal limits of the claims.  Today, it\r\n\r\nis  a  very  blunt instrument where we have  a  table  of\r\n\r\noperations with seven categories.  When we change over to\r\n\r\nthe  DRGs  next  year,  this will be  a  more  responsive\r\n\r\nsystem, with over 600 categories.  So, the claims will be\r\n\r\nmore related to the type of medical treatment undertaken.\r\n\r\nBut that alone will not solve the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is what is the withdrawal limit\r\n\r\nthat  we allow.  As long as we have Medisave, which is  a\r\n\r\ncompulsory  savings scheme, it cannot be a  free-for-all.\r\n\r\nSo,  the  Ministry will continue to set some  kind  of  a\r\n\r\nmaximum, because the whole idea of Medisave is to be able\r\n\r\nto   provide  savings  for  the  future  medical   needs,\r\n\r\nespecially when one grows old.  So, we cannot allow  free\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  Medisave.  There will continue to  be  some\r\n\r\nlimits.  Of course, we will review these limits regularly\r\n\r\nto make sure they keep up with the medical technology and\r\n\r\nchanges in medical procedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue is how do we address very expensive\r\n\r\nmedical devices and medical technology.  What we have  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health is a procedure by which we review\r\n\r\nwhat  are considered standard treatment, standard devices\r\n\r\nand  standard drugs.  These will be subsidised and  these\r\n\r\nare  the kinds of things for which we will allow Medisave\r\n\r\nto be withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical technology changes very rapidly, and there\r\n\r\nwill be non-standard procedures, non-standard devices and\r\n\r\nnon-standard  drugs.   So, how do we  address  this?   We\r\n\r\ncould  take a very strict approach and say, \"If they  are\r\n\r\nnon-standard, they will not be allowed in our  hospitals.\r\n\r\nIf  you  want,  you  will  have  to  go  to  the  private\r\n\r\nhospitals.\"  Or we could take a more liberal approach and\r\n\r\noffer  the patient some choice, eg, \"This is the standard\r\n\r\nthat   we   will   subsidise  and  will  allow   Medisave\r\n\r\nwithdrawals, but if you want a non-standard drug or non-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandard device, then you will have to pay the full  cost\r\n\r\nof  that\", in which case, we must make sure that there is\r\n\r\nproper   financial  counselling  and  that  the   patient\r\n\r\nunderstands  what  he  is in for.  On  the  ground,  with\r\n\r\nthousands of such operations, there could be lapses,  and\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  the kind of cases that the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nraised, ie, where the patient may not understand that  by\r\n\r\nselecting  a  particular stent, he is  selecting  a  very\r\n\r\nexpensive  one that costs $6,000 and, later on,  when  he\r\n\r\nhas  to  pay for it in cash, he then finds that he cannot\r\n\r\nafford it.  This is the kind of issue we have to address.\r\n\r\nWe  are reviewing this and we will lay out the parameters\r\n\r\nsometime next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether it is\r\n\r\ncorrect to say that the stent insertion procedure is used\r\n\r\nto   treat   ischemic   heart  disease   and   myocardial\r\n\r\ninfarction,   and  these  two  conditions  caused   3,243\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  die last year, and the  second  highest\r\n\r\nincidents of deaths in Singapore?  In view of this  fact,\r\n\r\nwill  his Ministry prioritise and allow patients to  have\r\n\r\nfull claim from Medisave or even subsidised for such life-saving procedures?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Stent is almost used as a\r\n\r\nstandard device nowadays, and if you are admitted as a B2\r\n\r\npatient  and the average stay perhaps is four  days,  the\r\n\r\naverage  B2 patient bill for such a procedure is  $4,600.\r\n\r\nThe  total amount that can be withdrawn from Medisave and\r\n\r\nMediShield  is  about $4,000 or 86%.   So,  you  pay  the\r\n\r\nbalance  in  cash.   If you go for a  standard  procedure\r\n\r\ninvolving  standard stents, our current rules  allow  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal which is about 86%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem arises when the patient chooses a top-of-the-market stent which costs $6,000, as is the case which\r\n\r\nI  understood from Mdm Halimah.  In that case, he had two\r\n\r\nstents, which cost $12,000.  This is obviously way beyond\r\n\r\nthe  Medisave  limit.   This is a non-standard  procedure\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  he was asked to pay cash.   How  do  we\r\n\r\naddress this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said in my answer, we could say that such\r\n\r\nthings are not allowed in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrestructured  hospitals.

An integral  part  of  the\r\n\r\nsyllabus  is the students' exposure to a wide variety  of\r\n\r\ntexts  appropriate to their needs.  This means  that  our\r\n\r\nstudents  would have adequate opportunities to  read  and\r\n\r\nsee  how  language  is used in various  texts,  including\r\n\r\nnarratives,  and  to  arrive at conclusions  about  story\r\n\r\nlines, events and characters.  While literature is not  a\r\n\r\nsubject in the upper primary curriculum, our children are\r\n\r\nencouraged  to read and such programmes are pervasive  in\r\n\r\nour   primary   schools  and  are  often   conducted   in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with our partners in education such  as  the\r\n\r\nNational Library Board and parent volunteers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the introduction of Literature into the\r\n\r\npolytechnic   curriculum  as  a  compulsory   polytechnic\r\n\r\ncurriculum, our polytechnics are geared towards providing\r\n\r\na  curriculum that prepares their students for employment\r\n\r\nopportunities in industry. Their curriculum is constantly\r\n\r\nreviewed  and  customised  to meet  the  requirements  of\r\n\r\nindustry.  Besides this focus, the polytechnics do  offer\r\n\r\na  balanced  and well-rounded education.   This  is  done\r\n\r\nthrough including subject modules in the curriculum  that\r\n\r\nprovide  their students with a creative outlook  and  the\r\n\r\nability to exercise and apply critical thinking in  their\r\n\r\nwork.

I think if you look at  the\r\n\r\nusage  of English Language in Singapore and you  look  at\r\n\r\nthe  top 5% of English speakers and you compare them with\r\n\r\nthe  top 5% of the population 20 years ago, I think  they\r\n\r\nare  comparable.   If  you  go  down  to  15-20%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation,  they  are  speaking  English   today.    But\r\n\r\nprobably  when  you  get  down  to  about  20%   of   the\r\n\r\npopulation, they were not speaking English 20 years  ago.\r\n\r\nIf  you  get  down  to  50% of the population,  they  are\r\n\r\nspeaking English today, not perfect English, not the  way\r\n\r\nthe Member speaks English or the Member would like others\r\n\r\nto   speak   English,  but  they  are  speaking  English.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the English that we hear today, because it  is\r\n\r\nbeing  spoken  by a much wider spectrum of  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nwho  might never have spoken English before, on  average,\r\n\r\nmay  be  lower.   But the English level in  Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nthink, is indeed higher than it was 20 years ago.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Syariah Court\r\n\r\nstarted    issuing    its   summonses,   correspondences,\r\n\r\ndocuments, decrees and orders in English in August  1999.\r\n\r\nPrior to that, such documents were issued in Malay.   The\r\n\r\nswitch  was made for the benefit of divorcees who  needed\r\n\r\nto submit the documents for various applications to other\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies such as the CPF  Board,  Immigration\r\n\r\nand  HDB.  Before the switch, divorcees had to go to  the\r\n\r\nSupreme  Court to translate the documents from  Malay  to\r\n\r\nEnglish for a fee.  This meant that such families had  to\r\n\r\nincur  additional costs, suffer inconvenience and  delay.\r\n\r\nThe present arrangement serves the interests of divorcees\r\n\r\nbetter.   It  saves  them time and they  need  not  incur\r\n\r\nadditional costs for translations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although important documents such as Court orders\r\n\r\nare  printed in English, the proceedings of the Court are\r\n\r\nalways conducted in either Malay or English, depending on\r\n\r\nwhat  the  divorcees themselves are conversant in.   Very\r\n\r\noften,  simultaneous interpreters for Tamil,  English  or\r\n\r\nother  languages are used to assist parties  who  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  Malay or English.  In cases  where  there  is\r\n\r\nmore than one language chosen, the Court will conduct the\r\n\r\nproceedings  in  either language and an interpreter  will\r\n\r\nsimultaneously interpret into the other language.

I  think  we would have painted ourselves  in  a\r\n\r\ncorner  if we had worked on that principle.  Yes,  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to raise families when you want to juggle  that\r\n\r\nwith  your  work  commitments.   Yes,  it  is  also  more\r\n\r\nexpensive  to  hire local help.  But we have  to  balance\r\n\r\nthis  with  the  increasing number  of  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers  that we have already seen.  From the  moratorium\r\n\r\nlast  time,  the number of maids has increased  by  about\r\n\r\n20%,  so  much so that one in eight households  currently\r\n\r\nhave   a  foreign  domestic  worker.   There  are  social\r\n\r\nrepercussions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we can do is to continue to provide and expand\r\n\r\ndomestic  service  as affordable alternatives  for  local\r\n\r\nhouseholds.  For  example, the CDCs, in  particular,  the\r\n\r\nSoutheast CDC has piloted training emplacement programmes\r\n\r\nfor  various domestic services.  These include  cleaning,\r\n\r\nlaundry,  child  care or eldercare.  In line  with  these\r\n\r\nefforts,  we  will  need to maintain a  FDW  levy  at  an\r\n\r\nappropriate level to moderate household demand for  FDWs.\r\n\r\nBut   whether   this  would  satisfy  the   majority   of\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  and  whether this  would  be  an  attractive\r\n\r\noption remains to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  seen and is relative.

As I have said, the moratorium continues  to\r\n\r\nstand  and when we do review the levy, we will take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration these factors and decide then whether there\r\n\r\nshould be an increase of the levy or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> As the Minister of State has\r\n\r\nobserved, the number of foreign workers has continued  to\r\n\r\nrise  despite the levies.

The  levy  is not a perfect  solution.   Other\r\n\r\ncountries  have tried other means.

No  country  has  a large proportion  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  as  Singapore  does.   We  are  second  only  to\r\n\r\nLuxembourg,  and I assure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou  that  the  character of the  proportion  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  in  Luxembourg is quite different from  what  we\r\n\r\nhave  in Singapore.

Do\r\n\r\nwe  know  when we will reach breaking point?  We do  not.\r\n\r\nHave  we  crossed it?  I do not know.  It has  just  been\r\n\r\nincreasing.

If the talk is held at an outdoor venue,  the\r\n\r\ntalk can attract large crowds and curious bystanders.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeeches   can  become  inflammatory,  thereby  eliciting\r\n\r\ndisaffection.  People of different political persuasions,\r\n\r\nreligious inclinations or racial groups in the crowd  may\r\n\r\nhurl  abuse;  first, verbal and then  physical,  at  each\r\n\r\nother.   In  other  words,  a  public  talk  on  even  an\r\n\r\ninnocuous topic may become unruly or degenerate into  mob\r\n\r\nviolence, if troublemakers are at work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a small, compact, multi-racial and\r\n\r\nmulti-religious country.  Past events show how easily  it\r\n\r\nis  for troublemakers to make use of gatherings to incite\r\n\r\nracial  and religious riots, resulting in loss  of  lives\r\n\r\nand  property.   Indeed, events over the last  two  years\r\n\r\naround  the world demonstrate the disruptive forces  that\r\n\r\ncan  be  unleashed  due to racial and  religious  strife.\r\n\r\nRegulation  of  public talks is therefore  necessary  and\r\n\r\ncontinues to be needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, MHA proactively reviews the\r\n\r\nlicensing laws under its purview and has relaxed rules on\r\n\r\npublic talks.  For example, in September 2000, we set  up\r\n\r\na  Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park.  Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nwho  wish to express their opinions on any issue,  except\r\n\r\nreligious speeches and speeches that would cause feelings\r\n\r\nof   enmity,   hatred,  ill-will  or  hostility   between\r\n\r\ndifferent  racial  or religious groups,  merely  need  to\r\n\r\nregister  their  intent to speak at the Kreta  Ayer  NPP,\r\n\r\nwhich is located next to the Speakers' Corner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PEMA is administered with a light touch.\r\n\r\nThe   facts  speak  for  themselves.   Between  2001  and\r\n\r\nNovember  2002,  Police approved 1,341  applications  and\r\n\r\nrejected only 5 applications for public talks.  That is a\r\n\r\nhigh  approval  rate  of  99.6%.  The  applications  were\r\n\r\nrejected  because  inadequate  time  was  given  by   the\r\n\r\napplicant  for  Police to process the application  before\r\n\r\nthe event, or the venue was not suitable for the talks to\r\n\r\nbe held.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although Singapore is becoming a more open\r\n\r\nsociety,  regulation of public talks is still  necessary.\r\n\r\nIn  any  case, the provisions under PEMA are  not  overly\r\n\r\nrestrictive and the regulation of public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalks  is administered with a light touch.

More likely, greater\r\n\r\nstress  will  be  faced not so much by  the  top  10%  of\r\n\r\nstudents,  but  the Mr and Ms Average and  the  Slightly-Above-Average in the JCs.  But how stressed they will end\r\n\r\nup  depends very much on how the subjects are taught, and\r\n\r\nhow  the  students approach the subjects  and  their  own\r\n\r\nexpectations  and that of their parents'.  We  know  from\r\n\r\nour  own experience, that if you enjoy a subject, it will\r\n\r\ncease to be stressful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if the broader based education curriculum\r\n\r\ndoes  prove  to be more stressful for some  students,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  ask ourselves which would be more stressful  in\r\n\r\nthe final analysis.  To be stretched a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfew  years  in  school with a broad based education  that\r\n\r\nprepares them well for the future, or to come out to  the\r\n\r\nworkforce  ill-equipped  for the lifetime  of  challenges\r\n\r\nahead?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern - whether this would make for a\r\n\r\nmore  elitist system - is to my mind the wrong  question.\r\n\r\nThe question to ask is:  with this education reform, will\r\n\r\nthe masses in Singapore have a better future?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a society that is mainly middle class. Over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  however, the income gap has widened  between\r\n\r\nthe  top  earners and those at the bottom.  It  would  be\r\n\r\nmuch simpler to look for ways to distribute our country's\r\n\r\nwealth  more  equitably, than  it  would  be  to  try  to\r\n\r\ndistribute  one group's intelligence more equitably.   We\r\n\r\nshould put our efforts into nurturing those who are  more\r\n\r\ngifted and intelligent among us, so that they can add  to\r\n\r\nthe  country's progress and wealth, which can  be  shared\r\n\r\nmore equitably with all citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Education Minister said yesterday, and I\r\n\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Those students who will benefit from the greater\r\n\r\neducational  options being introduced,  must  not  forget\r\n\r\nthat  the  opportunities that they enjoy  are  ultimately\r\n\r\njustified  only  by the quality of their  commitment  and\r\n\r\nservice  to our nation and the general social  good.   If\r\n\r\nour  JC  students  leave  the system  very  bright,  very\r\n\r\ncreative  and innovative, having benefited from the  best\r\n\r\nthat  our  system has to offer, but without  a  sense  of\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  country  and  obligation  to  his  fellow\r\n\r\ncitizens,  then  all  these efforts would  have  come  to\r\n\r\nnothing.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nI agree fully with the Minister.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not particularly care if this reform would\r\n\r\nproduce  Nobel  prize  winners at the  end  of  the  day,\r\n\r\nalthough  it  would be good if it did.   The  fundamental\r\n\r\nthing  is  to  give  every  citizen,  every  student,  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to reach a place in which he or she  can  and\r\n\r\nwill  make  the  greatest possible  contribution  to  the\r\n\r\npublic good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to focus on is to continue to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  meritocracy  and to remove  all  barriers  to\r\n\r\nsocial mobility and create a level playing field so  that\r\n\r\nall   citizens   can  truly  partake   of   equality   of\r\n\r\nopportunity.  In\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  respect, Sir, I find the proposed education  reform\r\n\r\nvery  exciting.   It  is  exciting  because  it  embraces\r\n\r\nenlightened  and forward-looking values as  its  starting\r\n\r\npoint.    It   believes  that  each  person  is   unique,\r\n\r\npossessing  diverse  abilities and talents.   It  affirms\r\n\r\nthat  diversity  is valuable and enriches the  community.\r\n\r\nIt  signals that society values individuals who excel  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  fields, be it sports or arts.  It  promotes  a\r\n\r\nmore balanced view of success and self-worth, beyond just\r\n\r\nacademic results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight in particular four\r\n\r\nproposals in the White Paper for discussion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the proposal to set up new Specialised\r\n\r\nSchools  that cater to students with talents in  specific\r\n\r\nfields,  such  as  the  arts,  sports,  mathematics   and\r\n\r\nscience.   This  would contribute towards broadening  the\r\n\r\nrange of career paths and opportunities for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the promotion of arts, through the proposed  arts\r\n\r\nschool, cannot come at a better time, especially for  the\r\n\r\narts scene when Singapore is gearing up to be the art hub\r\n\r\nfor  the  region, and with the building of the Esplanade.\r\n\r\nIf this bold experiment succeeds, it will contribute to a\r\n\r\nhigher quality of life for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pursuit of excellence in any field requires\r\n\r\nsubstantial   effort   and   investment.    Many    young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans I spoke to have felt that, for a long  time,\r\n\r\nthey have not been able to develop the artistic interests\r\n\r\nbecause  of societal pressures to pursue the 5Cs via  the\r\n\r\ntried and tested traditional academic route.  There seems\r\n\r\nto be no room for the creative, the offbeat, the dreamer.\r\n\r\nWith   the  specialised  schools,  they  will  have   the\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  pursue their interests and  passions  in\r\n\r\narts  or  sports without having to opt out of the system.\r\n\r\nThey  can  combine academic study and the  arts  or  with\r\n\r\nsports.   The signal to society is profound:  the  softer\r\n\r\nside  of  life  matters.  It redefines  the  conventional\r\n\r\ndefinition of success in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these specialised schools in arts and sports\r\n\r\nwould not succeed or take root if\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere are not enough jobs waiting for their graduates  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the day.  Hence, I would like to  urge  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  Government agencies, such as MITA and MCDS,  at\r\n\r\nthe same time to actively develop the cultural and sports\r\n\r\nindustries  also.   If  not, then  all  this  effort  and\r\n\r\ninvestment will go down the drain as parents and students\r\n\r\nrealise  very  quickly  that  the  arts  and  sports   in\r\n\r\nSingapore do not offer viable career options.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also cultivate an appreciative audience for\r\n\r\nthe  arts  and  an  interest in the humanities,  such  as\r\n\r\nliterature.  This brings me to the second proposed change\r\n\r\nI want to highlight and that is the proposal to integrate\r\n\r\nan  arts and humanities component into the core education\r\n\r\ncurriculum in regular schools.  This is to be welcomed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, more and more schools have been dropping\r\n\r\nliterature as a subject for their students because it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to score high marks for the subject,  and  the\r\n\r\npoor  scores  were pulling down the school's ranking  and\r\n\r\nthe school's average.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, literature is important not only from the\r\n\r\nperspective  of promoting the arts and to  help  them  to\r\n\r\nspeak  better English, but it is also important  for  the\r\n\r\npersonal  development  of  an individual,  to  help  them\r\n\r\nexpress  themselves better and to see the  world  through\r\n\r\ndifferent  lenses.  Literature has elements  of  history,\r\n\r\ngeography,  philosophy,  sociology  and  psychology.   It\r\n\r\ndeals  with  the  intellectual and emotional  realm.   In\r\n\r\nshort,  life  itself, in all its richness and complexity.\r\n\r\nLiterature is not known as the \"Queen of Humanities\"  for\r\n\r\nnothing.  But given the emphasis on school ranking, I  am\r\n\r\nnot  hopeful  if  this  proposed change  would  see  more\r\n\r\nschools  offering literature or more students  taking  up\r\n\r\nliterature  again.  They will more likely  go  for  other\r\n\r\nsubjects which are easier to score, such as geography.  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge the Education Ministry to relook the  ranking\r\n\r\nsystem, a point I will come to shortly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There also needs to be a comprehensive drive to\r\n\r\naddress  the  serious  shortage of qualified  literature,\r\n\r\narts and sports teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third proposal I found exciting about the White\r\n\r\nPaper  is  the added emphasis on non-academic  curriculum\r\n\r\nwith  more  weight given to co-curricular activities.   I\r\n\r\ncommend  the  move to introduce a holistic  certification\r\n\r\nwhereby  the  CCA  achievements and  academic  grades  of\r\n\r\nstudents  are reflected in a single \"A\" level certificate\r\n\r\nand  the proposal to give CCA additional weights  in  the\r\n\r\nuniversity admission criteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, when we look back on our school days, we do\r\n\r\nnot  think  \"Oh  yes,  I had a great  time  solving  that\r\n\r\nmathematics  problem.\"   No, more  often  than  not,  the\r\n\r\nmemories that stay with us for the rest of our lives  are\r\n\r\ntimes  singing  around the campfire as a  Girl  Guide  or\r\n\r\nstaging  a school play, or running around in the  netball\r\n\r\nfield.  Our memories intuitively give more weight to CCA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should review how we rank schools, now\r\n\r\nmainly based on academic results.  Ranking criteria  also\r\n\r\nhave  to  be broad based, in tandem with the broad  based\r\n\r\neducation  we  want to introduce, and the school  ranking\r\n\r\nshould  give due recognition to schools that do  well  in\r\n\r\nliterature, the arts, sports and CCA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that all schools in Singapore use the School\r\n\r\nExcellence   Model   for   self-appraisal    for    their\r\n\r\nperformance.   The  School  Excellence  Model  recognises\r\n\r\nachievement  and effort beyond academic results,  in  the\r\n\r\narts,   physical  fitness,  sports  and  uniformed  group\r\n\r\nactivities,  and  so  on.  But as I understand  it,  this\r\n\r\nmodel does not contribute to the ranking of schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the green light for a few private schools to be\r\n\r\nset  up,  perhaps  we  should  consider  setting  up   an\r\n\r\nindependent  body in Singapore, equivalent  to  the  UK's\r\n\r\nQuality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.  Its  core\r\n\r\nbusiness is to review the quality and standards  of  UK's\r\n\r\nhigher  education.   Such an agency in  Singapore  should\r\n\r\naudit  the  way  in  which each JC and  secondary  school\r\n\r\nmanages  the  overall  quality  and  standards   of   its\r\n\r\nprovision and review academic standards and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquality  of  teaching and learning in each subject  area,\r\n\r\nand  also  give points to CCA in the ranking of  schools.\r\n\r\nThis  will also help the public to be better equipped  to\r\n\r\nmake  informed  decisions on which school to  select  for\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth proposal I want to highlight is that\r\n\r\nallowing   a   few   privately-run  and  privately-funded\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools or JCs.  This is a good move,  despite\r\n\r\nthe  allegations of elitism, as this will allow those who\r\n\r\ncould  not  fit into the regular system a menu  of  other\r\n\r\nchoices.   But why not go all the way and also  allow  at\r\n\r\nleast  one  private university, privately-run, privately-funded,  to  complete the track and to compete  with  our\r\n\r\nuniversities  for the good students in each  cohort?   Or\r\n\r\nelse  our  good  students produced up to JC  level,  then\r\n\r\nalready  used  to  a more rigorous intellectual  climate,\r\n\r\nwould  have  little option here but to go to  Ivy  League\r\n\r\nuniversities in the US, such as Harvard and Princeton, if\r\n\r\nour  own  universities do not also revamp their  teaching\r\n\r\nmethods or their curriculum.  This would not help  us  to\r\n\r\nachieve our vision of being the Harvard of the East.  The\r\n\r\nAmerican system offers the choice of both a public and  a\r\n\r\nprivate   system.   At  the  university  level,   private\r\n\r\ninstitutions outnumber public institutions by a factor of\r\n\r\nthree to one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to align our universities to\r\n\r\nthe  changes as part of this education reform and, at the\r\n\r\nsame  time, to broaden the choices for our students  with\r\n\r\nat  least  one  privately-funded university.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve   that   this   greater   differentiation    will\r\n\r\nnecessarily lead to a more elitist system where only  the\r\n\r\nrich  and powerful would benefit.  In Harvard in  the  US\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  those who can pay full fees  are  charged\r\n\r\nfull  fees.  The middle class and poor get financial  aid\r\n\r\nof  a  sliding  scale.  All financial aid at  Harvard  is\r\n\r\nbased on need, and almost half of its students get direct\r\n\r\ngrants which come up to just under half the tuition bill.\r\n\r\nOr  take  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   It\r\n\r\nalso offers an array of financial assistance schemes  for\r\n\r\ndeserving  students.  Each admission criterion  is  based\r\n\r\nnot on the ability to pay but on a complex evaluation  of\r\n\r\nthe applicants' aptitude as well as their attitudes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Dean of MIT Admissions, Marilee Jones was\r\n\r\nquoted  as  saying  in one article,  one  way  they  sort\r\n\r\napplicants, other than the academic qualification, is  to\r\n\r\nrate  them  on three specific dimensions of the student's\r\n\r\nlife   -   initiatives   in   co-curricular   activities;\r\n\r\ninitiatives  in  inter-personal  skills;  initiatives  in\r\n\r\nextra-curricular activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicants may vary greatly, but that is what\r\n\r\nthe MIT wants.  As Ms Jones explained, and I quote,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The key word, as you can see, is initiative because\r\n\r\nthis  is the most important characteristic we select for.\r\n\r\nWe  try  to  admit  people who take initiative  in  their\r\n\r\nlives, who take responsibility for their education.  Many\r\n\r\nstudents  study  hard, get good grades and  good  scores.\r\n\r\nBut   many  of  those  do  it  because  it  is  a  family\r\n\r\nexpectation  or community pressure or a myriad  of  other\r\n\r\nreasons.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe  added  that it was passion that they look  for.   We\r\n\r\nhave  a  high tendency to admit students, she  said,  who\r\n\r\npursue   their  activities  at  a  very  high  level   of\r\n\r\ndistinction but these activities can be anything.  \"It is\r\n\r\nthe passion that counts.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the passion that counts indeed. And it\r\n\r\nis  no  wonder  that  you do not hear many  MIT  students\r\n\r\ncomplaining endlessly of stress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the White Paper offers an exciting\r\n\r\nvision  of  the  future.  There are so many opportunities\r\n\r\nfor the students to maximise their potential.  That said,\r\n\r\nhowever, the dazzling array of choices can also be  quite\r\n\r\nconfusing.   How  are the students going  to  know  which\r\n\r\nsubject to take and which combinations of those subjects,\r\n\r\nwhich  route to take and which school to opt for to  give\r\n\r\nthe  courses and the route that they choose, whether they\r\n\r\ncan  afford  to  go  to a particular school,  private  or\r\n\r\npublic and, if not, what financial aid is available,  and\r\n\r\nso   on?     Students  from  low  income   families,   in\r\n\r\nparticular,   will  be  disadvantaged   as   their   home\r\n\r\nenvironments  may  not  provide  them  the  support   and\r\n\r\nguidance that they need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot presume that somewhere along the way,\r\n\r\na  teacher, administrator, or coach will take  a  special\r\n\r\ninterest in each student or help the\r\n\r\nyoung person\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  recognise  his  or her strengths and  abilities,  and\r\n\r\nencourage that student to plan for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to place more emphasis on\r\n\r\nproviding   schools  with  good  qualified   counsellors.\r\n\r\nWithout adequate counselling, students have no choice but\r\n\r\nto  revert to self-selection and, too often, that is  the\r\n\r\nbase  where their friends are.  Low-income families  must\r\n\r\nbe  assisted  if  you are to substantially  increase  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  students  of different  races,  cultures  and\r\n\r\nbackgrounds in higher education.  We have been working on\r\n\r\nclass-size   reduction,  higher  standards  and   greater\r\n\r\naccountability.  We have begun to address the  importance\r\n\r\nof    preparing   more   and   better-qualified    school\r\n\r\nadministrators.  To complete the job, we need to be  sure\r\n\r\nwe have enough qualified counsellors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers already complain of being overloaded with\r\n\r\nwork.   With  enough  counsellors on hand,  teachers  and\r\n\r\nadministrators   can  better  focus  on   their   primary\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  The provision of high quality, readily\r\n\r\naccessible counselling must be at the heart of a  culture\r\n\r\nthat  is committed to enabling each individual to realise\r\n\r\nhis or her full potential.  With adequate counselling, we\r\n\r\nwill reap the full benefits of this education reform.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise in support of the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while in Delhi last week attending the Asian\r\n\r\nNetwork  of  Major Cities Meeting, I met the Governor  of\r\n\r\nTokyo,  Mr  Shintaro Ishihara, who is also  a  well-known\r\n\r\nwriter  and  a  critical thinker.   He  was  awarded  the\r\n\r\nprestigious  Akutagawa  Prize for  the  novel  \"Taiyo  no\r\n\r\nKisetsu\"  (or  \"The Season of the Sun\").  He  was  indeed\r\n\r\nfull  of praise for our education system.  He cited  what\r\n\r\nhe  saw  in  how  music was taught in our schools  as  an\r\n\r\nexample  of what he would like done in Tokyo.  Similarly,\r\n\r\nhe thought that it was strange that Singapore was already\r\n\r\nusing  the  ERP technology, he said from Japan,  but  yet\r\n\r\nthat system was not even introduced in his own country.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the beauty of our system. It is a subject\r\n\r\nof  praise  in  many countries, both in third  and  first\r\n\r\nworlds, but that did not stop us from improving and  fine-tuning it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed the purpose of this exercise. The\r\n\r\nproposals put forth by the Junior College/Upper Secondary\r\n\r\nEducation Review Committee, in the words of Minister RAdm\r\n\r\nTeo Chee Hean, will assure future cohorts of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nof  a  relevant  and  forward-looking education  that  is\r\n\r\nalways in time for the future.  I strongly agree.  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State Tharman Shanmugaratnam and  his  able\r\n\r\nCommittee  deserve  our  encouragement  and  support  for\r\n\r\nbravely  venturing into those proposed changes,  although\r\n\r\nthere are those who feel that they could still be bolder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, the future challenges awaiting are\r\n\r\ninnovation-driven and more globalised.  Present standards\r\n\r\nof  secondary and JC education will not be  adequate.   I\r\n\r\nshare  the  confidence  that the  changes  proposed  will\r\n\r\nnurture  the skills, spirit and values required  for  the\r\n\r\nmore  competitive  world.  In fact, the  inherent  spirit\r\n\r\nshown  by  MOE, indeed Singaporeans as a whole,  to  make\r\n\r\nrefinements to an already successful system of education,\r\n\r\nwill bode well for our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the broader the education system, the more\r\n\r\nflexible  our students will be and thus the  easier  they\r\n\r\nadapt  to changing needs.  We must move away from strait-jacketed  systems  that  will hamper  our  movements.   I\r\n\r\nrealise  that many of us, especially parents,  are  often\r\n\r\nhamstrung   with  outdated  ideas  about  education   and\r\n\r\ncareers.  Parents often think of their children in  terms\r\n\r\nof  being a doctor, lawyer or engineer.  But the  profile\r\n\r\nof the economy has changed so much that we have to change\r\n\r\nour mindsets and look at alternative routes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the North East CDC, for example, we have chosen\r\n\r\nCreativity and Entrepreneurship as one of the  key  areas\r\n\r\nof our activities.  The idea being, not just\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  create  more  entrepreneurs but  more  important,  to\r\n\r\ninstill a sense of enterprise in the hearts and minds  of\r\n\r\nour citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was in secondary school, the mindset was\r\n\r\nto  go  for  medicine.  When I failed to get a place  for\r\n\r\nMedicine  in  the  Pre-University class,  I  remember  my\r\n\r\n`mentor   friend', a retired British Major,  telling  me,\r\n\r\nnot to worry, I could be a good nurse.  Little did I know\r\n\r\nthat  I  would end up `nursing' the community.  Community\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and upliftment became my passion  for  life.\r\n\r\nThis  helped after I switched from the science stream  to\r\n\r\ndoing arts or humanities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also glad, Sir, that during my secondary\r\n\r\neducation,  the Principal of RI then, the  late  Mr  E.W.\r\n\r\nJesudason,  introduced Current Affairs, as an  examinable\r\n\r\nsubject.  I remember counting the number of coconut trees\r\n\r\nin  the school compound and the question came out in  the\r\n\r\ntest  paper.   And I scored. Sir, not to  be  accused  of\r\n\r\nfailing  to  see  the  wood for the trees,  my  point  in\r\n\r\nmentioning  this anecdote is to emphasise that  education\r\n\r\nis  more  than  just a matter of passing the conventional\r\n\r\nsubjects taught in class.  Current affairs taught me  the\r\n\r\nimportance of knowing what is going on around us, and  it\r\n\r\ngave  me a good foundation for my journalistic career  of\r\n\r\nmore than 20 prime years of my life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that now \"diversity and flexibility\" is\r\n\r\nthe  \"way  forward\".   A  broader and  more  flexible  JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  with a focus on skills, more  than  content,\r\n\r\ngiving  students breadth and more flexible options,  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  open  new horizons for what  education  means.\r\n\r\nThis  has  implications not only  for  JC  and  secondary\r\n\r\neducation  but  also at the lower levels of  primary  and\r\n\r\neven pre-primary education.  Parents not only need to  be\r\n\r\nalerted  but  they must also be garnered to  support  the\r\n\r\nproposed  changes.  While communications skills  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  due  and greater attention to the JC  students,  I\r\n\r\nhope  and  trust  MOE will also polish its communications\r\n\r\nskills with parents to win over their support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of competition in the system needs\r\n\r\naddressing.  As criticisms\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseem  rife  as  to  the  fact that the  new  system  only\r\n\r\nencourages  further elitism and an even greater  struggle\r\n\r\nto  get into the band of 'elite' students who will get to\r\n\r\nbenefit from the more 'flexible' options in the system, I\r\n\r\nthink  we,  as  a  nation, must be prepared  to  realise,\r\n\r\nwelcome and cherish competition rather than shy away from\r\n\r\nit.   Yet, it does not mean that students who do not  fit\r\n\r\ninto the top bandwidths will be forgotten.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexibility should be tailored to ensure that\r\n\r\nstudents  who  do  not excel in the normative  system  of\r\n\r\neducation,  be  given  a  chance to  excel  in  different\r\n\r\nfields.   This  is  something which  Singapore  has  been\r\n\r\nconsciously striving for through the Polytechnic and  ITE\r\n\r\neducation systems.  I was among those who visited the MOE-arranged  ITE  visits and I am very  impressed  with  the\r\n\r\nattention given and progress made in those areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But further flexibility is required. We should be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  recognise talent from within these  systems\r\n\r\nwhich   are   seen  as  secondary  in  stature   to   the\r\n\r\ncontemporary secondary education-JC route, and  hence  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  offer  them and welcome them  into  further\r\n\r\neducation  in  their  later life.   In  this  respect,  I\r\n\r\nsupport the proposal to continue with the three-year Pre-University   Centralised  Institutes   system   and,   if\r\n\r\nnecessary, open another to provide more opportunities for\r\n\r\nthose on the borderlines who might have the potential  as\r\n\r\nlate-bloomers.  The proposal to allow some JC students to\r\n\r\ndo their course in three years is also worthy of support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system must be prepared to recognise\r\n\r\nthat the future of national educational systems must take\r\n\r\nas  their top priority the infusion into young minds  the\r\n\r\nhunger  for  knowledge,  the ability  to  learn  and  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  expression.  This hunger for  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nability  to learn should be given a longer leash,  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  by  allowing students to choose at an  early  age\r\n\r\nareas of interest and to encourage their development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pointless to encourage creativity in general\r\n\r\nwhile keeping the options of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudent encased within what are deemed as 'guidelines for\r\n\r\nsuccess'.  It would be an even greater mistake to try  to\r\n\r\nteach  a  person  to be creative and expressive.   It  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  has to be realised, or  released  .  not\r\n\r\ntaught.   One sure way to encourage it is to ensure  that\r\n\r\nstudents  know that wherever their passions may be,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  supported and given an avenue of expression  by\r\n\r\nthe education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, however sound the principles\r\n\r\nproposed,  the  teachers must be prepared to  play  their\r\n\r\npart.  Teachers come with their own mindsets too.  A good\r\n\r\nremake  programme  is necessary to help prepare  teachers\r\n\r\nfor their new role.  This needs time and closer scrutiny.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other area which would help the proposed changes\r\n\r\nto  take  root faster is to infuse more foreign  students\r\n\r\nespecially  from  countries which have a  more  open  and\r\n\r\nliberal  structure.  Scholarships could  be  offered  for\r\n\r\nsome  of such students to encourage our students to  also\r\n\r\nopen up and benefit from the new system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a final note, Sir, these proposed changes clearly\r\n\r\nsend a strong signal on the needs for change.  Similarly,\r\n\r\nI   hope   those   running  `alternative'  systems,   the\r\n\r\nmadrasahs,  for example, will take note and heed  of  the\r\n\r\nchanges also needed there.  I hope that the MOE will also\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  provide help to ensure that  the  secondary\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  also  measure up to the changing  demands  for\r\n\r\nsecondary education for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nfirst  say  what a pleasure it is to be able to  rise  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of a motion on education in this House.   I  say\r\n\r\nthis  with a lot of feeling because, in this House,  over\r\n\r\nthe  last  five  or six years, I have witnessed  numerous\r\n\r\ndebates on education policy, some of which had been quite\r\n\r\npungent,  all motivated by very fundamental concerns  for\r\n\r\nour educational system and our children.  But this is the\r\n\r\nfirst time I find\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmyself  heartened by what I see as a broad-based systemic\r\n\r\nresponse  from the Ministry of Education to  a  long-term\r\n\r\nchallenge that we face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was therefore with some concern that I listened\r\n\r\nto  some of the speeches we heard yesterday, where a  lot\r\n\r\nof focus and attention were drawn to various concerns and\r\n\r\naspects of these recommendations which are likely  to  be\r\n\r\nproblematic.  I fully agree that there is a  whole  range\r\n\r\nof  concerns to be addressed, and one could argue that no\r\n\r\ndebate  on  education  would  be  complete  without  such\r\n\r\nconcerns.  But the key point really is that we should not\r\n\r\nlose  sight  of  the bigger picture, as Dr  Wang  put  it\r\n\r\nyesterday, not lose sight of the wood for the trees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Sir, this Report and the changes it\r\n\r\nrecommends represent a watershed in our education system.\r\n\r\nWhy?   Because, over the years, the education system  has\r\n\r\nhad  a  host of criticisms levelled at it, and I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  here,  after several  decades,  a  robust\r\n\r\nsystemic  response to such criticisms.  What  were  these\r\n\r\ncriticisms which still continue to occupy a big  part  of\r\n\r\nour  discussion?   We  say  that  our  students  are  too\r\n\r\nnarrowly  or  academically focused.   We  say  they  lack\r\n\r\ncreativity  and thinking skills.  We say  the  system  is\r\n\r\nrigid, it does not have enough flexibility or give enough\r\n\r\nchoice,  and  that it does not cater to  those  who  have\r\n\r\nspecific  strengths,  whether  it  is  in  one   or   two\r\n\r\nparticular academic subjects or to those who may excel in\r\n\r\nsports or the arts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, many of the Ministry of Education's\r\n\r\ninitiatives,  I  felt,  addressed  these  criticisms   in\r\n\r\nincremental    steps.    But   the   Report    and    its\r\n\r\nrecommendations  represent  a  systemic  review  and   an\r\n\r\noverhaul  of the upper secondary and JC education  system\r\n\r\nthat substantially address these points.  In terms of the\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  as the Report says, it is broader  and  more\r\n\r\nflexible.   We talk about breadth through this  Knowledge\r\n\r\nand  Inquiry  component or Project Work.  We  talk  about\r\n\r\nvariation or diversity in the education landscape through\r\n\r\nspecialised independent schools\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  integrated programmes.  I believe these  will  go  a\r\n\r\nlong  way in addressing many of the concerns that we have\r\n\r\nhad and will continue to have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I believe these changes are profound\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  principles that  are  embedded  in  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations,   specifically,   the   principles    of\r\n\r\nflexibility  and  diversity.  I believe  they  provide  a\r\n\r\nfoundation  upon  which  we  can  build  an  even  better\r\n\r\neducation  system  for  - as the Minister  put  it  -  an\r\n\r\ninnovation-driven future which, by implication, is  going\r\n\r\nto  be less deterministic.  But these principles are  two\r\n\r\nsides of the same coin.  Many of us have argued, in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  outside, for flexibility and diversity.   But\r\n\r\nwhen  these  are  in  the offing now,  we  need  to  also\r\n\r\nsquarely face up to the challenge they pose to all of  us\r\n\r\nwho are part of the Singapore system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I mean by that? I believe that when we have\r\n\r\ngreater   flexibility  and  diversity  in  the  education\r\n\r\nsystem, we are now seeing that the equilibrium, in  terms\r\n\r\nof  the  responsibility  for  education,  shifts  towards\r\n\r\nparents  and  students, and away  from  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation and the school system.  And I think that  is  a\r\n\r\nshift that is in the right direction.  What it means  is,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  when  we have greater flexibility  in  our\r\n\r\nsystem,  it allows an individual to explore his interests\r\n\r\nand  discover his strengths.  But what it also  means  is\r\n\r\nthat that individual has the onus upon himself or herself\r\n\r\nto  make  the  most of what is presented to him  or  her.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no one-track cookie-cutter approach  which  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to deliver a definitive outcome.  It is now a  lot\r\n\r\nmore variable and we have to take responsibility for it - the parents and the students together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same could be argued for the point about\r\n\r\ndiversity.   The Report outlines numerous initiatives  on\r\n\r\nhow the educational landscape in Singapore will or can be\r\n\r\ndifferent.  If you contemplate it, it is, as the previous\r\n\r\nspeaker,  the  hon.  Member Ms Irene  Ng  put  it,  quite\r\n\r\nexciting.  We would have a range of schools, all of  good\r\n\r\nquality,  some  within  the public  system  who  will  be\r\n\r\noutstanding  in certain areas, whether it is in  Science,\r\n\r\nMathematics or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nothers;  there  will  be  private  schools  with  foreign\r\n\r\nstudents making up to 50%; and there will be schools that\r\n\r\noffer  integrated  programmes  and  a  variety  of  other\r\n\r\nchoices.   In  a sense, the mind boggles at the  kind  of\r\n\r\noptions that will be presented to parents and students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the flip side of such diversity or\r\n\r\ndifferentiation in the system is that there is  the  risk\r\n\r\nof  elitism.  And we cannot run away from that.  What  we\r\n\r\nhave  to ask ourselves is: on balance, is it a good or  a\r\n\r\nbad  thing?   Does  it  enhance our system  as  a  whole,\r\n\r\nproviding benefits to all?  I believe the answer would be\r\n\r\nan  unequivocal yes, especially if the Government - which\r\n\r\nI  believe the Minister has already given some  level  of\r\n\r\nundertaking - will address some of the issues  pertaining\r\n\r\nto  the  negative  aspects that  might  arise  from  such\r\n\r\ndifferentiation, eg, enhancing access to  these  schemes,\r\n\r\nso  that one's socio-economic background is not a factor,\r\n\r\nbut  rather  meritocracy.  I think that is a  fundamental\r\n\r\nprinciple that needs to be upheld throughout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the benefits that accrue from such\r\n\r\nflexibility  - and the Report here focuses  primarily  at\r\n\r\nthe  top  tier  -  must percolate to all  levels  of  the\r\n\r\neducation  system.   These are the  ways  we  can  ensure\r\n\r\ngreater  equity and broader benefit from what I  consider\r\n\r\nto be such path-breaking moves in the education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think this Report and its\r\n\r\nrecommendations are a panacea, and this should be obvious\r\n\r\nfrom  the debate so far.  There still remain many  issues\r\n\r\nin  people's minds.  And it is by no means the end of the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  education.   But  I  think  it  sets  a  firm\r\n\r\nfoundation  upon  which we can build the  future  of  our\r\n\r\neducation system to meet the challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to consider doing\r\n\r\ntwo  things.  One is to do more; the other is to do less.\r\n\r\nLet me take the do-less first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as with any change in the curriculum, we are\r\n\r\nfaced  with  the tension between breadth  and  depth.   I\r\n\r\nreadily\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcede this is not an easy trade-off.  After all, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  have students skimming the surface  for  a\r\n\r\nwhole  range  of subjects without really  having  a  deep\r\n\r\nappreciation  of  any one of them.  Neither  do  we  want\r\n\r\nboffins  who  drill so deep in one particular  area  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  lost  to  the world when  it  comes  to  other\r\n\r\naspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I look at the Report, I felt that, yet\r\n\r\nagain  perhaps, we seem to want to have our cake and  eat\r\n\r\nit.   With the new system at the JC level, students  will\r\n\r\ntake  at  least  seven subjects - Project  Work,  General\r\n\r\nPaper,  Knowledge and Inquiry, Mother Tongue -  at  least\r\n\r\nthree  core  subjects  and a contrasting  subject.   That\r\n\r\ncompares with the minimum of three \"A\"s and two  \"O\"s  in\r\n\r\nthe  current system or, if you are a student doing a full\r\n\r\nload, then it is four \"A\"s and two \"O\"s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of curriculum time, we are told that for\r\n\r\nthe  Science students, there may be a 10% reduction  and,\r\n\r\nfor Arts students, there may be no reduction.  My concern\r\n\r\nis  this: curriculum time represents the front end of any\r\n\r\neducation process in the schools.  It is a measure of the\r\n\r\ndirect contact time that the student has in his classroom\r\n\r\nor  in  the  lecture theatre in the junior college.   But\r\n\r\nthere  is a lot that happens outside curriculum time  and\r\n\r\nthat  indeed  ought  to  happen outside  curriculum  time\r\n\r\nwhich,   in   a  sense,  we  cannot  capture  with   this\r\n\r\narithmetic.  There is a multiplier that we will  need  to\r\n\r\nfactor  in, whether it is in self-study, research or  any\r\n\r\nother   endeavour   that  is  related,  peripherally   or\r\n\r\notherwise to the subject at hand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I would like to urge the Minister to do less,\r\n\r\nie,   having  taken  the  bold  step  of  creating  these\r\n\r\ndifferentiated pathways in the secondary, upper secondary\r\n\r\nand junior college system, and acknowledging the need for\r\n\r\ndiversity,  why not go a step further and ensure  a  more\r\n\r\nsubstantial  reduction in the curriculum  time,  say,  by\r\n\r\n20%?   I am not saying this because it is going to  be  a\r\n\r\nsolution  to the question of stress.  I think stress  has\r\n\r\nmany  sources.  The time spent on curriculum is but  one,\r\n\r\nand   I  do  not  think  any  amount  of  reduction  will\r\n\r\nnecessarily solve that.  But I am saying\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  because, first, the same curriculum time under this\r\n\r\nequation  does actually mean a heavier workload  for  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  So, we would be disingenuous if we say that as\r\n\r\na  result  of  these changes the students have  the  same\r\n\r\nworkload.  The answer is that it is not.  The reality  is\r\n\r\nthat  they will have a higher workload.  So, let us  face\r\n\r\nup to it and let us all be prepared for that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I do believe that a certain amount of\r\n\r\ndowntime,   especially  from  such  diverse   educational\r\n\r\nopportunities,  is  necessary to  allow  the  student  to\r\n\r\nreflect,  to  synthesise - whether it is through  project\r\n\r\nwork  or  other  activities  -  in  order  to  allow  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  educational disciplines  that  he  or  she  is\r\n\r\nexposed to, to have an impact on him or her.   After all,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  have  to let the land lie fallow  for  a  while\r\n\r\nbefore  we seed it for the next cycle.  In the same  way,\r\n\r\nit  may be useful to give our students a little bit  more\r\n\r\ntime  to pursue something in greater depth or to look  at\r\n\r\nthe  inter-linkages or through other  measures,  and  not\r\n\r\nlook  at  it  as a container or a vat that  needs  to  be\r\n\r\nconstantly  topped up for fear that any vacancy  will  be\r\n\r\nmisused or mis-spent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, on doing more, Sir, I am convinced\r\n\r\nof   the  benefits  that  a  system  embedded  with   the\r\n\r\nprinciples of flexibility and diversity will bring to our\r\n\r\nstudents  as  well as our general system.  My  lament  is\r\n\r\nthat the proposals here are confined primarily to the top\r\n\r\nquartile  of  our  cohorts.   It  can  be  argued   that,\r\n\r\nactually, the top quartile are the most resilient of  any\r\n\r\ncohort,  and  perhaps  the  most  flexible  in  a  cohort\r\n\r\nbecause,  presumably, they have the turn of  mind  to  be\r\n\r\nable  to  adapt  themselves to different challenges  more\r\n\r\nreadily than the next quartile or two in a cohort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the case, I would like to ask and urge\r\n\r\nthe Minister to see how quickly at least core elements of\r\n\r\nthe  proposal that have been laid out before  us  can  be\r\n\r\nextended to the broader education system in Singapore, so\r\n\r\nthat all students and, in particular, those who might  be\r\n\r\nweaker\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  the  opportunity  to  benefit  from  such  multiple\r\n\r\npathways - pathways that will enable them perhaps to find\r\n\r\ntheir strengths much earlier and capitalise on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have a system where after 10 years they go\r\n\r\nto  ITE or, beyond that, to polytechnic, JC or university\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  But in the secondary school itself,  giving\r\n\r\nthem those opportunities to discover their strengths  and\r\n\r\nto  capitalise on them earlier is critical.  I  think  we\r\n\r\nhave the seeds of such a possible system in what has been\r\n\r\nrecommended today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect I would urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider - and this is a point that Dr Jennifer Lee  made\r\n\r\nyesterday  and which I want to echo - is that  whilst  we\r\n\r\nfocus  at the upper secondary and junior college  levels,\r\n\r\nit  would be a natural progression - some might argue, as\r\n\r\nDr  Lee did, it might be an inverse progression - for  us\r\n\r\nto  consider what can be done at the primary level, maybe\r\n\r\neven pre-primary.  I know the Ministry is already doing a\r\n\r\nreview   for  pre-primary  education,  but  for   primary\r\n\r\neducation  we  have used our core subjects - Mathematics,\r\n\r\nMother  Tongue and English - and, I think, Science  after\r\n\r\nPrimary 4.  The question is: is there scope to do more to\r\n\r\ncreate greater latitude within the primary school system?\r\n\r\nThat, I know, is an open-ended challenge.  I do not  have\r\n\r\na specific proposal for the Minister but I do ask that he\r\n\r\nand  his  team commit to finding a broader-based  primary\r\n\r\nschool education system for Singaporeans as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to participate in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report on the JC/Upper Secondary Education\r\n\r\nReview Committee contains two broad proposals - a broader\r\n\r\nand  more  flexible JC curriculum and, secondly,  a  more\r\n\r\ndiverse educational landscape.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support these proposals which I feel are\r\n\r\nlong  overdue.  In fact, the proposals are comprehensive,\r\n\r\nconsidered and, most importantly, take into account a lot\r\n\r\nof feedback which we have obtained from parents, students\r\n\r\nand   employers.    It  is  a  common   complaint   among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that they give a lot of feedback but nothing\r\n\r\nhappens.   But  I think this is one example where  people\r\n\r\nhave  given feedback and it actually finds its way  in  a\r\n\r\nconcrete  form  in  this report  which  I  hope  will  be\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three proposals in the report in which I\r\n\r\nhave  particular  interest. First, the recommendation  to\r\n\r\nfocus   on   skills  more  than  content.   Second,   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to  give  students  more  flexibility  on\r\n\r\nsubjects.  Third, the recommendation to place emphasis on\r\n\r\nthe  non-academic  curriculum  to  develop  strength   of\r\n\r\ncharacter, leadership and team skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On skills rather than content, we do acknowledge\r\n\r\nthat  the weakness of our education system thus  far  has\r\n\r\nbeen  over-emphasis on content.  Sometimes, I cannot help\r\n\r\ncomparing  our  educational system to the  production  of\r\n\r\nfoie  gras.   Foie  gras, as you know, is  a  gastronomic\r\n\r\ndelicacy.  It is duck or goose liver, very high  quality,\r\n\r\nvery   expensive,  top  of  the  range,  very   painfully\r\n\r\nproduced.   It  is the fatty liver which is  produced  by\r\n\r\nover-feeding  ducks and geese.  Just let me describe  the\r\n\r\nprocess  which may sound vaguely familiar.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the desired taste and texture, ducks  and  geese\r\n\r\nare force-fed two or three times a day with up to half  a\r\n\r\nkilogram of grain and fat.  After two or three weeks, the\r\n\r\nbirds are ready for slaughter and their livers would have\r\n\r\nswelled  to about between six and ten times their natural\r\n\r\nsize.  Apart from being fed for more than they would  eat\r\n\r\nnaturally,  the  diet of foie gras birds is  deliberately\r\n\r\ndeficient  in  basic nutrients and this makes  the  liver\r\n\r\naccumulate  so much fat that they can no longer  function\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that our entire education system is\r\n\r\nquite  as  bad  as that, but we must admit  that  our  JC\r\n\r\nstudents\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave been stuffed with quite a lot of content and many of\r\n\r\nthem have been stuffed with Science at the expense of the\r\n\r\nhumanities, which leads to a certain imbalance.   I  will\r\n\r\nspeak a bit more about that later.  The point I am making\r\n\r\nis that the over-emphasis on content means that they have\r\n\r\nnot been able to think out of the box. They have not been\r\n\r\ntrained  as  much as they ought to have been in  critical\r\n\r\nand   independent   thinking.   I   fully   support   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations from this Committee because I think  they\r\n\r\nare  aimed at promoting and developing critical  thinking\r\n\r\nwhich is going to be extremely important in an innovation-driven global society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I know of one university lecturer, a\r\n\r\nCaucasian, whose daughter was in a local school.  But  he\r\n\r\ntransferred her out of the local school after a while  to\r\n\r\nan  international school because apparently, the teachers\r\n\r\nat  the local school complained that she kept asking  too\r\n\r\nmany  questions.  She always wanted to know  \"why\".   She\r\n\r\njust could not memorise the answers but asked, \"Why this?\r\n\r\nWhy  that?\"  But given the new global circumstances  that\r\n\r\nwe  find  ourselves  faced with, \"why\"  is  an  important\r\n\r\nquestion, \"how\" is an important question.  Can  I  do  it\r\n\r\nbetter?  What are the reasons? Can I get round this?  All\r\n\r\nthese  are  questions  that  we  need  to  encourage  our\r\n\r\nstudents to think and to develop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that the function of education is\r\n\r\nnot  just  to prepare people for jobs.  It is to  prepare\r\n\r\npeople  for  life.   And  that  brings  me  to  the  next\r\n\r\nrecommendation which is having more flexible options  for\r\n\r\nour  students. Currently, about 40% of JC students  offer\r\n\r\nonly  Mathematics and Science subjects with no humanities\r\n\r\noffered beyond their \"O\" levels.  One of the reasons  for\r\n\r\nthis,  as  my colleague in this House, Ms Irene  Ng,  has\r\n\r\npointed out, is that it is easier to score in Mathematics\r\n\r\nand  Science subjects which are either formulae in nature\r\n\r\nor  heavily memory-based, at least at JC level.   Another\r\n\r\nreason   is  that  in  the  past,  these  subjects   were\r\n\r\nemphasised to equip the students for specific jobs.   But\r\n\r\nthe job landscape has now changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Singapore and our society as a whole have\r\n\r\nsuffered to some degree from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  over-emphasis on the Sciences at the expense  of  the\r\n\r\nArts   and  it  is  high  time  that  we  corrected  this\r\n\r\nimbalance.  Science  and Mathematics  teach  you  how  to\r\n\r\nconstruct  a gun.  It is humanities, philosophy  and  the\r\n\r\nlaw  that tell you when to pull the trigger.  Having  one\r\n\r\nwithout the other is like \"yin\" without the \"yang\" -  you\r\n\r\nhave  a serious imbalance.  This lack of emphasis on  the\r\n\r\nhumanities  would, to some extent, explain  the  lack  of\r\n\r\ncreative  thinking,  the weakness  in  our  communication\r\n\r\nskills.   And I dare say if we improve on the humanities,\r\n\r\nMCDS  may be a happier Ministry because it might actually\r\n\r\nimprove  the  marriage  rate of  highly  educated  single\r\n\r\nwomen.  I do not promise this but I am saying that it may\r\n\r\nhave an impact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also improve on Singaporeans' social\r\n\r\nskills.  Yesterday, in his speech, Assoc. Prof. Koo  Tsai\r\n\r\nKee  mentioned the fact that we were first in Mathematics\r\n\r\nand  second  in Science.  That is true.  But we  are  the\r\n\r\nonly  society in the world, when you are driving and  you\r\n\r\nsignal  because you want to change lanes, the car  behind\r\n\r\nyou  in the other lane speeds up, it does not let you  go\r\n\r\ninto  the lane.  When you are in Europe, when you signal,\r\n\r\nthey slow down and they let you go into the lane.  But in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  this  is  what  we  do.   We  are  first   in\r\n\r\nMathematics  and second in Science, but we will  not  let\r\n\r\nsomebody get into the lane ahead of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you tried going into the lift, not just HDB\r\n\r\nblocks,  but  any  office blocks?  Somebody  is  actually\r\n\r\nthere  in  the  lift,  but when he sees  you  coming,  he\r\n\r\nquickly  presses  the \"close door\" button.   This  is  an\r\n\r\neducated  society.   Our  town councils  are  in  despair\r\n\r\nbecause  we  always have a problem of  urinating  in  the\r\n\r\nlift.   Then we have things like the \"Hello Kitty\" queues\r\n\r\nwhere  Singaporeans jostle one another to be able to  get\r\n\r\nthe free gift.  The point I am simply making is this.  We\r\n\r\nmay  be  very good in the Sciences, we may be  very  good\r\n\r\ntechnically, but we still have a certain way to go in the\r\n\r\nsocial  graces which I think the humanities will help  in\r\n\r\nsome  measure to enable us to bridge that gap. We  are  a\r\n\r\ndeveloping society, granted,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  our  education system has a lot to do  with  how  we\r\n\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the next recommendation on the\r\n\r\nemphasis  on  the non-academic curriculum to develop  the\r\n\r\nstrength  of character, leadership, and team  skills.   I\r\n\r\nthink  that is extremely important.  We will be excellent\r\n\r\ntechnocrats   but  without  leadership  skills,   without\r\n\r\nvalues, without principles, we are really not anything at\r\n\r\nall.  There  is one international law firm when  I  asked\r\n\r\nthem  what  was  the criterion that they used  for  their\r\n\r\nrecruitment, they said that one of the things  that  they\r\n\r\nlooked at was to see whether a potential candidate  plays\r\n\r\nteam  sports.  They actually prefer people who  excel  at\r\n\r\nteam  sports  rather than those who excel  in  individual\r\n\r\nsports  simply because it means that the person is better\r\n\r\nable  to work in a team and that is more valuable to them\r\n\r\nas an organisation than someone who is a prima donna.   I\r\n\r\nfully support this recommendation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will comment briefly now on the workload and\r\n\r\nstress.  I notice that one of the recommendations in  the\r\n\r\nreport  was  to trim the curriculum and I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry will take due note of that.  In comparison  with\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom and United States, for example, where\r\n\r\nthe  average curriculum time for \"A\" level-type  subjects\r\n\r\nover  two years is 280 hours for the United Kingdom,  240\r\n\r\nhours  for  the  United  States,  it  is  330  hours   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  have commented a lot  on  stress  in  the\r\n\r\nsystem  and MOE's usual response is that this is  due  to\r\n\r\nsociety's distorted definition of success.  That is  only\r\n\r\npart  of the story.  I would ask MOE not to keep trotting\r\n\r\nthis out as the usual answer because it does make parents\r\n\r\ngrit their teeth with frustration.  The truth is that  it\r\n\r\nlies  in  between.  Stress is a combination  of  societal\r\n\r\nexpectation and that is attributable to society.  But  it\r\n\r\nis also partly due to the system and that is attributable\r\n\r\nto MOE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents want their children to succeed. That is a\r\n\r\ngiven.   They would measure that success by the benchmark\r\n\r\nthat  the system sets as indicia of success.  So  ranking\r\n\r\nmatters, results matter, grades matter.  If\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  want to reduce the stress and if we do not want to do\r\n\r\naway with the ranking system, then what I would do is  to\r\n\r\nask  MOE  to  look at the other indicia  of  success,  to\r\n\r\nsignal to society that just because you do not make it to\r\n\r\nJC  or  university, it does not mean that you are  not  a\r\n\r\nsuccess.   That is why I fully support the recommendation\r\n\r\nfor specialised schools for arts and sports, for example.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would ask MOE to consider some form of signalling\r\n\r\nto  parents that just because their children are  in  EM3\r\n\r\nand  land up in Normal (Technical) and ITE, that  ITE  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  end.  Find some form of signalling  to  parents\r\n\r\nthat  ITE  is  actually a beginning. Find  some  form  of\r\n\r\ngiving  indicia  to society whereby they  can  understand\r\n\r\nthat  their  children are in this stream rather  than  in\r\n\r\nthat stream, their children are not failures.  It has  to\r\n\r\ndo with both the system as well as society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, one area of concern I have,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the  same  concern expressed  by  some  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in  this  House, is implementation.   Who  is\r\n\r\ngoing to design the curriculum?  If it is the same people\r\n\r\nwith the same ideas, you may have the same old things but\r\n\r\njust in a new packaging.  I sincerely hope that when  the\r\n\r\nnew  curriculum  is  designed, it will  be  what  it  was\r\n\r\nintended  to  be,  which is fresh,  new,  innovative  and\r\n\r\nexciting.   And the teachers too matter because  teachers\r\n\r\nobviously cannot change their mindsets overnight.  If  it\r\n\r\nis  the  same  teachers,  they  have  got  to  either  be\r\n\r\nretrained or think of a different way in which to  teach.\r\n\r\nSir, I hope that the MOE will look at that as well.  I am\r\n\r\nsure that MOE has already thought of these.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These recommendations are for JCs alone, but\r\n\r\nobviously,  you cannot expect a student, who  has  always\r\n\r\nbeen thinking in the box, through nursery, primary, lower\r\n\r\nsecondary, to suddenly to be able to think out of the box\r\n\r\nonce he hits JC.  If you have ever gone to the wet market\r\n\r\nand  bought  persimmons, they put these  persimmons  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  fully ripe into these boxes  with  carton\r\n\r\ngrates and the cardboard grates are square. So after  the\r\n\r\npersimmons ripen, they all come out square which  is  not\r\n\r\ntheir actual shape.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  we  have  all these little \"square persimmons\"  going\r\n\r\nthrough nursery, primary and lower secondary school,  you\r\n\r\ncannot expect them to suddenly become round in JC.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that  MOE will be looking at this but I would  urge\r\n\r\nthem to reconsider the whole system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to how we measure our success. In\r\n\r\ntoday's  Straits Times, Tan Tarn How in his column  \"From\r\n\r\nthe  Gallery\" commented on the \"mind-numbing  surfeit  of\r\n\r\nmiddle  management minutia\" and he said that the question\r\n\r\nthat  cries out to be asked is this:  how does  one  know\r\n\r\nwhen  one  has succeeded?  How should this recommendation\r\n\r\nbe  measured in terms of success?  I agree,  as  he  said\r\n\r\nthat  you  cannot measure it by the usual  pure  academic\r\n\r\nyardstick  of  whether  we are first  in  Mathematics  or\r\n\r\nSciences. He suggested that one way was using the measure\r\n\r\nthat  we lag behind in, the number of Nobel prize winners\r\n\r\nyou  can  produce  and  the world famous  academics,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  patents filed.  I disagree  with  that.   The\r\n\r\nnumber  of people who can actually achieve a Nobel  prize\r\n\r\nand  the number of people who become world-famous is very\r\n\r\nfew.   Our  education  system is for  Singaporeans  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.  This is what will be the measure of success.   We\r\n\r\nwill  know  these  recommendations  have  succeeded  when\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are no longer afraid of foreign talent, when\r\n\r\nwe are no longer afraid of competition, when we know that\r\n\r\nwe are innovative, creative enough to take on competition\r\n\r\nand  foreign talent anywhere, anytime, any place. We will\r\n\r\nknow  we  have succeeded when our SMEs are not afraid  of\r\n\r\nour  GLCs. We will know we have succeeded when we  become\r\n\r\ninternationally known, not just for being  good  stewards\r\n\r\nbut  good  CEOs and good leaders. We will  know  we  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded  when you signal and the person actually  drops\r\n\r\nback and lets you change your lane.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am heartened that\r\n\r\nall  Members who have spoken thus far have supported  the\r\n\r\nmotion  and the recommendations of the JC/Upper Secondary\r\n\r\nEducation Review Committee.  However, not a few have said\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  these  changes were good and worthy of support  and\r\n\r\nimplementation should be extended to the majority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, MP Amy Khor and NMP Dr Jennifer Lee have\r\n\r\ncalled these educational changes to be extended to  more,\r\n\r\nso  that more can benefit. And, today, Mr Iswaran  echoes\r\n\r\nthis  call.   Intended  or not, these  points  raised  by\r\n\r\nspeakers  before  me may have given the wrong  impression\r\n\r\nthat  MOE  would  be  neglecting the majority,  as  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  largely benefit the top 10% who, in Dr Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee's   words,   \"are  more  than  able   to   fend   for\r\n\r\nthemselves''.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to address this concern. Implicit\r\n\r\nin their comments that MOE may be neglecting the majority\r\n\r\nare  two assumptions, both which are debatable.   One  is\r\n\r\nthat   parity  of  attention  is  achieved  through   the\r\n\r\nprovision   of  similar  programmes;  and,  two,   better\r\n\r\ntreatment is accorded to the top echelons of our students\r\n\r\nat the expense of the weaker students.  Sir, let me state\r\n\r\nin umabiguous terms as clearly and succinctly as I can  - when   it   comes  to  paying  heed  to  the  educational\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  the  masses,  especially  the  weaker\r\n\r\nstudents, we have, we do, we will continue to do so.  Let\r\n\r\nme substantiate my assertions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have. Educational reforms for the masses,\r\n\r\nas  hon. Members Cedric Foo and Wee Siew Kim have pointed\r\n\r\nout,  require enormous will and courage and effects take,\r\n\r\nin  political  time-scales, well, forever, which  is  why\r\n\r\nbeyond the political dimensions, countries which had  the\r\n\r\ntemerity  and succeeded in educational reforms have  done\r\n\r\nso  because of added strategic reasons.  Those that  have\r\n\r\nsucceded are like Singapore, Ireland and Denmark,  island\r\n\r\nstates  or  countries  surrounded  by  competitors   with\r\n\r\ngreater hinterlands and resources.  To survive, we had to\r\n\r\nget  the  best,  not from some but all  our  people.   In\r\n\r\ncontrast, large countries with better resources have  had\r\n\r\nless strategic reasons to enable the masses to `level up'\r\n\r\nin  education.  Do not get me wrong.  All countries  want\r\n\r\nit but the need to achieve that egalitarian goal is less\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nurgent    for   these   countries.    So,   like   Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary Koo Tsai Kee recounted, Bush Snr.\r\n\r\npromised reforms but like so many before and indeed after\r\n\r\nhim,  failed to deliver.  Politically, it is a card  they\r\n\r\nplay because people keep hoping that finally someone will\r\n\r\ndeliver.   And even if you do not, because so  many  have\r\n\r\npreviously failed, people forget.  So, when previous  MPs\r\n\r\ndeclared  that  we  should  also  pay  attention  to  the\r\n\r\nmajority,  I was bemused because it seems, in  Singapore,\r\n\r\neven  when you have succeeded magnificently, people  also\r\n\r\nforget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the last 20 years or so, since a similar\r\n\r\nmotion on educational reform standing in the name of  the\r\n\r\nthen Deputy Prime Minister Goh Keng Swee was accepted, we\r\n\r\nhave  been  doing just that  -  paying attention  to  the\r\n\r\nmasses, not those on the top.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. Prior to those educational\r\n\r\nreforms,  only  one  of two students completed  secondary\r\n\r\nschool education.  Even now, the adverse consequences are\r\n\r\nfelt.   This  is  the group of 400,000  or  so  that  NMP\r\n\r\nJennifer Lee alluded to.  But we broke the back  of  that\r\n\r\nproblem,   and   now  more  than  90%  finish   secondary\r\n\r\neducation.  The problem of masses of uneducated will  not\r\n\r\nbe  repeated.   So,  if I were asked  the  question,  who\r\n\r\nbenefited  the most from the educational efforts  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  20 years, I can objectively assert that it was  the\r\n\r\nmasses  and not the academically brightest.  Because,  as\r\n\r\nMembers themselves have said that in most countries, even\r\n\r\nin  the  USA, the rich and able are able to take care  of\r\n\r\nthemselves.   Streaming of aptitude and resources  occurs\r\n\r\nspontaneously  and to the disadvantage of the  less  able\r\n\r\nand less well off.  A strong central system is inherently\r\n\r\nstacked against the elite because it enables the rest  to\r\n\r\ncatch up.  This is exactly what happened in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1980, only 5% of each birth cohort went to\r\n\r\nuniversity.  Now, if you were in families of the 5%,  why\r\n\r\nwould  you  want it changed?  When others are less  able,\r\n\r\nwith  less  access  and untutored, there  would  be  less\r\n\r\ncompetition  and, yes, as many Members have mentioned it,\r\n\r\nless stress.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed,   this  occurs  in  the  States  even  now.    By\r\n\r\ngravitational affinity, students from the more  resourced\r\n\r\nfamilies  congregate  at  specific  schools  followed  by\r\n\r\nbetter  teachers.   They therefore do  better.   But,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we do not send all our best teachers  to  only\r\n\r\nRI  and  RGS.   We  spread  them out.   These  systematic\r\n\r\nchanges  opened up access to all and sundry.  As I  said,\r\n\r\nit  is school proof  -  any school will get you there  if\r\n\r\nyou have the aptitude.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the International Mathematics and Science\r\n\r\nCompetitions conducted a study and chose our students  at\r\n\r\nrandom.   And  as we have mentioned, our students  scored\r\n\r\nvery  highly.    In  Mathematics, 93%  scored  above  the\r\n\r\nmedian.  In Science, 80%.  Let me try to present this  in\r\n\r\nmathematical terms.  Mathematically, it means that if you\r\n\r\nclosed your eyes and plucked any student in any school in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  transported him to  an  equivalent  grade\r\n\r\nanywhere else in the world, even if the student was  91st\r\n\r\nout of 100 positions, he or she would be above average in\r\n\r\nthat system.  Is it any wonder that parents come back who\r\n\r\nhave  brought these students overseas and said how  their\r\n\r\nchildren `blossomed' when they went overseas?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, contrary to what was implied, we have enabled\r\n\r\nthe bottom 90% to be the best that they can be.  We added\r\n\r\nto  the  stress  because now one in every  four  students\r\n\r\ncomes  within  striking distance of  a  local  university\r\n\r\neducation.  And because we have grounded them so well  in\r\n\r\nfundamentals, about 40 to 50% of each cohort get a  local\r\n\r\nor overseas university degree finally.  40% get a diploma\r\n\r\nand  another 25% ITE certification, and this latter group\r\n\r\nwith above 80% employability, even in this recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Who is looking into the educational needs of the\r\n\r\nbottom  90%?\",  NMP  Jennifer Lee asked  yesterday.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has for the last 20 years, thank you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we do. Having raised the water level across\r\n\r\nour  nation,  are  we  now poised to spend  inappropriate\r\n\r\nresources only on the more able  -  cries of elitism?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot  so.  Minister Teo, because of these changes,  wanted\r\n\r\nto  convince  ourselves  at MOE  that  we  are  expending\r\n\r\nappropriate  resources  to  those  with  lesser  academic\r\n\r\naptitude.   He asked for comparable figures  of  spending\r\n\r\nbetween JC  and ITE students, ie, different ends  of  the\r\n\r\nspectrum  in  terms of academic ability of similar  ages.\r\n\r\nWe  did not quite know what the results would be, but the\r\n\r\nresults are illuminating and indeed gratifying.   Let  me\r\n\r\nshare them with you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, developmental cost. Both ITE and JC\r\n\r\ninstitutions cater to similar sized intakes, about  1,500\r\n\r\nstudents.   We  spend  $37  million  to  build  one   ITE\r\n\r\ninstitution and $36.8 million to build one JC.  MPs  know\r\n\r\nbecause they have seen it with their own eyes that we  do\r\n\r\nnot  shortchange  weaker  students,  when  it  comes   to\r\n\r\nfacilities!  In fact, equipment donated by industry, such\r\n\r\nas  in  the  case of Balestier ITE, can come  up  to  $10\r\n\r\nmillion more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, but you say, JC students get better and\r\n\r\ntherefore more expensive teaching.  Well, let us look  at\r\n\r\nthe  figures.  The recurrent operating cost for JC is $11\r\n\r\nmillion and $7,879 per student per year.  For ITE,  $10.5\r\n\r\nmillion and $8,030 per student per year.  The ITE student\r\n\r\nis  worth  102% compared to the JC student  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nspending.   And for both JC and ITE students,  Government\r\n\r\ncharges  for their education a `princely' sum  of  $25  a\r\n\r\nmonth.   Let  me  say that MOE does not a priori  provide\r\n\r\neducational  programmes to different aptitudes  based  on\r\n\r\nequivalent spending.  In other words, we do not start  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that  this  is the sum, we will  spend  the  same\r\n\r\namount for all groups.  That would be unenlightened.  Our\r\n\r\nguiding  principle has and will be, enable  each  student\r\n\r\naccording to his aptitude to realise his potential.   And\r\n\r\nfor  an  ITE  student  to  have 80%  employability  at  a\r\n\r\nstarting  salary of $1,300 is something we can  be  proud\r\n\r\nof.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we will continue to do so. Our educational\r\n\r\nsystem,  though  streamed and segmented by  aptitude  and\r\n\r\npedagogy, is nonetheless interconnected.  In other words,\r\n\r\nchanges  at any point will have an impact throughout  the\r\n\r\nsystem.   NMP  Jennifer  Lee  asked  another  intelligent\r\n\r\nquestion  -  and Mr Iswaran also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepeated it  -  if changes are to be effected, why did we\r\n\r\nchoose to start after the student has had about 6-8 years\r\n\r\nin  our current system? Our response is a practical  one.\r\n\r\nIt  is  easier to do and that is why we chose to work  at\r\n\r\nthe  `product'.   The University Sector  Review  is  also\r\n\r\nconcurrently  underway  and the recommendations  will  be\r\n\r\npresented in January.  The recommendations will reinforce\r\n\r\nand be aligned to the objectives of this present preview.\r\n\r\nAnd I believe to start at the end is a smart thing to do.\r\n\r\nIf  we  chose to start at the primary one level, we would\r\n\r\nhave  to  systematically train and enable all  45,000  of\r\n\r\nstudents and their teachers to effect these changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said educational reforms take quite long to\r\n\r\neffect, but some of us would wish to see changes  in  our\r\n\r\nchildren's  lifetime!  I also think it will work  because\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  by  their very nature,  respond  to  clear\r\n\r\nsignals.   Take  project  work in schools,  for  example.\r\n\r\nEven though it is not yet implemented as a criterion  for\r\n\r\nuniversity  admission,  already  project  work  has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  at the primary school level, as every  parent\r\n\r\nwho  has  to  spend nights preparing his child's  project\r\n\r\nwork  will  testify.   Similarly, the JC/Upper  Secondary\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  while  physically  affecting  only  10%\r\n\r\ninitially,  will have a leavening effect  on  the  entire\r\n\r\nsystem.  For example, once the specialised sports  school\r\n\r\nis  well  established, I foresee students  who  excel  in\r\n\r\nsports,  but  are  continuing in the mainstream  schools,\r\n\r\nparticipate in and upgrade through events in  the  sports\r\n\r\nschool.    Similarly, the Arts school,  the  Science  and\r\n\r\nMathematics schools will have spillover effects.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nthe  training of teachers to facilitate these  programmes\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  talked about will also have an  uplifting\r\n\r\neffect.   Singapore is small and teachers meet  regularly\r\n\r\nand    interact.   They  will  discuss  new  methods  and\r\n\r\nchallenge  outdated  ideas.   A  change  in  the  overall\r\n\r\neducational milieu will result and will make it easier to\r\n\r\neffect changes in the mainstream schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do, however, agree with Members who feel that\r\n\r\nthese changes may not reduce\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  workload.   Regardless  of  the  system  and  beyond\r\n\r\neducational goals, students will still want  to  go  that\r\n\r\nextra  mile, put in that extra hour of mugging to be  one\r\n\r\nup   on  his  fellow  students,  to  enter  into  a   top\r\n\r\nuniversity.   How  and should we ameliorate  this  drive?\r\n\r\nRealistically, we can only aim to influence not how  much\r\n\r\nbut  what they spend their time on.  That is why  the  JC\r\n\r\nreview calls for a contrasting subject to achieve breadth\r\n\r\nand  for  co-curricular activities to  be  considered  in\r\n\r\nuniversity admissions.  A recommendation which  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember John Chen, I am sure, would fully support,  as  it\r\n\r\nwould have enabled his `borderline example of a badminton\r\n\r\nplayer' who excelled in sports to enter university.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me reiterate that these changes do not in\r\n\r\nany  way signal that we are going to neglect the majority\r\n\r\nand  focus only on those who are more able.  We  continue\r\n\r\nto  be  guided by the vision of to each his  ability,  so\r\n\r\nthat we can get from each his best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the main recommendations made\r\n\r\nby theWhite Paper are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Introducing broad-based education and asking\r\n\r\nstudents to study both science and humanities subjects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Emphasising on thinking skills and not on contents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Enhancing students' communication skill and to\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be more creative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main arguments in support of the recommendations\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To remedy the problem of a lack of\r\n\r\ncommunication skill among our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To prepare the students with necessary\r\n\r\nqualities  needed  by  the new era of knowledge-intensive\r\n\r\neconomy; namely, independent thinking, broad-based knowledge and creativity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose if we accept the said two main arguments,\r\n\r\nI  would  say  that  this  White Paper  provides  a  very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and very thorough solution for  our  future\r\n\r\nneeds.   It  also  takes care of the likely  queries  and\r\n\r\ndoubts  resulting from the newly proposed  JC  structure.\r\n\r\nIt  could be said to be an almost perfect White Paper for\r\n\r\nthe JC educational reform.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after having carefully read the White\r\n\r\nPaper,  I  feel  that  there are many  points  which  are\r\n\r\ndebatable.  Firstly, in order to satisfy the needs of the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy, do we really need to have a very\r\n\r\nbroad-based education?  If it is going to be broad-based,\r\n\r\nthat  means  there will be no avenue for  specialisation.\r\n\r\nExcept  those  subjects  in the H3  level,  most  of  the\r\n\r\nsubjects  in  H2  and H1 levels will have lower  standard\r\n\r\nafter  the  recommended  reform.   The  results  of   the\r\n\r\nreformation will be contrary to the  requirements of  the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based   economy  which   requires   people   of\r\n\r\nspecialised  and  in-depth knowledge in specific  fields.\r\n\r\nThis  is because in the knowledge-based economy, we  must\r\n\r\nhave  some  unique or specialised knowledge  which  other\r\n\r\npeople  do  not  have,  so that  other  people  would  be\r\n\r\nprepared to pay a premium for the access to the knowledge\r\n\r\nor  in  order to benefit from the knowledge.  So who  are\r\n\r\nthe  people  who  can claim to possess  this  specialised\r\n\r\nknowledge?   I think they must be the specialists.   They\r\n\r\nare certainly the jack of all trades, and master of none.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Philip Yeo, Chairman of A*Star, made some highly\r\n\r\ncontroversial  remarks recently.   His  remarks  coincide\r\n\r\nsomewhat  with the point I am trying to raise  here.   He\r\n\r\nsaid  that in the field of bio-medical research, a  basic\r\n\r\nscience  degree  qualifies a person  only  to  wash  test\r\n\r\ntubes,  a Master's makes him an advanced washer.   A  PhD\r\n\r\nmakes  him  an  ordinary worker.  So Philip  Yeo's  point\r\n\r\nreally  hits the nail on the head, because if we want  to\r\n\r\ngo  into this economy where it is knowledge intensive, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  specialists rather than  generalists.   The\r\n\r\nProvost of NUS, Prof. Chong, was reported as saying  that\r\n\r\nthe  NUS  would  run  their own  JC  in  mathematics  and\r\n\r\nsciences to train the students\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith   the   right   aptitude  to   meet   specific   NUS\r\n\r\nrequirements.   He  meant  students  with  the  depth  in\r\n\r\nmathematics  and science knowledge and not  the  breadth.\r\n\r\nSo this recommendation to broaden the scope of curriculum\r\n\r\nwould  definitely  reduce the standard of  the  students.\r\n\r\nEven  if only 10% of the students read their subjects  at\r\n\r\nH3  level, the standard of the other subjects at H2 level\r\n\r\nwould   definitely  be  lower  than  before.   The  trend\r\n\r\nnowadays  seems  to  be  that, not  only  in  the  junior\r\n\r\ncolleges, even in the university, we are going  for  this\r\n\r\nbroad-based education.  I doubt this is really beneficial\r\n\r\nto  our students, and wonder whether it will satisfy  the\r\n\r\nneeds of our knowledge-intensive economy in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the promotion of thinking skills in our\r\n\r\ncurriculum.  I come from the science stream.  By learning\r\n\r\nthe  science subjects, it is already a good training  for\r\n\r\nour  logic  analytical skills.  In the university,  those\r\n\r\nwho are stronger in their studies will have no problem in\r\n\r\ntheir thinking skills.  But for those who are weaker, the\r\n\r\nthinking skill is actually very, very low.  But why is it\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  such a phenomenon?  I believe  this  has\r\n\r\nperhaps something to do with our system of assessment  in\r\n\r\nour  education system.  For the weaker students, they are\r\n\r\nnot  so  concerned  with  the  process  of  learning  but\r\n\r\nconcerned only with examination results.  So long as they\r\n\r\ncan pass the examination, it is not their concern whether\r\n\r\nthey have succeeded in enhancing their power of analysis,\r\n\r\ntheir power of thinking and power of problem solving.  To\r\n\r\nthem, all these are not important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion I asked a physics lecturer in a\r\n\r\njunior college why is it that the junior college students\r\n\r\nare  weak in their power of analysis and problem solving.\r\n\r\nHis answer came as a great surprise to me.  He said, \"Oh,\r\n\r\nof  course,  it  should be that, because  in  the  junior\r\n\r\ncollege  it  is  the teachers who do  the  analysis   and\r\n\r\nproblem  solving, not the students.\"   In  my  view,  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of enhancing the student's thinking  skill\r\n\r\nwould only be achievable if we do have a major reform  to\r\n\r\nour assessment methodology.  We must place attention to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  process  of  learning and not purely  based  on  the\r\n\r\nassessment  on  the paper and pen examination.   This  is\r\n\r\nparticularly important if we wish to enhance the thinking\r\n\r\nskill of the weaker students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the communication skills of our students.\r\n\r\nGenerally  speaking, if we want to compare the  level  of\r\n\r\nEnglish of our students with English in the UK and US,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  cannot  compare with them because  English  is\r\n\r\ntheir  mother tongue and they have a much better learning\r\n\r\nenvironment  for  good English communication  skill  than\r\n\r\nthat  in  Singapore.  In our case, we have to  learn  two\r\n\r\nlanguages  and  the students generally  use  Singlish  in\r\n\r\ntheir casual conversation.  On other occasions when  they\r\n\r\nare discussing more serious matters, like their homework,\r\n\r\nthey use their mother tongue.  Among the students in  our\r\n\r\nuniversities,  some  come  from  China.   In   order   to\r\n\r\naccommodate them and to show that they are not a  \"banana\r\n\r\nrace\"  (yellow  outside,  white  inside),  many  of   our\r\n\r\nstudents  use  Mandarin as their means of  communication.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is recommended in the report that we want  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  standard  of English communication  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents,  I  think  we have to endeavour  to  create  an\r\n\r\nenvironment  conducive to the students to communicate  in\r\n\r\nEnglish.  Apart from our bilingual principle that  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  changed, we have at least to create an environment in\r\n\r\nthe campus whereby English would be the main language  of\r\n\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that the science students are weaker in\r\n\r\nexpression than the arts students because when  they  are\r\n\r\nlearning  the science subjects like mathematics,  physics\r\n\r\nand  chemistry, not much language skills are needed. They\r\n\r\njust need to know the equations and symbols.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, the power of expression\r\n\r\ndoes  not  improve  with  their  subjects.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nwriting skill is stagnated before the JC level.   In  JC,\r\n\r\nthe  only  subject that involves writing is  the  General\r\n\r\nPaper  for the pure science students.  As far as I  know,\r\n\r\nthe students write less than one essay a month.  So\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow  could  the science students in the JC  possess  good\r\n\r\ncommunication skills?  Although it is recommended in this\r\n\r\nreport  that the communication skills of the students  be\r\n\r\nimproved, the only subject reported to have some links in\r\n\r\nachieving this objective is the Project Work and not very\r\n\r\nmuch elsewhere.   I hope the new amended curriculum would\r\n\r\ncreate more opportunities for our science students to  be\r\n\r\ntrained in this skill.  They should be given more chances\r\n\r\nto write and to express.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, improvement of creative thinking and\r\n\r\nwriting skills. In the project work, generally, a lot  of\r\n\r\ntechnicality would be involved.  Now, in JC 1 and  JC  2,\r\n\r\nif all the students spend two years doing these projects,\r\n\r\nthis  would  mean that, at any one time, there  would  be\r\n\r\nabout  24,000  projects being carried out simultaneously,\r\n\r\nand we can expect a lot of duplications.  I would like to\r\n\r\nknow  whether  or not we have any means  to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nstudents from copying from one another or duplicating the\r\n\r\nwork of others.  Some years later, the colleges will have\r\n\r\nreceived  more  than 10,000 reports on the project  works\r\n\r\nconducted  by  the students, and they are probably  quite\r\n\r\neasily  accessible  to  the  other  students.   The  good\r\n\r\nstudents  would  use them as reference,  and  the  weaker\r\n\r\nstudents  would just copy from them.  If this  becomes  a\r\n\r\ntrend,  then this project work will become like  a  joke,\r\n\r\nbecause  everyone would be plagiarising to get  admission\r\n\r\nto the university.  Besides, if every one of the students\r\n\r\nhas to do project work, a lot of space and facilities  in\r\n\r\nthe  school  would be needed.   Do our  JCs  have  enough\r\n\r\nfacilities  to  satisfy the needs of  the  students?   If\r\n\r\nthere is not, then the chances are more students will  go\r\n\r\nfor   the  software-type  of  projects  rather  than  the\r\n\r\npractical ones which involve more hardware.  We will  end\r\n\r\nup  with a lot of students doing theoretical work  rather\r\n\r\nthan practical work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we can see that this recommendation for project\r\n\r\nwork  will  have  a  lot of problems,  and  it  is  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent  from the traditional subjects.  If  we  cannot\r\n\r\nresolve this problem on the project work, it will  be  an\r\n\r\nobstacle for us to attain the target that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have  set out to achieve.  No doubt, our existing  JC\r\n\r\nsystem  is  not  a  perfect system.  There  are  inherent\r\n\r\nshortcomings and these shortcomings are reflected on  the\r\n\r\nweaker students, in other words, those who are unable  to\r\n\r\ncommunicate,  unable to analyse, unable to have  creative\r\n\r\nthinking.   Under this new system, although there  are  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  recommendations, which are structural in nature,\r\n\r\nwe  must also look squarely at the existing weaknesses in\r\n\r\nour  existing  system.   If these  weaknesses  cannot  be\r\n\r\nresolved first, it would be difficult for the new  system\r\n\r\nto attain the objectives set out in the White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  too  would like to fully support the  motion  to\r\n\r\nadopt  the  recommendations of the Review Committee  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  Junior College and Upper Secondary Education.\r\n\r\nIndeed  the Report is a very excellent blueprint to  take\r\n\r\nthe JC and the Upper Secondary Education into the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the key is summarised in paragraph 26 of the\r\n\r\nreport,  which  states that \"The focus of education  must\r\n\r\nshift  from  efficiency  to diversity,  from  knowing  to\r\n\r\nthinking,  and  from fitting people to specific  jobs  to\r\n\r\nequipping  them for lifelong learning and creating  their\r\n\r\nown opportunities.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact this is a very powerful statement with\r\n\r\nintent to empower people.  It also sums up where we  have\r\n\r\nbeen and where we want to be.\r\n\r\nIn   the  past,  our  strategy  has  been  to  focus   on\r\n\r\nefficiency,  on  knowledge and  on  fitting  people  into\r\n\r\nspecific  jobs.   Every  strategy,  indeed  in  business,\r\n\r\ncannot be perfect, but the bottom line counts.  And,  the\r\n\r\nbottom  line is that it has produced the results we  have\r\n\r\ntoday.  It has served us well as a small and fast growing\r\n\r\nnation  and has brought us clearly to where we are today.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  think all Members have also agreed that in  going\r\n\r\nforward,  we  have  got to change our  educational  focus\r\n\r\nbecause the world we live in is vastly different.  We now\r\n\r\nhave a global economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation explodes all around us, and changes the world\r\n\r\nand our chosen careers. It is just inevitable and we just\r\n\r\nhave got to continue with life-long learning in order  to\r\n\r\nstay relevant.  And businesses too are focusing on people\r\n\r\nwho  are  creative,  people with  unique  ideas,  problem\r\n\r\nsolvers who are able to communicate the ideas as well  as\r\n\r\nfocusing on people, on their well-being.  And competition\r\n\r\nis  clearly demanding that all of us have got to  enhance\r\n\r\nour  productivity in more ways than one to produce  goods\r\n\r\nand services better, quicker and cheaper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most of the solutions can be shaped by education\r\n\r\nbecause  education is a powerful tool to  reshape  minds,\r\n\r\nreshape  attitudes  and reshape  behaviours.   So  it  is\r\n\r\ntimely  that  we relook and re-challenge our  educational\r\n\r\nsystem to take us forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, just like any investment, we look for\r\n\r\nthe  best yields.  Happily, now, we can afford a lot more\r\n\r\nof   the   recommendations  put  forward  by  the  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee so that we can embark on broad-based education,\r\n\r\nwe  can  do more for our students so that they can  spend\r\n\r\nmore time on non-academic projects, project work, as  has\r\n\r\nbeen said, as well as on character building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a professional accountant and one trained with\r\n\r\nspecialist  skills, I am a firm believer  in  broad-based\r\n\r\neducation, general-based education, at all levels.   Most\r\n\r\nof  my  colleagues trained in Europe, in US  and  UK  are\r\n\r\ntrained in that way.  They first of all have to obtain  a\r\n\r\nGeneral Degree first and we would prefer them to  have  a\r\n\r\ndiscipline, other than accounting.  We would prefer  them\r\n\r\nto  have  a degree in philosophy, in engineering,  before\r\n\r\nthey  embark on their professional qualifications.   This\r\n\r\nhas  made  much  better multi-faceted professionals,  not\r\n\r\nonly  effective  in  their  own  individual's  sphere  of\r\n\r\nprofession, but also well-equipped in business as well as\r\n\r\nsocial  settings.   I  think this  should  apply  to  all\r\n\r\nprofessionals, as well as technicians, that create people\r\n\r\nas  well.  Just as we have moved away from the idea  that\r\n\r\naccountants should be locked up in backrooms,  buried  in\r\n\r\nledgers, we should also move away from the idea that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnicians should hide behind machines and work  quietly\r\n\r\nwith  their  hands.  All of us got to  be  equipped  with\r\n\r\nmulti-faceted  skills  so  that  we  can   operate   more\r\n\r\neffectively as leaders and managers in the global economy\r\n\r\nand global marketplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the concerns on JC and upper secondary\r\n\r\neducation,  my  little concern has been answered  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State, and what further  changes  would  be\r\n\r\nbrought  about  by changes introduced at one  level,  the\r\n\r\nbefore  and the after.  Before, being at the primary  and\r\n\r\nlower  education, lower secondary education level to  set\r\n\r\nthe scene for the broad-based education to be experienced\r\n\r\nat the upper secondary education level, and the after, at\r\n\r\nthe  tertiary  education so that students  who  had  been\r\n\r\nbrought  up in a different and more challenging way  will\r\n\r\nstill  continue  to  receive the  same  level  of  mental\r\n\r\nstimulation and challenges under the new system.  I think\r\n\r\nthis  is nitty-gritty stuff that MOE would take care  of.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  foresee  is an education system which  will  get\r\n\r\ninvariably more and more complex and I think it cannot be\r\n\r\nhelped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has already been said about the educational\r\n\r\nreforms, about execution and about training teachers.  So\r\n\r\nI  would  not dwell on them.  I would like to add further\r\n\r\ncomments on reforms beyond the educational reforms.  When\r\n\r\nI  first read the Report, I said, \"Wow, as a parent, this\r\n\r\nis  going  to cause more stress for parents and  students\r\n\r\nalike.\"  I think probably more so for parents.  As it is,\r\n\r\nour existing streaming system is causing much stress.  So\r\n\r\nas  we  open new channels, a superior education  for  our\r\n\r\nbest and our brightest, parents, I feel, would invariably\r\n\r\nget more pressured to ensure that the students make it to\r\n\r\nthis  category.  They will get a crack at  Primary  6  to\r\n\r\nmake it to one of these Integrated Programmes, if not  at\r\n\r\nSecondary  2,  and  for  the  late  bright  bloomers   at\r\n\r\nSecondary 4.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report did acknowledge that such changes would\r\n\r\nbring about some level of elitism.  But it was felt  that\r\n\r\nit was inevitable.  And I must say I agree.  I agree\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  streaming, I agree with segmentation, I agree  with\r\n\r\nsetting  up  new channels for our best and our  brightest\r\n\r\nbecause these are the very people who will pull the  rest\r\n\r\nof society forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not against elitism because it is a fact\r\n\r\nof life.  It is required given the constraints as a small\r\n\r\ncountry.   But it is important to recognise  the  stress,\r\n\r\nand  we  ought  to  recognise and  manage  the  resultant\r\n\r\nstress.  I  also agree that much of the stress  is  self-imposed  -  by society and by parents.  All parents  want\r\n\r\nthe  very  best for their students to excel in everything\r\n\r\nfrom  academic to arts, to music, everything is just  not\r\n\r\nrealistic, but yet we push ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read the New York Times article recently and it\r\n\r\nsaid  the Singapore problem is experienced elsewhere  and\r\n\r\nit  emphasised  that children must also lead  a  balanced\r\n\r\nlife.  To the Americans, they said they also need time to\r\n\r\nveg out.  In our lingo, just switch off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is heart warming that the Report has sent out\r\n\r\na  very important signal where they recommended that  the\r\n\r\nhours  be  reduced for each subject.  Some  Members  have\r\n\r\nargued  that  they should be reduced even  further.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  is  important is that they have  sent  out  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  signal that the hours ought to be reduced  and\r\n\r\nmore hours be spent doing other things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think parents ought to take cue to lessen the\r\n\r\npressure on their children.  But educational reforms  can\r\n\r\nonly  do so much.  At the end of the day, society,  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole,  must  also change its mindset  and  seek  a  more\r\n\r\nbalanced  life.   Because  we can  be  a  high  achieving\r\n\r\nnation, but if we are completely stressed out, we  become\r\n\r\nineffective and it becomes a case of diminishing returns.\r\n\r\nIt  is  also  good  that  the Report  therefore  is  also\r\n\r\nrecommending  that  we  alleviate  the  pressure  on  our\r\n\r\nstudents by allowing them to seek and to fulfil their own\r\n\r\ninterest  and their own inclination.  Because  when  they\r\n\r\npursue  their  interest,  they excel  through  enjoyment.\r\n\r\nFrequently, students are channelled into programmes where\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  no aptitude or motivation for.  And this is because\r\n\r\nof  peer  pressure or family expectations.  And it  is  a\r\n\r\ntragic  waste of resources both on the point of  view  of\r\n\r\nthe individual as well as for society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, another side effect of this proposal, elitism,\r\n\r\nis  of  course labelling.  We already have so many labels\r\n\r\nin  the  marketplace  - Normal, Express,  scholars,  non-scholars  and  we  have  got  elites  versus  non-elites.\r\n\r\nAgain, I like to emphasise that I am not against elitism.\r\n\r\nBut it is important to recognise it and the downside that\r\n\r\nit  would  produce a greater divide on society  and  will\r\n\r\nproduce more of the so-called quitters in society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would also like to add that the elites\r\n\r\nthemselves would also form a pool of potential  quitters.\r\n\r\nAs  we  raise the bar for our best and brightest,  as  we\r\n\r\ncreate  more savvy, more creative people, more  thinkers,\r\n\r\nmore   leaders,  they  would  also  tend  to  be   brash,\r\n\r\nopinionated and self-centred.  So it is also important as\r\n\r\nwe teach them humility, we also have to alter our social,\r\n\r\nas  well  as political framework, in order to engage  and\r\n\r\naccommodate  a  new  breed  of  Singaporeans  who   might\r\n\r\notherwise pack up and go, if they are not satisfied.   So\r\n\r\nwe need more social reform.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the decades, we have also evolved as a nation\r\n\r\nof  small families, one or two siblings or no siblings at\r\n\r\nall,  both parents working, the womenfolk getting  better\r\n\r\neducated, they will pursue their aspirations and you will\r\n\r\nhave  more of family members working in the future.  What\r\n\r\nwe  get  is  latchkey kids, we get kids subject  to  maid\r\n\r\nculture,  we  get lonely kids, and we also get  ambitious\r\n\r\nand guilt ridden parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So more and more the traditional discipline and\r\n\r\nsupport system of the family will get eroded and we  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  face the consequences of this reality  squarely.\r\n\r\nSo  what I would like to suggest, and I wonder whether it\r\n\r\nwould be possible, is whether it would be reasonable  for\r\n\r\nsome of these family responsibilities to be undertaken by\r\n\r\nthe  State.   Whether we could have,  on  a  much  bigger\r\n\r\nscale,  across national level, after-school care for  our\r\n\r\nchildren so that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  can  be minded, so that the value system  and  life\r\n\r\nskills  can  be better developed, better honed.   Because\r\n\r\nwhen  our  children get better cared, they become  better\r\n\r\nadjusted individuals and they will do better, not only in\r\n\r\nterms  of  academic,  but in terms of  pursuit  of  other\r\n\r\ninterests,  in  terms of music and arts, it  will  create\r\n\r\nteamwork, it will create enjoyment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about music and arts, again, it is great\r\n\r\nthat the Report is recommending academies for music,  the\r\n\r\narts, the drama, and so on.  But it can only flourish  if\r\n\r\nour society places value on such areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sportsmen cannot just wait to win gold medals at\r\n\r\nASEAN,  the Olympics, the Commonwealth Games before  they\r\n\r\nget rewarded.  Even just being good, and not world-class,\r\n\r\nthey  must  earn  a living.  So we have  to  create  real\r\n\r\neconomic opportunities for these people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wonder whether our new commitment can also be\r\n\r\nendorsed  to  the  highest  level,  in  terms  of   State\r\n\r\nscholarships, whether the President's scholarships can be\r\n\r\noffered  for  the  music, the arts, the drama  and  film-making.  It is all very well that we develop our best and\r\n\r\nour  talented in particular fields.  At the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nday,  I  agree that one of the primary goals of education\r\n\r\nmust  be  to meet the needs of our economy and to provide\r\n\r\njobs and gainful employment for our young when they leave\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State has very positively confirmed\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry of Education has done and will  always\r\n\r\ndo  more  for the greater masses, and this is  important.\r\n\r\nBecause the true test of the success of our schools  must\r\n\r\nbe   the   preparation  and  motivation  of  the  greater\r\n\r\nmajority.   And  it  will  be wonderful  if  the  greater\r\n\r\nmajority, especially the less academically inclined,  the\r\n\r\nlate   bloomers,  can  be  motivated  to  excel  and   to\r\n\r\ncontribute effectively to our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, and this is noted in the Report,\r\n\r\neducation  for all must be a lifelong process, a  process\r\n\r\nwhich extends from infancy to the end of one's life.   So\r\n\r\nwe must create a learning society which will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp  us  to  progress  and  prosper  in  a  world  where\r\n\r\ncreativity  and knowledge clearly rule.  So  the  primary\r\n\r\ngoals of education must be, firstly, to provide our young\r\n\r\npreparation  for lifelong learning; secondly,  to  launch\r\n\r\nthem into careers where their aptitude, ambition and  the\r\n\r\nskills match; and thirdly, to continuously develop  their\r\n\r\npotential throughout their adult years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an easy subject. And indeed, it must\r\n\r\nextend  beyond the educational reforms in order  to  draw\r\n\r\nthe  true potential of the next generation.  We have  got\r\n\r\nto look at the total picture - the family, the social and\r\n\r\nthe political framework.  We have got an enormous task at\r\n\r\nhand.   I do not envy the Ministry of Education.  But  by\r\n\r\njust  recognising the nature of the task, I think we have\r\n\r\ntaken  major steps towards tackling it.  There can  never\r\n\r\nbe  a  perfect and all-encompassing solution.  We  cannot\r\n\r\ncure  all the problems at the same time, and we must  not\r\n\r\npostpone improvements today, taking one step at a time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I commend the Report.

It is therefore appropriate  that\r\n\r\nthe  Whip  be  lifted on this debate, so that  when  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  vote on the motion they will do so  not  because\r\n\r\nthey  have  been instructed by the Government  Whip,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  they have studied the proposed changes  and  are\r\n\r\npersonally  convinced  that  the  changes,  even   though\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  implement and unsettling  to  parents  and\r\n\r\nstudents, are nevertheless necessary, if Singapore is  to\r\n\r\nnurture a generation of students who are well prepared to\r\n\r\nface  a  different world from that experienced  by  their\r\n\r\nparents in the first 37 years of our independence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the education system of a country cannot be\r\n\r\ndivorced from the country's economic circumstances.   For\r\n\r\nSingapore,  our education system has evolved in  response\r\n\r\nto  changes to Singapore's economy and society.  Prior to\r\n\r\nour  independence in 1965, when we were a British  colony\r\n\r\nand  our  economy  depended on trade  and  servicing  the\r\n\r\nBritish garrison in Singapore, there was no real need for\r\n\r\nwidespread education of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the British authorities concentrated\r\n\r\non  nurturing a small number of English language  schools\r\n\r\nto  educate  clerks and a few professionals, particularly\r\n\r\nin medicine and law, to assist the Colonial Government to\r\n\r\nrun   what   was   then  basically  a   simple   economy.\r\n\r\nConsequently,  large numbers of Singapore  children  were\r\n\r\neducated  in  vernacular  schools,  where  teaching   was\r\n\r\nconducted  in  Chinese,  Malay  and  Tamil,  and  largely\r\n\r\noutside the purview of the Department of Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After our independence in 1965, the need was for a\r\n\r\nnational  integrated  system of education,  with  uniform\r\n\r\ncharacteristics which would be taught to all children  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   regardless  of  their   race   or   language\r\n\r\nbackground.  A national system of education proved to  be\r\n\r\nenormously   difficult   to   realise,   with   political\r\n\r\ndisturbances and even communal riots in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1960s and 1970s disrupting the process of integrating the\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A landmark in educational development in Singapore\r\n\r\nwas  the adoption by Parliament in March 1979 of the  Goh\r\n\r\nKeng  Swee  Report  on the Ministry  of  Education  which\r\n\r\nshaped  our  present education system, with streaming  at\r\n\r\nprimary and secondary schools to enable children to study\r\n\r\nat  a  pace  appropriate to their intellectual abilities.\r\n\r\nThe  success of streaming in our schools can be  seen  in\r\n\r\nthe  dramatic fall in the secondary school drop-out  rate\r\n\r\nfrom 13% of each Primary 1 cohort of students in 1978  to\r\n\r\njust  2.7%  last year.  The primary school drop-out  rate\r\n\r\nhas similarly fallen from 6% for each cohort of Primary 1\r\n\r\nstudents  in  1978 to almost zero - actually,  only  0.3%\r\n\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore is admired throughout the world for\r\n\r\nour  success  in  educating students of all  intellectual\r\n\r\ncapabilities, not only the gifted students but  also  the\r\n\r\naverage students and all social classes.  Our schools  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, whether the elite independent schools  or  the\r\n\r\nmore  numerous neighbourhood schools, are all  well-built\r\n\r\nand  well-equipped, and give to every child in Singapore,\r\n\r\nno matter what is his or her social class or intellectual\r\n\r\ncapability,  at least 10 years of basic education,  which\r\n\r\nwill  enable  the  child  to proceed  further  to  junior\r\n\r\ncollege,  polytechnic or Institute of Technical Education\r\n\r\nand,  from  then,  on to university for  those  with  the\r\n\r\ndetermination and ability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for Education from 1985 to 1991, I\r\n\r\nbuilt  on  the solid foundation laid down by Dr Goh  Keng\r\n\r\nSwee to fill out the education structure by upgrading our\r\n\r\nschools'  physical infrastructure, improving the training\r\n\r\nof  our teachers, and emphasising the critical role  that\r\n\r\nprincipals  play in motivating and guiding  teachers  and\r\n\r\nstudents in the search for excellence.  Over the last  10\r\n\r\nyears,  subsequent Ministers for Education - Mr Lee  Yock\r\n\r\nSuan and, now, RAdm Teo Chee Hean - further improved  the\r\n\r\nsystem   with   innovative   measures,   such   as   mass\r\n\r\ncustomisation  and encouraging the learning  of  critical\r\n\r\nthinking skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as I have said, we have an education system\r\n\r\nin  Singapore which is admired throughout the world, even\r\n\r\nin  developed countries like the US and Europe, and which\r\n\r\ndelivers a high standard of education to virtually  every\r\n\r\nchild  in  Singapore.  If the system is working so  well,\r\n\r\nthe  natural question to ask is:  why then do we have  to\r\n\r\nchange it?  Why try to fix the machine which is operating\r\n\r\nsmoothly and delivering the goods?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why we have to change our education\r\n\r\nsystem  is  because  the world has changed,  and  changed\r\n\r\ndramatically.  We could have carried on with the  present\r\n\r\nsystem for possibly the next 10 years, making adjustments\r\n\r\nhere  and  there  to  meet difficulties  or  to  fill  in\r\n\r\ninadequacies as they arise.  But when confronted  with  a\r\n\r\nmajor   change   in   the  operating  environment,   such\r\n\r\nincremental   adjustments  do  not  solve  the   problem.\r\n\r\nInstead,  they  aggravate  the  problem  by  perpetuating\r\n\r\npractices that should be jettisoned, if a country  is  to\r\n\r\nmove ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vivid example of how small incremental changes do\r\n\r\nnot  solve  but merely aggravate a basic problem  is  the\r\n\r\nresponse  by  successive  Japanese  governments  to   the\r\n\r\nchronic problems in the Japanese economy.  Japan  had  an\r\n\r\nenormous  record of economic success for  three  decades,\r\n\r\nfrom  the beginning of the 1960s to the end of the 1980s.\r\n\r\nJapan  as  Number  One, the influential book  written  by\r\n\r\nHarvard  Professor  Ezra Vogel received  wide  publicity.\r\n\r\nNations  in  search of development were urged to  emulate\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese  way  of doing business.   Japan's  leading\r\n\r\nposition  in the world economy's sweepstakes came  to  an\r\n\r\nend  in  the  late  1980s when the world  moved  from  an\r\n\r\nessentially manufacturing based economy to an innovation,\r\n\r\nknowledge-driven economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new economy, Japan's strengths of group\r\n\r\ncohesion,    incremental   improvements   and   life-time\r\n\r\nemployment systems hindered rather than promoted economic\r\n\r\nprogress.    Many  commentators,  both   in   Japan   and\r\n\r\nelsewhere,  have  come  to the conclusion  that  for  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  economy  to  revive, a major  restructuring  of\r\n\r\nJapan's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomic  and  monetary policies is necessary,  and  that\r\n\r\nminor  adjustments  would only prolong  the  deflationary\r\n\r\nslowdown in Japan, which has now lasted for more  than  a\r\n\r\ndecade.  As Japan shows no sign of embarking  on  such  a\r\n\r\nmajor  restructuring  of  its economy,  there  is  little\r\n\r\nexpectation  that the Japanese economy will  recover  its\r\n\r\nformer vibrancy in the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the two decades of the 1980s and the 1990s,\r\n\r\nSingapore,   in  general,  enjoyed,  despite   occasional\r\n\r\nhiccups  in  1985 and 1998, a very favourable combination\r\n\r\nof  factors that enabled a small export-oriented  economy\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore to achieve high growth.  After struggling\r\n\r\nin  the  1970s,  the  US  economy  began  getting  effect\r\n\r\ntogether  in the 1980s.  Companies restructured,  slimmed\r\n\r\ndown,  took advantage of the latest developments in real-time   information  technology  systems   and   generally\r\n\r\nachieved  a sustained rise in productivity in the  United\r\n\r\nStates,  which  was  not only higher  but  several  times\r\n\r\nhigher  than  that experienced in previous decades.   The\r\n\r\nwhole  world,  including Singapore,  benefited  from  the\r\n\r\nstrong  growth  of  the US economy, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\n1990s.    And  in  addition  to  a  buoyant  US  economy,\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia was also rapidly growing with  the  tiger\r\n\r\neconomies  of the East Asia being hailed as  the  fastest\r\n\r\ngrowing and most promising economic region in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these favourable developments however came to an\r\n\r\nabrupt  end with the Asian financial crisis in  1998  and\r\n\r\nthe  meltdown of the dot.com and technology boom  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  in  2000.  As the United  States  is  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  locomotive of the world's economy, a slowdown  in\r\n\r\nthe  United States has repercussions not only within  the\r\n\r\nUnited States but also throughout the world.  When the US\r\n\r\neconomy   began  to  slow  down  in  2000,  the   initial\r\n\r\nexpectation among many economists was that it would  take\r\n\r\nperhaps 18 months, at most 24 months, for the slowdown to\r\n\r\nrun  its  course  and after that, the  US  economy  would\r\n\r\nsettle to a new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbase from which it would grow again.  What is clear today\r\n\r\nis  that this period of adjustment is going to be  longer\r\n\r\nthan had been expected in 2001 or even earlier this year.\r\n\r\nHow  long this period of adjustment will be is a question\r\n\r\nwhich is perplexing the best economic minds in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of the US slowdown are being felt\r\n\r\nthroughout the world, including in Singapore.  Due to the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  the  US  slowdown and the stagnation  of  the\r\n\r\nregion's economies, our economy turned down sharply  with\r\n\r\nnegative growth last year and slow growth this year.   In\r\n\r\nview  of the current economic and security uncertainties,\r\n\r\nthe outlook for the Singapore economy is cloudy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even after the world economy has recovered,\r\n\r\nSingapore   will   be   faced  with  different   economic\r\n\r\ncircumstances  from those we enjoyed  during  the  1990s.\r\n\r\nFor  one  thing, there will be more competition with  the\r\n\r\nentry  of China into the world market.  In the long  run,\r\n\r\nChina  will make a positive contribution to world  growth\r\n\r\nwith  its  large domestic market.  But in  the  immediate\r\n\r\nfuture, China will present fierce competition for foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments.   With its large reserves of skilled  labour\r\n\r\nat  very low cost, China will exert deflationary pressure\r\n\r\non  prices world-wide and be a strong economic competitor\r\n\r\nto  countries throughout the world, including  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs  a small open economy, Singapore will have to continue\r\n\r\nto  rely on attracting multi-national corporations (MNCs)\r\n\r\nto locate their operations, particularly manufacturing in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the competition, we have fortunately been\r\n\r\nable  to  hold  our  own  in  attracting  foreign  direct\r\n\r\ninvestments  (FDIs).   EDB  expects  manufacturing  fixed\r\n\r\nasset  investment commitment this year to remain at about\r\n\r\nS$9  billion,  with  more  than  two-thirds  coming  from\r\n\r\nforeign  investors.  However, to progress ahead, we  need\r\n\r\nto move up the value chain and restructure our economy to\r\n\r\ncomplement  our MNC base with a larger base  of  domestic\r\n\r\nenterprises  and  entrepreneurial  companies.    As   our\r\n\r\neconomy  becomes more sophisticated, our  people  require\r\n\r\ndifferent  skills to survive and thrive in an environment\r\n\r\nof rapid and drastic change.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At independence, what Singapore needed to do was to\r\n\r\nindustralise  rapidly  to  create  a  large   number   of\r\n\r\nrelatively  unsophisticated  jobs  to  absorb  the  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Singaporeans who were unemployed or  entering\r\n\r\nthe  workforce.  In the 1970s and the 1980s, we moved  up\r\n\r\nthe  skill  and  value chain, attracting industries  that\r\n\r\nneeded   large   numbers  of  trained  technicians   with\r\n\r\ntechnical skills at the polytechnic and the Institute  of\r\n\r\nTechnical  Education  level.  As our  enterprises  became\r\n\r\nmore  capital-intensive  and sophisticated,  and  as  the\r\n\r\nsupply  marketing chain became more integrated  into  the\r\n\r\nworld's  logistics, it became necessary for us to educate\r\n\r\nmore  professionals with university degrees.   Now,  with\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge-based economy and our move into new  areas\r\n\r\nlike  the  life sciences, we not only need better-trained\r\n\r\nand innovative people, but also people with post-graduate\r\n\r\neducation at the Masters and PhD levels.  All these  will\r\n\r\nensure that we can keep ahead of the competition of  low-cost countries like our neighbours and China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an uncertain economic climate, it will also be\r\n\r\nmore  difficult  for companies to rely on products  which\r\n\r\nhave  long  production runs.  Companies will have  to  be\r\n\r\nflexible and change their products more frequently.  This\r\n\r\nputs  a  premium on having Singaporeans who are not  only\r\n\r\nwell-educated but who also have a flexible frame of  mind\r\n\r\nand  a nimbleness to cope with more rapid changes in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  economic  environment.   Sir,  in  today's\r\n\r\nworld,  competency in skills is necessary but  no  longer\r\n\r\nsufficient  for  economic success.  For  our  economy  to\r\n\r\nsucceed, our people need not only to be skilled but  also\r\n\r\nbe flexible and innovative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new junior college curriculum and diversified\r\n\r\nupper secondary school system seek to nurture flexibility\r\n\r\nand   innovation  in  our  students  by  making  the   JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum  more broad-based and providing more  latitude\r\n\r\nfor  our schools and junior colleges to provide education\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  are better tailored to  the  needs  and\r\n\r\ncapabilities  of  their respective cohorts  of  students.\r\n\r\nThe  new  system is a radical departure from the  present\r\n\r\nsystem\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  the scope for a junior college or secondary school\r\n\r\nto go its own way is kept within fairly narrow latitudes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new system, more initiatives will be given to\r\n\r\njunior  colleges and secondary schools to decide  how  to\r\n\r\nteach  subjects  and  how to prepare their  students  for\r\n\r\nschool-leaving or university entrance examinations.  Sir,\r\n\r\nimplementing  the new system will not be easy.   A  whole\r\n\r\ngeneration  of  teachers will have to be  re-educated  in\r\n\r\norder  to  teach  the new curriculum and, eventually,  we\r\n\r\nwill  need  our  own  examination  system  in  order   to\r\n\r\ncomplement  the  new  JC curriculum and  upper  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  structure.  Constructing a new examination system\r\n\r\nis difficult for a small country like Singapore.  MOE has\r\n\r\nwisely chosen to continue to work with the University  of\r\n\r\nCambridge,  Local  Examination  Syndicate,  to  keep  the\r\n\r\nSingapore-Cambridge   \"A\"   level   brand   name    while\r\n\r\nimplementing  the new JC curriculum and  upper  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  structure to allow schools to take various routes\r\n\r\nto prepare their students to sit for a variety of school-leaving    examinations   including   the   \"A\"   levels,\r\n\r\nInternational Baccalaureate or the American SAT I and II.\r\n\r\nWith  more  experience,  we will eventually  be  able  to\r\n\r\nsettle  on our own examination system which is  not  only\r\n\r\nrigorous and appropriate for our own needs but which will\r\n\r\nbe internationally recognised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new upper secondary school system also provides\r\n\r\nfor  the introduction of private schools.  I welcome this\r\n\r\ninitiative  because  it promotes  competition.   We  have\r\n\r\ndeveloped  our  national  secondary  schools  and  junior\r\n\r\ncolleges  to  a stage where they are world-class.   I  am\r\n\r\nconfident that our junior colleges and secondary  schools\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to  meet  the  competition  from  private\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, MOE could also consider allowing\r\n\r\nmore  flexibility  in  allowing Singaporean  children  to\r\n\r\nattend  foreign systems schools.  This will help to  ease\r\n\r\nthe worries of returning Singaporeans about the education\r\n\r\nof  their  children  and will spur  our  own  schools  to\r\n\r\nachieve new heights of excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Mr Speaker, Sir, we need a new junior\r\n\r\ncollege  curriculum and upper secondary school  structure\r\n\r\nbecause  the  world  has changed.   If  we  continue  the\r\n\r\npresent  system, making adjustments when necessary,  this\r\n\r\nwill  only  defer  the changes which will  ultimately  be\r\n\r\nnecessary.   It is better for us to grasp the  nettle  by\r\n\r\nthe  thorns and change the system so that we can keep our\r\n\r\neducation  system abreast and up-to-date and prepare  our\r\n\r\nstudents to face the future with confidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we embark into the 21st century, these changes to\r\n\r\nthe  junior college curriculum and upper secondary school\r\n\r\nstructure will be among the most important steps that  we\r\n\r\ncan make in the process of remaking Singapore.  Much work\r\n\r\nlies ahead for the Ministry of Education to translate the\r\n\r\nproposed   changes   into   workable   procedures.    But\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the bumpy road ahead, I urge all  Members\r\n\r\nof  this  House not to let down our children but to  have\r\n\r\nthe  courage  to attack this problem head-on and  endorse\r\n\r\nchanges proposed in the MOE's report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper for today be exempted at this day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom  the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. -  [Mr  Mah\r\n\r\nBow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>JUNIOR COLLEGE/UPPER SECONDARY EDUCATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  would like to use the following  three\r\n\r\ncriteria to evaluate the recommendations of this report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, are the recommendations of this report in\r\n\r\nkeeping with the direction of the time?  Secondly,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  different strengths with opportunities to  give  full\r\n\r\nplay  to  their potential?  Thirdly, does  it  result  in\r\n\r\ndisadvantages for the weaker students?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in this motion before the House, this report\r\n\r\nproposes  a  general  educational  direction  to   better\r\n\r\ndevelop the students' thinking, communication skill,  and\r\n\r\nengage  students in greater breadth of learning to create\r\n\r\ngreater  diversity  and  to  open  new  pathways  in  the\r\n\r\nJC/Upper  Secondary education to cater to  the  different\r\n\r\nstrengths and interests of students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the arrival of the era of new knowledge-intensive economy, technology is advancing at a very fast\r\n\r\npace,  and  globalisation has created a lot of challenges\r\n\r\nfor  the  various economies. Singapore too  cannot  avoid\r\n\r\nfacing such challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the Workers' Party's 1994 Manifesto,\r\n\r\nour  educational perspective is that if  we  educate  our\r\n\r\npeople  so  that they have thinking skills and  cultivate\r\n\r\ntheir accounting and design capabilities, it would be  an\r\n\r\nimpetus  for our economic growth. We also feel  that  the\r\n\r\neducation  system  should allow for more  autonomy,  more\r\n\r\nparticipation  by the teachers and the parents,  so  that\r\n\r\nthere will be a more creative learning environment in our\r\n\r\nschools,  and  the  educational  content  could  be  more\r\n\r\ndiversified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general educational direction in this report and\r\n\r\nthe   motion   before  this  House  coincide   with   the\r\n\r\neducational   perspective   in   our   Workers'   Party's\r\n\r\nManifesto,  and is in keeping with the direction  of  the\r\n\r\ntime. I would, in principle, support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must ask, \"To whom is the educational\r\n\r\ndirection proposed by this Junior College/Upper Secondary\r\n\r\nEducation  Review  Report  targeted  at?  What  are   the\r\n\r\nobjectives?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for Education has mentioned, it is\r\n\r\ntargeted  at  the  students.   This  report  proposes   a\r\n\r\n\"through-train\" system built on the premise that the  top\r\n\r\n5%  students  in  the  PSLE examinations  would  have  no\r\n\r\nproblem  getting  through the \"A\" level examinations.  In\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwords,  this through-train system is meant for the  elite\r\n\r\nwho have obtained excellent results in the PSLE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not neglect the long-term impact brought\r\n\r\nabout by this secondary school through-train system. I am\r\n\r\nconcerned   with  the  following  problems.   First,   by\r\n\r\ndeciding the future of the students merely by their  PSLE\r\n\r\nresults will inevitably generate great pressures  on  the\r\n\r\nparents,  the  students  and  the  teachers.   Under  the\r\n\r\npresent circumstances where so much emphasis is placed on\r\n\r\nthe  scores, streaming and ranking, an additional  system\r\n\r\nwhereby  the PSLE results will decide whether the student\r\n\r\nwould  qualify for the best chance to be admitted to  the\r\n\r\nuniversity   will  certainly  intensify  the  competitive\r\n\r\npressure,  resulting in a vicious cycle.  As parents,  if\r\n\r\nyou  want  your  children to board this through-train  in\r\n\r\norder  to  travel farther ahead, you may  have  to  start\r\n\r\neducating them even when they are still in their mothers'\r\n\r\nwomb, otherwise they may not make it in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the reformed junior college curriculum\r\n\r\nwould  be even more demanding, as students will  have  to\r\n\r\nread  more  subjects.  Those who did not do well  in  the\r\n\r\nPSLE, and hence missed the through-train, would have only\r\n\r\ntwo  years  in a junior college to prepare  for  the  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevel examinations. Would they not be handicapped?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The through-train system enables the better students\r\n\r\nto  have ample time. They are exempted from the \"O\" level\r\n\r\nexaminations, and have a longer period of time  to  start\r\n\r\nearly   in   their   preparation  for   the   \"A\"   level\r\n\r\nexaminations.  On the other hand, those who  did  not  do\r\n\r\nwell in the PSLE will have just two years to  prepare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, this through-train system will broaden\r\n\r\nthe  students'  scope of learning and will inspire  their\r\n\r\ncreativity  and  cultivate  their  independent   thinking\r\n\r\nskills.  It also enables the colleges to be more flexible\r\n\r\nin  determining the pace of learning and the  arrangement\r\n\r\nof  subject  combinations.  However,  under  the  present\r\n\r\ncircumstances whereby so much importance is attached\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexamination  results, what assurance is  there  that  the\r\n\r\ncolleges,  the students, and the parents will not  demand\r\n\r\nand   make  use  of  this  opportunity  to  advance   the\r\n\r\npreparation   of   the  students  for   the   \"A\"   level\r\n\r\nexaminations, so that they will score even more As?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, if we set the examination papers based on\r\n\r\nthe  standard of the students in the through-train system\r\n\r\nand  their syllabus, then those who have missed the train\r\n\r\nwill  be at a distinct disadvantage.  Is it fair to them?\r\n\r\nAfter  all,  what  is the purpose of this  JC  curriculum\r\n\r\nreform?   Is  it meant to favour those students  who  did\r\n\r\nwell  in their PLSE so that they stand better chances  of\r\n\r\ngetting  into  the university, and to make it  even  more\r\n\r\ndifficult for those who did not do well in the PSLE?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, with the implementation of these\r\n\r\nrecommendations, Singapore will have a  new  category  of\r\n\r\nintegrated  high schools.  All these integrated  schools,\r\n\r\nwhich admit only qualified \"through-train\" students, will\r\n\r\nbecome  elite  schools.   Their  students  will  have  no\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  interact with students in  the  ordinary\r\n\r\nschools.  This will result in the disintegration  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, many of the likely through-train schools,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  ACS and Chinese High School are boys'  schools.\r\n\r\nWould this make it more difficult for the girls to get on\r\n\r\nboard the through-train?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, teaching resources. To attain the\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  the  through-train  system,  a   lot   of\r\n\r\nadjustments have to be made on the teaching methods.  Our\r\n\r\ncurrent  lot  of teachers were trained in the traditional\r\n\r\npedagogy.   How is MOE going to resolve this  problem  of\r\n\r\nteaching resources?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although I agree with the general\r\n\r\ndirection  of this motion, and I agree that the  through-train  system  will better develop the potential  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents,  I  think  the problems brought  about  by  the\r\n\r\nactual  implementation of this through-train system  will\r\n\r\nresult  in  more defects than merits. I think MOE  should\r\n\r\nconduct further studies on the solutions\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that  the  implementation of  these   recommendations\r\n\r\nwould attain the predestined goals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report has also recommended the establishment of\r\n\r\nspecialised independent schools to cater to students with\r\n\r\ntalents in specific fields, so that they could be trained\r\n\r\nto  fully develop their special abilities.  I agree  with\r\n\r\nthis  recommendation.  As for the setting up  of  private\r\n\r\nschools,  some  people feel that, apart  from  migration,\r\n\r\nthis  may be an avenue to get round the problem  of   the\r\n\r\nmother tongue requirement. Although I welcome the setting\r\n\r\nup  of  private schools to offer the parents more choices\r\n\r\nand   to   facilitate    the  formulation   of   creative\r\n\r\neducational  concepts, I must urge  MOE  to  compulsorily\r\n\r\nrequire all private schools to comply with the Ministry's\r\n\r\nbilingual  policy. Students in the private  schools  must\r\n\r\nalso  attain the minimum standard in their mother  tongue\r\n\r\nlanguage  before they can advance further. The Government\r\n\r\nmust  adhere  to  this  policy. Otherwise,  there  is  an\r\n\r\nabsolute possibility that the private schools will become\r\n\r\na  Pandora's box. The other problem likely to arise  with\r\n\r\nthe   independent schools is that they may  develop  into\r\n\r\naristocratic schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that if the Government recognises that the\r\n\r\npurpose  of education is to enable the people to  have  a\r\n\r\nbetter  understanding of the world they live in, so  that\r\n\r\nthey would be able to make wise decisions and live better\r\n\r\nlives,  then it should, first of all, change its attitude\r\n\r\nof  giving  high priority to the elite in  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem, and change the objective of using education as  a\r\n\r\nmeans to train and develop the human resources needed for\r\n\r\nthe new economy. The Government should look at the entire\r\n\r\neducation  system from a higher angle, to comprehensively\r\n\r\nraise  the educational quality of our people. The  entire\r\n\r\neducation package should be reviewed at a macro level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this reform is targeted at the junior\r\n\r\ncollege  and  higher secondary curriculum   so  that  our\r\n\r\nstudents will have more broad-based learning to deal with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  rapidly  changing times, with  a  recommendation  to\r\n\r\npromote cross-discipline curriculum structure, we  should\r\n\r\npay even more attention to the fact that providing cross-discipline  curriculum alone is not enough to  train  our\r\n\r\nstudents to possess better ability to achieve mastery  of\r\n\r\nthe  subjects.  We  need to have also a  big  environment\r\n\r\nconducive to this principle of learning, a batch of like-minded educationalists, and a brand-new set of assessment\r\n\r\ncriteria.    MOE should proceed to create  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nenvironment  so  that  this reform could  be  implemented\r\n\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think MOE should also consider conducting a review\r\n\r\non  the primary and secondary school curriculum as  well,\r\n\r\nso  that there will be continuity in our entire education\r\n\r\nsystem.  At the same time, it should also review  whether\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  need  to  carry on with  the  Primary  Four\r\n\r\nstreaming. I would also suggest that MOE study  into  the\r\n\r\npossibility of having a through-train from primary school\r\n\r\nto secondary school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the impact of the recommendations of this\r\n\r\nreport  on  the general student population  is  not  very\r\n\r\ngreat, as students who have missed the through-train  can\r\n\r\nstill  take the 'O' level, proceed to the junior  college\r\n\r\nor   upper  secondary,  and  then  take  the  'A'   level\r\n\r\nexaminations  after  two  or  three  years.    This   new\r\n\r\ncurriculum will be implemented only in 2006 to  give  MOE\r\n\r\nenough  time  to make the necessary preparation.  What  I\r\n\r\nemphasise is that, in any kind of reform, those  students\r\n\r\nwho  are  unable  to quickly adapt to  the  changes  will\r\n\r\ninevitably be affected. We should be sympathetic  towards\r\n\r\nthese students and offer them some buffering avenues,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  not  be sacrificed  in  this  necessary\r\n\r\neducational reform or be made guinea pigs under  the  new\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlike  the  other colleagues in this House, I support  the\r\n\r\nmotion in the name of the Minister for Education for  the\r\n\r\nreform  of  our education system.  I am a member  of  the\r\n\r\nReview Committee.  When I was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworking on the review and talking to the various parties,\r\n\r\nI  noticed  that  everyone  we  talked  to  -   from  the\r\n\r\nacademia,  private sector, entrepreneurs  themselves  and\r\n\r\nprofessionals  -  unanimously supported the idea that  we\r\n\r\nshould  reform and introduce new changes to our  JC/Upper\r\n\r\nSecondary  schools.  Everyone knows  that  the  world  is\r\n\r\nchanging, the economy is changing.  As a Chinese  proverb\r\n\r\nsaid, before a storm, there will be strong winds blowing.\r\n\r\nWe  all  feel the wind, and know we must prepare for  the\r\n\r\nrain.  We  must retool and rebuild. All these  will  take\r\n\r\ntime.  So we must plan and prepare early, and allow  time\r\n\r\nfor implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the professionals and the educationists, the\r\n\r\nteachers  and principals, the people stand  to  face  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  impact with the changes, are also  prepared  to\r\n\r\nface  the  changes,  albeit with some apprehension.  They\r\n\r\nunanimously  agree  that we must change,  and  change  we\r\n\r\nmust, whatever the difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am very glad to note that Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang too supports this motion, in principle.  I believe\r\n\r\nthis  motion  before  the House will  get  the  unanimous\r\n\r\nsupport  of Members.  The main consideration  is  on  its\r\n\r\nimplementation.  We must implement it well.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  has  given itself  4-5  years  to  do  the\r\n\r\nimportant  preparatory work, and will not  implement  the\r\n\r\nchanges  hastily. This is an admirable spirit.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nour  education system has been good and praised by  many.\r\n\r\nWe  are  only  talking about adjusting the JC  and  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary  school  system to face the  challenge  of  the\r\n\r\ntimes.   It is essential that the motion gets our  strong\r\n\r\nsupport, so that our professionals in MOE and the schools\r\n\r\nand   JCs   would   be   able  to  concentrate   on   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of these changes in the next 4 to 5 years,\r\n\r\nwithout having to look back.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To implement such changes, we will, of course, have\r\n\r\nto  take care of some concerns.  For example, will  there\r\n\r\nbe  too  much  emphasis on elitism?   Will  there  be  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  stress  on  our  students?   On  the  first\r\n\r\nquestion, I think the Minister of State Dr Ng Eng Hen has\r\n\r\nalready explained very clearly that in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npast  20-odd  years, under this education  system,  there\r\n\r\nwere  fewer  and  fewer  dropouts, reaching  almost  zero\r\n\r\nlevel.  If our education system is tinted towards looking\r\n\r\nafter  the elite, then there will not be such an outcome.\r\n\r\nSo  we  can  accept the assurance given by MOE  that  our\r\n\r\neducational  direction will not be focusing too  much  on\r\n\r\nthe  elitist.  Having taken care of the masses,  however,\r\n\r\nwe   should   also  give  our  strongest   students   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to give full play to their potential so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  become more creative, more innovative,  to  be\r\n\r\nable to compete better in the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is on stress and pressure. We\r\n\r\nmust  understand what stress is and who generates stress.\r\n\r\nI  feel that the so-called stress is not because you have\r\n\r\ntoo   much  work  to  do.  Too  much  workload  does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  lead  to  pressure.  For  some  people,  the\r\n\r\ngreater  the workload the happier they are.  If  you  ask\r\n\r\nthem  to  sit  down  and do nothing, that  would  be  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  stress. So more work does not necessarily  mean\r\n\r\ngreater  stress. Stress is a feeling of helplessness,  of\r\n\r\nnot knowing what to do. I hope that parents, like many of\r\n\r\nus,  must fully understand this point.  We must help  our\r\n\r\nchildren  to handle stress.  Is stress generated  because\r\n\r\nwe  have  too high expectations on them, and  hence  they\r\n\r\nfeel  helpless  and do not know what to do  as  they  are\r\n\r\nafraid of letting us down?  They cannot do what they want\r\n\r\nto  do, and they have to do what we want them to do.  Put\r\n\r\nourselves  in  their  shoes, and we  can  understand  the\r\n\r\nstress they face. So I hope that as parents, we should be\r\n\r\nrational in handling our expectations on our children  so\r\n\r\nas  not  to  put unreasonable stress on them.  Times  are\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  the past. When I was  young,  my  father\r\n\r\nasked me to study well, study properly.  He told me this,\r\n\r\n\"If you do not study properly you will end up working  as\r\n\r\na coolie.  As a coolie life is very, very tough.\"  During\r\n\r\nhis  time, in his village, there were probably  only  two\r\n\r\npersons who did not have to work in the paddy field.  One\r\n\r\nwas the village head and the other was the village school\r\n\r\nteacher.  Apart from these two, everyone else would  have\r\n\r\nto  work  in  the  paddy field.  So the choice  then  was\r\n\r\nbetween working in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  field and studying hard. Both are hard work, but  to\r\n\r\nmany the choice is quite obvious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have more choices than that now. If we cannot\r\n\r\njump  on  the  through-train, we  can  still  have  other\r\n\r\nregular channels of education through which you can go to\r\n\r\nthe  JC, and then the university.  Or, we can go overseas\r\n\r\nto  further  your  studies.   Many of  our  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues  here have mentioned examples of students  who\r\n\r\nleft  Singapore  to  study overseas, and  did  very  well\r\n\r\nbecause our good education system had prepared them well.\r\n\r\nSo  in  our  education system, all roads  lead  to  Rome.\r\n\r\nThere  are successful role models in every channels.  For\r\n\r\npolytechnic students, they have a model in Sim Wong  Hoo.\r\n\r\nHe   is  a polytechnic, and definitely an elite.  He  may\r\n\r\nnot  have  an university education, but his products  are\r\n\r\nwell  known  throughout the world.  Everybody  knows  the\r\n\r\nname \"Creative\".  Can you say that he is not an elite?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we must understand that in Singapore's education\r\n\r\nsystem, all roads lead to Rome.  If you want to become an\r\n\r\nelite  there  are many, many roads for you to  take.   So\r\n\r\nlong as you are prepared to work hard, try it out, you do\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily  need to go on the through-train.   Will\r\n\r\nour children who cannot go on the through-train be called\r\n\r\na  non-elite, and have to till the land, work  the  farm?\r\n\r\nThere  is no such thing.  There are other routes to take.\r\n\r\nThey  can still succeed by other routes.  So I hope  that\r\n\r\nparents  like  us  must be rational in  looking  at  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must understand that, with the proposed changes\r\n\r\nin  our  JC/Upper  Secondary  education  system,  MOE  is\r\n\r\nintroducing more channels, more routes for us  to  choose\r\n\r\nfrom.  Of course, if there are many choices, it may  also\r\n\r\nlead  to  some stress, because there can be a feeling  of\r\n\r\nhelplessness arising from not knowing which road to take.\r\n\r\nI  remember  when  I first went to the US,  I  wanted  to\r\n\r\ninstall  a  telephone-line. I was told that I have  three\r\n\r\nsets of numbers to choose from.  Back home, in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  1980s,  we  had no freedom to choose  the  telephone\r\n\r\nnumber  you wanted.   So, I felt a little stressed  then.\r\n\r\nSo  too many  choices could lead to stress, that is  when\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  know how to choose.  But in reality,  having\r\n\r\nmore  choices  is good. It is having no  choice  that  is\r\n\r\nreally  stressful. The many options open to the  children\r\n\r\nwill  give them opportunities to do even better for their\r\n\r\nfuture.   If  they are unable to go on the through-train,\r\n\r\nwe  should  not  force them.  They need  not  be  on  the\r\n\r\nthrough-train.  There are other ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JCs may want to have their own characteristics.\r\n\r\nThey  all try to be creative.  They want to emphasise  on\r\n\r\nculture,  the arts, etc. So they offer more  choices.  We\r\n\r\nmust  learn how to make choices, and we can benefit  from\r\n\r\nthe advantage of having many options. If you say I do not\r\n\r\ncare  how  many roads there are, I just want to take  one\r\n\r\nparticular road, then when you find that you cannot  make\r\n\r\nit,  you will be very stressed.  The stress can be  quite\r\n\r\nunbearable and it is a self-generated kind of stress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that through these changes which would bring\r\n\r\nabout   creativity   and  innovation,   Singapore   would\r\n\r\ngradually  evolve  into  a really gracious  metropolitan,\r\n\r\nwhere all the flowers bloom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now a population of 3 million. If tomorrow,\r\n\r\nSingapore suddenly disappears, what would the world  have\r\n\r\nmissed?  Perhaps Singapore Airlines, and perhaps Creative\r\n\r\nTechnology.   That  is  about all.   I  cannot  think  of\r\n\r\nanything else which the world would feel have lost.  But,\r\n\r\nif  tomorrow, Scotland disappears, what would  the  world\r\n\r\nmiss? Scotland has a population of about 5 million,  less\r\n\r\nthan  twice of ours.  They would miss the game  of  golf,\r\n\r\nthe  biscuit  called  shortbread, the  unique  kilts  and\r\n\r\nbagpipers, it's the song of Auld Lang Syne, and the drink\r\n\r\nof  whiskey.   So there are many things which  the  world\r\n\r\nwould miss if Scotland were to disappear.  And these  are\r\n\r\nthe  products of their culture and marketing  skills.  We\r\n\r\nhave not reached that level of culture.  But through  our\r\n\r\ncontinuous efforts to go up, to diversify, to be flexible\r\n\r\nin  all other fields of arts and culture, I think one day\r\n\r\nwe will also reach\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  stage  that despite our small 3 million  population,\r\n\r\nwe  contribute  to  the  world in  such  a  way  that  if\r\n\r\nSingapore   should  disappear,  the  world   would   miss\r\n\r\nsomething important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that of late, the morale of our people is\r\n\r\ngenerally not very high. We worry about retrenchment,  we\r\n\r\nare  concerned  with  unemployment.

I would like to  tell  him\r\n\r\nthat  it  is always easier said that done.  He said  that\r\n\r\nthose  who cannot go on the through-train can go overseas\r\n\r\nfor  their  studies.  This is not easy.  To go  overseas,\r\n\r\nyou need money, lots of money.  If you have no money, you\r\n\r\ncannot  even  cross a river, how do you go overseas.

He also mentioned that with\r\n\r\ntoo  many  options,  he  was troubled  and  it  became  a\r\n\r\npressure to him.

When  I  was  working   on   the\r\n\r\nSingapore 21 project, I had the opportunity to  speak  to\r\n\r\nmany  young  people.   I  observed that  the  polytechnic\r\n\r\ngraduates    were    very    aggressive.     They    were\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial,  strong in their spirit,  even  stronger\r\n\r\nthan  the  University graduates.  I  asked  some  of  the\r\n\r\npolytechnic graduates why this was so.  They told me that\r\n\r\nthey had two options after their graduation.  One was  to\r\n\r\nfight  it  out like Sim Wong Hoo who was their  idol  and\r\n\r\nrole model.  The other option was to be contented with  a\r\n\r\n$3,000-$4,000 salary job and live in a 5-room flat.   So,\r\n\r\nif  you want to strike it big, you fight for it.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang will not  look  down  on  the\r\n\r\npolytechnic  graduates.  As for the  so-called  pressure,\r\n\r\nlet me tell him a story.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encouraged my son to take up a third language, the\r\n\r\nMalay language. When he was in Secondary 3, he said  that\r\n\r\nit  was  too much pressure for him and he wanted to  drop\r\n\r\nit.   I asked him why.  He said that the teacher was  not\r\n\r\ngood, and that it was likely that he would fail his  oral\r\n\r\nexamination.   I  told  him not to  worry,  and  that  by\r\n\r\nacquiring  one additional language he would have  another\r\n\r\npassport, one more path to take.  I told him that it  was\r\n\r\nnot necessary to strive for an A1, just manage a pass,  a\r\n\r\nC6  would do.  Maybe it is a smaller passport but  it  is\r\n\r\none  extra passport.  He said, \"Let me try.\"  In the end,\r\n\r\nhe  succeeded.   So  one extra path, a  little  bit  more\r\n\r\npressure, but it is worth it!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I clarify\r\n\r\nbecause  the Minister of State has misunderstood  what  I\r\n\r\nsaid?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): I would like to clarify that I am\r\n\r\nnot  looking  down  at  the  polytechnic  graduates.    I\r\n\r\nactually respect our polytechnic graduates.  They may  be\r\n\r\nour enterpreneurs in future.  What I am saying is that in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of Sim Wong Hoo, did Singapore really  provide\r\n\r\nopportunities   for   development  of   the   polytechnic\r\n\r\ngraduates\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the past?

This is something which  is  a\r\n\r\nlong term endeavour.

The  global\r\n\r\neconomy  today  is  heavily  driven  by  technology   and\r\n\r\ninnovation - which has revolutionised the way  we  learn,\r\n\r\nthe  way we live and the way we think.  These innovations\r\n\r\nwill  continue to change our lifestyles as well as life's\r\n\r\ndemands.   The  future ahead is both uncertain,  and  yet\r\n\r\nfilled with opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, education must, in short, prepare our\r\n\r\nyoung to face the future.  In fact, it should aim to give\r\n\r\nour   future  generation  a  competitive  edge   in   the\r\n\r\nincreasingly integrated world.  This is possible with not\r\n\r\njust  economic relevance or consciousness, but  also  the\r\n\r\nvirtue  of a good value system and community spiritedness\r\n\r\nbuilt into the programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education must help students to become more\r\n\r\nefficient and effective, be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nable  to  think creatively and critically, so  that  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  given  a  series of  choices,  they  can  make\r\n\r\ncritical  decisions and make the choices, and  equip  our\r\n\r\nyounger  generation with lifelong skills.  As demands  on\r\n\r\nspecific  skills  and job types change  at  unprecedented\r\n\r\nrates,  it  will  no longer be sufficient  to  train  our\r\n\r\nyouths in specific skill sets that are narrowly defined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I am heartened to know that the proposed\r\n\r\nchanges aim at a broad-based education which includes the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  subjects  like  Knowledge  and  Inquiry\r\n\r\nskills.   I am also heartened to know that a more diverse\r\n\r\nlandscape  with  at  least  three  new  routes  will   be\r\n\r\nintroduced.   I  am, however, not so heartened  to  learn\r\n\r\nthat  the  three new routes as well as the Knowledge  and\r\n\r\nInquiry skills will only be made available to the regular\r\n\r\ngroup  of  creme  de la creme.  If it is  good,  why  not\r\n\r\nengineer it into the mainstream education?  Why  stop  at\r\n\r\nthe  top  10% for the Integrated Programme Schools  which\r\n\r\nmay also benefit the not so examination-savvy type?  Does\r\n\r\nthis  imply  that the proposed changes will only  benefit\r\n\r\nthose who qualify for JC, ie, 25% of each cohort, and the\r\n\r\n10%  that  qualify for the Integrated Programme  Schools?\r\n\r\nIf  so,  then there is really no significant overhaul  in\r\n\r\nthe  curricula  for  the majority of students  undergoing\r\n\r\nsecondary  education.  In other words,  despite  all  the\r\n\r\ngood  intentions  of the changes, the  majority  of  each\r\n\r\ncohort  will  still  be 'stuck' in the current  education\r\n\r\nsystem  which may not prepare them sufficiently  for  the\r\n\r\nnew challenges ahead.  It will be difficult to battle new\r\n\r\ngrounds with old weapons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope MOE would perhaps run that 10% as a pilot\r\n\r\nscheme with the intention of incorporating the Integrated\r\n\r\nProgramme School system into the mainstream structure, if\r\n\r\nfound to be suitable.  I also hope that, for a start, the\r\n\r\nschools elected in the IP School system would comprise  a\r\n\r\ngood  mix  of  schools  from  both  the  elites  and  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood schools.  I think the demonstration  effect\r\n\r\nof such a scheme would be far reaching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since many of my colleagues in this House have\r\n\r\nspoken extensively on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossible   social   effects  of  the  proposed   changes,\r\n\r\nespecially  on the topic of adding more stress  into  the\r\n\r\ncurrent system and even possible elitism, I shall refrain\r\n\r\nfrom repeating the arguments here.  I will, however,  add\r\n\r\nthat  any  attempt at creating a level playing  field  or\r\n\r\ncreating  a totally egalitarian society may be an  uphill\r\n\r\ntask, as each individual is differently gifted.  Hence, a\r\n\r\ngood  education system must aim to bring out the best  in\r\n\r\nthe  individual,  and  allow room  for  them  to  blossom\r\n\r\naccording  to their gifts.  The focus should then  be  on\r\n\r\nwhether  the  proposed  changes  retard  or  improve   an\r\n\r\nindividual's potential to be the best that he/she can be.\r\n\r\nMy  sense is, on paper, the proposed changes will improve\r\n\r\nthe   current   system,  provided  more  flexibility   is\r\n\r\nexercised in the implementation.  The devil, I am afraid,\r\n\r\nmay lie in the implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crux would be whether we are ready for these\r\n\r\nchanges.   To quote William Shakespeare, \"All things  are\r\n\r\nready,  if  our minds be so.\"  The proposed  changes  are\r\n\r\nsignificant  and  constitute  a  paradigm  shift  in  the\r\n\r\nestablished education system.  However, for any change to\r\n\r\ntake  place, there must be a certain amount of belief  in\r\n\r\nthe  changes and a momentum that is built up.  The  speed\r\n\r\nof  change  is  directly correlated to  the  momentum  of\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corollary, the better convinced and prepared the\r\n\r\nvarious  players  in  this equation are,  and  that  will\r\n\r\ninclude the principals, teachers, MOE personnel, parents,\r\n\r\nstudents  and the society at large, then the  faster  and\r\n\r\nhigher the chances of success would be.  As such, I would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Minister to comment on the  current  state  of\r\n\r\nreadiness  of  these  various  players,  especially   the\r\n\r\nprincipals,  teachers, and even MOE  personnel  and  also\r\n\r\nwhether the parents and students have been told about the\r\n\r\nchanges and explained to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher readiness is pivotal to the success of the\r\n\r\nproposed changes.  In the new economy, the teachers' role\r\n\r\nhas shifted from that of a content provider to that of  a\r\n\r\nfacilitator.  Today, with easy access to the Internet and\r\n\r\nother  media, there is information overload even  at  the\r\n\r\nschool level.  Therefore, a teacher plays a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvital  role  in  helping students direct and  manage  the\r\n\r\ncontent  available on the Internet and other  media.   As\r\n\r\naptly  put  by  a  John  Naisbitt, \"We  are  drowning  in\r\n\r\ninformation but starved for knowledge\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important, a teacher should be able to\r\n\r\ngroom,  inspire and spot talent and further help  develop\r\n\r\nand  guide  these  talented students  to  maximise  their\r\n\r\npotential.  It has been said that it is harder  to  teach\r\n\r\nold  dogs  new tricks.  So while the students  may  adapt\r\n\r\nfaster to the changes, the teachers may find it difficult\r\n\r\nto  acquire some new teaching techniques and habits,  let\r\n\r\nalone  exercise them.  Hence, I would like MOE to comment\r\n\r\non  what  measures are in the pipeline to  help  teachers\r\n\r\nplug  into this new system and whether MOE would consider\r\n\r\nthe  'external  consultant' approach to  jump  start  the\r\n\r\nshift in thinking and habits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to move my focus to an area which\r\n\r\nis  somewhat  less  talked about, that  is,  of  a  value\r\n\r\nsystem.   Education which stops short  at  economics  and\r\n\r\nefficiency  may  prove  to  be  the  greatest  menace  of\r\n\r\nsociety.  In the words of Martin Luther King Junior, \"the\r\n\r\nmost dangerous criminal may be the men gifted with reason\r\n\r\nbut with no morals\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us learn some lessons from the United States.\r\n\r\nThe  recent scandals in the corporate America are lessons\r\n\r\nin  which our education system can draw upon.  As  highly\r\n\r\nintelligent  men conspire to cheat, there can  be  severe\r\n\r\nrepercussions on the whole capitalist system in which the\r\n\r\nglobal  economy  operates.  We saw how  Arthur  Anderson,\r\n\r\nEnron,  WorldCom,  amongst the others,  fell  from  grace\r\n\r\nglobally  within a few months, wiping some US$5  trillion\r\n\r\nin  market value.  This cost is equivalent to an  average\r\n\r\nof US$60,000, or S$106,200, in losses.  These huge losses\r\n\r\nare caused only by a handful of people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, apart from good institutions and laws in our\r\n\r\ncountry,  we  need most of all good people.  People  with\r\n\r\ngood  values and ethics, people with integrity.  As  part\r\n\r\nof  the  total education, our education system should  be\r\n\r\nbroad-based enough to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nencompass these teachings.  The report, I feel, does  not\r\n\r\nsufficiently address how it will focus on such  teachings\r\n\r\nor  even include this value system consideration into the\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ERC, not the Economic Restructuring\r\n\r\nCommittee,  but the Education Review Committee,  gathered\r\n\r\ninsights  from top schools in the UK, US, Hong  Kong  and\r\n\r\nChina, it would also be useful to note that, in Thailand,\r\n\r\na  ministerial committee is developing a system to record\r\n\r\nthe  \"goodness\"  of high school students.   Colleges  and\r\n\r\nuniversities country-wide will take the goodness  records\r\n\r\ninto  account  when deciding whom to  admit.   They  have\r\n\r\nrealised  that to admit students with high  morals  would\r\n\r\nalso be one way of eradicating corruption in the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we do not face serious corruption problems\r\n\r\nin   our  country,  this  system  nonetheless  encourages\r\n\r\nstudents to be good and maintain moral integrity.   I  am\r\n\r\nnot suggesting that we adopt exactly the same system.   I\r\n\r\nam saying that these are important components.  We, in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial Singapore, have shared and common values and\r\n\r\nif  we  can  inculcate  some of  these  values  into  the\r\n\r\neducation  system,  we can then benefit  our  society  at\r\n\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education on our shared values can also do greater\r\n\r\ngood  in  highlighting common traits amongst us, although\r\n\r\nbeing  people of diverse cultures and religions, to  come\r\n\r\ntogether  as  one  people, one nation and  one  Singapore\r\n\r\ncaring  for each other, crossing all boundaries.  This  I\r\n\r\nfeel  should be part of the total education in  which  we\r\n\r\nimpart to our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education system in the country can also play a\r\n\r\nrole  in nation building by inculcating a sense of  civic\r\n\r\nconsciousness,  ie, a sense of community  and  rootedness\r\n\r\nand  promote  the  spirit  of active  citizenry  with  an\r\n\r\nobjective of bringing about a gracious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools can play an important role in building a\r\n\r\ngracious community and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromoting  active citizenry through active  participation\r\n\r\nand  engagement in community activities.  Currently, most\r\n\r\nlinks  between the schools and the community are at  best\r\n\r\nloose  and ad hoc.  There is more that can be  done.   We\r\n\r\nshould  devise  ways, schemes to engage and  tap  on  the\r\n\r\nenergy  of  students and expose them in a more meaningful\r\n\r\nfashion   through  the  community.   Instead  of  one-off\r\n\r\nprojects  with \"term\" engagement, we should prolong  this\r\n\r\n\"engagement  process\" which can continuously  take  place\r\n\r\nfrom primary school to university, thereby cultivating  a\r\n\r\nlifelong  relationship  between  the  community  and  the\r\n\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some suggestions here:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Schools can work with grassroots organisations\r\n\r\n(GROs)  to  contribute and improve the  neighbourhood  or\r\n\r\ncommunity that they are situated in.  The objective is to\r\n\r\nget  the  students integrated into the GRO.  One possible\r\n\r\nexample would be to link the NPCC or NCC to the CDEC,  so\r\n\r\nthat  students get real world experience in their  weekly\r\n\r\ndrills  and simultaneously learn more about the community\r\n\r\nthat  they  live in or serve.  This process of engagement\r\n\r\nbetween  community  could  be  built  into  the  school's\r\n\r\ncurriculum on \"Life Skills\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) They could link project works directly to\r\n\r\ncommunity - research work.  For example, students can  be\r\n\r\nasked to research on how the community operates, ie,  the\r\n\r\nfunctions, the impact and the importance of each organism\r\n\r\nin the community eco-system.  This could include the role\r\n\r\nof    community   centres,   town   councils,    business\r\n\r\norganisations, VWOs, and so on, and so forth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project works can further incorporate hands-on\r\n\r\nparticipation  where, in such activities, students  would\r\n\r\nbe  given the experience and exposure to work with  these\r\n\r\nvarious  organisms.  This way, they would also learn  the\r\n\r\nskills  of  communication beyond that of their peers  and\r\n\r\ntheir  school environment.  They would have what we  call\r\n\r\nexperiential learning built into the school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) They could also learn and suggest solutions to\r\n\r\ncurrent real-life challenges\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat are faced by the community.  Student task forces can\r\n\r\nbe  formed to tackle the common issues on transportation,\r\n\r\nenvironmental problems, crime prevention, or even finding\r\n\r\nways  and  means to help the needy within the  community.\r\n\r\nThey can then present their findings, either in a written\r\n\r\nor  oral  presentation, and such presentations should  be\r\n\r\nlooked  at  seriously  and  given  a  certain  amount  of\r\n\r\nweightage.   In  other words, they  should  not  be  seen\r\n\r\npurely  as  ECA  that is not relevant  to  their  overall\r\n\r\nacademic performance.  It should, however, not add stress\r\n\r\nto the system by giving them an examination at the end of\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are able to incorporate some of these schemes,\r\n\r\nI  believe that most students will then be able to  learn\r\n\r\nto  think  out  of  the  box,  to  think  creatively  and\r\n\r\ncritically,  because  when they are  doing  syllabus  and\r\n\r\nsubject matters that are close to their heart where  they\r\n\r\nare  living  in  or in the community that they  live  in,\r\n\r\nchances  are  it  would help them to  identify  with  the\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people become interested in the events and\r\n\r\nhappenings  in the community and society, and where  they\r\n\r\nhave made efforts to improve the community they live  in,\r\n\r\nin  the  long run, we will be able to build  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging,  of rootedness and we will have  a  population\r\n\r\nthat  is not being accused of being bo-chap, which  means\r\n\r\nthey do not care.  Perhaps we will have citizens who will\r\n\r\nalways care for the community that they live in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would be the kind of heartstrings that we want\r\n\r\nto  form, that will tie us to our friends, neighbours and\r\n\r\nthe  community  that we belong to.   These  will  be  the\r\n\r\nstayers who will have a bond with Singapore wherever they\r\n\r\nmay  be  in  this world.  For many years,  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem  and our society have focused on building economic\r\n\r\nstrings,  job  strings and asset strings.   We  must  now\r\n\r\nrealise  that  in  this age and time of a  highly  mobile\r\n\r\npopulation,  where our citizens possess the language  and\r\n\r\nthe  passport  to the world, it is only the  heartstrings\r\n\r\nthat  will continue to bond us to Singapore and  make  us\r\n\r\nfeel like sons and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat  better  place  to  start than  with  the  education\r\n\r\nsystem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the changes recommended will\r\n\r\nprepare  students as leaders, innovators and citizens  of\r\n\r\ntomorrow.  For it to work well, all the partners  in  the\r\n\r\neducation system must come together and work together  to\r\n\r\nprovide  our students with this total education  to  help\r\n\r\nthem to attain not just academic excellence but also life-long skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the greatest impact that these changes\r\n\r\nwill have will be on our young and on Singapore's future.\r\n\r\nAs such, I think it would be good for us to know who they\r\n\r\nare, what they are like and how they think, to gauge  the\r\n\r\nsuitability of the proposed changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be useful to note from none other than the\r\n\r\nman  in  touch with youth culture, the President  of  MTV\r\n\r\nAsia,  Mr  Frank  Brown.   He refers  to  today's  young,\r\n\r\ntoday's 3G, as the \"Dual Passport Generation\".  He  notes\r\n\r\nthat  Asia's 3G these days value their individuality  and\r\n\r\nare   completely  comfortable  with  modern   consumerist\r\n\r\nexperience.  He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They can multi-task - watch more TV, do more on the\r\n\r\ncomputer and read more magazines - all at the same  time.\r\n\r\nThey can be both local and cosmopolitan simultaneously  - there is no identity crisis.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, he goes further to disagree with\r\n\r\nHarvard   don  Robert  Putnam's  term  \"blowing   alone\",\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the  3G  as people who  prefer  to  remain\r\n\r\npassively  disengaged, rather than join any  clubs  of  a\r\n\r\ngrassroots,  commercial,  industrial,  moral  or  serious\r\n\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people today, says Frank Brown, are more\r\n\r\nactive  than any previous generation in terms  of  social\r\n\r\ncommunication   and   community.    If   Frank    Brown's\r\n\r\nobservations are correct, then the proposed changes which\r\n\r\nwe  seek  to implement, which encourage a diverse  broad-based  education,  and  if we can  incorporate  community\r\n\r\nspiritedness value system into the system, then  I  think\r\n\r\nit  will be suitable for the type of people whom we  seek\r\n\r\nto provide this education to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us then, as Members of this House and leaders of\r\n\r\ntoday,  capitalise  on this spirit and  vibrancy  of  our\r\n\r\nyouth  in designing for our students an education  system\r\n\r\nthat  will equip them with a blend of academic  and  non-academic  skills  coupled with  moral  values  and  civic\r\n\r\nconsciousness,  thereby  making  them  good  leaders  and\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  tomorrow.   Only then  can  we  ensure  the\r\n\r\nsurvival of our country, our nation, our Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to speak  on\r\n\r\nthis  motion.  I wish to speak in support of this  motion\r\n\r\nstanding in the name of the Minister for Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no quarrel with the intention of the Report\r\n\r\nto  develop  thinking and communication  skills  for  our\r\n\r\nstudents in upper secondary and junior colleges, as  well\r\n\r\nas  to  provide a wider range of subjects  and  areas  of\r\n\r\nlearning  for our students.  The diversity we require  in\r\n\r\nknowledge and thinking processes cannot be doubted.   The\r\n\r\nmark  of  our Ministry of Education's mandate as well  as\r\n\r\nthe slogan of \"Thinking Schools and Learning Nation\",  as\r\n\r\nfirst  articulated in 1997, can be said to be  milestones\r\n\r\nin the development of our education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report essentially proposes a wider gradation of\r\n\r\nthe  education system to give depth and width to a larger\r\n\r\ngroup of our students.  There will be new subjects at  H3\r\n\r\nlevel, and new subjects of learning for the new system of\r\n\r\nexaminations.  This is good.  After all, any  old  system\r\n\r\nof  examination developed decades ago, having  served  us\r\n\r\nwell, should give way to newer ones, more suitable,  more\r\n\r\nrelevant  to the time.  The world after all is not  quite\r\n\r\nthe same, and knowledge has exploded in this period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the Report, we are introduced to new\r\n\r\nareas  of  enquiry,  communication skills,  language  and\r\n\r\nknowledge\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nskills, humanities and the Arts, mathematics and science.\r\n\r\nAn Integrated Programme Structure of six years through to\r\n\r\ncomplete  pre-university  will replace  the  present  4-2\r\n\r\nsystem.   How  can we quarrel with learning more  things,\r\n\r\nlearning  deeper  about  things, talking  and  discussing\r\n\r\nabout  them  in an intelligent way?  How can  we  dispute\r\n\r\nabout the importance of greater diversity in learning for\r\n\r\nour students?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A famous philosopher - I think it was Wittgenstein - once said: \"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one does\r\n\r\nnot  know.\"  I wonder whether the fact that our  students\r\n\r\nare  found  to  be poor in expressing their  thoughts  is\r\n\r\nreally  due  to  their  language  difficulties,  ie,  the\r\n\r\ncomplexity   of  learning  languages  in  Singapore,   as\r\n\r\nmentioned in the Report, or is it because they  have  not\r\n\r\nquite  really learnt the subject properly.  Is it because\r\n\r\nthe  way our subjects are currently being taught and  the\r\n\r\nway  we assess them that do not give them much chance for\r\n\r\ndiscussion  and expression in order for them  to  clarify\r\n\r\ntheir  thoughts?  In ancient Greek culture, the  learning\r\n\r\nprocess  centres  on  dialogue.   One  has  to  refer  to\r\n\r\nSocrates  and Plato.  I suspect teaching in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nmore  monologue than anything.  This new system  proposes\r\n\r\nto make changes to the current system to give more skills\r\n\r\nat  learning or on knowledge acquisition.  I welcome  the\r\n\r\nproposal, but I hope we will do it right.  It is quite  a\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can cram our students with content, but what are\r\n\r\nthey   going  to  do  with  these  contents?   Have  they\r\n\r\nunderstood the facts and how the facts stand in relation,\r\n\r\nin  order  to  adequately express what they  think  about\r\n\r\nthose  facts and the contents they learn?  Do  they  know\r\n\r\nwhat  they  are talking about?  And if they do not  talk,\r\n\r\nmaybe  they  do  not know.  When will  the  magic  moment\r\n\r\nstrike  in  thinking when the facts are resolved  into  a\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  pattern  that can  be  expressed  to  be\r\n\r\nsomething meaningful to the persons listening to you?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning more about content, while good, cannot lead\r\n\r\nto  the  act  of creation in engendering  a  new  way  of\r\n\r\nlooking at the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncausal  relationship  or  the pattern  of  occurrence  of\r\n\r\nevents.   This capacity for creative imagination  springs\r\n\r\nnot  just from the analytical process of the human  mind.\r\n\r\nIt  has to do with perception as much as conception.   It\r\n\r\nhas  to do with what the mind can see than what the  mind\r\n\r\ncan think.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning about facts alone will not necessarily\r\n\r\nprepare our kids for the future.  It is the way we relate\r\n\r\nthe  facts  and  the content that will determine  whether\r\n\r\nthese  facts  are going to be meaningful to the  students\r\n\r\nlearning about them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creative thinking is important. New ways of looking\r\n\r\nat  things  or  even  inducing  facts  from  observation,\r\n\r\nhypothesising anew and challenging sacred cows require  a\r\n\r\nnew frame of mind.  It is important to teach our children\r\n\r\nto  be  creative, to give them room for creative thinking\r\n\r\nand  imagination.   Project  work  can  be  a  basis  for\r\n\r\nallowing creative imagination, but it depends on  how  we\r\n\r\nconduct  the project.  Time must be given to explore  and\r\n\r\nchallenge  the  usual frame of reference of  our  current\r\n\r\nthoughts.  To do this requires a new frame of mind.   The\r\n\r\nschool  children  should be given  not  the  syllabus  as\r\n\r\nimportant as the environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, it is not by saying that we\r\n\r\nallow  for  wider  and deeper subject learning  that  the\r\n\r\ncreative impulse will come.  There must be time and space\r\n\r\nallowed for the students' imagination to fallow, incubate\r\n\r\nand  envision.   It  depends  on  the  way  we  teach  or\r\n\r\ncommunicate the wonderment of the subject.  It depends on\r\n\r\nhow we test or evaluate them.  We must give them time  to\r\n\r\nexplore  and express.  Perhaps the way we evaluate  their\r\n\r\ncompetence ought to be varied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the new facts or content we learn or know\r\n\r\nthat  will determine whether they are of any use.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe way we interpret or relate these facts that will lead\r\n\r\nto  a  new discovery, new process, new product or  a  new\r\n\r\nsolution to an age-old problem.  Hence, the new programme\r\n\r\nstructure, while commendable, is only half the story.  It\r\n\r\nis  in the things and the ways we teach that will be more\r\n\r\ncritical.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncurriculum we develop for this structure and the  way  we\r\n\r\nteach  and  evaluate  them  are  equally,  if  not  more,\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I mean? When we study a subject in school\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, I dare say we often do not bother or  know\r\n\r\nabout  the history of a subject - whether it is a science\r\n\r\nsubject,  the  history  of some scientific  theory  on  a\r\n\r\nsubject, or the history of economic thought or theories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are interested to learn the current vocabulary\r\n\r\nand not bother about the background of how these theories\r\n\r\nor  concepts  came about.  Yet, understanding  how  these\r\n\r\ncurrent  ideas came about is most important, to know  the\r\n\r\nunderlying  assumptions,  the beliefs,  the  biases,  the\r\n\r\nprejudices sometimes behind many of our ideas.  The great\r\n\r\neconomist  Keynes once said, \"We are often the slaves  to\r\n\r\nthe ideas of some defunct economists.\"  Great discoveries\r\n\r\nare  often  made  by  challenging  assumptions,  and  the\r\n\r\nassumptions lie embedded like fossils in the  old  stone.\r\n\r\nUnless  we know the history of the subject or the history\r\n\r\nof  the theory, we may well be heading the wrong path, or\r\n\r\nnot aware of why we think the way we are thinking.  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned about this as I see limitations in our  current\r\n\r\ncurriculum development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To properly cater to the diversity of strength and\r\n\r\ninterest of our students, we must give them the space  to\r\n\r\nlearn  and share.  It means more time to cover and  dwell\r\n\r\non  the  subject,  more time to explore and  discuss,  to\r\n\r\nthink  around the topic.  As long as the system tries  to\r\n\r\njam too many things, the time and space available will be\r\n\r\nconstrained, and defeats the whole purpose of what it may\r\n\r\nbe hoping to achieve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will always be the bright students who will\r\n\r\nmanage  to  score best in the test or the key performance\r\n\r\nindices, but the output may not be the ones we should  be\r\n\r\nlooking  for, if addressing the challenges of the  future\r\n\r\nin education is what we are trying to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average pre-university student today will, in\r\n\r\nall probability, know more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfacts about the world or the solar system than Galileo in\r\n\r\nhis  time.  But we would be kidding ourselves if we think\r\n\r\nthey are all little Galileos, because the creative genius\r\n\r\nis  not  about knowing facts and mastering content alone,\r\n\r\nbut new ways of imaginatively thinking about them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I would like to support this motion.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for allowing me to participate in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said on the motion before the House\r\n\r\nsince yesterday.  The fact that 33 Members have indicated\r\n\r\ninterest in speaking on the motion speaks volumes of  the\r\n\r\nimportance of the topic.  Education policies have been in\r\n\r\nthe hearts and minds of many Singaporeans.  Yesterday, we\r\n\r\nheard eloquent speeches from Members, some defending  the\r\n\r\neducation  system,  others presenting  their  well-argued\r\n\r\ncriticisms of some parts of the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed education is so dear to all our hearts.\r\n\r\nThe  changes proposed have far reaching implications  for\r\n\r\nour  children.   True to the intent it  was  set  out  to\r\n\r\nserve,  the  operative words in the proposed changes  are\r\n\r\nflexibility,   diversity,   creativity   -    ingredients\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  survive in a new innovation-driven  global\r\n\r\neconomy.  Indeed, each talent needs to be enhanced.   The\r\n\r\nproposed  changes  seek  to  prepare  and  develop  these\r\n\r\ndiverse  talents  through  paths  that  best  suit   each\r\n\r\nindividual's abilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a lecturer at the university, I find the\r\n\r\nproposed  changes to the JC curriculum indeed  very  long\r\n\r\noverdue.  I guess the frustration faced by teachers  like\r\n\r\nmyself is epitomised by the offer made by NUS to run  its\r\n\r\nown  secondary school to overcome the problem of students\r\n\r\ncoming  to NUS expecting to be spoon-fed. Till  today,  I\r\n\r\nstill  have  difficulty getting students to open  up  and\r\n\r\npresent their own\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nideas.  Many are still tongue-tied, expecting me to  give\r\n\r\nthem  the  \"answers\" to the discussion topics.   If  ever\r\n\r\nthey  spoke,  many will be guarded, often trying  to  say\r\n\r\nwhat I want to hear rather than what they actually think.\r\n\r\nAre  they thinking individuals?  Well, some are, but most\r\n\r\nare   not  thinking  of  their  response  to  the  topics\r\n\r\ndiscussed, but rather thinking of what the teacher  wants\r\n\r\nto hear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a gross lack of self-confidence in many of\r\n\r\nthem.   I  am  not  sure  how the proposed  changes  will\r\n\r\naddress  this lack of confidence among the students  that\r\n\r\ncome  to  the university.  They are the products  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  JC system.  Yes, there will be the few who  will\r\n\r\ndisplay  confidence naturally.  But, by and  large,  many\r\n\r\nthat we see do not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes are touted to produce students\r\n\r\nwho  have  better  thinking and  other  knowledge  skills\r\n\r\nincluding  communication skills.  The recent  changes  in\r\n\r\nthe  way  the  \"A\" level examinations are being  designed\r\n\r\ntest   students'  thinking  skills  where  students   are\r\n\r\nencouraged to offer personal views and bring higher-order\r\n\r\nskills  of  analysis, synthesis and knowledge application\r\n\r\nto  their  reading and writing.  All these are  well  and\r\n\r\ngood.    But  I  wonder  what  aspect  of  the   proposed\r\n\r\ncurriculum  changes will develop the  confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nstudents  to  express  their  own  independent  thoughts,\r\n\r\nindependent of what they think the teachers are thinking.\r\n\r\nThese  students must be taught to question the  question.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  these  skills  are not  taught  but  rather  are\r\n\r\noutcomes  from  processes that recognise individuals  for\r\n\r\nwho  they are and for their own abilities.  It goes  back\r\n\r\nto  the  values  that are transmitted within  the  system\r\n\r\nitself,  to what extent do we value individual  opinions,\r\n\r\nno  matter  how insignificant they may be.  Our  students\r\n\r\nare afraid to speak out because they are afraid that what\r\n\r\nthey  will  say  may be wrong or they may be  saying  the\r\n\r\nwrong  thing.  In the complex new world, right  or  wrong\r\n\r\nare  in  themselves complex concepts.  One's opinion  may\r\n\r\nlead  to  the  right decision today but  wrong  tomorrow.\r\n\r\nSuccessful  entrepreneurs make many wrong  decisions  and\r\n\r\nfail before they succeed.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoint  is:  do  we dare to speak up, make a  mistake  and\r\n\r\nlearn  from  the mistake?  These are important  processes\r\n\r\nthat must be part of the new system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is critical is the extent to which we develop\r\n\r\nthis culture of valuing individual ideas and opinions  in\r\n\r\nand of themselves.  We should not value the ideas because\r\n\r\nthe  ideas  bring economic value.  We should  value  them\r\n\r\nbecause  they come from an individual who is  willing  to\r\n\r\nshare  his thoughts. We value them because we value  each\r\n\r\nindividual.  Such  processes  will  go  a  long  way   in\r\n\r\ndeveloping self-esteem and confidence of our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, pedagogically, it is a new way of looking at\r\n\r\neducation.   Education is more than just the transmission\r\n\r\nof  knowledge,  often  assessed through  the  outcome  of\r\n\r\nexaminations.  Education is about processes.   We  should\r\n\r\nindeed pay equal attention to the processes as we do  the\r\n\r\noutcomes.   We  should be conscious of the processes  for\r\n\r\nthe  best  learning is often done through processing  the\r\n\r\nprocesses.   Assessment should thus not merely  focus  on\r\n\r\nthe  outcomes but the processes that students go  through\r\n\r\nin  their  learning. Sir, I urge MOE to pay attention  to\r\n\r\nthis  aspect  of education as it implements the  proposed\r\n\r\nchanges  to  the  JC curriculum, including  training  the\r\n\r\nteachers with new teaching methods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the recommendations of the Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  which  calls for greater  flexibility  in  the\r\n\r\nsubject combinations that students are able to take.   My\r\n\r\nquestion is how flexible can the JCs be. I hope we do not\r\n\r\nend  up  in a situation where, because of limitations  of\r\n\r\nspace,  time, manpower, it prevents students from  taking\r\n\r\nthe  subjects  of their choice.  Sir, I am not  sure  the\r\n\r\nextent  to  which the range of subjects  offered  by  the\r\n\r\ndifferent JCs isimilar.  It is not surprising to find one\r\n\r\nJC  developing  a  course  on  biochemistry  and  another\r\n\r\noffering theatre studies.  If we are to think out of  the\r\n\r\nbox  for  a moment, in the name of flexibility, will  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  consider  allowing  students  to  take  courses\r\n\r\nacross JCs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this point is important if we analyse the\r\n\r\npotential fate of the students in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3-year  Centralised Institutes.  Yes, their  numbers  are\r\n\r\nsmall.  And because their numbers are small, it will  not\r\n\r\nbe  a surprise to find that the range of subjects offered\r\n\r\nwill  be  lesser  than those in the JCs,  simply  because\r\n\r\nthere  are  no economies of scale. What is the extent  of\r\n\r\nflexibility  that  they  would  have  then?   Will  their\r\n\r\nsubject combination be limited to the subjects offered by\r\n\r\ntheir   respective  institutions?   Can  the  system   be\r\n\r\nflexible enough to allow these students to take a subject\r\n\r\nor  two in a JC?  Impossible?  Why not?  Just as the  ERC\r\n\r\nSub-committee  on Enhancing Human Capital  proposed  that\r\n\r\nNormal  students be allowed to take one or two \"O\"  level\r\n\r\nsubjects,   why  should  we  not  allow  the  Centralised\r\n\r\nInstitute students to take one or two subjects in the JCs\r\n\r\nand  to take their \"A\" levels for these subjects earlier?\r\n\r\nCertainly,  the  interaction with the  JC  students  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  further  cross  fertilisation  of  ideas  and\r\n\r\nexperiences  between  the  students.   It  would   foster\r\n\r\ninteraction  between  institutions and  help  bring  down\r\n\r\nartificial   social  barriers  between   the   supposedly\r\n\r\nbrighter  JC students and their country cousin  from  the\r\n\r\nCIs.   Yes,  it may be an administrative nightmare.   But\r\n\r\nsince  we are remaking almost everything around  us,  why\r\n\r\nnot  reconsider this too?  These \"A\" level  institutions,\r\n\r\nthe  JCs  and CIs can be clustered such that each cluster\r\n\r\nprovides  the  widest  range  of  subjects  to  encourage\r\n\r\nflexibility in subject combinations.  It is indeed a test\r\n\r\nof  our own system's ability to be flexible and adaptable\r\n\r\n-  values  that  the  changes hope to  inculcate  in  the\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries of the new system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard much about the\r\n\r\nproposed   Integrated  Programme  or  the   through-train\r\n\r\nprogramme. Sir, just before setting off, the conductor of\r\n\r\nan  actual  train will usually invite all  passengers  to\r\n\r\ncome  on board.  He will shout, \"All aboard.\"  But  sorry\r\n\r\nto say, this particular train is only for the top few.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notably, this proposal has drawn the most\r\n\r\nattention in the present debate.  Somehow, we often react\r\n\r\nat  the slightest indication of a policy that will result\r\n\r\nin  differentiating  people.   We  have  heard  arguments\r\n\r\njustifying streaming from the Ministry for the  umpteenth\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday,  Assoc.  Prof. Koo Tsai Kee eloquently  argued\r\n\r\nthat  labelling or stigmatising need not be  present,  if\r\n\r\nonly  society stops doing so.  He is right that labelling\r\n\r\nand  stigmatising are mere social constructions. They are\r\n\r\nman-made  and can be deconstructed. But he must  remember\r\n\r\nthat these are systemic processes that take place in  any\r\n\r\nsociety.  The  social construction is  dependent  on  the\r\n\r\nsocial  structures that exist and the values that prevail\r\n\r\nin  any  society.   These  structures  include  the  very\r\n\r\npolicies  that  we  are talking about today.   Unless  we\r\n\r\ndeconstruct  our value systems and social structures,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  escape from the natural processes of constructing\r\n\r\nlabels.   The  challenge is to continuously  manage  this\r\n\r\ncomplex  process and evaluate the costs and  benefits  to\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we cannot deny that the proposed\r\n\r\nthrough-train   programme  is   yet   another   streaming\r\n\r\nexercise.  Some Members have labelled it as the extension\r\n\r\nof the Gifted Education Programme.  The GEP targets 1% of\r\n\r\na  cohort, approximately about 500 students per year. The\r\n\r\nthrough-train programme targets 10% of a cohort  -  about\r\n\r\n5,000  per  year.  Sir, in the report, schools  like  RI,\r\n\r\nRGS,  ACS, Chinese High School are slated and set to roll\r\n\r\ntheir  through-trains on the fast tracks.  Sir,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Minister to provide the socio-economic\r\n\r\nprofiles of students in these schools who will board  the\r\n\r\nthrough-train.  What proportions of these  students  come\r\n\r\nfrom middle and upper-class backgrounds?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My worry is that we are perpetuating further the\r\n\r\nalready  existing differentiation.  One  may  argue  that\r\n\r\nthese schools are already in operation all this while and\r\n\r\nthe  students have been differentiated from the  students\r\n\r\nof  neighbourhood schools at present already. So what  is\r\n\r\nthe problem?  The problem is that with the new programme,\r\n\r\nthey will be further advantaged, compared to the students\r\n\r\nin  the neighbourhood schools.  At this time, we are  not\r\n\r\ninformed of how much resources will be allocated  to  the\r\n\r\nthrough-train programme but I will be surprised if the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresources  are  not significantly increased.   Otherwise,\r\n\r\nwhy talk about investing in their talents?  They will  go\r\n\r\neven  faster  and  even further from the  rest  of  their\r\n\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do acknowledge that the social divisions due\r\n\r\nto  our meritocractic principles are inevitable and have,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  been accepted here as a fact of life.  We  are\r\n\r\nalways separating the bright from the less bright in  the\r\n\r\nname of giving each child the potential to develop at his\r\n\r\nor  her  own pace.  It is the fundamental nature  of  our\r\n\r\nsystem.  Certainly it serves the needs of the nation  and\r\n\r\nthe  individual. Why hold someone back  when  he  can  go\r\n\r\nfaster  than the other?  But have we stopped for a  while\r\n\r\nand  asked what is the cost that we may incur if our  top\r\n\r\nperformers are not interacting with the less bright?   If\r\n\r\nwe   factor  in  socio-economic  status  (SES)  into  the\r\n\r\nequation, we will potentially be in a position where  the\r\n\r\nhaves are not sufficiently mixing with the have-nots.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the Minister can provide the House with the  socio-economic  background of this top 10% students  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthe  House  that the SES is indeed not a  factor  in  the\r\n\r\nequation.    If   the   top  10%  students   are   indeed\r\n\r\npredominantly middle and upper class children, I urge the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to put in place programmes that will facilitate\r\n\r\ngreater  exchanges and mixing between these students  and\r\n\r\nthe  rest of their cohorts.  Let us not widen the gap any\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, the digital divide has been one of the\r\n\r\ncontentious  outcomes of the streaming  processes.   Some\r\n\r\nresearchers  in  Britain  have argued  that  low  ability\r\n\r\npupils who are grouped homogenously compared to those who\r\n\r\nare   in   mixed  ability  groups  are  less  likely   to\r\n\r\nparticipate   in   school   activities,   exhibit   lower\r\n\r\nexpectations, experience more disciplinary  problems  and\r\n\r\nhave  higher  levels  of absenteeism and  non-completion.\r\n\r\nSir,  I do not have the figures, but anecdotal experience\r\n\r\nsuggests  that  this is not too far away  from  the  case\r\n\r\nhere.  Perhaps, MCDS can enlighten the House but my sense\r\n\r\nis that the higher proportions of juvenile offenders, for\r\n\r\nexample, are from the academically weaker streams.  As we\r\n\r\nfocus\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  attention on the cream on the top, let us not forget\r\n\r\nthe  residue  at the bottom.  My experience as  a  social\r\n\r\nworker  also suggests that many of them are not  able  to\r\n\r\nfit into the structured nature of the educational system.\r\n\r\nWhile  flexibility  has been argued to  benefit  the  top\r\n\r\nfliers, have we studied the possibility of providing  the\r\n\r\nunder-achievers with greater flexibility  too?   Are  our\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools  equipped  with  the  same  level   of\r\n\r\nflexibility?   I encourage MOE to pay attention  to  this\r\n\r\ngroup of Singaporeans whose survival will ensure that  we\r\n\r\nare able to consciously narrow the gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister said yesterday that\r\n\r\nthe   through-train  programme  is  targetted  to   allow\r\n\r\nstudents   who   can   do  well  with   less   structured\r\n\r\nenvironment.   As  the target is the  top  10%,  he  thus\r\n\r\nalluded  to the fact that the higher performers  will  do\r\n\r\nbetter in less structured environment compared to the not\r\n\r\nso high performers.  I am not sure what the basis of such\r\n\r\na  conclusion is.  I would appreciate it if the  Minister\r\n\r\ncan elaborate on that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report indicated that on average, 25% of a\r\n\r\nPrimary  One  cohort will do their \"A\"  levels.   If  the\r\n\r\nthrough-train programme is targetted at the top  10%,  it\r\n\r\nmeans that there are still 15% of students who will go on\r\n\r\nto  do their \"A\" levels, albeit after going through their\r\n\r\n\"O\"  levels.  This works out to about 7,500 students  per\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report identified that one of the criteria for\r\n\r\nthe through-train programme is that it \"must add value to\r\n\r\nthe   education  of  the  students  by  developing  their\r\n\r\ncapacities  for  creative and critical thinking,  and  by\r\n\r\noffering  special leadership development  and  other  co-curricular  programmes.   It must  optimise  the  use  of\r\n\r\nstudents'  time  to  provide them with  opportunities  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  their intellectual curiosity and to ensure  they\r\n\r\nacquire a broad-based education.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are indeed qualities that are\r\n\r\nrelevant  and critical to the new economy.  Indeed,  they\r\n\r\nare  very much in line with the objectives of the changes\r\n\r\nin  the  new  JC curriculum.  But what it means  is  that\r\n\r\nthese top 10% of the students will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprepared  with  the skills and knowledge that  will  help\r\n\r\nthem  do  well in their \"A\" levels and beyond.  Going  by\r\n\r\nthe  records,  these students will do well in  their  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevels  even  without the through-train  programme.   The\r\n\r\nprogramme will probably enhance their performance at  the\r\n\r\n\"A\"  levels, perhaps just marginally. If these skills are\r\n\r\ncritical for the 'A' levels examinations and for the  new\r\n\r\neconomy,  why are we not extending them to the other  15%\r\n\r\nwho  will end up doing their 'A' levels anyway?   I  have\r\n\r\nargued  earlier about the problem we face  today  on  the\r\n\r\ntransition  from 'A' levels to university education,  and\r\n\r\nthe  changes  to the JC curriculum aim to  address  this.\r\n\r\nBut  what  about the transition from 'O'  levels  to  'A'\r\n\r\nlevels?   Would these students not benefit from  it  even\r\n\r\nmore?  Why should they be deprived of something that will\r\n\r\nbenefit them?  Unless the skills are academic performance\r\n\r\ndependent,  which I do not think they  are,  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  reconsider and actually extend  it  to  the\r\n\r\nother  students at the upper secondary level.  I  believe\r\n\r\nit  will  greatly enhance their performance  at  the  'A'\r\n\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this brings me to my last point. The report is\r\n\r\nsupposed to look at the JC and upper secondary education.\r\n\r\nAs  far  as  I  understand,  upper  secondary  refers  to\r\n\r\nsecondary 3 and 4, focusing on preparing students for the\r\n\r\n'O'   levels,  while  the  JCs  are  the  post  secondary\r\n\r\neducational  institutions where students take  their  'A'\r\n\r\nlevel examinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes in the JC curriculum is certainly\r\n\r\nin  line  with  the  current system in the  universities,\r\n\r\nlocal  and abroad.  This is rightfully so since the  path\r\n\r\nis   clear  for  these  students  to  move  from  JC   to\r\n\r\nuniversity.  Of course, the skills to be acquired will be\r\n\r\nuseful for the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the through train programme seemingly aims at\r\n\r\nproviding this seamless progression from PSLE to the  'A\"\r\n\r\nlevels.   What  is  missing in the  report  is  thus  the\r\n\r\ntransition  from 'O' levels to 'A' levels  or  the  other\r\n\r\nroutes.    The   skills  like  creative  and  independent\r\n\r\nthinking,  etc,  will  also be  applicable  even  if  the\r\n\r\nstudents do not go\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  JC  and  take the polytechnic route  instead.   As  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier, what is even more important  is  that\r\n\r\nthose 15% students who are JC bound too, are the ones who\r\n\r\nwill  need  the  extra  help  in  blending  into  the  JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   My question is: what is the extent  of  the\r\n\r\nupper secondary curriculum, as it stands now, which is in\r\n\r\nline  with the proposed changes in the JC curriculum?   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  these  skills are important for  those  who  are\r\n\r\npolytechnic  bound.   The report fails  to  address  this\r\n\r\ntransition  from 'O' levels to the other paths.   I  urge\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry   to  study  this  gap  and   address   it\r\n\r\nconcurrently, as failure to do so will only  disadvantage\r\n\r\nthese groups of students further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we acknowledge that we are living\r\n\r\nin  very difficult and uncertain times.  The Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  for  Education, Dr Ng Eng Hen, has been quoted  as\r\n\r\nsaying  that  the \"education roadmap needs to  move  from\r\n\r\nuniformity  to  diversity, rigidity to flexibility,  from\r\n\r\nconformity   to   resilience,  and   from   moulding   to\r\n\r\nempowering.\"  These are indeed excellent targets to  work\r\n\r\ntowards.  We must, however, ensure that as we develop the\r\n\r\nsocial  structures through our policies to achieve these,\r\n\r\nthat  we  do  not inevitably divide our society  further.\r\n\r\nSocial  stratification  is part of  society,  but  policy\r\n\r\nmakers  must be conscious of the extent to which policies\r\n\r\nperpetuate  social stratification.  In the long  run,  we\r\n\r\nknow that whatever we are doing is best for Singapore and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Singaporeans must be made  to  understand\r\n\r\nand own this process.  Indeed, the nation is learning  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  the  schools are thinking.   We  now  want  our\r\n\r\nstudents also to think as much, as they learn to  acquire\r\n\r\nthe requisite skills to ensure their own survival.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me,\r\n\r\nfirst,  address one point raised by Mr Low  Thia  Khiang.\r\n\r\nHe  asked whether we really provide opportunities for our\r\n\r\npolytechnic students to study in our universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our polytechnics are developed as institutions in\r\n\r\ntheir own right.  They are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  pre-university centres or institutions.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nour  students  in  the polytechnics  are  trained  to  be\r\n\r\nemployable,  relevant to the industry.  The  Member  will\r\n\r\nfind  that  our  polytechnic students and  graduates  are\r\n\r\nrelevant  and  employable.  Indeed, the top  10%  of  our\r\n\r\npolytechnic  graduates  enter our universities  annually,\r\n\r\nand  I  believe that as we revamp the university  sector,\r\n\r\nmore   would   have   the  opportunity   to   enter   our\r\n\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to address specific queries from some\r\n\r\nMembers  on  National  Education,  values  education  and\r\n\r\ncharacter development.  I would like to thank Members   - Ms  Penny Low, Mr Wee Siew Kim, Ms Irene Ng and  Dr  John\r\n\r\nChen   -   for their support for the increased importance\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  co-curricular  activities  (CCA)  and  Ms\r\n\r\nIndranee Rajah for supporting MOE's efforts in developing\r\n\r\nthe character of our students.  However, listening to  Ms\r\n\r\nIndranee earlier, one would have the impression that  the\r\n\r\npoor manners of some motorists on our roads have been due\r\n\r\nto the weaknesses of our education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take through some of the things we have done\r\n\r\nin  our  schools  as  far as National  Education,  values\r\n\r\neducation and character development are concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October this year, I gave the House an update on\r\n\r\nthe  National Education (NE) activities, the  Civics  and\r\n\r\nMoral Education (CME) programme, co-curricular activities\r\n\r\n(CCA)  and  other  learning activities conducted  in  our\r\n\r\nschools to imbibe sound values in our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Character Development through Co-Curricular Activities</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools place great emphasis on developing the\r\n\r\ncharacter  of  their students through  a  wide  range  of\r\n\r\nactivities and programmes.  Besides CME lessons, there is\r\n\r\na  variety  of  co-curricular activities  (CCA)  such  as\r\n\r\nuniformed   groups,  sports  or  games  which   inculcate\r\n\r\ndesirable traits in our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports and games are an excellent way to promote\r\n\r\nfriendship and bonding.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents  learn  to work together in  the  pursuit  of  a\r\n\r\ncommon  goal.  Strong friendships emerge from sharing  in\r\n\r\nthe  joys of winning or the dejection of defeat.  It also\r\n\r\nhelps  to  promote  bonding, understanding  and  teamwork\r\n\r\namongst  participants.  The uniformed groups are  another\r\n\r\nmeans  by which students are introduced to the ethos  and\r\n\r\nvalues   of  being  part  of  a  team.   Through  various\r\n\r\nactivities,  students  develop positive  traits  such  as\r\n\r\nperseverance, resilience and adaptability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCAs expose students to real world problems where\r\n\r\nthey  need  to understand that solutions to the  problems\r\n\r\nthey  face  are  not  cast in stone.   It  will  put  our\r\n\r\nstudents' capacity to think to the test.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students are also actively engaged in community\r\n\r\ninvolvement  projects (CIP) that give them an opportunity\r\n\r\nto  contribute their efforts to the good of others.   The\r\n\r\nCIP  was introduced in 1988 to nurture our pupils  to  be\r\n\r\nsocially  responsible  and to help them  understand  that\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean has a role to play  in  enhancing  the\r\n\r\nwell-being   of  the  community  and  the  country.    In\r\n\r\nparticipating in community work, the members also  learn,\r\n\r\nfrom  a young age, the value of service and of developing\r\n\r\nenduring friendships with one another.    All students do\r\n\r\na minimum of six hours of CIP.  In fact, in some schools,\r\n\r\nas  I reported in October, students clock in more than 20\r\n\r\nhours  a  year.  Since year 2000, schools have also  been\r\n\r\nintroduced to the concept of Service-Learning.   Service-Learning  is  an approach where the CIP participants  not\r\n\r\nonly  serve the community but also learn to identify  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of the community and to reflect on their community\r\n\r\ninvolvement  process so that they can  better  appreciate\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students have partnered with various grassroots\r\n\r\nand community organisations in carrying out CIP.  Through\r\n\r\nthese  partnerships, they also learn to work with  adults\r\n\r\nin  the community.  Sir, I appreciate the views given  by\r\n\r\nMiss  Low  and I would like her to know that our  schools\r\n\r\nare  expanding the opportunities with the community, only\r\n\r\nas  far  as  the  community wants  to  partner  with  the\r\n\r\nschools.  If community organisations and community\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders  take the opportunity to work the schools,  I  am\r\n\r\nvery  sure our schools will also extend a hand.   In  the\r\n\r\nprocess,  both our students and our community will  learn\r\n\r\ntogether to appreciate each other's contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>National Education</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with increasing globalisation and mobility, a\r\n\r\nperson's  sense  of identity is less tied  to  the  place\r\n\r\nwhere  he  was born.  The sense of belonging to Singapore\r\n\r\ncould   weaken.   National  Education  is  necessary   to\r\n\r\nreinforce  national instincts and citizenship  values  so\r\n\r\nthat  our students remain rooted to the country  as  they\r\n\r\nspread their economic wings overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Education aims to develop national\r\n\r\ncohesion, the instinct to fight for Singapore's  survival\r\n\r\nand instil confidence in its future.  It aims to foster a\r\n\r\nsense   of   identity,   pride   and   self-respect    as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,    to    understand   Singapore's    unique\r\n\r\nchallenges, constraints and vulnerability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim suggested that National Education be\r\n\r\nemphasised  through  Project Work  and  perhaps  the  new\r\n\r\n`Knowledge and Inquiry' subject.  I would like  to  thank\r\n\r\nMr  Wee for his suggestion.  He would be pleased to  know\r\n\r\nthat schools already infuse National Education across the\r\n\r\nformal curriculum and non-academic programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the JC level, National Education is integrated\r\n\r\ninto the General Paper whose aim is to enable students to\r\n\r\nappreciate  the inter-relationship of ideas  from  across\r\n\r\ndisciplines  and  broaden  their  global  outlook   while\r\n\r\nremaining   mindful  of  shared  historical  and   social\r\n\r\nexperiences, both within Singapore and regionally.  Essay\r\n\r\ntopics  could, therefore, be set that allow  students  to\r\n\r\nconsider   issues   from   an   NE   perspective.     The\r\n\r\ncomprehension passage could deal with topics  of  concern\r\n\r\nto  Singaporeans.   Both Project Work (PW)  and  the  new\r\n\r\nelective subject `Knowledge and Inquiry' require students\r\n\r\nto  explore  a  range  of issues and ideas,  which  could\r\n\r\ninclude   getting   students   to   consider   NE-related\r\n\r\nperspectives. There is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsufficient scope for PW projects as well as KI topics  to\r\n\r\ndeal with National Education issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the secondary level, NE is delivered through\r\n\r\nsubjects  such  as  Social Studies where  students  learn\r\n\r\nabout  Singapore's  arduous road to nationhood.   Through\r\n\r\ncase  studies,  they are introduced to the principles  of\r\n\r\ngood  governance, and the dangers that befall  those  who\r\n\r\nare  divided  by  racial and religious strife.   Students\r\n\r\nunderstand   the  importance  of  racial  and   religious\r\n\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools also conduct a wide variety of programmes to\r\n\r\nenable  students  to  internalise  the  NE  values.   For\r\n\r\nexample, schools celebrate the different ethnic festivals\r\n\r\nto   raise  students'  awareness  and  consciousness  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding of multi-racialism and its importance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the Learning Journey Programme, which\r\n\r\nwas  launched  in  1998.  Students visit  key  Government\r\n\r\ninstitutions  like the Parliament House,  URA,  and  also\r\n\r\nimportant facilities like the PSA.  Through these visits,\r\n\r\nstudents  come  to  grips with the constraints  Singapore\r\n\r\nfaces in terms of size and resources.  They also begin to\r\n\r\nappreciate  how Singaporeans have succeeded  against  the\r\n\r\nodds  by  standing  together, and working  creatively  to\r\n\r\novercome  the physical limits that the size of  our  land\r\n\r\nhas imposed on us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a child's experiences in school form only\r\n\r\npart  of  the  efforts in cultivating a  sense  of  love,\r\n\r\nloyalty   and   belonging  to  Singapore.   The   family,\r\n\r\ncommunity and the society play no less critical  role  in\r\n\r\nshaping  the  values  of our young.   On  its  part,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education will continue with its efforts  to\r\n\r\nimprove  its  National  Education programme  in  all  our\r\n\r\nschools to ensure all our pupils are imbued and instilled\r\n\r\nwith  a  greater sense of love, loyalty and belonging  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Added   Emphasis  on  Values  Education  in  Revised   JC curriculum</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new revised JC curriculum reinforces our efforts\r\n\r\non values education and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharacter  development.  To underscore our commitment  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  holistic  education  to  our  students,   the\r\n\r\nCommittee has recommended that more emphasis be given  to\r\n\r\nthe non-academic domain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be more opportunities, inside and outside\r\n\r\nof  schools,  for  students to  engage  in  projects  and\r\n\r\nventures that will help develop initiative, independence,\r\n\r\nand an entrepreneurial mindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will be required to meet minimum\r\n\r\nrequirements  in co-curricular activities  and  character\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programme in order to graduate  from  junior\r\n\r\ncollege.    A   holistic  certification  will   also   be\r\n\r\nintroduced  whereby  the  CCA achievements  and  academic\r\n\r\ngrades  of  students are reflected in a single `A'  level\r\n\r\ncertificate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, schools cannot shoulder this responsibility\r\n\r\nof  shaping young hearts and minds alone.  The family  is\r\n\r\nkey  to  bringing  up our children with the  right  moral\r\n\r\nvalues and sound character.  As we strive to develop  our\r\n\r\nstudents'  talents  and equip them with  the  skills  and\r\n\r\nknowledge  to  tackle the challenges in a knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy,  parents and teachers cannot neglect the  softer\r\n\r\naspects of our children's education.  Values like loyalty\r\n\r\nto the country, compassion for the community and friends,\r\n\r\nperseverance and moral integrity, will stand  our  youths\r\n\r\nin  good stead.  For in the end, Singapore will have  won\r\n\r\nthe  battle  but lost the war if the next  generation  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  grow up smarter in the head but  weaker  in\r\n\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure Members that as we\r\n\r\nembark  to  revamp the JC and Upper Secondary  Education,\r\n\r\nthe  MOE  does not neglect character development,  values\r\n\r\neducation  and  National  Education.   Our  schools   are\r\n\r\nfocusing  on  the pursuit of what I called the  3Cs,  two\r\n\r\nless  than  the  pursuit  of average  Singaporeans.   The\r\n\r\nschools may use different terms, but the 3Cs I mean cover\r\n\r\nthese things: Competency, Change-Management Capabilities,\r\n\r\nand  Character  Development.  But I  must  add  that  the\r\n\r\ninculcation of desirable values cannot just be the job of\r\n\r\nMOE.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment,  parents  and the community  must  also  play\r\n\r\ntheir part.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for allowing me to join in this debate on the motion,\r\n\r\nstanding in the name of the Minister for Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I thought about the motion, I thought back about\r\n\r\nthe  entering cohort of medical students who  started  in\r\n\r\nuniversity with me.  One has become a very good musician,\r\n\r\none  a playwright, a few have become bankers, a few  have\r\n\r\nbecome good businessmen, real estate developers - not all\r\n\r\nfinished their medical course - but all became successful\r\n\r\nin their own ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in thinking of these people, I thought about the\r\n\r\nsecond  part  of  this motion, which endorses  a  greater\r\n\r\ndiversity  and opening of new pathways in  JC  and  Upper\r\n\r\nSecondary Education, to cater to different strengths  and\r\n\r\ninterests of students.  Twenty years ago, and I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthis  strikes a chord with many Members, many of  us  and\r\n\r\nparents  would  have said that the route  to  advancement\r\n\r\nlies  in the professions, therefore, get yourself a  good\r\n\r\n\"A\"  levels, go into one of the professional courses  and\r\n\r\nafter that you can think about it.  I think this new  set\r\n\r\nof reforms sends a strong signal that we mean what we say\r\n\r\nin  wanting to show people that there are many, many ways\r\n\r\nof  achieving  success, that Singapore  needs  a  broader\r\n\r\ndefinition of success if we are to face the world ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an unashamedly meritocratic and competitive\r\n\r\nsociety.   No matter what MOE reforms are put  in  place,\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporean parents and Singaporean kids themselves\r\n\r\nwill always strive for excellence, and subject themselves\r\n\r\nand  their children to perhaps a little too much pressure\r\n\r\nto  succeed.  These reforms will not change this  because\r\n\r\nit  is  an  ingrained habit, and perhaps not such  a  bad\r\n\r\nthing.  But what I think we would need to change is  this\r\n\r\nbroadening of the Singaporean mind.  And I think this  is\r\n\r\nvery,  very important because it is the broad minds,  the\r\n\r\nagile minds,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsucceed in the new economy, even though that itself is  a\r\n\r\ncliche by now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do hope to achieve is a long term shift in\r\n\r\nsociety's attitudes and direction towards a more thinking\r\n\r\nand  creative  nation  -  a nation  of  leaders  and  not\r\n\r\nfollowers alone.  We need a couple of Thomas Edisons, not\r\n\r\na  couple of thousand of candle-makers.  Yet the  biggest\r\n\r\nimpediment to the success of these proposed changes is, I\r\n\r\nthink,  fear.   And  I  think these fears  are  two-fold.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  a  fear  of change.  Some have expressed  fears\r\n\r\nthat  our  teachers are not used to the  system.   Others\r\n\r\nfear  that their children would not be able to cope  with\r\n\r\nthis new system.  Secondly, a fear of missing the boat  - a  lack  of bridges between the EM3, EM2 and EM1 segments\r\n\r\nof  society, so to speak.  Many of those who have  talked\r\n\r\nabout  the through-train approach also fear that some  of\r\n\r\nthese  young people might fall between the stools in  the\r\n\r\nthrough-train system.  Many have expressed the fear  that\r\n\r\nin  households  where English is not  the  main  language\r\n\r\nspoken  at home, there will be children who would not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  cope and not be able to benefit from these  new\r\n\r\nreforms.   But  I think we can actually deal  with  these\r\n\r\nfears  separately, and indeed some of  these  issues  are\r\n\r\nvery important, but they should be dealt with separately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the matter before us today is that we\r\n\r\nneed to give our brightest and best new routes to success\r\n\r\nbecause the \"A\" level education model that has served  us\r\n\r\nso  well  in  the  past is perhaps  no  longer  the  most\r\n\r\nsuitable model for Singapore's future needs.  Yet,  I  am\r\n\r\nglad  that the report has recognised the great  value  of\r\n\r\nthe  brand name of the Singapore \"A\" levels and  that  we\r\n\r\nmust  not  only provide for the acquisition of  technical\r\n\r\nknowledge, but also for the development of the spirit  of\r\n\r\ninquiry and creativity, and the development of morals and\r\n\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is really also about the best way to use\r\n\r\nthe  time  available  to  prepare Singaporeans  who  will\r\n\r\nbenefit from a university education, to be qualified  for\r\n\r\ncompetitive  admission to local and foreign universities.\r\n\r\nWith the proposed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchanges, individuals can reach a university education  by\r\n\r\neither proof of achieving academic excellence, or through\r\n\r\nproof  of  academic competence, accompanied by  proof  of\r\n\r\nexcellence in some other fields, such as the arts  or  in\r\n\r\nsports.   Is it perfect?  Perhaps not.  Because  just  as\r\n\r\nthere  are  limitations in designing, say,  a  car  or  a\r\n\r\nmilitary  tank,  where  one has  to  balance  fire-power,\r\n\r\nprotection  and  mobility in one fighting vehicle,  there\r\n\r\nare  also  only 24 hours in a day, and there is  only  so\r\n\r\nmuch  that  one  can cram into a young mind  in  a  week.\r\n\r\nInstead   of   fire-power,   protection   and   mobility,\r\n\r\ntherefore, we have to balance breadth of knowledge, depth\r\n\r\nof  knowledge  and  the ability to  apply  knowledge.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  there  are no easy solutions, and  there  is  no\r\n\r\nperfect  design - only the possibility of a design  which\r\n\r\nis  best  able  to  suit  our particular  needs  and  our\r\n\r\nparticular point in history.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore of the future will have more and more\r\n\r\npeople  with degrees.  In fact, if you look around world-wide  trends,  the  tendency for many  of  the  developed\r\n\r\ncountries  is for the majority of the so-called  educated\r\n\r\nworkforce  to have some degree or other.  The issue  then\r\n\r\nis: what will a degree be worth?  And, if everybody has a\r\n\r\ndegree, why would then people fight to get a degree?   We\r\n\r\nare  familiar with what has been happening in the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  where there is a move towards getting everybody\r\n\r\nto  have some sort of university experience.  We need  to\r\n\r\nask  ourselves  if the aim of our system is  to  make  it\r\n\r\npossible  for all people to go to university.  I  believe\r\n\r\nit is not.  And, if not, what will then be the value of a\r\n\r\nuniversity degree?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system aims to ensure that all Singaporeans will\r\n\r\nhave the skills to earn a living, to understand the world\r\n\r\naround  them,  after  a fashion, and  to  understand  the\r\n\r\nsociety  they live in and their own place in the society.\r\n\r\nI  believe  this  has been very well stated  through  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education's goals in education.  But  we  are\r\n\r\nalso  unique  in  that we do this through  a  variety  of\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  culminating in the ITE,  polytechnics  and\r\n\r\nuniversity education routes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we recognise these different routes to\r\n\r\nsuccess,  we  are focused today on the route  that  leads\r\n\r\ntowards university education.  We need to recognise  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a bell curve for academic excellence and  there\r\n\r\nis  no getting around that bell curve - you are either at\r\n\r\nthe  beginning, the middle, or the end of it.  But we can\r\n\r\nrecognise the existence of other bell curves, and that we\r\n\r\ncan  recognise that some of the people who are  otherwise\r\n\r\njust  competent, to benefit from a university  education,\r\n\r\nmay  be actually the excellent end of the bell curves for\r\n\r\nsome  other skills.  And I think it is a societal  choice\r\n\r\nwhether  we should be allowing them the chance  to  enter\r\n\r\nuniversity.  I personally believe that it would be a good\r\n\r\nthing  for  us  to recognise this type of excellence  and\r\n\r\nallow  these  people  to  enter  university  because   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, university education, like it or not,  is  one\r\n\r\nof the big prizes of our system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realise that not everyone would know what he\r\n\r\nwants  to do later in life at the age of 16 or 18.   This\r\n\r\nnew  system will make it easier for young people to  make\r\n\r\nbetter choices and prevent premature shunting into fields\r\n\r\nwhich one may not have wanted to go into.  In thinking of\r\n\r\nthat,  I think of my friends, some of whom were asked  to\r\n\r\ngo  into  certain professional fields, even though  their\r\n\r\nown  hearts say otherwise.  Also, not everyone will  have\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  a  family that  values  exposing  their\r\n\r\nchildren to a wide range of general knowledge topics,  or\r\n\r\nto  the  opportunity to travel.  But again, these new  JC\r\n\r\nand  Upper  Secondary reforms will  make  it  easier  for\r\n\r\nchildren, even from less privileged backgrounds, to  have\r\n\r\ntheir worlds opened up to different experiences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to another point, I believe we should aim to\r\n\r\nreduce the wastage of potential.  Currently, while one in\r\n\r\nfour  of  our Primary One cohort will sit for  their  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevels,  only  80% of these candidates will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nqualify  for  admission  to a  local  university.   I  am\r\n\r\nparticularly  heartened by the news that even  with  this\r\n\r\nnew  system, the 3-year pre-university centres will still\r\n\r\nbe retained, to allow those who need to develop at a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut,  as  with other speakers before me, I think that  we\r\n\r\nshould  be dealing with the problem perhaps a little  bit\r\n\r\nearlier.   I think we really need to be finding  ways  to\r\n\r\nsupport  those who come from households where English  is\r\n\r\nnot  widely  spoken, where the children actually  already\r\n\r\nturn  up in lower primary school and upper primary school\r\n\r\nwith   significant  disadvantages,  vis-a-vis   language.\r\n\r\nBecause  with this new system, where you have  to  defend\r\n\r\nyour  thoughts  and learn to present your ideas,  if  you\r\n\r\nhave  got  a  language  difficulty,  you  have  a  double\r\n\r\ndifficulty.   Yet,  I  think  the  answer  is  not  about\r\n\r\nlevelling  everybody  down, but  it  is  about  levelling\r\n\r\neverybody  up,  and  trying  to  narrow  the  gap   where\r\n\r\npossible.   I  think that the introduction of specialised\r\n\r\nschools  for  sports and people who are talented  in  the\r\n\r\narts,  as  well as the introduction of this through-train\r\n\r\nsystem,  with the potential of not having to sit for  the\r\n\r\n\"O\"  level is wonderful, because we have been talking for\r\n\r\nso  long  about  the lack of flexibility  in  our  school\r\n\r\nsystem.  And I think many of us would have heard from our\r\n\r\nfriends  that,  \"Well, we have decided to send  so-and-so\r\n\r\nabroad  because  he  could not  cope  with  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nflexibility.\"  Well, we are now going to have flexibility\r\n\r\nin  our  local  school system.  Let us see whether  these\r\n\r\nchildren can cope.  Yet the challenge, I believe, is  not\r\n\r\nso  much  in  setting up these schools,  but  in  getting\r\n\r\nparents  to buy into the idea of an alternative  path  to\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened by the new emphasis on socialisation\r\n\r\nand  on  learning of social skills in our new curriculum.\r\n\r\nThis  is  very  important.  I would also  argue  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  perhaps  include  some  learning  about  cultural\r\n\r\nsensitivity,  perhaps even religious  sensitivity.   Much\r\n\r\nhas been said about learning how to be outspoken, but you\r\n\r\nknow  we  live in Asia, and perhaps some of our  English-stream  students  also need to learn a  little  bit  more\r\n\r\nabout  the cultures in the countries around us, where  it\r\n\r\npays  sometimes to be a little bit quiet at certain times\r\n\r\n- part of doing business, right?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened by the introduction of this new\r\n\r\nsubject  called Knowledge and Inquiry, which  will  train\r\n\r\nstudents to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevaluate  the  validity and relevance of new observations\r\n\r\nin theories and teach them how to defend their arguments,\r\n\r\nto  apply  their theories to present-day  realities.   We\r\n\r\nknow,  at  a  time when so many people claim  to  have  a\r\n\r\nuniversity  degree, what makes people stand  out  is  how\r\n\r\nwell  they  can  deal  with changes, and  actually  apply\r\n\r\nknowledge,  and also evaluate a statement that  has  been\r\n\r\nput forward to them.  Prof Low Seow Chay actually pointed\r\n\r\nout  that  perhaps  if one were to use this  business  of\r\n\r\npractical  work  or project, that soon there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nwhole industry, perhaps of people wanting to sell project\r\n\r\nwork.   But  I  believe there are new  computer  systems,\r\n\r\nsmart systems, that can detect plagiarism of this nature.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not such a bad thing because, I think the Bible\r\n\r\nsays  that  there are not that many new things under  the\r\n\r\nsun.  The challenge for us is actually to make use of the\r\n\r\navailable  knowledge  that  is  out  there  on  the  web,\r\n\r\neverywhere, to rehash it, to look at ways to present  it,\r\n\r\nso  that it becomes something new.  If our kids can learn\r\n\r\nto do that with commercial term papers, maybe that is not\r\n\r\nsuch a bad thing.  That is called synthesis of knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we also should consider teaching our JC\r\n\r\nstudents about basic statistical concepts, even  if  they\r\n\r\nare  not  headed for statistics as a course.   We  should\r\n\r\nteach  them  about  circular arguments  and  concepts  of\r\n\r\nmanagement.   This  is about teaching  our  young  to  be\r\n\r\neducated  consumers - educated consumers of  information,\r\n\r\nof advertisements, of goods and services.  Teaching them,\r\n\r\nas it were, to be a bit more street-smart in a structured\r\n\r\nSingapore way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also heartened that these changes will be\r\n\r\nimplemented  only in the year 2006.  I am confident  that\r\n\r\nthis  would  give MOE the time to refine the syllabi  and\r\n\r\ntrain  the  necessary teachers to undertake  the  new  JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum.  I am confident that people described as  old\r\n\r\nworkhorses and old teachers actually will be able to meet\r\n\r\nthe  challenges.   Because after all, we  are  trying  to\r\n\r\nremake  the  whole  of Singapore, why not  the  teachers?\r\n\r\nWhat  I  am  perhaps  a little less  confident  about  is\r\n\r\nwhether we can change parental attitudes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should tell parents and students who are\r\n\r\nnow  in  Secondary  1 or Secondary 2 that  these  changes\r\n\r\nwould  soon  affect  them.  We can pilot  some  of  these\r\n\r\nconcepts  now,  maybe  we  do not  have  to  make  it  an\r\n\r\nexamination subject.  We can also ensure that we will not\r\n\r\ninadvertently  increase the tendency for people  to  take\r\n\r\nsubjects  that  score more As by devising  some  sort  of\r\n\r\nthinking  skills  type  of questions  so  that,  even  in\r\n\r\nScience-based   subjects,  only  those   who   can   show\r\n\r\nindependent  thinking  or higher order  of  thinking  and\r\n\r\ndeeper  understanding  can  get  this  'A'.   That  would\r\n\r\nperhaps  balance the field for those who are  taking  the\r\n\r\nArts type courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, we recognise the multiplicity of\r\n\r\neducational models out there in the world, and that  this\r\n\r\nmultiplicity  of educational models suggests  that  there\r\n\r\nare  either many ways to achieve excellence in education,\r\n\r\nor  none  of  the methods out there really is  foolproof.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  should  choose the  best  model  for  our\r\n\r\nnation's needs and not be ashamed about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also echo the call for a second chance to be\r\n\r\nmade  available for children who are brave enough to  try\r\n\r\nthis something new and who have made a mistake in perhaps\r\n\r\nmaking  their  first  choice.   It  has  been  said  that\r\n\r\nSingapore could not afford to give people a second chance\r\n\r\nin  education because of scarce educational resources  in\r\n\r\nthe  early  days.  This would have been true a generation\r\n\r\nago.   But  what is scarce now is our young people.   Our\r\n\r\nyoung  people's innate potential should and must  not  be\r\n\r\nwasted.   If we do not make some form of a second  chance\r\n\r\nthe  cornerstone of these reforms, I fear that  we  would\r\n\r\nonly perpetuate the tendency of Singaporeans to take only\r\n\r\nthe safe route to success.  We would then have failed  in\r\n\r\none  of  our most important tasks, that of nurturing  the\r\n\r\ncreative, entrepreneurial and 'never say die' spirit that\r\n\r\nwe so much admire and strive for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with those who say that we should not\r\n\r\nstart off with the top 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not fear failure as a nation when we are changing\r\n\r\nthe  system.   But  I  think,  as  Singaporeans,  we  are\r\n\r\ncautious.   And it is perfectly reasonable to  start  off\r\n\r\nwith  the  top  10% because these are probably  the  very\r\n\r\npeople  who are most likely to be able to cope  and  deal\r\n\r\nwith  change successfully.  I am sure that MOE will  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  these experiences to make the changes  down  the\r\n\r\nline.  As someone else has said, \"Look, I understand what\r\n\r\nit  is like to help my little girl with the project  work\r\n\r\nin primary school.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if these reforms succeed, I am confident\r\n\r\nthat we can sell the product, call it the \"Singaporean JC\r\n\r\neducation\",  to  paying students from around  the  region\r\n\r\nand,  in  doing  so, enlarge our potential immigrant  and\r\n\r\ntalent pool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Thank you for allowing me to\r\n\r\njoin in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being the 21st speaker, I think it is extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult  at this late hour also to enthuse  anybody  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to focus on what anybody has to say after  this.\r\n\r\nBut I do beg your indulgence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Deputy Speaker(Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.35 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report, Sir, on reforms to our junior college\r\n\r\nand  upper  secondary  education  is  indeed  timely  and\r\n\r\nnecessary.   Moving this debate to a broader plane,  this\r\n\r\nis  not  just  about  how  we  educate  our  students  in\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools and junior colleges.  More importantly\r\n\r\nto  me, it is about how we develop our human resources to\r\n\r\nfully  benefit  from  a global economy  that  is,  today,\r\n\r\nhighly  integrated,  and  when  the  key  differentiating\r\n\r\nfactor  is no longer technology and capital but keyboard.\r\n\r\nThose with the right education, skill sets, aptitudes and\r\n\r\ncapabilities    will   be   able   to   fully    maximise\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries, the income gap is widening.\r\n\r\nSingapore is no exception, although our situation may not\r\n\r\nbe as bad as other countries.  Increasingly, a clear\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  distinct line is drawn between those with  education\r\n\r\nand   skills  and  those  without.   Indeed,  it  is  our\r\n\r\nobligation and duty to ensure that everyone can aspire to\r\n\r\na higher income and a better life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see education and training as critical factors,\r\n\r\nnot  only  in achieving economic efficiency but  also  in\r\n\r\nensuring social equity.  In fact, education has been  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  social leveller in our society.  In  Singapore,\r\n\r\nit  does not matter what social background one comes from\r\n\r\nas opportunities are provided for all to transcend social\r\n\r\nbarriers  and  climb up the ladder.  This  is  one  major\r\n\r\ncontributing factor for the high level of social cohesion\r\n\r\nthat  we enjoy in Singapore today.  And this is something\r\n\r\nthat we must continue to emphasise and propagate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate, Sir, a bit about how job\r\n\r\nsegmentation  has  taken  place based  on  education  and\r\n\r\nskills.   This  is really a global and not just  a  local\r\n\r\nissue,  and  why  we have to pay close attention  to  the\r\n\r\neducation  system  if we do not want  to  perpetuate  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  unemployment  among  the  unskilled  or  low\r\n\r\nskilled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US Department of Labour, Sir, estimated that in\r\n\r\nthe  1990s,  occupations that required a  college  degree\r\n\r\nwere  growing  twice as fast as others.  At the  European\r\n\r\nUnion  level,  the  1995  White Paper  on  Education  and\r\n\r\nTraining  had  identified the need for  all  citizens  to\r\n\r\ndevelop a knowledge base that would help them find  their\r\n\r\nway  in  the information society.  It warned against  the\r\n\r\ndanger  of social exclusion among some groups in  society\r\n\r\nbased on lack of knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developed countries, the patterns of employment\r\n\r\nhave   changed  dramatically.   Within  firms   in   such\r\n\r\ncountries,  the labour market has become  more  and  more\r\n\r\nsegmented.   Employers have reorganised their  work  into\r\n\r\ntwo  categories - core and non-core work.   Core  workers\r\n\r\nare those with high skills and non-core workers are those\r\n\r\nwith  little or no education, or possess obsolete skills.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, core workers receive better pay and have\r\n\r\ngreater   stability  of  employment.   Whereas   non-core\r\n\r\nworkers treated as the peripheral\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkforce  enjoy low status, low pay, and  absolutely  no\r\n\r\nsecurity of employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As multinational companies operate across borders,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  isolate  ourselves  against  such  employment\r\n\r\npractices.   I  see the role of our education  system  as\r\n\r\nensuring   that  our  workers  remain  as  core  workers.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  we  may end up as non-core  workers  and  the\r\n\r\nforeign  talents become core workers on our  own  shores.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, it is therefore important that our school\r\n\r\nreforms  also  adequately  focus  on  the  need  of   the\r\n\r\nmajority,  and  not just increasingly the small  band  of\r\n\r\nstudents at the top.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key question I would like to ask is whether the\r\n\r\nreforms  have  gone far enough and fundamentally  examine\r\n\r\nthe way we have structured our primary, secondary and  JC\r\n\r\neducation.   Although this Report is  meant  to  initiate\r\n\r\nreforms to upper secondary education, I note that it  has\r\n\r\nbasically  left  upper  secondary education  intact.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  the only reform to upper secondary education  will\r\n\r\naffect only the top 10% of each cohort who qualifies  for\r\n\r\nthe  Integrated Programme where seamless upper  secondary\r\n\r\nand JC education is provided for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the present system, students are streamed\r\n\r\ninto  different  streams  after  their  PSLE  examination\r\n\r\nresults.  Those who are academically inclined go  to  the\r\n\r\nfour-year  Express Stream.  Whereas those  who  are  less\r\n\r\nacademically  inclined, or need more time,  are  streamed\r\n\r\ninto   the   five-year  Normal  (Technical)   or   Normal\r\n\r\n(Academic) programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some countries have integrated general and\r\n\r\nvocational  education in unique ways and,  in  this  way,\r\n\r\nbetter  prepare  students  for  either  an  academic   or\r\n\r\nvocational path.  An example is Norway, where  the  first\r\n\r\ntwo years of education are given at school.  The students\r\n\r\nin Norway must choose different, more specialised courses\r\n\r\nduring  the second year.  These are provided in  schools,\r\n\r\nwhilst  others  are workplace-based.  The academic  track\r\n\r\nentails three-year courses.  Under the vocational  track,\r\n\r\nstudents  have  two years of school-based  education  and\r\n\r\nanother two years of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napprenticeship  training.   The  concluding   specialised\r\n\r\ntraining  takes place in the workplace.  In total,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be 190 different craft or journey-man certificates.\r\n\r\nI  have  been told that some of these have been collapsed\r\n\r\nto  about  a  broad  band  of  15  to  20  categories  of\r\n\r\ncertificates and skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying, Sir, that the Norwegian system is a\r\n\r\nbetter alternative.  They revamped their education system\r\n\r\nin  1994.  But I certainly think that there is scope  for\r\n\r\nus to rethink the way in which our secondary education is\r\n\r\nstructured  and ask the question whether it really  meets\r\n\r\nthe  needs of the students and the economy.  In our case,\r\n\r\nalthough  a  Normal (Technical) student would have  spent\r\n\r\nfive  years in secondary school, at the age of 17  years,\r\n\r\nhe  would  still have insufficient basic  skills  and  be\r\n\r\ninadequately prepared for a job.  Only when he  has  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  another two years in ITE, then would he  acquire\r\n\r\nbasic skills and a certificate to enter the workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really think that there is greater scope for the\r\n\r\nMOE  to examine this issue.  It can perhaps look into how\r\n\r\nto better integrate the Normal (Technical) education with\r\n\r\nITE   education  so  as  to  ensure  a  progressive   and\r\n\r\nconsistent build up of skills and competency.  I  frankly\r\n\r\ndo  not  see much of that continuous flow now.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to suggest that MOE examine this aspect and consider\r\n\r\nthe  feasibility  of creating better  pathways  from  the\r\n\r\nNormal (Technical) education with ITE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are currently spending a lot of resources,\r\n\r\ntime  and effort to re-skill and find jobs for our lower-end workers who are retrenched or unemployed.  We have to\r\n\r\nensure that 10 to 20 years down the road, this pattern is\r\n\r\nnot repeated.  The answer to that, of course, lies in our\r\n\r\npresent   education  system  and,  in   particular,   the\r\n\r\neducation  for those who are less academically  inclined.\r\n\r\nBased on what I have said earlier, I think we need to pay\r\n\r\nsome  attention  to  this  issue and  critically  examine\r\n\r\nwhether the existing system, in particular, our secondary\r\n\r\neducation,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeets  the needs of these students and adequately prepare\r\n\r\nthem with the necessary skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related point, Sir, I would also like to join\r\n\r\nother colleagues in asking that not only JC students  and\r\n\r\nthose  in  the top 10% of the upper secondary  cohort  be\r\n\r\nequipped with thinking skills.  There is, in my  view,  a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of over emphasis on preparing students for\r\n\r\nuniversity  education.  It is as if only  those  who  are\r\n\r\nclearly demarcated for university education need to  have\r\n\r\nthinking, communicating and other process skills when one\r\n\r\nwould  argue  that  all students  who  come  out  of  our\r\n\r\neducation  system need such skills, if they are  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  needs of an innovation driven economy.  For example,\r\n\r\nSir,  if  we  have  a  technician who has  no  university\r\n\r\neducation, do we not want him to have the same  abilities\r\n\r\nto think, apply and communicate as the engineer with whom\r\n\r\nhe  is  working?  I would argue that all  who  enter  the\r\n\r\nworkforce would need such skills.  And there is therefore\r\n\r\na  need  to  review  the  entire school  curriculum  from\r\n\r\nprimary school onwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Minister of State for Education has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  such core skills are already being taught  in\r\n\r\nprimary  and secondary schools, the fact that we are  now\r\n\r\nreforming our JC curriculum clearly shows that  there  is\r\n\r\ninsufficient focus placed on such skills.  The importance\r\n\r\nof  having  foundation basic core skills cannot  be  over\r\n\r\nemphasised.   In  the  1990s, Sir,  a  US  Commission  on\r\n\r\nachieving  necessary skills defined the role of education\r\n\r\nand  identified  the kind of core skills that  should  be\r\n\r\ntaught  in  American schools.  It described the  role  of\r\n\r\ngeneral  education  as  providing  individuals  with  the\r\n\r\nminimum  requirements  to function  productively  in  the\r\n\r\nworkplace.    The  focus  should  be  on  basic   skills,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  ability to identify,  analyse  and  solve\r\n\r\nproblems,  the capacity to learn new skills in  order  to\r\n\r\nadapt to new work tasks, the ability to communicate  with\r\n\r\nothers   and  use  information  independently,   planning\r\n\r\nskills,   computer  literacy  and  a  grasp   of   simple\r\n\r\nscientific knowledge and technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the World Bank research has shown that, in some\r\n\r\ncountries, workers who have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompleted  secondary school have a 50% greater chance  of\r\n\r\nreceiving  on-the-job training than those with a  primary\r\n\r\nschool  education  alone.  The World Bank  also  suggests\r\n\r\nthat  training in specific skills is more effective  when\r\n\r\ntrainees  are  already  literate and  numerate  and  have\r\n\r\nproblem-solving skills that they can build upon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, the reform of the JC curriculum\r\n\r\nand those at the top 10% of the cohort would better place\r\n\r\nsuch  students  to  acquire higher skills  and  integrate\r\n\r\neffectively into our economy.  In order to allow students\r\n\r\nof  all  achievement levels to benefit, I would also  ask\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Education look into the curriculum\r\n\r\nof the whole secondary school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two other brief points that I wish to\r\n\r\ntouch  on.   I  would like to ask that  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  also pay adequate attention to the  needs  and\r\n\r\ntraining of our teachers.  In this regard, I am not  sure\r\n\r\nwhether 2004 will give us sufficient time to prepare  the\r\n\r\nteachers for the Integrated Programme, and I do ask  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry review regularly the staffing requirements,\r\n\r\nso that teachers would not be overloaded and will be able\r\n\r\nto   deliver   the   changes  in  the  education   system\r\n\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate, Sir, that in recent years, attempts\r\n\r\nhave been made to reduce the workload in the non-teaching\r\n\r\nareas for our teachers, but I believe that more could  be\r\n\r\ndone  to  help teachers prepare for the new methodologies\r\n\r\nand concepts that they are now required to teach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope, Sir, that the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nwill come out with effective communication materials,  so\r\n\r\nthat parents understand these reforms and will not be  so\r\n\r\nbewildered.  Some parents I have spoken to do  not  quite\r\n\r\nunderstand what is going on.  This is because there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  many  changes to our education  system.   This  has\r\n\r\ncaused  a  certain amount of confusion and concern  among\r\n\r\nparents.   I  would  like to suggest  that  schools  work\r\n\r\nthrough  their PTAs to reach out to parents, particularly\r\n\r\nthose who have children in secondary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, our education system has served\r\n\r\nSingapore  well.  It has brought us to the present  level\r\n\r\nof  development  and helped us overcome  several  crises.\r\n\r\nThe  path  ahead is fraught with uncertainties, both  for\r\n\r\nthe  economy  and the labour market.  People  have  asked\r\n\r\nwhat  do we hope to get out of our education system.   My\r\n\r\nhope,  Sir,  is  very simple - that we will  continue  to\r\n\r\nprovide   students   of   all  social   backgrounds   and\r\n\r\ncapabilities  with  the  opportunity  to  develop   their\r\n\r\npotential to the fullest and, at the end of the day, have\r\n\r\nthe   skills  and  capacity  to  weather  change,  remain\r\n\r\nemployed and live a good life.  I believe, Sir, that  the\r\n\r\ncurrent reforms will contribute towards that outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion as proposed\r\n\r\nby the Minister for Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore enters into the global economy, we must\r\n\r\nequip  our  people to develop niches to stay  competitive\r\n\r\neconomically  and  lead a higher quality  of  life.   The\r\n\r\nimpact   of  information  technology  and  the   changing\r\n\r\nlandscape of the global economy have posed new demands on\r\n\r\nour  economy  and  workforce.  While  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nworking  on remaking Singapore, we must also retrain  our\r\n\r\npresent  workforce and prepare our future generations  to\r\n\r\nface these new challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a different set of skills and mindsets to\r\n\r\ncompete and excel in a knowledge-based economy.  To be  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful  global player, we must have a workforce  that\r\n\r\nis creative, innovative and full of passion to excel.  At\r\n\r\nthe same time, our education system must equip our people\r\n\r\nwith skills to lead a meaningful and happy life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the revamp of the JC and upper secondary\r\n\r\neducation curriculum is a step in the right direction  to\r\n\r\nnurture  our students for a globalised future.  I support\r\n\r\nthe  change  from  efficiency to diversity,  focusing  on\r\n\r\nbroad-based  skills training.  But I am  concerned  about\r\n\r\ngiving students\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  flexibility to decide on the scope of content of  a\r\n\r\nsubject they wish to take.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our students are very practical and\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  well informed to make good  decisions  when\r\n\r\nchoosing  subjects.   Thus,  many  will  take  the   easy\r\n\r\noptions,  ie, choosing subjects which are easy  to  pass,\r\n\r\neasy  to  score  and  are taught by easy-going  teachers.\r\n\r\nThis  may  affect  the desired outcomes of  the  revamped\r\n\r\ncurriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to highlight three areas of concern in\r\n\r\nthe proposal by the Education Review Committee:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Holistic approach to revamp our education\r\n\r\nsystem;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Quality assurance system to ensure sustainable\r\n\r\nquality output; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Creative and innovative learning environment for\r\n\r\nour students.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Holistic approach to education</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should adopt a holistic approach to revamp\r\n\r\nthe  entire  education system, and not just  the  JC  and\r\n\r\nupper secondary curriculum.  As stated in Annex J of  the\r\n\r\nReport,  the desired outcomes of each level of  education\r\n\r\nhave   undue  influence  on  the  succeeding  levels   of\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be effective in nurturing our future generations,\r\n\r\nwe  must  also  revamp  the curriculum  of  the  primary,\r\n\r\nsecondary and tertiary institutions.  Thus, I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe Minister to consider making the necessary changes  to\r\n\r\nthe other levels of education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the implementation of compulsory\r\n\r\neducation, all students will spend a number of  years  in\r\n\r\nour  educational institutions.  Inadvertently, some  will\r\n\r\nonly  be able to complete their education up to a certain\r\n\r\nlevel.   Therefore,  we  must re-look  into  the  desired\r\n\r\noutcomes  of  the  different  levels  of  education   and\r\n\r\nconsider embedding thinking skills into the content-based\r\n\r\nsubjects  of primary and secondary school curricula  too.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnurturing  of  our  students will be more  complete,  and\r\n\r\nstudents who complete different levels of education  will\r\n\r\nbe  equipped with different skills to fit into our global\r\n\r\nworkforce and lead a reasonable quality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Quality assurance system</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to achieve consistent desired outcomes in our\r\n\r\neducation  system, we need to develop a quality assurance\r\n\r\nsystem  which  is  internationally recognised.   We  must\r\n\r\nensure  that  the key quality processes in our  education\r\n\r\nsystem  are  in  place, and devise a  regular  check-and-balance  mechanism  to achieve sustainable  quality.   We\r\n\r\nmust have quality input and quality processes in order to\r\n\r\nproduce  quality output at every educational level.   The\r\n\r\nquality  of students, curriculum and teachers  will  play\r\n\r\nsignificant roles in determining the desired outcomes  of\r\n\r\nour education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must change the mindsets of both our educators\r\n\r\nand  parents  that  school curriculum  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nreviewed  at  certain regular intervals, eg,  every  five\r\n\r\nyears.   These reviews are necessary so as to update  our\r\n\r\ncurriculum to cope with the dynamic changes in the global\r\n\r\neconomy.   If possible, a panel of education and industry\r\n\r\nexperts   should  be  formed  to  guide   the   continual\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our school curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also have an accreditation system which\r\n\r\nwill   make   our   school   curriculum   internationally\r\n\r\nrecognised.  This will provide additional impetus to make\r\n\r\nSingapore  an education hub, and facilitate students  who\r\n\r\nwish to study overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we must provide adequate training to\r\n\r\nour  existing and future pool of teachers and  principals\r\n\r\nto  be  creative  and  innovative.   In  particular,  the\r\n\r\nleadership skills and passion of our principals will make\r\n\r\na  great  difference  to  the  desired  outcomes  of  our\r\n\r\neducation system.  To achieve this, we must first  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our  educators  are equipped with  thinking  skills\r\n\r\nbefore  even considering revising our curriculum.   Thus,\r\n\r\nquality control in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  principals and teachers  is  crucial  in\r\n\r\nachieving the desired outcomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, principals and teachers should be rotated\r\n\r\nevery   five   or   six  years,  both  horizontally   and\r\n\r\nvertically,   among  different  levels   of   educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  This will provide good exposure  for  them\r\n\r\nto  understand  the  different needs and  aspirations  of\r\n\r\ndifferent   groups  of  students  and   parents.    Where\r\n\r\npossible,  JC and upper secondary school teachers  should\r\n\r\nbe  given  the  opportunity to lecture or  tutor  at  our\r\n\r\ntertiary institutions.  This will provide them with first-hand  experience in understanding the quality of students\r\n\r\nentering the tertiary institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how can we measure the desired outcomes of our\r\n\r\neducation system?  The existing criteria are rather broad\r\n\r\nand   difficult  to  measure.   We  should  develop  some\r\n\r\nquantitative tools to measure the output.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must also be a mechanism where employers,\r\n\r\nalumni,  tertiary institution lecturers,  principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers  can provide regular feedback to our educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions  to  further improve our quality  processes.\r\n\r\nBoth  the industry and our educational institutions  must\r\n\r\nshare   the   same   vision  of  nurturing   our   future\r\n\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Creative and innovative learning environment</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has provided one of the best\r\n\r\neducation infrastructures for our students.  Schools  and\r\n\r\neducational institutions are well equipped with  abundant\r\n\r\nresources to facilitate teaching and learning.   What  is\r\n\r\nlacking  is  the development of a creative and innovative\r\n\r\nlearning  culture in our institutions.  To  emphasise  on\r\n\r\nhardware  alone  may not produce the desired  results  of\r\n\r\nencouraging our students to be creative and innovative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a more supportive learning environment where\r\n\r\nschools, parents, employers and students can work closely\r\n\r\ntogether  to  nurture  our  students.   There   must   be\r\n\r\neffective communication among\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprincipals, teachers, employers, parents and students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constant engagement of all parties involved will\r\n\r\nprovide useful information for all to better support  and\r\n\r\nguide  our students to develop their potentials.  With  a\r\n\r\nbetter-educated population in the future, I am  confident\r\n\r\nthat  communication  will improve for  all  concerned  in\r\n\r\nnurturing  our future generations.  This will  strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  partnerships of all stakeholders, thus  spearheading\r\n\r\nour education system to greater heights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further facilitate learning, I would propose that\r\n\r\nthe  JC  and upper secondary school curriculum be  taught\r\n\r\nusing  a  modular  system.   In our  examination-oriented\r\n\r\neducation system, using a modular teaching approach  will\r\n\r\nprovide  more opportunities for students to interact  and\r\n\r\nwork  on projects.  Students will only need to study  two\r\n\r\nor  three subjects per semester for examination purposes.\r\n\r\nThis will reduce much stress and facilitate more creative\r\n\r\nlearning among students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>5.55 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion in the name\r\n\r\nof  the Minister for Education on the recommendations put\r\n\r\nforward  by  the  JC/Upper  Secondary  Education   Review\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we compel our children to go to school, we\r\n\r\nassume collectively an overwhelming responsibility.   For\r\n\r\na   period  of  10  years  or  more,  the  children   are\r\n\r\nconscripts,  and  there  are  youths  who  mitigated  the\r\n\r\nseriousness of this fact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school experience is a gift. It is for the\r\n\r\nchildren's  own good, so we say, with genuine intentions.\r\n\r\nDo we realise that the school experience is as good as we\r\n\r\nmake  it  to be?  In the same breath, I ask: is  it  good\r\n\r\nenough for the society that will come into being when the\r\n\r\npresent  one  is  gone?  Would our children  have  become\r\n\r\npeople   who   rejoice  in  the  exercise   of   creative\r\n\r\nintelligence, equipped for what\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlies  ahead?  This question needs to be asked  and  asked\r\n\r\nagain,  and  reconsidered, as knowledge and circumstances\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the educational enterprise needs to be\r\n\r\nmanaged.  It needs to be managed effectively, and this is\r\n\r\nprecisely  what we are attempting to do.   Singapore  has\r\n\r\ntravelled  a  long  way  in our short  history.   We  are\r\n\r\nevolving from an industrial-based economy to a knowledge-based  one.   The  engines of growth  are  knowledge  and\r\n\r\ninnovation.   Likewise,  our education  system  has  been\r\n\r\nsubject to multiple changes in accordance with the  needs\r\n\r\nof nation-building.  It has generally served us well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the time has come to revisit the core beliefs\r\n\r\nand  review  them.  The rationale for a  review  is  very\r\n\r\nclear.   Our children need to be better prepared for  the\r\n\r\nknowledge age.  Secondly, diversity needs to be  injected\r\n\r\ninto  the  system  to  cater to the different  needs  and\r\n\r\ntalents of our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes will revolve around two central\r\n\r\nideas.   Firstly,  the  need to develop  thinking  skills\r\n\r\nthrough a revised JC curriculum.  I wonder whether we can\r\n\r\nactually  teach  creativity.  Perhaps, an  atmosphere  of\r\n\r\nspontaneity is a natural way to encourage one to explore,\r\n\r\ndiscover  and create.  Secondly, students with  different\r\n\r\ntalents  and  aptitudes will have alternative  routes  to\r\n\r\nembark  upon.  The proposed changes will cater  to  their\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is felt that the JC curriculum seriously\r\n\r\nneeds  to change its focus.  In the past, it was obsessed\r\n\r\nwith  content.  Today, the emphasis must be on developing\r\n\r\nknowledge skills that are increasingly in demand.   Tools\r\n\r\nof  reasoning  and interpretation would be  the  building\r\n\r\nblocks  of independent research.  A re-look at the  scope\r\n\r\nand content of JC subjects would be imperative, if indeed\r\n\r\nwe   are  to  provide  students  with  more  breadth  and\r\n\r\nflexibility.  Curriculum content may need to be downsized\r\n\r\nto  accommodate the introduction of new subjects and  the\r\n\r\nincreased emphasis on the non-academic curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern, Sir, stems from parents' expectations.\r\n\r\nWe  have to allay their worries and make them understand.\r\n\r\nChanges, to some of them, may be radical and unjustified.\r\n\r\nJC  subjects will be redefined to keep up with the latest\r\n\r\nadvancements  in  science,  technology  and   information\r\n\r\ntechnology.   It is also proposed that any  subject  that\r\n\r\ncuts   across  traditional  disciplines  and  adopts   an\r\n\r\nintegrative approach can and should be introduced.   Take\r\n\r\na  subject like bio-chemistry, for example, it has become\r\n\r\na  must for anybody who wishes to embark on the field  of\r\n\r\nlife  sciences.  I think it is good that MOE is exploring\r\n\r\nintroducing this subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-academic area also deserves much attention\r\n\r\nif  we  are  serious about developing more wholesome  and\r\n\r\nwell-rounded students.  It is good to know that  the  co-curricular   activities  would  be   allocated   a   high\r\n\r\npercentage for university education.  Until now,  I  must\r\n\r\nsay  that  it  all  sounds well  and  good  but  have  we\r\n\r\nconsidered the serious ramifications of this approach  of\r\n\r\nlearning?   For  example, the changes in  the  curriculum\r\n\r\nstructure  may  be matched by changes in assessment.   As\r\n\r\nsuggested  in  the report, we may need to go  beyond  the\r\n\r\ntraditional pen and paper test and introduce new  methods\r\n\r\nof  testing  critical thinking if we  can  indeed  assess\r\n\r\ncritical thinking and creativity effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the assessment system may be complex\r\n\r\nin  nature,  even  subjective.   How  will  students  and\r\n\r\nparents  alike  react  to  this?   We  can  expect   that\r\n\r\ndifferent teaching approaches become possible as students\r\n\r\nare encouraged to experiment, explore and discover.  This\r\n\r\nis  surely a step forward for all.  We must keep in  mind\r\n\r\nthat  the  proposed changes can only work with  the  full\r\n\r\ncooperation  of teachers and staff.  Will  they  then  be\r\n\r\nadequately trained?  Implementation definitely will  have\r\n\r\nsome   teething  issues  and  we  will  need  to  prepare\r\n\r\nourselves for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am in full support of the\r\n\r\nseamless upper secondary/\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJC  education proposal.  The reason is obvious.  Students\r\n\r\nthat  are especially ready for universities need  not  be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  two examinations over a  period  of  three\r\n\r\nyears.   The through-train period will undoubtedly remove\r\n\r\nthe elements of interruption and wasted opportunities.  I\r\n\r\nknow  for  a  fact that, as it is now, the JC 1  students\r\n\r\nresent  having to pass yet another examination to get  to\r\n\r\nJC  2 where in fact, the examination that matters is  the\r\n\r\nGCE  \"A\" levels.  Theoretically, the through-train system\r\n\r\nsounds simple but how do we prove that the GCE \"O\" levels\r\n\r\nis  unnecessary to some?  What happens to these  students\r\n\r\nif  they  fail  their GCE \"A\" levels or the International\r\n\r\nBaccalaureate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee proposed that the IP schools that\r\n\r\ndo  not  offer  \"O\" levels will continue to have  school-based  assessments  to  measure the  students'  progress.\r\n\r\nWill  under-performing  students  have  to  transfer   to\r\n\r\nanother  school?   Will  the  employment  industry  adapt\r\n\r\nquickly to the new types of qualifications that they  may\r\n\r\ncome across or will the students have to bear the painful\r\n\r\ncost  of  convincing the would-be employers?  Old  habits\r\n\r\ndie  hard,  so  they say.  More often than  not,  policy-makers  may  not  always be able to  see  the  unexpected\r\n\r\nresults of these changes.  IP schools can also be  viewed\r\n\r\nas  a  disguised  form of streaming, as mentioned  by  my\r\n\r\nearlier colleagues.  Elitists, as it is called, to  some.\r\n\r\nHow do you manage these concerns?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Committee highlighted\r\n\r\nthe  pertinent issues of privately-funded schools.   What\r\n\r\ncan  they  contribute?   How do we  position  them?   One\r\n\r\nimportant  advantage  with private schools  is  to  allow\r\n\r\nfamilies  who  have been away to come  home  and  educate\r\n\r\ntheir  children in Singapore.  Providing this alternative\r\n\r\nis  a  sensible move.  I personally know of a family  who\r\n\r\nreturned  and was compelled to emigrate again when  their\r\n\r\nchildren  simply could not cope with the constraints  and\r\n\r\nthe  requirements of our national schools.  The  language\r\n\r\nissue  and  the different curriculum can be  overwhelming\r\n\r\nfor  both  children  and parents alike.   Exposing  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforeign students within these private schools can also be\r\n\r\nbeneficial to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, some concerns with regard to\r\n\r\nsuch  private  entities.   If  we  are  not  cautious,  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  model  may  ultimately  emerge,  positive   or\r\n\r\nnegative,   one  incongruous  to  our  fairly  homogenous\r\n\r\neducation  landscape.   While we should  provide  greater\r\n\r\nvariety  and choice for Singapore students,  we  have  to\r\n\r\ntake  steps  to  ensure  that the desired  standards  are\r\n\r\nmaintained.   Also, the national education policy  should\r\n\r\nbe adhered to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final concern pertaining to the private school\r\n\r\ninitiative    is   the   exclusive   nature    of    such\r\n\r\nestablishments.   Should  they  grow  in  popularity  and\r\n\r\nbecome  relatively costly, what will happen to  the  less\r\n\r\nendowed  or  the have-nots?  Will they be  denied  entry?\r\n\r\nThe  proposal  to set up specialised independent  schools\r\n\r\ncould  not  have come at a better time.  It is an  urgent\r\n\r\nresponse  to  the  diverse needs and aspirations  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents.  This diversity will be our pillar of  strength\r\n\r\nas  we  face  the very challenges of the  future.   These\r\n\r\nschools  will offer support to students with  talents  in\r\n\r\nthe  specific  fields like arts, sports, Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nScience.   May  I  suggest that  perhaps  more  areas  of\r\n\r\nspecialisation  could be considered.  As opposed  to  the\r\n\r\nprivately-funded schools, this category of  schools  will\r\n\r\ncomplement,  if  not,  enhance our  education  landscape.\r\n\r\nSuccess  is almost certain as the relevant agencies  will\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged  to  take  the lead  in  this  initiative,\r\n\r\nnaturally  with  the  support of MOE.   We  already  have\r\n\r\nagencies  with  the appropriate expertise,  networks  and\r\n\r\nspecialised  resources that can be mobilised  to  support\r\n\r\nthis  endeavour.  Also, if I may add, in  the  long-term,\r\n\r\nthe  related industries must be developed to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthese  students have fruitful careers and can  contribute\r\n\r\npositively to the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I take one last look at the sweeping reforms we\r\n\r\nintend to carry out, I envisage the challenge that awaits\r\n\r\nus  and,  that is, to skilfully strike a balance  between\r\n\r\nthe  objectives that are in fact contradictory.   On  one\r\n\r\nhand,  we  need to engage students in greater breadth  of\r\n\r\nlearning, on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother, we must maintain the depth of our JC subjects.  We\r\n\r\nspeak of importance of flexibility, yet we will not  want\r\n\r\nto compromise the present rigour of our education system.\r\n\r\nHence,  balancing  such opposing  objectives  will  be  a\r\n\r\nchallenge  for all stakeholders.  Only then will  reforms\r\n\r\nbe successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the recommended changes and\r\n\r\nreforms  may  be unsettling but they will  certainly  add\r\n\r\ncolour   to  our  education  landscape.   It  is   indeed\r\n\r\nencouraging to note that we presently recognise the  need\r\n\r\nto  teach our young different life skills and we are bent\r\n\r\non  acting upon this realisation.  Perhaps sometime soon,\r\n\r\nwe  will realise that developing such abilities may  need\r\n\r\nto  begin at a younger age.  The impressionable years are\r\n\r\nprecious and time may not be on our side. Hence, it  will\r\n\r\nbe   worthwhile  for  the  Ministry  to  consider  making\r\n\r\ncomparable changes for the foundation years.   Like  many\r\n\r\nof  my fellow colleagues before me, I would like to  add,\r\n\r\nand  I  cannot emphasise this enough, that at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  day,  all  the  beautiful  plans  and  instructional\r\n\r\nobjectives  will  mean  very  little  if  they  are   not\r\n\r\nimplemented properly.  Hence, I earnestly hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry will give full support in terms of resources  to\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  and  principals to ensure  that  our  true\r\n\r\nobjectives are met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have\r\n\r\nhad  a  long day.
