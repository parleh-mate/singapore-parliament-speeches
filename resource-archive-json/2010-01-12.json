and (b) by scaling back the financing assistance schemes and the eventual discontinuation of the schemes in January 2011, how it will&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1997</p>affect the SMEs and whether it will hamper efforts to grow our own local MNCs.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the global financial crisis, financial institutions became more&nbsp;risk-adverse. To ensure that local enterprises have sufficient financial resources to continue to operate, invest, trade and internationalise, existing business and trade financing schemes were enhanced significantly in December 2008 and the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative (SRI) was launched during Budget 2009.&nbsp;These measures have been successful in alleviating the credit tightness.&nbsp;Since December 2008, more than 14,000 loans worth about $8 billion have been catalysed under both the SRI and enhanced business and trade financing schemes.&nbsp; More than 13,000 companies, of which more than 90% were SMEs, benefited from the schemes. The total amount of loans given was more than&nbsp;five-and-a-half times the loan amount given out under Government-assisted schemes over the one year period prior to the changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the improvement in economic conditions, credit conditions have eased.&nbsp; The major economies worldwide have stabilised and appear on the way to recovery. Nonetheless, we are cognisant that smaller companies, especially those in badly affected sectors, may still face difficulty accessing commercial credit. At the same time, there remain challenges in the credit insurance markets as well as in cross-border financing. We therefore decided to extend the SRI and enhancements to the business and trade financing schemes for another year until end January 2011, with some scaling back on lending terms. The one year extension will help companies adjust as the economy makes the transition from recession to growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1998</p>In the steady state, Government loan schemes are not intended to replace the commercial lending markets. They are meant to facilitate viable companies, but with higher risk profiles, access credit. Companies with lower risk profiles should be able to access commercial lending to meet their needs, especially amidst the recovering commercial credit market.&nbsp;The scale back in the SRI and the various business and trade financing schemes have been primarily in the Government&rsquo;s risk share, rather than to the eligibility criteria or type of loan facility supported. Based on the current profile of loans, the scaled backed business and trade financing schemes will still be sufficient to meet the needs of the vast majority of SMEs, for instance, the revised BLP loan quantum cap of $2 million is still sufficient for more than 95% of past SME loans. After the discontinuation of the SRI in 2011, SMEs will still be able to tap on the mainstay Government financing schemes, which were in place before the recession.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B> Thank you, Minister, for the comprehensive response.&nbsp;Two additional questions. One is, among those companies that were eligible for this scheme, have there been&nbsp;cases of default, what were the reasons and how much was written off? Second question is, there has been a spike in insurance premiums from 0.15% to 0.45%.&nbsp;This is likely to add on to the overhead costs for SMEs. Would the Minister re-consider lowering it?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are still monitoring the default rates. As Members can well imagine, the loans that were taken up in end 2008 and 2009, ought not to be going bad so soon. So I think it is still too early to tell.&nbsp;We are still tracking the default rates.&nbsp;Suffice to say the rates so far still reflect pre-crisis levels but, nonetheless, we should expect the rates to go up as the loans progress. On the trade insurance premium rates&nbsp;&ndash; we <p align=left>Column: 1999</p>recognise that the trade financing markets are still rather weak and that is the reason why we kept most of the terms intact.&nbsp;We have not changed the terms. The only thing that we have adjusted is the premium rate and this is to raise the premium rate from 15 basis points to 45 basis points.&nbsp;But Members must see this in context of the pre-crisis rate which was 75 basis points. So we are still very supportive but we must make that transition. We cannot keep the rate at the previous 15 basis points.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:PRIVATISATION OF POWER GENERATION COMPANIES--><p align=left>Column: 1999<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:PRIVATISATION OF POWER GENERATION COMPANIES:::2003--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>PRIVATISATION OF POWER GENERATION COMPANIES</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Benefits to Singaporeans--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Benefits to Singaporeans)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Viswa Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.<B>&nbsp; Mr Viswa Sadasivan</B> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how Singaporeans have benefited from the liberalisation and privatisation of power generation companies; and (b) whether competition in this sector has helped to reduce costs on a sustainable basis through the desired efficiency gains.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the electricity industry was liberalised in 2001.&nbsp;We established a regulatory framework for a competitive electricity sector and created the Energy Market Authority (EMA) as the industry regulator.&nbsp;The objective was to foster competition in the market, so as to encourage energy industry players to reduce costs and become more efficient and, thereby, benefit customers.&nbsp;Since liberalisation, we have seen the entry of new power generation companies.&nbsp;Keppel Merlimau Cogen has entered the market, and Island Power is planning to do so.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have already seen the benefits of competition in the electricity market.&nbsp; Power generation companies have moved towards newer and more efficient <p align=left>Column: 2000</p>technologies.&nbsp;Prior to liberalisation, most of our electricity was generated by steam plants powered by fuel oil.&nbsp;Today, more than 80% of our electricity is generated by combined cycle plants fuelled by natural gas.&nbsp;Such gas-fired plants enjoy better efficiencies that translate into lower costs.&nbsp;These lower costs have benefited consumers directly.&nbsp; For example, over the past eight years, since the liberalisation of the electricity market, the price of fuel oil (to which our gas price is pegged) has increased by 160%, from $38.30 per barrel&nbsp;in April 2001 to $99.38 per barrel in January 2010.&nbsp; Fuel accounts for about half of the total cost of generating and transmitting electricity to homes. Despite that, the electricity tariff for households has increased over the same period by only 15%, from 19.87 cents per kWh in April 2001 to 22.87 cents per kWh in January 2010.&nbsp;Along with competitive prices, the reliability of our electricity supply has remained amongst the highest in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in any market, effective regulation plays an important role. Under the Electricity Act, EMA has the powers to act against behaviour which could have an adverse impact on competition in the market. EMA will continue to review and enhance the regulatory and legislative framework to ensure that the market functions properly and that all consumers enjoy the benefits of competition.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Viswa Sadasivan (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Viswa Sadasivan (Nominated Member):</B> I thank the Minister.

Could these not have been achieved without liberalisation?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Iswaran:</B> If I understand the Member's question correctly, the point is whether the same benefits could have been achieved without liberalisation. I think this is a bit of a conjecture because at the end of the day, we are dealing with <p align=left>Column: 2001</p>hypotheticals. I would say that the evidence across the world demonstrates that when you have liberalisation, which basically means you open up the sector to allow more players to come in to compete, and achieve several advantages.&nbsp;The first is efficiency gains because they compete to bring their costs down in order to gain a competitive advantage, <I>vis-a-vis</I> each other, which is quite different to the behavioural or incentives for a single market player.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, when you have a diversity of players, they bring with them different technological backgrounds and different market experiences which will enrich the market environment we are in. For example, in our market today, after the divestment of the Generating Companies (gencos) by Temasek, we have players from China, Japan, France, Malaysia and also from Singapore. We have significant diversity and each of these players&nbsp;has a footprint not just in Singapore but around the world in different markets. So these are benefits that are clear and I think they would be difficult to achieve if we had not gone through liberalisation. So I would say in summary that it is a difficult question to answer because it is hypothetical but I would say that the evidence, when you look at experiences around the world, including places like Australia and Britain which have liberalised since the 1990s, I think it is quite clear that that is the better path if we want to achieve a system that is efficient and that brings benefits to consumers.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> I have three supplementary questions for the&nbsp;Minister. Firstly, is the average Singaporean household paying more or less for electricity over, say, the last 10 years? Question two is that indeed if there are differences in the amounts paid, are these differences attributable to the competition factor or is it due to other reasons <p align=left>Column: 2002</p>affecting the changes in prices? The third question is can Singaporeans look forward to electricity prices that will remain stable and not increase faster than wage increases?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Iswaran:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for the questions. Firstly, are households paying more? Sir, I just gave statistics that compared to&nbsp;eight years ago, prices are 15% more costly per kWh, so the answer must be yes. And Member asked what is the source of this cost increase? Is this due to competition? Competition mitigates against the cost rises. In fact, that is the evidence we have seen in our market and it has also been the experience in many other markets.&nbsp;So that is a&nbsp;clear outcome that we have achieved. Having said that, when you compare across jurisdictions, and say that \"Well, price in Singapore is <I>x</I> and price in country A is <I>y</I>. Why is there a difference?\" There are many other factors that come into play. One of them is the mix of fuels they use. In Singapore, we use 80% gas and our gas is pegged to fuel oil prices. In many of the countries we compare with a substantial amount of electricity comes from coal-fired plants. Now coal is cheaper and coal does not price in externalities like carbon emissions and so on. That is one point of comparison&nbsp;&ndash; what is the energy mix they use?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, in some of these jurisdictions, there are also subsidies. The subsidies mask the true price of electricity and, therefore, when we compare, we must compare like for like and take into account the different constraints the different jurisdictions face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third question is can households expect stable electricity prices? It is difficult to answer this.&nbsp;It is a little bit of crystal-ball gazing which I do not like to indulge in but I would make this point. I think our experience in recent times and, really, when you look ahead, what it <p align=left>Column: 2003</p>suggests is that volatility is going to be part and parcel of the energy markets of the world.&nbsp;This is because as you have business cycles, as you have demand growing and subsiding, there is a concomitant impact on energy demand and therefore in the way prices move. The recent crisis was a case in point. In the 18-month period, we have seen the oil price go from a peak down and it is now back up again to around $90. So volatility is something we must get used to. The long term trend is probably upward because of the various fundamental pressures like more demand for energy from developing markets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have going for us is that our market is a strong and competitive one. So we are able to etch out as many efficiencies as we can. And secondly, in our system, whilst we do not have subsidies, we have other measures which help our households cope with some of these price increases. The chief among which is the Utilities-Save&nbsp;programme which Members would be familiar with. For example, if you take a three-room HDB household, the average monthly electricity bill may be about $60. After we take into account the Utilities-Save rebates, assuming they use it fully to defray the costs, the cost per month will be reduced by about 25%, down to say $40 to $45 a month. These are the ways we help to mitigate the impact on households. But we cannot insulate Singapore or Singaporeans from the global energy market and the long term trends or volatility in global energy prices.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:NEW METHODS FOR TEACHING CHINESE LANGUAGE--><p align=left>Column: 2003<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:NEW METHODS FOR TEACHING CHINESE LANGUAGE:::2007--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>NEW METHODS FOR TEACHING CHINESE LANGUAGE</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Siong Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.<B>&nbsp; Mr Teo Siong Seng</B> asked&nbsp;the Minister of Education in view of the new Chinese Language teaching methods to cater for average students coming from non-Chinese speaking home environment, what assurance or choice will his Ministry give to parents who want their children to <p align=left>Column: 2004</p>perform well or do much better than average students in the Chinese Language studies and examinations.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Nominated Member Mr Teo Siong Seng has asked for some assurance from my Ministry for parents who want their children to perform well in the Chinese language studies and the examinations. I have given much of the assurance during the recent Principals Ceremony and the press reported about it. But this is a useful occasion to reiterate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me, first, preface my remarks by giving the general directions of the&nbsp;Chinese language changes that we are&nbsp;going to undertake.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>And, as we have said, this is&nbsp;to respond to the&nbsp;ongoing trends in home language environments where the majority of Chinese households use English as the dominant language. But here I would agree with the Nominated Member of Parliament that the aim remains to help all students progress as far they can or want to because we do&nbsp;want to ensure that Chinese learning remains relevant and engaging, and help students learn the language in settings and modes which they are likely to use in their daily life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This dominant use of English&nbsp;&ndash; which is now 60% among all Chinese households and as well as Indian households&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;will mean a wider spread of capabilities in Chinese Language (CL) among students. The proposed CL approach is to cater to the entire spectrum and not only a select band. The NMP has asked for assurance and I would first say that, yes, we will continue to support those who can attain high levels of Chinese Language proficiency and I will give some details. But we must also recalibrate our expectations and teaching methods for the broad middle band from mainly English-speaking homes and for students who now face exceptional <p align=left>Column: 2005</p>difficulties in learning the Chinese Language.&nbsp; We will provide more details during the upcoming Committee of Supply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In direct response to the Member,&nbsp;students with good CL ability will continue to receive support if they offer Higher Chinese Language.&nbsp; Currently, about a quarter of our students are taking Higher Chinese at the PSLE and the \"O\" Levels.&nbsp; At the \"A\" Levels, students may opt to take Chinese Language and Literature at the Higher 2 or even the Higher 3 level instead of&nbsp;the Higher 1 level.&nbsp; Other \"A\" Level subjects are available for students to hone their Chinese Language skills or deepen their understanding of China.&nbsp; These include General Studies in Chinese, China Studies in Chinese, or History in Chinese.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond these formal subject offerings, MOE provides opportunities for greater depth of study and enrichment through special programmes.&nbsp; As you know, we have&nbsp;15 SAP (Special Assistance Plan) primary schools and 10 SAP secondary schools, and each of them with their own school-based flagship programmes to nurture an interest in Chinese Language and culture.&nbsp;I am sure that many Members have visited these schools.&nbsp; They are very entrepreneurial, they have a lot of community support and very interesting programmes that they&nbsp;are conducting and we will encourage them and will give them adequate resources.&nbsp;The Bicultural Programme for Chinese spans the upper secondary to JC level and aims to groom a core&nbsp;of students with a confident grasp of Chinese Language and culture. This Programme&nbsp;enrols&nbsp;about 350 Singaporeans each year. In addition, we have&nbsp;the Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) which is also&nbsp;available at the \"A\" Levels, and this helps&nbsp;deepen students&rsquo; appreciation of Chinese Language and literature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2006</p> As I have said, if more students do well in Chinese and there is demand for SAP school places, MOE is willing to consider setting up one more SAP school.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member):&nbsp;</B> I want to thank the Minister for the reply.&nbsp; Since I left school 37 years ago, there have been various changes in the method of teaching Chinese.&nbsp; It looks like we are trying to stop the deterioration of the Chinese Language level amongst students.&nbsp; I have two questions.&nbsp; One is that besides considering a change in the&nbsp;teaching method, would the Ministry also consider improving the environment for learning Chinese?&nbsp; The second question is, would the Ministry try to highlight to the students the value of studying Chinese?</div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ng Eng Hen:&nbsp;</B> The answer to both the questions is yes, we do want to maintain the standard of Chinese Language but I think there is also a broader challenge and one which we monitored quite closely and this is the language speaking environment in homes and society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Language is aural-oral,&nbsp;which means that you have to listen and speak it to learn it. That is the basis for learning a language and as the speaking environment changes, I think we have to take that into consideration.&nbsp;We have given figures that 20 years ago, about one in 10 Chinese households used English at home, it is now six in 10, a six-fold jump, quite a dramatic jump.&nbsp; It is not only for Chinese-speaking households, the same effect is seen in Indian households, it has jumped from three in 10 to six in 10 and even for Malay households where it has jumped from 0.5 who use English as the dominant language to 3.5&nbsp;&ndash; nearly four in 10 Malay households use English as the predominant language.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not only at home but the time that they spend&nbsp;&ndash; their primary mode of <p align=left>Column: 2007</p>communication on the Net&nbsp;&ndash; we did a survey of what students were communicating and because they are messaging, communicating on the Net, the predominant language is English, the&nbsp; <I>lingua franca</I> of the Internet.&nbsp;So their exposure to that has increased.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;inextricably,&nbsp;the time exposed to any other language, whether it is Chinese, Malay or Indian, has come down and we are recognising this and we are trying to evolve our system to cater to a wider spread of ability, not only to help those who can manage to go as far as they can, to support the ones&nbsp;who are willing to take or can take the HCL but to also support those in the middle band as well as those who are weak and we think that we can do that by shifting our teaching methods to make it more relevant so that they indeed see the importance, as the Member has said, and we are trying to invite businessmen to come to schools to explain to them the importance, to even take them through certain aspects of Chinese history or Chinese culture or Chinese geography and I think that this needs to be a community's effort.&nbsp; I agree with the Member that it is more difficult because English has become more dominant but it is something that we wanted to do and MOE will study&nbsp;the details closely to see how we can do this, how we can support this but this will require the community's efforts as well.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:DROPOUT RATE AMONG ITE STUDENTS--><p align=left>Column: 2007<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:DROPOUT RATE AMONG ITE STUDENTS:::2012--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Latest data from ITE shows that 82% of the intake cohort from 2006 graduated from ITE with a full certificate.&nbsp; Of the 18% who left ITE prematurely, 69% obtained certification for at least one core module of study.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2006, a committee on ITE Student Success was formed to identify reasons for attrition as well as recommend measures to address these.&nbsp; The study showed that ITE students drop out for a variety of reasons: peer and family influence, lack of drive, not being able to cope with their studies, job opportunities, and personal or family issues.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, several recommendations have been implemented to address the different causes of attrition.&nbsp;These include firstly,&nbsp;introducing a flexible curriculum framework to cater to students with different needs, abilities and aspirations; secondly, expanding student counselling and services to provide holistic support for students; thirdly, enhancing the professional development of ITE lecturers to improve teaching effectiveness; and fourthly, instituting team-building programmes to foster camaraderie and peer support among students.&nbsp; ITE closely monitors and assists the weakest students by giving them additional remedial lessons and counselling.&nbsp;&nbsp; With time, many of these programmes and measures should yield a higher success rate for ITE students.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ITE will maintain the rigour of its courses to ensure acceptability by employers and will not lower standards in order&nbsp;to improve completion rates.&nbsp; ITE&rsquo;s current rate of non-completion is already among the lowest in the world for <p align=left>Column: 2009</p>vocational institutions.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it will continue its efforts to help as many students as possible complete their course.&nbsp; For those who leave prematurely or without full certificates, ITE will continue to provide avenues for them to return to complete their training.&nbsp; Based on survey findings from the committee&rsquo;s final report, more than half of the ITE students who leave early are, in fact, open to the prospect of re-enrolling sometime later.&nbsp; Assistance will also be given to help them pick up skills to be employable.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is almost like two out of 10 students drop out of ITE.&nbsp; There had been measures implemented but I would like to ask for an assessment as to how effective are these measures in addressing this dropout rate problem and also whether MOE is considering other measures to do two things: one, to help these students to remain in school, at least to further reduce the attrition rate because helping to keep them in the ITE is better than trying to help them after they have left; and secondly, whether there are other measures to assist them once they have left ITE, in particular, apart from just getting them back into ITE, whether there are other programmes,&nbsp;eg,&nbsp;bridging programmes, so that they can acquire skills that they can use to enter the workforce. Because at the time&nbsp;that they dropped out, they were too young to make use of the adult training programmes that were available.</div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Iswaran:&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for her questions.&nbsp; I think we should be very clear. Our basic strategy for this group of students must be for them to enrol and stay in ITE for the full length of their course so that they <p align=left>Column: 2010</p>complete their education in ITE, acquire a marketable and recognised piece of qualification which will then hold them in good stead when they enter the workforce.&nbsp; So the predominant focus of our efforts must be channelled in this direction&nbsp;and, indeed, that is what has been happening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member says that 18% is high.&nbsp; It is relative, which is why I gave the comparison with international. In fact, when you compare internationally and across vocational institutions, our achievement is, in fact, quite remarkable and widely recognised as quite outstanding.&nbsp; But that does not mean that we cannot do more and, indeed, that was the objective of the review.&nbsp; The Member has outlined a range of ideas and possibilities to be undertaken and I think these are all embedded in my reply. If&nbsp;I can recap,&nbsp;for example, when you focus on counselling, peer group development, the idea is to create an environment within which the students will be able to develop greater rootedness in the ITE for the course because sometimes there are other considerations, like family and peer pressure and they need counter weighing factors. That is an important element and giving the lecturers the additional capability to also deal with this is an important factor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of skills acquisition, clearly if they finish their course and even if they do not finish everything, some of them, as I said, acquire certification in some core modules which is also quite helpful, I think that would be a big first step and what ITE is then doing is also facilitating re-entry because some may decide at a particular point in time that they want to discontinue for perhaps valid reasons but they would want to re-enter at another time when they recognise that they need skills upgrading and ITE is prepared to facilitate that as well&nbsp;so I think we have to look at this holistically.&nbsp; It is a bit too early I think to assess whether the more <p align=left>Column: 2011</p>recent set of measures are yielding dividends because it has been only couple of years but I think in the long run if you look at it, based on our historical track record, we have done quite well but we should continue to press ahead so that we can help the 18% or so who dropped out.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It <p align=left>Column: 2012</p>appears to me that ITEs now seem to operate&nbsp;like polytechnics and the polytechnics are now operating like the universities.&nbsp; I would like his comment on that.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Iswaran</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp; I am not sure why the Member has this impression.&nbsp;&nbsp;How is our ITE curriculum developed?&nbsp; It is developed not just by the ITE colleges coming together and coming&nbsp;up with a course or pedagogy methodology.&nbsp;It is one that is worked out in close collaboration with industry, so the industry's feedback is the key element.&nbsp; In securing industry feedback,&nbsp;we are trying to establish where our ITE graduates would go out and fit in in the broader workforce.&nbsp; That is how we have to calibrate it.&nbsp; Now, if there are changes in our ITE system, it is not because of an arbitrary increase in standards or a desire to move unilaterally in a particular direction.&nbsp; But it is largely given by the fact that ITE is responding to the needs in our market.&nbsp; The needs in our marketplace are changing and Members would agree that it changes quite dramatically in some instances.&nbsp; So it is important that our ITE curriculum is dynamic, is able to, not just offer a variety of courses but a&nbsp;variety of courses at a level which will command respect and currency in the labour market.&nbsp; And that is the objective of the exercise.&nbsp; I think the fact that over 80%&nbsp;are able to complete their full course, it suggests that calibration is about right.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien) (for the Minister for National Development):</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, within HDB flats, the responsibility lies primarily with the lessees. HDB will rectify defects in new flats during the one-year Defects Liability Period, similar to the industry practice for private residences.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the common property of HDB estates, Town Councils (TCs) are the primary parties responsible for their cleanliness, maintenance and upkeep.&nbsp; The TCs are empowered under the TCs Act to set up rules and regulations to manage and maintain common property in the HDB estates to cater to the local needs of residents. The TCs also have enforcement powers to ensure compliance through fines and penalties.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At&nbsp;the national level, public agencies have the powers of enforcement under the various statutory acts. They will step in to support TCs where public interest warrants such actions. This is especially relevant for instances where nationwide consistency is critical or where the consequences of non-compliance with rules are severe. For example, NEA works with TCs to prevent mosquito breeding and fight dengue in HDB estates due to its significant impact on public health. HDB, as landowner and lessor, also works closely with TCs in the fight against killer litter. For law and order issues, the Police may exercise its powers to prosecute offenders directly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng:</B> &nbsp; Thank you, Senior Minister of State for the reply.&nbsp; It appears to me that the response seems&nbsp;to point&nbsp;to Town Councils as being the main agency to&nbsp;handle&nbsp;most of the problems that arise in HDB estates.&nbsp; I am not quite <p align=left>Column: 2014</p>clear on the accountability of residents who need to support&nbsp;the Town Council&nbsp;in their work and also the different agencies.&nbsp; How do we prevent the Town Council officers, for example,&nbsp;from becoming the \"punching bags\" for anything that is not going right in the estate?&nbsp; The purpose of my question was really to have MND clarify the accountabilities of all the different stakeholders as we manage estates together to make sure that they become a better home for all of us.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien:</B> Thank you for the supplementary question.&nbsp; Before I answer the question raised by the Member, I would like to reiterate the purpose of having Town Councils.&nbsp; Town Councils were set up 20 years ago, principally to devolve decision making to the local level. This is to allow participation by the&nbsp;community in setting up rules and regulations that serve the need of local residents.&nbsp; For that purpose,&nbsp;we have allowed Town Councils some leeway in the rules and regulations as well as delegated the priorities and responsibilities of maintenance, cleanliness and so on to the Town Councils.&nbsp; How do we want to clarify the roles?&nbsp; I think communication with the residents is very important.&nbsp; We have stressed the need to develop that communication channel better.&nbsp; Recently, we have announced the Town Council reporting&nbsp;framework, primarily again, is to encourage that two-way dialogue and communication between Town Council and their residents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the roles of the other agencies, I think this is where other agencies and departments have played their respective roles.&nbsp; For example, when it comes to fighting mosquito breeding, NEA has taken a very active public position for public education on the Do's and Don'ts and it has also taken active actions to raise penalties, issue penalties&nbsp;as well as summons in the estates as well.&nbsp; So, as much as possible, understanding the purpose of Town Councils&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; Town <p align=left>Column: 2015</p>Councils rightly will be the main party responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of public housing estates but agencies recognise that there are areas where we need consistency across the estate where the consequences are important, whether is for law and order issue or otherwise and many other examples on that,&nbsp;where it has supported the Town Councils.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:</B>&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua, last question.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> &nbsp; Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.&nbsp; I am surprised that being Senior Minister of State&nbsp;of MND, she&nbsp;has brought up cases of NEA instead of HDB killer litter.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether she could consider, during the inspection for the Town Council Management Report (TCMR),&nbsp;asking the officers to advise the lessees of HDB flats on killer litter items that have been detected during their rounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, HDB has left this role to the Town Councils.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien:</B> &nbsp; Thank you for raising this issue on killer litter.&nbsp; This issue was debated comprehensively yesterday, so it is all right that we can discuss this again.&nbsp; We go back to the purpose of having Town Councils.&nbsp; It is really for local decision making process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Town Councils may decide to have certain rules and regulations that perhaps apply specifically to this town which may not be applicable to other towns.&nbsp; For that reason, how we want to manage killer litter in the specific location must be subjected to the local rules and regulations.&nbsp; It is only when is necessary that we will apply at national legislature.&nbsp; For example, someone who places objects precariously and&nbsp;causing hurt&nbsp;to the public, the public agencies would come in to regulate and to punish the culprit if necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in other instances, some Town Councils may decide to allow certain <p align=left>Column: 2016</p>plantings to be displayed at common corridors, void decks or in some areas in front of the blocks.&nbsp; So when that is the case, there must be some leeway for Town Councils to respond to the needs of the residents and, therefore, Town Councils will have the responsibility to also do its own enforcements and to issue the necessary penalties or summons according to the rules that they have set up themselves.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SALE OF UNITS AT SKYTERRACE AT DAWSON--><p align=left>Column: 2016<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:SALE OF UNITS AT SKYTERRACE AT DAWSON:::2019--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>SALE OF UNITS AT SKYTERRACE AT DAWSON</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

So we have built stand alone studio apartments and&nbsp;studio apartments next to the flats. But I think there is one common theme that cuts across these options&nbsp;and it is that we do not want to see isolation of the elderly.&nbsp;In the various forms of housing that we have provided, we make sure that there&nbsp;are integration,&nbsp;social and recreational facilities for inter-generational use&nbsp;&ndash; the elderly, the young and the adults.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to your third question, about whether there is any perception that young Singaporeans may not wish to stay near the elderly. My response would be that we would not want to see an enclave of elderly and elderly only. It will be part and parcel of every Singaporean resident staying in HDB estates, to see various income segment, age group as well as family background or career background, staying together. That, in a way, is&nbsp;the value of HDB estates that we see this real integration of different <p align=left>Column: 2019</p>segments of Singaporeans,&nbsp;regardless of&nbsp;age or income. And I think that Singaporeans have come to accept that as a part of HDB estate living.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ENHANCING SAFETY AT WORKPLACES--><p align=left>Column: 2019<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:ENHANCING SAFETY AT WORKPLACES:::2024--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>ENHANCING SAFETY AT WORKPLACES</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B> asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what more can be done to enhance safety at workplaces in view of the recent spate of workplace accidents; (b) whether the system of contracting and subcontracting which is widely practised in some industries has aggravated the problem; and (c) how effective is the whistle blowing mechanism in helping workers to raise the alarm on dangerous situations.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Manpower (Mr Gan Kim Yong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Manpower (Mr Gan Kim Yong):</B> Sir, since the launch of the new Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) framework in 2005, we have made progressive improvements in our WSH standards. But the spate of accidents we saw&nbsp;last year shows that there is still more to be done to ingrain its strong safety culture and improve safety and health standards at the workplace.&nbsp;For the first time since the launch of the new framework, we saw an increase in the workplace fatality rate. The workplace fatality rate was 2.9 per 100,000 workers last year, compared to the rate of 2.8 recorded in 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work at heights and crane lifting operations accounted for close to half (about 46%) of the 70 workplace fatalities last year.&nbsp;Apart from ongoing initiatives such as the Programme-based Engagement (ProBE) and regular dedicated WSH Forums, MOM and the WSH Council established the National Crane Safety Taskforce and the National Work-at-Height Taskforce last year to look deeper into better managing safety in these areas. Both taskforces are led by key industry leaders and comprise members from the relevant stakeholder groups, such as the industry and professional <p align=left>Column: 2020</p>associations, suppliers and training partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Crane Safety Taskforce announced some preliminary plans in September last year on enhancing training, extending outreach and the publication of technical guides. Last month, the National Work-at-Height Taskforce announced its recommendations, one of which is to implement Fall Protection Plans at all workplaces that require work at heights. MOM has also tightened up our enforcement efforts. Recently, the Ministry conducted an island-wide blitz named \"Operation Sky Hawk\" which focused on fall-from-height risks at smaller construction worksites.&nbsp;Six stop work orders and 179 fines and warnings were issued to 29 worksites during the blitz. At a broader level, MOM and the WSH Council are also developing sectoral plans for the construction and marine sectors to further enhance WSH management in these two sectors.&nbsp;The two sectors accounted for almost two-thirds (63%) of fatalities seen last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with Mdm Halimah that the system of contracting and subcontracting work, if poorly managed, poses a challenge to the proper management of safety and health at the workplace.&nbsp;Accidents can happen should contractors fail to exercise sufficient oversight to ensure that their sub-contractors comply with the safety rules and take adequate safety measures, or if&nbsp;various contractors at a worksite fail to coordinate their work properly.&nbsp;Where previously the Factories Act placed the burden on the occupier to manage WSH at the worksite, the WSH Act places obligations on stakeholders ranging from the occupier to principals and employees to ensure safety at work.&nbsp;Contractors and sub-contractors who fail to take adequate safety measures or fail to comply with the safety rules set by the main contractor will be held liable under the Act.&nbsp;Since the enactment of the WSH Act in 2006, we have prosecuted about <p align=left>Column: 2021</p>38 sub-contractors for failing to take adequate safety measures at work. In 17 of these cases, we also took the occupier to task for safety lapses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selecting the right contractors to work with is an important aspect of ensuring proper contractor management and co-ordination.&nbsp; The bizSAFE scheme, introduced in 2007 to help companies raise risk management capabilities, and also be used by contractors to select sub-contractors with proven capability to manage risk. Moving ahead, the WSH Council&rsquo;s Construction and Marine Committees&nbsp;&ndash; sectors where the system of contracting and subcontracting is especially common&nbsp;&ndash; will step up engagement efforts with stakeholders in the two sectors, including the sub-contractors, to build stronger ownership of WSH issues and outcomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah also asked whether the current whistle-blowing mechanism on safety issues has been effective. MOM receives valuable safety feedback provided by workers and members of the public through various touch points such as our hotlines. These touch points are widely publicised through worker collaterals, bus advertisements, at project information boards and banners at worksites. To further reinforce awareness of safety issues and workers&rsquo; rights, the WSH Council also conducts regular outreach programmes such as dormitory visits and roadshows.&nbsp; On average, the Ministry receives&nbsp;some 60 safety-related tip-offs a month, approximately 25% of which come from workers. Under the WSH Act, workers are protected from dismissal by the employers when they raise legitimate safety concerns to MOM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To bring about sustained improvements in our WSH outcomes, we need to go beyond awareness and capability building. We need to change mindsets and <p align=left>Column: 2022</p>build a safety culture in which every&nbsp;stakeholder&nbsp;&ndash; from the CEO to the worker on the ground, sees WSH as his personal responsibility. It is for this reason that under our new national blueprint for WSH&nbsp;&ndash; WSH 2018&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;we are placing greater focus on developing a progressive and pervasive safety culture. We want to nurture a culture where individuals recognise their responsibility in protecting not only their own health and safety, but that of others working with them. Ultimately, we want safety and health to become a way of life such that every worker naturally and routinely thinks about safety as they go about their work.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> I thank the Minister for the clarification. I have three follow-up questions which&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;to what extent is the large pool of foreign workers found in some sectors, particularly in sectors&nbsp;with a higher rate of accidents,&nbsp;a contributing factor for these accidents? My second question is this. There is a tendency for the smaller companies, because of a&nbsp;lack of capacity, resources or cost, to have&nbsp;a higher rate of accidents. What additional programmes will be put in place to assist them?&nbsp; Third question: although the WSH Act is only four years old, does it&nbsp;indicate that there are some gaps in the Act that need further fine tuning.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B> Sir, I would like to point out that we have to be careful in interpreting statistics. The fact is that many of the foreign workers are in sectors that naturally has higher risk, like marine and construction sectors. But on the other hand, the MOM has put a lot of emphasis on worker&nbsp;education, particularly for foreign workers. I mentioned earlier in my reply, that we conduct dormitory visits to the foreign workers, we educate and train them. We also provide brochures and even videos in their native languages, so they could understand what safety is about. We also ensure that employers and contractors work with us, to help train <p align=left>Column: 2023</p>and keep these workers up to date on safety issues. Whenever there is a safety incident, we will send circulars to our employers and sometimes to the workers, to the dormitories as well, to remind them and share with them some of the experiences that we have and, hopefully, we will help them to improve their safety outcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to smaller companies, in fact resource constraint is one issue, but that is no excuse for loss of lives. I think Members would all agree.&nbsp;Therefore, the Ministry has been working with many of the industry associations to reach out to the smaller companies to provide them with resources and support to help&nbsp;them improve their safety&nbsp;outcome.&nbsp;In fact we have also been working with the main contractors, which tend to be larger companies, working with them to reach out to their own sub-contractors. They understand that the safety outcome of their sub-contractors would affect their work and performance as well. If an accident happens&nbsp;at the worksite and stop work order has to be issued, it is not only the sub-contractor that will suffer, the main contractor will also have to suffer losses as a result of lost time. So I think many of the large contractors are aware.&nbsp; Shipyards, for example, we have been working with them very closely to reach out to their sub-contractors and these large contractors are performing like a mentor to train and help the smaller contractors to achieve desirable WSH outcome. I think we are working in&nbsp;that direction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the WSH Act, we also have to bear in mind that the Act alone, will not help us to achieve the desired outcome of WSH. The Act provides the framework and guidance to companies and workers on their respective responsibilities and to hold errant parties accountable for their actions. But ultimately, if you want to achieve the desired WSH standards, 1.8 fatality per <p align=left>Column: 2024</p>100,000 by 2018, that is the target that we have set. For us to achieve that, we need everybody to be involved. The Government will come out with rules, regulations, the industry associations and the Council will come out with guidelines and advisory, but it also takes every employer on the ground to do their part, and that is what we are trying to do through our WSH 2018 blueprint, to inculcate this culture of safety among all our workers and employers from managers all the way down to supervisors, workers down the line.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs):</B>&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;the Government does <p align=left>Column: 2031</p>not assign race to a person but follows the general rule that a child's race would follow that of his or her father. Nevertheless, recognising that the diversity of Singapore's racial demographics has increased in recent years due to the inflow of immigrants and the rise in the number of locals marrying foreigners, with effect from 2nd January this year, our birth registration forms were revised to provide for declaration by the parents on their child's race during birth registration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, such a child would be registered following the general rule as having the race of the father. The recent change gives parents who are of different races the flexibility and choice to decide how their child's race should be recorded. The Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) is not the authority or expert on \"race\". It will accept a race declaration so long as it falls within generally accepted notions of ethnicity by lineage.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, a Caucasian-Chinese couple may decide to have their child's race recorded as Caucasian, Chinese or Eurasian.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Singapore birth certificate gazetted under the Registration of Births and Death Rules does not require a child's race to be recorded. The child's race is recorded provisionally at birth registration in ICA's system until the child turns 15 and is required to register for an identity card. At this point in time, registration of the identity card will entail a registration of race declared and this will then be used to update the existing record of the individual in the ICA system. Changes of race declaration can also be made at any time by the parents or by the child himself when he is no longer a minor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the system, especially with the recent changes, already provides for an appropriate level of flexibility and choice to parents who are of different races. Ultimately, however, parents who are of different races should come to a decision as to which of their races they <p align=left>Column: 2032</p>would like their child to be recorded as belonging to.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I should declare my interest that my child has parents of mixed race.&nbsp; Will the Senior Minister of State clarify his answer?&nbsp; Will his Ministry allow parents of different races to reflect both races on their child's identity card?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B>&nbsp; Sir, the Government has considered this matter carefully and has decided to allow parents of different races reflect both their races as a double-barrelled race in a child's identity card.&nbsp; This is on top of existing expanded options of choosing only one of the two different races for the child.&nbsp; Some examples could be Indian-Chinese, Caucasian-Chinese or Malay-Indian.&nbsp; This policy change will be subject to certain rules. We all know that societal trends suggest that a child of a mixed-parentage tends to identify himself or herself more closely with one of the two races.&nbsp; So, for parents who prefer their child's race to be double-barrelled, they will have to decide the dominant racial identity for the child, and this will be put as the first of the two components of a double-barrelled race.&nbsp; Take the example of an Indian father and a Chinese mother, which I believe Mr Hri Kumar is of that category.&nbsp; The parents decide that Chinese will be the dominant racial identity for the child, the race will be Chinese-Indian.&nbsp; So Chinese becomes the dominant race which is&nbsp;reflected first.&nbsp; If&nbsp;the mixed-parentage parents have not decided on the race to be reflected but still prefer the child's race to be double-barrelled, ICA will reflect the race of the father first (Indian-Chinese) and that is when the parents do not make a choice.&nbsp; Of course, parents can still go with the default option of following the father's race, which is Indian, if they are undecided on which race to choose or follow the mother's race (Chinese), if they so decide and need not go for the double-barrelled race option.&nbsp; So, flexibility is now greater and there are&nbsp;more choices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2033</p>But let me just add that there is really no need for parents to rush to register the child's double-barrelled race classification at birth because even after that point in time, there will be other points in time when they can do that. Indeed, they can change the race classification.&nbsp; For children going to school, the natural point in time will be when they register for Primary One&nbsp;&ndash; I think we had a discussion here in the House&nbsp;&ndash; and, also, when they register for their identity card at age 15.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other caveat is that for practical reasons, this relaxation cannot be allowed to go on <I>ad infinitum</I>.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>I think Members will appreciate that.&nbsp; So if the child goes on to marry someone of another race or indeed of a mixed race, what happens is that when they have children, then they will have to choose which two of the three or four races to be declared as the child's race.&nbsp; Let me also say that the public should&nbsp;not rush because Government agencies will need time to make the necessary system changes to accept double-barrelled races.&nbsp; Once the changes are in place, ICA will allow such registration and we will announce the details in due course and when this new approach will be come into effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

But if this is a national wide feedback generating process, is the CRC going to convene more focus groups than just eight and, if so, what are the intervals between each focus group and would&nbsp;it go beyond just parents, youth and educators, perhaps going into the heartlands to see what the silent majority think about either broadening or tightening&nbsp;censorship?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For the focus groups, I think the eight groups have reached out to 150 people across industries, both the publishers as well as publishing industries, the arts groups and media but importantly also, of course, educators, parents and youth, as I <p align=left>Column: 2037</p>mentioned earlier.&nbsp;

Members will recall that in October 2007, we amended legislation to enable more women to qualify for maternity leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualifying period for maternity leave was shortened from 180 days to 90 days.&nbsp; Pregnant employees who are retrenched during the last trimester will&nbsp;receive maternity leave benefits, which they were not entitled to previously.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These changes were adopted after extensive consultation with both&nbsp;employers as well as&nbsp;the unions. Whilst we wanted to do more for women, our key consideration is how to do so without&nbsp;impairing the employability of women.&nbsp; If our proposals had resulted in higher business costs or significant operational difficulties, then it may have led to employers discriminating against all potential women employees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2038</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, we will continue to study proposals&nbsp;from Mr Seah as well as&nbsp;the public on how we can further increase&nbsp;our support for working women who are currently excluded from the statutory leave schemes in order to encourage more of them to have children.&nbsp;But whilst we do this, just bear that in mind that it does not inadvertently impair the employability of women.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But I would like the Ministries, both MCYS and MOM, to look into this further because I still want to question the basis of the policy.&nbsp; In my opinion, the common denominator is mothers rather than categories of mothers and that they all should be entitled to this benefit by the employers.&nbsp; I do not know how big is this group.&nbsp; But I am quite sure I have some residents who have come to me on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think for the three&nbsp;groups that are affected, it means and costs a lot to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also&nbsp;understand the considerations of employers, and we do not want to make things difficult for them,&nbsp;but at the same time, it is in the employers' interests also to take care of these three groups of expectant mothers.&nbsp;I hope the Minister could address that.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I give&nbsp;Members the assurance that I am doing my best to see how we can help this group of women, but just bear in mind that we must not inadvertently make it difficult for them to get the job in the first place.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government decided to develop the new Sports Hub through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mechanism.&nbsp; In this mechanism, the winning bidder would design, build and operate the entire facility over a period of 25 years.&nbsp; The Government in turn would&nbsp;pay the Consortium for operating the facilities and delivering services at contractually agreed standards through annual payments over the same period.&nbsp; The ultimate objective of using such a mechanism is to have a vibrant, compelling, financially viable and fully utilised public facility.&nbsp; In fact, this is currently the largest sports infrastructure PPP project in the world.&nbsp; I make these points because I want to emphasise that the contractual arrangements for these are&nbsp;very complex, and all parties to this contract must perform appropriate due diligence to protect their respective interests.&nbsp; Consequently, this is far more complicated than a standard Government procurement contract.&nbsp; It would have been far easier and far simpler&nbsp;to simply procure&nbsp;a new building.&nbsp; But this is not the way this contract is being structured.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically in the case of our Sports Hub,&nbsp;external events in the past two years have resulted in a delay in&nbsp;the conclusion of our contract negotiations. &nbsp;The steep rise in building materials and in <p align=left>Column: 2040</p>construction costs in the first half of 2008 required both&nbsp;us as well as the bidder to review the financial aspects of the construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;We had actually resolved this by the middle of 2008.&nbsp; Members will recall that we were then overtaken by the global financial crisis which led to&nbsp;a global squeeze on credit lines, not only in Singapore but indeed the world over.&nbsp; All the banks who had previously been happily queueing to extend credit to the consortium then became very reluctant to extend credit or even where they were, they would have extended credit at exorbitant interest rates which would, ultimately, have led to us paying more.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if we had proceeded hastily and blindly&nbsp;with the project despite such an unfavourable environment,&nbsp;we would have ended up paying a lot more for&nbsp;building materials and in interest costs. I therefore took the decision&nbsp;to adopt a more cautious approach and to wait for a more appropriate time to proceed.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government remains fully committed to the development of the new Sports Hub.&nbsp; In fact, now with the stabilisation of the global economy, stabilisation of construction costs and the gradual improvement in credit availability, we expect the project to get back on track in the coming months.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:</B>&nbsp; Question time is up, Dr Balakrishnan.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B>&nbsp; Just&nbsp;one last paragraph.&nbsp; The Consortium has recently launched a financing competition to raise bank financing for the project and there has been significant interest from the banks.

Our two casino operators intend to use <p align=left>Column: 2043</p>these too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Amending the definition of&nbsp;\"chips\" to include wagering vouchers will remove any ambiguity as to whether a casino patron may use such vouchers for gaming in the casinos.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 9 also removes references to goods and services tax (GST) in the specification of the entry levy under section 116 of the Casino Control Act.&nbsp; As the entry levy is regulatory in nature, no GST is chargeable on the entry levy.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, clause 9 also amends section 117(3) of the Casino Control Act to make it clear that entry levies, whether paid on time or recovered as a debt, should be payable to the Singapore Totalisator Board, and shall be used by that Board for public, social or charitable purposes in Singapore.&nbsp; The amendment addresses an anomaly between section 116(2) (where entry levies paid on time are paid to the Singapore Totalisator Board), and the current section 117(3) (where entry levies recovered as a civil debt are paid to the Government).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Clause 13)</I></p><p><I><br>&nbsp;</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, clause 13 makes various amendments to the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA) to enhance Singapore&rsquo;s anti-money laundering regime and bring Singapore into greater compliance with recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a body which sets international standards to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.&nbsp; Singapore has been a member of FATF since 1991.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, clause 13 amends sections 46(2) and 47(2) of the CDSA to make it clear that an offence is committed so long as the accused does the act knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the property represents another person&rsquo;s <p align=left>Column: 2044</p>proceeds of crime.&nbsp; The requirement to show that the accused had committed the act for the purpose of assisting the launderer to avoid prosecution for a drug trafficking or serious offence or the making or enforcement of a confiscation order is removed.&nbsp; Second, clause 13 amends sections 46(3) and 47(3) of the CDSA to make it clear that an offence is committed even if the accused acquires the property at fair value, if he does so knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the property represents the proceeds of crime of another person.&nbsp; Lastly, clause 13 amends section 48(2)(a) of the CDSA to criminalise the act of tipping off a person when the tipper knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect that a suspicious transaction report (STR) is being made under the Act.&nbsp; The current section 48(2)(a) only covers cases where the STR has already been made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to the Singapore Academy of Law Act (Clause 15)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another Act that is amended is the Singapore Academy of Law Act (SAL).&nbsp; Since 1997, the SAL has undertaken a stakeholding function and has built up the necessary infrastructure to provide a stakeholding service for properties in Singapore.&nbsp; Clause 15 expressly clarifies the SAL stakeholding function and the power to retain its income from stakeholding.&nbsp; As the&nbsp;SAL is now relying predominantly on its own revenue streams to fund its work and no longer relies on public donations, clause 15 removes the provision that deems the SAL to be an institution of a public character approved under the Charities Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to the Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act and Pensions Act (Clauses 2 and 3)</I></p><p><I><br>&nbsp;</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, clauses 2 and 3 remove terms in the Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act (MTERA) and the Pensions <p align=left>Column: 2045</p>Act that are no longer in use as a result of the restructuring of Government hospitals.&nbsp; All restructured hospitals now come under MOH Holdings Pte Ltd.&nbsp;For example, in the MTERA, terms such as \"Superintendent\" and \"Government hospital\", which are no longer applicable, will be replaced by the terms \"designated officer\" and \"approved hospital\" respectively.&nbsp; Another example is in the Pensions Act, where the phrase \"a male nurse at a Government mental hospital\" is no longer applicable and will be deleted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to the Competition Act (Clause 12)</I></p><p><I><br>&nbsp;</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, clause 12 amends section 69 of the Competition Act to empower the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) to charge interest on the instalment payment and late payment of financial penalties.&nbsp; This is to enable compliance with paragraphs 24 and 27 of the Government Instruction Manual section on \"Receipts\".&nbsp; Clause 12 also amends section 72(15) of the Competition Act to clarify that the Competition Appeal Board (CAB) has powers to order interest on any financial penalties that it imposes, confirms, or varies, which the CAB is already empowered under the Competition (Appeals) Regulations to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore Act 2009 (Clause 10)</I></p><p><I><br>&nbsp;</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 10 amends the definition of \"air navigation services\" under the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore Act (CAAS Act) to include \"communications, navigation and surveillance services\" to make it consistent with the International Civil Aviation Organisation definition.&nbsp; Clause 10 also amends section 52(2) of the CAAS Act to allow the Minister for Transport to make rules prescribing the methodology or other matters of determining the maximum prices for <p align=left>Column: 2046</p>aeronautical charges in addition to \"content, form and procedure\", which will provide greater clarity to the provision.&nbsp; Lastly, clause 10 corrects a typographical error in section 72(7) of the CAAS Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Other Miscellaneous Amendments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally Sir,&nbsp;a few amendments are proposed to facilitate better administration of various Acts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Act (Clause 8)</I></p><p><I><br>&nbsp;</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 8 amends the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Act (ACRA Act) to allow ACRA&rsquo;s legal officers to represent the Registrar, Deputy Registrars and Assistant Registrars of Limited Partnerships, who are ACRA officers appointed by the Minister for Finance under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008&nbsp;(LP Act) to administer the LP Act, in civil proceedings and other related matters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Employment Act (Clause 14)&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, clause 14 creates an offence for a breach of sections 88 and 89 of the Employment Act.&nbsp; This ensures that employers who are required to provide for paid holidays and sick leave under the Employment Act can be taken to task for failure to comply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to the Community Mediation Centres Act (Clause 11)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, clause 11 makes some \"house-keeping\" amendments to the Community Mediation Centres Act, namely, to correct cross-references to section numbers in corresponding legislations which have been amended.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><p align=left>Column: 2047</p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to zoom in on the changes made to the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The requirement that the act of concealing criminal proceeds be done for the purpose of avoiding prosecution is removed. This move is a positive one, because requiring the prosecution to prove motive for committing the act merely creates an additional and unnecessary hurdle before the offence is made out. If the accused knows that he is handling criminal proceeds, and takes steps to conceal them, he can hardly be said to be acting for legitimate reasons anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, there is no longer a requirement for an offence that criminal proceeds be acquired for no or inadequate payment. This effectively broadens the scope of the offence, making it easier for the innocent to be wrongly caught &ndash; but, at the same time, ensuring that those who acquire criminal proceeds knowingly are rightly convicted, even if they pay fair value for their acquisition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is also to be noted that the offence is made out even if the accused merely has reason to know that he is dealing in criminal proceeds &ndash; he does not need to actually know that he is dealing in criminal proceeds. This means that there is the possibility that one who does not actually know he is dealing in criminal proceeds, and pays fair value for the acquisition of the proceeds &ndash; one who has been duped by the criminal &ndash; can be convicted for this offence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, how will this affect Internet commerce?

In the original Act, the public prosecutor would require evidence that links the accused with the criminal act. In the proposed amendment, the public prosecutor needs only to show that the accused had reasonable grounds to believe that the&nbsp;money was tainted.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These proposed amendments changes the standards of prove in favour of the public prosecutor but I have no issue with this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Sir, first let me thank both Mdm Ho Geok Choo&nbsp;and Assoc. Prof. Paulin Straughan for speaking in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the removal of the requirement that the act of concealing criminal <p align=left>Column: 2049</p>proceeds be done for the purpose of avoiding prosecution, let me assure Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Straughan that even with the amendment, the prosecution still needs to prove that the accused had carried out some act of concealing, disguising, conversion or transferral of tainted property. In addition, the prosecution also needs to prove that the accused in committing the said acts knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that the money was another person's tainted property. In other words, the prosecution still needs to prove the existence of these two key elements which are known in criminal law. Lawyers amongst us will know it is&nbsp;<I>actus reus&nbsp;</I>(the act) and&nbsp; <I>mens rea</I> &nbsp;(the guilty intent).&nbsp;What is removed is the motive, that is, to show that the accused committed the acts for the purpose of assisting another person to avoid prosecution or the enforcement of a confiscation order.&nbsp;Indeed, as Mdm Ho has said, in fact, she hails this move as a positive one because as she puts it, to prove motive for committing the act creates an additional and unnecessary hurdle.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho is correct. As an analogy, I just put this forward to assure Assoc. Prof. Straughan, if a person receives or retains stolen property, knowing or believing that they are stolen property, he would have committed a crime already, under the Penal Code, for dishonestly receiving stolen property. There is no need for the prosecution to go further, to show that the accused committed the act for the purpose of helping the thief to avoid prosecution. Indeed, this amendment brings the affected provisions into full conformity, with Article 61A2 of the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime as well as Article 31B1 of the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in aquatic drugs and psychotropic substances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2050</p>Mdm Ho then makes a further point that the removal of the requirement where the acquisition of proceeds of crime are made for no or inadequate consideration broadens the scope and makes it easier for the innocent to be wrongly caught. But let me assure her that this is not the intent of the amendment. The essence of this amendment is to plug the gap where informed criminals may intentionally acquire proceeds of crime at fair value to escape prosecution. So, for example, if a person who is knowledgeable, such as an art connoisseur, pays market value for a stolen artwork, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the artwork was stolen, currently, he will be able to use the fact that he paid market value as a defence, even though he would have helped to launder the benefits of crime. So, conversely, an innocent person who acquires proceeds of crime without knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that it is from an illicit source, so be it through Internet commerce or as a pawn shop owner, or as a dealer in second hand goods, he will not be guilty of an offence. The onus, and this is&nbsp;a key point to bear in mind, is that the prosecution still has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the person knew, or had reasonable grounds to believe that these were proceeds of crime. These are the substantive points. Let me give those assurances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the procedural point, on section 46(5) and section 47(5), which Mdm Ho has pointed out, indeed, she is right that with these amendments, these two sub-sections have become otiose. But let me assure her that it will not affect the interpretation of the Act at all and&nbsp;will be removed at the next available opportunity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2051</p> The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;&ndash; [Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, last year in August, I informed this House that MHA was studying how to tackle this loanshark scourge more effectively. Setting out the various measures already in place, I said that we would tighten our laws to plug the gaps. Sir, this Bill is a result of&nbsp;our review. &nbsp;A key focus is to introduce powers that would disrupt the finances that sustain loanshark operations, hitting, in particular, loansharks in the higher echelons of the syndicates, where it matters most. It also introduces new measures to strengthen the existing legal regime. These include enhancing existing penalties and, specifically, criminalising acts that contribute to or advance loanshark activities in Singapore. And&nbsp;our laws' reach will also be extended beyond our borders.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, let me first set the problem in its proper context which is that the loanshark scourge is not unique in <p align=left>Column: 2052</p>Singapore. Indeed, it is a problem other countries face as well. In fact, loansharking is entrenched in countries such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and the UK, where the authorities, like us in Singapore, face stiff challenges in trying to eradicate it. How loanshark syndicates have evolved in other jurisdictions, including the use of violence, the cross-participation&nbsp;with other organised criminal activities like drug-trafficking,&nbsp;has convinced us that we must take tough actions to deal with this scourge before it grows to become a greater threat to our citizens&rsquo; safety.</p><p><br><I>Loansharking and related harassment reports continue to rise</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Measures proposed in this Bill will considerably strengthen the matrix of measures that MHA has progressively introduced since 2005. These include increasing penalties and cancelling passports. We also invoked the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act to detain loansharks against whom witnesses were afraid to come forward to openly testify. Despite these measures, loanshark activities persist. Except for a brief respite in the year 2007, when the number of loanshark and harassment cases dropped slightly, the number of reports has continued to rise, with 11,879 cases reported in 2008 and 18,645 cases reported last year.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On its part, Police&rsquo;s response has been emphatic and clear. The Criminal Investigation Department consolidated loansharking investigations island-wide under an Anti-Unlicensed Moneylending Taskforce in 2005 and reconstituted itself in 2008 into Specialised Crime Investigation Branches. Today, the CID works with designated teams in the Police land divisions to mount ground operations, whilst also conducting intelligence-led operations on its own. More CCTVs have been installed. Following my call last <p align=left>Column: 2053</p>August in this House for strong community action, the community responded very positively by forming Citizens-on-Patrol Teams and Neighourhood Watch Groups. And I know the grassroots advisers and Members here have also taken the lead in leading the communities. Civic-minded individuals including alert taxi drivers, ATM users and, indeed,&nbsp;newspapers deliverymen have all&nbsp;chipped in. The efforts of these grassroots leaders, watchful neighbours and active citizens have led to the arrests of a number of runners and harassers. The <I>Straits Times</I> reported in August last year that more than 180 Neighbourhood Watch Groups have been operating as Police&rsquo;s \"eyes and ears\" on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Community-Police collaboration has borne fruits.&nbsp;So, with the ground and Police working in tandem, even though the overall number of loanshark cases, year for year, has gone up, the&nbsp;number of loanshark and harassment cases on a quarter-to-quarter basis actually fell from 5,287 cases for the period April to June last year to 4,377 and 4,845 cases for the last two quarters respectively. The number of arrests have risen from 390 in 2007 to 505 in 2008 to 958 last year.&nbsp;So, this also means that we mean business and the Police working&nbsp;with the community are apprehending more loansharks and the runners. Indeed, the Police took down 13 syndicates last year, compared to the nine the year before. And these syndicates that were taken down were believed to be responsible for at least 3,800 harassment reports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, why are there more harassment reports? A key reason is that loansharks now increasingly target innocent neighbouring households by splashing paint on their doors, or on their cars in multi-storey carparks, hoping that peer pressure would force the borrowers to pay up. Indeed, in some instances, knowing that innocent parties are frustrated, loansharks demand <p align=left>Column: 2054</p>that they pay up on behalf of the actual debtors! These acts, though generally non-confrontational in nature and non-life threatening, nevertheless disrupt the community&rsquo;s sense of safety and well-being. Having said this, the Police is closely monitoring the dangerous tactics employed by some loansharks, not all, of locking people up in their homes or setting on fire items found outside their homes. If caught, these harassers will be punished with the full brunt of the law.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, our HDB estates are open and compact. They are particularly susceptible to the indiscriminate harassment gangsterism shown by loanshark syndicates. The large majority of harassment cases occur in our HDB heartlands where home-owners live in close proximity. Sometimes, even those living a level above or below the actual borrower&rsquo;s unit are hit. Although less than 1% of HDB households are harassed, every innocent household harassed is one too many.</p><p><br><I>Loansharks are organised criminal groups</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In August, I said that we needed to shift our paradigm as to how we view loanshark syndicates, that is, from unscrupulous moneylenders charging exorbitant interest rates to&nbsp;being a pernicious form of organised crime. Criminal acts perpetrated by organised criminal groups are a threat to society as they are tougher to eradicate and can create greater community impact.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me share some insights into how loanshark syndicates operate in Singapore. Today, technology gives us access to a global network of information and services. People are easily hooked up via social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Whilst connectivity through IT has many positive features, the flipside is that it enables criminal elements to perpetrate their crimes under&nbsp;a shroud of anonymity. Advances in communications technology and the ways money can <p align=left>Column: 2055</p>be transferred have led to loansharking syndicates and their operations becoming more extensive and sophisticated. Loansharking syndicates now exhibit characteristics of organised criminal groups and thrive on the profitability of the illicit business. These syndicates may either be one-person operations or, what is more likely, operations with multiple layers, typically with a \"<I>towkay</I>\" or \"financier\" who provides the capital, \"<I>ah longs</I> \" who operate the \"stalls\" which issue loans,&nbsp;typically through electronic banking transactions, and then, runners who commit acts of harassment and conduct other ground operations.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, loansharks have taken to outsourcing their \"business functions\" to debtors or youths, who appear easy targets for recruitment. These operatives carry out functions ranging from assisting the loansharks in the collection of money, to effecting transfers of money electronically, to carrying out acts of harassment. They add to the layers surrounding the loanshark syndicate, shielding the leaders from direct exposure. Members are also fearful to testify against the \"<I>ah longs</I>\" and \"<I>towkays</I> \" for fear of reprisal to themselves and their families. And business continuity is high as, characteristically, the syndicates&rsquo; structure enables them to elude Police enforcement, replace lower rung members, reorganise their resources and perpetuate their criminal activities.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loansharks also constantly evolve their <I>modus operandi</I> to elude detection and apprehension. For example, some leaders leverage on technology to direct their syndicates&rsquo; operations from overseas, making investigation and arrests even more difficult. With online tools becoming more sophisticated, we are likely to see a corresponding increase in the complexity and repertoire of technological options employed by these criminals. By their nature, loanshark harassment cases are not easy to solve. Unless the perpetrators are caught in the <p align=left>Column: 2056</p>act, there are often few leads that the Police can follow-up on. This is especially so in situations involving innocent victims of harassment who have no idea who the loansharks are.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As loanshark syndicates evolve their <I>modus operandi</I> to take on more characteristics of organised criminal groups, it is no longer sufficient to deal with loansharking as discrete acts of runners and harassers. We need measures that can cripple them, that is, disgorge them of their ill-gotten gains, choke the supply of funds and availability of foot soldiers, target the irresponsible borrowers and take loansharks out of the system for as long as we need to.&nbsp;Thus, this Bill allows us to deal with loanshark syndicates as criminal organisations, extend beyond the frontline to target financiers and masterminds, disrupt the flow of money and resources and ensure that syndicate leaders do not escape the bite of our laws by directing local operatives from the haven of other countries. To cripple the many layers of a loanshark syndicate, anyone who contributes to or facilitates a loansharking operation will attract the wrath of the law.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Wider enforcement powers &ndash; t</I><I>argeting the finances</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loanshark scourge persists because loansharks enjoy good profits. They charge exorbitant interest rates and recycle their ill gotten gains to fund more loans, thereby accruing even more profits. It is a vicious cycle. Besides arresting those higher up in the echelon, a key to effectively crippling the syndicates is to disrupt the criminal proceeds and the flow of money and resources that fund their activities.</p><p><br>&nbsp;<I>Framework to freeze proceeds of loansharking activities</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some syndicate leaders are dealt with under the&nbsp;Criminal Law (Temporary <p align=left>Column: 2057</p>Provisions) Act (CLTPA). Whilst we can invoke the CLTPA to detain them, we currently do not have the power to deal with their assets in the absence of a court conviction. So cases are dealt with under the CLTPA where witnesses are unwilling to give evidence in open court, either out of fear of reprisal or out of misguided loyalty.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, this Bill introduces a freezing framework specifically for loansharks dealt with under the CLTPA regime. Freezing their assets will hurt them where it matters most and disrupt the criminal proceeds that may otherwise continue to be circulated for loansharking purposes. Under this framework, the Minister is empowered to make an order to freeze a particular property or account held by any person when he has reasonable cause to believe that the property or any funds in the account are proceeds of the loansharking business associated with the detained loanshark. Such a freezing order is applicable to proceeds of loansharking in the form of cash, shares, bank accounts as well as physical assets such as houses and vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister may vary or revoke the order any time and it is an offence for a person to deal with any property specified under any order unless he does so under the authority of a licence granted by the Minister. Contravening or circumventing the order is&nbsp;an offence. The order will be revoked when the loanshark is no longer detained but will continue if he is put under police supervision upon release. Persons affected by the order can apply to the High Court to set aside the order.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as not to cause undue hardship to affected families, the framework provides a licensing procedure to enable certain acts to be exempted from the prohibition to deal with the frozen property.&nbsp;For <p align=left>Column: 2058</p>example, the licence can permit family members access to the frozen account. Conditions that may be imposed include requiring the person so licensed to account for the use of the funds or specify the amount to be released from the frozen account for use. The licence may be general or granted to a category of persons or to a particular person and the Minister can vary or revoke a licence any time. Failure to comply with any condition in the licence is an offence.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Powers to inspect bank documents and tax information</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Prosecutor will be empowered to require the Comptroller of Income Tax to furnish or produce information and documents available to the Comptroller relating to the affairs of a person, including the spouse, son or daughter, during investigations or proceedings against him for loansharking or related harassment activities. The Public Prosecutor will also be empowered to issue an order authorising the Police to inspect documents at a bank or finance company containing information of suspected loansharks as well as their spouses, sons, daughters, trustees and agents. With wider access to these records, investigators will be better able to follow the money trail and glean insights into a syndicate&rsquo;s network and the identity of its key members. These new powers will help unravel the syndicate network and, in the process, help secure evidence to implicate the financiers who operate behind the scene.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>&nbsp;Strengthening the legal regime &ndash; criminalising acts that contribute to loansharking activities</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, anyone who participates in loansharking operations contributes to the existence and continuity of loansharking activities. Every perpetrator, in supporting the organisation, perpetuates its illegal activities. In essence, when a person <p align=left>Column: 2059</p>assists or facilitates a loansharking operation, he becomes part of the many layers shielding the masterminds, allowing them to go undetected.&nbsp;More importantly, when he replaces a person who has been arrested, his doing so enables a loanshark syndicate to reorganise its resources and continue to thrive.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to target the many layers forming the organisation, anyone who contributes to or facilitates a loansharking operation, no matter what his role is, will not escape the wrath of the law. This will help us disrupt the syndicates. The Bill therefore amends section 14 (which is on unlicensed moneylending) and section 28 (on harassing borrowers besetting his residence) to treat certain acts as assistance of unlicensed moneylending and abetment of the harassment offence, respectively. These acts include, for example, selling pre-paid SIM cards to loansharks, transporting runners to harassment targets, acting as a lookout for harassment runs and assisting the loansharks in verifying harassment jobs before paying the runners. Indeed, a 27-year old ex-runner said that he was paid $10 for every address that he verified that harassment had been conducted. Sir, these acts are specifically chosen as they reflect the current <I>modus operandi</I> adopted in loanshark harassments. Persons carrying out these acts are deemed to have assisted or abetted loansharking offences and will be liable to the same penalties.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past three to&nbsp;four years, loansharks have been recruiting youths in their nefarious activities. Indeed, their numbers have increased. Last year, 154 youths aged 19 years and below were arrested for loanshark and related harassment activities, compared to 63 youths arrested the year before. Almost half of those arrested were students. In June last year, Police arrested nine loanshark runners, the youngest of whom <p align=left>Column: 2060</p>was only 12 years old. The exploitation of youths in the mistaken belief that if caught, they would either get away with it or face very minor penalties was earlier of great concern. But now the message is very clear as tough punishments have been meted out even to youths. To address the phenomenon of loansharks using youths to carry out loansharking or related harassment activities, the act of an adult causing or procuring a youth below 16 years of age to conduct such criminal activities will be made a specific offence under the&nbsp;Act. The adult instigator will be punished with imprisonment for up to&nbsp;nine years and also liable&nbsp;to a&nbsp;fine and up to 12 strokes of the cane if the youth carried out the loansharking or related harassment activities.</p><p><br><I>Tougher penalties&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it does not appear that syndicate members and their runners are deterred by the current penalties. Hence, we will enhance our punishments to send a strong message of zero tolerance for all loansharking activities. Mandatory imprisonment will be introduced for&nbsp;first time offenders who carry out or instigate harassment activities. Where the harasser does not cause any physical hurt or damage, caning will be introduced as an additional option to punish first-time offenders. In cases where hurt to persons or damage to property is caused, caning will not be an option, but a mandatory punishment, for first-time offenders. Loansharks who are first-time offenders will be punished with a fine and an imprisonment term which are now made mandatory, as well as caning as an additional sentencing option. Repeat offenders will be subjected to even tougher penalties. These enhanced penalties aim to deter those who are tempted by the profitability of loansharking businesses and, hopefully, also make our youths and debtors think twice before succumbing to the easy way out offered by loansharks. This deterrent <p align=left>Column: 2061</p>message forms an integral part of the overall solution in tackling the loanshark scourge.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Immunity for accused persons who assist the authorities</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, persons who participate in organised criminal activities typically adhere to a code of silence. When arrested, many refuse to cooperate with the Police, preferring to go quietly to jail. Police faces an uphill task&nbsp;in getting these syndicate members and runners to cooperate with investigations, because they fear their kingpins more than they fear the law. As such, enforcing the law against organised criminal groups will be greatly assisted when evidence and testimony provided by the co-accused&nbsp;is forthcoming. Hence, similar to section 35 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Courts will be empowered to require a co-accused to provide evidence for the prosecution, issuing a certificate of indemnity to him if he does this. The evidence of a co-accused will be useful in obtaining information on the loansharking syndicates and securing successful convictions of loansharks.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Extra-territorial jurisdiction</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to reach beyond the frontline and target the syndicate leaders. Some try to remain out of our reach by instructing local operatives from the haven of other countries. Loansharks who carry out, from other countries, unlicensed moneylending and related harassment activities in Singapore, should also be punished under our laws. Our Courts will be empowered to try an offence involving a loansharking business or which involves a victim in Singapore, even though the offence or part of the offence is committed outside Singapore. Through sharing of intelligence, our Police has maintained a good working relationship with its counterparts in neighbouring <p align=left>Column: 2062</p>countries. Building on these networks, Police will collaborate with these counterparts to deal with perpetrators who are hiding overseas.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Addressing the demand side</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, whilst focusing primarily on the supply side, we are also aware of key issues on the demand side. Top of this is whether we should make borrowing from loansharks an offence. Since I first shared that MHA was looking at this issue some two years ago, we have received quite a lot of feedback on it. The views are mixed. Some argue that whilst many borrowers turn to loansharks because of gambling debts, there are also those who do so because of a genuine financial need such as a sudden unexpected bill to pay. Others point out that criminalising borrowing may drive the loansharking problem deeper underground, deterring borrowers from reporting instances of harassment to Police and, worse, from coming forward to seek help. This, in turn, may embolden loansharks to employ even more dangerous tactics against the borrowers. Sir, it is for these reasons that we have not proceeded to do this at this point in time but we will monitor the effects of the measures introduced in this Bill before reassessing our options.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever it is, those who borrow from loansharks should understand and count the costs of borrowing from loansharks. Not only are they affected, their family and loved ones are affected as well. Owing loanshark money causes a great mental and emotional strain that can lead to dire consequences, as&nbsp;we all know. Whilst there is no excuse or sympathy for those who borrow from loansharks to feed their gambling habit, we do, however, empathise with those who face an unplanned, temporary and short-term financial squeeze. Sir, I urge people with a genuine financial need not to be tempted to take what they perceive as the easy <p align=left>Column: 2063</p>way out by borrowing from loansharks. Instead, they should tap other channels &ndash; community-based ones, commercially-driven ones as well as grassroots-related ones&nbsp;&ndash; for help. Family members, relatives and friends can also lend a helping hand to help these unfortunate ones tide over their temporary financial squeeze.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><I>Tightening the change of residence regime</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on criminalising actions of borrowers, for now, we will specifically target one group of errant borrowers and&nbsp;these are borrowers who deliberately provide outdated addresses in their NRICs or use false addresses to mislead loansharks into harassing innocent households. To protect these innocent victims, we will make it an offence for a borrower to provide false contact information to a loanshark which results in harassment activities being committed against an innocent person. Offenders are liable to be punished with imprisonment for up to a year.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, currently, home owners need only seek HDB&rsquo;s approval when they sublet their whole flats. HDB intends to also require HDB home owners to register the particulars of their subtenants when they rent out rooms. This will make it harder for borrowers to remain untraceable when they rent a room in a HDB flat. In tandem with the new HDB initiative, the National Registration Act and Immigration Act will&nbsp;be amended to empower ICA to obtain information from HDB to enable it to more effectively administer and enforce the requirement to report addresses or a change of address. Hopefully, this will facilitate the tracing of those borrowers who move from place to place to avoid the loansharks but, in the process, cause innocent new home owners or subtenants to be harassed.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In November 2008, I moved amendments in this House to modernise and streamline our licensed moneylending <p align=left>Column: 2064</p>regime, setting it on a more stable footing. As at end of last year, there were 218 licensed moneylenders, up from 173 at the end of 2008.&nbsp;Between March and September last year, which represents a seven-month period since these amendments came into effect, licensed moneylenders granted over $3.8 million&nbsp;in more than 1,700&nbsp;loans to borrowers earning less than $20,000 per annum. This works out to almost 250 loans per month. These are all small loans where the amount is capped at $3,000, with the interest rate also capped at 18% per annum. Indeed, in the event of unexpected emergencies, such as defraying medical costs or meeting business exigencies, these low-income borrowers can borrow more than $3,000.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Besides licensed moneylenders, low-income borrowers are also able to obtain loans from licensed pawnshops which do not impose any minimum income requirement. As at November last year, there were 138 pawnbrokers, up from 114 at the end of 2008. In addition, there are Community Development Councils, constituency grassroots organisations, ethnic-based organisations like the CDAC, Sinda and Mendaki as well as member-based Thrift and Loan societies that those in need of financial assistance can turn to.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me conclude.&nbsp; In conclusion, let me say that this Bill is not a panacea or magic bullet to eradicate the loanshark problem. But, hopefully,&nbsp;the measures will&nbsp;dent the intensity of loansharking activities. As I had explained earlier, unlicensed moneylending and loanshark harassment cases are not easy to solve. It is also not possible to fully anticipate new tactics loansharks will adopt. In short, the problem will not go away but Police will do its best to detect and punish all those who are involved in loansharking.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As always, I end the Second Reading speech by calling on everyone to press on resolutely. Continuing with our multi-pronged approach where the Police, <p align=left>Column: 2065</p>relevant Government agencies, grassroots organisations, social support groups and other VWOs, parents,&nbsp;teachers,&nbsp;and I think all of us&nbsp;have a&nbsp;stake in helping to stem this tide.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is crucial that we pull together to tackle this scourge effectively.&nbsp;Let me say that, on its part, MHA will continue to actively monitor the evolving situation and&nbsp;the Police will come down hard on all loansharks regardless of what they do in the syndicate. In this context, Sir, I can say that this Bill&rsquo;s key effect will be to make it that much harder for loansharks to perpetrate their clandestine operations in Singapore.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.47 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the&nbsp;Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loansharks are a menace to society.&nbsp;They have no scruples.&nbsp; They prey on the weak and the desperate for money.&nbsp;They exploit the young to do their dirty work for them.&nbsp;Their chief weapons are intimidation, shame and violence.&nbsp;They think nothing of harassing and destroying the property, not only of their debtors but their innocent neighbours.&nbsp;They will vandalise houses even when the debtor is no longer living there, thus proving that not only are they nasty, they are also not very clever. Indeed, to call them sharks, I say&nbsp;is an insult to those&nbsp;creatures of the ocean.&nbsp;May I suggest cockroaches instead?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore support amendments which will give the Police more teeth to rout this growing menace. From January to September 2009, there were 13,771&nbsp;complaints, compared&nbsp;to 11,789 for the whole of 2008 and the figure was even lower&nbsp;for 2007.&nbsp;So this is a growing <p align=left>Column: 2066</p>problem.&nbsp;We obviously need greater deterrents.&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore support increasing the punishment for carrying out or assisting in the carrying out of illegal moneylending activities.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as we all know, the real culprits are the kingpins and not the riff raff who do the running for them.&nbsp;For every runner we arrest, another takes his place.&nbsp;I therefore welcome the new measures to deal with the procurement of minors to carry out illegal&nbsp;activities. Likewise, the new power to freeze funds that the Police believe to be related to loansharking activities. By this, we can hit the syndicates where it&nbsp;hurts the most. To trace and uncover the funds, however, will be difficult but it is certainly worth trying.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may however cause hardship to innocent individuals and family members who depend on them. Could the Senior Minister of State therefore assure this House that this weapon will only be deployed in clear cases, and that where funds are frozen, the Police will expedite their investigations to minimise prejudice?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there have been calls to prosecute borrowers as well &ndash; to attack the demand&nbsp;to get rid of the supply.&nbsp;I have no doubt that some Members of the House will repeat this call.&nbsp;I hope we do not go that way, at least not for the time being.&nbsp; As an argument, it has logic.&nbsp;As a policy, less so.&nbsp;Most people do not go to illegal moneylenders and pay those blood-sucking rates because they want to.&nbsp;They are desperate.&nbsp; Borrowing from banks and other licensed institutions is reserved for those who are creditworthy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The typical customer of an illegal moneylender is not. His need for money may, however, be no less real or compelling than the next person.&nbsp;Not everyone has family or friends he can turn to for help.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, regardless of the reasons behind the borrowing, criminalising borrowing would have little deterrent effect on individuals who are <p align=left>Column: 2067</p>desperate. It would only serve to compound their problems and, worse, those who depend on them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is not to say that borrowers should be let off the hook.&nbsp; This Bill aims to criminalise provision of false information to illegal moneylenders.&nbsp;This is a good step forward as it punishes those who take loans and leave innocent third parties to face the despicable recovery methods.&nbsp;We should throw the book at them.&nbsp; But even this does not go far enough.&nbsp;How do we deal with those who provide correct information but subsequently change their place of residence?&nbsp;The problem is the same and yet they get&nbsp;away scot-free.&nbsp;They move out, fully aware of the problems they will be saddling&nbsp;future occupants with.&nbsp;The authorities would have details of these individuals and where they have moved to. There must be some way to make them accountable. Can they, for example, not be made responsible to make good the damages caused by the moneylenders?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need to help those who buy over flats from debtors and who may therefore unwittingly inherit the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the HDB not require the seller and the occupants to furnish a statutory declaration that they are not indebted to illegal moneylenders?&nbsp;If the seller comes clean or opts not to declare, the buyer can then decide with full knowledge whether he wants to proceed with the purchase.&nbsp;If the seller is eager to sell his flat, he will have the incentive to settle the debt.&nbsp;If the seller lies on oath, he can be prosecuted for making a false statement.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments are a good step in the mission to rid us of this illegal moneylending scourge.&nbsp;We can be sure, however, that the kingpins will try to find new ways to entrench and extend their business and keep one step ahead of the law.&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State has said that he will monitor how these changes <p align=left>Column: 2068</p>have effect on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;I, however, urge the Ministry not to wait to see how these new steps work before introducing other measures.&nbsp;You see, the thing about cockroaches is that just when you think you have stamped them out, they tend to spring back to life.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Er Lee Bee Wah:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I stand in support of the amendments made to the Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loansharking is a vice that strangles far too many innocent victims. In lieu of our upcoming casino launches, it is an absolute necessity that we suppress illegal moneylending and its accompanying myriad of social problems with harsher penalties before these issues escalate to unmanageable levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior Minister of State Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Ho Peng Kee hit the nail on the head when he pointed out that penalties are practical when they are targeted at loan sharks' bank accounts. After all, the moneylending business is all about making profit. However, it is precisely this aggressive pursuit for ill-gotten gains that I fear may spur these loansharks to persist with their activities in spite of the increased risks of getting prosecuted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Casinos are gold mines for loansharks. With the opening of two new casinos in Singapore, loansharks are likely to jump at the lucrative opportunity of baiting more borrowers trying to gamble their way to prosperity. To avoid run-ins with the law, they may bring their activities underground, find ways and means to get around the law and hire easily manipulated runners to cover their track. It is difficult to put a complete stop to loansharking activities as long as demand for easy loan exists. Innocent youths and school children&nbsp;now remain favourite targets as loanshark runners. The gullibility of these youngsters would enable the unscrupulous moneylenders to manipulate them just as the gangsters of <p align=left>Column: 2069</p>yesteryears took advantage of their young egos and turned them into street gangs to do their bidding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask that the Government put in place even stronger measures to prevent impressionable youths from being recruited as runners. These youths are easy preys because some of them may fall for the money, the challenge and the daring-do ego to become runners.&nbsp; These measures should go beyond tougher laws and punishment and venture towards identifying the root of the problem&nbsp;&ndash; why these youths are easy baits for loansharks. A recent media report gave some reasons from the viewpoints of youth loanshark runners. Broken homes and poor financial situations are not the main stimulants for delinquency as frequently assumed. Common reasons cited by these youths include peer pressure, boredom, money to satisfy material needs and paying off debts accumulated from online gambling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The online gambling undoubtedly poses greatest cause for concern, but allow me to first present some general solutions for these troubled youths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents and family members need to pay attention to their children's activities and their circle of friends. Teachers are already shouldering heavy responsibilities, but as schools have been noted as places where students get recruited into syndicates through friends, teachers, too, should keep a look out on suspicious behaviour and send students for counselling if required and alert their parents. As such, we need to look into developing more training programmes for school counsellors and volunteers in youth homes to counsel youths with such issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Largely populated and costly youth hangouts, such as arcades and night <p align=left>Column: 2070</p>spots, are common places where loansharks recruit runners. Law enforcement teams may consider including such locations in operations for scouting out loanshark activities. I sense that the Police should put more resources on intelligence gathering of these groups of people.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that more youngsters are getting addicted to online gambling is in itself an alarming occurrence. If they do not curb their gambling addiction, they will become social burdens to society, resorting to criminal activity to get money to feed their gambling needs, as some of them are already doing so by becoming runners for loansharks. We know that there is no end to the means to get illegal money and before long drug trafficking and organised crime would become part of their routine. We need to help these youths kick their gambling habits by designing specific educational and counselling programmes targeted at youths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Government to do more to help these innocent and impressionable youths to get their lives back together after being arrested. Help for them should not merely cease at apprehending them for their crime.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With no more income source, perhaps no more friends and a poor education level considering that some of them may be drop-outs or expelled from school, they are likely to go back down the slippery road. These youths should be re-integrated into school and counselled on the consequences of their actions. In the long run, this will be more effective in steering them away from delinquency and crime. They are young and they still have a long way to go.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of youths nabbed for activities related to illegal moneylending and laundering has been on the rise over the past few years, from 12 in 2006 to 94 in October last year. This distressingly <p align=left>Column: 2071</p>sharp increase is a strong indication that the involvement of youths and students in loansharking activities demands our attention. I hope my appeal for these youths to be given the opportunity to continue with their studies, to be given more&nbsp;counselling programmes and resources dedicated to this problem area will meet with your approval.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case of the moneylending syndicate members, I think we should consider their crime as sufficient to consider meting out caning for the kingpins as well as detention without trial. After all they too are like drug dealers who prey on the weaknesses of their victims.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp;

Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you&nbsp;for allowing me to speak on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has my fullest support.&nbsp; The loansharks have done&nbsp;much harm to Singapore.&nbsp; They have vandalised&nbsp;common property.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have terrorised not only the borrowers but also innocent parties, such as neighbours of borrowers or buyers of the targeted properties.&nbsp; When innocent parties are targeted and when these blatant perpetrators seem to be very hard to bring to book, then the residents'&nbsp;sense of security takes a hard knock.&nbsp; These loansharks also mar&nbsp;and undermine Singapore's hard-earned reputation of being a low-crime city and country,&nbsp;which <p align=left>Column: 2072</p>is very essential for our social and economic attractiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;The terror tactics of loansharks have gone too far, for&nbsp;too long.&nbsp; It is time for us to take the fight to them and we must be bold in our measures.&nbsp; We must&nbsp;hit them hard.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, support the&nbsp;use of caning, on top of fines and jail sentences.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support the raising of the fines and jail term ranges.&nbsp; This will enable our courts to send a clear message to these loan sharks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our deepest disdain is, of course,&nbsp;for real loansharks with the money and who control the operation.&nbsp; They control themselves well and are hard to get at.&nbsp; But they are the source of the problem.&nbsp; If we cannot get at them effectively, they will have the means to spawn endless variety of tactics to&nbsp;further their objectives.&nbsp; As it is, they have innovated and expanded the pool of runners by having not only people they pay to work for them, but also borrowers to do that dirty work for them.&nbsp; We are tackling a Hydra.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new measures to freeze the proceeds of their loansharking activities will strengthen our hand against them.&nbsp; This will, hopefully, scorch the stumps of the Hydra's head with each loanshark syndicate that the Police are able to cripple, and curb their ability to regenerate and proliferate freely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from the real loansharks,&nbsp;or what the Senior Minister of State referred to as the <I>towkays,</I> two other groups of offenders deserve severe punishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the debtors who turn into loanshark runners.&nbsp; Even if they had turned runners for the loansharks because they cannot afford to pay their debts, this is no excuse for their acts of harassment and vandalism.&nbsp; If the loansharks see that the Government or the courts are lenient towards such people, or lenient towards certain profiles of such people such as if they are young, or old, or if they are&nbsp;female, then the loansharks will make more use of such&nbsp;kinds of people to be their runners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2073</p>We must, therefore, be resolute and make examples of those who are caught so that no one will not hold the mistaken view that they will be let off lightly.&nbsp; Those who harass innocent parties like the neighbours of presumed debtors deserve even heavier sentences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, debtors who borrow using other people's identities and addresses.&nbsp; Such people are indeed despicable.&nbsp; They deliberately want other people to take the pressure and punishment from the loansharks on their behalf.&nbsp; Their victims could, for example, be those who bought over their flats not knowing that the seller chose not to update his NRIC address and would use the old address to borrow from loansharks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore support the new section 28(3) which makes the providing of false contact information by borrowers an offence.&nbsp; Besides the jail term of up to 12 months that is proposed, I would also ask that the courts be given the additional option of caning, especially for those who are recalcitrant.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to seek clarifications regarding the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 28A&nbsp;&ndash; on Abetment&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;This section focuses on those who instruct others to commit an act, or who arranges transport or lookouts to support an act.&nbsp; I would suggest that those who knowingly assist in arranging and/or providing any kind of logistical support,&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;materials such as paint, chains, locks, glue, pig heads or incendiary materials which also come under the definition of abetment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 28B&nbsp;&ndash; It makes it an offence for someone above the age of 21&nbsp;to cause or procure someone below the age of six to commit an offence under the Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;I assume that the intent of the section is to deter the procuring of minors to commit an offence under this Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the case, then what happens if the offender is <p align=left>Column: 2074</p>less than 21 years old, for example, a&nbsp;19-year-old&nbsp;procuring a 15-year-old?&nbsp; We must not leave a gap for the loansharks to exploit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the related amendments to the Immigration Act and the National Registration Act that require the HDB to disclose relevant secret or confidential document or information to the authorised officer for purposes of this Act.&nbsp; If the intent of these amendments is to facilitate the intelligence collection pertaining to the whereabouts of loansharks or their operating locations, why limit&nbsp;these requirements only to the HDB?&nbsp; Should it not also include the legal owners of private residential, commercial&nbsp;or industrial properties?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;loansharks are a defiant&nbsp;lot and a menace&nbsp;to law and order and a threat&nbsp;to our people sense of security.&nbsp; We must deal with them firmly and cripple them.&nbsp; May these amendments give us the tools to do this faster and better.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Joscelin Yeo (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is disturbing to hear the number of incidents that occur every year.&nbsp; I have personally witnessed the disturbing and damaging effect that such activities have on the members of our society.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two friends of mine who have been working for about two years since graduating from university are about to get married and have recently purchased their new flat.&nbsp; This is a time that should be a joyous occasion for them as they are preparing to embark on the next phase of their lives together.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2075</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is disconcerting to see how people can spend large sums of their hard-earned savings to purchase a flat and even before their wedding date and&nbsp;any opportunity to enjoy their new flat, it has been vandalised on at least&nbsp;two occasions by loansharks who were, in fact, attempting to harass and intimidate the previous owners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 7 seeks to amend section 28 which increases the penalty for the harassment and intimidation of any borrower or surety, any&nbsp;family member of a borrower or surety, or other person.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 seeks to increase the penalties for the offence of unlicensed moneylending and to introduce new penalties for individuals who operate in like manner including imprisonment terms and even caning at the discretion of the court, while clause 5 seeks to insert a new Part to provide for the freezing of proceeds of unlicensed moneylending to prevent these from being used for unlicensed moneylending.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am glad to see that these proposed amendments address the seriousness of these illegal activities by increasing the penalties mete out to these offenders and by empowering the Minister to cripple the perpetuation of these activities by freezing the related assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of this, given the rise in the number of youths caught in loansharking activities, it is good that adults who involve youths under the age of 16 be subject to severe consequences to give them pause for thought before influencing our youths in such a negative manner and way of life.&nbsp; Those adults who influence our youths to be involved in their illegal activities are endangering and potentially destroying the lives of our future generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The youths at this age are at a pivotal stage of life where they are extremely susceptible to the appeal of the sense of acceptance and trust the loansharks provide through the <p align=left>Column: 2076</p>empowerment to carry out certain tasks and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, I find resonance with clause 8 which seeks to insert new sections, in particular, section 28B, which carries the liability of a jail term as well as a fine for those who cause or procure a minor to commit an offence by participating in their illegal activities.&nbsp; I believe that such steps are important in protecting our future generation from the negative influences of loansharks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The seriousness of these acts demand the adequate severity of the penalties that must be imposed.&nbsp;They must be brought to a place where they are prepared to sacrifice their own future before sacrificing the future of our next generation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these comments, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><p align=left>Column: 2077</p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loansharks are a scourge to our society and a bane of our existence. They intimidate innocent and helpless people and damage properties almost with impunity. For many of us here in this House, almost not a single week passes by without hearing stories of some families with paint thrown at their door steps or walls defaced with some profanities or calls for debts to be paid. For many, this form of harassment causes great stress and mental anguish. The harassment affects not only the families of the borrowers, but increasingly also their neighbours as well; as harassment&nbsp;is carried out on the premise that neighbours will help to put pressure on the family concerned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have amended the Moneylenders Act several times in recent years. Quite obviously, the frequency with which we are amending the Act suggests that the Government is paying much attention to the problem of illegal moneylending. The question is, will the amendments this time round go far enough to fix the rising menace of loansharking?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed the current round of amendment seeks to comprehensively tackle the problem, including among others, making it an offence for anyone to participate even indirectly in the activity, giving the authorities the wide ranging powers to freeze bank assets, and making it an offence to get a minor involved. While I am happy to see determined efforts by the Ministry to deal with this scourge, I am not sure if the Government could have gone further in the current revision. In this regard, I have some comments and observations to make.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, as with any business, stamping out the demand side of the equation will have a severe impact on the viability of the undertaking. Loansharks feed on the <p align=left>Column: 2078</p>demand of the people for credit. If a way can be found to substantially curtail the demand for such loans, there will be less incentive for loansharks to stay in business. The anticipation before the introduction of the present Bill was that the Government was going to make borrowing from loansharks an illegal and criminal act. The belief is that criminalising such acts will deter and discourage many from approaching loansharks as a convenient source of credit. Unfortunately, when the Bill was finally presented, this provision, to the surprise of many, was not included. I note the explanation of Senior Minister of State in not wanting to introduce such a provision at this time. Principally, the Government&nbsp;accepts that many people turn to loansharks out of genuine financial hardships.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;the circumstances, they should not be criminalised. While many may be sympathetic to the reason, that alone should not be sufficient to mitigate the act of encouraging loansharks in business. We&nbsp;should only make&nbsp;borrowing a criminal offence but leave it to the&nbsp;AG's office to determine&nbsp;prosecution&nbsp;policy in such cases, just as we do not necessarily make all killings murder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, together with the proposed criminalising of borrowing from loansharks, the Government should put in place a programme to&nbsp;vastly expand the number of licensed moneylenders in Singapore,&nbsp; which I note from the Senior Minister of State's speech, the Government has been doing. The problem that feeds the business of loansharks is that people who need money for the short term, and these are not necessarily people who cannot pay, do not often qualify for bank borrowings. Also the credit cooperatives that exist are often linked to labour unions and not everyone is a member of a labour union. Reforming and reorganising credit cooperatives to make credit facilities widely accessible to members of the public will give people a wider option of places they can turn to if <p align=left>Column: 2079</p>they are in need of cash in the short term and not just the loansharks alone.&nbsp; I am pleased to note that the Government has recently increased the number of the licensed moneylenders. &nbsp;I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State, whether he is satisfied as a consequence, credit would now be made&nbsp;easier to the people, who needs it without having to resort to loansharks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One question which has arisen is whether our Government should put a cap on the amount of interest that providers of consumer credit may charge for the borrowing. In many countries, the law puts a cap on the amount that may be charged on consumer credit. The idea presumably is to ensure that these people do not unduly take advantage of those who are vulnerable. Unfortunately, we do not appear to have such a restriction in our legislation. Perhaps this is something that we should consider&nbsp;in this House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, one big difference that this Bill makes is its attempt to extend its reach beyond our borders. One of the biggest challenges, as I see it, in combating illegal moneylending is dealing with loansharks outside Singapore. Unless these financiers are caught, prosecuting those who show up at the door steps of the borrowers will not stop others from stepping into their shoes. These financiers must be stopped. Currently in the present provisions of the Bill, the authorities are given the powers to freeze bank assets. This would include those who are indirectly involved as well. This ability is welcomed as it will hopefully dry up the source of funds that support such illegal activity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the principle of freezing assets is to be supported, the current legislation appears to apply only after the illegal operator is caught. I wonder whether the scope should be expanded to allow the Minister the powers to mandate banks to track a certain profile of accounts and <p align=left>Column: 2080</p>fund movement based on intelligence gathered from investigations. This would strengthen the initiative of the authorities and make it harder for these crooks to operate here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, since loansharks are increasingly operating outside our jurisdiction, we should strengthen our efforts and resolve to work more closely with our counterparts overseas to smash these syndicates. At the moment, I believe there is extensive sharing of police information and intelligence. If we could improve on our framework for repatriation of criminals while deepening further the extraterritorial reach of our&nbsp;legislation by making it an offence to operate money lending business here from overseas, it would be a major milestone indeed in our efforts to combat this problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I think more efforts can be put in by the Government through its public education and counselling programmes. At the moment, illegal moneylending operates very much on the fringe of society. People who are involved in money lending, whether as borrowers or runners, almost to a person, I am confident to say, have personal problems that require help. For the young runners, it may be that they are forced to such activities by circumstance. For many, they resort to borrowing from loansharks out of ignorance about how to manage their money or where to turn to for help. In all these instances, I believe that a Government funded dedicated helpline will make a great difference and would in many cases help to avert a potentially disastrous outcome. Of course it may be argued that there are general counselling helplines out there that the desperate can turn to for help. While I would agree that such services are available, I would argue that a separate and dedicated helpline manned by trained staff who specialise in financial counselling and debt management will give it a very different signature and profile than is presently the case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2081</p>We all agree that loansharking is a very serious social problem that must be dealt with in all urgency. Can we effectively deal with the problem? I believe we can, provided we are prepared to demonstrate the firm resolve and determination. In fighting this scourge, there can never be half measures. One indication of the dedication and commitment would be the relative percentage of the budget that is allocated to dealing with this problem. Are we committing enough resources to deal with this? Is the Minister&nbsp;prepared to pour more money into this?&nbsp; If&nbsp;he is, I am very confident that this problem with loansharks here in Singapore, or as my colleague would call it, the cockroaches in Singapore, can be overcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment to the Moneylenders Bill is necessary to check the growth of illegal moneylenders and the associated activities that have affected many innocent parties. These activities cannot be left unchallenged as they are significant ill-effects on the society and the law and order of the country.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many Members of the House had, over the last few years, cited experiences of residents in their wards, we just heard of a few today. Innocent parties, like older folks and young child who are at home in the day, bear the brunt&nbsp;of the loanshark runners when their homes are beset.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MHA reported that harassment activities has surged from 4,759 in the first half of 2008, to 9,395 for the same period in 2009. This is so even after the introduction of stiffer penalties and <p align=left>Column: 2082</p>invoking the Criminal Law (Temporary Provision) Act in 2005.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is worrying as MHA had pointed out is the evolving tactics that have terrorised many heartland families. A family in my division sold their flats after two years because of persistent harassments from loanshark runners. They moved in with their in-laws within the constituency to facilitate their children's schooling. They are unable to afford to purchase another flat in the area as the prices have moved up over the last few years. The loanshark harassments have indeed affected the family in many ways beyond terrifying the young and the old, but have also set the family back financially. They have used up&nbsp;one bite of the HDB loan cherry, they have to contend with resale levies and to have their growing children cramp into their in-laws' flat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another visit to the block, another frustrated family related how the loanshark runners had splashed paint through the open front door of their flat narrowly missing their young child's eyes as he sat in the living room watching the television. Apparently, the family and&nbsp;the loanshark runners know that the unit that was borrowing was actually five floors above their targeted unit, and that the borrowers had moved five years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the recent MPS, an exasperated uncle was in tears when he came to seek to appeal to the authorities who have in custody of his nephew to require his nephew to change his address. You see, his nephew whom he only sees on and off for about the last 10 years, has been borrowing from loansharks and the debts squats have been harassing and other family members, damaging property most of the time. His&nbsp;neighbours were empathetic but their empathy and understanding have worn&nbsp;thin and his once friendly neighbourhood of 20 years has now evolved into a tense environment for the last few years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2083</p> This is a move that has been anxiously awaited for, and will go a&nbsp;long way towards alleviating&nbsp;the suffering of those who have become victims of loansharking activities. I would have opened my speech with the reference to a timely and necessary amendment but left out timely in the opening. The amendments are significant and I am sure my colleagues and families who are being harassed will applaud the changes introduced. I would say that although the amendments have come a little late for some of the families I have cited earlier, late is better than later. I am also happy to hear from the Senior Minister of State that the Police are actively monitoring the situation.&nbsp; While&nbsp;I&nbsp;appreciate that monitoring because of operation reasons&nbsp;has to have a low signature, I think the victims and households could be kept informed of what the&nbsp;Police&nbsp;are doing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Town Council and property managers and contract workers as well as HDB would join the residents in welcoming the amendments. Mr Speaker, Sir, I think as significant as the changes are welcome, I am not certain that it will leave an indelible mark&nbsp;(pun intended) here, and definitely not a strong enough signal to loansharks and particularly the loanshark runners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Minister to consider a stiffer penalty than those proposed, specifically on section 14(1), the revised penalty for first time offenders, who are unlicensed moneylenders, is a mandatory imprisonment term of not exceeding four years and an optional&nbsp;caning of not exceeding&nbsp;six strokes. I would like to urge the Minister to consider invoking a minimum imprisonment term of two years not exceeding four years, and a mandatory caning of two strokes not exceeding six strokes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For repeat offenders, to invoke a minimum imprisonment of three years, not <p align=left>Column: 2084</p>exceeding seven years, a mandatory caning of three strokes not exceeding 12. On section 28(1) and (2), harassing borrower, besetting his residence, etc, the revised penalty of mandatory imprisonment not exceeding five years for first offenders, I would like to urge the Minister to consider invoking a minimum imprisonment of three years not exceeding five years, and a minimum caning of two strokes, whether there is property damage or a person is hurt.&nbsp; For repeat offenders, to invoke a minimum imprisonment term of four years not exceeding nine years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been successful in our war&nbsp;on drug abuse by sending a clear and definitive signal as&nbsp;the types of drugs and tactics and <I>modus operandi</I> changed, our drug enforcement officers have kept ahead most of the time of the criminals and the addicts. I feel that if we let unlicensed moneylenders and loanshark runners staring up the barrel with minimum punishments, I am certain that we can alleviate this increasing problem.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loansharking and thuggery goes hand in hand.&nbsp; The thuggish behaviour of loansharks in trying to recover their monies exists not just in the movies.&nbsp; In some instances, the thuggish acts of loanshark runners are not confined to just those of their debtors.&nbsp; Many times, the harassment acts include defacing public properties such as lamp-posts and common walls of HDB flats.&nbsp; This is an affront&nbsp;to law and order and brings to the community a feeling of being under siege.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must show that there is zero tolerance&nbsp;for hooliganism, thuggishness and gangsterism.&nbsp; Have we sent a strong enough signal with this amendment?&nbsp; Sir, I think we can.&nbsp; Let us not miss the opportunity to give the innocent parties a chance for some relief and a message to all unlicensed moneylenders and would-be illegal lenders and their runners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2085</p> As early as 1993 when Prof. Jayakumar moved an amendment to the Moneylenders Act, the then Commissioner of Police&nbsp;&nbsp;had also signalled the intent of the authorities that such illegal acts of vandalism and harassment will not be tolerated.&nbsp; In fact, Prof. Jayakumar informed the House that while the amendment to this Act was in process, the Police had told him that there was already a dampening effect on&nbsp;the scourge&nbsp;of illegal moneylending harassments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am happy with the inclusion of new section 28B (Offences involving minors below 16), and I join my fellow Members in applauding this.&nbsp; This has implications that include our efforts to reform wayward youth, our concern and care for youth at risks and&nbsp;the curbing of future serious crimes committed by such minors&nbsp;as they&nbsp;become more brazen by being involved as loanshark runners and activities like that of besetting residences.&nbsp; I am hopeful that this new section will reduce the pool of runners for the loansharks to prey on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also glad to hear that there will be a tightening of the Change of&nbsp;Residence Regime and this&nbsp; will definitely go some way in reducing the anguish and tension of residents,&nbsp;like the gentleman and others like him&nbsp;who came to my MPS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the amendments.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Calvin Cheng (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>4.47 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Calvin Cheng (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill.&nbsp; I rise in support of the amendments to this Bill.&nbsp; The media reports of the scourge of illegal loansharks increasingly plaguing innocent families is troubling .&nbsp;&nbsp;Like my hon. colleague&nbsp;Er Lee, I fear that with the imminent opening of the Integrated Resorts, this may worsen.<p align=left>Column: 2086</p> It is indeed an appropriate time for Parliament to make the penalties harsher for unscrupulous&nbsp; illegal moneylenders.&nbsp; However, I have three concerns concerning this Bill.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first pertains to the distinction between body corporates and individuals that runs throughout the proposed amendments. Ostensibly, body corporates face a lighter punishment than individuals, in the sense that the maximum punishment they face is a fine, albeit higher than individuals, whereas individuals now face a mandatory jail term, and even caning. This poses the question whether more savvy illegal moneylenders will get away with less, by incorporating a company before they make their illegal loans, whereas the less sophisticated ones who lend as individuals get heavier punishment. In a business analogy, the sophisticated moneylenders who run private limited companies have their legal liabilities protected by their body-corporates, whilst the more ignorant chaps who run sole-proprietorships feel the full force of the law. In order to plug this loophole, may I suggest that the directors of these body corporates, their employees and associates are also punished as individuals under the Act.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point concerns the mandatory jail terms that individuals face. Although a mandatory jail term serves as a much higher deterrent to possible offenders, it also ties the hands of judges during sentencing, especially when considering mitigating factors. Some of these mitigating factors may be strong; for example, it is not unheard of for people in debt to these loansharks to be forced into working for them. This is especially so, given the ruthlessness of these loansharks, if these people break the law in fear for their lives or the lives of their loved ones. Judges should be allowed to consider these factors when sentencing offenders and a mandatory jail sentence may be too harsh especially in <p align=left>Column: 2087</p>cases where the perpetrators offend under threat or fear for their lives. Will the Minister consider raising the jail terms whilst not making it mandatory? In this way, the deterrent is still increased, without restricting judges when considering mitigating factors.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Bill does not distinguish between illegal moneylenders and those acting on behalf of them. In layman parlance, it does not distinguish between the loansharks, the leaders and&nbsp;their runners.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State for his clear explanation for the rational behind this and I do understand that within these organisations, it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between the loansharks and their runners, especially with runners often being promoted to more senior positions in the organisation.&nbsp; In addition, these runners&nbsp;are the hands and legs of loansharks and by cutting them off, we reduce the ability&nbsp; of syndicates to operate. These are also the people who directly terrorise people.&nbsp; However, it is also true that these masterminds, who in the words of the hon. Mr Heng, spawn the evil beneath them. I hope that the Senior Minister of State can consider in future much stiffer punishment, especially lengthy jail terms for these leaders when they are caught.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than these points, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the&nbsp;Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>4.51 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> Sir, I welcome the harsher measures to crack down on loansharks. The loanshark menace has been an increasing scourge in our HDB heartlands.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our MPS, it is increasingly common to&nbsp;see desperate residents appealing for the Police to act against loansharks and their runners who have been spraying paint on their doors and harassing them, even though they were not the borrowers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2088</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some residents had to come back repeatedly to the MPS, as the Police had not taken any action despite their many reports to them.&nbsp; One example I can give is a resident who came to me.&nbsp; She faced harassment for over one-and-a-half years after moving into her new flat in Tampines, although she had never borrowed from loansharks.&nbsp; She believed that the debtor was the previous owner of the flat.&nbsp; She had reported the loanshark harassments to the police in June 2008, and again in December 2008 when there was no action taken. I wrote to the Police twice on her behalf.&nbsp; The latest was in July 2009.&nbsp; It took&nbsp;several appeals before we received a reply from the Police to say that it has stepped up patrol at this resident&rsquo;s block.&nbsp; During all these many months, however, the resident is still&nbsp;left wondering why the loanshark had not been tracked down and caught, even though she had given the loanshark&rsquo;s phone number to the Police.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like&nbsp;an assurance from the Minister, that with these tougher laws, there will also be a more robust and active response from the Police in cracking down on loansharks and their activities.&nbsp; The Police should take the&nbsp;complaints of the residents seriously&nbsp;and act on them and not just take down the reports with little concrete to follow up.&nbsp; It will leave us in a helpless position if all that is being done is for Police reports to be filed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, earlier on, our colleague, Mr Hri Kumar mentioned that the loansharks are more like cockroaches than loansharks in the way they behave, given their nature.&nbsp; So there is an important difference in this case because cockroaches do not breed fear among people generally, but sharks do.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you talk to residents who have been&nbsp;harassed by loansharks, they are fearful, they live in constant worry for their children and their own family.&nbsp; So I think it is important that when&nbsp;we treat the loansharks, we treat them as a menace, <p align=left>Column: 2089</p>they are evil&nbsp;&ndash; like&nbsp;Mr Heng Chee How mentioned&nbsp;&ndash; but it is important that we also bear in mind that we have to tackle the problem as the fear persists on the ground and as long as the fear persists, the trouble with the loansharks will persist.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to be tough on loansharks, their&nbsp;recruiters and runners.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we should also be tough on the root causes that fuel the demand for loansharks.&nbsp;&nbsp;From my discussions with social workers, I understand that many who turn to loansharks are gambling addicts. Increasingly, they also include youths who are addicted to betting on the Internet. They will be desperate for money as long as their addiction remains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they could not turn to loansharks, in their depths of anguish and desperation, they may be driven to other actions for money, such as crime&nbsp;&ndash; which could be&nbsp;mugging or robbery; for women, it could be prostitution; and&nbsp;for others, perhaps, even suicide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A social worker told me of a case involving a 16-year-old student who is addicted to Internet soccer betting. His gambling debts amounted to about $30,000. &nbsp;He told his parents he would commit suicide if he could not continue gambling online. His parents were desperate and worried.&nbsp;&nbsp;So they paid&nbsp;off&nbsp;his debts, and not only that, they also continued to finance the gambling of their son by giving him $200 to $300 to gamble every week.&nbsp; Not knowing&nbsp;what to do, they went to see a social worker.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were at the end of their tether&nbsp;&ndash; what to do with their son.&nbsp; Their son refused to seek help for his gambling addiction.&nbsp; The son refused to consider it as a problem.&nbsp; But, Sir, that is the problem.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bailing people out may be an easy solution&nbsp;but it has no effect on the habit.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2090</p>Such cases are worrying counsellors, who are seeing more young Singaporeans hooked on gambling online.&nbsp; Another social worker told me about a middle-aged taxi driver, also a gambling addict, who borrowed from 41 different loansharks to pay his gambling debts. 41! He just could not stop gambling. So he hopped from one loanshark to another.&nbsp; It is such addicts who feed the growing loanshark machine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if we want to tackle the problem of loansharks, we need to also tackle the problem of gambling addiction.&nbsp; Reverend Dr Edward Job, who runs One Hope Centre and the Christian Care Services centre, is among those who are convinced that&nbsp;this would help to diminish the loanshark business. I had a meeting with him to find out&nbsp;more about the problem and he told me that about 90% of those who come to him with loanshark problems are gambling addicts.&nbsp;&nbsp;He would help them negotiate with the loansharks on their debt repayment, on two conditions: firstly, they have to attend weekly support groups for their gambling addiction; secondly, they need to bring along their wife or a family member to these sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are those who borrow from loansharks because they have financial difficulties, but their numbers are not many. This is because, for those in financial difficulties and out of work, we do have a safety net, especially&nbsp;the Comcare.&nbsp;However, not all want to come for hand-outs or they do not qualify, especially if they need large amounts of money to the tunes of thousands.&nbsp; For some, it is a matter of maintaining a comfortable lifestyle. For others, it could be a desire to start a new business.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is where could they borrow such large sums of money, with a poor credit record.&nbsp; Given the present situation, I find it hard to agree with those <p align=left>Column: 2091</p>who call to criminalise borrowing from loansharks. If we criminalise acts of borrowing, we will only be adding to the pool of people with criminal records. This will not solve anything&nbsp;&ndash; indeed, we may well be aiding the work of loansharks for we know that many of the runners today are ex-convicts who could not find proper jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I urge the Government to take a more holistic approach to the problem, beyond tougher enforcement.&nbsp; They should include the following:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, an education programme about gambling addiction aimed at youths;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, regulate internet gambling to protect youths from compulsive gambling.&nbsp; Make it a requirement for licensed operators to block minors from gambling online;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, step up counselling and support for gambling addicts and their families;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, continued and improved support for ex-offenders to find jobs and to integrate them into the mainstream; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we should review our credit policies and schemes to ensure the availability of ready loans for cash-strapped individuals. We should encourage the growth of cooperative banks and micro-credit loan programmes to cater to the financial needs of the poorer segment of the population, which is now largely ignored by the existing large banks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only with all these pieces in the picture can loansharks be defanged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>4.59 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I express my firm support for this Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2092</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The measures are bold.&nbsp;&nbsp;They target the business owners, ie, the chief operators of illegal moneylending syndicates.&nbsp; So they target upstream but they also target the runners who&nbsp;indiscriminately harass borrowers and innocent residents who may not have even borrowed from them;&nbsp;therefore, targeting downstream.&nbsp; Before I go on to give reasons why I support the Bill and why I think the Bill could be further finetuned to add more robust regulation, I would like to say that my constituency, Ulu Pandan, and the grassroots leaders&nbsp;and the community partners there, will give our full support&nbsp;in carrying out the enforcement and having a community partnership to ensure that this activity is deterred in the constituency and it&nbsp;will be part of our Workplan Seminar next week.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular, I would like to express my support for the new section 28C, which makes it an offence for a person to provide false contact information of a borrower to an unlicensed moneylender.&nbsp;This is a step in the right direction and&nbsp;will go some way to protect innocent homeowners from harassment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Ms Indranee Rajah) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.01 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would like to express my support for the introduction of the new section 5(1A) which treats a loanshark who operates his business in Singapore from a location outside Singapore as having operated the business in Singapore.&nbsp; This is a far-sighted move with the long arm of the law to match. With the help of high technology and our online connectivity, more loanshark operators may operate their illegal moneylending activities here in Singapore while they remain physically beyond our jurisdiction.&nbsp; With this legislation, we will be able, among others, to request for such <p align=left>Column: 2093</p>operators to be extradited to Singapore once we track them down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the amendment of section 14(1), to increase the penalties for first time offenders from between $20,000 and $200,000 and imprisonment of up to two years, to between $30,000 and $300,000, and with imprisonment of up to&nbsp;four years, and possible caning of up to six strokes.&nbsp; I believe these measures are commensurate to the gravity of the offence and will help deter potential loansharks and runners from joining this illegal trade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of particular concern is the current practice by some loansharks to use students and minors to harass borrowers.&nbsp; Of the 136 youths caught in the period between October 2008 and September 2009, almost 50% were students. A new section 28B has been introduced, which makes it an offence to recruit a minor (under the age of 16) to commit an offence under section 14 which is unlicensed moneylending or section 28 which is harassment and intimidation.&nbsp; I believe this amendment will have significant impact and look forward to hearing an update from the Ministry on the reduction in the number of such young offenders in the near future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also fully support the introduction of the new Part IIA comprising new sections 15A to 15H which seek to deter the business of unlicensed moneylending.&nbsp; The provisions to freeze the assets of suspected loansharks will help to stall their operations and prevent them from expanding. &nbsp;Another significant amendment is the new section 32A which provides members of syndicate networks immunity from prosecution in exchange for information which will enable our law enforcement officers to track down other members of the syndicate, thereby providing a potent pool of prosecution <p align=left>Column: 2094</p>witnesses for prosecutorial and enforcement purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The illegal moneylending business is organised crime with a long history.&nbsp; To counter this deeply-rooted problem, we need a complete arsenal of weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;I n particular, I wish to highlight the following concerns about illegal money lending:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First,&nbsp;loanshark and harassment cases have gone up from 10,221 in 2006 to 11,789 in 2008.&nbsp; There were 13,771 cases from January to September in 2009.&nbsp; Information from counsellors suggests that more than 90% of those who turn to loansharks are gamblers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the problem will worsen with the opening of the two Integrated Resorts, coupled that with the problem of online gambling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, from conducting house visits in my constituency, I&nbsp; have first-hand experience that the whole corridor suffers when loansharks throw paint on doors and graffiti the walls and lifts. It dampens the mood, it depresses the mood.&nbsp; It creates&nbsp;an atmosphere of fear and depression.&nbsp;Can you imagine the effect on the children living next door? Why should innocent neighbours have to suffer?<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, as mentioned earlier, innocent residents have to bear the brunt of harassment if a false residential address is given.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have previously suggested in Parliament that the Ministry consider making the very act of borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders an offence.&nbsp; I have previously cited two pieces of legislation (the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Prevention of Corruption Act) as examples of effective legislation where the Government has tackled both the supply and demand side of the problem.&nbsp; It is under the Misuse of Drugs Act an offence to consume drugs, that is,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2095</p>demand and also to traffic drugs which is supply.&nbsp;While I support the measures in this particular Bill, which seek to reduce unlicensed moneylending by deterring the supply aspects of the offence, I urge the Ministry to give further consideration to making the very act of borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders an offence.&nbsp; This will enable the law to also contemporaneously, simultaneously&nbsp;deter the demand for unlicensed moneylending.&nbsp; Naturally, as Mr Sin has said, the Public Prosecutor will have the ultimate discretion whether to prosecute a borrower, and unique circumstances prompting a compassionate approach would likely merit non-prosecution. After all, there is nothing innocent about a borrower giving a false address to a loanshark knowing that an innocent household will be harassed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to quote an extract from&nbsp;a very good article dated 10th January 2010 by journalist Teh Joo Lin, to show the extent of how innocent parties suffer from the giving of false addresses by people who borrow from loansharks:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Step out of the lift on the 10th floor and you see a dozen notices in English and Chinese.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are plastered on the walls and ceiling of a corridor&nbsp;leading to a four-room flat in Sengkang.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One notice reads: 'Ex-owner ... has moved out ... for a year plus.&nbsp; Please stop disturbing us, thanks!'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the door of the flat, two electronic eyes scan both sides of the walkway, recording every moment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These 'fortifications' are the work of a young couple, the Ongs, who have been defending their first home against loan sharks since last July.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should innocent residents have to spend money, time and energy defending and protecting their homes?&nbsp; It is logical to <p align=left>Column: 2096</p>consider seriously and implement making an offence of borrowing from loansharks.&nbsp; Also, there is a possible counter-argument to that now, that if you give a false address, you&nbsp;can be prosecuted but that goes only so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;What if you do not give a false address?&nbsp; Why if you actually give your own address and the loansharks&nbsp;harass your neighbour?&nbsp; That borrower has not committed an offence yet his innocent neighbour or his neighbour five floors down, to use Mr Fong's example, are being harassed.&nbsp; So I think we need to seriously consider taking that bold step, if these measures do not seek to achieve the lowering of the&nbsp;numbers which are increasing from year to year.&nbsp; Therefore I support the amendments but seek the Minister&rsquo;s reply on my proposal which attempts to make the regulatory framework tighter and more effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, MHA, for the bold measures.&nbsp;I think they are indeed bold, they go upstream as well as downstream, contemporaneously but would the Minister consider going that further step if indeed the measures do not achieve the result that they are seeking to.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Audrey Wong Wai Yen (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Audrey Wong Wai Yen (Nominated Member):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join this debate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is quite clear from what has already been said in this House that this is a matter of great concern to everyone.&nbsp; All the anecdotes we have heard so far, you know, from residents whom MPs meet at the meet-the-people session to personal anecdotes of people we know who have had the flats being subject to paint splashes and so on, it shows that this is such a widespread problem.&nbsp; As such, I rise in support of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments to the Moneylenders Act does comprehensively tighten the laws on loansharking, which I have mentioned,&nbsp;is a growing problem. The proposed amendments will allow the <p align=left>Column: 2097</p>authorities to deal&nbsp;not just with the person who is running the business&nbsp;but his associates and all those&nbsp;who knowingly assist his business. The Bill spells out clearly that&nbsp;anyone who assists in this business, whether&nbsp;collecting payments on behalf of the loanshark, disposing of proceeds from these activities, allowing his premises to be used for this so-called business&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;acting as a lookout or runner and so on&nbsp;&ndash; will now be deemed an offender.&nbsp;In addition, I welcome the introduction of a new provision for the freezing of proceeds from illegal moneylending. Part IIA of section 15 which allows the authorities to comprehensively deal with offenders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the stricter laws, I am particularly heartened to see that the new section 28B offers protection to minors below 16 who are led to committing criminal acts on behalf of loansharks&nbsp;which can cause serious injury. Some young people&nbsp;may not be aware but what they do could actually cause injury or even death.&nbsp; More youngsters have been recruited to do the dirty business of loansharks such as setting fire to people's property or vandalising.&nbsp;These youths usually come from troubled families.&nbsp;They have poor school records and other difficulties in life; they deserve to be given&nbsp;guidance and not be led into a life of crime. Hopefully, the new section 28B will cause loansharks to think twice before recruiting these youngsters but,&nbsp;of course, I believe it would take more than just legislation to fully tackle this problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was intrigued to read another amendment in section 5, where a new subsection has been&nbsp;introduced; stating that \"a person who wholly or partly carries on, from a place outside Singapore, the business of moneylending in Singapore shall be taken to have carried on that business in Singapore\". I would like to query if there are foreign illegal <p align=left>Column: 2098</p>moneylenders operating in our midst, and if this amendment is&nbsp;being introduced in view of concerns of the&nbsp;opening of the Integrated Resorts where we can expect an international clientele patronising the casinos, and therefore&nbsp;possibly attracting foreign loanshark syndicates. I am sure we have all read stories and know of the stories about patrons of casinos in Genting and other places where they have been approached by moneylenders offering immediate loans right outside the casinos. These moneylenders could \"migrate\" to our shores and it is not unreasonable to assume that they too would want to globalise their business.&nbsp; It is undoubtedly easier with today's technology to internationalise all these illegal moneylending activities and as the Senior Minister of State has mentioned, such syndicates are also involved in other organised crime activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill also proposes a new amendment to section 15 of the Immigration Act which&nbsp;empowers immigration officers to request for information from the Housing and Development Board. This suggests to me that perhaps foreigners could be involved in this business, or are perhaps themselves also victims of loansharks in Singapore. And if they are foreigners, they may not know what to do or where to turn to for help if they are being victimised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would&nbsp;like to ask for a clarification of this amendment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I am in support of the stricter laws proposed in this Bill, I am also concerned that enforcement of these laws will also have a ripple effect on those who have been driven to borrow money from loansharks and have been victimised. One concern is that stricter laws will drive loanshark activities further underground, making it harder to track them down and deal with them if they continue to harass those who have borrowed&nbsp;from them and&nbsp;those who have borrowed may feel more <p align=left>Column: 2099</p>stigmatised and less willing to come forward to ask for&nbsp;help. People who resort to borrowing from these sources are often desperate, with little family support and nowhere&nbsp;to turn to and many of them also have gambling problems. In the financial downturn of the past year, it is not unreasonable to assume that many people might&nbsp;have found themselves in this perilous state, especially if they have been suddenly hit by large expenses such as medical bills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Government has assured Singaporeans that the poor and needy in our midst will be looked after, and&nbsp;have regularly enumerated the various programmes offered by the government agencies, CDCs, other organisations and charitable institutions, perhaps our current efforts to educate and reach out to the truly needy and desperate are still insufficient to help this minority of people who resort to borrowing from illegal means.&nbsp;As living costs continue to rise and the wages of the lowest-earning in our population may not&nbsp;keep pace with the inflation rate, I am concerned that we may see more financially desperate Singaporeans who may</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>still go to loansharks or work for them despite the risks.&nbsp; I would like to urge the MCYS, other state agencies and all the grassroots organisations to organise and promote more financial literacy programmes among those who need it the most and reach out and educate those who are so desperate that they are unable to see beyond their immediate crisis.&nbsp; Perhaps, there could also be more community level counselling programmes for those who have been forced to borrow from loansharks and their families to add to the efforts to curb the gambling problem in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that in the proposed legislation, the Act of borrowing from loansharks has not yet been made a criminal offence.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that by&nbsp;doing so, it would only punish those who are most genuinely in need and would also <p align=left>Column: 2100</p>simply drive these illegal activities further underground, making it deeper to really root them out.&nbsp; As for debtors&nbsp;who end up working&nbsp;for loansharks as runners&nbsp;and repeat offenders&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I know there are many repeat offenders who go to jail for loanshark activities&nbsp;and&nbsp;repeat their behaviour when they are out from jail&nbsp;&ndash; the new stricter laws may act as a deterrent&nbsp;but I believe the truly desperate would still continue to run the risk of the harsher punishment under these new laws and these only play into the hands of the loanshark syndicates.&nbsp; I would like to suggest again that all the relevant agencies and other grassroots organisations take action to rehabilitate these repeat offenders, so that they do not keep falling prey to the loansharks who might have been their former \"employers\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Illegal moneylending syndicates no doubt are causing social problems.&nbsp; Like most problems, they are probably best dealt with in a multi-pronged approach, with co-ordination and support from many different agencies, from the people and from and the State.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan:</B> &nbsp; Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker.&nbsp; I am going to just ditch my prepared speech because I have been learning from my fellow Parliamentarians.&nbsp; Before listening to them, I took a very academic approach.&nbsp; But I think that from the perspective of MPs who have to see the victims day to day and who have to answer to their constituents, they certainly bring a different perspective.&nbsp; Looking at the issue that this particular Bill is dealing with, I think there are two main concerns.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is the illegal activities of moneylenders, so that is supply.&nbsp; That would not have existed if there was no demand,&nbsp; and that is the borrower.&nbsp; So I <p align=left>Column: 2101</p>would like to indulge in talking about two points, Mdm Deputy Speaker.&nbsp; The first is on the notion of borrowing.&nbsp; Mr Christopher de Souza is my MP.&nbsp; He has very strong views about what we should do with borrowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to disagree with him not because I am a liberal sociologist but from a sociological perspective&nbsp;and&nbsp;for the past few hours, I have been sitting there and trying to understand what would drive a person to turn to a loanshark for money?&nbsp; It must be out of sheer desperation.&nbsp; And I learnt from my fellow MPs that from what little we know, the bulk of borrowers tend to be people who are in debt, who are gamblers.&nbsp; I would&nbsp;like to just&nbsp;take this&nbsp;opportunity to appeal to the Minister to do two things.&nbsp; First is to invest resources, to try to have a better appreciation of who this \"desperate group\" is.&nbsp; And if indeed they are primarily gamblers, even gamblers deserve our help.&nbsp; Therefore the second call would be to continue to look at ways in which somebody who is in desperate need of funds, to see if there is a legitimate source for them to turn to.&nbsp; Many in this category,&nbsp;I suspect, will not have a strong informal social support.&nbsp; So to say that they should turn to family and friends is pretty much telling them to go down a blind alley.&nbsp; So, as a society, I&nbsp;hope that we will continue to put effort into creating legitimate formal sources of help for the vulnerable group in our&nbsp;community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point that I would like to touch briefly on is the loansharks&nbsp;&ndash; the problem and the cause of frustration, trauma and unhappiness in our community.&nbsp; But in all the speeches that I have listened to this afternoon, I think the one blank spot that we have come up with is, no matter how stringent our laws are, at the end of the day, we may not get to the kingpins&nbsp;because we do not know how to find the \"big boys\".&nbsp; So instead, we starve them by cutting off the tentacles, the <p align=left>Column: 2102</p>runners.&nbsp; And the House has called for very stringent punishment on those who are engaged as runners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially when&nbsp;I had prepared my thoughts on this Bill, as some of you might have predicted, I called for a more compassionate approach.&nbsp; Many of these runners are teenagers and youths.&nbsp; They are not the direct source of the problem.&nbsp; But as I learnt more about the topic, I think that unless we can get to the core source, we have to do something.&nbsp; In this regard, I strongly support the Amendment spelt out in this Bill but&nbsp;I also like to impress on the Minister that in addition to this, we would put more effort into raising awareness among the youths and the school kids that being a part of this kind of&nbsp;illegal enterprise has very strong detrimental effects on innocent victims and to put greater effort into educating them so that no matter what the reasons are, for even thinking&nbsp;about engaging in such activities, they would be better informed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> &nbsp; Mdm&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill which I felt should have come sooner though I must admit it, it is better&nbsp;than never. I speak for the silent majority of HDB home owners who have suffered silently for too long as the illegal moneylenders and their henchmen committing the acts of hooliganism and vandalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to take a two-pronged approach to resolve this problem.&nbsp; The first approach is to harness the legislative powers to block the current rise in illegal moneylending activities.&nbsp; The other prong must be to look into the social aspects of the problem if we want to treat the disease and not just the symptoms.&nbsp; Let me first focus on the legislative changes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very pleased to see that we are going to throw the books at the kingpins and other hardcore henchmen by unleashing the powers of the Criminal<p align=left>Column: 2103</p> Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. I believe the Criminal Law Act was also imposed on the infamous <I>Chap Ji Ki</I> kingpins that caused their operations to collapse and the rest is history.&nbsp;&nbsp;The imminent opening of the Integrated Resorts underscored the need for us to be even more vigilant to the nefarious activities of the local syndicates, before they become more bold and jostle for a piece of the business at the casino tables.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the freezing of proceeds of unlicensed moneylending, I would like this to be extended to include the wealth of the syndicate family members so that any attempt to hide the ill-gotten gains will be ferreted.&nbsp; Instead of having to seek the Minister's sanction, I feel that a Senior Police Officer&nbsp;should be empowered to freeze the banking account of suspected moneylenders and their family members, while they are under investigation and there is a good reason to suspect their involvement in the illegal activities.&nbsp; The Minister's empowerment can be sought for long-term freezing of the assets, or for any appeal against the Police freezing of the assets, perhaps on good compassionate reason, if necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going through the enhanced penalties for the illegal moneylenders, I note that the caning is optional for these offenders.&nbsp; Why is this so? They are a scourge and a menace to society and I call for mandatory caning.&nbsp; My argument is that their illegal acts inject fear and often caused harm to so many innocent families, putting them in misery and anxiety.&nbsp; These loansharks and their henchmen destroyed the security and peace of the law-abiding community and as such should be given the rod, just like other criminals who inflict bodily harm.&nbsp; Hence, canning should be mandatory and not optional if we want to rid our society of this menace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For offenders who are a registered company, it is noted that the penalty is only a fine for the company. I feel the law should be tightened.&nbsp; After all, the <p align=left>Column: 2104</p>company can just go for liquidation and another new company can be easily set up.&nbsp; I seek to ask that the Minister amend the law to assume that the directors of the company are actually involved in the offence and sentence them as individual illegal money lenders. The penalty should include compulsory caning and not optional caning as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister if he could enlighten the House whether this offence is considered sufficiently grave to enlist the help of Interpol should the&nbsp;investigations warrant the need for external assistance to track down the culprits overseas and also the culprits' overseas assets?&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that the current optional penalty imposed under section 28 for harassment, will now be made mandatory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that we should make a strong impression on the would-be offenders that not only do they have to serve a mandatory fine and jail sentence, but they should be committed to perform community service for, say, 20 hours thereafter.&nbsp; These offenders should be made to perform tasks such as repainting of walls and railings in the HDB estates and other locations so that they get a taste of the hard work put in by the maintenance workforce.&nbsp; Let me give an extent of the damage that has been done in Aljunied Town Council estates.&nbsp; In 2008 and 2009, we see a total of 212 and 378 cases respectively.&nbsp; The total amount that was spent on the residential estates to rectify all the vandalism is $49,833 in 2208 and $69,370 in 2009.&nbsp; It is increasing all the time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second pronged approach is to see how we can eradicate this social illness.&nbsp; The root cause is the borrowing from illegal sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Ministry&nbsp;to consider this borrowing as an offence under the Act, as what out Member of Parliament, Mr Christopher de Souza, has said.&nbsp; This was earlier explained that this would bring the activities underground and the borrowers <p align=left>Column: 2105</p>keep silent&nbsp;on the details of the borrowing, hence investigative work is hard.&nbsp; Presently the situation is that we already need to change the legislature many times to get more information and I do not see the difference it will make.&nbsp; However, before we do, please do provide legal sources for mini loans for would-be borrowers.&nbsp; Today, we have pawn shops and various easy cash or Easi-Credit schemes but they all require the borrowers&nbsp;to show that they&nbsp;have the ability to pay unlike the illegal money lenders.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Government has combated the illegal 4-D by opening up legal 4-D betting shops, can the Government do the same&nbsp;by providing small loans to the people?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I would like to propose two&nbsp;possible sources where mini loans can be extended, one is for companies making small loans to employees and the other is for social clan associations to help these families in difficulty.&nbsp; Please allow me to elaborate.&nbsp; If companies are able to claim some tax incentives or reduce their risk of collection when small loans are made to employees in financial difficulty, the companies would be more willing to lend.&nbsp; For example, claim for tax incentives for a certain portion written off as staff expense upon non payment of the loans.&nbsp; The company has an interest in the staff welfare and the loan could easily be deducted from the employee's salary over a longer period of time.&nbsp; Secondly, most clan associations were set up to help each other when many of our forefathers came to this shore. The families are closely-knit and know each other well.&nbsp; If there are times of difficulties, they should be allowed to extend some credit to their members, as compared to now, where they are&nbsp;just social clubs.&nbsp; The Government could set a limit based on the funds that they have but&nbsp;allow them to provide some credit extending facilities to their members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2106</p>Illegal moneylending is not a problem that exists only in Singapore but is common in Asian countries and even in the West.&nbsp; In the UK for example, an estimated 200,000 UK households are using illegal moneylenders.&nbsp; People in the UK repay 120 million pounds&nbsp;per year to illegal money lenders.&nbsp; I would add to Prof. Straughan's call for a profile of the borrowers here.&nbsp; But&nbsp;the victims are most likely female, aged 30 to 40, on benefits, living in social housing.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Illegal moneylending is concentrated in deprived communities in society. Only a minority, three out of 10, of borrowers have chaotic lifestyles&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;drug and alcohol abuse or gambling problems. The rest have exhausted legal credit options.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should take a leaf from the UK experience and launch a Stop Loanshark Project. They have a&nbsp;website to offer debt advice and assistance for people who are in dire straits or who need counselling or assistance arising from harassment by these loansharks. They run training programmes for volunteers and for those who need help in money management. Retired police officers for example can volunteer their services and help to nail the culprits. There is also a Credit Action group which is a national money education charity&nbsp;established in 1994. Credit Action operates at a national level through advocacy, collaboration and partnerships with various groups and companies, with a particular emphasis on those most vulnerable to financial difficulties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, we should similarly set up a Stop the Loanshark movement. We can tap on the GRC websites to popularise its work and reach out to residents who can log in and report the culprits via e-mail or phone. The movement can be led by an experienced police investigator or any other civic leader, working with a pool of volunteers. We need to act fast, and act firmly to stem this scourge on our community. In <p align=left>Column: 2107</p>addition, this movement could also look into how to make our children money-savvy so that they do not fall into debts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, before I end, I would like to appeal for our young offenders who have been lured by loansharks into harassment activities and also opening of bank accounts for the illegal moneylenders. In view of the increase activities, our Home Team have moved in fast and furious and as a result our young offenders have been caught without knowing the serious consequences of the law. I have seen three young persons&rsquo; appeals in my Meet-the-People Sessions. Two teenagers are involved in harassment activities and the third is involved in the opening of a bank account for the illegal activities. Their family backgrounds are the same, namely, parents suddenly out of job, business failure and one parent suffered from sudden illness. Their allowances are either limited or suddenly cut off. They recognised their parents&rsquo; difficulties and did not press their parents for their daily allowances. As a result, either innocently or stupidly they allowed themselves to be coaxed into illegal moneylending activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to appeal to the Home Team to be sympathetic and compassionate to these young offenders and listen and understand the cause of their misdeeds. Allow them to have a chance to continue their education and impose on them the community service which I have advocated earlier on instead of imprisonment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have noted that the new section 28B applies to offences involving minors under 16 years of age. I am appealing for this to include the minors under 18 instead of 16. We have raised the age limit to 18 years for our young to take driving licence as we find that they are more responsible at age 18.&nbsp; We should raise the age limit to 18, so&nbsp;those who cause or procure any <p align=left>Column: 2108</p>person below the age of 18 years to commit an offence to be severely punished.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20100112/20100112VS_163154.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*</I>.]&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I am very glad that the Parliament will now legislate to deal with illegal moneylenders, who have been harassing others. I think we should learn from our experience of how we use the Criminal Law (Temporary Provision) Act to deal with the infamous <I>Chap Ji Ki</I> operators and cause their operations to collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, we can only nail down the shrimps and small fries. We have not heard of the big fish, maybe the \"soon hock\", or the red snapper being caught yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, with the freezing of unlicensed moneylender&rsquo;s account, I think we should extend it to include the wealth of family members of the syndicate, so as to stop the transfer of their ill-gotten gains. I also think that law enforcers should be empowered to freeze the bank account of the suspected moneylenders and their family members directly. Of course, their family members can appeal to the Minister to withdraw some of the money from the frozen account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also noted that caning is only optional, and not mandatory.&nbsp; Why is it so? I think we should make it mandatory, because illegal moneylending is already an offence. It is a criminal offence.&nbsp; They have also caused hardship to a lot of families and instigated a lot of young people to do this sort of things. I think we should make this mandatory, and not just an optional punishment.&nbsp; In addition, will these offences be serious enough to warrant the assistance of Interpol to help us to track down some of the illegal moneylenders and their assets?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays, people can apply for credit loans or credit cards. However, before <p align=left>Column: 2109</p>they are given the loan, they would be asked whether they have the means to pay. Illegal moneylenders do not require all these. As the Government has set up legal betting shops to fight illegal 4D, can the Government do the same by providing small loans to the people?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to propose that the Government work with the private and public sectors to extend mini-loans to the needy people. I think there are two ways we can do it: first, we would allow the companies to lend money to their employees; and secondly, we should allow the clan associations to extend loans to families who are in need. Please allow me to elaborate. If we could allow these companies to have some tax rebates to minimise the risk of bad debts, they would be more willing to provide small loans.&nbsp; In case this loan is not paid, it can be written off as staff expenses. The company can treat this as part of the staff welfare, and it could deduct the loans from the staff&rsquo;s monthly salary. Secondly, the original purpose of setting up clan associations is to foster relationship among clansmen and help each other.&nbsp; Now they are just a social club. I think we should extend their functions by allowing them to provide loans to families who are in need. The Government can set a limit based on the size of their fund.&nbsp; They could then lend the money to the members who are in urgent need.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to appeal for young offenders who have been lured recently by the loansharks into harassment activities and opening of bank accounts for the illegal moneylenders. In view of the increase in these activities, the Police have moved in very fast. As a result, many of the young offenders have been caught without knowing the serious consequences of the law. I have seen three young people in my Meet-the-People <p align=left>Column: 2110</p>session. Two of them were involved in harassment activities and were arrested. The third was involved in the opening of a bank account for these illegal activities. The family backgrounds are more or less the same, namely, parents suddenly out of a job, business failure, or one parent falling sick suddenly. Their allowances were either limited or suddenly cut off. They recognised their parents' difficulties and did not press their parents for their daily allowances. As a result, either innocently or stupidly, they allowed themselves to be coaxed into illegal moneylending activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to appeal on behalf of these young people.&nbsp; I hope that the Ministry of Home Affairs would be sympathetic and compassionate to these young offenders and understand the cause of their misdeeds. Please allow them to have a chance to continue their education and impose community service on them, rather than sending them to jail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I noted that the new section 28(B) applies to offences involving minors under 16 years of age. I am appealing for this to be raised to the age of 18. We have raised the age limit to 18 years for our young to take driving test, as we find that they are more responsible at this age. We should raise the age limit to 18. Anyone who lures a person below the age of 18 to commit an offence should be severely punished.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 2165-2168.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</B> A clarification, I believe.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza:</B> Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker, it is very short.

Even if we were to make borrowing an offence, there would be some compassion in the manner in which the discretion is used as to who would be eventually prosecuted.&nbsp; That is the first point. And secondly, if you do make borrowing an offence and the borrower is a young offender, you always have the ability to request that he be&nbsp;put on probation.&nbsp; Then, he can understand the full effects of what he has done and part of his probation could be going&nbsp;and scrubbing off &nbsp;\"owe-money-pay-money\" signs along the corridors.&nbsp; So I think that couples compassion with rehabilitation which is absent if you do not have it as an offence. But I would like to underscore my strong support for the Bill. I am not advocating that we go for making borrowing an offence now.&nbsp; It is only if the measures do not bring the numbers down.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seah Kian Peng:</B> &nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, my points on this Bill are motivated by the simple idea that money should be put in the hands of people who have the best ideas for them. Laws regulating money, in so far as money is treated as capital and hence a factor of production, should be merely tools that facilitate the most efficient allocation of this capital.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing wrong or bad about moneylending.&nbsp; In fact, I know of one very distinguished person who shared with me that his mother raised the family up by resorting to borrowing monies from loansharks. Fortunately, she was able to service the interest regularly and ultimately repay the loan amount in full. He confided in me that at that point in time, this was her and their family&rsquo;s only option.&nbsp; Unfortunately, such stories are few and far between and most people who had to resort to loansharks never get to see the light of day.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I see the proposed amendments to the Moneylenders Bill as a re-balancing of the <p align=left>Column: 2112</p>existing law, but I feel this balance can still be tilted towards the side of the lenders.&nbsp; Let me explain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we legislate for new measures and tougher penalties against loansharks and their associates&nbsp;&ndash; a move which I fully support&nbsp;&ndash; we need to, at the same time, review and propose measures which ensure that those in need know where they can turn to in their time of need. This issue, like most of the social problems we face now, has multiple dimensions to it. Someone describe it to me, it is like squeezing a balloon. As we turn off the tap and put&nbsp;the screws on the loansharks, we have to ensure that the licensed moneylenders become a known source which those in need of funds can turn to and borrow from.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members are of the view that there is a need to even impose penalties and make borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders, the loansharks, illegal.&nbsp;I do not support such a view as this in itself is not a solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So first, I support the loosening of controls on marketing as well as the charging of interest rates. The original Moneylenders Act (MLA) of 1959, was intended to protect borrowers from falling into the trap of moneylenders who impose high interest rates. But there is a sense that high rates are fair play.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The new Moneylenders Bill will make it&nbsp;legal to charge interest above the current prescribed amounts of 18% for unsecured loans, and 12% for secured ones.&nbsp; I support this because it allows a better matching of risk and return. Whether or not this will assist in profiteering is something that we have to find out empirically, but given the current status of information flows and means of communication, I find it difficult to believe that profiteering can still take place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, this new law will give licensed moneylenders more <p align=left>Column: 2113</p>flexibility to act and to increase the supply of money. At the same time, there is an affected area of law that may need to be changed in tandem with this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I speak of the credit co-operatives, a point on which Mr Sin Boon Ann has also elaborated. Whilst this does not come directly under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs, I would like the Minister to work with the appropriate Ministries to consider the promotion of credit cooperatives and some relaxation of rules that apply to them which may currently curtail their growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Co-operatives play a crucial role in this because they have a social mission, something that allows them to take on greater risks for comparatively lesser returns.&nbsp; For example, credit co-ops can serve the lower and lower middle income groups while the banks and&nbsp;finance companies can&nbsp;concentrate on the middle and the&nbsp;higher income earners. There may be some overlap but I think each will find its own space in time to come. &nbsp;In terms of marketing, co-ops will need to position themselves differently from moneylenders.&nbsp; And I believe they can do so &ndash; in the same way that many of the&nbsp;NTUC Social Enterprises, the various co-ops, they have differentiated&nbsp;themselves from commercial entities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stress the social mission because I do recognise that some families&nbsp;do need to have access to credit in times of crisis, and we need to look for solutions for such cases.&nbsp; So perhaps we need to make it easier, whether it is in terms of form filling, or whether it is in terms of greater expediency in processing of applications. We should certainly also encourage people to join thrift and loan societies, inculcate in them the&nbsp;concept of regular savings, in whatever small amounts they can afford.&nbsp; By being members, they will also have <p align=left>Column: 2114</p>access to loans when they need one because they are members.&nbsp; I would like to ask if the&nbsp;Minister can liberalise the existing restrictions to allow credit co-operatives to:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) advertise their services&nbsp;&ndash; the current guidelines do not quite&nbsp;permit them to&nbsp;advertise beyond the registered location.&nbsp; This, to me, does not seem to be&nbsp;very sensible because credit co-operatives cannot be location-based services.&nbsp; Members need to know that they can get help from their own co-ops and&nbsp;even if they are working in the same organisation, it is common for them to be spread over different locations; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) allow for greater flexibility in membership criteria so that they can reach out to more people in the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I recognise these proposals do not come under MHA's purview but I hope this can be taken up by the relevant Ministries, via the Whole of Government approach.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed legislative changes are of no use, I emphasise again &ndash;&nbsp;no use if we do not provide alternative options for traditional clients of loansharks to turn to and credit co-ops have a useful role in this regard. &nbsp;We are not encouraging such behaviour as irresponsible spending, but really, if you need to dig yourself out of a hole, I think it is to&nbsp;use a more friendly hand than a grasping one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I do support the need to punish illegal moneylenders severely. Despite what I have said about the advantages of the free market, I recognise its limits. The difference between loansharking and licensed moneylending lies in the licence.&nbsp; And the licence pledges a person to a certain set of rules, and part of which includes the proper behaviour of collection.&nbsp; Many&nbsp;of us have seen many residents affected and <p align=left>Column: 2115</p>traumatised by the collection tactics of debt collectors.&nbsp; I have my fair share of such residents who have been affected by these incidents.&nbsp; Their lives have been turned upside down.&nbsp; So I have no sympathy for such perpetrators and support the move for stiffer penalties. I&nbsp;want to propose some practical suggestions on the ground for the Minister to consider.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on the policing front,&nbsp;can we&nbsp;equip all NPCs (Neighbourhood Police Centres) with adequate CCTVs. This can be deployed immediately to affected victims as a form of monitoring.&nbsp; It is money well spent and should be made standard items in all NPCs.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, introduce incentive schemes for information relating to such activities and syndicates.&nbsp; It could be&nbsp;a one-off period as part of a clean-up exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, publish the photos of known loansharks and their syndicates&nbsp;&ndash; and this can be displayed on&nbsp;all notice boards of all Residents Committees&nbsp;and HDB blocks. If the Senior Minister of State needs a pilot run&nbsp;to test the effectiveness, I volunteer my ward at Braddell Heights to try it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, it needs a community effect to reduce loansharking. We need to recognise that there is a demand for credit from people who do not have good credit risks profiles; we need to match this demand to an honourable supply.&nbsp;I believe the new law is going towards that step.&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask to do it more and I would like to ask the Minister to consider the suggestions I have made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>5.51 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;it is timely that MHA is reviewing the law in this area taking into cognisance that harassment activities <p align=left>Column: 2116</p>have almost doubled in the first half of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.&nbsp; I am pleased to note that the proposed amendments to the law intend to adopt a multi-prong strategy of targeting not just the runners but the loanshark syndicate bosses, and even borrowers to deal with the burgeoning illegal moneylending problem in Singapore.&nbsp; This is indeed timely and imperative considering that the two Integrated Resorts will be opening&nbsp;their doors soon.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an MP, I always feel so helpless when I receive complaints from my constituents about harassment, vandalism and various forms of mischief, affecting innocent households, often with young children and elderly at home, who were not even borrowers or remotely related to the borrowers of these illegal moneylenders.&nbsp; I am, therefore, heartened that MHA is introducing tougher measures and stiffer penalties such as mandatory caning and incarceration even for first-time offenders to serve as deterrence to would be and repeat offenders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same vein, it is heartening to see the harsher penalties have been given more teeth with wider investigative and enforcement powers vested in the law enforcement agencies and most notably, the introduction of extra-territorial jurisdiction against illegal moneylending offenders.&nbsp; MHA has also gone the extra mile to criminalise the acts that contribute to loanshark activities and tightening the change of residence regime.&nbsp; Borrowers may also now be brought to court if they give false addresses that lead to innocent people being harassed by loansharks and their runners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this Amendment Bill becomes law, I hope to see the augmented powers exercised judiciously.&nbsp; In particular, I look forward to see the law enforcement agencies taking proactive action against these offenders to bring the masterminds, <p align=left>Column: 2117</p>the&nbsp;kingpins and the&nbsp;financiers behind these loanshark syndicates to answer for their illegal actions, and vindicate the humiliation, unnecessary sufferings and damages inflicted upon&nbsp;innocent households.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the problem of loansharking is that there is both the demand and supply side of it.&nbsp; Besides introducing new laws to arrest the problem it would be timely to also review the existing credit policies and offer acceptable and workable alternatives to cash-strapped individuals who genuinely need monies for unexpected exigencies. Such exigencies do not occur only in severe economic downturns or recessionary periods but also in good times when the economy is doing well as there will always be individuals inflicted with unforeseen but genuine needs.&nbsp; Often, these desperate individuals seek the services of loansharks simply because they are easily assessable and non-discriminatory, unlike banks or financial institutions which often make it difficult for people to borrow money with their endless checks and demands for collaterals. I would like to reiterate the idea of a microloan scheme which has been mooted in this House before by&nbsp;my colleagues and also today, a few speakers before me have also again called for this to be implemented.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is&nbsp;so that the genuinely desperate individuals can borrow at affordable interest rates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a scheme is not impossible as I was pleasantly surprised to read an article contributed by one Miss Jane Yeo in the October-December 2009 edition of the Handicaps Welfare Association&rsquo;s \"Handicaps Digest\" entitled \"Micro-Finance Scheme: How I Benefited From This\". Ms Yeo is apparently a person with disabilities and getting a small start-up, interest-free loan for a time limit of 10 months under the Association&rsquo;s micro-finance assistance scheme has helped her <p align=left>Column: 2118</p>to own and run her retail business successfully and she was also able to make a small profit. According to Ms Yeo, the flexibility of the scheme allows her to repay instalments of $500 or $1,000 and there was no penalty for late \"submission\", she used the word \"submission\",&nbsp;by which I think, she could mean \"repayment\". She also did not have to provide a guarantor nor must she have a minimum income to be eligible to apply for this loan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This article shows that if the Handicaps Welfare Association could provide its members with disabilities to be self-reliant through micro-funding, there should be other institutions that should be able to do even better and in the process help to eradicate the huge problems caused by small loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, I applaud the amendments and the resolute move by MHA to nip the illegal money-lending problem in the bud.&nbsp; The new amended laws alone will not be the dynamic panacea to this age-old problem.&nbsp; We should continue to explore ways to curb demand as well.&nbsp; Likewise, the law enforcement arm has an even greater role to leverage on the new ambit of powers and far-reaching jurisdiction to combat and minimise, if not, eradicate the proliferation of such illegal activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me at this stage to provide a reply to what Prof. Paulin Straughan had said just now, when she said that the new measures appear to be just cutting tentacles from the kingpins and she questioned the effectiveness of such a measure.&nbsp; I believe that if Prof. Straughan were to be confronted with families who have been harassed by loansharks or she&nbsp;has been in an environment where she sees these notes and demand notices pasted and even paints splashed&nbsp;all over the house, I think she will understand why cutting off the tentacles bit by bit is better than trying to catch the kingpin at <p align=left>Column: 2119</p>one go because when the resident calls out for help, we will not be in a position to tell them, \"wait, let us educate them\".&nbsp; What they demand for is actually immediate action, immediately, if not, yesterday.&nbsp; Therefore, I hope that MHA will, apart from cutting off the tentacles, also move further in to catch the kingpins that we want to net.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, first, I want to thank MPs who have spoken out in strong support of the Bill.&nbsp; Loansharks monitor what the Police and authorities do.&nbsp; I think this point is made also by Mr Arthur Fong, when he alluded to the amendments in 1993 when Prof. Jayakumar also said that those who are criminals out there actually watch what we do.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the emphatic message that we collectively send from this House today, that we will not tolerate loanshark or loansharking, I think that is very important.&nbsp; MPs have shared heart-rending accounts of how their residents have been hounded and harassed by merciless loansharks and their runners.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me say that my heart and I am sure all our hearts go out to these people and also the assurance from us that they do not walk alone in their travails and that is why we are raising the ante today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have taken some time to finalise this Bill as we have crafted its provisions very carefully.&nbsp; One key point which Members have spoken at some length on is the fact that we have not criminalised borrowing.&nbsp; Well, as I have said earlier in my speech, there are indeed pros and cons.&nbsp; And the debate in this House reflects this diversity of views.&nbsp; So let us take some time to assess the measures that we are introducing today and then we can, further down the road, assess if there is a need to take this measure.&nbsp; Now, as many MPs have highlighted, Ms Ellen Lee, Prof. Paulin Straughan, Ms Audrey Wong, Mdm <p align=left>Column: 2120</p> Cynthia Phua, Mr Seah Kian Peng, Mr Arthur Fong, amongst others, there are borrowers out there who would have a genuine financial need and some of them turn to loansharks. &nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But I would say that compared to the number of gamblers who turned to loansharks, this is probably a considerably smaller number.&nbsp; There could be some.&nbsp; The key point is to reach out to these people and to let them know that there are avenues of help.&nbsp; Of course, we can argue whether more can be done.&nbsp; I think many suggestions have been raised in this House that more can be done.&nbsp; But the first point is to impress upon them that if they are&nbsp;in&nbsp;a genuine need, they should not be shy or diffident about approaching avenues of help.&nbsp; So part of the aim for this debate is also to reach out to these people and to let them know that they must also help themselves by letting their needs be known.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have said in my Second Reading speech, there are other viable and, more importantly, legal avenues of credit.&nbsp; For one, I have mentioned the scheme for licensed moneylenders that has been&nbsp;liberalised&nbsp;&ndash; I think Mr Seah Kian Peng has lauded that.&nbsp; Now they can operate from more locations and indeed, the contact details of all the licensed moneylenders and the pawnbrokers are set out in the website of the Insolvency&nbsp;and Public Trustee's Office (IPTO).&nbsp; Actually, the number of loans has also risen as a result of this liberalisation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another source of credit which MPs have highlighted&nbsp;&ndash; I think Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr Seah Kian Peng&nbsp;&ndash; is credit co-operatives which some will know as Thrift and Loan Societies.&nbsp; In fact, Mr Seah Kian Peng is on the Council of the Singapore National Co-operative Federation.&nbsp; This movement is doing good work, helping out many Singaporeans but of course the restricting factor is that they must be members.&nbsp; I understand that there are about 39 of such credit co-operatives with about a quarter million of members.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2121</p>So it is a viable source of borrowing for its members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Seah has argued, in particular, that this source of funding should be further opened up, and I think he has suggested two or three ways.&nbsp; MCYS oversees credit co-operatives and its response is that the social role of credit co-operatives is to promote thrift among members and serve their mutual needs.&nbsp; It is best served when the members and the management of a co-operative share a close relationship.&nbsp; So there should be a nexus, in terms of whether we should have a wider criteria for membership and&nbsp;open up to more Singaporeans.&nbsp; But the very idea of a co-operative means that there is a shared relationship, some nexus, maybe employees of the same company, which then fosters confidence that the deposits are in safe hands because these co-operatives&nbsp;take fixed deposits as well as lend money.&nbsp;&nbsp;The response is that credit co-operatives should therefore come from clearly defined membership bases whose individuals share affiliations with one another.&nbsp; In addition, as credit co-operative membership is not open to the general public, it is not necessary for them to advertise in&nbsp;mass media.&nbsp; I believe the credit co-operatives have their own ways of reaching out to their members through various forms of publicity.&nbsp; So I say&nbsp;to Mr Seah, Mr Sin and others who argue for more to be done on this score, to take it up separately with MCYS and to convince the Minister that more can be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the clan associations, I do not think that there is anything to stop them from lending money to their members.&nbsp; I think lending by clan associations was&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua's point.&nbsp; Many of them do not do that.&nbsp; Some of them do not have the resources.&nbsp; But if they want to do so, they can if&nbsp;it is within the ambit of their constitution, provided they get approval from the Registrar of Moneylenders.&nbsp; I <p align=left>Column: 2122</p>think it can be done.&nbsp; As to companies lending to their employees, I think some companies do that as a matter of welfare for employees.&nbsp; Different companies have different policies.&nbsp; I think we should leave it to these companies to devise a policy that suits them best.&nbsp; Mdm Phua, in a very heartfelt manner, said that companies should be incentivised.&nbsp; Here, again, it is a matter of policy for&nbsp;MOF to consider.&nbsp; If she wants to take it up with MOF, I think that is something she can consider.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I welcome these suggestions because these show&nbsp;that Members are thinking as to how we can enhance the net of legitimate borrowing.&nbsp; I say this also in response to the Micro Loan Scheme that Ms Ellen Lee has suggested.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;it was&nbsp;raised&nbsp;in the House last year.&nbsp; MCYS at that time said there was no need to do that because there are other schemes in Singapore,&nbsp;by SPRING Singapore, POSB loan scheme and other avenues.&nbsp; Unlike other countries, I think in particular, less developed countries like Bangladesh, there is a clear example there; the Grameen Bank,&nbsp;in Singapore, these are other ways of raising small&nbsp;loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So educating Singaporeans on the options is a key point.&nbsp; And I am happy that there are organisations like Credit Counselling Singapore, I think we have heard of the organisation, it is doing good work.&nbsp;&nbsp;They&nbsp;reach out to borrowers to explore their options and indeed, even refer them to&nbsp;legitimate sources of credit and, in some cases, even help them&nbsp;work out&nbsp;debt repayment schemes.&nbsp;So, my call therefore in this House today is that people who need help, please do not turn to a loanshark&nbsp;because we all know that it may appear to be an easy way out.&nbsp; Your friends may encourage you, you may be enticed.&nbsp; But really, it is a slippery slope.&nbsp; Go to these agencies that we have talked about.&nbsp; If you are not clear, in fact, there are three touchpoints that they can press. First, Community Development Councils, those are very accessible on the ground.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2123</p>There are 36 Family Service Centres located all around Singapore and also all of us who&nbsp;run grassroots organisations will know that we are all ready to help.&nbsp; There is also a ComCare&nbsp;toll-free hotline 1800-222-0000.&nbsp; MCYS is&nbsp;keen, I think we all know that, to reach out to people who need help. So whether it is through the hotline&nbsp;or whether through calendars,&nbsp;or whether it is through banners and posters displayed at HDB void decks or displayed in CCs and schools, or indeed in MCYS and CDCs' websites,&nbsp;all these financial assistance schemes are publicised.&nbsp; MCYS informs me that it will continue to work closely with the CDCs and grassroots leaders to publicise these efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, about $50 million was dispensed through the ComCare scheme to needy Singaporeans.&nbsp; So, therefore, once again, there are community organisations, grassroots bodies and commercially driven bodies out there who can extend help.&nbsp; But the key point really, having said this, is that ultimately, it must be a matter of personal responsibility.&nbsp; I think this is a point that Ms Audrey Wong makes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for more education to let people know that,&nbsp;unless it is something that they cannot help themselves, in other words, a sudden unexpected bill that falls upon them like a medical bill or an accident where you have to pay a certain bill,&nbsp;if it is a matter of spending on their part or of incurring debt from buying things, there are signposts along the way where a person should know that he is reaching a danger point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I think in this House, several times already, the Minister for Finance has mentioned the MoneySENSE&nbsp;programme, which is a national programme helping Singaporeans understand more about financial planning and financial responsibility.&nbsp; I am glad to say that MoneySENSE is working with CDCs to run basic money management workshops for low-income <p align=left>Column: 2124</p>families.&nbsp; Indeed, on its part, MOE has introduced financial literacy concepts into the school curriculum.&nbsp; This is more of a longer-term approach perhaps, but it is still something which is important because we all know that this loanshark problem will be with us for some time.&nbsp; All these building blocks are important even as we address the problems within&nbsp;a more immediate time frame.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of counselling of debtors, that is another point&nbsp;which Members have raised&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I think Prof. Paulin Straughan, Ms Audrey Wong, Ms Irene Ng, Er Lee Bee Wah.&nbsp; The key message to desperate borrowers who had borrowed for whatever reasons and who feel that&nbsp;they are on sinking ground is that they need not despair.&nbsp; The message must be that there is a choice to become a runner to pay off&nbsp;their debt.&nbsp; I think we focus on&nbsp;this quite a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are runners out there who may feel that they have no choice&nbsp;or who may feel&nbsp;threatened by loansharks who may be so pressurised that everybody is standing against them that they think the best way or the only way to let off the steam is to succumb, but that is really the beginning of a bigger problem.&nbsp;So resist the&nbsp;pressure because there are avenues of help out there.&nbsp; I am very happy to say that a lot of these avenues are run by expert people on the ground&nbsp;&ndash; voluntary welfare organisations like One Hope Centre, I think Ms Irene Ng talked about it.&nbsp; In fact, I went to the 5th Anniversary of One Hope Centre just last month and they are doing good work among debtors.&nbsp; There is&nbsp;Tanjong Pagar&nbsp;Family Service Centre, there is a Care Corner&nbsp;Singapore.&nbsp; They are voluntary welfare organisations who are gearing up to do this, manned by volunteers who are prepared to help.&nbsp; They also run helplines, for example, Credit Counselling Singapore has a website <I>www.ccs.org.sg</I> and indeed&nbsp;debtors can call the number, 1800-2255277, to check out the services.&nbsp; I think this is the point that I want to <p align=left>Column: 2125</p>respond to.&nbsp; I think Mr Sin made the point that it would be better if Government runs a dedicated helpline where people can turn to, manned by experts.&nbsp; I would offer the&nbsp;current alternative which is the many-helping-hands approach, tapping expertise which is out there already and working with them so that they can reach out to more people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it was Assoc.&nbsp;Prof. Paulin Straughan who talked about mandating counselling by the Courts.&nbsp; In terms of Court punishment, it is really up to the Courts to decide.&nbsp; In the appropriate case, whether it is mandating&nbsp;counselling or as I think Ms Phua suggests, community service.&nbsp; It is really up to the Court to decide whether in the appropriate case, this is the thing to do.&nbsp; The message we have sent is that&nbsp;you should not be doing any harassment, even for youths because we know that loansharks out there are exploiting youths.&nbsp; The numbers have gone up almost three times last year, compared to the year before.&nbsp; The youths are an easy group to exploit but really, whether the paint is splashed by a 15-year-old or paint splashed by a 25-year-old, it is still being&nbsp;splashed.&nbsp; The frustration, the anxiety, the fear is still caused.&nbsp; So I think&nbsp;this is a message we want to very clearly send.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said this, educating the youths, I think, is also very important.&nbsp; This is a point that many of the MPs have made.&nbsp; That even though we are tough with youths, we must take a multi-pronged approach.&nbsp; This is what Ms Audrey Wong says.&nbsp; And let them know beforehand that they should not succumb to the temptation or to the thrill of becoming harassers.&nbsp; In other words, being sucked into vice.&nbsp; So whilst on its part, this Bill takes that step of deterring adults from exploiting youths, but this is a very focused approach,&nbsp;youths themselves must also be dealt with if they do wrong <p align=left>Column: 2126</p>but at the same time helped so that they will not do wrong with proper advice and proper education.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Members have made very valuable suggestions, whether it is parental vigilance or education.&nbsp; I think Ms Lee talks about that.&nbsp;I think she has raised a Parliamentary Question on this and an answer has been given by MOE.&nbsp;&nbsp;More resources are being dedicated now to counselling youths on the pitfalls of,&nbsp;for example, gambling addiction.&nbsp; Those are very good points, and it is good that the&nbsp;House sees&nbsp;this issue especially with the coming of the IRs. The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) is gearing up, that body is doing much more now, for example, like what Prof. Straughan says, to better understand the phenomenon of gambling, in particular amongst youths.&nbsp; In fact, last year, they organised a conference in August.&nbsp;A big conference where they brought people together&nbsp;&ndash; people who are experts in the field, and 300 participants attended, 150 of whom were from the schools.&nbsp; These are dedicated and very focused efforts and I think we can all support them.&nbsp; Police, on its part, works very closely with the schools.&nbsp; Police also reaches out to the youths.&nbsp; Police in fact has been more proactive now with its new media outreaches.&nbsp; It has got&nbsp;a&nbsp;YouTube video titled \"Second Thoughts\"&nbsp;warning youths of the dire consequences of such behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, NCPG partnered the National Addictions Management Services to hold this conference that I talked about last year.&nbsp; So it is also drawing&nbsp;expertise from the ground.&nbsp; This National Addictions Management Services was formerly called CAMP, based in IMH.&nbsp; So that is what NCPG is doing.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so the point, therefore, for youths is that whilst we punish them, yet at the same time we help them by steering them away from the slippery slope.&nbsp;A question has been asked&nbsp;by Ms Joscelin Yeo and also by Mdm Cynthia Phua whether we <p align=left>Column: 2127</p>will consider raising&nbsp;the age of the under-16s, maybe to under-21.&nbsp; Mdm Phua suggested under-18.&nbsp; Well, let us look at how this provision works out first.&nbsp; This is a first cut.&nbsp; Yes, I agree that there are also those who are over 16 who are also being exploited.&nbsp;I will say&nbsp;&ndash; and I will say the same&nbsp;for many of the suggestions&nbsp;&ndash; that we will monitor and we will assess the need to toughen the law or to widen the net. So, currently, we will keep it at under-16.&nbsp; Also on this provision, Mr Heng Chee How asked if we are talking about someone who is 21 or above exploiting someone under-16,&nbsp;how about someone who is 19 years old? Are we not letting this guy get away with it?&nbsp; Well, I think the&nbsp;mischief&nbsp;behind this provision is not to let an adult exploit the youths.&nbsp; So, technically and&nbsp;legally, an adult is considered someone 21 years and above.&nbsp; In any case, wherever you draw the line, there will be somebody who is just below it.&nbsp; So taking the mischief into consideration, I think we will keep it at that.&nbsp; But do not forget&nbsp;&ndash; I think Ms Joscelin Yeo also makes that point&nbsp;&ndash; that somebody who is 19 years old who instigates someone under 16 to commit either harassment or to become a loanshark is actually&nbsp;liable for punishment.&nbsp; It is just that the new provision does not apply to him.&nbsp; But as an instigator, he would be punished anyway.&nbsp; So it is not a matter of&nbsp;him getting away scot-free but this provision not applying to him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;make this point about&nbsp;borrowers who have become harassers.&nbsp; I think there have been some sympathy raised in this House for this group and for the need to distinguish this group of borrowers who become harassers for loansharks.&nbsp; First of all, what we have done in this Bill is to ensure that both groups are punished and I think rightly so both groups should be punished.&nbsp; And from what we have heard in this House,&nbsp;from what&nbsp;I&nbsp;said in my speech, there is, in fact,&nbsp;organised crime; there&nbsp;is layering. Everybody plays a part.&nbsp; They may play <p align=left>Column: 2128</p>different parts but because they are working in concert the pain and problem is perpetuated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The example we have used here is Hydra and the tentacles, and some Members said, very graphically, that \"yes, we have to continue working by cutting off the tentacles, even as we try to attack the head\".&nbsp; And indeed this Bill, like Mr Christopher de Souza aptly puts it, introduces new powers whilst we enhance the traditional punishment of jail and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;But really, the nub of this Bill is that we want to do more to attack the source, which is the kingpins.&nbsp; So, we have freezing provisions and&nbsp;provisions where there can be inspection of documents.&nbsp; And yet, at the same time, we have to address the ongoing problem on the ground so we have to cut off the tentacles.&nbsp; We have to ensure that the harassers do not perpetuate the ill intentions of the loansharks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is what&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng also talks about when she asks \"where is the Police?\"&nbsp; In fact, Police is working very hard and I want to give her and this entire House the assurance that Police is in fact taking this seriously.&nbsp; As&nbsp;I have said in my speech, Police has geared up&nbsp;its resources, re-organised itself, working closely with the ground.&nbsp; But as I have also said in my speech, loansharking is not an offence that is easily solved unless you catch the person red-handed or he leads you to the kingpin, to the loanshark.&nbsp; Very often, they do not even know who the loanshark is and the numbers do not help because it is probably from a prepaid SIM card and the SIM card has been sold to either a borrower who has disappeared or sometimes even foreign workers who have disappeared.&nbsp; But the assurance I want to give is that Police is serious. And over the last six months, as I have said, because the community has matched the seriousness of the Police,&nbsp;not just in terms of the&nbsp;community on the ground, but also MPs&nbsp;like Mdm Phua, who has been <p align=left>Column: 2129</p>leading from the front, and Mr de Souza who has pledged support for&nbsp;Ulu Pandan, and other MPs&nbsp;in this House&nbsp;also&nbsp;doing this, working together, we have make many more arrests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let us continue to do that&nbsp;&ndash; look at both groups and&nbsp;understand that they play different roles. Mr Cheng says in future he hopes more can be done to enhance the punishment of the loansharks.&nbsp; This is something we can consider in the future but I think the scope of punishment is sufficient for now. And this I also say in&nbsp;reply to Mr Arthur Fong and to Mr Heng Chee How and to others who have argued that there should be enhanced punishment for various offences.&nbsp; We have, like I said, drafted the provisions very carefully, calibrated, poised, quite balanced.&nbsp; Whether we need to do more, we will take a relook later as the provisions work out on the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hri Kumar asked about the borrowers who provide correct information but subsequently change their place of residence.&nbsp; He said can we do more for this group or indeed even borrowers as a group who borrow and their neighbours are harassed.&nbsp; My experience is that the borrowers are often&nbsp;apologetic, they&nbsp;are sorry that this has happened, they will try to cooperate with the Police, with the neighbours to try and rectify the situation.&nbsp; Some, in fact, also help to rectify the damage by getting somebody to paint over the graffiti.&nbsp; Members also know that the Town Councils have been working on this so when there is such vandalism, they quickly get their act together to remove these signs which could possibly instill fear and anxiety.&nbsp; That is important.&nbsp; That is how victims recover, do not show that&nbsp;you are cowed and that is how as a community, everybody is chipping in.&nbsp; This is the point I really want to make&nbsp;&ndash; since the call here in August last year, as I showed from statistics, the number of <p align=left>Column: 2130</p>harassment cases has come down.&nbsp; But as Members&nbsp;all know, there is no trend, we have to press on but people have rallied and I think more can be done.&nbsp; I say this is also in response&nbsp;to Mdm Cynthia Phua's point&nbsp;when she talks about the UK project \"Stop the Loanshark Movement\".&nbsp; Actually, in Singapore we already have a movement because everybody is chipping in. So let us just continue to do what we are doing with, hopefully, more projects, through the CSSP framework, for example, Citizens On Patrol, Neighbourhood Watch Groups,&nbsp;Stop the UML projects and schemes&nbsp;on the ground. All these are frameworks that can be used to fight loansharks.&nbsp; And I want to assure everybody that as&nbsp;they do their part on the ground, the NPCs will also&nbsp;give their full support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Mr Hri Kumar's point, therefore, on borrowers&nbsp;&ndash; this is something that we have not addressed.&nbsp; We all know that borrowers who have borrowed from loansharks, if they are still staying there, they will say, \"Well, it is also something that I really do not want happen to my neighbours.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;But the loanshark's tactics have been to inflict pain on the neighbours as well.&nbsp; It is not something that the borrowers would have wanted.&nbsp; So that is one group.&nbsp; The other group of borrowers would be borrowers&nbsp;who have moved.&nbsp; They have borrowed and then they move.&nbsp; Now, even for those who have moved, some may not have changed their addresses or, worse, there is also a group who borrowed based on a false address or a previous address.&nbsp; So there are&nbsp;gradations to culpability on the part of borrowers.&nbsp; What we have done is to take a focused approach, punishing the most blatant of the borrowers and these are people who borrow based on&nbsp;false addresses or their previous addresses and, therefore, mislead the loansharks. As I have said, we take a calibrated approach.&nbsp; Now it is focused but this is not the one-for-all panacea; we will continue to see whether more can be done.&nbsp; In the <p align=left>Column: 2131</p>meantime, one way of course is that if&nbsp;loansharks are caught and convicted in court, possibly a request for compensation can be made of the loansharks. We all know that under the CPC,&nbsp;a request for compensation can be made and if we can identify the homes, in particular, where these loansharks have been responsible for, perhaps that is a possibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hri Kumar has another suggestion on the use of a&nbsp;statutory declaration (SD).&nbsp; Can we make all HDB&nbsp;sellers declare that they are not indebted to a loanshark?&nbsp; Well, first of all, like I have said in my speech, actually less than 1% of HDB flats are attacked in such a manner.&nbsp; Even though&nbsp;all Members&nbsp;agree every flat attacked is one too many and&nbsp;our heart goes out for every flat attacked,&nbsp;to require a SD from&nbsp;all sellers&nbsp;would probably cause an inconvenience to a much&nbsp;larger majority of legitimate sellers who do not sell and move away knowing that they have outstanding loans from loansharks. So I think that is not necessary.&nbsp; Basically, these are two unrelated transactions&nbsp;&ndash; the sale transaction of HDB and the taking of a SD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Heng asked why we restrict ourselves to HDB's database.&nbsp; In terms of intelligence gathering, it is not so much to find out where the loansharks are.&nbsp; He probably knows that access to HDB's database is&nbsp;to find out, for example, where the borrower has moved to and, in particular, to enable ICA to have a better idea as to people out there who have shifted but have not registered their new address.&nbsp;Well, this is something we can look at because currently under police investigations, Police can already access, for example, the repository of addresses in the Singapore Land Authority's database.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are private addresses.&nbsp;It is very unlikely that a person who has sold an HDB flat who owes money would have moved to a private property.&nbsp; This only captures the owners.&nbsp; So whilst there is still a possibility of doing that, we will&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2132</p>leave it as it is for now but because, as I have said, the&nbsp;vast majority of loanshark's problems take place in HDB flats,&nbsp;let us focus on that first.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the basic approach.&nbsp; We have taken three to four months to draft this.&nbsp; Since I raised this problem in Parliament about three to four years ago, we have taken so many steps. So this is one more final package&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;calibrated, targeted approach.&nbsp; Then we continue to monitor and see if there is a need to do more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members have raised the issue of the upcoming Integrated Resorts and whether that will lead to more loansharking or indeed more criminal elements coming here.&nbsp; I think Ms Audrey Wong asked this.&nbsp; Let me first say that our tough laws which include the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act already deter many from coming here. I have explained this many times in Parliament over each five-year period to extend the CLTPA, the role of the CLTPA in deterring these criminals.&nbsp; Specifically, on the IR spillover effect on crime, to counter this possibility, we have since 2005 work assiduously.&nbsp; So MHA has set up the Casino Regulatory Authority (CRA) to oversee the conduct of the casino operators and their key employees.&nbsp; For example, under the Casino Control Act,&nbsp;the casino operator must take all appropriate steps to ensure that unlicensed moneylending or related activities is not conducted by its employees, patrons or any other persons inside the casino.&nbsp;&nbsp;Casino operators who contravene this requirement will be liable to disciplinary action, including a variation of the terms of the casino licence and a financial penalty, not exceeding $1 million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to handle casino-related crimes, police is setting up the Casino Crime Investigation branch within CID's Specialised Crime Division.&nbsp; Now, the CRA and police will work hand-in-hand to prevent crime within and around the <p align=left>Column: 2133</p>casinos.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Commissioner of Police can impose statutory exclusion orders on criminals or suspected criminals to prohibit them from entering the casinos and using them as a place to perpetrate their illegal activities.&nbsp; Going forward, MHA will consider the need to introduce an Organised Crime Bill, which some countries&nbsp;have done, to tackle crime syndicates holistically.&nbsp; If we do that, we can then look at whether some of the provisions that we are introducing today should be incorporated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other point that Ms Wong raised&nbsp;&ndash; the involvement of foreigners in&nbsp;unlicensed moneylending activities, either as loansharks or as borrowers&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;my response is</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>that police investigations have not uncovered any foreign loansharking syndicates operating here, although some elements of the business could be conducted overseas in neighbouring countries to evade police detection.&nbsp; In fact, this is one reason why we are having this new provision of having extra-territorial jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mdm Cynthia Phua, and as I said in my speech and I think Mr Sin has pointed that out, the SPF indeed has good cooperation with its neighbouring counterparts.&nbsp; That would be stepped up and, as and when necessary, Interpol's help can be brought in.&nbsp; But&nbsp;this excellent cooperation, in particular with our neighbouring countries built up over time&nbsp;&ndash; fighting&nbsp;various kinds of crimes&nbsp;&ndash; can be tapped effectively to fight loansharking.&nbsp; As to Ms Wong's other query on borrowers, the indication is that the vast majority of borrowers are Singaporeans.&nbsp; So it is not a problem that foreigners have created.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On mandatory punishment&nbsp;&ndash; I think this is the point that Mr Calvin Cheng has made&nbsp;&ndash; whether mandatory punishment will put a fetter on&nbsp;the Court's discretion <p align=left>Column: 2134</p>in sentencing.&nbsp; Actually, mandatory punishment, for example, mandatory imprisonment, it&nbsp;means that the Court has to jail a person.&nbsp; But within that power,&nbsp;there is a range where the Court can jail a person either for \"x\" years or \"x plus y\" years.&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sense, the Court will still have some discretion,&nbsp;taking into account the mitigating circumstances of the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is his key point.&nbsp; Whether it removes the Court's ability to take into account mitigating&nbsp;circumstances, the answer will be no, because still the Court can consider that.&nbsp; Many MPs, in fact, have highlighted the fact that we have imposed minimum mandatory punishment.&nbsp; I think as this House knows, we do not do that lightly as a government.&nbsp; We do it when the situation warrants it.&nbsp; And that is why at this point in time when we have to send a strong message, we have included some mandatory minimum punishment in the Bill,&nbsp;I am sure the message will sink in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point which I think Mr Calvin Cheng and Mdm Cynthia Phua want assurance&nbsp;on is&nbsp;that if the&nbsp;harm is perpetrated through a company set-up rather than individual loanshark, will just the company be punished?&nbsp; What about the perpetrators behind it?&nbsp; Will they hide behind the cloak of the company?&nbsp; The answer will be no because under the Moneylenders Act, when an offence is committed with the consent or connivance of an officer of the company, the officer is also guilty of the offence and is liable to the punishment as an individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;That stands to reason.&nbsp; Indeed, in an appropriate case, the corporate veil can also be lifted and proceedings initiated directly against&nbsp;the individual himself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the freezing framework, Mr Hri Kumar wants an assurance that it will be exercised judiciously.&nbsp; I think that will be the case, although&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua takes the other position and says, \"Why not let an ASP do the freezing?\"&nbsp; I think <p align=left>Column: 2135</p>let us keep the current position because it is a new approach insofar as moneylending is concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, safeguards have been built in because the Minister must be satisfied that there is reasonable cause to do this.&nbsp; The Minister can only issue a freezing order&nbsp;if he has&nbsp; reasonable cause to believe that the property or funds in the account are proceeds from the detained loanshark's loansharking activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are safeguards because anyone who is affected by the Order can apply to Court to get it lifted and, also, we have made provisions where someone who is affected, family members, for example, can ask the&nbsp;Minister to&nbsp;give a licence to deal with the money.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;other point that Mdm Phua makes is whether the loanshark can&nbsp;funnel his monies away and escape the long arms of the law.&nbsp; The answer is no, because&nbsp;the freezing order can also be used against his family members.&nbsp; But there is&nbsp;still the need for the Minister to be satisfied&nbsp;that there is reasonable cause to believe that these are proceeds arise from&nbsp;loansharking.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I have covered most of the points.&nbsp; As regards clarifications on new offences,&nbsp;Mr Heng suggests that those who knowingly arrange and/or provide any kind of logistical support, for example, materials such as pig heads, incendiary&nbsp;materials, should also come under the definition of \"abetment\".&nbsp; I assure him that the list of acts set out under the new section 28(1) which are deemed to be abetment of the harassment offence is not intended to be exhaustive.&nbsp; Arranging or providing for these logistical support can be considered as abetment, which includes intentionally aiding by an act&nbsp;&ndash; the commission of the offence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, whether a particular act of assistance is caught will depend upon the actual facts and circumstances of the case.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seah Kian Peng&nbsp;made quite useful suggestions for more to be done on the <p align=left>Column: 2136</p>ground.&nbsp; Let me assure him that insofar as use of CCTVs&nbsp;is concerned, yes, more are being deployed because it may have a deterrent effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Police also has acquired more sets and this would be deployed on the ground as necessary.&nbsp; As to whether there is a need to paste the photos of known loansharks or syndicates&nbsp;on the notice boards, I think the current approach really is that the call for information is, in fact,&nbsp;more dispersed&nbsp;&ndash; through&nbsp;TV,&nbsp;the&nbsp;printed press, and in&nbsp;cases where publicity is required, it is not of the loansharks.&nbsp; It is of people who are caught on CCTV&nbsp;&ndash; these are your possible harassers.&nbsp;In that sense, I think it is better to disperse it because the guy may not be&nbsp;just&nbsp;living in that block.&nbsp; He is probably from all over the place.&nbsp; Actually when Police started doing this about three years ago, there have been some good results where arising from these publicity outreaches, information that has been rendered has led to&nbsp;arrests.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether we should have money rewards&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Mr Seah talks about whether there can be&nbsp;some incentive for information to be given&nbsp;&ndash; I would say that that is not&nbsp;Police practice. &nbsp;We have not gone on this approach, that this is the path that&nbsp;some&nbsp;other countries have&nbsp;taken where&nbsp;they offer money for information.&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have done in Singapore is where, outside of loansharking, generally, four out of&nbsp;10 crimes are solved with the public input, and that is wonderful,&nbsp;the public give input without expectation of a financial reward.&nbsp; That should be encouraged and this, in fact, is happening for loansharking too.&nbsp; As many Members have said, people are banding together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us continue to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to Mr Sin's point about&nbsp;whether more should be done in terms of using the powers&nbsp;&ndash; I think he talks about the need to track movements in terms of understanding the flow of funds&nbsp;&ndash; actually the new section 30(A) empowers the <p align=left>Column: 2137</p>Public Prosecutor&nbsp;to authorise the Police to inspect documents containing information of suspected loansharks as well as the spouses, sons, daughters, trustees and agents.&nbsp; So using this power, Police can, when they are investigating a case, track the accounts and fund movements.&nbsp; And when they do this, they will glean insights into the syndicate's network and the identity of its members.&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision, of course, will exist alongside current existing provisions under, for example, the STRO (Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office), where I think Mr Sin, as a lawyer,&nbsp;will know that financial institutions are obligated to report a suspicious transaction.&nbsp; So I think this combination of provisions is good enough because we also need to maintain&nbsp;a balance, not to over-reach in this tracking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I have covered most of the points.&nbsp; It is a long session.&nbsp; I thank Members for their many useful suggestions.&nbsp; I have not said yes to all these suggestions because we are at a point when we are assessing and seeing whether more can be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;But certainly we will continue to track the number of cases and our progress.&nbsp; And if there is a need to tighten up, I will look at some of the suggestions that have been raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten MPs from the PAP and&nbsp;four NMPs have spoken, giving very valuable inputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite unfortunate that none of the Opposition MPs has spoken.&nbsp; But, in any case,&nbsp;what&nbsp;MPs have spoken about today have contributed to making Singapore safe and secure,&nbsp;because it is spoken from the heart.&nbsp; In fact, particularly elected MPs,&nbsp;they have really reflected the anguish of their residents.&nbsp; I think that is laudable and, hopefully, with everybody working together, we can reduce this scourge.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This caters not only to rising aspirations, but also to different segments of flat buyers with varying preferences and budgets within the $8,000 income ceiling.&nbsp; This means that such choices are offered to almost 80% of households in Singapore.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB remains committed to keeping flats affordable, especially for those setting up their first homes. I am happy to note that about&nbsp;eight in 10 new flat buyers service their housing loans entirely using CPF monies without any cash outlay. This is possible due to our generous subsidy system. All new flats come with a generous market subsidy.&nbsp; Households earning less than $5,000 monthly can apply for Additional CPF Housing Grants (AHG) of up to $40,000. HDB also offers concessionary loans to eligible households. First-timers can also enjoy a CPF Housing Grant of up to $40,000 when they buy a resale flat, DBSS flat or EC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main supply of new flats is the Build-To-Order (BTO) Exercise, where HDB offers generously-subsidised flats for the mass market.&nbsp; For those with higher income and aspirations, there are premium flats under the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS), and one-off special projects in mature estates such as the Pinnacle@Duxton. Households earning up to $10,000 per month can buy Executive Condominiums (EC).&nbsp; Further, a wide range of flats is available in the resale market. For those with specific preferences in terms of location, they may have to pay a premium.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2147</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While HDB provides many choices, flat buyers must play their part too.&nbsp; They should exercise prudence and buy within their means. Let me illustrate. A family with monthly household income of $3,000 who spends 30% on housing can buy a flat of up to $250,000.&nbsp; This covers all the new 3-room flats in HDB&rsquo;s most recent BTO projects in Choa Chu Kang and Hougang in Jan 10. They also have a selection of the 4-room flats, where prices start at about $230,000. At $4,000 monthly income, a family can afford up to $333,000 without spending more than 30% every month. They can comfortably buy any of the flats offered in the January 10 BTO.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB is committed to ensuring a sufficient supply of new flats. In 2009, HDB sold 13,500 new flats, half of which were launched in the last quarter to meet strong demand. These flats were in a variety of towns, across all flat types from Studio Apartments, 2-room, 3-room, 4-room to 5-room, with 4-room making up the majority. HDB is also building more 2- and 3-room flats to cater to the needs of the lower income, even as it continues to provide for other groups. This year, taking into account the expected demand, flat buyers can look forward to about 12,000 new BTO flats if demand is sustained. These BTO flats will also be supplemented by DBSS flats and ECs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will continue to monitor changing demand and will make necessary changes to the BTO&nbsp; programme, in terms of number and mix, to ensure that there is adequate supply of affordable public housing for the various income groups.&nbsp;</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:UNDERGROUND WALKWAYS IN CITY HALL MRT VICINITY--><p align=left>Column: 2147<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:UNDERGROUND WALKWAYS IN CITY HALL MRT VICINITY:::2150--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>UNDERGROUND WALKWAYS IN CITY HALL MRT VICINITY</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Siong Seng--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Teo Siong Seng </B>asked the Minister for National Development whether his Ministry will consider building sheltered and underground walkways linking the City Hall MRT station with the commercial and Government office buildings along North Bridge Road and High Street for the benefit of many office workers, shoppers and tourists.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been planned as a pedestrian-friendly city, with an extensive network of covered and underground walkways.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the City Hall MRT Station, the Government has already safeguarded an underground pedestrian walkway from the station to the future development at the Capitol Theatre site, on the other side of North Bridge Road.

Our focus is therefore to make it safe for the various road users to share the space we have.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, the leftmost lane on which most cyclists travel is usually wider than the other lanes. This helps to accommodate the sharing of lane by cyclists and other motorists. Notwithstanding this, the LTA is also working with various community stakeholders and the Traffic Police to roll out a $43 million programme to design and <p align=left>Column: 2151</p>construct dedicated cycle tracks in&nbsp;five selected HDB Towns to facilitate intra-town cycling as a mode of transport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traffic calming measures are implemented along localised sections of roads where there is a need to moderate the speed of vehicles to suit the prevailing traffic conditions. These measures could include installing humps and strips or narrowing the lane with dividers and central islands. While there may be circumstances where cyclists would appreciate slower motor vehicle speeds, we also have to be mindful of the trade-offs when installing such measures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The installation of humps and strips, for example may affect the riding comfort of cyclists and their control of the bicycle. The narrowing of lanes may give rise to a situation where motorists have less room to overtake cyclists. Motorists may also get upset if they have to slow down too often. Nevertheless, if the Member has specific suggestions as where such traffic calming measures can be effective, LTA will be glad to look into it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To improve the safety of cyclists on the roads, LTA had worked with the Safe Cycling Task Force (SCTF) to install signs alerting motorists of the presence of cyclists along frequently used cycling routes, such as those in the&nbsp; West Coast and the Thomson areas.&nbsp; The scheme has been extended to selected routes along Mandai Road and Tuas Road as well. So far, the signs have been found to be effective and LTA will be putting them up at more roads that cyclists frequent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety of all road users, whether they be drivers, cyclists or pedestrians, is a shared responsibility.&nbsp; All road users will have to play their part by following the traffic rules and regulations, and exercise mutual accommodation and due consideration for each other.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:TREND FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES--><p align=left>Column: 2151<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:TREND FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES:::2154--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>TREND FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Ellen Lee </B>asked the Minister for Health in the past&nbsp;three years (a) how many cases of sexually transmitted diseases other than HIV (such as genital warts, herpes, venereal disease, gonorrhea, etc) are seen in the clinics, public and private hospitals; (b) of these cases, how many are new cases and how many cases are Singaporeans; and (c) what trend is being detected by the Ministry from these statistics.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are notifiable in Singapore.&nbsp; To protect patients&rsquo; confidentiality, STI notifications need not include personal particulars.

We will continue to step up targeted education programmes and try out more effective ways to reach out to them.&nbsp; We will also continue to support those who want to quit smoking.&nbsp;</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:NEIGHBOUR DISPUTES IN HDB ESTATES--><p align=left>Column: 2155<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:NEIGHBOUR DISPUTES IN HDB ESTATES:::2158--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>NEIGHBOUR DISPUTES IN HDB ESTATES</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Lam Pin Min </B>asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of reported neighbour disputes in HDB estates over the past three years; (b) what are the resolution processes in place and their success rate; (c) what is the eventual outcome of such disputes; and (d) whether the new HDB Community Relations Department will take on the role of managing such disputes.&nbsp;</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2006 to 2008, HDB received an average of 1,600 complaints of neighbour disputes every year.&nbsp; This is less than 0.2% of the total number of households living in HDB estates.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration and tolerance amongst neighbours is key to harmonious living in HDB estates.&nbsp; When HDB receives a complaint from a resident about a neighbour, it will investigate whether any HDB rules have been breached.&nbsp; At the same time, HDB will advise the residents to be more considerate and cease their inconsiderate behaviour.&nbsp; Where appropriate, HDB will also counsel the complaining party to exercise greater tolerance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the disagreement persists, HDB will seek the help of grassroots leaders to mediate.&nbsp; Disputing parties can also go to the Community Mediation Centre to resolve their differences.&nbsp; However, recourse to mediation is voluntary.&nbsp; Whether mediation is successful depends on the willingness of both parties to continue to exercise consideration and tolerance thereafter.&nbsp; In more serious cases, the aggrieved party can file a Magistrate&rsquo;s Complaint.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although HDB tries to assist, it is not possible for Government agencies like HDB to be responsible for resolving private disputes between two neighbours.&nbsp; It is often one party&rsquo;s word against the other.&nbsp; It is often not clear who is in the wrong.&nbsp; Ultimately, private disputes need to be resolved privately, with the help of community mediation or through the legal process if necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND convened a workgroup involving a few Members of Parliament (1) &nbsp; last year to look into promoting harmonious living in HDB estates.&nbsp; The workgroup recommended promotion of greater public awareness of the \"dos\" and \"don&rsquo;ts\" of HDB living.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong </B>asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether protection for migrant workers has kept pace with the expansion of their numbers in Singapore; and (b) what measures are being taken to ensure that employers and employment agencies do not exploit the foreign workers by imposing high recruitment fees and withholding their passports.&nbsp;</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM has put in place several measures to better protect migrant workers.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have enhanced our laws to better protect our migrant workers.&nbsp; In 2007, the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act was reviewed to provide for enhanced penalties for offences involving foreign workers.&nbsp; In addition, MOM introduced new Work Permit and S Pass conditions in 2008 to make it an offence for employers to accept or ask for kickbacks(2),&nbsp; and reviewed the employment agencies licence conditions to prohibit local employment agencies from being party to kickbacks(3).&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1st January this year, we have implemented a new security bond condition to require employers to pay their foreign workers&rsquo; salaries promptly(4).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have intensified enforcement against errant employers.&nbsp; A total of 226 employers were prosecuted last year for various offences, including unpaid salaries, illegal deployment and phantom worker scams.&nbsp; Errant employers may also be barred from employing foreign workers in the future.&nbsp; MOM has also stepped up enforcement against errant employment agencies.&nbsp; In 2009, 11 employment agencies had their licences revoked and their security deposits forfeited due to infringements under the Employment Agencies Act or the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act(5).&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides losing the security deposits, the licensees and directors of these employment agencies are prohibited from holding employment agency licences or holding appointments in other employment agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, MOM has put in place early detection measures.&nbsp; For example, MOM monitors employers who default on levy payments to detect possible cases of salary arrears.&nbsp; MOM <p align=left>Column: 2159</p>has also stepped up inspections at foreign workers&rsquo; dormitories to ensure that workers are housed properly, and to check if they are receiving their salaries on time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we extend assistance to legitimate workers who are affected by employment malpractices.&nbsp; For example, MOM helps workers pursue their salary arrears with their employers, and facilitates the workers&rsquo; repatriation.&nbsp; MOM also works closely with the Migrant Workers Centre under the NTUC to reach out to the workers and provide humanitarian assistance such as food and lodging to those who require it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, MOM has increased foreign workers&rsquo; awareness of their employment rights and sources of help through several channels, such as information in the In-Principle Approval letters which are sent to migrant workers in their home countries prior to their departure for Singapore, a handbook given to all new workers in their native language, and regular dormitory road shows.&nbsp; New workers from the construction and marine sectors are also educated on their employment rights at their mandatory safety orientation courses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Member has pointed out, migrant workers may have paid high recruitment fees to come to Singapore.&nbsp; However, the bulk of such fees may be paid to fellow countrymen in their home countries, beyond Singapore&rsquo;s jurisdiction.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the foreign governments to enforce their laws and take action against the errant employment agencies in their own countries.&nbsp; Nonetheless, to facilitate the investigations of foreign governments, MOM works closely with foreign embassies and shares relevant information obtained during the course of our investigations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for employers and employment agents retaining workers&rsquo; passports, I would like to reiterate that employers should not retain their foreign workers' passports without their consent.&nbsp; Even if prior consent was given for the employers to retain the passports, the employers must return the passports upon the foreign workers' request.&nbsp; The Employment Agency Rules and licensing conditions clearly prohibit employment agencies from retaining the passports of foreign workers.&nbsp; Last year, two employment agencies were convicted and 33 sternly warned and issued with demerit points for withholding the passports of foreign workers.&nbsp; Two employment agencies are currently facing prosecution charges and eight other employment agencies are under investigation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While MOM will continue to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to deter any errant employers and protect migrant workers, ultimately we need all employers and workers to play their part in acting responsibly and cooperatively to build and sustain a strong workplace.</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Concerns that have been raised about crossing networks include possible market fragmentation and a lack of transparency.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) recognises these concerns and has brought crossing networks under its regulatory regime for recognised market operators(1) since September 2007.&nbsp; These market operators are permitted to offer trading access only to institutional investors, and have to comply with the relevant statutory obligations.&nbsp; These include ensuring that the market is fair and orderly; managing any risks associated with its business and operations prudently; and not acting contrary to the interests of the public.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, orders above S$150,000 or 50,000 shares can be executed off the Singapore Exchange (SGX) as SGX members can negotiate such orders directly with each other.&nbsp; These off-exchange trades are subject to relevant SGX trading rules which require a trade to be reported to the Exchange within 10 minutes of execution.&nbsp; SGX&rsquo;s rules seek to balance the ability of institutional investors to execute large transactions, minimising market impact costs(2), with the overall requirements of market transparency and integrity.&nbsp; MAS has required crossing networks to match only large orders that comply with the SGX off-exchange thresholds.&nbsp; As an additional measure to prevent liquidity in the exchange from being fragmented by the crossing network, MAS has set limits on the volume any crossing network can trade in any single SGX-listed share.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crossing networks are required to submit regular trade reports to MAS and maintain an audit trail of their trades.&nbsp; In addition, they have to report each trade to SGX to ensure consolidated post-trade transparency.&nbsp; This information forms part of a share&rsquo;s turnover, which is reported to the public.&nbsp; As part of its regular market surveillance and enforcement work, SGX is responsible for the detection of irregular trading and follow-up on suspicious trades, including possible insider trading.&nbsp; This applies to transactions put through crossing networks.&nbsp; Following its initial investigations, SGX will refer the case to MAS, where necessary.&nbsp; MAS has statutory powers to obtain information, including the identity of the investor.&nbsp; MAS therefore does not consider crossing networks to pose additional concerns on insider trading.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Crossing networks provide an efficient channel for institutional investors to deal in large blocks of shares.&nbsp; MAS will continue to monitor the development of crossing networks in Singapore as well as global regulations relating to these entities, and review our regulatory regime if needed.&nbsp;</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
