One of the reasons for this sorry state of\r\n\r\naffairs is the shortage of judges. From the Estimates, it\r\n\r\nis noted that provisions have been made for one Chief\r\n\r\nJustice, six High Court Judges, three Registrars/Senior\r\n\r\nDistrict Judges, one Deputy District Judge and seven\r\n\r\nDistrict Judges/Deputy Registrars. The total provision this\r\n\r\nyear is an addition of only one District Judge. Can the\r\n\r\nMinister let us know the number of vacancies there are at\r\n\r\nthe moment among the ranks of our District Judges and High\r\n\r\nCourt Judges? How many High Court Judges are re-employed\r\n\r\nafter retirement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commonly said that justice delayed is justice\r\n\r\ndenied. It is important that our cases are heard\r\n\r\nexpeditiously and justice meted out swiftly. If, as a\r\n\r\nresult of shortage of judges, cases are long delayed, then\r\n\r\nremedial measures must be taken to put right this position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that in the High Court, in respect of\r\n\r\ncapital punishment cases where two Judges sit on the Bench,\r\n\r\nwhen a case goes up for appeal and the Appeal Court decides\r\n\r\nto send the case down for a retrial, the case could not be\r\n\r\nretried as the result of a shortage of Judges. If this is\r\n\r\nso, then immediate remedial measures must be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister tell us what he proposes to do in\r\n\r\nrespect of filling up the vacancies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the Minister cannot\r\n\r\ntell him much because he is not in charge of appointments\r\n\r\nof High Court Judges or even Judges in the Lower Courts.\r\n\r\nBut the Member may well be aware that Judges of the High\r\n\r\nCourt are appointed by the President on the advice of the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, and it is incumbent on the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nto consult the Chief Justice before appointments are made.\r\n\r\nIf I may say so, one must be very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncareful when appointing judges. They must be men of\r\n\r\nexperience, ability and integrity, and have had several\r\n\r\nyears of legal experience at the Bar or in the legal\r\n\r\ndepartment of the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position in the High Court is that Mr Justice Tan Ah\r\n\r\nTah retired in November last year. So there is one seat\r\n\r\nvacant. Mr Justice D'Cotta retired at the end of February\r\n\r\nthis year but he has been re-appointed for another six\r\n\r\nmonths. Mr Justice Choor Singh is due to retire in July,\r\n\r\nand whether or not his employment will be extended depends\r\n\r\non the Prime Minister after consultation with the Chief\r\n\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for delays in the High Court, this is not just because\r\n\r\nthere is one judge short. Cases take some months or even\r\n\r\nyears, at least for civil cases, to go to trial after\r\n\r\npleadings, interrogatories, discovery of documents and a\r\n\r\nconvenient date to counsel for both sides and the\r\n\r\nlitigants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There does not seem to be a shortage of judges in the\r\n\r\nDistrict Courts or the Subordinate Courts. There again the\r\n\r\nappointments are made by the Legal Service Commission\r\n\r\nheaded by the Hon, the Chief Justice. I am in no position\r\n\r\nin this House to make comments on the appointments. Beyond\r\n\r\nthat, the Member may rest assured that the appointments and\r\n\r\nstate of the cases in the High. Court, or even the District\r\n\r\nCourts, are in the hands of capable persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N.

(* The  same  amendment also stood in the names of Messrs  N. Govindasamy and P.

With this particular amendment. I would like to\r\n\r\nrefer to the problem of the attitude of civil servants to\r\n\r\nthe public. Complaints in this House have been regular as\r\n\r\nalmost to be ritualistic regarding discourtesy shown to the\r\n\r\ngeneral public when they have approached various offices.\r\n\r\nor service centres, for example, the Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment, the Registry of Vehicles, the Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment; or the hospitals or clinics arid so on. Yet the\r\n\r\nproblem still remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair to senior Government officials, there have\r\n\r\nbeen attempts to bring to the attention of officers the\r\n\r\nneed for courtesy when dealing with the public. Circulars\r\n\r\non courtesy in the civil service and relations with the\r\n\r\npublic have been dutifully sent around to Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries and various officers on distribution lists. And\r\n\r\nthese circulars have even attempted to analyse what has\r\n\r\ncontributed to the problem. The Central Complaints Bureau\r\n\r\nhas. I am told, been asked to investigate more effectively\r\n\r\ncomplaints of discourtesy and petty bureaucracy and yet\r\n\r\nright up to the moment the problem still remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not exemplify. Every Member in this House can come\r\n\r\nup with instances of thoughtlessness and officiousness.\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong? Is it that something fundamental has been\r\n\r\noverlooked in the attempts to tackle this problem? It\r\n\r\ncannot be that the public are just cussed, that they insist\r\n\r\non having indelibly imprinted in their minds a poor image\r\n\r\nof Government departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that just as the bad impression of\r\n\r\nGovernment can become ingrained in the minds of people, so\r\n\r\nthe principal way to ensure that this does not happen is to\r\n\r\nhave the commitment to courtesy ingrained in the minds of\r\n\r\nthe civil servant, not merely at the level of contact with\r\n\r\nthe public but right up the line to the top-most\r\n\r\nadministrator. The concern of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncivil servant that should be his constant preoccupation is\r\n\r\nnot merely the accomplishment of a job and closing of a\r\n\r\nfile, but the citizens' welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the civil servant has frequently become so\r\n\r\ntask-oriented that he alt too often forgets whom he is\r\n\r\nserving - what he is doing the job for - namely, the\r\n\r\npeople's well-being. And every now and then he just wants\r\n\r\nto get on with the job, ignoring the sensitivities and\r\n\r\nneeds of the very people he is supposed to be doing the job\r\n\r\nfor. I hope when we are inducting our new administrative\r\n\r\ncadres into what should be their vocations, this point of\r\n\r\ncommitment to concern for the individual will be stressed\r\n\r\nfrom the beginning. I imagine that it is because of the\r\n\r\nabsence of this concern that there has again and again been\r\n\r\ncomplaints about discourtesy and bureaucratic indifference\r\n\r\nin the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now how can this commitment be demonstrated? Perhaps we\r\n\r\ncan ask some pertinent questions. Do our leaders in the\r\n\r\ncivil service, our super civil servants as they have been\r\n\r\ndescribed (although I do not quite understand this term),\r\n\r\ndo our top bureaucrats show their concern for the\r\n\r\nconditions in which people meet the civil servants, the\r\n\r\nconditions in which the civil servants themselves have to\r\n\r\nwork the whole day long? Is an office environment conducive\r\n\r\nto a good relationship between the civil servant and those\r\n\r\nhe has to serve? Are the public served in surroundings of\r\n\r\ncleanliness and reasonable comfort, or do we find light and\r\n\r\nventilation deficient and the organisation of space\r\n\r\nuneconomic, long queues, long waiting periods, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are toilet facilities adequate, canteens offering\r\n\r\nreasonable service, or is it perhaps that no such amenities\r\n\r\nexist at all? Are signboards properly displayed, or are\r\n\r\nthey tatty-looking, bent or frayed at the edges, and have\r\n\r\nunofficial doodlings all over them? Are those who handle\r\n\r\nthe public properly trained to feel sensitive, to put\r\n\r\nthemselves in the place of the petitioner, the client? If\r\n\r\nthere is a possibility that members of the public may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot understand rules and procedures, are these\r\n\r\nadequately explained?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now such concerns, I think. Mr Speaker, Sir, should\r\n\r\nbe the subject of attention at the very centre of\r\n\r\nmanagement in the bureaucracy. Senior civil servants\r\n\r\ncan be expected to set the standard and the example\r\n\r\nof demonstrating such interest and commitment, not\r\n\r\nthrough circulars only, but by action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point that one line of example also\r\n\r\nis to show human and personal concern for one's very\r\n\r\nown subordinates. I would like to hear more often of\r\n\r\na subordinate being frank, straightforward, firm and\r\n\r\nforthright with his superior, albeit maintaining due\r\n\r\nrespect for him. And superiors should show courtesy\r\n\r\nand consideration towards their subordinates, and\r\n\r\npatience in the face of difficulties encountered. Intelligent attention to the human element in the\r\n\r\nwork situation is in keeping with the best modern\r\n\r\nadministrative practice everywhere. Moreover, if\r\n\r\nthere are good manners and human respect within the\r\n\r\ncivil service family contributing to an esprit de\r\n\r\ncorps, this will show in the attitude towards the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, while senior officers have decided that inductees\r\n\r\ninto the administrative service should have the\r\n\r\nexperience of sitting with MPs in their meet-the-people sessions, let me invite senior officers\r\n\r\nthemselves - those near or at the top - to come and\r\n\r\nsee for themselves how people at the grass-roots\r\n\r\nfeel. The experience would be salutary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have brought up this matter because the closest the\r\n\r\npublic  come  to an appreciation of Government  is  at\r\n\r\nthe  point  of  contact with civil  servants.  If  the\r\n\r\nimpression  they gather at this point  of  contact  is\r\n\r\nunfavourable, then I am afraid their attitude  towards\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  be  affected  by  this  unfavourable\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, when I first filed this\r\n\r\namendment. I had the intention of enquiring into the\r\n\r\nneed for the setting up of this Establishment Unit\r\n\r\nwith 102 Division I officers, headed by a Deputy Secretary,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrade E. But since then, the Minister for Finance in his\r\n\r\nBudget Statement has clarified the functions of the\r\n\r\nEstablishment Unit in the Prime Minister's Office. There\r\n\r\nhas also been a press write-up on the Establishment Unit.\r\n\r\npresumably based on a release from the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is this, Sir. Where is the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice going to find the 102 high calibre officers,\r\n\r\nespecially in the 25-40 age group? If you look at Appendix\r\n\r\nA of Cmd. Paper No. 4/76, you will notice that every\r\n\r\nMinistry is dismally understaffed, especially in respect of\r\n\r\nDivision I officers. There are\r\n\r\n2.455     Division I vacancies in the Government service\r\n\r\nalone. However, I do welcome the establishment of such a\r\n\r\nunit to spot outstanding talent among our administrative\r\n\r\nofficers, and that it would also be responsible for career\r\n\r\ndevelopment and training, postings, transfers, secondments,\r\n\r\nand administration of the merit increment ~c he me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Member for Katong has said, perhaps another\r\n\r\narea that this Unit can look into is the frequency of\r\n\r\ncomplaints we hear in this House as well as outside, about\r\n\r\nthe rudeness and arrogance of our civil servants.\r\n\r\nespecially those who man the counters and come in contact\r\n\r\nwith the public. Perhaps this Unit must be armed with not\r\n\r\nonly the carrot but together with the carrot, the stick as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, it is noted\r\n\r\nthat an Establishment Unit has been set up in the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Office to coordinate the career development of\r\n\r\nall Division I officers in the whole Civil Service. This\r\n\r\nUnit has, as its main function, to look and fill the void\r\n\r\nleft by promising officers in the 30-45 age group. In\r\n\r\naddition to this, the Unit has also to look into the career\r\n\r\ndevelopment and training, postings, transfers and\r\n\r\nsecondments, and administration of the merit increment\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder why this Unit is only interested in\r\n\r\nDivision I officers. What about the promising, able and\r\n\r\nexperienced officers in the other Divisions? They too\r\n\r\nshould also be taken care of by this Unit. Some of them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay not have university degrees, but then they may be\r\n\r\nexcellent innovators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that the merit increment scheme is only\r\n\r\nmeant for Division I officers. Here again, what about\r\n\r\nofficers in the other Divisions who have performed well in\r\n\r\ntheir duties? Will they also not be considered for this\r\n\r\nmerit increment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I do not want to stand as a\r\n\r\ndefender of rude, arrogant, unfeeling and discourteous\r\n\r\ncivil servants. Where they exist, where they can be pin\r\n\r\npointed, action will be taken. There is for senior civil\r\n\r\nservants a Civil Service Staff Development Institute which,\r\n\r\namongst its other duties, tries to involve the civil\r\n\r\nservants in the wider aims of Government and the duties of\r\n\r\nthe Administration. The Civil Service, with the help of the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission, have tried to define those areas\r\n\r\nwhere the public comes into contact with the officials,\r\n\r\nwhether it is the Immigration Department, the Registry of\r\n\r\nVehicles, the hospitals, clinics, post offices, wherever\r\n\r\nthere is a counter, and attempts will constantly' be made\r\n\r\nto improve the way in which the public at large is being\r\n\r\nserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me pick up the point made by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Katong. He invited senior civil servants or\r\n\r\nsuper civil servants, as he has superciliously referred to\r\n\r\nthem, to sit with him at his meet-the-people sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> On a point of clarification. He is a\r\n\r\nMember and not a Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Katong. Thank you.\r\n\r\nSir, let me explain to him that if we pick out the really\r\n\r\noutstanding civil servants to sit with him or to sit with\r\n\r\nthe other MPs in the meet-the-people sessions, he ought to\r\n\r\nlook out and make sure that he is not displaced in some\r\n\r\nfuture election. We are professional in our relations with\r\n\r\nthe public. That is part of the business of the MP. If he\r\n\r\nis not good at it, then he would probably not be here. A\r\n\r\ncivil servant who can both do his job as an administrator\r\n\r\nand be good at the public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelations side of it, who is able to say `No\" to an\r\n\r\nobstreperous, vehement and insistent constituent who wants\r\n\r\nthe answer to be \"yes\" and wants his MP to bend the rules\r\n\r\nin order that the answer is \"yes\", would have learnt the\r\n\r\nsecret of politics and will comprise the Government. So I\r\n\r\nthink it is not an invitation to be made lightly and in\r\n\r\njest. Perhaps if the Member for Katong knows how to keep\r\n\r\nhis constituents happy whilst having to say \"No\" to them in\r\n\r\nthe politest of terms, he should patent the secret, hide it\r\n\r\naway in a file, and never show it to a good civil servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me place this against the broader context. First,\r\n\r\nI am glad that this is the maximum of criticism. There is\r\n\r\nno charge of dishonourable, corrupt or other practices. If\r\n\r\nM Ps come here and complain of discourtesy, inadequate\r\n\r\ntoilet or canteen facilities, tatty signboards, all this is\r\n\r\nin part a reflection of our relatively healthy state of\r\n\r\naffairs. In fact, we should have a conducted tour for MPs\r\n\r\nand some of their constituents, who complain of the\r\n\r\nbureaucratic practices, of parts of the Third World, and\r\n\r\nwhen they come back they would be extremely grateful that\r\n\r\nthey have Singapore and the Singapore Civil Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That having been said and done, I think we have to take\r\n\r\nthis in the context of our total society. Consideration for\r\n\r\neach other, courtesy or the lack thereof, comes out of a\r\n\r\nlong cultivation of good habits. It is extremely difficult\r\n\r\nto be polite and courteous to a crude, obstreperous and ill-mannered person. It is a two-way process, whether it is the\r\n\r\nSBS bus drivers and conductors against passengers, whether\r\n\r\nit is motorists versus lorry drivers, or motorists versus\r\n\r\nmotorists, or motorcyclists versus motorists, whether it is\r\n\r\njostling at the National Stadium or in the schools, it is\r\n\r\nthe general tenor of behaviour, the accepted standards of\r\n\r\nconduct of a society as a whole. In the last 1 7 years, or\r\n\r\nperhaps I should go back to 1955 when we had the first\r\n\r\nelected Government and the pressures of elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives wanting less high- handed treatment for\r\n\r\ntheir illiterate, ill educated constituents, things have\r\n\r\nimproved. But they can improve only so far as the general\r\n\r\nlevel of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconduct and courtesy between our citizens can improve. I\r\n\r\nhave known of communities where people are elaborately\r\n\r\ncourteous to each other because of the nature of long years\r\n\r\nof cultivated breeding, cultivated nurturing of good public\r\n\r\nbehaviour. Words like \"I am sorry\" or \"please\" are not\r\n\r\nsomething one hears over the telephone. They are \"What?\".\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" And if you say. \"Sorry, it is the wrong\r\n\r\nnumber\", they say. \"Oh!\", not \"I am sorry\". But what an\r\n\r\nabsolute waste of time that you should be the person\r\n\r\nanswering. If you are wrong, you should not be there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have picked up the telephone and have had to deal with\r\n\r\ntelephone operators who did not know who I was and treated\r\n\r\nme just like a member of the public. So I have a fair idea\r\n\r\nof the general level of public conduct. But they pick it up\r\n\r\nfirst at home, then the neighbourhood, their friends, then\r\n\r\nin the school reinforced by fellow students and teachers,\r\n\r\nthen out where they work, their friends, their bosses and\r\n\r\nthe people they meet and frequent and are together with.\r\n\r\nThis is a slow and painful process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, you can have the very converse where you have\r\n\r\nall the manifestations of good behaviour but actually a\r\n\r\ncrude vicious inner self. I have known of capitals in this\r\n\r\nworld where, having nudged you out of the bus queue - this\r\n\r\nwas 20 or 30 years ago when I was a student - they say.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me.\" They give you a sharp nudge and they are on,\r\n\r\nand you are off, the bus. They say. \"I am sorry\". They have\r\n\r\nall the external manifestations of a cultured well-bred\r\n\r\nperson. Which would you have? An honest straightforward\r\n\r\nSingaporean who says. \"No\", \"What\". \"Who is there?\" or a\r\n\r\nhypocritical one who says. \"I am terribly sorry,\" when he\r\n\r\nis not. The Member for Katong should think these things\r\n\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Unit in my office, it is a difficult business\r\n\r\nidentifying talent. Why Division I? Because that is more\r\n\r\nthan I want to handle. The PSC, together with the\r\n\r\nEstablishment Branch of the Ministry of Finance, will look\r\n\r\nafter everything. But an urgent situation has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narisen to spot talent at the top. I do not agree with the\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Blangah that the Ministries are\r\n\r\nunderstaffed. They say that they are understaffed because\r\n\r\nthis is Parkinson's law. Every Permanent Secretary says\r\n\r\nthat there should be so many Deputy Secretaries, so many\r\n\r\nheads of departments.\r\n\r\n-    and so on. A manpower survey conducted by the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Unit shows that the public sector is taking too\r\n\r\nmany engineers and other professionals as against the\r\n\r\nprivate sector, and that we should do with less. And if\r\n\r\nthere are efficient men, the right people to do the right\r\n\r\njobs, then we will not only do with less but we will do\r\n\r\nbetter with less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may read an extract from the circular which was\r\n\r\nsigned by the Head of the Civil Service. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Unit will be responsible for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) career development and training;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) postings, transfers and secondments;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) merit increment scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers likely to make the top superscale grades will\r\n\r\nhave postings to broaden their experience and test their\r\n\r\nmettle. There will be accelerated promotions whenever\r\n\r\nperformance matches the promise. This need to discover\r\n\r\noutstanding ability and administrative talent has become\r\n\r\npressing because of the void in numbers of able officers\r\n\r\nin the 30 to 45 age group caused by many promising\r\n\r\nofficers leaving to join the private sector in the years\r\n\r\nof rapid economic growth.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very painstaking business, trying to spot the\r\n\r\ndifference between ordinary pebbles and a gem on the beach.\r\n\r\nA gem before it is polished is often indistinguishable. But\r\n\r\nif one looks closely and long enough, picks up the right\r\n\r\none even if it is one in five and the wastage in testing is\r\n\r\nfour out of five -putting a person to trials to see whether\r\n\r\nhe comes up with the right answer, whether he is\r\n\r\nimaginative, he is creative, he has got the right approach,\r\n\r\nhe has got the decisiveness; once he has made up his mind,\r\n\r\nhe has got the stamina to pursue his recommendations to\r\n\r\nfruition - then even if it is the right one out of 10, I\r\n\r\nthink we are lucky. Whether it is in the civil service or\r\n\r\nwhether it is in the political side of Government, the\r\n\r\nproblem has always been that the more able the person is,\r\n\r\nthe more the workload is put on him in order that the job\r\n\r\ngets done. Perhaps the Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor Katong was giving unwitting praise to the few. They\r\n\r\ncarry an enormously disproportionate burden of the load\r\n\r\nbecause they have been found to be reliable and able to get\r\n\r\nthings done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Anson. I am not interested in\r\n\r\nwhether an officer has got a BA.. MA.. Ph.D., or D.Sc. Can\r\n\r\nhe get a job done? Can he get a team to work with him? Is\r\n\r\nhe a talker or a thinker, or a talker and a doer? The best,\r\n\r\nof course, is the man who thinks before he expounds and\r\n\r\nhaving expounded he then acts. But at the end of it all are\r\n\r\nthe results. It has got nothing to do with whether he has\r\n\r\ngot a Ph.D, or a School Certificate or even a Std. VI\r\n\r\nqualification. In the old days, Std. VI would have taken\r\n\r\nyou very far. It is whether you have got this up here and\r\n\r\nwhether you have got that drive. But the chances are, with\r\n\r\nour methods of universal education and selection all along\r\n\r\nthe way, race after race, year after year, if you cannot\r\n\r\nmake a simple BA., then it is hardly likely that you will\r\n\r\nbe able to last the marathon. And that is what we are\r\n\r\nlooking for - people who can last the pace, not just one\r\n\r\ntest but having passed it he will have three or four more\r\n\r\nquickly passed on to him. Every Minister can testify that\r\n\r\nwhen you discover such a person, then a large section of\r\n\r\nyour Ministry and its problems are taken off your shoulders\r\n\r\nand you get happy reports every month; and after a while\r\n\r\nevery three months, and after a longer while you begin to\r\n\r\ntake reports only once in six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have made my position clear. We are the\r\n\r\npolitical side of the Service. I do not defend rudeness. I\r\n\r\ndo not defend arrogance. I do not defend mediocrity. I do\r\n\r\nnot defend the desire to do the minimum and get by. But\r\n\r\nthis is what we have got. This is after 17 years of PAP\r\n\r\ngovernment. I think it could have been better, but it may\r\n\r\nhave been a lot worse. In fact, let us start off in the\r\n\r\nknowledge that it is better and let us make it better. But\r\n\r\nto make it better, let us not come here with any scales\r\n\r\nover our eyes. True MPs must make some noise for querulous\r\n\r\nconstituents. But it is extremely difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen the answer is \"No\", to make a member of the public go\r\n\r\naway happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as MPs know and even as Ministers know, some fellow\r\n\r\nMinisters have the habit of passing on the buck. So the MP\r\n\r\ncomes here and passes on the buck to the Minister. I have\r\n\r\ngot a lot of experience with that. I get Ministers passing\r\n\r\non the buck to each other and they land up on my plate.\r\n\r\nFinally, the answer is still \"No\", because if you say \"Yes\"\r\n\r\nthen you have changed the rules for everybody and an\r\n\r\nunworkable situation is created. So the man who knows how\r\n\r\nto say \"No\" and keep his constituents happy and have them\r\n\r\nvoting for him at the next elections should quietly\r\n\r\ncongratulate himself either at his innate good nature that\r\n\r\nGod has endowed him with or for his cultivated sense of\r\n\r\nself-discipline that keeps the face in relaxed and happy\r\n\r\ncountenance, while he is really fed up to the teeth with\r\n\r\ntroublesome constituents. Whichever way it is. I hope all\r\n\r\nMPs will look after their constituents, keep them happy\r\n\r\neven when the answer is \"No\" because, as you know, if the\r\n\r\nanswer is \"Yes\" he would not be looking for the MP,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

But if you go right back to\r\n\r\n1955 when I was sitting opposite, you find that there were\r\n\r\nalways vacancies. If you want to be a General and everybody\r\n\r\nwants to be a General, you cannot be a General unless you\r\n\r\nhave got lots of troops - and I think all M Ps are familiar\r\n\r\nwith this. If you want to be a Brigadier, you must have a\r\n\r\nbrigade. If you want to have a brigade you must have three\r\n\r\nbattalions and that means you must have three CoIonels.

In the\r\n\r\nfirst instance, the $10 provision for Head of the Anti-Pollution Unit needs explanation. I am sure Members will\r\n\r\nnot disagree with me when I say that this is an important\r\n\r\nUnit. Assurance has already been given by the Minister of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState in the Prime Minister's Office in reply to my remarks\r\n\r\nas contained in Hansard, Vol. 31, column 708. I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Unit is taking every effort to ensure that the air\r\n\r\naround us is pollution free, so that our people can lead a\r\n\r\nhealthy life wherever they may live.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that two years have passed with a token\r\n\r\nprovision of $10 for each year. I was just wondering\r\n\r\nwhether there is anybody suitable to take charge of this\r\n\r\nparticular Unit. In my last question to the Minister of\r\n\r\nState in the Prime Minister's Office, I notice that three\r\n\r\nofficers were sent overseas. It therefore certainly looks\r\n\r\nstrange to me that this Unit is still without a Head to\r\n\r\ndirect and coordinate anti-pollution measures, although\r\n\r\nthere are already so many officers around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to draw the attention of the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister to is the question of pollution caused by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of the Environment itself. I refer to the\r\n\r\nTampines Refuse Dumping ground which is situated near the\r\n\r\nestuary of the Serangoon River. The area around the swamp\r\n\r\nis being dumped with trade refuse from the city and garbage\r\n\r\nfrom the many residential estates. During spring tides, the\r\n\r\nwater comes right up to the mouth of the river, and when it\r\n\r\nrecedes, rubbish and refuse are simply washed into the\r\n\r\nstraits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is the question of lorries of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof the Environment. They carry stinking watery wastes which\r\n\r\ndrip along the road, whilst lorries carrying sand are\r\n\r\nusually parked by the road side to make sure that they\r\n\r\nconform with the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

The\r\n\r\nincumbent is presently the Acting Permanent Secretary of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of the Environment, but his salary is paid out\r\n\r\nof the Ministry's vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for pollution by the Ministry itself, it is the\r\n\r\npractice now to build a bund on the side of the Serangoon\r\n\r\nRiver, so that as little\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrubbish as possible goes into the river. But I agree with\r\n\r\nthe Member that when there is high tide there is some\r\n\r\npollution in the river. The Member will be happy to know\r\n\r\nthat the construction of the new incinerator at Ulu Pandan\r\n\r\nwill reduce the pollution in Punggol. This incinerator is\r\n\r\nscheduled to be completed in 1979 or 1980. It will have\r\n\r\nelectrostatic precipitators to minimise air pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to lorries which carry rubbish. I agree that sometimes\r\n\r\nwater trickles down. Most of the lorries are new ones. They\r\n\r\nare compact and no water flows out. We have about 70 old\r\n\r\nlorries which are still in use, and on rainy days when the\r\n\r\nrubbish is wet it trickles from the back and produces a\r\n\r\nterrible stench. But we are in the process of getting rid\r\n\r\nof these lorries. I do not want to blame the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance, but with more money we can get rid of the old\r\n\r\nlorries.

Through\r\n\r\nnational service we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave been able to improve our security and enhance defence\r\n\r\ncapability and social stability. We can talk of the many\r\n\r\nadvantages of national service in relation to our defence.\r\n\r\nThere are hardly any shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recalling the day when national service was first\r\n\r\nimplemented, many of us were worried because most parents\r\n\r\nat that time did not quite understand the significance of\r\n\r\nnational service. Because of their traditional belief, the\r\n\r\nparents tried to prevent their children from joining the\r\n\r\ncombat units of the national service. During that period\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Defence was beset with difficulties and the\r\n\r\nMinister himself had to crack his head to solve such\r\n\r\nproblems, and his hair turned gray because of it. However,\r\n\r\nafter some time parents gradually came round to accept the\r\n\r\nprinciples and need for a full-time national service for\r\n\r\nour young people. Some parents would not like to see their\r\n\r\nchildren being drafted into full-time national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there has been a change now. Many parents would\r\n\r\noffer all sorts of excuses to get their children\r\n\r\ntransferred to part-time national service when they are put\r\n\r\ninto full-time national service. If their application is\r\n\r\nnot approved they will be dissatisfied and disappointed. I\r\n\r\nthink we must do something to stamp out such tendency,\r\n\r\nbecause this will affect the young people in the national\r\n\r\nservice. Most of these parents are from the lower strata\r\n\r\nand are not well educated. They are farmers, fishermen,\r\n\r\nworkers and widows. The youngsters who come from such\r\n\r\nfamilies should join the full-time national service because\r\n\r\nsuch experience will be useful to them in future. However,\r\n\r\nthey cannot recognize the usefulness of full-time national\r\n\r\nservice. I do not understand what is the reason for this.\r\n\r\nPerhaps something has gone wrong in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nDefence, or perhaps the parents are prejudiced. I would ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister whether he is aware that more and more parents\r\n\r\nare applying for a transfer of their children to do part-time national service. Is there any measure to stop such a\r\n\r\ntendency or will these parents be allowed to apply for a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntransfer of their children to do part-time national\r\n\r\nservice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in regard to the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence I would like to raise three questions.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the high accident rate incurred by drivers and\r\n\r\nmobile riders was a matter of great concern in the SAF\r\n\r\nsometime ago. Every possible step was taken to raise\r\n\r\ndriving standards. To promote offence-free driving, an\r\n\r\noutright bonus of $50 was given to drivers/riders in full-time service who completed at least 2.500 miles of offence-free driving within a three-month period. May I know how\r\n\r\nthis incentive has improved the standard at driving in the\r\n\r\nArmy? To-date how many instructors have qualified for this\r\n\r\nbonus?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly. Sir, some students who come from not-so-well-off families have been granted scholarships by foreign\r\n\r\ncountries. These scholarships are not easily obtained. But\r\n\r\nthen after getting it, their parents find it difficult to\r\n\r\nsend them abroad because of the minimum $30,000 deposit\r\n\r\nrequired as a guarantee that the student will return to do\r\n\r\nnational service. How are these poor people going to raise\r\n\r\nsuch a big sum of money? It is not easy to raise it, and\r\n\r\nbecause of this some of these students have to forgo their\r\n\r\nscholarships. I know of one instance where the number of\r\n\r\nscholarships granted per year by a foreign country to local\r\n\r\nstudents has been reduced because of this requirement. May\r\n\r\nI suggest to the Minister to relax this requirement for the\r\n\r\npoor students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, the Government has put emphasis on rules\r\n\r\nabout long hair and pinched-up caps among our recruits. Yet\r\n\r\nit seems to be a common practice among some national\r\n\r\nservicemen particularly those attached to the Police Force,\r\n\r\nto keep long hair and even put on tiny caps over their big\r\n\r\nheads. Even some of the senior officers are sporting long\r\n\r\nhair, both in the Army and the Police Force. How are they\r\n\r\ngoing to control their subordinates? It is time a check was\r\n\r\nmade on all these recruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to touch on a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimilar subject of safe driving by Mindef drivers. I am\r\n\r\ninterested to know what programmes are afoot to improve the\r\n\r\ndriving standards of these Mindef drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, I am in sympathy with what the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang has said. As far as possible, the policy is moving\r\n\r\nin the direction he recommends, that is, enlist everybody.\r\n\r\nIn the past, of course, it was not possible to do so\r\n\r\nbecause there was limited requirement for manpower. But\r\n\r\nlately Government has decided that national servicemen can\r\n\r\nbe enlisted to do full-time national service in the Police,\r\n\r\nthe Fire Brigade, as well as the Vigilante Corps. I do not\r\n\r\nexpect that in future there should be much difficulty over\r\n\r\nthis. But it is not possible to insist that every youth\r\n\r\ndoes full-time national service because there are cases\r\n\r\nwhere genuine hardship will be caused by doing so. That is\r\n\r\nthe only ground on which we can allow deferment from\r\n\r\nnational service. Parents who feel that economic hardship\r\n\r\nwill be caused by national service call-up can make an\r\n\r\nappeal to the Appeals Board where cases are fully\r\n\r\ninvestigated, and in a fair number of instances appeals are\r\n\r\nallowed, something like 30% of applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding national service drivers, in my view they are a\r\n\r\nmuch maligned group. We have been keeping records of\r\n\r\naccident rates over the years and the figures show that in\r\n\r\nthe last few years there have been 2.5 accidents per\r\n\r\n100,000 kilometres travelled. Accident is defined to\r\n\r\ninclude cases where the fault is not with the Army drivers\r\n\r\nalone but with the civilian drivers also. A study of Police\r\n\r\nreports shows that in all accidents involving Army and\r\n\r\ncivilian drivers, the blame lies equally with the civilian\r\n\r\ndrivers as with Army drivers so that, in effect, as far as\r\n\r\naccidents due to Army drivers are concerned, the accident\r\n\r\nrate is something like just over one per 100.000\r\n\r\nkilometres. This is not a very high rate of accident\r\n\r\nconsidering that Army drivers on the average have just one\r\n\r\nyear's driving experience. We recruit more than 2.000\r\n\r\nnational service drivers each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand since they do two years' national service the average\r\n\r\nexperience is one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reduce the rate of accidents we have\r\n\r\nintroduced this bonus payment referred to by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson, whereby a driver gets $50 bonus if he has an\r\n\r\naccident-free record over three or four months. The matter\r\n\r\nis being reviewed because, although many drivers have\r\n\r\nqualified for this bonus and quite a large sum has been\r\n\r\npaid on this account, the accident rate remains about the\r\n\r\nsame as it was before the bonus was paid. I am afraid this\r\n\r\nprivilege may have to be withdrawn and other means found to\r\n\r\nimprove their driving standards. Perhaps stiffer penalties\r\n\r\nmay be more effective than the bonus payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On scholarships, the position is this. Where the\r\n\r\nscholarship is a genuine one granted under the auspices of\r\n\r\nthe Public Service Commission, then of course there is no\r\n\r\nquestion of paying any bond to ensure that the scholar\r\n\r\ncomes back to do his national service. Where it is a\r\n\r\nprivate scholarship, then the matter is referred to the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission to see whether it is really a\r\n\r\nmeritorious award or whether it is some kind of a fiddle,\r\n\r\nor whether in fact it is a minor kind of academic\r\n\r\ninstitution. If the PSC says. \"Yes, this is a good award\".\r\n\r\nthen of course no problem arises. However, if the PSC says.\r\n\r\n\"This kind of scholarship is humbug\", then the scholar is\r\n\r\nnot allowed to leave the country. He has to do his national\r\n\r\nservice first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On long hair, I cannot speak for the Police. But so far\r\n\r\nas the Army goes, nearly all battalion camps have a camp\r\n\r\nbarber and recruits are taken there on the first day and\r\n\r\nare charged 60 cents a hair cut. So far as the active\r\n\r\nbattalions are concerned, there are regular muster parades\r\n\r\nand I do not think there is a problem with national\r\n\r\nservicemen. However, once a soldier leaves the Army and\r\n\r\ngoes back to civilian life, he acquires all the bad habits\r\n\r\nof the civilian, including long hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days when reservists were called back for\r\n\r\ntheir annual in-camp training,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe officers were of course quite taken aback by a number\r\n\r\nof long hair styles, and they had to borrow barbers from\r\n\r\nseveral camps. But this did not work too well because camp\r\n\r\nbarbers gave them a 4 x 2 Army-style haircut and there were\r\n\r\nhowls of anguish from the reservists, some of whom claimed\r\n\r\nprobably with justification that they needed long hair\r\n\r\nbecause they were fashion designers or this and that. So\r\n\r\nmorale in that battalion camp dropped very low and we had\r\n\r\nto consider what options were available. One, of course,\r\n\r\nwas to treat every case on its own merits. That was not\r\n\r\npossible in the Army. Either they all wore the same kind of\r\n\r\nhair style, or sent to the camp barber, or not at all. So\r\n\r\nin the end we decided that so long as a reservist has a\r\n\r\ndecent haircut, in accordance with the photograph put up by\r\n\r\nRTS, he is allowed to carry on. Longer than that, he goes\r\n\r\nto the camp barber and he has to pay 60 cents for his\r\n\r\nhaircut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is, however, in between the annual in-camp\r\n\r\ntraining what do they do? They have to report once a month\r\n\r\nto their Reserve battalion headquarters and, of course,\r\n\r\ntheir hair could be quite long on those occasions. If they\r\n\r\nturn up in uniform, they give the Army a bad impression. So\r\n\r\nthe way out is to allow them to come in civies and thereby\r\n\r\navoiding some of the criticisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as long hair is concerned, we are trying to\r\n\r\ncontrol it as best as we can, and we have been successful\r\n\r\nin the active battalions. But for the reservists there must\r\n\r\nbe some give-and-take and within that situation we are\r\n\r\ndoing as well as we can,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Sir, on a\r\n\r\npoint of clarification. If my memory serves me right. I\r\n\r\nthink the Minister's announced policy on deferment from\r\n\r\nfull-time national service is that only the sole\r\n\r\nbreadwinner of the family will be exempted. I believe he\r\n\r\nmade that statement in this particular House. But what he\r\n\r\nsaid earlier on does seem to suggest that there could be\r\n\r\nsome change in the consideration of application for\r\n\r\nexemption from full-time national service. Would the\r\n\r\nMinister please clarify that point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would also like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether he would consider exempting construction workers\r\n\r\nfrom full-time national service. We are still not getting\r\n\r\nenough of this type of workers, and the majority of them\r\n\r\nare work permit holders. For those who work in high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings, I think the hazards that they are exposed to are\r\n\r\nsurely much greater than in the national service. So if\r\n\r\nthey are prepared to take a more hazardous job. I feel that\r\n\r\nwe should give them the deferment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not think there is a contradiction\r\n\r\nbetween what I say now and what I said the last time. The\r\n\r\nsole breadwinner would be exempted naturally because if he\r\n\r\nis called up for national service then there is economic\r\n\r\nhardship. But it does not work Out as simple as that. For\r\n\r\ninstance, if the sole wage earner in the family cannot\r\n\r\nprove that he earns much more than what he will earn in the\r\n\r\nArmy, then there is no hardship in calling him up for\r\n\r\nnational service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point about construction workers, they do\r\n\r\nnot qualify for exemption.

After\r\n\r\nthat he does his apprenticeship training for two years or\r\n\r\nfour years, at the end of which he comes back for his\r\n\r\nreservist training in the PDF battalion where he does the\r\n\r\nmore simple military chores. But I do not think it is\r\n\r\nfeasible to disrupt national service on grounds of working\r\n\r\nin the construction industry. Once you allow that, the\r\n\r\nquestion is: just where do we stop? Apart from that, it is\r\n\r\na very rare Singaporean who wants to work in the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry. Most of these tough jobs are now, I\r\n\r\nbelieve filled by work permit holders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> If it is such a rarity, surely they\r\n\r\nshould all be allowed deferment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Since the Minister has\r\n\r\nbeen very sympathetic in his answer, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum to be allocated for Head K be reduced by $10\r\n\r\nin respect of subhead AAA 1105.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the vote for the Ministry of Defence\r\n\r\nthis year is $650 million, an increase of $10 million over\r\n\r\nthat for last year. Defence takes up the second largest\r\n\r\nshare of expenditure of the whole Government Budget. There\r\n\r\nis no doubt that it is necessary to allocate a large sum of\r\n\r\nmoney for our defence, because we must build up our defence\r\n\r\non a sounder and more secure footing. All the basic\r\n\r\nfacilities should be adequate and sophisticated enough to\r\n\r\nensure that our defence credibility is satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this I would like to put forward certain\r\n\r\ncomplaints about certain defects which exist in the daily\r\n\r\nadministration in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore Armed Forces so that the Minister could take\r\n\r\nmeasures to rectify the shortcomings. Before I do so. I\r\n\r\nwould like to congratulate the Minister on the fact that.\r\n\r\nover the past year from my contacts with members of the\r\n\r\npublic. I have found that national servicemen and their\r\n\r\nparents are generally quite satisfied with life in the SAF\r\n\r\ncamps. The bad behaviour of some members of the SAF, for\r\n\r\nexample, whistling at girls on the roadside, has lessened.\r\n\r\nThere were very few such complaints against national\r\n\r\nservicemen. There is a marked improvement in their\r\n\r\ndiscipline. However. I have some questions to ask:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question relates to what has been done to\r\n\r\npromote and strengthen the national consciousness and\r\n\r\npatriotism of our national servicemen. This is an important\r\n\r\naspect of our objective because Singapore is a newly\r\n\r\nindependent country. After a decade of independence we have\r\n\r\nto see that such patriotism and national consciousness are\r\n\r\ninculcated in our national servicemen. In addition to\r\n\r\nmilitary training and learning of discipline, I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether such patriotism and national consciousness form\r\n\r\npart of their training. Are these values being consistently\r\n\r\ntaught to our national servicemen as part of their training\r\n\r\nor as a kind of indoctrination? However, from what I have\r\n\r\nunderstood up till now, the only two activities are\r\n\r\nrecreation and sports which are popular in the military\r\n\r\ncamps. With regard to subjects like ideological training, I\r\n\r\nwonder whether such relevant topics are taught to our\r\n\r\nnational servicemen. This is important because it will\r\n\r\nnurture their patriotism and boost their morale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard criticisms levelled against our national\r\n\r\nservicemen that they are reluctant to undergo military\r\n\r\ntraining and that they are eager to be discharged from the\r\n\r\nnational service. If that is the case, it means that the\r\n\r\nSAF has not done well in the field of education and that\r\n\r\nour national servicemen have not realised the significance\r\n\r\nof national service. I, therefore, hope that the SAF will\r\n\r\ngive due regard to this aspect of their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that some national servicemen have\r\n\r\nbeen indulging in undesirable habits. I have received such\r\n\r\ncomplaints from parents and I have also knowledge of\r\n\r\ncertain cases. It appears that certain boys who had good\r\n\r\nclean habits before their enlistment quickly took to\r\n\r\ndrinking and smoking as soon as they were drafted into the\r\n\r\nnational service, to the great disappointment of their\r\n\r\nparents. I hope the Minister would order the SAF to ban\r\n\r\ndrinking and smoking among the national servicemen in the\r\n\r\nbarracks so that they would keep their good and clean\r\n\r\nhabits in and out of the cam PS,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly. I wish to refer to the possible reduction of the\r\n\r\nperiod of training for the reservists. I have received\r\n\r\ncomplaints from some parents that the requirement of\r\n\r\nreservists to undergo one month's training every year has\r\n\r\ncaused great inconvenience to those who are employed or in\r\n\r\nbusiness, because they had to leave their job or business\r\n\r\nas there were no adequate substitutes to fill their posts.\r\n\r\nIn order to help these reservists to solve their problems,\r\n\r\nI would urge the Minister to consider reducing the period\r\n\r\nof re-training, say, from one month to one week. I do not\r\n\r\nknow what the Minister would think of this suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly. I would like to touch on the question of\r\n\r\nraising the leadership qualities of the officers. At the\r\n\r\nbeginning of this year at an Officers' seminar the Minister\r\n\r\nemphasised that the officers should take on more\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. This was reported in page 3 of the S/n\r\n\r\nChew Jit Poh of 23rd January, 1976. The Minister pointed\r\n\r\nout that as officers they should adopt practical methods to\r\n\r\nsolve various problems and should not pass the buck. The\r\n\r\nMinister also disclosed that a system is being set up in\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Defence to evaluate as well as promote the\r\n\r\nleadership capabilities of the officers and their ability\r\n\r\nto carry out duties. I fully agree with the Minister in\r\n\r\nthis constructive measure. Only in this way can we be\r\n\r\nassured that the leadership qualities of the officers will\r\n\r\nconstantly be raised. The officers should exert their\r\n\r\nauthority in leadership and show off an image to be looked\r\n\r\nupon with respect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby the rank and file. In order to achieve this objective\r\n\r\nthe officers should not be capable only of giving orders to\r\n\r\ntheir subordinates but should try to be looked upon with\r\n\r\nesteem by their subordinates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a tragic incident occurred in the past in which\r\n\r\na soldier killed his superior officer. Whoever was to be\r\n\r\nblamed, the fact remains that this incident took place and\r\n\r\nit must have been due to some serious cause. What was the\r\n\r\ncause? Was it because of the incompetent leadership of the\r\n\r\nofficer, or because of his abuse of power, or was it\r\n\r\nbecause of the ferocity or viciousness of the soldier\r\n\r\nconcerned? I do not know. I believe all officers should\r\n\r\nlearn something from this incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also heard the reservists talking about life in\r\n\r\nthe camp. They talked about certain officers who impressed\r\n\r\nthem very much, and they have learned something useful from\r\n\r\nsuch officers. At the same time, they also talked about the\r\n\r\nbad behaviour of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome officers who used to lose their temper and find fault\r\n\r\nwithout any rhyme or reason, and accused them for not\r\n\r\npolishing their shoes well and dressing properly. The\r\n\r\nsoldiers had to put up with the bossiness of such officers.\r\n\r\nThe leadership of such officers is comparatively less\r\n\r\neffective. We should not only inculcate patriotism and\r\n\r\nnational consciousness among the rank and file but we\r\n\r\nshould also see that the leadership qualities of the\r\n\r\nofficers are raised so that our national servicemen may be\r\n\r\nmoulded into a good army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, many of my colleagues have touched on the\r\n\r\nnumerous traffic accidents involving SAF drivers. There was\r\n\r\nan accident the day before yesterday. A military truck\r\n\r\nfirst knocked down a car and then a lamp post, before it\r\n\r\nfinally crashed into a garden and rammed into another car\r\n\r\nin the garden. Such an accident is more thrilling and\r\n\r\nexciting than what we have seen in the films. I would like\r\n\r\nthe Minister to inquire into the cause for the frequent\r\n\r\noccurrence of such accidents. More care should be taken in\r\n\r\nselecting the drivers and training them properly. If the\r\n\r\ndrivers are not good or not careful, many people could be\r\n\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I reply very\r\n\r\nbriefly to the Member for Sembawang? If a lad at the age of\r\n\r\n18 has no feelings of patriotism when he joins the Army.\r\n\r\nthen it is quite impossible within two years to instil in\r\n\r\nhim any such decent feelings. Therefore, we make no attempt\r\n\r\nto do so. I think the Member for Sembawang should remember\r\n\r\nwhat Lenin said, because he is the master in transforming\r\n\r\nman's mind. He said if you want to make him a good\r\n\r\nCommunist, you must start on him at the age of six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for young men being reluctant to become national\r\n\r\nservice soldiers and not realising the importance of that.\r\n\r\nI am afraid there is very little choice. If they do not\r\n\r\nturn up when they are called for national service, then\r\n\r\nthey go to gaol. As for national servicemen having clean\r\n\r\nliving before they join the Army and developing bad habits\r\n\r\nafter that, well, maybe that might have happened. But it is\r\n\r\nmore likely that the parents are not aware what children\r\n\r\nthey have. Reservists are given make-up pay. If there is\r\n\r\nany inconvenience to the employers, then they can make an\r\n\r\napplication for a deferment of reservist training. As I\r\n\r\nhave said previously in this House, this was fully\r\n\r\nconsidered and applications are allowed when a case is\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, about good officers and bad officers. The Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang has said that an officer who insists that his men\r\n\r\nare clean and tidy and shine their boots, and so on, is a\r\n\r\nbad officer. In my view, he is a good officer. Good\r\n\r\nofficers are seldom liked by soldiers. But they are\r\n\r\nrespected and they are obeyed, and you therefore get a good\r\n\r\nfighting unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr P.\r\n\r\nGovindaswamy -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head K be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead BAA 1201.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

May I know what improvements are going to be\r\n\r\ncarried out in these hospitals, and how could these\r\n\r\nimprovements be felt when there is an acute shortage of\r\n\r\nmedical personnel at the moment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a shortage of doctors in many hospitals,\r\n\r\nand as a result doctors are overworked. At times this\r\n\r\naffects the necessary attention of many emergency cases,\r\n\r\nresulting in poor treatment of patients. If I may just\r\n\r\nquote a recent case. A school van carrying children from\r\n\r\nthe Serangoon Kindergarten was sending the children home in\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar. It skidded along Bartley Road and the children\r\n\r\nwere badly hurt. Two ambulances arrived around noon and\r\n\r\nsent the children to the Toa Payoh Hospital. At Toa Payoh\r\n\r\nHospital the children were not given immediate attention.\r\n\r\nThe badly injured children were given first aid treatment\r\n\r\nonly, while the other children with bad facial cuts.\r\n\r\nbruises, and one with a torn lip were not given attention.\r\n\r\nThey were left to be attended by an anaesthetist from the\r\n\r\nSingapore General Hospital. This medical officer did not\r\n\r\narrive till late in the evening. Finally at 6.30 p.m, one\r\n\r\nof the parents became worried and went to look for a\r\n\r\nsurgeon at a nearby hospital, namely, the Mount Alvernia\r\n\r\nHospital. The child was rushed to the hospital and an\r\n\r\nemergency operation was conducted to stitch the torn lip.\r\n\r\nBy that time it was too late as the tissues of the torn lip\r\n\r\nhad dried up and stitching was difficult. This clearly\r\n\r\nshows that experienced personnel and equipment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare not readily available for emergency cases. Something\r\n\r\nmust be done to make our General Hospital more efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, outpatient charges had been raised from $2 to $3.\r\n\r\nand now it is $4. I wonder whether this is reasonable?\r\n\r\nThere are times when medicines bought from private\r\n\r\ndispensaries or sin seh shops which cost less seem to be\r\n\r\nmore effective than those given in the hospitals. Why is\r\n\r\nthis so? I suggest that treatment in the hospitals should\r\n\r\nat least be worth the cost the people have to pay. Nobody\r\n\r\nwants to be sick. Sickness may befall on a person at any\r\n\r\nmoment. $4 may be a nominal charge to those who are earning\r\n\r\na very high income, But $4 can go a long way to those in\r\n\r\nthe lower income group. Furthermore, after the first visit\r\n\r\nin which a patient has to pay $4 he may be required to\r\n\r\nreturn for a further check-up. Each time he returns for a\r\n\r\ncheck-up, he has to pay $4 and it goes on until he is\r\n\r\ncompletely cured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt there is such a thing as a waiver of charges.\r\n\r\nBut how often is this given? How willing are the hospital\r\n\r\nauthorities to grant a waiver of charges to certain\r\n\r\npatients? It is quite pathetic to see people suffering\r\n\r\nbecause they are unable to pay their hospital charges. For\r\n\r\ninstance, recently an old lady who fractured her leg had to\r\n\r\ngo for an X-ray and was warded. She had to pay for medical\r\n\r\ntreatment, ward charges and a few other charges. The bill\r\n\r\ncame to quite an amount, so much so her children withdrew\r\n\r\nher from the hospital and did not send her back, simply\r\n\r\nbecause they could not afford to pay for the treatment any\r\n\r\nfurther. Moreover, the poor old lady had to be transferred\r\n\r\nfrom one daughter's house to another, never given a proper\r\n\r\ntreatment, because her children could not afford to pay it.\r\n\r\nCan the Minister reduce the medical charges for the poor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nSir, I am not aware of the accident, which the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson mentioned just now, involving school children who\r\n\r\nwere travelling in a bus. If he could give me particulars\r\n\r\nof the date and the time when they were taken to Toa Payoh\r\n\r\nHospital, I would be able to find out more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout the treatment that was given to the accident\r\n\r\nvictims. However, I can assure the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nthat it is not true that the Outpatients Unit at Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh Hospital is manned by an Anaesthetist. I must\r\n\r\nconfess that the Accident and Emergency units in the\r\n\r\nhospitals are not up to the standard that I would want\r\n\r\nthem to be, and currently my Ministry is undertaking\r\n\r\nan exercise to reform them. We have, in fact, sent\r\n\r\nthree persons abroad recently to study how emergency\r\n\r\noperations are carried out in other hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the cost of ward charges. I can\r\n\r\nassure the Member for Anson that there is always a\r\n\r\nsocial worker in the hospitals who looks into the home\r\n\r\nbackground of the patient. If the social worker finds\r\n\r\nthat such a person is unable to pay for the ward\r\n\r\ncharges or medical treatment charges, then it is quite\r\n\r\npossible for a petition to be made to the Medical\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superintendent who will refer it to the Ministry which\r\n\r\nwill, in turn, examine the application and, if\r\n\r\nnecessary, charge at a lower rate or even waive the\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I think it ought to be made quite clear\r\n\r\nthat the hospitals do cost the Ministry a very\r\n\r\nsubstantial sum of money and our job really is to\r\n\r\nteach the people of Singapore not to get into\r\n\r\nhospitals. In fact, I am thinking of a scheme whereby\r\n\r\npatients could be treated as outpatients at home\r\n\r\nrather than in hospitals, partly because of the\r\n\r\nincreasing cost of hospital charges and partly because\r\n\r\nit has been shown in other countries that more deaths\r\n\r\noccur through cross-infection at hospitals than if the\r\n\r\npatients had been treated as outpatients. Nonetheless,\r\n\r\nI like to assure the Member for Anson that the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health is not that inhumane as to impose a\r\n\r\nheavy penalty on very sick patients who deserve a\r\n\r\nwaiver of fees. If he can put up the case to me, we\r\n\r\ncan always look into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Ong Leong Boon.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quite often we hear of reports that some nurses in\r\n\r\nhospitals have been rude to patients. There are also\r\n\r\nallegations that some of them seem to order patients\r\n\r\naround, especially those in `C' class wards. On the other\r\n\r\nhand, what makes the nurses behave in this manner? Well, to\r\n\r\nsome extent, it could be that they themselves are not\r\n\r\ntreated in a proper manner by their superiors. So, under\r\n\r\nprovocation, with no peace of mind but with pressure of\r\n\r\nwork, the poor nurses may at times show their frustration\r\n\r\ntowards the patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints from nurses in the\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospitals that some of the Hospital Sisters and\r\n\r\nMatrons do not show any tact. They scold, shout or even ill-treat the nurses in the presence of visitors. As there is a\r\n\r\ndrastic shortage of staff, the nurses are overworked. They\r\n\r\nhave to do more than their daily assignments, and their\r\n\r\nmeal-times are very irregular. At times, the nurses have to\r\n\r\nwork longer than their normal working hours because the\r\n\r\nhanding over of duties to the next shift is not efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been occasions when the duty roster was\r\n\r\nchanged, causing inconvenience. A nurse turned up for the\r\n\r\nearly shift according to the roster. After working for a\r\n\r\nfew hours a last-minute change was made and she was told to\r\n\r\ngo back and to report again for the late shift for that\r\n\r\nday. In other words, the nurse reported for the 7 am, to 2\r\n\r\np.m, shift but was told to go back at 10 am, and to come\r\n\r\nback again for the night shift beginning at 9 p.m. She was\r\n\r\nnot compensated for the extra hours that she had put in,\r\n\r\nalthough she was promised. Some of them are told to do odd\r\n\r\njobs in the presence of visitors, thus degrading them or\r\n\r\nembarrassing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of the complaints. There are many\r\n\r\nother complaints but I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant to mention them here. However, I trust the Minister\r\n\r\nwill see that the nurses in the hospitals are treated well\r\n\r\nby their superiors and not bullied, so that the patients\r\n\r\nwill not suffer because of their frustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe a survey of all registered nurses and\r\n\r\nmidwives will be carried out by the Ministry very soon. The\r\n\r\ninformation is collected for the future planning of nursing\r\n\r\nmanpower in hospitals and outpatient clinics in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI wonder what will be the outcome of this survey but let us\r\n\r\nhope, that we can have better terms of service for our\r\n\r\nnursing staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Song):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, this House\r\n\r\nwill recall that in the 1973 and 1974 Budget. I voiced\r\n\r\nstrong reservations about the pathetic state of health of\r\n\r\nthe Health Ministry and its hospitals.' The then Minister,\r\n\r\nand subsequently his rather short-lived Minister of State,\r\n\r\nhad chosen mischievously to avoid the debate squarely and\r\n\r\ninstead performed cosmetic surgery to facelift a badly\r\n\r\nscarred Ministry. Now that the Ministry changes leadership\r\n\r\nafter eight lean years, doctors and patients are eagerly\r\n\r\nwaiting for the rain after the humid long hot summer. A new\r\n\r\nMinister brings new hope and expectation, and I have chosen\r\n\r\nto speak today confident that a new spirit of dynamism and\r\n\r\nenquiry is in motion. Rest assured that, doctors and nurses\r\n\r\nare amongst the most agreeable lot of homo sapiens, and our\r\n\r\npatients exemplarily patient and tolerant. We shall give\r\n\r\nthe new Minister plenty of time to settle down to his\r\n\r\nunenviable job of salvage and acute resuscitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that we in Singapore have the best doctor\r\n\r\npopulation ratio of 1: 1200 in South-east Asia. This\r\n\r\nmeasures creditably even against the advanced countries in\r\n\r\nthe West. Our patient-care is fairly good, though it is\r\n\r\nadmittedly a long way from ideal. It is also true that\r\n\r\nincreasing numbers of Malaysians. Indonesians and even\r\n\r\nWesterners have come here for medical care\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaking Singapore, in the words of a certain Minister. \"the\r\n\r\ncentre of medical excellence in South-east Asia\". We have\r\n\r\nnever ceased to publicise Singapore's pre-eminence in\r\n\r\nmedical standards in this part of the world and the medical\r\n\r\nprofession will continue to promote and organise\r\n\r\ninternational conferences, seminars, and meetings for the\r\n\r\nadvancement of medical knowledge and expertise. Singapore\r\n\r\nis generally well regarded for the quality and standard of\r\n\r\nits doctors, specialists and medical services. Unlike\r\n\r\ndoctors from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, our doctors are\r\n\r\naccorded instantaneous full registration in the United\r\n\r\nKingdom and other parts of the Commonwealth. Patients going\r\n\r\nto China in the past few years with blind faith seeking\r\n\r\ncure with the acupuncturists were sadly disappointed and\r\n\r\nreferred back to us for medical attention. Chinese medicine\r\n\r\nis no magic formula. We take great pride in our medical\r\n\r\nschool which is 71 years of age today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in the entire medical set-up in Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday there is an all-pervading mood of disaffection, and\r\n\r\nrestlessness among the doctors, dental surgeons, nurses and\r\n\r\neven ancillary Division IV staff. The attitude has\r\n\r\nregrettably become one of \"if-you-can't-stick-it, hang it.\"\r\n\r\nInstitutional practice has today become a stepping stone to\r\n\r\nprivate practice. Worse still, and this demands urgent\r\n\r\nattention, increasing numbers of doctors and specialists\r\n\r\nemigrate to Australia, New Zealand. Canada. United States\r\n\r\nand the U.K, seeking greener pastures. It is not enough for\r\n\r\nus in the political leadership to say \"good luck, bon\r\n\r\nvoyage and May God Bless You\". It is neither correct for us\r\n\r\nto just throw stones at these professional people and label\r\n\r\nthem as \"quitters\". Why should this sorry state be so?\r\n\r\nSurely Hippocrates oath, which every medical student takes\r\n\r\non admission to the University, is not entirely lost. Has\r\n\r\nthe medical profession shunned the lofty heights of a\r\n\r\nsacrifice and selflessness and the noble profession of all\r\n\r\nvirtue and-no vice? I believe. Sir, many factors\r\n\r\ncontributed to this sick malaise. I am confident that our\r\n\r\nleaders are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngenerally aware of the problems facing the medical service.\r\n\r\nI feel, however, that notwithstanding the above, the\r\n\r\nMinistry's prescriptions to tackle the issues will remain\r\n\r\nhaphazard and ineffective as long as the medical service\r\n\r\nremains a low priority on the Cabinet's abacus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore was re-zoned into four catchment areas to\r\n\r\nalleviate pressure on the Singapore General Hospital. After\r\n\r\nalmost a year in operation, demand on the Singapore General\r\n\r\nHospital remains high. It is hoped that with time the\r\n\r\nperipheral hospitals will assume a greater load of patient-care. A new Singapore General Hospital costing, in all.\r\n\r\nsome $200 million is under construction to replace the old\r\n\r\nOutram Road General Hospital. A new Teaching Hospital at\r\n\r\nKent Ridge is on the planning board, costing, many millions\r\n\r\nmore. I would like to ask the Hon. Minister what his plans\r\n\r\nare to staff these large hospitals. No doubt more doctors.\r\n\r\nspecialists, dental surgeons, pharmacists, nurses and\r\n\r\nancillary staff are needed. Otherwise we shall be spending\r\n\r\nhundreds of millions of dollars to erect gigantic white\r\n\r\nelephants. The Teaching Hospital in a neighbouring country\r\n\r\nis a constant reminder that impressive, expensive hospitals\r\n\r\ncan be built given the money, but finding the required\r\n\r\nnumber of doctors and other staff to run them is to me an\r\n\r\nentirely different proposition. To me a happy doctor in a\r\n\r\ncow-shed is more productive than a grumbling stethoscope\r\n\r\nbehind four great walls, and a smiling nurse who calls her\r\n\r\npatients first names in a small unassuming hospital is more\r\n\r\ntherapeutic than that pompous touch-me-not impersonal\r\n\r\ncreature on two legs that patrol the corridors of imposing\r\n\r\ninstitutions - all morning glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the then Minister proudly proclaimed that only\r\n\r\n90-plus doctors resigned from the service while 110 joined\r\n\r\nmaking a net gain of doctors in the Ministry of Health. To\r\n\r\nme this is a very naughty reply from a clever politician.\r\n\r\nHe omitted the breakdown analysis of these figures in terms\r\n\r\nof experience, qualification and training. May I humbly\r\n\r\nsubmit that 90 captains leaving and 110 captains joining\r\n\r\nthe SAF is quite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent from 90 captains leaving and 110 recruits joining\r\n\r\nthe SAF. What are the figures for doctor resignations this\r\n\r\nyear? How many doctors and specialists have emigrated to\r\n\r\nother countries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drew the attention of this House to the high proportion\r\n\r\nof non-citizens in the medical school two years ago. In a\r\n\r\ngraduating class of about 120 last year some 50% were non-citizens and today in our hospitals we have an acute\r\n\r\nshortage of housemen. This situation will continue unless\r\n\r\nmeasures are taken with haste to encourage more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to study medicine, I shall be most grateful if\r\n\r\nthe Hon. Minister could provide figures to show that\r\n\r\ncorrective measures have been taken to ensure a continuing\r\n\r\nsupply of new doctors to run our hospitals. As I have\r\n\r\nmentioned before, non-citizen graduates of our medical\r\n\r\nschool are birds of passage: they have amply proven to be\r\n\r\nso: and they cannot be relied upon to man our hospitals.\r\n\r\nAre we then to recruit doctors from, say, the Indian sub-continent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation with dental officers is even more pathetic\r\n\r\nand appalling. Because few Singaporeans chose dentistry for\r\n\r\na profession, the Government instead of encouraging\r\n\r\nstudents to study dentistry opted to spend some $5 million\r\n\r\n~to train a corps of dental therapists. Each dental\r\n\r\ntherapist-in-training receives an allowance of about $300\r\n\r\nper month. I am amazed at this scheme. If only the same\r\n\r\nmoney were made available in the form of scholarship to\r\n\r\nstudents to take dentistry, I am confident there shall be\r\n\r\nin a few years increasing numbers of fully qualified dental\r\n\r\nsurgeons who are best trained to care for our nation's\r\n\r\ndental health. In the meantime Division II registered\r\n\r\ndentists and quacks are having a field day. I wonder how\r\n\r\nmany Members of this august Chamber can claim to have a\r\n\r\nfamily dental surgeon. Equally I wonder how many Members\r\n\r\npresent here this afternoon have lost salvageable teeth so\r\n\r\nnecessary for mastication, if not cosmesis by an\r\n\r\ninadvertent visit to a dental quack!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are so many doctors and dental surgeons unhappy?\r\n\r\nDoctors work long and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nirregular hours, frequently exceeding 100 hours a week.\r\n\r\nTheir work is exacting, seven days a week. A wrong\r\n\r\ndiagnosis, an inadequate resuscitation, an incomplete\r\n\r\nsurgical exploration, otherwise termed surgical\r\n\r\nmisadventure in the wee hours of the morning when this\r\n\r\nChamber and all Singapore are fast asleep, may end up in\r\n\r\nthe never-never territory of the inquisitive pathologist at\r\n\r\nthe mortuary. Patients and relatives rightly demand\r\n\r\ncourtesy, good manners and care even during odd hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked for a salary revision for doctors and dental\r\n\r\nsurgeons, and I am not satisfied with the mini-adjustments\r\n\r\nthat were made. The vast majority of medical officers have\r\n\r\nseen no change in terms of employment for more than 10\r\n\r\nyears. Of course, they receive NWC recommendations - who\r\n\r\nhas not in Singapore? The case of the housemen is a unique\r\n\r\nexercise in salary revision. The housemen got a salary\r\n\r\nadjustment from $750 to $850 per month last year after an\r\n\r\nunfortunate though abortive exercise of not reporting for\r\n\r\nwork on the first day. They thought initially they had won.\r\n\r\nInstead they discovered later that, in fact, they lost. The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health assisted by its clever lieutenants, the\r\n\r\nDirector of Medical Services and his Deputy Director, won.\r\n\r\nHow? Annual vacation for housemen was slashed from four\r\n\r\nweeks to two weeks. I am sure this House needs a lot of\r\n\r\npersuasion that the housemen got a pay rise. May I plead\r\n\r\nwith the Hon. Minister for fair play and fair reward for a\r\n\r\ngood day's work. Let us not play games. Let us not resort\r\n\r\nto Change Alley tactics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If doctors cannot be given a fair basic salary\r\n\r\ncommensurate with their work, then may I suggest they be\r\n\r\npaid overtime pay so that the civil service salary\r\n\r\nstructure need not be disturbed. This is a reasonable\r\n\r\nrequest and details can always be worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the U.K. last year there was tremendous dislocation of\r\n\r\nthe medical service when the National Health Service\r\n\r\ndoctors and hospital consultants went on strike or worked\r\n\r\nto rule in their fight for fair pay and service conditions,\r\n\r\nand I am sure our doctors here do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot wish to resort to silly industrial action in pursuit of\r\n\r\nfair play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago the then Health Minister reported to this\r\n\r\nHouse that 200 units of flats will be built for doctors\r\n\r\nworking in public hospitals. Today no further development\r\n\r\nis heard. I am reliably informed that the Ministry is still\r\n\r\nthinking about it -- one of several thoughts that hopefully\r\n\r\none day will see the light of dawn. Housing is a very\r\n\r\nserious problem not just for our doctors but for our young\r\n\r\nprofessionals and our middle income wage earners. It is one\r\n\r\narea that the Government can help and must help\r\n\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Institutional practice has definite and certain\r\n\r\nadvantages and opportunities such as training facilities.\r\n\r\nexperience and work satisfaction that private practice\r\n\r\ncannot offer. Few doctors would leave the serviie if they\r\n\r\ncan be kept reasonably happy at work. If they leave for\r\n\r\nprivate practice, it is more often than not, in pursuit of\r\n\r\nmoney. If this is so, then it is indeed a sad reflection on\r\n\r\nthe medical profession but sadder still it is a reflection\r\n\r\non the moneytheistic society that we have nurtured over the\r\n\r\nlast decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I think it is most unfair for me\r\n\r\nnot to take this opportunity to congratulate the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Health for its heart, led by the biggest heart of all.\r\n\r\nthe Hon. Minister for Health, especially after the Member\r\n\r\nfor Kim Seng's delivery. I heard tell that through the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister's intervention the breast-feeding mothers' group\r\n\r\nwas able to set up their third milk bank at the Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau Hospital to save sick and dying babies at the\r\n\r\nhospital who, without mother's milk, would have otherwise\r\n\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if we say that all\r\n\r\nour nurses are discourteous, it is not fair. Nevertheless I\r\n\r\nhave also received complaints about the incorrect attitude\r\n\r\nof some nurses. They are impatient and would not listen to\r\n\r\ncomplaints made by the patients. But, generally speaking.\r\n\r\nmost of our nurses are well-mannered. Our medical standards\r\n\r\nare very high because some foreigners who were treated in\r\n\r\nour hospitals got well very soon. And comparing the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfacilities in their hospitals, they say that our medical\r\n\r\nstandards are very high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Anson mentioned that some nurses\r\n\r\nwho were not treated well by their superiors would vent\r\n\r\ntheir grievances on the patients. I think this is possible,\r\n\r\nespecially those elderly nurses who have to allocate work\r\n\r\nto the other nurses. For -instance, on a Sunday the wards\r\n\r\ndo not need as many nurses, but they would nevertheless\r\n\r\nsend a great number of nurses to man the wards. If the\r\n\r\nMinister were to visit such wards, particularly in the\r\n\r\nMaternity Hospital, he would find such instances there. I\r\n\r\nthink this is one case that the Minister should give his\r\n\r\nattention to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain spinster nurses attached to the Family\r\n\r\nPlanning Unit. These nurses do not have their own families.\r\n\r\nSo if the Minister wants to promote family planning, I do\r\n\r\nnot think that it is proper to post spinster nurses to that\r\n\r\nUnit. They should not be asked to work in the Family\r\n\r\nPlanning and Population Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I am not quite sure\r\n\r\nwhat questions are being asked of me. However, to come to\r\n\r\nwhat the Member for Anson has said with regard to the\r\n\r\nbehaviour of nurses in our hospitals, I would like to say\r\n\r\nthat, by and large, I believe the nurses are doing their\r\n\r\nbest. I would like to ask any Member of this House whether\r\n\r\nhe would like to take on the job as a nurse and work on a\r\n\r\nnight shift and, probably with a wife waiting for him in\r\n\r\nthe house, to see whether he would be able to withstand all\r\n\r\nthe stresses and strains that are demanded of him without\r\n\r\nlosing perhaps his composure. That settles the complaint\r\n\r\nthat nurses are rude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have initiated a scheme in the Ministry whereby nurses\r\n\r\nare being encouraged to regard patients as human beings and\r\n\r\nnot just objects to be treated. Somebody has given us a sum\r\n\r\nof $10,000 and this has been deposited in the POSB. The\r\n\r\ninterest accrued will be used for merit awards to nurses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommended by the Medical Superintendent or the Heads of\r\n\r\nUnits. It will not be granted on the basis of patients\r\n\r\nvoting for the best nurse, because it is not possible to\r\n\r\nask a pediatric patient or a geriatric patient or a\r\n\r\nmentally unsound patient at Woodbridge Hospital to vote\r\n\r\nwhich nurse is the best nurse. Hence, we have to have a\r\n\r\nscheme which will allow some Unit Heads leeway to judge\r\n\r\nwhich nurses are performing their duty and more than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from receiving complaints that nurses are rude, I\r\n\r\nhave on the other hand received letters, and there have\r\n\r\nbeen letters written in the Chinese papers, commending on\r\n\r\nthe good behaviour of nurses. I have been very pleased and\r\n\r\nI have transmitted these letters to the Medical\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of the hospital concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe we are facing a situation where it is\r\n\r\nimpossible or difficult to recruit nurses. On the contrary,\r\n\r\nthe demand to enter the nursing profession is there and I\r\n\r\ncan assure the House that we will be able to tap the best\r\n\r\nof applicants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not the younger nurses are bullied by their\r\n\r\nsuperiors, that is a matter which I am not aware of. All I\r\n\r\nknow is that I visited a private hospital recently and when\r\n\r\nit was known that I was going to visit this private\r\n\r\nhospital, everything was made spick and span. The\r\n\r\nattendants and the nurses were alerted. Patients were given\r\n\r\nnew pyjamas and the Administration told me to come along\r\n\r\nagain another time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that sometimes the administration of a\r\n\r\nhospital can be slack. Because a hospital operates 24 hours\r\n\r\na day for 365 days a year, many of those working in the\r\n\r\nhospital - doctors, nurses and paramedical staff - sometimes, do take things for granted and that many of the\r\n\r\nroutine matters appear to them to be unimportant whereas\r\n\r\nthey are important to patients. I have emphasised to the\r\n\r\nMedical Superintendents that this point must be looked into\r\n\r\nand I hope to see a distinct improvement. The Member for\r\n\r\nKim Seng himself incidentally works in the General Hospital\r\n\r\nand so he should be in a position to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow whether there is any improvement or not., If he does\r\n\r\ncome across rude nurses, please do let me know and if he\r\n\r\ncomes across affectionate nurses, please also inform me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to emigration of doctors. I am afraid this is\r\n\r\na problem which is of concern to the Government. As such.\r\n\r\nwe did do a survey on doctors who were in Government\r\n\r\nservice, asking them the reasons for leaving the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Health. The first results which have been evaluated have\r\n\r\ncome in. The reasons given for leaving Government service\r\n\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n Higher income                              - 48.1%\r\n\r\n More job satisfaction                      - 25.5%\r\n\r\n Better working conditions                  -  5.2%\r\n\r\n More freedom                               -  6.7%\t\r\n\r\n Completion of contract or termination \r\n\r\n   of temporary appointment                 -  4.5%\r\n\r\n Other reasons\t                            - 10.0%\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So there are at least 48.1% of doctors who were honest\r\n\r\nenough to admit that they were leaving the Government\r\n\r\nservice because they could earn a higher income. I am just\r\n\r\nasking myself: how long is the Member for Kim Seng going to\r\n\r\nstay with the University too' I hope he does not let me\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact of life that doctors are mobile. At one\r\n\r\ndinner function I had occasion to meet the President of a\r\n\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons from the United Kingdom. I asked\r\n\r\nhim why did he study medicine instead of engineering, since\r\n\r\nhis country was in the forefront of the industrial\r\n\r\nrevolution and that engineers performed a dominant role in\r\n\r\npromoting economic growth in his country. His answer was\r\n\r\nvery simple: medicine is the most secure job. It means that\r\n\r\ndoctors can move about, particularly doctors in the English\r\n\r\nspeaking world. Singapore doctors are brought up in the\r\n\r\nEnglish language and so they are welcome to migrate to\r\n\r\nAustralia. Canada, the United Kingdom. New Zealand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the United States. It is a fact of life that many of\r\n\r\nour young graduates, while preparing for the final year for\r\n\r\nM,B.B.S., do go up to Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur to take the\r\n\r\nexternal examination conducted oy the American Council for\r\n\r\nForeign Medical Graduates, so that after they have\r\n\r\ngraduated they could put after their names \"M.B.B.S.,\r\n\r\nE.C.F.M.G.\". I am not sure whether the Member for Kim Seng\r\n\r\nhas done that, but he should know as he has lived in a\r\n\r\nhospital among the medical undergraduates, most of whom\r\n\r\nhave done this. This applies not just to the Malaysian\r\n\r\nundergraduates but also the Singapore graduates as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that we are critically short of doctors, I have\r\n\r\nno  hesitation to impose compulsory national  service  .for\r\n\r\nwomen  doctors, just as of this moment  male  doctors  are\r\n\r\nobliged  to undergo 2\ufffd years' national   service.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  national service doctors come under the  control  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health. Others are under the      Singapore\r\n\r\nArmed Forces. There is indeed a complaint about discrepancy\r\n\r\nbetween  the     treatment accorded to male  graduates  and\r\n\r\nfemale graduates and I give due notice that (it may  be  at\r\n\r\nsome  future date) I will make it compulsory for all  those\r\n\r\nwho have undergone an expensive medical education to return\r\n\r\nin  kind by performing similarly 2\ufffd years' service  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the recruitment, loss and establishment\r\n\r\nstrength  of doctors. I can provide figures for four  years\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Number of Doctors\r\n\r\n                         Resigned\r\n\r\n           Recruited     or Retired   Net Gain\r\n\r\n1972           61            59          2\r\n\r\n1973          144            61         83\r\n\r\n1974          119            87         32\r\n\r\n1975           90            74         16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fair to say that those whom we recruited were of\r\n\r\nmedical officer grade and many of them did not have a\r\n\r\nhigher or postgraduate medical qualification. Some of those\r\n\r\nwhom we lost did have seniority and specialist\r\n\r\nqualifications. In 1975. 13 Singapore citizen doctors with\r\n\r\na higher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nqualification and 42 without a higher qualification, had\r\n\r\nresigned. Among Malaysian citizen doctors, no one with a\r\n\r\nhigher qualification had resigned, but nine without a\r\n\r\nhigher qualification had resigned. One doctor from India\r\n\r\nwith a higher qualification had also resigned and there\r\n\r\nwere others too - one with a higher qualification and two\r\n\r\nwithout a higher qualification - who had resigned. I must\r\n\r\nconfess that it is not a good trade-off -losing an\r\n\r\nexperienced doctor and gaining inexperienced medical\r\n\r\nofficers. But we have to face the fact of life that many\r\n\r\ndoctors do make use of our hospitals and the University as\r\n\r\na stepping stone whereby they can acquire experience at\r\n\r\npublic expense and after some time they resign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was at the University it was very marked indeed\r\n\r\nthat the moment someone was promoted to an Associate\r\n\r\nProfessor, he was called \"Professor\" by his students and\r\n\r\npatients. In less than three years, most of them would\r\n\r\nresign. So knowing that this is the way doctors behave, I\r\n\r\nthink the remarks of the Member for Kim Seng should be\r\n\r\ndirected at his own colleagues and not to the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth who, after all, is trying his hardest to keep the\r\n\r\ndoctors. It is not in my position to go along and give them\r\n\r\nmore money. This is a prerogative of the Treasury which\r\n\r\nties salaries up to other professions. But if taxpayers are\r\n\r\nwilling to pay a special sum of money for better health\r\n\r\nservice, then we can suitably reward doctors, nurses and\r\n\r\nother para-medical staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Kim Seng were to go round and propagate\r\n\r\nhis idea that there should be a special health service tax.\r\n\r\nthen I think it is quite possible for us to retain our more\r\n\r\nsenior doctors so that they do not go into private practice\r\n\r\nor migrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live to regret what I said in a speech when I was at\r\n\r\nthe University - that Orchard Road was the Harley Street of\r\n\r\nSingapore. The end result was that \"specialist centres\"\r\n\r\npopped up all over the place. Orchard Road is bigger than\r\n\r\nHarley Street now. Anybody who has got a little cubicle in\r\n\r\nthe complex called the Specialist's Centre becomes a\r\n\r\nspecialist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Whether or not this helps the migration of doctors from the\r\n\r\npublic sector to the private sector is debatable. I thought\r\n\r\nI was boosting the morale of the doctors, but it turned out\r\n\r\nto the disadvantage of the Ministry of Health and the\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true that doctors are not stupid. They do read\r\n\r\ntheir newspapers. They follow political events in the\r\n\r\nregion and they know what has happened in Indo-China. When\r\n\r\na three-star General buzzes off to the United States, he\r\n\r\nbecomes either a taxi-driver or a waiter in a restaurant.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, ri you are a doctor and you migrate to\r\n\r\nthe United States you are wanted. I have my own forebodings\r\n\r\nthat a good number of our doctors in Singapore are\r\n\r\nregistered not only in Singapore but also registered\r\n\r\noverseas, because Australia. New Zealand and the United\r\n\r\nKingdom permit the registration of doctors even though\r\n\r\ntheir physical presence is not required in those countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember it was last year, just before the Australian\r\n\r\nGovernment announced the closure of its registry for\r\n\r\nmedical doctors, when I was told the story that SIA was\r\n\r\ncarrying Singapore doctors to Perth or Sydney and Qantas\r\n\r\nwas bringing them back, These are human failings and\r\n\r\ndoctors are not without their failings. I would be the last\r\n\r\nperson to say that doctors are \"Gods\". Although they are\r\n\r\nhealers, they do look after their own welfare as well. Let\r\n\r\nus be honest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng would be a good Political\r\n\r\nSecretary to me if he is willing to serve in my Ministry at\r\n\r\na salary of $1,750 per month. He can resign from his\r\n\r\npresent post in the University where he is probably getting\r\n\r\nmore than I can give. He can be my Political Secretary and\r\n\r\ndo a little campaigning on how to keep our doctors in the\r\n\r\nMinistry and in Singapore. It will not be a great loss as\r\n\r\nlong as these doctors stay and practise in Singapore. But\r\n\r\nit will be a loss when they migrate. It is a fact of life\r\n\r\nthat even Colombo Plan scholars who were sent abroad to\r\n\r\nstudy medicine, had paid up their bonds at substantial\r\n\r\nrates, $40,000 each, and just buzzed off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was responsible for trying to bring the establishment\r\n\r\nof the Medical Department in the University of Singapore to\r\n\r\nfull strength by changing the scheme of service in the\r\n\r\nUniversity, hoping to get better and brighter young doctors\r\n\r\nwilling to teach. But unfortunately not all of them have\r\n\r\nlived up to my expectation. Worse still, the seniors have\r\n\r\nset the bad example in that after promotion either to the\r\n\r\nprofessorship, associate professorship or even to senior\r\n\r\nlecturership, they would pack off within three years or so.\r\n\r\nThis is the answer to the Member for Kim Seng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the nurses, my sympathies are always with them.\r\n\r\nMind you, if you are a patient in a hospital, you see the\r\n\r\ndoctor only once in the morning. But the nurses see you for\r\n\r\n24 hours a day. If I were the Member for Anson, I would be\r\n\r\nvery careful when talking about the behaviour of the\r\n\r\nnurses, because they are going to look after me for 24\r\n\r\nhours a day. The doctor diagnoses the ailment and puts the\r\n\r\nstethoscope to your chest. The technician takes your\r\n\r\nelectrocardiogram. The doctor then prescribes the medicine\r\n\r\nand that is that. It is the nurses who give you the\r\n\r\nmedicine and the injection. It can be very painful\r\n\r\nsometimes if they inject you at the wrong place. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. Sir, I really do not know how to put my finger on\r\n\r\nthe particular problem that the Member for Anson or the\r\n\r\nMember for Kim Seng has raised,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one point raised by the Member for Kim Seng is about\r\n\r\ndental therapists. In China they have what they call \"bare-foot\" doctors. It is a very simple philosophy which is\r\n\r\nbeing practised in many developing countries, viz., make\r\n\r\nthe most use of whatever manpower resources you have. It is\r\n\r\nimpossible for a country with 800 million people to provide\r\n\r\nmedical services of the standard that we see in Western\r\n\r\ncountries. I do not see how China will ever have such large\r\n\r\nnumbers of Western-trained doctors to serve every commune\r\n\r\nin the countryside. Therefore, they have a short course of\r\n\r\nthree years for \"barefoot\" doctors after which they can\r\n\r\nprovide primary health care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same situation applies to Singapore, particularly to\r\n\r\ndentistry. I do not say that Division II dentists are\r\n\r\nquacks. By gosh! I have not yet been to a Division II\r\n\r\ndentist but my old amah used to go to a Division II dentist\r\n\r\nand she paid only $3 for a tooth extraction, If she had\r\n\r\ngone to a Division I dentist she would have to pay $30\r\n\r\nThere is an enormous difference in fees between going to a\r\n\r\nDivision I dentist and a Division II dentist. The dental\r\n\r\ntherapists that we are recruiting will come from the dental\r\n\r\nnurses who would have to have a minimum of five years'\r\n\r\nexperience after three years' training. Dental students who\r\n\r\ngraduate from the University of Singapore undergo a mere\r\n\r\nfour-year course of training, immediately after which, even\r\n\r\nwithout housemanship, they are allowed to treat patients by\r\n\r\nthemselves. On the other hand, dental therapists are not\r\n\r\npermitted to do so. Even after training for four years,\r\n\r\nthey need to have ten years' supervision by professionally\r\n\r\nqualified dentists before they are allowed to go on their\r\n\r\nown. Therefore, if a patient has to decide whether he\r\n\r\nwishes to be treated by an experienced person or by an\r\n\r\ninexperienced one, he would rather be treated by a person\r\n\r\nwho has the requisite experience. Much of the bread-and-butter of dentistry involves simple filling and extraction,\r\n\r\nDental therapists are not allowed to perform an operation\r\n\r\non the soft tissues. They are not allowed to do\r\n\r\northodontics whereas the professional dentists are allowed\r\n\r\nto do so.The difference is that dental therapists do not\r\n\r\nhave the two year-course of Higher School Certificate that\r\n\r\nthe University dentists have. All in all. I think it is\r\n\r\nvery unfair for the Member for Kim Seng, who has just\r\n\r\nreturned from London and who was not here when the Dentists\r\n\r\nRegistration (Amendment) Bill was passed, to give the poor\r\n\r\ndental therapists a bashing. We have got the first batch of\r\n\r\ndental therapists in the first year of training. They will\r\n\r\nnot pass out until after 1978. Even so, they would have to\r\n\r\nhave another 10 years' supervised experience before they\r\n\r\ncan be out on their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a mistake of the Ministry of Health to have\r\n\r\nallowed the Division II dentists'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregistry to run down. The end result is that dental\r\n\r\nassistants who had been hired by these dentists are finding\r\n\r\nthemselves out of job because their bosses have retired and\r\n\r\nthey have not been replaced. I know it because they have\r\n\r\nwritten to me. We have got to understand what exactly it is\r\n\r\nthat we are prepared to pay for. If the taxpayer in\r\n\r\nSingapore is prepared to pay a special levy for medical and\r\n\r\ndental services, then I would be fully in favour of\r\n\r\ncharging the taxpayer accordingly and give the service that\r\n\r\nhe is asking for. But the Member for Anson earlier on\r\n\r\ncomplained about the increase in hospital fees. Here, we\r\n\r\nhave a contradiction. On the one hand he wants a service\r\n\r\nand on the other hand he refuses to pay. You cannot have\r\n\r\nyour cake and eat it. Either you pay for what you consume\r\n\r\nor you do not consume because you cannot pay. Again, this\r\n\r\nis a problem which is being examined very closely in my\r\n\r\nMinistry apart from the other programmes which we hope to\r\n\r\nimplement within the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above all this. I would like to emphasise that\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health's primary function is probably less\r\n\r\ncurative and more on preventive medicine. The way to do it\r\n\r\nis to activate medical education for the man-in-the-street,\r\n\r\nso that he learns how not to fall sick and, therefore, how\r\n\r\nnot to go to the hospital. It is not necessary for a sick\r\n\r\nperson to be referred immediately to a hospital. There are\r\n\r\noutpatient dispensaries where doctors are well qualified to\r\n\r\nexamine the patients and the charge is only $3, including\r\n\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also said that the medicine\r\n\r\ndispensed by the hospitals is not effective whereas the\r\n\r\nmedicine dispensed by the Chinese sin sehs is effective. He\r\n\r\nrather shook me. If that is true, then I think we ought to\r\n\r\nclose down our hospitals and advise all patients to seek\r\n\r\nwhatever treatment is available in town. But I do not\r\n\r\nbelieve it is as simple as that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

But I am sure that not only myself\r\n\r\nbut other Members of the House are still not too happy with\r\n\r\nhis explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a reduction of 55 Division I posts in\r\n\r\nsubhead AAA 1111. I can reasonably assume that in the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health most of the Division I posts would be\r\n\r\nheld by doctors. If my presumption is correct, then the\r\n\r\nreduction in the posts of doctors is, to say the least, a\r\n\r\nlittle disturbing. Is the reduction provided for because\r\n\r\nthe Ministry is unable to fill the present establishment\r\n\r\nvacancies of 398 Division I officers? There have always\r\n\r\nbeen complaints of a shortage of doctors in Government\r\n\r\nhospitals. What is the position now? Why is there this\r\n\r\nreduction of 55 posts in subhead AAA 1111?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a shortage of doctors in the Government\r\n\r\nservice. It is, therefore, disturbing to note that so many\r\n\r\nqualified doctors are performing administrative ,functions\r\n\r\nin the Ministry of Health. Some of these doctors have been\r\n\r\ntrained at high cost, and many of them are specialists who\r\n\r\nare in short supply. It would be more appropriate to\r\n\r\nutilise these trained specialists and doctors in treating\r\n\r\nthe poor than to make them fill up forms, statistics,\r\n\r\nordering hospital equipment and other supervisory functions\r\n\r\nwhich could very well be performed by non-professional\r\n\r\nadministrative officers. I am told that in advanced\r\n\r\ncountries there are special courses for hospital\r\n\r\nadministrators who need not be qualified doctors. Could we\r\n\r\nalso not look forward to the day when our doctors will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployed only to cure the sick and not for filling up\r\n\r\nforms?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the complaints of doctors in the Government\r\n\r\nservice is that there are insufficient promotion prospects\r\n\r\nin our medical service. That is one of the `easons why many\r\n\r\ndoctors have resigned. Of course, the other main reason is\r\n\r\nthat they could hope to make more money in private\r\n\r\npractice. Although the Minister for Health mentioned that\r\n\r\n48.1% of our doctors have resigned because there is more\r\n\r\nmoney outside than in the public service, I believe the\r\n\r\nfigure could be much more than 48.1%. If money is the only\r\n\r\nreason for their leaving, it is deplorable to find that\r\n\r\ndedication to curing the sick is associated with the amount\r\n\r\nof money that can be made. Perhaps, there must be something\r\n\r\nwrong with our teachings in schools, or, more in the case\r\n\r\nof doctors, our teachings in the medical faculty of our\r\n\r\nUniversity. There have also been cases of our professional\r\n\r\npeople, doctors included, emigrating from Singapore. This\r\n\r\nwas accepted by the Minister just now. One begins to wonder\r\n\r\nif, in the University, whilst teaching medicine proper\r\n\r\nethics are also being taught with regard to saving I yes as\r\n\r\nwell as the social obligation to the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwho foot the bulk of the bill of the School of Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints of lack of promotion prospects are genuine and\r\n\r\nyet under BAA 1106, the Senior Physician, Grade D post, has\r\n\r\nbeen abolished. Under BAA 1107, three posts of Deputy\r\n\r\nMedical Superintendents. Grade E, positions have also been\r\n\r\nabolished. Similar reductions of senior posts are `also to\r\n\r\nbe found in the Toa Payoh Hospital. This is not conducive\r\n\r\nto our retaining senior doctors who aspire to be promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that in the Physiotherapy Department, with an\r\n\r\nestablishment complement of 32 physiotherapists, we only\r\n\r\nhave 22. This is a shortage of 31%.

Some\r\n\r\nphysiotherapists have worked for 13-14 years without any\r\n\r\npromotions or any prospects for promotions in the near\r\n\r\nfuture. Turnover is very high I am told. In recent years.\r\n\r\nindustrial accident cases have been referred to the\r\n\r\nPhysiotherapy Department more frequently than ever, so that\r\n\r\nthe department is unable to cope with and to give\r\n\r\nsufficient help to the victims. Rehabilitation of\r\n\r\nindustrial accident cases has been neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our specialists and Heads of Medical Units\r\n\r\nresigned without training other officials under them to\r\n\r\ntake over, creating a vacuum. Sometimes one begins to\r\n\r\nwonder if they are deliberately creating a scarcity.\r\n\r\nthereby making themselves indispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be grateful that not all Heads of Units and\r\n\r\nspecialists are in this category. I was therefore very\r\n\r\npleased to note that the President found it fit to bestow\r\n\r\nthe Meritorious Service Medals on Professors Wong Hock Boon\r\n\r\nand Seah Cheng Siang for their devoted service in\r\n\r\nestablishing and training specialists in their School of\r\n\r\nPost-Graduate Medical Studies, Together with these two\r\n\r\nprofessors, we must also be grateful to the team of other\r\n\r\nlecturers and staff who assist them in their training of\r\n\r\nspecialists in this School of Post-Graduate Medical\r\n\r\nStudies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint of doctors who have resigned is about\r\n\r\nthe poor working conditions in our hospitals. In the case\r\n\r\nof the Singapore General Hospital, the complaint is\r\n\r\ngenerally true. I know because I have been there. In some\r\n\r\nwards, no private rooms are available for doctors to do\r\n\r\ntheir work or rest when they are on call or on a long\r\n\r\nstretch of duty. There is a vote in the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates for improvement and redevelopment of the\r\n\r\nSingapore General Hospital. I hope this complaint will be\r\n\r\ntaken care of from this vote\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the reduction of 55\r\n\r\nDivision I posts, as mentioned by the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah, is due to the fact that there is now available\r\n\r\nlocal post-graduate training facilities. These\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare supernumerary posts which were held against doctors who\r\n\r\nonce upon a time were sent abroad for training. But as we\r\n\r\nnow have these facilities, it is considered not necessary\r\n\r\nto have that large number of supernumerary posts. However,\r\n\r\nthat does not mean that we do not want to recruit an\r\n\r\nequivalent number of doctors. I must confess that the\r\n\r\nEstablishment List presented by the Ministry of Finance is\r\n\r\nmore mystifying than clarifying. I myself had to do a\r\n\r\nlittle piece of research to answer the question which has\r\n\r\nbeen raised by the Member for Telok Blangah. May I refer\r\n\r\nhim to this little booklet called the Establishment List of\r\n\r\nSingapore for the Financial Year 1st April, 1976 (031st\r\n\r\nMarch, 1977 (Paper Cmd. 4 of 1976). I was very puzzled\r\n\r\nindeed why there was a reduction of three posts at Grade E\r\n\r\nlevel in the Singapore General Hospital. Let me do a little\r\n\r\nexplanation. I wonder whether the Member for Telok Blangah\r\n\r\nhas got a copy of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Yes.

One ms (107).\" So I had to go and\r\n\r\nfind out what is the meaning of \"prf\" and \"ms\". If he turns\r\n\r\nto page 5, he will find out what is the meaning of \"prf\".\r\n\r\nIt says. \"Post(s) regraded from ...\" and \"ms\" means\r\n\r\n\"Present holder promoted on merit to scale  . That is one.\r\n\r\nIf he looks under \"Surgeon. Grade G, there is a footnote\r\n\r\n(iv) which says. \"Two prf Senior Surgeon.

It is believed\r\n\r\nthat a motor car which was coming from the opposite\r\n\r\ndirection overtook a moving bus and collided head-on into\r\n\r\nthis poor motorcyclist. The motorcyclist was very badly\r\n\r\ninjured in the left leg and lost a right knee cap. After\r\n\r\nthe accident, the driver of the car abandoned his vehicle\r\n\r\nand fled. A number of people gathered to see the injured\r\n\r\nboy who appealed for help, but none gave him a helping\r\n\r\nhand. Fortunately a few off-duty workers who were\r\n\r\ntravelling along that road saw the plight of this poor boy.\r\n\r\nThey took the initiative to take the boy up to the Changi\r\n\r\nHospital. This is where the comedy begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital authorities at Changi did not treat the\r\n\r\ninjured boy simply because the hospital did not have the\r\n\r\nnecessary facilities and expertise to treat his injuries.\r\n\r\nHe was then taken back by the off-duty workers to the scene\r\n\r\nof the accident and left to lie there. In the meantime, an\r\n\r\nambulance had gone to the scene of the accident and left,\r\n\r\nAnother ambulance had to be summoned by some people to come\r\n\r\nand fetch the injured boy to the Singapore General Hospital\r\n\r\nfor immediate attention, Three hours had elapsed before a\r\n\r\nmajor operation was performed. What is important is that\r\n\r\nthe authorities at Changi Hospital should have taken\r\n\r\nimmediate steps to send the boy in their own ambulance to\r\n\r\nthe nearest hospital that has got the facilities to treat\r\n\r\nthe boy, instead of leaving him to the off-duty workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho then decided to take him back to the scene of the\r\n\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder why the Changi Hospital cannot manage with\r\n\r\nsuch emergency cases. I hope the Minister will see that\r\n\r\nample facilities and expertise are made available at this\r\n\r\nhospital as many housing estates are coming up in the\r\n\r\noutskirts of this locality.

I am in no position at all\r\n\r\nto explain away the negligence which the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nhas mentioned just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to inform the House that currently\r\n\r\nthere is correspondence going on between my Ministry and\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Defence as to who is going to take over the\r\n\r\nadministration and responsibility of running the Changi\r\n\r\nmilitary hospital, If it is going to accept civilian\r\n\r\npatients, then of course the Ministry of Health will have\r\n\r\nto have a hand in its administration and running thereof.\r\n\r\nBut I must inform the House that as of this moment,\r\n\r\nnational servicemen are in charge of the Changi military\r\n\r\nhospital. A statement has been issued to say that it is\r\n\r\nprepared to accept civilian patients. I think the statement\r\n\r\ncame out two weeks ago. We should correctly make the\r\n\r\nfullest use of the hospital. But if we were to run the\r\n\r\nmilitary hospital as a civilian hospital, then the cost of\r\n\r\nrunning it is going to be very high indeed, because we have\r\n\r\nto pay the hospital staff civilian rates of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npay whereas national servicemen are being paid\r\n\r\nnational service rates of pay.

Credit must go to them. Our average\r\n\r\nannual birth rate was 1.7% for the period 1971-74 and\r\n\r\nthe present birth rate of less than 1 .4% is an\r\n\r\nachievement better than expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the trade unions have found the officers of the\r\n\r\nBoard most cooperative and helpful in organising\r\n\r\neducational programmes for our workers as well as in\r\n\r\nthe organisation of regional seminars on family\r\n\r\nplanning and population growth.

The new Singapore General\r\n\r\nHospital is going to cost the Government something like\r\n\r\n$200 million in total. With a provision of about 1 .900\r\n\r\nbeds as compared to 1 .400 beds at present, this new\r\n\r\nhospital will therefore require more staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reference to the statements made by previous\r\n\r\nspeakers, I would like in brief, firstly, to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister responsible if he would try to encourage more\r\n\r\npeople to join the staff of the new General Hospital, and\r\n\r\nif he has made any move to ensure that the 200 units of\r\n\r\nhousing promised for medical officers in this House two\r\n\r\nyears ago would be implemented? Secondly, in order to\r\n\r\nencourage more people to take up the medical profession.\r\n\r\nwould he reconsider the slashing of the two weeks\r\n\r\nvacation leave of the house officers? Will the two weeks'\r\n\r\nleave be restored? Thirdly, would he consider overtime\r\n\r\npay for the medical staff? Fourthly, with the\r\n\r\nredevelopment of the Singapore General Hospital on the\r\n\r\nsame campus as the University Faculty of Medicine, would\r\n\r\nhe encourage more Singaporeans to go into the Faculty of\r\n\r\nMedicine, thereby cutting down\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe number of non-citizens who are at present taking up\r\n\r\nplaces which could very well be given to our own citizens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, to answer the last\r\n\r\nquestion first. It will be ideal indeed if more Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens were to opt for medicine or dentistry. If there\r\n\r\nwas a reduction in the number of Singapore students wishing\r\n\r\nto do this discipline. I put the blame fully and squarely\r\n\r\nupon the professional associations themselves, the\r\n\r\nSingapore Medical Association and the Singapore Dental\r\n\r\nAssociation. At some point of time they did put out\r\n\r\nstatements that Singapore was having a surplus of doctors\r\n\r\nand that there were no jobs for dentists. The net result of\r\n\r\nit all was that parents who read that statement in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers believed that there was no future for their\r\n\r\nchildren if they did medicine and dentistry. And.\r\n\r\ntherefore, we landed in a situation where we had to scrape\r\n\r\nthe bottom of the barrel for Singapore students doing\r\n\r\nmedicine and dentistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in the University, I remembered very clearly\r\n\r\nthat we had to lower the number of points to admit\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens into the Medical school. I do not think\r\n\r\nthat was a very good idea because the result is that we are\r\n\r\ngoing to have third-class doctors. If someone is prepared\r\n\r\nto be trained or treated by third-class doctors, that is\r\n\r\nall right with him. But I am not going to be treated by a\r\n\r\nthird-class doctor. I think it will do the Medical school\r\n\r\nevery harm if it was said that our students are less than\r\n\r\nmediocre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, in the field of dentistry, we are taking in\r\n\r\nstudents who opted for dentistry not as their second choice\r\n\r\nbut their third or fourth choice. And so we ended up with\r\n\r\nhaving three or four Singapore citizens opting to do\r\n\r\ndentistry for a few years. It was only last year that we\r\n\r\ngot a good number of Singapore citizens opting to do\r\n\r\ndentistry, even so not all of them chose dentistry as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  first  choice.

I must congratulate\r\n\r\nour officials in leaving a very good impression of\r\n\r\nSingapore at the recent ASEAN Summit Conference at Bali.\r\n\r\nWith this important meeting we seem to have developed\r\n\r\ncloser ties in many respects with our neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noticed in the Estimates that provisions of\r\n\r\n$231,500 and $2,500,000 have been allocated for\r\n\r\ncontributions to the ASEAN Central Secretariat in Jakarta\r\n\r\nand the ASEAN Fund respectively. May I know what role\r\n\r\nSingapore will play in this ASEAN Secretariat? Sir.\r\n\r\nprovision has also been made for ASEAN training awards. I\r\n\r\nwonder how many Singaporeans so far have benefitted from\r\n\r\nthese ASEAN training awards. Under this item, what courses\r\n\r\nare being made available for this year for ASEAN people?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to know what is the basis of posting\r\n\r\nour civil servants to our embassies abroad. How long after\r\n\r\nbeing attached to the Ministry are they posted to our\r\n\r\nembassies? To-date how many of them are still waiting to be\r\n\r\nposted overseas? I raise this question because I gather\r\n\r\nthat a number of our civil servants have resigned from this\r\n\r\nMinistry because of delays in their postings abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Budget Statement I gather that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs is also one of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Ministries that is short of Division I officers. How\r\n\r\ndoes this shortage affect our attempt to open missions or\r\n\r\nembassies in foreign countries. Does this shortage in any\r\n\r\nway affect our overseas missions for purposes of trade? May\r\n\r\nI also ask how successful have we been in all our\r\n\r\ndelegations that have gone overseas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that our trade with Japan, the USA and the\r\n\r\nEuropean countries has declined during the past few years.\r\n\r\nWhat are our embassies in these countries doing to make\r\n\r\nsure that there is an improvement in trade?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago our Foreign Minister led a successful\r\n\r\ndelegation to China. May I know what is the outcome of this\r\n\r\nparticular mission? Have we in any way developed a two-way\r\n\r\ntrade with China? Or has it been one way most of the time?\r\n\r\nWe have created special port facilities for ships from\r\n\r\nChina. Obviously we are importing a lot of Chinese goods\r\n\r\neither for local consumption or for re-export. What has\r\n\r\nbeen China's response towards Singapore-made goods, and\r\n\r\nhave we been successful in selling our products to them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I would like to answer the\r\n\r\nquestions raised by the Members for Serangoon Gardens and\r\n\r\nBras Basah at one go. I am also very glad to find that some\r\n\r\nof our hon. Members are also concerned with the external\r\n\r\nsituation, especially after the ASEAN Summit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation regarding the super-powers or the great\r\n\r\npowers in this region has reached a new kind of power\r\n\r\nrelations. After the Vietnam war all Members are aware that\r\n\r\nAmerican troops have been withdrawn from Vietnam and there\r\n\r\nis also a scaling down of American presence in Thailand. In\r\n\r\nfact, with the present mood of the US Congress, the\r\n\r\nAmericans are not in favour of putting a high stake in\r\n\r\nSouth-east Asia. They do not want to be the policeman in\r\n\r\nSouth-east Asia any more. If the United States show any\r\n\r\nmore interest in this region, it will be purely in\r\n\r\naccordance with their global strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure all Members are aware of the Sino-Soviet feud\r\n\r\nin this region. We, being a very small nation and as a\r\n\r\nmember of ASEAN, must, as the non-communist bloc in this\r\n\r\nregion, try to solve our own problems. Of course, we\r\n\r\nwelcome the great powers in the region. We welcome them if\r\n\r\nthey are able to contribute towards our economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment and in investments and other constructive\r\n\r\nfields. If this helps us to raise our standard of living it\r\n\r\nis to our mutual benefit. But we must also be careful not\r\n\r\nto become pawns in this great power struggle of\r\n\r\ninternational politics. We should not be involved in their\r\n\r\nstruggle. I think that is what the hon. Members for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah and Serangoon Gardens have in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want to become a battle field or proxies of the\r\n\r\ngreat powers in the region. If they want to have any\r\n\r\nconflict, please leave us alone, although we welcome their\r\n\r\npresence here for constructive purposes. I think it is also\r\n\r\nin the interest of the great powers to avert the danger of\r\n\r\nturning small wars into major conflicts. We have seen this\r\n\r\nin other parts of the world when the great powers\r\n\r\ninevitably got involved in bigger struggles. Therefore, it\r\n\r\nis in their interest not to do the same in South-east Asia.\r\n\r\nIf they sincerely want world peace, then it is to their own\r\n\r\nbenefit not to get the small countries in this region\r\n\r\ninvolved in their own conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree wholeheartedly with the Member for Bras Basah\r\n\r\nthat we should be friends to all and enemy to none. The\r\n\r\ncornerstone of our foreign policy is to make as many\r\n\r\nfriends as possible. But sometimes I do not think it is\r\n\r\npossible to avoid making enemies. If we extend the hand of\r\n\r\nfriendship, we expect a reciprocal response to the hand of\r\n\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think not one of the ASEAN leaders has ever criticised\r\n\r\nany of the Communist states in Indo-China either before.\r\n\r\nduring or after the Bali Summit. In fact, if anything was\r\n\r\nmentioned, it was always a gesture of friendship to the\r\n\r\nnewly emerged states in Indo-China, particularly in\r\n\r\nsympathy with the long years of suffering they had had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, after the Bali Summit, a Hanoi newspaper\r\n\r\nopenly encouraged Communist elements in ASEAN countries to\r\n\r\noverthrow the legitimate governments of ASEAN. This. I must\r\n\r\nsay, is quite disappointing because we have extended the\r\n\r\nhand of friendship. We hope the newspaper statement does\r\n\r\nnot really represent the real feelings of all the people in\r\n\r\nlndo-China. If that is the attitude, then it is against the\r\n\r\nspirit of Bandung or even in the spirit of the nonaligned\r\n\r\ngroup, the basic fundamental principle of which is non-interference in the internal affairs of other states. We\r\n\r\nhope that all countries in South-east Asia, whether\r\n\r\ncommunist or non-communist, will abide by this principle,\r\n\r\ncall it what you will, the Bandung spirit or the spirit of\r\n\r\nthe non-aligned group. It is only in that spirit can we\r\n\r\nhave peace and prosperity in the region and all the peoples\r\n\r\nin the region will benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this might have been just a misunderstanding\r\n\r\nof the real nature of ASEAN, because we have been separated\r\n\r\nfor so long. We have been under different colonial regimes\r\n\r\nand they have just gone through a long revolution. It takes\r\n\r\ntime and we hope that with the passage of time this\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding will be cleared. Once this is so, then the\r\n\r\nextent of cooperation between ASEAN and the Communist\r\n\r\nstates in Indo-China will be unlimited. We hope that\r\n\r\ntogether we can cooperate constructively in the economic\r\n\r\nand social fields so that the people in South-east Asia\r\n\r\nwill not become pawns in the super-power or great power\r\n\r\nstruggle and we can help each other to raise the standard\r\n\r\nof living of all the peoples of South-east Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, our immediate task, as far as ASEAN is\r\n\r\nconcerned, is to consolidate the unity and spirit of\r\n\r\ncooperation of the five ASEAN states. That is exactly what\r\n\r\nwe are doing. The Bali Summit was followed by the Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur meeting of finance and economic planners, and I am\r\n\r\nsure Members have read in the newspapers of the latest\r\n\r\ndevelopments. These are solid projects which are being\r\n\r\ntaken seriously by each individual ASEAN state, and we are\r\n\r\nin the process of implementing such projects. We hope that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe success of these small projects will bring about the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of bigger projects. According to the agreement,\r\n\r\nwe hope to have some form of trade preferential arrangement\r\n\r\nfor the products of these projects in ASEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In as far as the Member for Anson's question about\r\n\r\nSingapore's role is concerned, we are a financial centre\r\n\r\nwith better facilities for technology, and we hope that\r\n\r\nwith the cooperation of all our ASEAN partners we can\r\n\r\ntogether develop the natural resources of this region for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of all the people of ASEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point which I like to stress here is that, in order to\r\n\r\nsucceed in the collective effort of economic cooperation.\r\n\r\nall sections of the community in the ASEAN states must bear\r\n\r\nin mind the spirit of give-and-take and to do away with the\r\n\r\nold habit of trying to make a quick buck. There may be some\r\n\r\nwho try to cash in on such projects and we hope that\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, particularly in Singapore, do not give the\r\n\r\nimpression that some of them are exploiting the situation.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we hope that in the other states some of the old\r\n\r\nhabits will also disappear so that there will be real\r\n\r\ncooperation in a common effort to bring about a successful\r\n\r\nconclusion of the projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the ASEAN Secretariat, it was agreed last\r\n\r\nyear that the Secretariat should be based in Jakarta. At\r\n\r\nthe last meeting in Bali they have agreed to appoint Lieut.-Gen. Hartono Dharsono, an experienced Senior Indonesian\r\n\r\ndiplomat, to be the first Secretary-General whose term of\r\n\r\noffice will be two years. Subsequently Secretary-Generals\r\n\r\nwill also have a term of two years. Appointment will be\r\n\r\nrotated among the ASEAN countries in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\nThe senior staff of the Secretariat shall initially\r\n\r\ncomprise three Bureau Directors, one Foreign Trade and\r\n\r\nEconomic Relations Officer, an Administrative Officer, a\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer and an assistant to the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General. The Bureau Directors shall be at least\r\n\r\nof consular rank and each of the other officers shall be at\r\n\r\nleast of First Secretary rank. The principal consideration\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall such nominations and appointments shall be the\r\n\r\nattainment of the highest standards of professional\r\n\r\nefficiency, integrity and the equitable distribution and\r\n\r\nrotation of the post among the nationals of the ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries. Singapore will nominate two officers to fill\r\n\r\nthese posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards ASEAN training awards, they are offered by\r\n\r\nSingapore to other ASEAN member countries. Hence,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are not eligible for these awards. These\r\n\r\ntraining awards comprise on-the-job attachments to the\r\n\r\nvarious Ministries and departments. The philosophy\r\n\r\nunderlying the offer of these training awards is to share\r\n\r\nour experience and skill with other ASEAN member countries\r\n\r\nso as to promote mutual understanding, and to contribute to\r\n\r\nour common endeavour to accelerate economic development in\r\n\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year 1976-77 Singapore is offering 112 training\r\n\r\nawards in 37 courses to ASEAN member countries. The fields\r\n\r\nof training vary from banking and finance to chemical and\r\n\r\nmicrobiological analysis of meat and meat products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On trade missions, last year we had six, either Government-led or -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, on a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.

It\r\n\r\nwas the first time that leaders of the two countries had\r\n\r\ndirect discussions on matters of mutual interest. During\r\n\r\nthe visit we had the opportunity to meet the late Premier,\r\n\r\nMr Chou En-lai, and we held detailed discussions with the\r\n\r\nChinese Foreign Minister, Mr Ch'iao Kuan-hua. The topic of\r\n\r\ndiscussion covered international affairs, matters connected\r\n\r\nwith regional politics as well as bilateral relations\r\n\r\nbetween the two countries. The discussions were free and\r\n\r\nfrank and the participants were able to exchange views on\r\n\r\nbroad international problems. Other members of the\r\n\r\nSingapore mission also had discussions on economic matters\r\n\r\nwith their counterparts. Both sides have agreed to promote\r\n\r\ncloser economic cooperation. As a result of the visit.\r\n\r\nChina and Singapore exchanged trade and industrial missions\r\n\r\nin the latter part of 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also raised the question of overseas\r\n\r\npostings. There is a special course of three months'\r\n\r\ntraining at the University of Singapore. After two years'\r\n\r\ntraining in the various Ministries, including the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Finance, Trade Division, the EDB and in other matters\r\n\r\nwhich a diplomat should know, the officer is then sent\r\n\r\noverseas. I can assure the Member for Anson that there were\r\n\r\nactually two resignations. There was no lack of officers.\r\n\r\nWe have enough officers for our missions for the time\r\n\r\nbeing. It is not easy to choose a suitable officer to be a\r\n\r\ndiplomat overseas because he represents Singapore and we\r\n\r\nmust be careful that he has the knowledge, qualification\r\n\r\nand also integrity, mannerism and personality for the job.\r\n\r\nAll these qualities have to be taken into consideration.

Singapore has\r\n\r\nchosen for good reasons not to establish relations with\r\n\r\nChina just yet. I recognise that we have various channels\r\n\r\nof communication as established in the past and the recent\r\n\r\nvisit of the Minister of State to that nation certainly\r\n\r\nwill lend greater impetus to further relations between\r\n\r\nSingapore and China. What I really would like to know is:\r\n\r\nis Singapore's posture essentially one of waiting for the\r\n\r\nRepublic of Indonesia to establish relations with China?\r\n\r\nAnd will that posture be adopted even if Indonesia were not\r\n\r\nto have relations for the next 1 0 years? I would like to\r\n\r\nknow if there are other considerations which the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister of State might like to share with us that might\r\n\r\nmake Singapore go ahead with recognition, independent of\r\n\r\nIndonesia's move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the ASEAN summit at Bali. I would like to\r\n\r\ntake this opportunity to give my wholehearted support to\r\n\r\nthis concept of regional cooperation, this concept of amity\r\n\r\nand good neighbourliness. I think it is a good thing and a\r\n\r\nmove in the right direction for all five ASEAN states. To\r\n\r\nme, it is an awareness that had been precipitated in\r\n\r\nparticular by the collapse of the three Indo-Chinese\r\n\r\nstates. It is a kind of a shock therapy. It seems to me\r\n\r\nthat it is a common realisation that the best interest of\r\n\r\neach ASEAN nation is best served through the collective\r\n\r\ninterest of the group. I am very happy to note that the\r\n\r\nfive nations have moved forward with great caution, with\r\n\r\ngreat deliberation, and that positive steps have been taken\r\n\r\nto ensure that we are not just coming out with another of\r\n\r\nthese international agreements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am taking this opportunity to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs that whilst ASEAN\r\n\r\ntoday is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nessentially an economic and socio-cultural association of\r\n\r\nnations, will the Minister of State give some kind of\r\n\r\nassurance that ASEAN will not in the foreseeable future\r\n\r\nturn into a military alliance, an alliance that might be\r\n\r\nregarded by certain outside forces as another South-east\r\n\r\nAsian Treaty Organisation? I would be most happy if the\r\n\r\nMinister of State could give this assurance, and further.\r\n\r\nthat Singapore on its part in ASEAN and ASEAN as a whole\r\n\r\nwould collectively make no move that can be construed as\r\n\r\ninimical to forces that are envious of the establishment of\r\n\r\nASEAN. Thirdly, can the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and\r\n\r\nperhaps jointly with the Ministry of Defence assure us\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that none of our troops and national\r\n\r\nservicemen will at any time be sent to combat insurgency\r\n\r\nmovements in foreign territories?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the highlights of the ASEAN Treaty of Amity\r\n\r\nand Concord was the statement of declaration that this\r\n\r\nregion of the world be declared a zone of peace and\r\n\r\nneutrality. I have to grope in my mind for a well\r\n\r\npronounced policy that we used to espouse in the past - that we in Singapore believe in the policy of dynamic\r\n\r\nequilibrium in this region, that policy being more\r\n\r\nrealistic because no super power would ever stay away from\r\n\r\nan area that is a vacuum. In other words, if the Americans\r\n\r\nwere to withdraw from South-east Asia, it is very likely\r\n\r\nthat the Russians would move in, and then what? Hanoi?\r\n\r\nChina? Or the Americans back again? In view of this, how is\r\n\r\nthis erstwhile policy of ours reconciled with the\r\n\r\ndeclaration of the Zone of Peace and Neutrality as stated\r\n\r\nin the Treaty of Amity and Concord?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs to state Singapore's\r\n\r\nposition with regard to the Law of the Sea Conference, in\r\n\r\nparticular to the Straits of Malacca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, it is very obvious to me that you\r\n\r\nmeant to join with the other Members and speak under\r\n\r\nsubhead AAA 1003 rather than on this particular amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, it so happens that I was pre-empted, particularly by the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, first, on the\r\n\r\nestablishment of diplomatic relations with the People's\r\n\r\nRepublic of China. I think our Foreign Minister as well as\r\n\r\nthe Government have made our stand very clear, not on one\r\n\r\noccasion but on several occasions. Our stand does not\r\n\r\nchange: we are still waiting. Our stand is that we will be\r\n\r\nthe last ASEAN country to establish diplomatic relations\r\n\r\nwith the People's Republic of China. I think this is also\r\n\r\nunderstood by the Government of the People's Republic of\r\n\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the assurance that there will be no military\r\n\r\npact, I think everybody knows that after the Bali summit,\r\n\r\nthe ASEAN Heads of States were not in favour of having a\r\n\r\nmilitary pact. Our main emphasis was on economic and\r\n\r\ncultural cooperation. Any kind of military pact would only\r\n\r\naggravate the tension which already exists, even without\r\n\r\nthe mention of the word \"pact\". So there is no point in\r\n\r\naggravating the tension which we are, in fact, trying to\r\n\r\nlessen among nations in South-east Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the guarantee that we will not send troops and our\r\n\r\nservicemen out of Singapore. I think the answer should be\r\n\r\ndirected at the Minister of Defence. However, in the\r\n\r\nabsence of a pact, is there any necessity to send our\r\n\r\ntroops when there is no pact or such understanding? As far\r\n\r\nas I know, at least there is no bilateral arrangement with\r\n\r\nany country. In fact, in certain circumstances the sending\r\n\r\nof troops from one country to another may be interpreted as\r\n\r\nan interference in the internal affairs of that country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng also mentioned the Treaty of\r\n\r\nAmity and Zone of Peace. In actual fact, the Treaty tries\r\n\r\nto ensure that everything will be all right among the five\r\n\r\nmember states of ASEAN. There will be noninterference in\r\n\r\ninternal affairs and, I think, for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat matter unless and until a nation requests another\r\n\r\nnation to send in troops, the act of sending troops from\r\n\r\none country to another will be interpreted as contravening\r\n\r\nthis Treaty of Amity. And as far as I am aware, there is no\r\n\r\nsuch arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Straits of Malacca, our view is that the\r\n\r\nStraits should be made international waters, open to free\r\n\r\nnavigation. Our delegates will soon be attending the\r\n\r\nConference and our main interest is to see that our rights\r\n\r\nare maintained. We have not gone against the Indonesian\r\n\r\nconcept of \"Archipelago\" just for the sake of going against\r\n\r\nthe concept. I think our representative will make it clear\r\n\r\nthat our main interest is to preserve our rights in so far\r\n\r\nas the Law of the Sea is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I am fully satisfied with the\r\n\r\nreply given by the Hon.

Although we have been independent for\r\n\r\nslightly more than 10 years, we are physically represented\r\n\r\nby Ambassadors and High Commissioners in most of the major\r\n\r\ncapitals of the world. However, having overcome the\r\n\r\npreoccupation of making our physical presence felt, I feel\r\n\r\nwe should now aim to give broader meaning to and redefine\r\n\r\nthe role of our overseas missions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we expect them to do? How best can we make use of\r\n\r\ntheir presence abroad so as to benefit the country in more\r\n\r\ntangible terms? These are, to my mind, some of the rather\r\n\r\nrelevant questions. In saying so, I am not thinking so much\r\n\r\nof the traditional role of just maintaining good relations\r\n\r\nwith the host countries, which we are already doing quite\r\n\r\nwell. I am thinking more in terms of what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese missions abroad can do to serve the needs of our\r\n\r\ncommerce and industry at home. At a time when we are\r\n\r\nplacing so much emphasis on export drive, both in respect\r\n\r\nof goods and services. I feel that our overseas missions\r\n\r\ncan make a positive contribution towards our efforts in\r\n\r\nthis direction, provided they are suitably orientated. Up\r\n\r\nto this point of time, I have my doubts as to whether this\r\n\r\nis the case, notwithstanding some of the pre-emptive\r\n\r\nstatements made by the Minister of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we do have commercial secretaries in some of our\r\n\r\nembassies abroad, I rather suspect that their presence is\r\n\r\nno more than an ornament. I also suspect that most of them\r\n\r\nare probably not suitably qualified or trained as to be\r\n\r\nable to function meaningfully in serving the needs of a\r\n\r\ntrading nation, which is what we are and have always been.\r\n\r\nIn any event, considering the relatively junior position of\r\n\r\nsuch commercial secretaries, how much importance do we\r\n\r\nattach to their work at present?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limited usefulness or importance of such appointees\r\n\r\ncan be gauged by the fact that a number of our Government\r\n\r\nagencies involved in economic affairs also have their own\r\n\r\nmen abroad. Take London, for instance. Although I believe\r\n\r\nthat we have a commercial secretary at the High\r\n\r\nCommissioner's Office, EDB and MAS have thought fit to have\r\n\r\ntheir own men on the spot, not to mention the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of other Government-owned enterprises. All\r\n\r\nthis seems to me to be an unnecessary waste of money and\r\n\r\nmanpower. Surely if the post of a commercial secretary is\r\n\r\nupgraded as to carry sufficient seniority and weight, the\r\n\r\nperson, given the right calibre and training, could quite\r\n\r\neasily take care of the affairs of both the EDB and MAS. If\r\n\r\nneed be, he could have a highpowered team working under his\r\n\r\ndirection, rather than to have several sets of people doing\r\n\r\nroughly the same thing at present and, quite rightly, all\r\n\r\nproviding conflicting feed-back to their own respective\r\n\r\ndepartments or superiors at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce we are assured of a more efficient and centralised\r\n\r\nsystem in the collection of commercial and industrial\r\n\r\nintelligence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabroad, the information can be fed back home for use by\r\n\r\nboth Government and the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our businessmen travel abroad on business, they can\r\n\r\nalso rely upon our embassies for guidance and assistance\r\n\r\nwhich could be invaluable. At present I do not think our\r\n\r\nbusiness community knows what sort of services or\r\n\r\nassistance our overseas missions are able to offer them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been exhorting the private sector to\r\n\r\ninnovate and to improve, but are we satisfied that the\r\n\r\nGovernment is also doing the same? Are we making the best\r\n\r\nuse of available resources and facilities at our disposal?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Sir, the suggestions made by the\r\n\r\nMember for Jalan - Kayu are worth considering and I will do\r\n\r\nmy best to convey them to the Ministry of Finance which is\r\n\r\nactually responsible for appointing the various commercial\r\n\r\nattaches, secretaries and also EDB men to the various\r\n\r\noverseas missions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to inform the Member that apart\r\n\r\nfrom the Ambassador, Counsellors and Secretaries, we also\r\n\r\nhave some quite efficient commercial secretaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not say that all of them are of no use. Some of them\r\n\r\nare performing the task. An instance of what they have been\r\n\r\ndoing is the promotion of Singapore's trade interest .in\r\n\r\nthe host country, activities which will promote our\r\n\r\nobjective of increasing the export of Singapore\r\n\r\nmanufactured products. They have to issue leaflets\r\n\r\ninforming all the enterprises as to the products available\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore. They also collate and disseminate all\r\n\r\ninformation relating to trading conditions and regulations\r\n\r\nand other market factors which affect Singapore's export.\r\n\r\nThey also guide visiting businessmen from Singapore and\r\n\r\nintroducing them to relevant contacts in their respective\r\n\r\ncountries, and continuously bearing in mind that commerce\r\n\r\nand economics and politics are merely two aspects of one\r\n\r\nwhole. They therefore maintain closer liaison with other\r\n\r\nofficers in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe mission performing political and other functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1976 the commercial and economic functions of\r\n\r\nour overseas missions were performed by officers who were\r\n\r\nalso responsible for political and other duties. However,\r\n\r\nearly this year since the commercial secretary's service\r\n\r\nwas established some of our overseas missions have been\r\n\r\nstaffed by this special category of officers whose duty is\r\n\r\nconfined to commercial and economic work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small nation. Having served in many missions\r\n\r\nabroad. I can say from my own experience that we are really\r\n\r\nshorthanded. For instance, when I was posted to Cairo I had\r\n\r\nonly one First Secretary who was supposed to help me in\r\n\r\npolitical affairs, one Administrative Officer doing\r\n\r\nadministration, and one Personal Assistant. I was supposed\r\n\r\nto cover five countries, in which I had no office\r\n\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although trading and economic interest is important we\r\n\r\nhave to bear in mind that we cannot afford to spend too\r\n\r\nmuch in sending out officers to a country unless that\r\n\r\ncountry is vital to us economically; which we are doing. It\r\n\r\nis no use sending a commercial attache to a place where we\r\n\r\nhave no business relations or trading arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case the suggestion made by the Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu for a central pooling of all the resources is one\r\n\r\nwhich I Think can be given some consideration, and I assure\r\n\r\nthe Member that this suggestion will be conveyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, before I\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment. I feel that I ought to make one or\r\n\r\ntwo clarifications. I am appreciative of the very\r\n\r\nresponsive manner I have received, but I do not think that\r\n\r\nat any time did I suggest that the present commercial\r\n\r\nsecretaries are of no use. I am not suggesting that. All\r\n\r\nthat I am suggesting is that greater importance should be\r\n\r\nattached to such appointments, and I think we ought to\r\n\r\nupgrade their position so as to carry sufficient weight.\r\n\r\nGiven the right type of officer and the right measure of\r\n\r\ntraining, they could perform more effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly I did not suggest that we should send\r\n\r\ncommercial secretaries round the world. I did not say that.\r\n\r\nWhat I was saying is that we should make the best use of\r\n\r\nthe existing facilities. At present I think there is\r\n\r\nunnecessary duplication. As I have mentioned, DBS got their\r\n\r\nown men. MAS got their own men, and the missions have them\r\n\r\nown men. So do SIA and NOL. In London town I think we\r\n\r\nprobably have 10 to 20 people from the different Government\r\n\r\nagencies. Obviously this is a sheer waste of money. So when\r\n\r\nthe Minister of State talked so much about not getting\r\n\r\nenough money, he has my sympathy. At the same time,\r\n\r\nsomewhere along the line the thinking is quite wrong. On\r\n\r\nthe one hand we try to stinge but on the other hand we let\r\n\r\nall this money go down the drain. I feel that this is a\r\n\r\nvery serious matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the limitations that his Ministry is\r\n\r\nworking up against, the Minister of State has done a very\r\n\r\ngood job. To the Minister of State, in particular. I would\r\n\r\nlike to place on record that what he has done on the\r\n\r\nquestion of our relationship with Indonesia is. I think,\r\n\r\ngenerally known. He has done a first-class job there.\r\n\r\nBusinessmen who have travelled to Indonesia have all said\r\n\r\nthat Mr Lee has given tremendous help. In every case they\r\n\r\nhave expressed them appreciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are talking of Ministries on the Government, not\r\n\r\nof individuals. We are talking of the organisation. How we\r\n\r\ncan improve the organisation, and how to institutionalise\r\n\r\nthe arrangement so that there is continuity? We just cannot\r\n\r\ndepend on a few bright officers, those that the Minister of\r\n\r\nState just quoted, who can use a bit of initiative to go\r\n\r\nout and give pamphlets and in that way promote the image of\r\n\r\nSingapore. That is not what I am thinking. What I am\r\n\r\nthinking is a rather more fundamental issue of\r\n\r\ninstitutionalising our system. I think we have got to that\r\n\r\nstage, and we must think seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee, would you like to reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I would like to thank the Member for\r\n\r\nJalan Kayu for his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompliments.

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P.

While some sectors of the\r\n\r\neconomy are more directly affected by recessionary trends,\r\n\r\nsuch as the manufacturing sector, not all retrenchments\r\n\r\ncarried out are justified. There is always the possibility\r\n\r\nof a few black sheep employers taking advantage of the\r\n\r\npresent economic situation to indulge in anti-labour\r\n\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current legislation under the Industrial Relations Act\r\n\r\nprovides limited scope for unions to check such unfair\r\n\r\npractices by management. The provisions are restrictive as\r\n\r\nthe rule of \"last in, first Out\" no longer applies. Trade\r\n\r\nunions are further hampered in negotiations by the\r\n\r\nstatutory limits on retrenchment benefits to those with\r\n\r\nless than three years' service. It is perhaps ironical that\r\n\r\nthe three-year period intended to protect infant industries\r\n\r\nin Singapore should have - such a wide application of the\r\n\r\nlaw that trading firms and companies with long established\r\n\r\nbusiness in Singapore and with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nless compelling reasons to retrench can now do so as an\r\n\r\neconomic expedient without having to pay any retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits to employees with less than three years' service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the limited safeguards under the Act, abuses are\r\n\r\nbound to occur. Employers must be made to realise that the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Industrial Relations Act are not a carte\r\n\r\nblanche for management to retrench at will non can they\r\n\r\nflout the provisions under the coven of management\r\n\r\nprerogatives. While the Act has been promulgated to\r\n\r\npreserve industrial harmony so essential to the development\r\n\r\nof our economy it would certainly not augur well for the\r\n\r\neconomy if workers' rights for job security and union\r\n\r\nrepresentation are jeopardised by employers who act without\r\n\r\nany moral conscience or sense of social responsibility\r\n\r\ntowards the employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in one particular case, an\r\n\r\nestablished trading company retrenched its entire sales\r\n\r\nforce of 12 counter salesgirls under the guise of adverse\r\n\r\ntrading conditions. Within three months the same company\r\n\r\nrecruited another team of salesgirls at lower salaries for\r\n\r\nits sales counters. Following representation made by the\r\n\r\nunion to the Minister for Labour, the Ministry conducted an\r\n\r\ninvestigation. It was found that this company had indeed\r\n\r\nabused the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act. The\r\n\r\ncompany was accordingly warned by the Ministry. There are\r\n\r\ninstances where it is difficult for the unions to obtain\r\n\r\nsufficient evidence to prove their case. Quite a few\r\n\r\nestablished trading houses have resorted to retrenchment of\r\n\r\nhigher paid employees with long service. Workers within the\r\n\r\nage group of 40-45, with children still in secondary\r\n\r\nschools, face the difficult task of getting alternative\r\n\r\nemployment at the same last drawn salary, in order to\r\n\r\nsupport their families. As theme are no adequate safeguards\r\n\r\nagainst the retrenchment of workers, I would like to put\r\n\r\nforward the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfollowing proposals to the Minister for his consideration,\r\n\r\nwith a view to amending the relevant provisions of the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Provision for unions to seek the intervention of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour and to hold inquiries in cases which are\r\n\r\nunwarranted and are suggestive of manipulation by\r\n\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The present limitation of retrenchment benefits for\r\n\r\nemployees with less than three years' service should not\r\n\r\napply to established trading companies with more than 10\r\n\r\nyears' trading in Singapore, taking into account take-overs, mergers and change of business names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Provision for lay-off and reemployment of retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers, and lastly,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provision for appeal to the Minister under the same\r\n\r\nprocedure as section 35 (2) of the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nAct, if the foregoing proposals are found unacceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Sir, I think I can summarise what the\r\n\r\nMember for Toa Payoh has said. His first point is his\r\n\r\nconcern about certain unfair practices in retrenchment\r\n\r\nexercises over the last couple of years. His second point\r\n\r\nis that he is unhappy about the restrictive provisions in\r\n\r\nthe existing legislation relating to retrenchment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his first point, we fully share his concern. The\r\n\r\nmanagements of firms which intend to retrench workers have\r\n\r\nbeen advised by the Ministry of Labour, and guidelines have\r\n\r\nbeen given by the Ministry for such an exercise. They have\r\n\r\nbeen told that efficiency, competence, industry, correct\r\n\r\nwork attitudes, specialised training in key positions are\r\n\r\nthe criteria as to who should be retained or retrenched.\r\n\r\nThey have also been advised to inform the unions of the\r\n\r\nreasons for the retention of comparatively junior employees\r\n\r\nover senior employees as a result of the implementation of\r\n\r\nthese criteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has been monitoring closely the retrenchment\r\n\r\nsituation. We are satisfied that generally there have not\r\n\r\nbeen abuses by managements. But unions of workers with\r\n\r\ngenuine grievances of unjust retrenchments could refer the\r\n\r\nmatter to the Ministry, and I assure him that thorough\r\n\r\ninvestigations will be conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his second point, in view of the general effectiveness\r\n\r\nof the present system of safeguards against abuses of\r\n\r\nretrenchment, the Ministry does not think that there is a\r\n\r\nneed at this juncture to introduce legislation on the\r\n\r\nmatter. However, let me hasten to add that we are not\r\n\r\nunsympathetic to the genuine plight of retrenched workers.\r\n\r\nespecially those who have family responsibilities. We will\r\n\r\ncertainly introduce amendments if the situation warrants\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are no\r\n\r\nadequate safeguards at all in the Employment Act regarding\r\n\r\nretrenchment, besides the limitation of three years'\r\n\r\nservice. I must say that most employers do not follow the\r\n\r\nguidelines set by the Ministry. The Minister of State\r\n\r\nshould know that in a recent retrenchment exercise by some\r\n\r\ncommercial firms, even salesmen with 20 years of service on\r\n\r\nmore have been retrenched while junior salesmen have been\r\n\r\nretained in the service. Of course, as I have mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier in my speech, it is very difficult to prove it.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason why I am asking for consideration\r\n\r\nwhether certain measures can be taken. Unless the Ministry\r\n\r\ncan give us an assurance that effective steps, like\r\n\r\nimposing certain penalties on the management, are taken.\r\n\r\nthere is no point in sending a letter warning them that\r\n\r\nthey should not indulge in these unfair practices. But then\r\n\r\nnothing further can be done. As I have mentioned in one\r\n\r\nparticular instance involving a trading organisation, the\r\n\r\nMinistry did send a letter of warning, but that is the end\r\n\r\nof the story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, by and large,\r\n\r\nmanagements do cooperate.

The complaints I have received from these\r\n\r\npeople are that it is difficult for them to apply for a\r\n\r\nwork permit. According to a storekeeper, he found it\r\n\r\ndifficult to engage local hands and therefore he has\r\n\r\napplied for a work permit many times but all his\r\n\r\napplications were turned down. So, it vexed him very much.\r\n\r\nThere was also the complaint of a restaurant owner. He has\r\n\r\na son born in Malaysia, and he has passed Secondary IV\r\n\r\nexamination. The father applied for a work permit for his\r\n\r\nson to work as a captain in his restaurant. But this was\r\n\r\nturned down. The reason given was that his son had no such\r\n\r\nexperience. I find this reason unjustified because it is\r\n\r\nnot difficult for a Secondary IV boy to become a captain in\r\n\r\na restaurant. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork is not difficult. With a certain amount of training,\r\n\r\none can be very efficient in this sort of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rejecting the application for work permits for shop\r\n\r\nassistants, the reason given by the Ministry of Labour was\r\n\r\nthat the salary was too low for this kind of job. But such\r\n\r\na reason is no longer applicable now because in his Budget\r\n\r\nStatement the Minister for Finance has pointed out that\r\n\r\nthere should be restriction in wage increases otherwise our\r\n\r\nwage rates would be the highest in Southeast. Asia after\r\n\r\nJapan. Therefore, we should review and liberalise the\r\n\r\nconsideration for applications for work permits by such\r\n\r\npeople. It is a fact that shopowners cannot get local\r\n\r\nhands. It is not that they do not want to employ local\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is about the difficulty encountered by\r\n\r\ngarment factories and food packaging factories in applying\r\n\r\nfor work permits for the number of workers they require.\r\n\r\nThey have to wait from three weeks to one month before\r\n\r\nreceiving a reply as to whether their applications have\r\n\r\nbeen approved. How are these factories, going to proceed\r\n\r\nduring this long wait? I would like to suggest to the\r\n\r\nMinister that during the period when their applications are\r\n\r\nbeing processed whether it is possible for them to engage\r\n\r\nthese factory hands so that they could continue with their\r\n\r\nproductive work. Once their applications have been decided,\r\n\r\nthey can then carry on with their work or they can be told\r\n\r\nto leave, depending on the outcome of their applications.\r\n\r\nWith this sort of arrangement, it will help the\r\n\r\nproductivity of the factories concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon is not here.

Sir, I think the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang had raised the question of shop assistants and\r\n\r\nbarbers during last year's Budget sittings. Members may\r\n\r\nrecall that my reply then was that, with Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontinued policy of rapid industrialisation, it was of\r\n\r\nvital importance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the manpower requirements of the industries should\r\n\r\nfirst be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with this policy, the Ministry has continued to\r\n\r\naccord priority to applications for work permits from non-citizens seeking employment in factories and other\r\n\r\nindustrial undertakings. As long as our economic objectives\r\n\r\nand manpower strategy remain unchanged, non-citizens\r\n\r\nwishing to pursue soft or relatively unproductive jobs,\r\n\r\nlike shop assistants or other white collar jobs like\r\n\r\nsalesman, etc., cannot be given priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospect immediately ahead for our economy is not\r\n\r\nexpected to be one of high growth rate. In 1975, there was\r\n\r\nonly a real growth rate of 4.1%. At the same time, it has\r\n\r\nbeen estimated that the number of students leaving schools\r\n\r\neach year, without completing their secondary education.\r\n\r\nwould remain around 22.000. Many of these premature school\r\n\r\nleavens would not be in a position to find meaningful\r\n\r\nemployment on account of their age, low educational\r\n\r\nqualifications and lack of any marketable skills. Although\r\n\r\nthe Government is looking into various schemes to encourage\r\n\r\nthese youths to take up careers in industries, not all of\r\n\r\nthem will or can be successfully absorbed. Other job\r\n\r\nopportunities such as shop assistants or restaurant workers\r\n\r\nand so forth must be found for them. Under these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, it is unlikely that the Ministry would\r\n\r\nconsider relaxing its work permit policy in regard to non-citizens employed in such occupations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of barbers, the Ministry has not been unduly\r\n\r\nrestrictive in granting work permits to non-citizens\r\n\r\nengaged in this occupation. The Ministry is aware that few\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are interested in taking up such employment.\r\n\r\nHowever, non-citizens wishing to secure employment as\r\n\r\nbarbers must at least possess the requisite skill for the\r\n\r\njob. As such, work permits are only granted to those who\r\n\r\nhave passed a practical test conducted by the Adult\r\n\r\nEducation Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of female barbers, they must, in addition to\r\n\r\npassing the trade test, have at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleast completed six years of primary education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang may wish to note that about 28%\r\n\r\nof the barbers working in Singapore are work permit\r\n\r\nholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister has\r\n\r\nnot answered the other point relating to the application\r\n\r\nfor a work permit by garment and food factory workers who\r\n\r\nhave to wait for three weeks to one month for a decision.

If the\r\n\r\nfactories concerned are producing goods and services which\r\n\r\nare given priority by the EDB, temporary permission of one\r\n\r\nmonth is normally given to applicants while their\r\n\r\napplications are being processed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

In fact, I myself am without one\r\n\r\nat the moment. For the information of Members, we have been\r\n\r\nvery liberal in granting work permits to people who wish to\r\n\r\nbecome domestic servants for obvious reasons, because we\r\n\r\nwant to encourage women, especially those who are highly\r\n\r\nqualified, to work. I do not agree that we have been rather\r\n\r\nrestrictive in issuing work permits to domestic servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for tailors. I think I have mentioned earlier that we\r\n\r\nare giving priority for the issuance of work permits to\r\n\r\nthose who want to work in industries, particularly those\r\n\r\nindustries that are engaged in production for export.\r\n\r\nTailors, unfortunately, do not come within this category.\r\n\r\nBut if it is a textile factory which is producing goods for\r\n\r\nexports, then they will be given priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members have to bear in mind that the interest of\r\n\r\nour own citizens must come first. In those cases mentioned\r\n\r\nby the Member for Potong Pasir, if those foreigners are\r\n\r\nprepared to work in factories on in industrial\r\n\r\nundertakings. I am sure their applications will be\r\n\r\nfavourably considered. But if they are only interested in\r\n\r\nsoft jobs which do not require much exertion, then I am\r\n\r\nafraid we have to be rather restrictive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, my point has still not been\r\n\r\nanswered. The point I made was that the problem arises on\r\n\r\naccount of the distance away from town. No local citizens\r\n\r\nwant to take up jobs in Jalan Kayu. As I see it, it is not\r\n\r\na good idea to judge on the basis that if a garment factory\r\n\r\nis export-orientated it can have the workers. I think that\r\n\r\nis oven-simplifying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I see it is that we should also think of its\r\n\r\neffect on the cost of living of the people. If we make it\r\n\r\nunduly restrictive, then the cost of tailoring goes up.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that today if we want to make a pair of\r\n\r\ntrousers, it will cost a lot more and the reason is that\r\n\r\nthere is an acute shortage of skilled tailors. I emphasise\r\n\r\nthe word \"skilled\". I think the present approach seems to\r\n\r\nbe rather hard-and-fast without proper consideration given\r\n\r\nto the circumstances. Take tailoring, for instance. There\r\n\r\nare lots of little tailor shops. They do export. They might\r\n\r\nnot export directly but they sub-contract from bigger shops\r\n\r\nin town which provide a 24-hour service to tourists. So in\r\n\r\na way this is an\r\n\r\ninvisible export.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their contribution is just as great. The fact that all\r\n\r\nthese little shops are in the rural areas, their overheads\r\n\r\nare kept low. Because their overheads are low, they are\r\n\r\nable to sell at a competitive price, lower than that in\r\n\r\nHong Kong. I do not think we have looked into this problem\r\n\r\nin sufficient depth. There seems to be the tendency for\r\n\r\ncivil servants to say. \"Well, the rule says this type of\r\n\r\nwork is not on. No. That type of workers is on.\" As I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay, that is not doing our economy and our standard of\r\n\r\nliving any good at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

A factory produces goods and sells them.\r\n\r\nContractors come to the tailor's shop to get 100 suits for\r\n\r\na ship's crew but the tailor cannot make the suits. So why\r\n\r\ndo we not give the tailor work permits? I applied for a\r\n\r\nwork permit for a tailoress, but it was turned down many\r\n\r\ntimes. So the tailor shop had to close down because it\r\n\r\ncould not get enough help to run the shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like the\r\n\r\nMinister to reconsider my case. I agree with him that we\r\n\r\nmust look after our industrialisation scheme. We have\r\n\r\nemphasised that our economy is a diversified one. Apart\r\n\r\nfrom industries we must also look after the other aspect of\r\n\r\nour economy, for example, the petty traders. Local\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens are not interested and they are,\r\n\r\ntherefore, forced to employ non-citizens. If we want to\r\n\r\nemphasise a diversification of our economy, we should look\r\n\r\nafter the other sectors of the economy too and not just\r\n\r\nindustrialisation alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I want to make one point clear. We\r\n\r\nare not refusing to allow skilled tailors from coming in.\r\n\r\nIn fact, many work permits have been issued to skilled\r\n\r\ntailors. It is only the unskilled tailors that we have to\r\n\r\nconsider very carefully. In case of doubt we always send\r\n\r\nthe applicant for a skill evaluation test at the Adult\r\n\r\nEducation Board. And in cases of refusal, the employer can\r\n\r\nappeal on their behalf, and if there are good reasons why\r\n\r\napproval should be granted, it would be granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oven the last few years, with industrialisation, the\r\n\r\nwhole economy has changed. In fact, one has to begin to\r\n\r\nconsider whether the traditional type of business, like the\r\n\r\nprovision shop, is desirable when we are faced with a\r\n\r\nlabour shortage. There has been a mushrooming of\r\n\r\nsupermarkets, shopping complexes, self-service shops and so\r\n\r\nforth, and this is a response to this kind of situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I do not think we can go on as before.

For example, there\r\n\r\nis provision for nine Division I Officers for the year 1976\r\n\r\nas compared to the provision for only two Division I\r\n\r\nOfficers in 1975 and the previous year. Such increase is in\r\n\r\nitself desirable in view of the importance placed by the\r\n\r\nGovernment on the question of industrial relations in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of this House may recall, the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour in his address at the opening ceremony of the SILO-PIEU Triennial Delegates' Conference on 27th February this\r\n\r\nyear at the Singapore Conference Hall has given emphasis to\r\n\r\nthe desirability of promoting harmonious industrial\r\n\r\nrelations in Singapore. Taken in conjunction with the\r\n\r\nobjectives of the 1976 budget, that is, to encourage\r\n\r\nforeign investors and develop new projects in Singapore.\r\n\r\nthe importance of giving priority to industrial relations\r\n\r\nin Singapore cannot be overstressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister stated in his speech. \"There is therefore\r\n\r\na need for more professionally trained managers in industry\r\n\r\nand better trained branch officials and HQ industrial\r\n\r\nrelations officers\". The Minister went on to say.\r\n\r\n\"Industrial Relations Officers and union officials should\r\n\r\nknow among other things more about how the problems of\r\n\r\nworkers and management can best be explained to each side\r\n\r\nand resolved effectively\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well happen that given the best of will and\r\n\r\nability on the part of the personnel management of the\r\n\r\nemployer and the Industrial Relations Officers of the\r\n\r\nunion, they still cannot settle a dispute. Here is where\r\n\r\nthe conciliation machinery created under the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Act can help both parties to work out an\r\n\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that the officers who are to be recruited\r\n\r\nfor or posted to the Industrial Relations Division of the\r\n\r\nMinistry are competent and trained civil servants. My only\r\n\r\nconcern is whether such officers are competent and trained\r\n\r\nin industrial relations matters. I am not aware that the\r\n\r\nMinistry itself has conducted any training courses or\r\n\r\nschemes in industrial relations for its officers, nor am I\r\n\r\naware that any other Ministry or department of the\r\n\r\nGovernment has conducted any training courses or schemes in\r\n\r\nindustrial relations matters for civil servants. I hope I\r\n\r\nam wrong and that the officers who are to man the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Division will be officers with\r\n\r\nsufficient experience and expertise in industrial relations\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also help if the Ministry can ensure that due cane\r\n\r\nis taken in the manning of the Division to prevent too\r\n\r\nfrequent turnover of staff in the Division. As I understand\r\n\r\nit, there had been a change of the Head of the Division\r\n\r\nwithin one year of its establishment. Even if it is\r\n\r\nconceded that the change is unavoidable, the need for such\r\n\r\nchanges should be minimised for the proper and effective\r\n\r\nfunctioning of the Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that respect it would be of interest to Members of\r\n\r\nthis House if the Minister can indicate whether the\r\n\r\nMinistry has been able to resolve a higher proportion of\r\n\r\nthe trade dispute under conciliation since the setting up\r\n\r\nof the Industrial Relations Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am inclined to have my doubts about the effectiveness\r\n\r\nof the Division. For instance,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen I inquired from my trade union colleagues about the\r\n\r\n\"Preventive Mediation Labour Assessment Section\", I could\r\n\r\nnot receive any definite reply as to the function of that\r\n\r\nSection.

If there is a confusion oven\r\n\r\nthe respective functions or a duplication in the work of\r\n\r\nthis Sectior and the Conciliation Section.
