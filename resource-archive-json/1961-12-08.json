There was an oversight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's policy towards expatriates\r\n\r\nintervening in local political affairs was  considered\r\n\r\nand  stated  on the occasion when a Professor  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya inadvertently wandered  into  the\r\n\r\nfield of political controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case referred to by the Member for Anson, I\r\n\r\nhave  received a long letter from the lawyer concerned\r\n\r\nand another from his client. The lawyer explained that\r\n\r\nthe offending statement attributed to him in the Press\r\n\r\nwas, in fact, a Press news item and not a statement by\r\n\r\nhim. The point that non-citizens should not enter  the\r\n\r\npolitical    arena   which   includes   trade    union\r\n\r\ndisputes - particularly  where the  Communist-controlled\r\n\r\nunions  are  involved  - has  already  been  made   and\r\n\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, we have stated that Government does not\r\n\r\napprove   of   non-citizens  interfering  with   local\r\n\r\npolitical affairs. The Government would strongly  urge\r\n\r\nnon-citizens  who are British European expatriates  to\r\n\r\nstay out of the local political arena and let none of\r\n\r\ntheir  acts,  either intentionally  or  otherwise,  be\r\n\r\nconstrued  as intervening in local political  matters.\r\n\r\nThis  principle  applies to a  man  whether  he  is  a\r\n\r\nProfessor   at  the  University, a  lawyer   in   the\r\n\r\nprofession or  merchant in commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  whether he is conscious that a  man  in  the\r\n\r\nexercise  of  his  professional duties  has  often  to\r\n\r\naccept  instructions and to pursue a  line  of  action\r\n\r\nwhich  may  be  deemed to have political implications.\r\n\r\nDoes  he then consider that because the person  is  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate he should be precluded from exercising  his\r\n\r\nprofession  in  any  fields  where  there   might   be\r\n\r\npolitical implications?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the dividing line between\r\n\r\nbeing  just  the  agent for an employer  and  being  a\r\n\r\nparticipant is quite a clear one. A lawyer who  issues\r\n\r\na statement in the name of his client is only an agent\r\n\r\nand  the  client takes the consequences. I  think  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson is aware - particularly in the case  of\r\n\r\nPress  statements - that no advocate and  solicitor  can\r\n\r\nissue  statements in his personal capacity or  in  his\r\n\r\nfirm's name, because that means, amongst other things,\r\n\r\nbreaching  the  rules  of  etiquette  with  regard  to\r\n\r\nadvertising. Had this statement been attributed not to\r\n\r\nthe  lawyer but to the client, a completely  different\r\n\r\nposition would have arisen. He would have been a  pure\r\n\r\nagent.  But  where,  as in this particular  case,  the\r\n\r\nPress report stated that he as the lawyer had said  so\r\n\r\nafter he left the Ministry of Labour, obviously he did\r\n\r\nit in his capacity as the lawyer and not as the agent,\r\n\r\nthen  the Government drew certain inferences from  it.\r\n\r\nAs  I  have  explained, he has in a very  long  letter\r\n\r\nelaborated  on the circumstances of how the  statement\r\n\r\ncame to be reported and I have no intention of opening\r\n\r\nthe matter unless he wishes to do so publicly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker.

But the statement made by the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ndoes  raise anxiety from this point of view.  He  said\r\n\r\nthat  British expatriates should not intentionally  or\r\n\r\notherwise conduct themselves in a manner which may  be\r\n\r\ndeemed to interfere in our local politics. I would ask\r\n\r\nwhether, in fact, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintends  that  to be a statement of Government  policy\r\n\r\nand  that  if  these expatriates do  inadvertently  so\r\n\r\nconduct  themselves that they are deemed to  interfere\r\n\r\nin  our  local politics they are to believe  that  the\r\n\r\nSword of Damocles will then fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As I have stated in opening my\r\n\r\nstatement, the matter was carefully considered as  one\r\n\r\nof  Government policy in the case of the Professor  of\r\n\r\nthe University of Malaya and the principle was clearly\r\n\r\nenunicated - intended seriously and put across seriously\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- and the line of demarcation between pursuing one's\r\n\r\nprofession   and   one's  academic  freedom   in   the\r\n\r\nUniversity and meddling in local affairs has been made\r\n\r\nand  has been understood. From time to time, those who\r\n\r\ntransgress will have to be reminded of the  policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  If  it  is  a  pure  and  accidental\r\n\r\ntransgression,  surely  the  Government  will  not  be\r\n\r\nunreasonable; but if it is persistently repeated, then\r\n\r\nthe Government must sit up and take note of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Sir, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe   Prime   Minister  whether  he   would   consider\r\n\r\npublishing the letters to which he referred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the letters were sent to me\r\n\r\nin  my  capacity as Prime Minister in the case of  the\r\n\r\nemployer. I am speaking now from recollection. I found\r\n\r\nthem in my tray, having been opened by my Secretary. I\r\n\r\nthink  they were marked 'confidential', but I have  no\r\n\r\nobjection  really  to asking the employer  to  publish\r\n\r\nthem. The one from the lawyer was marked 'personal and\r\n\r\nconfidential'. He is a man whom I have known for  some\r\n\r\ntime  at  the Bar. As I have said, I have no objection\r\n\r\nto  his publishing that letter and my replying  to  it\r\n\r\npublicly.  Sir, it is not for me to receive  a  letter\r\n\r\nmarked 'personal and confidential' and to publish  it.\r\n\r\nBut  if  either the employer or the lawyer  wishes  to\r\n\r\npublish  it and open the subject for a public  debate,\r\n\r\nthen  I  must be prepared to allow them to do  so.  In\r\n\r\nfact, I would not say I welcome it, nor would I say  I\r\n\r\ndo not welcome it. But if they take that step, then  I\r\n\r\nenter  into the open controversy. But I cannot publish\r\n\r\na letter - particularly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na long one - from a lawyer whom I  met,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  quite accidentally at the Ipoh Airport. He  had\r\n\r\ncome  down from Cameron Highlands and in a few minutes\r\n\r\nexplained to me that it was all a misunderstanding and\r\n\r\nthen   set   out   in   a   long   letter   how    the\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding,  in his view, arose.  The  long  and\r\n\r\nshort  of it is that he said that it was a news report\r\n\r\nand  not  a  statement by him. And  there  the  matter\r\n\r\nrests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I wonder whether\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister means what he says. He says  that\r\n\r\nnon-citizens  should  not  interfere  in  trade  union\r\n\r\nmatters  of  Singapore and also in local politics.  He\r\n\r\nknows that there are a number of non-citizens who  are\r\n\r\nvery  active in the trade union field. One non-citizen\r\n\r\nparticularly  named by him was alleged by  him  to  be\r\n\r\nmost   active  during  the  trouble  with  the  school\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the most important principle\r\n\r\nin  politics  is  basic realism. The person  that  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill has referred to but not named,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  is  Mr Fong Swee Suan. We have  withheld  his\r\n\r\ncitizenship papers for reasons which I think are  well\r\n\r\nknown  to  Mr Fong Swee Suan, and I do not intend  to\r\n\r\npublish them unless he insists on it. The case of  Mr\r\n\r\nFong Swee Suan and that of the lawyer concerned are  a\r\n\r\nbit  different.  One is a British European  expatriate\r\n\r\nwho dropped into Singapore in the 1950's and wanted to\r\n\r\nmake  a  living.  He is staying here just  to  make  a\r\n\r\nliving.  The other one is a person who came here  from\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of Malaya, went to the  Chinese  High\r\n\r\nSchool   and  has  since  been  somewhat   active   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. He has been involved in many of the  events\r\n\r\nwhich  had  interested both the Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nwhen  he  was the Chief Minister and I since I  became\r\n\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would say that, on principle, I fully agree\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  inadvisable for any  non-citizen  to  be\r\n\r\ninvolved in political matters. It is not for me to say\r\n\r\nhow  circumstances may develop in which  it  would  be\r\n\r\nvery  unwise  for non-citizens to be so  involved,  be\r\n\r\nthey  expatriates  of  European, Indian  or  Ceylonese\r\n\r\norigin, or even of other origin nearer home, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperhaps obviously they feel that the time has not  yet\r\n\r\ncome  and  it is really left to future events  to  see\r\n\r\nwhen the time will come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have another question, Sir.

By the rationing, we have  been\r\n\r\nable  to reduce from 30 million gallons per day to  20\r\n\r\nmillion  gallons per day, the amount we draw from  the\r\n\r\nreservoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year over the rainy months of November,\r\n\r\nDecember,  and  January, the reservoirs  are  normally\r\n\r\nfilled  up  to total capacity.

As soon as indications are that\r\n\r\nthe  monsoon  is  wet and there is a fair  expectation\r\n\r\nthat  the reservoirs will be filled up by the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe monsoon period of January, water rationing will be\r\n\r\nlifted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, in view of the public concern and talk\r\n\r\nabout this matter, which I am sure is quite unpleasant\r\n\r\nto  the  Government, would the Prime Minister  clarify\r\n\r\nwhether  the  political  pressure  in  Singapore   has\r\n\r\nanything to do with the variation in water pressure?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is completely out of order.

From  time  to\r\n\r\ntime,  the  Head  of  State and the Ministers  receive\r\n\r\ngifts  from  visiting dignitaries and other  Ministers\r\n\r\nfrom  foreign  countries who pass  through  Singapore.\r\n\r\nNormal courtesy requires that there is reciprocity  of\r\n\r\nthese  gifts. In the old days, Sir, what happened  was\r\n\r\nthat  where  they were personal gifts, that  is,  the\r\n\r\ngifts were to the person con, cerned, he kept it. When\r\n\r\nhe  reciprocated,  he  paid for  it  out  of  his  own\r\n\r\nexpenses. He kept the gift that was given to him,  and\r\n\r\nhe  paid  for the gift that was given to the  visiting\r\n\r\ndignitary.  In  fact, the ruling since the  Government\r\n\r\ntook  office  is  that  all  gifts  presented  to  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  or to the Head of State are surrendered  to\r\n\r\nthe  Treasury. If they cannot be used, they are either\r\n\r\ndisposed  of by the Treasury or they are left  in  the\r\n\r\nIstana\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegara, the State Guest House, or the reception  rooms\r\n\r\nof the various Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> On a point of\r\n\r\nclarification, Mr Speaker.

In so far as I am aware, at no time did any  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  retain any gifts  received  officially\r\n\r\nfrom  other  Ministers or Government.  They  were  all\r\n\r\nhanded in to the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think there was a distinction\r\n\r\nbetween  the official and the non-official  Ministers.\r\n\r\nThe  elected Ministers, as in the case of  the  former\r\n\r\nChief  Minister,  the Member for  Cairnhill,  and  his\r\n\r\ncolleagues, paid out of their entertainment vote  when\r\n\r\nthey  bought  gifts in return. They surrendered  their\r\n\r\ngifts  to  the  Treasury. In the  case  of  the  other\r\n\r\nofficials,  I think the practice was that either  they\r\n\r\nbought gifts in return out of their own emoluments and\r\n\r\nthen  kept  the gifts, or they left the gifts  in  the\r\n\r\nIstana.  As far as I know, either the gifts were  kept\r\n\r\nin  the Istana or left in the Treasury. Anyway,  these\r\n\r\nare  not  very important things. What has happened  is\r\n\r\nthat for the last two years, when we reciprocated,  we\r\n\r\npaid   for  it  front  the  entertainment  vote.   The\r\n\r\nAccountant-General queried this and said that this was\r\n\r\nnot  a  proper  vote  for  the reciprocity  of  gifts.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a modest sum has been entered for the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara and for myself.  It  is  more  for\r\n\r\nmyself because out of this vote come the gifts for all\r\n\r\nMinisters.

Indeed, like\r\n\r\nthe gift from the Prime Minister of the Provisional\r\n\r\nGovernment of Algeria, it was a scimitar. We left that\r\n\r\nat Sri Temasek because many people go there and they\r\n\r\nwould like to know whose gift it was. So it is\r\n\r\ndifficult for us to evaluate the gifts. But because\r\n\r\nours is a small State, when we reciprocate, the gifts\r\n\r\nare, if possible, those made in Malaya. They are\r\n\r\nproduced by the Malay Arts and Crafts of Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\nI feel proud that we share the pride of Malaya in the\r\n\r\nachievements of their arts and crafts, especially\r\n\r\nthose produced by the craftsmen in Trengganu and\r\n\r\nKelantan.

(In\r\n\r\nMalay):  As  to this matter, the position, to my  mind,  is\r\n\r\nthis.  As  regards the Supreme Court interpreters  and  the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Court  interpreters, the reason for  there  being\r\n\r\nmore  Indian or Chinese interpreters is not for the purpose\r\n\r\nof increasing their number. This matter concerns people who\r\n\r\nare  witnesses  and whose evidence requires interpretation.\r\n\r\nThere  are  not many Malay witnesses and, therefore,  there\r\n\r\nare not as many Malay interpreters as there are Chinese  or\r\n\r\nIndian interpreters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of Singapore comprises 70 per cent\r\n\r\nChinese;  therefore more Chinese interpreters are required.\r\n\r\nFor  that  reason, the Indian interpreters are in a  better\r\n\r\nposition.  Since  the  Malays are a  peace  loving  people,\r\n\r\ntherefore  the  position  of the Malay  interpreters  is  a\r\n\r\nlittle  unsatisfactory from the point of view. I  think  in\r\n\r\nthe other courts there are not many cases involving Malays.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  quite clear as to why there is no Senior  Malay\r\n\r\nInterpreter.

All this arises out of cases\r\n\r\nassigned to' those on the roster in respect of capital\r\n\r\ncharges. Cases are assigned to these young lawyers  as\r\n\r\ntheir  names appear on this roster, and the fees  paid\r\n\r\nto  them, to my mind anyway, are not commensurate with\r\n\r\nthe work which they have to undertake. They have to do\r\n\r\na  fair  amount of \"getting-up\" in these things.  They\r\n\r\nwork  very hard and the getting-up fee allowed by  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar (it is not his fault, Mr Speaker,  Sir;  it\r\n\r\nhas been a time-honoured custom and I think these fees\r\n\r\nhave remained for some time without change) is, in  my\r\n\r\nopinion  anyway, not commensurate with the work  which\r\n\r\nthe  young  lawyer has to undertake.

At the\r\n\r\nmoment,  Sir,  this  legal aid is  only  available  to\r\n\r\npersons  who  are  charged with  capital  offences.

Even if we succeed in doing\r\n\r\nthat without upsetting the Speaker, the Ministers, the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries, the Permanent  Secretaries,\r\n\r\nand so on, there is a very serious problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that if you want to maintain a strong\r\n\r\njudiciary, the time has come when you have to  recruit\r\n\r\nnot  only from within the service but from without the\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To do that - as the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  well knows - one can only hope that there  are  a\r\n\r\nsufficient number of able and senior counsel who  feel\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  done their sweat  at  the  Bar,  put\r\n\r\nsomething  by, and are prepared to spend the  rest  of\r\n\r\ntheir active years on the Bench. I have discussed this\r\n\r\nmatter   incidentally  also  with   passing   judicial\r\n\r\ndignitaries from the United Kingdom.

I  was  wondering  whether   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   would  increase  the  number  of   Assembly\r\n\r\nservants  to four so that there will be a rotation  in\r\n\r\ntheir  hours  of duty, as I think they are  not  being\r\n\r\ngiven  fair  treatment. For instance. I do  know  that\r\n\r\nthey check in at about 7.30 in the morning and on  any\r\n\r\nnormal sitting day they do not leave the Assembly till\r\n\r\nafter 9.30 in the evening, which means 14 hours'  work\r\n\r\na  day  invariably. We do have night sitting up to  12\r\n\r\no'clock midnight or 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, and\r\n\r\nthat  would  mean up to about 17 or 18 hours'  work  a\r\n\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would suggest to the Prime Minister that it is\r\n\r\nabout  time  that we increased the number of  Assembly\r\n\r\nservants, if not on a permanent basis then at least on\r\n\r\na temporary basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Here again, it is a matter which the\r\n\r\nHouse    Committee   could   deal   with   and    make\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Abdul Hamid: Mr Speaker, Sir, may I point out\r\n\r\nthat  there were a number of recommendations  made  by\r\n\r\nthe House Committee last year but they were thrown out\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister for Finance?

On  the\r\n\r\nlast  occasion when we had a sitting till 12 midnight,\r\n\r\nalthough   I  was  not  approached  by  the   servants\r\n\r\nthemselves, I understand they did not have time to  go\r\n\r\nhome.  We  left  the  House at 12  midnight  and  they\r\n\r\nfinished  their work at about 3 a.m. So what they  did\r\n\r\nwas  to  sleep  in the Assembly House  itself  without\r\n\r\nhaving a bath or a wash and a change of clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this has been going on for a number\r\n\r\nof  years  and I think the only solution  is  to  have\r\n\r\ntemporary staff - one servant perhaps when the  Assembly\r\n\r\nis  not in session; three or four when the Assembly is\r\n\r\nin  session, when Members want them to buy food, serve\r\n\r\nbeer  and run a lot of errands. For all the work  that\r\n\r\nthey have to do, ranging from 10 to 20 hours a day,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  they are only paid $142 a month  inclusive\r\n\r\nof allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe it is time for the Government to take some action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps it is time the House Committee\r\n\r\nshould look very, very deeply into this matter in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance,  and  if the recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  Committee  are not accepted by the  Government,\r\n\r\nthen  that is the time Members could move a motion.

It is not because we do  not\r\n\r\ncare  for them. There is a House Committee to consider\r\n\r\ntheir  case.  But  if  we  start  spinning  yarns  and\r\n\r\nstriking a pose, Sir, everybody can do likewise and we\r\n\r\nwill  soon  reduce the proceedings of this Chamber  to\r\n\r\nquite a comic operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With great respect to the Member for Hong Lim - he is\r\n\r\nan   experienced  man  in  politics  and  we  are  not\r\n\r\naltogether new in these matters - we do not want to  get\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  these hardship stories - the sob  line.

And he\r\n\r\ngot  the  rest of the All-Party Delegation in complete\r\n\r\nagreement   with   him - that  the   opportunities   for\r\n\r\nadvancement in the Legislative Assembly are  so  small\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  very  unlikely that we will  get  people\r\n\r\ncoming  into the service as such. As I have  said  the\r\n\r\nlast time - and I repeat the argument this year as I did\r\n\r\nlast  year  and the year before - if the Assembly  staff\r\n\r\nsay, \"All right. I want to stay in the Assembly and  I\r\n\r\ndon't  want ever to be posted out. I want to be  in  a\r\n\r\nseparate  service,  and I lose  my  opportunities  for\r\n\r\npromotion in the Government.\" - well, let them make  the\r\n\r\nrepresentation.    We   have    not    received    the\r\n\r\nrepresentation yet. For the very simple reason that if\r\n\r\nthey  make  that  representation,  then  avenues   for\r\n\r\npromotion in the Assembly stop and there are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  other  avenues for promotion. If you  have  young,\r\n\r\nreasonably  healthy First Clerk, Second  Clerk,  Third\r\n\r\nClerk, Chief Reporter, Deputy Chief Reporter, and  you\r\n\r\njoin  the Assembly staff as a separate and independent\r\n\r\nservice and you grow old together with the Chief  and,\r\n\r\nworse  still, you pre-decease him, then you might  end\r\n\r\nup  your  careers  as, say, the unknown  Fifth  Clerk;\r\n\r\nnever heard of ever since. Whereas if you are part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government service, you might be more  fortunate.\r\n\r\nIf  avenues are not readily open in the Assembly, then\r\n\r\nyou  transfer out to the medical services or the Legal\r\n\r\nDepartment  or some other Ministry of the  Government.\r\n\r\nThe  problem  is as simple as that. As you  know,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, there are certain specialist  jobs.  In\r\n\r\nthe  case of those officials, they are not posted  out\r\n\r\nunless they give their consent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is to be a radical alteration in the terms\r\n\r\nand  conditions of service, I say it comes from  them.\r\n\r\nIf they want their avenues of promotion blocked, well,\r\n\r\nso  be it. But they cannot have it, as the Speaker has\r\n\r\nsuggested   once,  both  ways - that   they   can   post\r\n\r\nthemselves  out  but whilst they  are  here  they  are\r\n\r\nindependent.  That is not possible.  They  are  either\r\n\r\npart  of the service and they take their chances  like\r\n\r\neverybody  else  in the service to go up  the  ladder,\r\n\r\nwhich  includes  the Assembly, or  they  stay  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. And if they stay in the Assembly, then  they\r\n\r\nforgo  the  opportunities for  advancement  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot have it both ways. We have argued it  out\r\n\r\nwith  logic  and reason in Establishment practice.  If\r\n\r\nthey  are  an  independent  service,  then  they  have\r\n\r\nnothing to do with the Government. And if there is  an\r\n\r\nopening for promotion in the Government, well,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  open to them any more. It has been suggested that\r\n\r\nwhilst  they are in the Assembly, they are out of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But  the moment they  hear  there  is  an\r\n\r\nopening,  they say, \"I come back,\" and  then  \"I  move\r\n\r\noff.\"  That  is not possible. The Establishment  would\r\n\r\nnot have it. And I think the Finance Minister is quite\r\n\r\nright in backing up his Establishment on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The problem is a sufficiently important\r\n\r\none,  Mr Speaker, Sir. The difficulty arises  because\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  here is such a small Assembly  and  the\r\n\r\nstaff  are  so  small.  But in most  other  countries,\r\n\r\nperhaps  it  could  be an independent  service  having\r\n\r\nprospects of advancement within itself. But because we\r\n\r\ncannot  here  conform  to Establishment  practice  and\r\n\r\nrules  outside  Singapore, we must not therefore  deny\r\n\r\nthat there is not a problem here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to take up much time because I hear the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lirn wants to speak also.

And  Government,  as  well  as   the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  making an inquiry into the whole  problem\r\n\r\nand  reporting  to the whole House? If  he  agrees  to\r\n\r\nthat, I am quite happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, if it is just an assurance\r\n\r\nthat a Committee making recommendations will make  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park happy, I am completely all  in\r\n\r\nfavour   of   making  him  happy.  But   provided   he\r\n\r\nunderstands  that  the position of the  Establishment,\r\n\r\nwhich  we  support,  is that a man  is  either  in  or\r\n\r\noutside  the  Government service. That  is  the  basic\r\n\r\nprinciple  from which we analyse or view any proposal.\r\n\r\nIf  the Member for Farrer Park understands that and at\r\n\r\nthe  same time he wants a Committee to try and find  a\r\n\r\nway to fit in that principle, I say, by all means. The\r\n\r\nproblem  has been viewed from almost every conceivable\r\n\r\nangle,  not  least  of all by you, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause you are the person most closely connected with\r\n\r\nit  and  the  person upon whom the problem  is  always\r\n\r\npressing.  But  unless there is  a  novel  proposition\r\n\r\nwhich  is  like  the Gordian knot  and  a  knife  cuts\r\n\r\nthrough it all, I do not see how we can get out  of  a\r\n\r\nvery  simple  proposition.

What  I  am\r\n\r\ninterested  in is this, that the checks  and  balances\r\n\r\nshould  be  such  that  there  would  not  even  be  a\r\n\r\nsuspicion of doubt in the minds of the Assembly  staff\r\n\r\nthat  somebody could bring pressure to hear  on  them.\r\n\r\nThe system should be such that nobody from any side of\r\n\r\nthe House could bring pressure to bear on the Assembly\r\n\r\nstaff.  That is the point I wish to make.  Surely  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance can understand that the  present\r\n\r\nposition  is  such that if there were an  unreasonable\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, such as somebody not  like  our\r\n\r\npresent  Minister, it could become difficult. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  point  I  am  trying to make.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance must accept that position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise really\r\n\r\nto endorse the point made by the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\nI do not think the survival of parliamentary democracy\r\n\r\nin  Malaya  is  really in Malaya or  Malaysia.  Either\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy survives or it is  changed  to\r\n\r\nsome other form of government. It does not depend upon\r\n\r\nthe  question of whether some 15 or 20 persons in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Legislative Assembly are in the  Government\r\n\r\nservice or in the Legislative Assembly service. I mean\r\n\r\nthese  are forms and trappings which are desirable  if\r\n\r\nthey  fit  the actual conditions. More important  than\r\n\r\nthat,  I  am  sure  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  is\r\n\r\ngenuinely and sincerely interested in seeing that  the\r\n\r\nform of government is not changed for the worse. I say\r\n\r\nwe could better spend our time ensuring that by seeing\r\n\r\nthat the organs of the State are not undermined\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  altogether gone. Then you will have a Legislature\r\n\r\nhere  and  everybody will say \"Ah, yes,  that  is  the\r\n\r\nedict  from the Legislature.\" But where is the  where-withal to carry out the edicts of the Legislature?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many more important factors which will\r\n\r\ndecide whether or not the democratic free will of  the\r\n\r\npeople expressed at regular intervals during elections\r\n\r\ncan  continue. One of them depends really not so  much\r\n\r\nupon  the  formalism, the ritual or the constitutional\r\n\r\nguarantees.   I  am  not  saying  that  constitutional\r\n\r\nguarantees  are not important and that  things  should\r\n\r\nnot  be under-written as hard as they can be. But what\r\n\r\nI  would  like to remind the House is that it is  more\r\n\r\nimportant  not  only the people in this  Chamber,  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people play according  to  the\r\n\r\nrules  of  the  Chamber,  but  that  political  forces\r\n\r\noutside  are not allowed to get out of hand to prevent\r\n\r\nthe  free  inter-play  in a free democratic  exchange.\r\n\r\nThat  is really the reality of the power. We are  here\r\n\r\nconcerned  with the facade. Not unnaturally  when  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill  was  in  charge,  he  was  not\r\n\r\ninterested in the facade, but he was interested in the\r\n\r\nreality.  And  the reality is not in this  Chamber - the\r\n\r\nnice  and sweet things that are done. If you  want  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the system from taking a turn for the  worse,\r\n\r\nthen  other things have to be done. One of  the  first\r\n\r\nthings  we  should do in this Chamber  to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nsemblance  of  democracy is to see that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nabuse of the privileges of Members: that there is none\r\n\r\nof   the   distortion  and  malicious  lying  of   the\r\n\r\nintentions  of  this House and so  on.  That  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant - the  prestige  of  the  Chamber;  more  than\r\n\r\nwhether  the Clerk, the Second Clerk or the  Reporters\r\n\r\nare  in  the  Government service or in the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  service. That is a triviality. If, in  fact,\r\n\r\npeople outside come to the conclusion that this  is  a\r\n\r\nmad  House - quite frankly, the Members of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis (particularly the Member for Upper Serangoon)\r\n\r\ntold  me this, that the last time when we raised' the.\r\n\r\nquestion  of privilege in connection with  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim, who properly resigned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  the  crucial  moment came.

In  the\r\n\r\nname  of  Western  parliamentary democracy,  they  say\r\n\r\nthis,  that  and the other. It is all in the  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders, adopted unanimously in this Assembly by  them.\r\n\r\nWe  played according to the rules. They said, \"No\"  to\r\n\r\nour motion on Thursday last. There was no protest.  It\r\n\r\nwas,  their  right to say no. General assent  was  not\r\n\r\ngiven.  We  could not debate the parents' appeal  for\r\n\r\npolice protection.

Therefore, things were\r\n\r\ndone.  But  they held it up for two days.  They  said,\r\n\r\n\"No\" on Thursday. We could not debate it on Friday. We\r\n\r\nhad  to wait till Monday.

In\r\n\r\nthat  respect. Mr Speaker, it is important  that  the\r\n\r\nmembers who form this Commission should, like Caesar's\r\n\r\nwife, be above reproach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the recent inquiry where the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  was  before  the  Chua Commission,  a  number  of\r\n\r\npersons  from  the  Public  Service  Commission   gave\r\n\r\nevidence,  of  whom  one was  Mr  Lim  Kim  San.  The\r\n\r\nquestion was asked of Mr Lim Kim San whether he was a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the People's Action Party. The answer  was\r\n\r\nyes.  A further question following on that was whether\r\n\r\nhe  had  made any contribution to the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty.  The  answer  was yes. But the  question  which\r\n\r\nshould  have followed on it was never asked. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  why.  But it was never asked. The question  that\r\n\r\nshould  have  been asked was, \"How much?\"  That  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion which is exercising the minds of the  public,\r\n\r\nlithe answer had been $10, perhaps it might have  been\r\n\r\nnothing.  But  if  the  answer had  been  $100,000  or\r\n\r\n$10,000, surely. Mr Speaker, Sir, it places  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nKim San vis-a-vis the Public Service Commission in  an\r\n\r\nunhappy position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great pity that question was not asked, and\r\n\r\nthat  no statement was made on it. The result is  that\r\n\r\nit  is felt that certain members of the Public Service\r\n\r\nCommission are intimately connected with the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party. Therefore, following on, that  premise,\r\n\r\nthe  suggestion is that people who are inclined to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. way of thinking, irrespective of how good or  how\r\n\r\nbad  they might be as civil servants, get preferential\r\n\r\ntreatment  before the Commission. I am not shooting  a\r\n\r\nline on this,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir. I can assure the Prime Minister  of\r\n\r\nthis,  because people are talking like  that  and  the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  are  talking and  thinking  in  those\r\n\r\nterms. It is therefore important for the Government 10\r\n\r\ndeclare  that  this is not so and  to  clear  all  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of whether they are sympathetic to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nway   of  political  thinking  or  whether  they  were\r\n\r\nappointed merely because the Government thought it was\r\n\r\nmerely  an  extension  of the arm  of  Government  for\r\n\r\nappointment  purposes and not for political  purposes.\r\n\r\nIt  is important because if the public services  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole  got  the impression that promotions were  being\r\n\r\neffected  not  on service merits hut on  other  merits\r\n\r\ntotally  unconnected  with and  unrelated  to  service\r\n\r\nconditions and service merits, then the whole  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service surely must deteriorate. Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nis  of public importance to have a complete, fair  and\r\n\r\nopen statement from the Government as to whether these\r\n\r\nsuspicions which are now being voiced and talked about\r\n\r\nhave  any foundation at all. I think the name  of  Mr\r\n\r\nLim Kim San should, in fairness to him, he cleared. He\r\n\r\nhas  been given honourable mention by the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  as  somebody who is doing a great service  to\r\n\r\nthe public. Mr Speaker, I myself know Mr Lim Kim San\r\n\r\nas  a very able gentleman. I have nothing against him,\r\n\r\nbut I think he is holding a public appointment of some\r\n\r\nimportance,  and therefore it is necessary  and  vital\r\n\r\nthat  his  name and his connection with  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party should he cleared in order that the  good\r\n\r\nname of the Public Service Commission be maintained so\r\n\r\nthat  it might effectively carry out the purposes  for\r\n\r\nwhich it was appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I only want\r\n\r\nto  speak about a number of difficulties and questions\r\n\r\non  the Public Service Commission because we feel,  as\r\n\r\nit  should be, that the independence of this  Assembly\r\n\r\nshould  be  enforced by the Public Service Commission.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  would  like  to know is  this  - would  it  be\r\n\r\npossible  to get an explanation of the resignation  of\r\n\r\nthe Chairman of the Public Service Commission?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApart  from that, who is the prospective Chairman?  In\r\n\r\nmy opinion, Mr Speaker, it is better to have - as in the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. today  there are so many communities -  in  this\r\n\r\nPublic  Service  Commission members of different  races\r\n\r\nand communities, like Malays, Indians and so on. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  because  I am not satisfied with the services  but\r\n\r\nbecause, Mr Speaker, outside this Assembly people  are\r\n\r\ntalking about it. If you do not believe me, you can ask\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Police,  immigration  officials   and\r\n\r\ncustoms  about appointments to higher ranks.  They  are\r\n\r\nnot  satisfied though they have served for a long  time\r\n\r\nand  have  qualified  in  the  national  language.  But\r\n\r\nbecause  of  several factors regarding  qualifications,\r\n\r\ngraduates of Nanyang University have been appointed  to\r\n\r\nhigher  posts. Because of the hope of independence  for\r\n\r\nthis  country, members of other races should also  hold\r\n\r\nsuch  posts. I would like to have a reply, because this\r\n\r\nhas  been discussed in U.M.N.O., especially in the East\r\n\r\nDivision, and I have been given the duty to communicate\r\n\r\nthis  to  this Assembly. On the appointments to  higher\r\n\r\nposts  based  on special privileges to the  Malays,  as\r\n\r\nmentioned in my questions to the Minister for  Finance,\r\n\r\nout  of  four of them, they took only one, Inche  Anwar\r\n\r\nIbrahim,  who  is now in the Ministry of Education.  He\r\n\r\nhas  been  appointed to a higher post. But as  for  the\r\n\r\nthree  others, Mr Speaker, it appears to me that  they\r\n\r\nare  not appointed to higher posts, but get by  way  of\r\n\r\nsalaries appointments in name only. The appointment  to\r\n\r\nhigher posts is exaggerated in the newspapers. I hope I\r\n\r\ncould  get a clearer explanation from the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation.  I just communicate to the Assembly  what  I\r\n\r\nhave been told to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI notice under Head 5 - Public Service Commission, there\r\n\r\nis one Chairman, one Deputy Chairman and three members.\r\n\r\nThat  makes  five. I believe none of  the  five  is  a\r\n\r\nwoman.  Sir, every year more and more girls pass  their\r\n\r\nSchool  Certificate examination, their  Chinese  Middle\r\n\r\nIII  or  their pre-university II examination, and  more\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  are  graduating from the University of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand Nanyang University.

Most of these women, Sir, are absorbed  into\r\n\r\nGovernment service. I had a chat with the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation and I asked him whether it was true that more\r\n\r\nand  more women were being absorbed into the Government\r\n\r\nservice.  His  reply  was, \"Of  course,  otherwise  our\r\n\r\nsociety  would  not be progressing.\" Sir,  I  was  just\r\n\r\nwondering whether it would not be a sign of progress in\r\n\r\nour  society  to have one or two women  in  the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission. When the Public Service Commission\r\n\r\nwas  first  appointed  some  years  ago,  there  was  a\r\n\r\ncomparatively  smaller  number of  women  entering  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  service.  Now that the  number  is  rapidly\r\n\r\nswelling, is it not logical and fair to have  at  least\r\n\r\none woman as a member of the Public Service Commission?\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  not suggesting that the Government  should\r\n\r\nincrease their expenditure by enlarging the Commission.\r\n\r\nNeither  am  I  suggesting that  one  unfortunate  male\r\n\r\nmember should be replaced by a woman. But I do ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  if on future occasions they have  to  make\r\n\r\nmore  appointments,  whether they would  keep  this  in\r\n\r\nmind.  Because it is not only for my sake  or  for  the\r\n\r\nsake  of  women in Singapore, but for the sake  of  all\r\n\r\nwomen  throughout  the  world  who  are  interested  in\r\n\r\nraising  the status of women. I am not trying to  be  a\r\n\r\nfeminist - it  seems  to  be quite  a  joke,  I  hear - and\r\n\r\nneither  must  this question be treated as unimportant,\r\n\r\nas  is  every other question concerning women. Whenever\r\n\r\nsuch  a  question comes up, it is greeted with laughter\r\n\r\nand  treated  as if it is unimportant. It is  important\r\n\r\nenough,  Sir,  to find a place in the U.N.  Charter  on\r\n\r\nHuman  Rights  where they ask for equal privileges  and\r\n\r\nequal   treatment  for  women.  The  P.A.P. has   also\r\n\r\nadvocated  the  same  principle.  That  is  why  I   am\r\n\r\nappealing  to the Government to give this a thought  in\r\n\r\nmaking future appointments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, for one moment I thought we\r\n\r\nwere in the United Nations!

Both the Member for Cairnhill  and\r\n\r\nhis  predecessor, the Member for Anson, will know that\r\n\r\nthis  was  one  of  the items that  was  acrimoniously\r\n\r\ndebated   in   the   course  of   our   constitutional\r\n\r\nconferences in London. First, the Member for Anson led\r\n\r\nthe  delegation - he led two subsequent ones.  On  both\r\n\r\noccasions  there was acrimonious debate on whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  should inherit the former P.S.C. It was generally\r\n\r\nagreed, after a bit of acrimony, that it was the right\r\n\r\nof  the  Government to nominate the P.S.C. there  are\r\n\r\nvalid,  cogent reasons for that conclusion  which  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill, as Chief Minister then, pressed\r\n\r\nand  the  Secretary of State for the  Colonies  agreed\r\n\r\nwith  him. For the benefit of his colleague the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Farrer  Park,  who  was  not  present   at   the\r\n\r\nconferences,  may  I  enumerate some  of  the  reasons\r\n\r\nadvanced jointly? I think the Member for Geylang Serai\r\n\r\nwill  bear  witness with me. Firstly,  the  Government\r\n\r\nthat  comes  into  office will be inheriting  a  State\r\n\r\nmachine  which had been built up largely by expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers in the past. Therefore, it was necessary that\r\n\r\nthe  men  who  were  to decide on a  large  number  of\r\n\r\npromotions   which  were  going  to  take   place   as\r\n\r\nMalayanisation progressed should reflect the political\r\n\r\nthinking  of  the new generation of rulers  who  would\r\n\r\ntake the place of the British administrators. The  men\r\n\r\nwho  were appointed by former Governors reflected  the\r\n\r\nthinking  of  one  era. The men who have  taken  their\r\n\r\nplaces  must  reflect the thinking  of  the  new  age.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is impossible for the Government to be at\r\n\r\nvariance with the background, the thinking and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  philosophy  of  members of the  P.S.C. for  long\r\n\r\nwithout there being serious acrimony. Behind all  this\r\n\r\nfacade   of   independence  of  the   judiciary,   the\r\n\r\nindependence of the Legislature - when I used  the  word\r\n\r\n\"facade\"  I  used it in a very liberal sense,  in  the\r\n\r\nsense  that behind the constitutional guarantees,  the\r\n\r\noutward  symbols of separateness, there  must  be  the\r\n\r\nreality of effective government. If you have a  P.S.C.\r\n\r\nthat keeps on promoting or recruiting people whom  the\r\n\r\nGovernment feels it has no confidence in, then a point\r\n\r\nis  reached  where things come to a break. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park  is not altogether  unaware  of  the\r\n\r\naffairs of government. He has been in local government\r\n\r\nfor years. You face the same problem there. If you are\r\n\r\nto inherit a machine manned in key positions by people\r\n\r\non  whom  you  place no reliance, then  how  does  the\r\n\r\nmachine  work?  It  is as simple as  that.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwritten  into the Constitution as a safeguard  against\r\n\r\nvariance  of opinion of the P.S.C. and the  Ministers,\r\n\r\nthe Permanent Secretary appointments are to be made by\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister from a list given by the P.S.C.  If\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister does not like it, he sends back the\r\n\r\nlist  and  asks for another list. The office of  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General  is  an  appointment  of  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.   The   office  of  Chief  Justice   is   an\r\n\r\nappointment of the Prime Minister. The office  of  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Arbitration Court is an appointment of\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister. The office of the Speaker, Sir, is\r\n\r\nan appointment of the Government Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind all the theories of separation of power,\r\n\r\nbehind all the niceties of the independence of action,\r\n\r\njudgment,  decision, the checks and  balances  of  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system,  there  must  be  the  reality  of\r\n\r\neffective cohesiveness. We have appointed five men  on\r\n\r\nthe  P.S.C. - six  so far; the present  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara was our first appointment; he vacated his  post\r\n\r\non  the  P.S.C. when  he became the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara.  They were men unconnected with the P.A.P. in\r\n\r\nthe  sense  that they were politically  involved.  The\r\n\r\nrules  of the Constitution were observed. But  let  me\r\n\r\ntell the Member for Farrer Park this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously we would never appoint anybody in  whom  we\r\n\r\nhave  no  confidence to the P.S.C. or to any board  on\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have  the right of appointment.  The  first\r\n\r\nthing   we  must  have  is  confidence  in  the  man's\r\n\r\njudgment. How do you get that confidence? Because  you\r\n\r\nknow him. If you do not know him, how do you know  you\r\n\r\ncan rely on his judgment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to clear Mr Lim Kim San. First of all, I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Member for Farrer Park was wrong  when  he\r\n\r\nsaid that Mr Lim Kim San said that he was a member of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  He  never  was.  He  never  said  in  the\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry that he was a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  He said that he was not a member of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nHe  was asked whether he gave a donation to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAfter  he  was  appointed, he was  approached  by  the\r\n\r\nTreasurer of the Party who came to know him because he\r\n\r\nwas  appointed the Chairman of the Housing  Board  and\r\n\r\nthe  Housing Board and Allocation Committees  to  help\r\n\r\nhim in awarding points and so on.

He is\r\n\r\ndoing  the  job for nothing in the Housing Board.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer  Park knew that  we  offered  that\r\n\r\nappointment on the Housing Board to a friend  of  his.\r\n\r\nIt  was a tough job because the Minister then was  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim and we needed another tough man to\r\n\r\ndo  the  job properly so that the checks and  balances\r\n\r\ncould work. But the reality of power is this - you  have\r\n\r\na  tough  Minister - whatever you  do,  the  balance  of\r\n\r\nauthority  is finally decided by who has to carry  the\r\n\r\ncan,  for he who carries the responsibility must  ipso\r\n\r\nfacto  have the right to decide.

It  was  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson, when he was Chief Minister, who fixed\r\n\r\nthis  salary.  The second Chief Minister,  namely,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill, also received $3,500 a month  as\r\n\r\nhis salary.

He knew that we reduced the allowances  of\r\n\r\nour public servants because we wanted to economise  on\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditure. That was why in July  1959  we\r\n\r\nreduced the allowances of our public servants. At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  we reduced the salaries of the  Ministers\r\n\r\nand    the   Parliamentary   Secretaries.   The    ex-Parliamentary  Secretary  himself  drew  a  salary  of\r\n\r\n$1,500  a month, but later on it was reduced to $1,250\r\n\r\na  month.  We  made progress in the Government  partly\r\n\r\nbecause of the support and help of the people who  are\r\n\r\nnow  in the Barisan Sosialis. We did this so that  the\r\n\r\neconomy  of our State would be more stable.  But  when\r\n\r\nour  economy  improved and things turned out  for  the\r\n\r\nbetter, we decided to restore the allowances in  full.\r\n\r\nI  regret  very  much to have heard the  arguments  he\r\n\r\nraised  just  now. If he had not been  manipulated  by\r\n\r\nothers,  he would still have been receiving  $1,500  a\r\n\r\nmonth   now.

But  his  dream  is  now\r\n\r\nshattered,  and there is another person assisting  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  take charge of education  problems.

This  has   to   be\r\n\r\nunderstood clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers, of course, must be put on a higher status\r\n\r\nthan  that  of the ex-Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Education.

That  is  to  help our  communication  and\r\n\r\nconversation with our ex-Parliamentary Secretary. That\r\n\r\nis  why  we  had to spend time learning  languages  in\r\n\r\nspite of the fact that we had much work to do. When he\r\n\r\nwas   Parliamentary  Secretary  in  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation, I used to encourage him to learn languages.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  he  has  given up learning languages  due  to\r\n\r\npressure  of work and time. But how is it that  as  an\r\n\r\nAssemblyman  he could draw an allowance  for  learning\r\n\r\nlanguages and I could not? I should also have the same\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned just now another kind of allowance.\r\n\r\nWhat was that?

During the debate on the first  two\r\n\r\namendments,  we took 25 minutes. The Prime Minister,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  took 20 minutes just to explain that it  was  a\r\n\r\nrestoration  of self-imposed pay cuts. In  fact,  as  I\r\n\r\npointed out in this Assembly before, it was nothing but\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis. We do  not  want\r\n\r\nthat  to  happen, particularly in this  Budget  debate,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  a  very tight schedule.  There  is  also  a\r\n\r\nguillotine  on  the time allotted for matters  of  this\r\n\r\nkind.  Out  of 22 amendments, Sir, I have 16  under  my\r\n\r\nname.  As a result of too much time spent on the  first\r\n\r\ntwo  amendments,  we  have to rush  through  the  other\r\n\r\namendments under the Head of Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Prime Minister to explain why it is\r\n\r\nthat in the case of Political Secretaries, an increase\r\n\r\nof  $250  is  suggested. There is no such thing  as  a\r\n\r\nrestoration of pay cut, because there was no  pay  cut\r\n\r\nimposed on Political Secretaries. I would like  it  to\r\n\r\nbe  understood here, Sir, that I have nothing  against\r\n\r\nthe   Political  Secretary  in  the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice.  I know him personally. But I am raising  this\r\n\r\nas  a  matter  of principle. The Political  Secretary,\r\n\r\nSir, according to the Government, is there to tell the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned about the pulse of the people.  The\r\n\r\npolitical Secretary in question, Sir, contested the by-election  in  Hong Lim. He went to  Hong  Lim  as  the\r\n\r\ndefender  of  the  P.A.P. and lost. He  was,  therefore,\r\n\r\nrejected  by  the electorate of Hong Lim.  If  Members\r\n\r\nwill  remember, when the P.A.P. Government  came  into\r\n\r\npower,  they  made short shrift of all candidates  who\r\n\r\nlost  in the general elections, so much so that  those\r\n\r\nin  the  Opposition who had been active  in  community\r\n\r\ncentres and other voluntary organisations were  shoo'd\r\n\r\noff  by  the then Minister for Labour and Law  on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  that  they were unwanted by the people.  They\r\n\r\nwere  rejected by the electorate of the division  they\r\n\r\nstood  for.  Therefore, they should not be  given  the\r\n\r\nchance to serve the people in any capacity whatsoever.\r\n\r\nHere we have the case of a Political Secretary who had\r\n\r\nbeen rejected by the electorate of Hong Lim. Yet he is\r\n\r\nthe Political Secretary to the Prime Minister. Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink, as a result of that, it is not out of place  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Prime Minister whether or not this Political\r\n\r\nSecretary drew any salary during the time of  the  by-election campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Mohd.

We were told that the past Political Secretaries\r\n\r\nlike  Fong Swee Suan, Lim Ching Siong, and S. Woodhull\r\n\r\nwere  made Political Secretaries because they were  to\r\n\r\nserve  as  a  bridge  between the Government  and  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order.

Dr\r\n\r\nLee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, as far as I understand,\r\n\r\nSir, they served as Political Secretaries because  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister insisted -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come on!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - that if they wanted to show that\r\n\r\nthey  were  loyal to the P.A.P., they had to  shoulder\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of Government policy. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  defended  Lim  Ching  Siong.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  also defended all of them. But we know  what\r\n\r\nthe  real purpose was. The real purpose, Sir,  was  to\r\n\r\nuse the names of these persons as a cover for anything\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government thought was unpopular  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  could enlist the support of workers in  whatever\r\n\r\npolicies they wanted to implement. But what happens to\r\n\r\nthe present Political Secretaries? I do not want to be\r\n\r\npersonal, Sir. I know them personally myself.  But  of\r\n\r\nwhat use are they now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You will be surprised!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Are they serving as bridges\r\n\r\nbetween the Party in power and the people? Or are they\r\n\r\nmere translators? You will remember, Sir, in the first\r\n\r\nSession that the Prime Minister himself said that  but\r\n\r\nfor  the  fact  that they had a Malay  translator  who\r\n\r\ncould  translate  the  speech of the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara,  it  was possible that the real  speech  would\r\n\r\nhave  been  misunderstood. As  far  as  we  know,  all\r\n\r\ntranslators are only given a certain salary and  never\r\n\r\nas  high as it is put down. Since the coffers  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are  also  depleted  and  are  not  so  easily\r\n\r\nreplenished,   I   wonder  whether  they   need   more\r\n\r\ncontributions from the Political Secretaries and other\r\n\r\npeople like them. We have nothing personal against the\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretaries, Sir. If they  really  want  to\r\n\r\nserve  their  purpose, they must be sent back  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  They must not stay in air-conditioned offices\r\n\r\nand  just  translate speeches and writings of  certain\r\n\r\npeople.  Such  jobs can easily be delegated  to  civil\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Member for Cairnhill has asked a question\r\n\r\nabout  the pay of the Political Secretary to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  during the by-election, I must mention  that\r\n\r\nwe know that the then acting Political Secretary never\r\n\r\nreceived  a  single  cent. All the  money  which  that\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary was supposed to have received went\r\n\r\nto  the coffers of the P.A.P. instead.

The second  point\r\n\r\nis  the  increase of $250. I take it  that  it  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease  to  all Political Secretaries. We  can  deal\r\n\r\nwith that. Thirdly, I think possibly the question will\r\n\r\narise  in each particular Ministry whether a Political\r\n\r\nSecretary  should be engaged. What  use  they  are.  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest then that we deal with the two heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

We, together with the help of the 13 Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Assemblymen  and the three  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nU.P.P.,  defended  it. I need hardly  say,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\npeople  who  changed their minds  so  quickly  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  four months leaves others in doubt  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether they are stable, apart from financial matters,\r\n\r\nSir,Instability in financial matters is  one  thing,\r\n\r\nparticularly when one considers the loss of  earnings.\r\n\r\nBut  general instability - questioning basic  principles\r\n\r\nwhich they supported and voted for - is another thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mental\r\n\r\ninstability!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Oh, mental instability.

They  were  the people  who  defended  and\r\n\r\nsupported it.

He\r\n\r\nhad  his present Secretary-General there. He must  know\r\n\r\nwhat  a useful man he was. To the Member for Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nmay  I  say  this?  He  knows very well  how  extremely\r\n\r\nvaluable  my Political Secretary is, and how  extremely\r\n\r\nvaluable  the  Political Secretary to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  is.  I  am  sorry the  Member  for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nbelieves that they only translate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can translate, and translate many things, Sir.\r\n\r\nYou  can translate words. You can translate ideas. What\r\n\r\nis  most  important is that there has  been  some  good\r\n\r\ntranslation   of  ideas  into  action, much   to   the\r\n\r\ndiscomfiture   of   the  Member  for   Queenstown,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, the discomfiture of his own colleague,  the\r\n\r\nformer  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation.   He   had  a  chat  with  my  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  over the predecessor. Strangely  enough,  he\r\n\r\nhas  only  asked  a very simple question  of  principle\r\n\r\nabout  the  increase, which I now  propose  to  answer.\r\n\r\nObviously my Political Secretary is a man of  very  few\r\n\r\nwords  and  the few words he spoke sank home.  Why  the\r\n\r\nincrease?  When the salary was fixed at  $1,100,  their\r\n\r\nposition  vis-a-vis  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  was\r\n\r\ntaken into consideration. In any organisation there  is\r\n\r\na certain amount of formality, protocol; who gives whom\r\n\r\norders; whose authority over-rides whom. The salary  of\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary was fixed at $1,500;  that  of\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary was fixed at $1,350. Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries  were  brought down to  $1,250.  Well,  the\r\n\r\nadjustment was already made before the appointment - just\r\n\r\nlike the P.S.C., and if I may mention it, the Speaker's\r\n\r\nemolument - it already contained the variable  allowance.\r\n\r\nWhen we fixed the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary's salary, it was already after  the\r\n\r\npay  cuts;  so we fixed it at $1,100. When we  restored\r\n\r\nthe  pay cut, we restored it all round. May I say this,\r\n\r\nSir?  If  we  wanted just to give largesse  around,  we\r\n\r\ncould  fill  up all nine appointments, because  we  had\r\n\r\nnine  appointments right from the word 'go'.  We  never\r\n\r\ndid.  We  have never appointed more than  five  or  six\r\n\r\nPolitica1 Secretaries. Mr Devan Nair resigned for  his\r\n\r\nown personal reasons, and not because he disagreed with\r\n\r\nthe  Government: because he would have been accused  of\r\n\r\nbeing a stooge of the Government. He knew the fight was\r\n\r\ncoming, and  if he was in receipt of pay as  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary, they would say he did it because  he  was  a\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary.  So he  resigned,  went  back  to\r\n\r\nteaching,  and waited for the scrap which he  knew  was\r\n\r\ncoming.  Because once he knew Mr Lim Ching  Siong  and\r\n\r\nMr  Fong  Swee  Suan were going to play the  Communist\r\n\r\ngame,  then  the  fight  was  inevitable.

Up\r\n\r\ntill  now  we have not been able to find the people  we\r\n\r\nwant.  We  could appoint anybody and fill  up  all  the\r\n\r\njobs.  As for the acting Political Secretary, when  Mr\r\n\r\nJek  was  at  Hong  Lim canvassing and  campaigning,  I\r\n\r\nappointed our editor of Petir to be my acting Political\r\n\r\nSecretary.

I\r\n\r\ncongratulate   the  chaps  who  manipulated   the   13\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  into making them believe that  they  were\r\n\r\ngoing to be Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\ndraw  big  salaries. In the end they lost money.  They\r\n\r\nall look thinner and hungrier now. They were extremely\r\n\r\nunhappy  at  the thought of reducing the Assemblymen's\r\n\r\nallowances.   The  Member  for  Queenstown   suggested\r\n\r\nincreasing  it. Be that as it may, I ask  each  Member\r\n\r\nthis  very simple question - which the public will  ask.\r\n\r\nIf  we  are  throwing public money away, why  have  we\r\n\r\nnever  filled up the jobs yet? There are nine jobs  to\r\n\r\ngive  away.  We  filled up six because  six  men  were\r\n\r\navailable, and we filled them up for good reasons. One\r\n\r\nresigned to go back to teaching because he anticipated\r\n\r\nthe  day  when  we would part company and  they  would\r\n\r\nsmear  him. He did not want that. He did not  want  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  hostage to fortune. We knew two  had  already\r\n\r\ngone  the  other  way and were waiting  for  the  open\r\n\r\nconflict.

We had  two\r\n\r\nfortunately - my   own  Political  Secretary   and   the\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary to the Minister for Culture - who we\r\n\r\nknew were stout-hearted men. They went into the valley\r\n\r\nin  the  shadow  of death and came  out  as  firm  of\r\n\r\nconviction as when they went through the worst  of  it\r\n\r\nall.  They did not believe they were going to get more\r\n\r\nsalary when they stuck with us. Everybody expected  us\r\n\r\nto  go  down.  But they have conviction  and  courage,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  more than what I can say for  some  of  the\r\n\r\nothers.  It is certainly more than what I can say  for\r\n\r\nthe  13  gentlemen sitting opposite, honourable though\r\n\r\nthey  may  be  by being in this Assembly,  because  we\r\n\r\nfought  for  them on our symbol, P.A.P.,  and  on  our\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first and\r\n\r\nforemost,  I  am  not satisfied with  the  explanation\r\n\r\ngiven by the Prime Minister that it was a readjustment\r\n\r\nof  salary.  Sir,  in the case of  the  Ministers  and\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries,  I  accept  the  statement\r\n\r\nbecause  those  salaries were drawn by  Ministers  and\r\n\r\nAssistant Ministers of the previous Government. In the\r\n\r\ncase  of  a  Parliamentary Secretary, this was  a  new\r\n\r\nappointment.  Then  to prove my  contention  that  the\r\n\r\nstatement of the Prime Minister is wrong, let me refer\r\n\r\nhim to page 427, Head 49. Ministry of Culture. Head 49\r\n\r\ncarries  with  it  two political appointments - Personal\r\n\r\nSecretary (Political), i.e.. Political Secretary,  and\r\n\r\nPublicity Liaison Secretary (Political), that is, Sir.\r\n\r\nitem  (3)  of  subhead 1. When we queried  the  salary\r\n\r\nfixed  for the Publicity Liaison Secretary (Political)\r\n\r\nat $1,400 - when Political Secretaries were paid $1,100 - it  was pointed out to us in this Assembly (and I have\r\n\r\nthe  Hansard  to prove it) that the Publicity  Liaison\r\n\r\nSecretary was being paid $1,400 because of his greater\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  Therefore,  there  was  already   a\r\n\r\nrelationship between the salary scale of the Political\r\n\r\nSecretary and that of the Publicity Liaison Secretary.\r\n\r\nNow, it will be seen from Head 49, item (3) of subhead\r\n\r\n1,  that  the  salary of Publicity  Liaison  Secretary\r\n\r\nstill remains at $1,400.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, as a result of that, I contend that that was\r\n\r\nthe  salary  fixed  for  the  job - Publicity  Liaison\r\n\r\nSecretary   $1,400  and  Political  Secretary   $1,100.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to increase an extra $250 for the  Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries now is just to give extra money  to  people\r\n\r\nwho support the Party in power:.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the other explanation given by the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  in  regard to his Political  Secretary\r\n\r\nduring  the  time  of  the  Hong  Lim  by-election,  he\r\n\r\ndisclosed a very scandalous state of affairs.  He  said\r\n\r\nthat at that time his Political Secretary resigned.  If\r\n\r\nhe  had  resigned, let it be. But what did he  do?  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister filled up the post with the  editor  of\r\n\r\nhis paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Fill it up and then take the money\r\n\r\nfor his Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That was what he did.

What I do suggest\r\n\r\nis  this.  The fact that the Political Secretaries  who\r\n\r\nhave  now  resigned have been labelled by  him  in  his\r\n\r\nawful  disclosures  in  12  broadcasts  as  Communists,\r\n\r\nfellow-travellers, Communist front men. Those  are  the\r\n\r\nwords  used  by the Prime Minister. So the  reason  why\r\n\r\nthere  were  some posts not filled is that he  had  not\r\n\r\nenough Communist comrades there to contain. He need not\r\n\r\nhave  to use the posts, but he puts them in so that  in\r\n\r\ncase there are some Communist fellows whom he wants  to\r\n\r\ncontain, he will contain them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there are logical questions\r\n\r\nwhich I think the Member for Cairnhill should answer if\r\n\r\nhe makes this scandalous allegation, if we want to fill\r\n\r\nour party coffers, Sir, there are other simple ways  of\r\n\r\ndoing  it. The power of patronage of a government under\r\n\r\nthis Constitution is 10 times the power of patronage of\r\n\r\na government under his. We can account for every single\r\n\r\ncent  the Party has received and spent, which  is  more\r\n\r\nthan  I can say for some other Parties, which he  knows\r\n\r\nabout.  We get nothing from America, as did the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Party.  Nor do we fill our coffers  in  the  way\r\n\r\nsuggested  by  the  Member for Cairnhill - disreputable\r\n\r\nand  dishonourable. These men work for their money.  So\r\n\r\ndid every one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministers,  every one  of  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries,  and every one of us who  contributes  to\r\n\r\nkeep  the Party going as a machine-not to get together\r\n\r\na  few  chaps at election time to fight the elections.\r\n\r\nIf  we  want to make the money for nothing,  we  could\r\n\r\nhave  filled up the nine posts. We have lots of  Party\r\n\r\nworkers   - editors,   assistant  editors,   organising\r\n\r\nsecretaries. We could have filled up every one of  the\r\n\r\nnine  posts.  But  the people must be worth  something\r\n\r\nbefore  we  put them there. It is as simple  as  that.\r\n\r\nWhen I got the editor of Petir to take over, I had  to\r\n\r\nhave  one in my Ministry for various reasons.  Because\r\n\r\nin  my capacity, I have charge of the Government,  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council,  and the Party. I had to have  somebody\r\n\r\nthere  who  could be on tab. When Mr Jek was  running\r\n\r\naround fighting the Hong Lim by-election, I had to get\r\n\r\nthe  editor  of Petir to look after Mr Jek's  duties.\r\n\r\nThat  is all, and there is nothing wrong with it.  Mr\r\n\r\nJek's  money was paid into the Party, and so was  this\r\n\r\ngentleman's money paid into the Party, and  they  were\r\n\r\nboth  paid  out of the Party. And so is my money  paid\r\n\r\ninto  the  Party and paid out to me every month,  less\r\n\r\nthan  what I receive from the Government. That is  how\r\n\r\nwe  run  our  Party. I do not want to be  mischievous,\r\n\r\nSir,  because  I think the past should  be  forgotten,\r\n\r\nparticularly  by those whose past cannot bear  looking\r\n\r\ninto. The Member for Tanglin suggests a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry. I think he did not consult some of his chaps.\r\n\r\nI  could have a Commission and reopen the whole of the\r\n\r\nChew  Swee Kee case, although he has run away to  Ipoh\r\n\r\nand  will not come back here. But I could do a lot  of\r\n\r\nunpleasant things to the chaps. We are a clean  Party.\r\n\r\nWe  will  stay that way. We receive nothing  from  the\r\n\r\nAmericans. We receive nothing illegal and improper. We\r\n\r\ndo  not even appoint people when we have the power  to\r\n\r\ndo that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it really suggested that we are misusing our power\r\n\r\nof  patronage  just to fill up the party coffers?  For\r\n\r\nwhat?  To  ruin the reputation of our Party? Half  the\r\n\r\nstrength  of  the Party lies in the fact  that  people\r\n\r\nknow it is an honest Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne  may  or may not agree with the Party, but  nobody\r\n\r\nbelieves  that we are hanging on - I for $3,000  and  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues for $2,500. Surely we are made of a  little\r\n\r\nbit of sterner stuff than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I ask the Member for Cairnhill not to be\r\n\r\ncarried  away  by this. I do not want to  hurt  people\r\n\r\nunnecessarily.  I heard an allegation against  a  very\r\n\r\ngood  friend of mine, Mr Lim Kim San, and I  defended\r\n\r\nhim with heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Political Secretary went through a lot with\r\n\r\nme. I would trust him implicitly. On 20th July, whilst\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Farrer Park  thought  we  were  just\r\n\r\nenacting a little bit of party politics here, we  were\r\n\r\nliterally  going through life and death,  because  had\r\n\r\nthey  undermined and convinced others that  they  were\r\n\r\ngoing  to  win  and stampeded others, a  very  serious\r\n\r\nposition would have arisen. He played a very important\r\n\r\nrole in stabilising it. I say, I will stand by him any\r\n\r\ntime, any place, as a gentleman of some character  and\r\n\r\nsome  worth.  He went to prison for his  beliefs.  The\r\n\r\nformer Chief Minister put him there. He came out,  and\r\n\r\nhe  told the former Chief Minister that he was joining\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. and not joining the Labour Front.  And  I\r\n\r\nsay, credit to the Chief Minister for letting him  out\r\n\r\nknowing that he was joining the P.A.P. He went through\r\n\r\nwith  us  and  we  will stand by him. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens knows the quality of Mr Jek  Yuen\r\n\r\nThong  and very wisely says very little. I advise  him\r\n\r\nto  say  very  little on this because I  do  not  want\r\n\r\nunnecessarily  to praise Mr Jek Yuen Thong's  virtues\r\n\r\nvis-a-vis  the  Member for Upper Serangoon  but  I  am\r\n\r\nquite prepared to wade in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the fact that the money that\r\n\r\nwas   to  have  been  paid  to  the  acting  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary was paid into the coffers of the P.A.P. was\r\n\r\ndisclosed  by the Prime Minister. I did not  make  any\r\n\r\nallegation, but I do say that it was not right to this\r\n\r\nextent.  The  Political Secretary  went  on  leave  to\r\n\r\ncontest  the by-election. His post could not  be  left\r\n\r\nfor  a  month.  It had to be filled by the  editor  of\r\n\r\ntheir own Party\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norgan.  His salary was taken into the Party,  and  the\r\n\r\nParty paid him what his salary was as an editor.  That\r\n\r\nwas  what  the Prime Minister said. But in  his  five-minute  speech  just  now, he  did  not  make  another\r\n\r\nattempt to explain away the increase of $250.  It  was\r\n\r\nnot  normal, because if it was normal, then the salary\r\n\r\nof  the Publicity Liaison Secretary in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture fixed at $1,400 is therefore not correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir,It\r\n\r\nwas  an  oversight. The reason why the $1,400 was  not\r\n\r\nincreased is that that post was never filled. There is\r\n\r\nno holder of that post since it was left vacant. May I\r\n\r\nsay  this? These are all patronage positions. We could\r\n\r\nmake  more - and  we have more - in statutory  boards  and\r\n\r\nvarious  other  bodies. If patronage is  how  a  Party\r\n\r\nenriches  itself, we could do it easily. The post  has\r\n\r\nnot been filled because there has been no man suitable\r\n\r\nfor  it.  The men who fill these jobs have to  satisfy\r\n\r\nour  needs  first. The only reason why the  salary  of\r\n\r\nthat post has not been increased, like the others,  is\r\n\r\nthat the post is still vacant. So when the restoration\r\n\r\nof the allowances took place, that post was vacant and\r\n\r\nit never took effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  if  they  wanted to give  these  posts  of\r\n\r\npatronage  because  of what they  have  done  for  the\r\n\r\nParty,  they  would have filled the other  posts.  The\r\n\r\ntruth of the matter is this. I think this is what took\r\n\r\nplace.  There  were a number of persons on  the  scene\r\n\r\nwhom they wanted to appoint to these posts. There were\r\n\r\nfive  or  six  of  them to whom they  wanted  to  give\r\n\r\nappointments.  Now they wanted to put these  into  the\r\n\r\nBudget  under the various Ministries.

He was then transferred to the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Now  if  there had been no  differences  of\r\n\r\nopinion  between Mr Fong Swee Suan and the Government\r\n\r\non  matters  of policy then the Deputy Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  have always been without a Political Secretary.\r\n\r\nSo, Mr Speaker, Sir, let us not put something across.\r\n\r\nLet  us  not really try and bluff the whole time.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has  succeeded in  bluffing  his  way\r\n\r\nthrough up till now. Let him not try and bluff all the\r\n\r\ntime.  You  can bluff some of the people some  of  the\r\n\r\ntime  but not all the time. If he thinks it is a  fair\r\n\r\nstatement   to  say  that  he  wants  these  Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries to help the Party, I accept it. But do not\r\n\r\ntry  to  pull the wool over our eyes all the time.  My\r\n\r\nquarrel with all these appointments now, Sir, is this.\r\n\r\nPurely  from the budgetary point of view - and  I  think\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Finance  should  take  an  active\r\n\r\ninterest  in  this - the intention of the Government  is\r\n\r\nnot to fill any of these posts now. Why should they be\r\n\r\ncarried  in  the Budget? The Minister for  Finance  is\r\n\r\nvery  particular about appointments. He always queries\r\n\r\nthe  departments, \"Do you want this post?\" If they  do\r\n\r\nwant  the  post  and it has not been  filled  for  two\r\n\r\nyears,  a query goes out. It is a normal query in  any\r\n\r\nfinancial  department,  \"These  posts  have  not  been\r\n\r\nfilled for two years.

If we wanted to loot, why did we bother to  put\r\n\r\nnine  posts in the Budget? A dishonest government  can\r\n\r\nloot  so quietly and effectively that the country will\r\n\r\nbe plundered. Let us be honest about these things. The\r\n\r\npowers  vested  in  the  Ministers  now  by  the   new\r\n\r\nConstitution  and the integration of the City  Council\r\n\r\ninto Government are those of the former Government - the\r\n\r\nChief   Secretary   and  the  Mayor.   The   Ministers\r\n\r\ncollectively exercise now all the powers of  patronage\r\n\r\nof the Governor, the Mayor and the Chief Secretary. We\r\n\r\ncan  stash away a lot of things without having  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough this Budget. I have made this point before and\r\n\r\nI  think  the  Member for Farrer  Park  has  tried  to\r\n\r\nexercise his mind to find out the reason. He  says  it\r\n\r\nis  a facade. That is not true. I will tell him why we\r\n\r\nput  in  nine posts. To begin with, I had  to  have  a\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary and I had made up my mind  before\r\n\r\nthe  elections  that Mr Jek was to  be  my  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary. I have been with him for a long time,  Sir,\r\n\r\nand I trust him. He is an extremely able man. He could\r\n\r\nhave been in this Assembly because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  could have taken any seat and  people  knew\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. was going to win. But he did not want\r\n\r\na  seat. He went out to Hong Lim to fight when he knew\r\n\r\nit was a tough fight and lost. He was prepared for it.\r\n\r\nI  could  give  hint patronage in a thousand  and  one\r\n\r\ndifferent ways. If that is what is required.  I  could\r\n\r\nappoint him to so many boards and stash away money for\r\n\r\nhim.  But  we openly put it through this vote  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly because he has to be my open political  aide.\r\n\r\nSimilarly. Inche Rahim Ishak helping the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture.  As for the others, let me explain  what  the\r\n\r\nposition  was  in  June  1959.  If  the  former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, the Member for Cairnhill, had read his files\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I do not know whether complete files were sent to him\r\n\r\nas   Chief  Minister,  but  I  am  quite  sure  fairly\r\n\r\nreasonable  summaries must have been sent to  him  - he\r\n\r\nknew the position. He knew the distinction between Mr\r\n\r\nFong  Swee  Suan's and Mr Lim Ching Siong's position.\r\n\r\nThat  Mr Fong Swee Suan was no longer a Communist  in\r\n\r\nJune  l959  but that Mr Lim Ching Siong was  still  a\r\n\r\nCommunist supporter. He knew that Mr Woodhull and Mr\r\n\r\nDevan  Nair  were not Communists. That Mr Devan  Nair\r\n\r\nhad  broken  with the Party and that Mr Woodhull  who\r\n\r\nwas  always  only fellow-travelling was finished  with\r\n\r\nthe  Communists. That was the position in  June  1959.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Cairnhill was the Chief Minister right\r\n\r\nup  to 2nd  June. How can he deny it? He knows  that\r\n\r\nthat is true. Why does he make up all this froth? When\r\n\r\nwe  appointed them - as I said before and I said it  in\r\n\r\nmy broadcasts - it was a calculated risk. We knew we had\r\n\r\nfour  on our side - Devan Nair, Woodhull, Fong Swee Suan\r\n\r\nand  James  Puthucheary - and Mr Lim  Ching  Siong  was\r\n\r\nagainst  us.  But he said openly that he  was  on  our\r\n\r\nside.  He signed the documents. Privately, we  doubted\r\n\r\nhis  sincerity. We had to take a chance to see whether\r\n\r\nthe  four could convince the one. The tragedy  of  the\r\n\r\nthing is that the one convinced the three and only one\r\n\r\nhad  enough guts to fight through - win or lose - for  his\r\n\r\nbeliefs.  I say this for the two Political Secretaries\r\n\r\nwho went through with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  they were just time-servers, they would have  gone\r\n\r\nover  to  the  other  side.

It  now\r\n\r\nhappens  that the Barisan Sosialis are going to  lose,\r\n\r\nbut  that  is another matter.

I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  submit that this is not, in actual  fact,  a\r\n\r\nregarding but rather an upgrading. The post  has  been\r\n\r\nupgraded   from   Secretary  to  Principal   Assistant\r\n\r\nSecretary.  Hence  as a result of that  upgrading,  an\r\n\r\nannual increase of $5,130 takes place, that is to say,\r\n\r\nabout $430 a month. The post of Secretary carries with\r\n\r\nit  a salary code of I-II, which is a salary scale  of\r\n\r\n$680 by stages up to a maximum of $1,420. Whereas  the\r\n\r\nsalary code for Principal Assistant Secretary is given\r\n\r\nas l-7, which carries with it a salary scale of $1,300-40A-1,420. That is to say, although the maximum of the\r\n\r\nscale  the  same, yet the difference  in  the  initial\r\n\r\nentry  is $620.

There was carried out  early\r\n\r\nthis  year  a  general  regarding  of  posts  in   the\r\n\r\nadministrative  service. This is an  exercise  carried\r\n\r\nout  after  a  detailed  study  by  officials  of  the\r\n\r\nTreasury  and  the  Organisation and  Methods  Branch.\r\n\r\nThere  was a general feeling that the former hierarchy\r\n\r\nof posts was a bit top-heavy. It was inadequate in the\r\n\r\nsense   that   certain   posts  which   carried   more\r\n\r\nresponsibility   than  others  were   not   adequately\r\n\r\nregarded  and vice versa. So a Committee of  officials\r\n\r\nof the Treasury and Organisation and Methods went into\r\n\r\nthe  details of all the posts in the Establishment and\r\n\r\nAdministrative service, and made their recommendations\r\n\r\nwhich  were  considered valid objectives and  accepted\r\n\r\nwith some amendments.

But if  you  look  at\r\n\r\nCmd.  33  of 1961, paragraph 5, on trade and  cultural\r\n\r\nrepresentation, you will see that provision  has  been\r\n\r\nmade for the Singapore State Government to incorporate\r\n\r\nits  trade representation in important places as  part\r\n\r\nof    the   Malayan   Embassy.   Whilst   the    Trade\r\n\r\nRepresentative  there will no longer  be  representing\r\n\r\nSingapore  as such and he becomes part of the  Malayan\r\n\r\ndelegation,  his duties will be just  simply  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the trade side of Singapore.

In one case, Sir,  a  man\r\n\r\nwith  a  large  family and earning only about  $120  a\r\n\r\nmonth  was  asked to pay that huge sum.  Naturally  he\r\n\r\nfelt  desperate as he wanted to respect  the  law.

Why  were  the\r\n\r\narrears  not  collected  earlier?  In  the  days  when\r\n\r\nSingapore   was  still  a  colony,  I  remember   this\r\n\r\nhappened. I went to see the Commissioner for Lands and\r\n\r\npointed out that if the arrears were not collected for\r\n\r\na  period  of  something like 20 months, then  it  was\r\n\r\npartly the fault of the Land Office for allowing these\r\n\r\narrears to accumulate.

Since  then  there  has  been  very  little\r\n\r\ntrouble  except where, for various reasons  which  are\r\n\r\nnow  under investigation, 20 houses are allowed to  be\r\n\r\nput  up in Whitley Road. The senior officer had  given\r\n\r\ninstructions  that they should be immediately  smacked\r\n\r\ndown. It was not until families had moved in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think one can minimise the problem of the\r\n\r\nhousing shortage. One sympathises. As a government, it\r\n\r\nis  our duty to provide housing. I think we are  doing\r\n\r\nour  very  best,  and we have done  better  than  ever\r\n\r\nbefore.  But I do not think we can expect to catch  up\r\n\r\nwith  the  backlog of housing for a  very  long  time,\r\n\r\nperhaps never. It is an unending process. But that  is\r\n\r\nno  excuse for allowing illegal builders to build  and\r\n\r\nbuyers to move in within a matter of hours of the last\r\n\r\nnail going in; in some cases even before the last nail\r\n\r\nis driven in. The buyer buys the house knowing that he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  buying it at a risk. And the risk is: can he  move\r\n\r\nin fast enough before the police get to know of it, or\r\n\r\nthe  land bailiff gets to know of it, and squat  there\r\n\r\nwith his wife and children, and say, \"Well, here I am.\r\n\r\nI would rather die then be moved out.\" Now that is the\r\n\r\nrisk  he  took. We have shown in Malcolm Road that  if\r\n\r\nyou  buy a house on that basis, you might lose  a  few\r\n\r\nhundred dollars. The builder takes the risk in putting\r\n\r\nit  up.  If the buyer does not move in quickly enough,\r\n\r\nthe builder has lost his money and his labour. He will\r\n\r\ntake his planks, attap and zinc away. But if he builds\r\n\r\nfast  enough before the land bailiff gets to  know  of\r\n\r\nit - it  is like a game, Sir, who beats whom in  finding\r\n\r\nout.  If  the house is completed before the police  or\r\n\r\nthe  land  bailiffs  are on the spot,  the  tenant  is\r\n\r\nalready there and he says, \"Move me if you dare,  over\r\n\r\nmy dead body.\" And we show in Malcolm Road that if you\r\n\r\nknow you carry the risk at the time you bought it  and\r\n\r\nyou  are  trying to beat the Government, so to  speak,\r\n\r\nwell  then, the law has to be enforced. And  I  cannot\r\n\r\nemphasise too strongly the fact that we intend to  see\r\n\r\nthat  these vacant spaces which are meant for schools,\r\n\r\nhospitals,  clinics - it is only a matter  of  time  and\r\n\r\nprogramming before they are built on - are built\r\n\r\non.   They are not vacant for nothing. They are vacant\r\n\r\nfor  schools, hospitals and other public institutions.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  you  allow buildings on them, the Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park can vouch from his own experience in  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T.,  you  may  never get them cleared.  There  are\r\n\r\nlarge  sections  of  open garden,  valuable  property,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  never be built on by the  Housing  Board.\r\n\r\nBecause it is so heavily and so densely built upon now\r\n\r\nby squatters that short of a fire of the dimensions of\r\n\r\nBukit Ho Swee, you will never build on it. So we would\r\n\r\nrather  face  20  unpleasant families  who  I  believe\r\n\r\npicketed the Assembly on the first day of this Session\r\n\r\nbefore they were moved away. We have just got to  face\r\n\r\nthis unpleasantness. That is all there is to it. It is\r\n\r\none  of those unfortunate things that have to be done.\r\n\r\nWhere did they live before they went there? They had a\r\n\r\nfew hundred dollars. They bought the house\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  they took the risk. That is why they moved in  so\r\n\r\nquickly;  sometimes in the very middle  of  the  night\r\n\r\nthey  moved in. By the very act of moving  in  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of  the  night or in the early  hours  of  the\r\n\r\nmorning,  they  knew  very well that  they  agreed  to\r\n\r\nsomething which they hoped the police would  not  find\r\n\r\nin  time.  And  the fact that they were successful  in\r\n\r\ninducing the land bailiff to ignore his responsibility\r\n\r\nfor  a  few hours in order to let them move in  cannot\r\n\r\nalter  the  rights and wrongs of it. We just  have  to\r\n\r\nmove in in the public interest. Schools have to go up.\r\n\r\nHospitals  have to go up. And we say,  \"Sorry.  We  do\r\n\r\nwhat we can. But you have got to get out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the arrears, it is not a question of allowing\r\n\r\nthem  to  accumulate.  When we  assumed  office  as  a\r\n\r\ngovernment,  we  found  a  certain  number  of  houses\r\n\r\nalready built on Crown land. In the two months  before\r\n\r\nwe  got down to our job, the number had increased  and\r\n\r\nwe then had to decide whether we smacked the whole lot\r\n\r\ndown or allowed the whole lot to get T.O.L.s. We spent\r\n\r\nsome  time  deliberating with Members of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. The Member for Choa Chu Kang also helped  in\r\n\r\nthe  deliberations. The decision was  made  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  all  be licensed and that they should  all  be\r\n\r\ncharged according to the size of the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin is too educated a man to take\r\n\r\nthe  line  of the others - just repeating a rumour.  By\r\n\r\nrepeating  a  rumour,  you  lend  credence  to  it.  A\r\n\r\nprincipal  of  a  secondary  school,  a  man  of  some\r\n\r\nmaturity  and standing, he comes here and says,  \"Land\r\n\r\nOffice  officials  are told that  this  is  a  Cabinet\r\n\r\ndecision  to charge so much for each house.\"  Does  he\r\n\r\nbelieve that the Cabinet of nine Ministers who have to\r\n\r\nlook after the Housing Board and the City Council, and\r\n\r\nwhat was done before by the City Council and Mayor and\r\n\r\nalso  by the Government, will spend time in allocating\r\n\r\nand  fixing  rents?  All we did was  to  say,  \"Charge\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  size  of  the  building.\"  If  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  is of a handsome size, there are  procedures\r\n\r\nand  methods  of  valuing it. From  the  size  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding, you can know the quality\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the timber and the cement on the floor and how much\r\n\r\nwas  spent on them. And the more they spent, the  more\r\n\r\nthe rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the arrears of rent. It is not because we did\r\n\r\nnot want to collect rent. What we wanted to do was  to\r\n\r\nsmack   the   building's   down,   but   for   various\r\n\r\nhumanitarian  reasons  we sanctioned  the  whole  lot.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the rents went back to six  months  - I  am\r\n\r\nspeaking  from memory now. I am sorry the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin did not give notice of the exact nature of the\r\n\r\nissue  he wanted to raise. If he had done so, I  would\r\n\r\nhave given him full particulars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  we  know that  most  of  the  land  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is put under the control of the Land  Office\r\n\r\nbecause  the Government is going to let all the  long-term leases come under the control of the Land Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the number of farmers and squatters will\r\n\r\nincrease. At present residents in squatter areas  have\r\n\r\nmany  problems  which  have  to  be  resolved  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Government must consider some ways to help\r\n\r\nthem.  Many  of the squatters who live  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas know that most of their land belong to the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice. Very often they put up a blue-print for houses\r\n\r\nwhich  they intend to build but the Land Office  would\r\n\r\ndelay  their  applications for a very long  time.  The\r\n\r\nLand Office do not investigate their applications.  As\r\n\r\na  result, many residents in the rural areas have  had\r\n\r\nto  go  to the Land Office in the City Council several\r\n\r\ntimes  to  appeal to the officers concerned to  go  to\r\n\r\ntheir  land and investigate their cases. In  the  end,\r\n\r\nthese  rural  people have had to waste much  time  and\r\n\r\nenergy  before  they can get any reply from  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice. Under these circumstances, the farmers have to\r\n\r\nwaste  much  time  and money. At the same  time,  they\r\n\r\nincur  much  inconvenience.  Therefore,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  think of some ways  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nprocedure  in  dealing with applications for  building\r\n\r\nhouses.  Only then will they be able to carry out  the\r\n\r\nbuilding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogramme as contained in their blueprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to raise is that those who\r\n\r\nstay  on  land  belonging to the Land Office  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed by the Government to make extensions to  their\r\n\r\nhouses.  In  other  words, if they have  five  members\r\n\r\noccupying the house and they now wish to apply for  an\r\n\r\nextension  to the house which they are occupying,  the\r\n\r\nLand   Office   will   usually   not   approve   their\r\n\r\napplication.  This is especially so  in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nthose  who are staying on Land belonging to  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice.  The Government must consider this point.  The\r\n\r\npopulation  is increasing all the time. This  is  only\r\n\r\nnatural.  The  members  of  a  family  will  keep   on\r\n\r\nincreasing very fast. We must not think that there are\r\n\r\nonly  five members in the family. But that was  a  few\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  Now  when  they  want  to  apply  for  an\r\n\r\nextension  to  their  house, the Government  will  not\r\n\r\napprove their application. This policy is very  wrong.\r\n\r\nThe   Government  should  not  compare   the   present\r\n\r\nsituation  with  the  past, if  any  member  of   the\r\n\r\nhousehold is going to bet married, how can the  couple\r\n\r\nstay  in  the  same house if the Government  will  not\r\n\r\napprove  their application for an extension  to  their\r\n\r\nhouse!  If  they  are to build a new house,  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice  will refuse their application. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nLand  Office  must  try  and  approve  any  reasonable\r\n\r\napplication  made  by the dwellers  if  they  wish  to\r\n\r\nextend their houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government know that most of\r\n\r\nthe people occupying land belonging to the Land Office\r\n\r\nare  poor farmers. Their livelihood depends on farming\r\n\r\nand  animal  husbandry. Unfortunately, the  Government\r\n\r\nplace strict restrictions on applications to build pig-sties and chicken sheds. I do riot say they should not\r\n\r\nmake  any application. What I am complaining about  is\r\n\r\nthat there is too much red tape. There are unnecessary\r\n\r\nprocedures  which the applicants must comply  with  in\r\n\r\norder to get their applications approved. Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nmotive  of the Government is to prevent certain clever\r\n\r\npeople from building houses on these lands and letting\r\n\r\nthem out to other people. But we must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  that  in the rural areas, houses on  such  lands\r\n\r\ncannot  be  let out to others. Moreover, the pig-sties\r\n\r\nand  chicken  sheds cannot be used by the  farmers  as\r\n\r\nhuman   habitation.  Therefore,  I   appeal   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  remove the unnecessary procedures  and\r\n\r\nred  tape in the Land Office. This will facilitate the\r\n\r\nfarmers in their application for an extension of their\r\n\r\nhouse  or  to build pig-sties and chicken sheds.  This\r\n\r\nwill  help  them  to increase their  business  and  to\r\n\r\nimprove their livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the sitting of 17th November,\r\n\r\n1961, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational Development replied to Question No. 36.* The Member for Serangoon Gardens mentioned the question of\r\n\r\nCompensation  paid by the Government to squatters  who\r\n\r\nhad  been  asked by the Government to remove.  I  have\r\n\r\nalso  received a report given to me on 11th  November,\r\n\r\nwhich was presented by the Parliamentary Secretary  to the Minister for National Development to the Clerk  of the Assembly. As far as I know, this report was handed to the Director of Land Office on 16th February, 1956. The report gives details of compensation rates payable to  squatters who are asked to remove. At the  sitting held  on  the  17th  of  November,  the  Parliamentary Secretary  replied  that  the Government  had  already\r\n\r\naltered  these compensation rates. I have  spent  much\r\n\r\ntime  in checking whether the Government has, in fact,\r\n\r\namended  these  rates.  I have  found  out  that  this\r\n\r\nrevised  table  is  just the same as  that  which  was\r\n\r\nenforced  in  1956. Therefore, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should not use or apply  the  compensation\r\n\r\nrates  which were enforceable in 1959. The  Government\r\n\r\nshould  not now tell us that they have already amended\r\n\r\nthe compensation table.

If  he\r\n\r\nis an expatriate then perhaps it is relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nsince  you have ruled that I can use only one language\r\n\r\nat  a  time  and  cannot change  to  another,  I  have\r\n\r\ntherefore  to obey you. It is a pity that  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Havelock has only one idea, i.e., if somebody says\r\n\r\nsomething  against  him,  he  will  stand  up  to  say\r\n\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has suddenly changed\r\n\r\nfrom  being a reasonable man to one who is against  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officer.  Sir,  we  want  to  solve   this\r\n\r\nproblem.  When he was a member of the Government,  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  then was not whether we had  any  suitable\r\n\r\nlocal  man  to  take  up this post.  The  question  is\r\n\r\nthis - we do not have a properly trained person to  take\r\n\r\nup  this  post. Yes, many people are very  clever  and\r\n\r\ntalented,  but the question is whether they  are  well\r\n\r\ntrained enough to take up such a post. Now, this  post\r\n\r\nof Chief Planner is not an easy one to fill. It is not\r\n\r\nany  Tom, Dick and Harry who can fill such a post.  My\r\n\r\noriginal intention was to say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  this  post of Chief Planner is a new  vote.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  is how to ensure that the beautiful  scenery\r\n\r\nin  the big city and the convenience of the public  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  could  be  looked after. The  present  Acting\r\n\r\nChief Planner is no friend of mine. So if we listen to\r\n\r\nwhat  the Member for Serangoon Gardens has said,  then\r\n\r\nwe  must give the job to him. In 1957 I went to London\r\n\r\nfor  talks with colonial officers. At that time he was\r\n\r\nstill  undergoing  training at  Liverpool  University.\r\n\r\nThat  was four years ago. Now, of course, he has  made\r\n\r\nsome progress. But this is in the interest of all  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. It is not  a  question  of  any\r\n\r\npersonal interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> On a point of order. Could the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister speak a little less because I have only\r\n\r\nthree minutes to speak. I have an amendment to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not a point of order. It is a\r\n\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> (In Mandarin): I am very sorry,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker. Sir. But I must tell the Member concerned\r\n\r\nthat  he is not like our Member for Hong Lim. Even  if\r\n\r\nhe wants to learn from him, he will not be successful.\r\n\r\nWhat we do is only in the interests of the people  and\r\n\r\nwe  can  say so publicly. Therefore, I request him  to\r\n\r\nraise questions based on facts, otherwise it will be a\r\n\r\nwaste  of time. Because he has said something, I  have\r\n\r\nto  reply,  and the time of Members in this  House  is\r\n\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nagree  with what the Prime Minister has said. We  must\r\n\r\nnot  waste time. But what we want is information which\r\n\r\nis  factual.  I  want  to know  that,  but  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is  trying to drag on from one  question  to\r\n\r\nanother.  That is a waste of time. So I hope  he  will\r\n\r\nnot indulge in such things again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nMembers  in the Opposition are trying deliberately  to\r\n\r\nwaste   time,  and  that  is  why  they  have   raised\r\n\r\nunnecessary questions. Therefore, I have to waste more\r\n\r\ntime  to  answer  them. This question  was  originally\r\n\r\nraised  by  the  Member for Serangoon Gardens.  I  now\r\n\r\nstand up to reply that the post of Chief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanner is a very important one. If we do not  have  a\r\n\r\nsuitably  trained  person available locally,  then  we\r\n\r\nmust  go abroad to get somebody to fill the post. That\r\n\r\nis  obvious. We want to have industrialisation.  Well,\r\n\r\nif  we  do  not have a suitable person,  we  may  have\r\n\r\nRussian people to come and help us. But we do not want\r\n\r\nto  have Russian people because we want to have merger\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation, so we must go to other countries\r\n\r\nto get help in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as\r\n\r\nto  what  the Prime Minister has said, is it according\r\n\r\nto   the  Standing  Orders  of  this  House  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  cannot  raise  question?  When  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   says   that  we  have  raised   unnecessary\r\n\r\nquestions, does he mean that we have no right  to  ask\r\n\r\nquestions of the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is the Speaker who will decide\r\n\r\nwhether  the  question is relevant  or  irrelevant.
