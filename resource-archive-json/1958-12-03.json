As I informed  the\r\n\r\nHouse  on  5th November, the aim of the Government  in\r\n\r\nmaking  these changes is solely to improve the balance\r\n\r\nand   content   of   the  present  Chinese   broadcast\r\n\r\nprogrammes   and  advice  was  sought   from   several\r\n\r\nrepresentative  bodies  and  individuals  before   the\r\n\r\ndecision was taken in agreement with the Government of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya. Nevertheless, I welcome the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  giving  more  details  of   what   is\r\n\r\nproposed,  since  I think it will  be  seen  that  the\r\n\r\napprehensions  underlying  these  representations  are\r\n\r\nlargely without foundation. No changes will be made in\r\n\r\nthe   cultural   contributions  made   by   the   four\r\n\r\ncommunities in question to the Chinese broadcasts. The\r\n\r\nopera, music and songs will continue as before and, in\r\n\r\nparticular, the Teochew story-teller and those of  the\r\n\r\nother  dialects will remain on the air. The only major\r\n\r\npractical  change will be to cut out the regular  news\r\n\r\nbulletins  in these dialects. The present practice  of\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  the  news bulletins in  seven  different\r\n\r\ndialects  means that, out of a total weekly  programme\r\n\r\nof  83\u00bd  hours, no less than 10\u00bd hours is consumed\r\n\r\nin  the repetition of news bulletins. Moreover,  since\r\n\r\nthese have to be broadcast at fixed times of the  day,\r\n\r\nit    leaves   little   flexibility   for   periodical\r\n\r\nadjustments   and   improvements   in   the   cultural\r\n\r\nprogrammes. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  add  that in times of emergency,  arrangements\r\n\r\nwould always be made for important announcements to be\r\n\r\ngiven in as many dialects as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I should mention two other improvements\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is  proposed to make from 1st January.  All\r\n\r\nChinese programmes will from that date be broadcast on\r\n\r\na single frequency. This will save listeners having to\r\n\r\nretune  their sets in the course of listening  to  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes.

In the Jalan Sultan area where  20,288  residents were X-rayed, the percentage of persons\r\n\r\nshowing  evidence  of  tuberculosis  both  healed  and\r\n\r\nactive was 13.2.

The  percentage\r\n\r\nof those found to be suffering in the area from active\r\n\r\ntuberculosis  is estimated to be 3.5. The  reason  for\r\n\r\nthis estimate is this. From the Jalan Sultan area, 662\r\n\r\npersons   are  now  under  treatment.  That  gives   a\r\n\r\npercentage  of  3.26, but of the 13.2, that  is  2,675\r\n\r\npersons,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncalled for assessment, 219 have not yet turned up.

If, however, the reports in the newspapers\r\n\r\nof  suspension of exports of certain preserves, salted\r\n\r\nvegetables  and  fruits are correct, it  could  create\r\n\r\nsome difficulty in supplies for those who prefer these\r\n\r\narticles;  but it is unlikely to have any  significant\r\n\r\neffect  on  the  cost of living as a whole.  It  might\r\n\r\nperhaps   be   beneficial  by  switching   the   taste\r\n\r\npreference  of  consumers to similar locally  produced\r\n\r\narticles.  It is also unlikely to have any significant\r\n\r\neffect on our entrepot trade, as indications show that\r\n\r\nnot much of the above goods go into the entrepot trade\r\n\r\nstream and also because most of the goods required for\r\n\r\nour  entrepot  trade are freely available  from  other\r\n\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the picture of China's trade as a whole\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore, we have been exporting to China  much\r\n\r\nless than we have been importing from China.

Jumabhoy:</b> I must take this opportunity of\r\n\r\ncorrecting some mis-impressions that might  have  been\r\n\r\ncreated  in  the minds of the people of  Singapore  by\r\n\r\ncertain  statements  alleged  to  have  been  made  by\r\n\r\ntrading agencies in China in their correspondence with\r\n\r\nSingapore merchants, as quoted in Press reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been alleged that the reported suspension by\r\n\r\nChina   in  certain  lines  of  exports  to  Singapore\r\n\r\nresulted  from certain discriminatory actions  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government. The only  action  by  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  could be construed as such was the ban  imposed\r\n\r\nlast month at the request of the Federation Government\r\n\r\non imports of certain types of textiles. The first and\r\n\r\nforemost duty of any elected Government in any country\r\n\r\nis  to safeguard the economy of the country. As far as\r\n\r\nSingapore  is concerned, the economy of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthat  of the Federation is so closely interlinked that\r\n\r\nany  damage to the economy of the Federation is  bound\r\n\r\nto have a much stronger repercussion in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are looking to a merger with the Federation, it\r\n\r\nis  the clear duty of any Singapore Government  to  do\r\n\r\nits  best  to  prevent the undermining of the  Malayan\r\n\r\neconomy. The step taken by the Singapore Government at\r\n\r\nthe   request   of   the  Federation   Government   to\r\n\r\ntemporarily  safeguard their textile industry  is  not\r\n\r\ntherefore a discriminatory step against China as such;\r\n\r\nbut  a  step  taken  for the benefit  of  the  Malayan\r\n\r\neconomy  as a whole. I can well conceive such  a  step\r\n\r\nbeing  taken  against  any other  country  if  it  was\r\n\r\nconsidered necessary in the interests of our  economy,\r\n\r\nbearing  of  course in mind any officially  recognized\r\n\r\ncontractual obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might bear a little explaining why the step was\r\n\r\ntaken  against  the particular types of textiles  only\r\n\r\nfrom  China.  It  is quite apparent that  the  trading\r\n\r\npolicy  of  China is strongly influenced by  political\r\n\r\nconsiderations,  as is evidenced from  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nChina has been selling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  goods below the comparative producing  cost  of\r\n\r\ncountries like Japan, where there is a high degree  of\r\n\r\nautomation  and  labour is cheap. In fact,  China  has\r\n\r\nbeen  able to underprice her goods even below the cost\r\n\r\nof  Hongkong  producers who have had at their  command\r\n\r\ncheap refugee labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent, therefore, that China's policy has\r\n\r\nbeen  to dump its goods in certain markets at a  price\r\n\r\nwhich  has  no  bearing on the cost of  production  in\r\n\r\norder   to   undermine  the  industries   of   certain\r\n\r\ncountries.  This undercutting cannot, however,  go  on\r\n\r\nindefinitely  without  having  an  effect  on  China's\r\n\r\neconomy, and it is possible that the present move  may\r\n\r\nbe   due  to  the  adverse  economic  results  of  the\r\n\r\nundercutting policies being felt in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also possible that long-term credit\r\n\r\narrangements may have been stretched too far and  that\r\n\r\nChina  may be feeling that the time has come  to  stop\r\n\r\nthese credit facilities and ask for cash payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Nonsense!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Of course,  the\r\n\r\npublic  reaction to both leakages - especially when  the\r\n\r\nsecond  one followed the first one so closely - is  that\r\n\r\nmy  head and the heads of my Ministry officials should\r\n\r\nbe  delivered on a charger to this House, in  addition\r\n\r\nto a public enquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the concern of the people over these\r\n\r\nleakages   because  these  examinations  are  national\r\n\r\nexaminations.  But,  when  serious  things  like  this\r\n\r\nhappen,  we  must  keep calm and refrain  from  saying\r\n\r\nanything  that  might prejudice the issue  before  the\r\n\r\ntruth is out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The English Secondary Schools' Entrance Examination\r\n\r\nis  a  stepping stone to secondary education which  is\r\n\r\nmuch  sought  after,  and  for  which  there  may   be\r\n\r\ninsufficient  places  for  those  who  want  it.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment Chinese Senior Middle III examination is  a\r\n\r\nnational  examination enabling those who  pass  it  to\r\n\r\nobtain employment in the public service and to go  for\r\n\r\nhigher  studies. Those who are responsible  for  these\r\n\r\nleakages,  either  through negligence  or  dishonesty,\r\n\r\nwill  be  punished  and their identities  exposed  for\r\n\r\npublic disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement that I am making today, and any future\r\n\r\nstatements that I will make on this subject,  will  be\r\n\r\nmade   without   fear  or  favour.  Those   who   have\r\n\r\ndishonestly  caused the leakage or  dishonestly  taken\r\n\r\nadvantage of the leakage are a disgrace to the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  By their action, they have  undermined\r\n\r\nour educational system and the morals of our students.\r\n\r\nThese people stand publicly condemned before the House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if only our public-spirited citizens will give\r\n\r\nus   information  of  the  type  we  received  on  3rd\r\n\r\nNovember, 1958, then every crime in Singapore will  be\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily  solved.  At  4.30  p.m. on   3rd   of\r\n\r\nNovember,  my Permanent Secretary received information\r\n\r\nthat   examination  questions  set  in   the   English\r\n\r\nSecondary    Schools'   Entrance   Examination    were\r\n\r\nobtainable  at No. 141 Carpmael Road. The Police  were\r\n\r\ninformed immediately and by 8.30 p.m. a copy  of  some\r\n\r\nof the questions had already been obtained by a Police\r\n\r\nofficer  from  someone  living  in  that  house.   The\r\n\r\nquestions obtained were found to be identical  to  the\r\n\r\nquestions  set  in  the paper for the  next  day.  The\r\n\r\nPolice officer paid a second visit to the house on the\r\n\r\nfollowing  evening and obtained further questions  for\r\n\r\nthe  next day. At ten minutes past ten that night, 141\r\n\r\nCarpmael  Road  was  searched by the  Police  under  a\r\n\r\nsearch  warrant  issued  by a  Magistrate,  and  other\r\n\r\ncopies  of  the questions were found, but no  original\r\n\r\nprinted copies. From there the Police commenced  their\r\n\r\ninvestigations and in a few days the Police had traced\r\n\r\nthe  source  of the leakage and brought to book  eight\r\n\r\npersons.  There was no doubt where the source  of  the\r\n\r\nleakage  was.  Swift and firm action  is  being  taken\r\n\r\nagainst the persons concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee of the Government Printing Office and\r\n\r\nthree   clerks   of  another  department   have   been\r\n\r\ninterdicted. Action has been taken under the Education\r\n\r\nOrdinance  against the three teachers concerned - one  a\r\n\r\nre-employed  retired teacher in a  Government  English\r\n\r\nSchool,  and  the  other  two teachers  in  a  private\r\n\r\nschool. They have been struck\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noff  the  register as teachers. The allegation against\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council employee has been referred  to  the\r\n\r\nCity Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the leakage in the Government Senior\r\n\r\nMiddle  III  examination,  investigations  are   still\r\n\r\nproceeding and I do not propose, for obvious  reasons,\r\n\r\nto  disclose  progress at this stage.  I  would  like,\r\n\r\nhowever, to appeal to everyone who has information  to\r\n\r\nassist  my  Ministry and help us in eradicating  these\r\n\r\npeople and in punishing all those who were responsible\r\n\r\nfor  this leakage. At the risk of repetition, I  might\r\n\r\nagain add that this is a national examination and must\r\n\r\nbe   absolutely  reliable.  Possession   of   a   pass\r\n\r\nCertificate  will  entitle the  holder  to  enter  the\r\n\r\npublic services and I am, therefore, determined to see\r\n\r\nthat  the  fair name of Chinese education is kept  up.\r\n\r\nAnd  for this reason, I am equally determined to  deal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the culprits ruthlessly.

Members very shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1958 has not been a particularly easy year. When the\r\n\r\nDraft Estimates were introduced in December, 1957,  it\r\n\r\nwas  said that, although a deficit was budgetted  for,\r\n\r\nit  was  probable  that revenue and expenditure  would\r\n\r\nbalance   in   the  event,  provided   that   economic\r\n\r\nconditions   continued  favourable  and  supplementary\r\n\r\nvotes  were  reduced to a minimum. Almost immediately,\r\n\r\nthe  recession  in trade, which had been  threatening,\r\n\r\nstruck in the United States. By the early spring,  its\r\n\r\neffects  were  beginning to be felt in  Singapore.  By\r\n\r\nMay,  there was no doubt that it had arrived.  Revenue\r\n\r\ncollections  began to fall below the  estimate.  Money\r\n\r\nbecame  tighter. Trade drifted into the  doldrums.  It\r\n\r\nwas  impossible to say how severe the recession  would\r\n\r\nbe,  or how long it would last. We were fairly heavily\r\n\r\ncommitted  as  far  as expenditure  was  concerned.  A\r\n\r\nsevere  and prolonged recession could have  a  serious\r\n\r\neffect on our finances. We were more vulnerable to the\r\n\r\neffects of a trade recession than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  had  ever  been before because we  now  relied  on\r\n\r\ncompany and income tax for 26 per cent of our revenue.\r\n\r\nIf the recession were severe or prolonged, we would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin danger of incurring substantial deficits on current\r\n\r\naccount which would in turn run down reserves. It  was\r\n\r\nalready clear that we had started off the year with  a\r\n\r\nmuch  smaller balance in the Development Fund than  we\r\n\r\nhad  expected, and there was certain to be  a  deficit\r\n\r\nwhich would have to be met from reserves. A severe and\r\n\r\nprolonged  recession would also limit our  ability  to\r\n\r\nraise   loans  and  to  contribute  from  revenue   to\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  We might be in some danger  of  entering\r\n\r\ninto  capital  commitments  which  we  might  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult to meet. In short, the cumulative effect  of\r\n\r\na severe and prolonged trade recession would be to run\r\n\r\ndown  our  basic reserves below the safety  level.  It\r\n\r\ntherefore  seemed  essential  to  take  stock  of  the\r\n\r\nposition  and to introduce such precautionary measures\r\n\r\nas seemed necessary while there was still time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  are already aware of the  steps  which\r\n\r\nwere  taken in this connection. As far as the ordinary\r\n\r\nestimates  of expenditure were concerned,  all  vacant\r\n\r\nposts  were  \"frozen\" until they could be reviewed  in\r\n\r\nthe light of the changed financial position. Heads  of\r\n\r\nDepartments   were  asked  to  review  all   recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure in order to effect the maximum  economies.\r\n\r\nItems  of  special expenditure not yet committed  were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexamined  and  many  which  were  not  essential  were\r\n\r\nruthlessly   cut  out.  As  far  as  the   Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  were concerned, a halt was  called  on  all\r\n\r\nprojects  which had not yet been started, in order  to\r\n\r\navoid any danger of becoming over-committed. Advantage\r\n\r\nwas also taken of the halt to re-examine the immediate\r\n\r\nneed  for some items of capital development which  had\r\n\r\nhitherto been given a high priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps which were taken have achieved the purpose.\r\n\r\nAs   far   as   ordinary  expenditure  is   concerned,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsiderable   economies   have   been   effected   in\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  personal emoluments  over  and  above\r\n\r\nthose which were to be expected,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand my latest information is that expenditure will  be\r\n\r\nabout $104 million compared with the original estimate\r\n\r\nof  $123 million. Economies have also been effected on\r\n\r\nAnnually Recurrent expenditure and it now looks as  if\r\n\r\nexpenditure will not exceed $106 million compared with\r\n\r\nthe  original estimate of $111 million and the revised\r\n\r\nestimate of $108 million given in the Memorandum which\r\n\r\naccompanied the estimates. Special expenditure is  now\r\n\r\nestimated  at  about  $38 million  compared  with  the\r\n\r\nestimate of $42 million. In all, total expenditure now\r\n\r\nseems likely to be of the order of $248 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, revenue has not suffered as\r\n\r\nseriously  as  it  was  at one  time  thought  likely.\r\n\r\nCollections  of  customs duties have certainly  fallen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelow the estimate, particularly in respect of liquors\r\n\r\nand  petrol, but it appears probable that  Income  Tax\r\n\r\ncollections will achieve the estimate. Fortunately,  a\r\n\r\ntotal  shortfall of close on $5 million under Class  I\r\n\r\nis  likely  to  be  offset by corresponding  increases\r\n\r\nunder  Classes  IV and V and the total should  not  be\r\n\r\nvery  far  off the original estimate of $249  million.\r\n\r\nWith   some   luck,  therefore,  actual  revenue   and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpenditure might balance at about $248 million which,\r\n\r\nwhen all things are considered, is very satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as development was concerned, the steps taken\r\n\r\nwere  equally effective. Expenditure was brought under\r\n\r\ncontrol and any possibility of becoming over-committed\r\n\r\nwas  avoided. A number of large items were re-examined\r\n\r\nand  awarded a lower priority than had previously been\r\n\r\nattached to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of the latest information available, it\r\n\r\nseems likely that development expenditure in 1958 will\r\n\r\nbe  of the order of $62 million which is approximately\r\n\r\nthe  same  as the total of development expenditure  in\r\n\r\n1957.  The  largest item of expenditure  is  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  housing  which  accounts  for  $21\r\n\r\nmillion  compared with $8 million in 1955, $9  million\r\n\r\nin 1956, and $18 million in 1957. The final instalment\r\n\r\nof the loan to the Singapore Telephone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard amounts to $5 million. Works and buildings  have\r\n\r\ncost $21.4 million and the balance has been devoted to\r\n\r\nSpecial   Development  Expenditure.   To   meet   this\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  the  resources of the  Development  Fund\r\n\r\nhave  totalled  $49 million. In this  connection,  the\r\n\r\nbalance of the Development Fund carried over from 1957\r\n\r\nwas  over-estimated by $16 million. This was due to  a\r\n\r\nrapid  and unforeseen increase in expenditure  between\r\n\r\nthe  time when the estimates were drawn up and the end\r\n\r\nof the year. There is therefore likely to be a deficit\r\n\r\nof  the  order of $13 million in the Development  Fund\r\n\r\nwhich will have to be charged to reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year should therefore end with revenue and\r\n\r\nexpenditure balanced, with a deficit of $13 million in\r\n\r\nthe Development Fund, and a charge of about $4 million\r\n\r\nin  respect  of Malayanisation Compensation,  both  of\r\n\r\nwhich  will  have to be met from reserve. The  general\r\n\r\nrevenue balance, which stood at $78 million at the end\r\n\r\nof  1957,  will stand at about $83 million  after  $20\r\n\r\nmillion has been added in respect of Christmas. Island\r\n\r\nand allowance made for appreciation of investments  on\r\n\r\nthe one hand and deduction made for the deficit in the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund and in respect of Malayanisation  on\r\n\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally comforting is the fact that the recession now\r\n\r\nappears  to be definitely on the wane. It seems  clear\r\n\r\nthat  the tide had already turned in the United States\r\n\r\nby  the  time the worst effects of the recession  were\r\n\r\nbeginning to be felt in Singapore. It is also true  to\r\n\r\nsay that the recession has been \"cushioned\" as far  as\r\n\r\nSingapore is concerned by the fact that the volume  of\r\n\r\nrubber   handled,  and  its  price,  have  been   well\r\n\r\nmaintained throughout the year, and by the  fact  that\r\n\r\ntrade  with  Indonesia has remained good.  There  are,\r\n\r\nhowever,  still one or two disquieting  features.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the present state of the tin industry  gives\r\n\r\nmuch cause for concern, although it is hoped that this\r\n\r\nmay  pick up in the second quarter of 1959. But on the\r\n\r\nwhole  it  looks as if the tide has definitely  turned\r\n\r\nhere  also  and  there is a reasonable hope  that  the\r\n\r\nrecession may be a thing of the past by the middle  of\r\n\r\nnext year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us turn now to the Draft Estimates of Revenue and\r\n\r\nExpenditure  for 1959. Revenue has been estimated,  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  existing taxation, at $243.6  million.\r\n\r\nCollections  under  Class I have, in  the  main,  been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestimated  on  the  basis  of  collections  in   1958.\r\n\r\nAllowance  has  been  made for a  slight  increase  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollections of entertainment duty due t, the fact that\r\n\r\nsome new cinemas will be in operation in 1959. It  has\r\n\r\nbeen estimated that liquor duties will yield much  the\r\n\r\nsame  in  1958.  The consumption of  petrol  tends  to\r\n\r\nincrease  but  at a slower rate than in the  immediate\r\n\r\npast and allowance has been made for a slight increase\r\n\r\nin collections. The estimate for collections of income\r\n\r\ntax  shows a decrease of $10 million compared with the\r\n\r\nestimate  of  collections for 1958,  allowance  having\r\n\r\nbeen  made  for  the  reduction of  earnings  of  some\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  the  last  twelve  months.  The   total\r\n\r\nestimate  for the Class is $185 million compared  with\r\n\r\nan  original estimate of $196.8 million and a  revised\r\n\r\nestimate of $191.8 million for 1958. The estimate  for\r\n\r\nClass  II  at  $17.5 million shows an increase  of  $2\r\n\r\nmillion  compared with the revised estimate for  1958.\r\n\r\nallowance  having  been made for the  increased  yield\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Education  Rate recently  approved  by  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. It is estimated that collections under Class\r\n\r\nIII   will  be  maintained  at  about  the  level   of\r\n\r\ncollections in 1958. The estimate for Class IV shows a\r\n\r\nreduction of $2.2 million compared with 1958 due to  a\r\n\r\nreduction  in the estimate for interest on investments\r\n\r\nand  loans.  This  however is  counterbalanced  by  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  $2.4  million under Class  V,  it  being\r\n\r\nexpected  that  profits from the  currency  fund  will\r\n\r\nexceed the share received in 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates of expenditure for 1959 total $268.5\r\n\r\nmillion  compared with $277 million in 1958.  If  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers will look at the table which appears on page 5\r\n\r\nof  the  Memorandum which accompanied  the  Estimates,\r\n\r\nthey  will  see that the estimate of expenditure  each\r\n\r\nyear  has  tended to exceed, sometimes by considerable\r\n\r\namounts, the estimate for the previous years. I  think\r\n\r\nthat it will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe agreed that it is a considerable achievement on the\r\n\r\npart  of  all officers responsible for the preparation\r\n\r\nof  departmental estimates to have managed to keep the\r\n\r\nestimate  for  1959 not only within, but  considerably\r\n\r\nbelow,  that for 1958. It has been achieved by a  most\r\n\r\nmeticulous  examination  of  all  proposals;  by  more\r\n\r\nrealistic   estimating  of  expenditure  on   personal\r\n\r\nemoluments   in  the  case  of  the  larger   spending\r\n\r\ndepartments:  by insisting that, as far  as  possible,\r\n\r\nall  existing  vacancies should be filled  before  new\r\n\r\nposts  are created; by measuring demands for new posts\r\n\r\nand  additional recurrent expenditure against services\r\n\r\nwhich  will  actually  come into  being  in  1959;  by\r\n\r\nkeeping  to a minimum the number of recruits necessary\r\n\r\nto  maintain  the pipe line in Education;  by  cutting\r\n\r\nprovision  for recurrent expenditure to the bone;  and\r\n\r\nby   being  quite  ruthless  about  items  of  special\r\n\r\nexpenditure  which were not absolutely  imperative.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  sure  that  hon.  Members will  find  cause  for\r\n\r\nconsiderable  satisfaction in the results  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen achieved by these measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time I must make it clear that, while it\r\n\r\nhas  been possible to keep the estimate of expenditure\r\n\r\nwell  within the limits of the 1958 provision, it must\r\n\r\nnot be expected that actual expenditure can be limited\r\n\r\nin  the  same  way.  An  increase  in  expenditure  is\r\n\r\ninevitable.  A  glance at the table which  appears  on\r\n\r\npage  13  of the Estimates will show how it  tends  to\r\n\r\nincrease,  department  by department,  each  year.  An\r\n\r\nincrease  over 1958 levels must be expected  in  1959.\r\n\r\nIncrements  under  approved  schemes  must  be   paid;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvacancies in essential posts must be filled;  recruits\r\n\r\nhitherto   lacking   will  almost   certainly   become\r\n\r\navailable;  and there is of course the ever increasing\r\n\r\nrecurrent expenditure on Education arising out of  the\r\n\r\npolicy  approved by the All Party Committee  in  1955.\r\n\r\nBut the action taken in connection with the 1959 Draft\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimates  will  mean  that the rate  of  increase  is\r\n\r\nslowed  down, and the great point, of course, is  that\r\n\r\nthe  ceiling or limit of possible expenditure has been\r\n\r\nlowered very considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the format of the estimates is concerned,\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  only one major change,  namely,  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  a  separate Head for District  Councils.\r\n\r\nAnother  change  is  the disappearance  of  the  Royal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalayan  Navy,  it  having  been  transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. As far as content is concerned,\r\n\r\nthere is little which is novel or new or likely to  be\r\n\r\ncontentious in the Draft Estimates. The only points of\r\n\r\nthis nature to which attention might be drawn are  the\r\n\r\ncreation of a Guard and Escort Unit absorbing the bulk\r\n\r\nof the Special Constabulary under Police, the creation\r\n\r\nof  a  section  for  Community  Recreation  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour  and  provision  in  respect   of\r\n\r\nbudgetary   deficits  and  scholarships  for   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimate of expenditure on personal emoluments\r\n\r\ntotals  $114.9 million compared with $123  million  in\r\n\r\n1958.  The action taken to achieve this reduction  has\r\n\r\nalready been described. New posts have been limited to\r\n\r\nthe  absolute minimum required to maintain  efficiency\r\n\r\nand  to provide for new and expanding services. A list\r\n\r\nof  the  new  posts entered for 1959 is given  in  the\r\n\r\nappendix to the Memorandum which accompanied the Draft\r\n\r\nEstimates.  The total of 885 compares  with  1,584  in\r\n\r\n1956, 1,727 in 1957 and 1,723 in 1958. The list  does\r\n\r\nnot  include  the  posts required for  the  Guard  and\r\n\r\nEscort  Unit, since the creation of this  Unit  merely\r\n\r\ninvolves a switch of posts from Special Expenditure to\r\n\r\nPersonal Emoluments. The bulk of the new posts  appear\r\n\r\nunder  Police, where the Special Branch and the C.  I.\r\n\r\nD, have  been  strengthened; under  Education,  where\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision  has  been  made to  maintain  a  supply  of\r\n\r\nrecruits for the training pipe line; and under Medical\r\n\r\nwhere  provision  has  been  made  for  recruits   for\r\n\r\ntraining  in various branches and for the staffing  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chronic Sick Hospital. As I have said, everything\r\n\r\npossible  has been done to estimate realistically  the\r\n\r\nsum   required  for  emoluments  in  1959.   In   this\r\n\r\nconnection, it will be noted that, in the case of some\r\n\r\ndepartments - Education  and  Medical  in   particular - a\r\n\r\nspecial reduction has been made to take account of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhidden under-expenditure. The total provision is  $114\r\n\r\nmillion  and  I  do not think that actual  expenditure\r\n\r\nwill fall very far short of this amount. There will no\r\n\r\nlonger be the savings under Personal Emoluments  which\r\n\r\nhave been a marked characteristic of previous years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimate of expenditure under O.C.A.R. is $118\r\n\r\nmillion compared with $111 million in 1958. Everything\r\n\r\npossible  has been done to perpetuate the  substantial\r\n\r\neconomies effected in 1958 but these have been  offset\r\n\r\nby  the  expansion of the Social Services and  by  the\r\n\r\nincreased  provision required for  District  Councils,\r\n\r\nPublic  Debt  and  Pensions.  For  example,  Education\r\n\r\nrequires a net increase of $4.6 million. The provision\r\n\r\nfor  Grants  in  aid  has risen  by  $2  million.  The\r\n\r\nPolytechnic, which will be in full operation in  1959,\r\n\r\nwill  require  $1.7 million. The contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya, which has been transferred  from\r\n\r\nO.  C.  S.  E.,  will  amount to $2.676  million.  The\r\n\r\nMedical  and Health Department requires $10.9  million\r\n\r\ncompared with $9.7 million in 1958. Provision for  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Debt  has  been increased by $1.1  million  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for charges in respect of the new loan  which\r\n\r\nit  is  hoped  to float in 1959. Pensions  require  an\r\n\r\nadditional  $1.5  million. As far  as  expenditure  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, actual O.C.A.R. expenditure always tends to\r\n\r\napproximate  to  the estimate and it is  doubtful  if\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in 1959 will fall very far short  of  the\r\n\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum provided for Special Expenditure is $35.3\r\n\r\nmillion  of  which  $20 million is a  contribution  to\r\n\r\ndevelopment. The main items of expenditure  have  been\r\n\r\nindicated  in  the  Memorandum which  accompanied  the\r\n\r\nDraft  Estimates. As will be seen from an  examination\r\n\r\nof   the  Draft  Estimates,  the  Special  Expenditure\r\n\r\nestimates have been drastically pruned. Taking  under-expenditure on the one hand and unforeseen revotes  on\r\n\r\nthe  other into account, it is considered that  actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in  1959  will be of  the  order  of  $33\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, if I may be allowed to hazard a guess as\r\n\r\nto  what  actual  expenditure on the  basis  of  these\r\n\r\nestimates is likely to be in 1959, I should  say  that\r\n\r\nit will be of the order of $264 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position therefore is that, for 1959, we have\r\n\r\nrevenue   estimated   at  $243  million,   expenditure\r\n\r\nestimated  at $264 million and a deficit  of  possibly\r\n\r\n$21 million to be bridged by increased taxation. It is\r\n\r\nproposed to bridge this gap by raising company tax and\r\n\r\nthe  rate of tax on non-resident individuals to 40 per\r\n\r\ncent; to increase the rate of individual income tax on\r\n\r\nall  chargeable  incomes of over  $4,000  with  a  new\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  50  per  cent on  chargeable  incomes  of\r\n\r\n$50,000  and over; and to make certain adjustments  to\r\n\r\nthe  tobacco duty tariff. It is estimated  that  these\r\n\r\nmeasures will yield about $21 million in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to company tax, it has been considered\r\n\r\nfor  some  time  that  an increase  in  the  rate  was\r\n\r\njustified  but  circumstances have prevented  us  from\r\n\r\ntaking  action.  It  has  now  been  agreed  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government that the rate of tax  should  be\r\n\r\nincreased  to 40 per cent and the Minister of  Finance\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation is making an announcement to  this\r\n\r\neffect today. This new rate will be effective from the\r\n\r\n1st  of January. At the same time, it has been decided\r\n\r\nto   increase   the   rate  of  tax  on   non-resident\r\n\r\nindividuals, trustees and executors to the same level.\r\n\r\nIn the past, it has been found desirable that the rate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  tax on companies and non-resident individuals etc.\r\n\r\nshould be the same. A bill amending section 43 of  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax Ordinance in these respects will be tabled\r\n\r\ntoday. It is estimated that these measures will  yield\r\n\r\n$10 million in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been decided to raise the rate of tax on\r\n\r\nindividual incomes on all chargeable incomes of $4,000\r\n\r\nand  over, rising to a new maximum of 50 per  cent  on\r\n\r\nincomes  of  $50,000 and over. A motion to  amend  the\r\n\r\nSecond Schedule of the Income Tax Ordinance will be in\r\n\r\nthe  hands of hon. Members this morning. The new  rate\r\n\r\nof  tax is shown in the Schedule which is attached  to\r\n\r\nthe motion. A comparison of this new schedule with the\r\n\r\nexisting Second Schedule will indicate the changes  in\r\n\r\nrate.  Chargeable  incomes of  under  $4,000  are  not\r\n\r\naffected   by  the  change.  An  individual   with   a\r\n\r\nchargeable income of $5,000 will have to pay $40 more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  he  does  at  present. A man with  a  chargeable\r\n\r\nincome  of  $7,000 will have to pay $60 more  than  he\r\n\r\ndoes  at  present; a man with a chargeable  income  of\r\n\r\n$15,000,  $300 more; a man with chargeable  income  of\r\n\r\n$25,000, $800 more an so on. The new maximum is 50 per\r\n\r\ncent  which  is  attached  to  chargeable  incomes  of\r\n\r\n$50,000 and over. At this level, the increase  in  tax\r\n\r\nwill  be $3,800. A table showing the increases in  tax\r\n\r\nat  various levels of chargeable income is attached to\r\n\r\nthe  motion which will be in the hands of hon. Members\r\n\r\ntoday. The Federation Government cannot see its way to\r\n\r\ntake  similar action at the present time.  However,  I\r\n\r\ncan  say  that  the  Federation  Government  sees   no\r\n\r\nobjection,  from  the  point of  view  of  Pan-Malayan\r\n\r\nincome tax, to Singapore taking independent action  at\r\n\r\nthe present time. The fact that different rates of tax\r\n\r\non  individual  incomes  are being  used  in  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories   will   not  cause   any   administrative\r\n\r\ninconvenience  or  difficulty. It  is  estimated  that\r\n\r\nthese  new  rates  which will be  effective  from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1959 will yield rather more than $5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been decided to alter the tobacco duty\r\n\r\ntariff.  The system of charging an ad valorem duty  on\r\n\r\nthe  c.i.f. price of certain brands of cigarettes  and\r\n\r\npipe  tobacco which was introduced in October has  not\r\n\r\nworked  particularly well in practice.  It  has  given\r\n\r\nrise  to  certain  anomalies and the  yield  has  been\r\n\r\ndisappointingly low. It has therefore been decided  to\r\n\r\nrevert  to the old system whereby duty was charged  on\r\n\r\nweight  alone, and to increase the duty on most brands\r\n\r\nof  imported cigarettes and pipe tobacco to the levels\r\n\r\nwhich  have been maintained in the Federation for  the\r\n\r\npast  five  years.  In revising the duty  on  imported\r\n\r\ncigarettes,  a  distinction  has  been  made   between\r\n\r\ncigarettes  with a tobacco content of less  than  2.32\r\n\r\nlbs, per thousand sticks and cigarettes with a tobacco\r\n\r\ncontent  of 2.32 lbs, a thousand sticks or more,  that\r\n\r\nis,  between  cigarettes like Double Ace, Rough  Rider\r\n\r\nand  Torchlight, and all other brands. The duty on the\r\n\r\nformer will remain at the present levels of $8.60 a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npound  full and $8.10 a pound preferential  while  the\r\n\r\nduty  on  the  latter  will be  raised  to  Federation\r\n\r\nlevels,  namely $10.50 a pound full and  $10  a  pound\r\n\r\npreferential. This will mean that while  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nthe  poor man's smokes remains unchanged, the cost  of\r\n\r\nthe more expensive brands will go up by 5 cents for  a\r\n\r\npacket   of  10  cigarettes.  The  price  of   locally\r\n\r\nmanufactured cigarettes will also remain unchanged  as\r\n\r\nit  is  not proposed to raise the rate of duty on  cut\r\n\r\ntobacco imported for local manufacture of machine-made\r\n\r\ncigarettes  for the present at any rate. The  duty  on\r\n\r\nall  brands  of  pipe  tobacco will  be  increased  to\r\n\r\nFederation levels, that is $10.10 a pound full and $10\r\n\r\na  pound  preferential. These changes in  the  tobacco\r\n\r\ntariff  took  effect at midnight last night  and  have\r\n\r\nsince been gazetted. A motion under section 11 of  the\r\n\r\nCustoms  Ordinance  will be debated  on  the  12th  of\r\n\r\nDecember. The changes should yield about $5.5  million\r\n\r\nin 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These increases should yield a total of about $21\r\n\r\nmillion  and should bring the total revenue collection\r\n\r\nup  to $264 million. This approximates to the estimate\r\n\r\nof  actual  expenditure which I have given  and  which\r\n\r\ncomes   within  $4  million  of  the  total  estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  $268 million which is  shown  in  the\r\n\r\nDraft  Estimates.  In short, we have  come  within  $4\r\n\r\nmillion of balancing the budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates are shown on pages 431 to\r\n\r\n459 in the volume of Draft Estimates. It will be noted\r\n\r\nthat,  in framing the Development Estimates, provision\r\n\r\nhas  only  been made for the completion of work  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  in hand at the end of this year, for  a  few\r\n\r\nservices  of a recurring nature, for one  or  two  new\r\n\r\nprojects  which  are regarded of such importance  that\r\n\r\nthey  must  go  on, and for an entirely  new  project,\r\n\r\nunemployment  relief works. Estimated  expenditure  on\r\n\r\nthese  services amounts to $42 million and it will  be\r\n\r\nfinanced  by  a  contribution  of  $20  million   from\r\n\r\nrevenue, by the repayment instalments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof long term loans due in 1959, by  a  small\r\n\r\ncontribution  from C.D.W. fund for the  completion  of\r\n\r\nschemes  in progress, and by further appropriation  of\r\n\r\n$18.5 million from surplus funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons which have persuaded the Government to\r\n\r\nprepare  development estimates of  this  comparatively\r\n\r\nlimited scope are three-fold. In the first place,  the\r\n\r\nDraft Estimates as now drawn up represent the limit of\r\n\r\nwhat  can  be  financed with safety and  certainty  in\r\n\r\n1959.  In the second place, from now on we shall  have\r\n\r\nto  rely  to  a  great  extent  on  loans  to  finance\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  it  is impossible  to  say  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture  with  any degree of certainty - certainly  not\r\n\r\nthat  degree of certainty which would justify entering\r\n\r\ninto specific expenditure commitments - when we shall be\r\n\r\nable to float a loan, what amount we shall obtain, and\r\n\r\nat  what rate subscriptions will come in. In the third\r\n\r\nplace,  it is considered only fair that the  hands  of\r\n\r\nthe  incoming Government should not be tied in advance\r\n\r\nbut  that it should be given a reasonably clear  field\r\n\r\nto  implement its own ideas in respect of  new  works,\r\n\r\nwithin the limits of funds likely to be available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the first reason, this is really a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the extent to which we can make  further\r\n\r\ncalls on reserves to finance development. It would  be\r\n\r\ndangerous  to  allow our reserves to be run  down  too\r\n\r\nfar. We must safeguard ourselves against the financial\r\n\r\nconsequences of a severe recession in trade;  we  must\r\n\r\nretain enough to finance public works as a measure  of\r\n\r\nunemployment relief in time of depression; we must  be\r\n\r\nable to meet all unforeseen contingencies; and we must\r\n\r\nat all times have sufficient to serve as a revenue and\r\n\r\nexpenditure equalisation reserve. I should not like to\r\n\r\nsee our general revenue balance reduced much below $65\r\n\r\nmillion  at  the  present time.  Our  general  revenue\r\n\r\nbalance  at the end of 1958 should be of the order  of\r\n\r\n$83  million  and  we can perhaps  afford  to  make  a\r\n\r\nfurther  and  final  allocation of  $18  million  from\r\n\r\nreserves to development. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallocation, in addition to an allocation from  revenue\r\n\r\nof  $20 million and sums resulting from the payment of\r\n\r\nloans,  will  enable  us to finance  with  safety  and\r\n\r\ncertainty   the  programme  outlined  in   the   Draft\r\n\r\nEstimates in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second reason, namely the fact\r\n\r\nthat development will in the future have to rely to  a\r\n\r\ngreat extent on loan finance and that the prospects of\r\n\r\nloan floatation in the future are uncertain, there are\r\n\r\na number of points on which I should like to touch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, the question of reliance on loan\r\n\r\nfinance  in the future. Over the past four  years,  we\r\n\r\nhave  spent  an  average  of $55  million  a  year  on\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   It   has  been   spent   on   essential\r\n\r\ndevelopment - on housing on which $56 million  has  been\r\n\r\nspent  in providing 9,000 living units, on schools  of\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have  provided  68  primary  and  secondary\r\n\r\nschools, on medical facilities, on communications  and\r\n\r\nrural  development. Part of this expenditure has  been\r\n\r\nmet from substantial annual contributions from revenue\r\n\r\nand  the balance has been met from reserves which have\r\n\r\naccumulated  as  a  result  of  the  prosperity  which\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  experienced since the  war.  It  seems\r\n\r\nlikely  that  the demands of Singapore for development\r\n\r\nwill  continue on much the same scale.  One  does  not\r\n\r\nhave  to look beyond the growth of population for  the\r\n\r\nreason.  It  is  hoped - indeed it is essential - that  it\r\n\r\nwill  continue to be possible to finance a substantial\r\n\r\npart  of development from revenue. But this will  only\r\n\r\ngo  a  part  of  the way to meet the total  bill.  The\r\n\r\ngreater part will have to be financed from loans.  And\r\n\r\nthe total available from all sources will not meet all\r\n\r\ndemands.  There will have to be a strict  planning  of\r\n\r\npriorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as regards the raising of loans, it must be\r\n\r\nconfessed that the prospects seem to be becoming  less\r\n\r\nand less bright. Looking back over the years since the\r\n\r\nwar,  Singapore has had a quite astonishing record  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  loan  floatation is concerned. In  1946,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  raised a $50 million rehabilitation  loan.\r\n\r\nSince  that  date,  the  City Council,  excluding  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent  loan,  has  raised  7  loans  totalling  $220\r\n\r\nmillion in all. I doubt if any territory of comparable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsize  has anything like this record. It speaks volumes\r\n\r\nfor  the prosperity and stability of Singapore and for\r\n\r\nthe  external reputation of the business acumen of its\r\n\r\ncitizens and the soundness of its administration.  But\r\n\r\nthe   fact  of  the  matter  is  that  it  has  become\r\n\r\nincreasingly  difficult to float loans over  the  past\r\n\r\nfour years. In the first place, in a period of general\r\n\r\ninflation, there is an increasing reluctance to tie up\r\n\r\nlarge  sums  in long term low interest bearing  loans.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  money has become increasingly  tighter  and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe banks and other bodies which subscribed handsomely\r\n\r\nto loans in the past have no longer the same resources\r\n\r\nto  do  so.  Thirdly, a large number  of  the  private\r\n\r\nprovident funds which invested in Government and  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  loans  in  the past have  been  wound  up  or\r\n\r\nreduced in scope. Fourthly, there is the disability of\r\n\r\nthe  lack of an active local market for Government and\r\n\r\nCity  Council  stocks. Lastly, with so much  political\r\n\r\nchange  and  uncertainty  in the  air,  investors  are\r\n\r\nunwilling  to  commit large sums until  they  see  how\r\n\r\nthings  are going to develop. The net result is  that,\r\n\r\nat   the   present  time,  with  one  or  two  notable\r\n\r\nexceptions,  the Central Provident Fund is practically\r\n\r\nthe  sole  contributor to local loans. In  short,  the\r\n\r\nprospects of raising loans are not particularly bright\r\n\r\nat  the  moment. Nor do I think that they will improve\r\n\r\nuntil  uncertainty is removed from the political scene\r\n\r\nand  investors  are satisfied that  the  attitude  and\r\n\r\npolicies of the Government in power in the future  are\r\n\r\nlikely to be such that the investment of large sums on\r\n\r\nlong  term is safe. In short, one cannot say with  any\r\n\r\ndegree  of  certainty how much it will be possible  to\r\n\r\nraise  by  way  of  loan in 1959 and  1960.  In  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  the  Government  is  not   unnaturally\r\n\r\nreluctant  to enter into any commitments  which  would\r\n\r\nhave to be met from loans until it is clearer just how\r\n\r\nmuch  can actually be expected, and when and  at  what\r\n\r\nrate the  funds are likely to become available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there are certain factors about the\r\n\r\nimmediate  future  which perhaps alleviate  the  gloom\r\n\r\nwhich I may possibly have spread. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink  that the Central Provident Fund can be  counted\r\n\r\nupon  to support a Government loan, Secondly, the 1940\r\n\r\nWar  Loan is due for redemption in October, 1959  and,\r\n\r\nif  suitable terms are offered, it may be possible  to\r\n\r\npersuade holders of this stock to convert into  a  new\r\n\r\nloan. In this connection, consideration might possibly\r\n\r\nbe  given  to a conversion issue on the lines  of  the\r\n\r\nrecent  Australian conversion issue. Thirdly, I  think\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  probable that, if the  revision  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  Currency Agreement between  the  Federation,\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo  and the Singapore Governments at  present\r\n\r\nunder discussion goes through, the Currency Board  may\r\n\r\nbe  prepared  to  invest a certain percentage  of  the\r\n\r\nCurrency  Fund in a Singapore Government loan,  taking\r\n\r\ncare  of course that adequate backing for the currency\r\n\r\nis  maintained. But these are all to a certain  extent\r\n\r\nuncertain  factors.  Whether they materialise  or  not\r\n\r\nwill  depend  to  a  large  extent  on  the  political\r\n\r\nclimate,  and  on  the  acts  as  distinct  from   the\r\n\r\nprotestations of the Government in power at the  time.\r\n\r\nLastly it is considered desirable to give the incoming\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment as clear a field as possible in  the  field\r\n\r\nof  new development and not to tie its hands more than\r\n\r\nnecessary  with  heavy  commitments  from  the   past.\r\n\r\nDevelopment  projects  are costly  and  even  a  small\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber  of them demand large sums over a comparatively\r\n\r\nlong  period. It is probable that the funds  available\r\n\r\nfor  development  in the future will be  more  limited\r\n\r\nthan  in  the  past.  It will be necessary  to  assess\r\n\r\npriorities  and  plan  expenditure  with  great  care.\r\n\r\nThoughts may change about the emphasis which should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaced  on  the different branches of development  and\r\n\r\nabout the standards which should be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development estimates, drawn up with the limited\r\n\r\nscope  the reason for which I have described,  provide\r\n\r\nfor  expenditure of $42 million of which $20.8 million\r\n\r\nis  Special Development expenditure and $21.2  million\r\n\r\nPublic   Works   Non   Recurrent   expenditure.   This\r\n\r\nexpenditure  compares with actual expenditure  of  $48\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1955, $50 million in 1956, $62 million  in\r\n\r\n1957 and an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestimated  $62  million in 1958. As  I  said  earlier,\r\n\r\nprovision is made in the main for completion  of  work\r\n\r\nactually  in hand at the end of the year. $700,000  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  the completion of schemes for  quarters\r\n\r\nfor  the  Police  now  in hand principally  at  Duxton\r\n\r\nPlain.   $1.4  million  has  been  provided  for   the\r\n\r\nReformative Training Centre or Borstal institution  at\r\n\r\nChangi which will meet a pressing need. $7 million has\r\n\r\nbeen  provided  for  the  further  implementation   of\r\n\r\nschemes  under Programmes 6, 7 and 8 by the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust, and $340,000 has been provided  for\r\n\r\na  Malay  Resettlement Housing Scheme, the details  of\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Minister  will, I am  sure,  be  happy  to\r\n\r\ndescribe.  $2.2  million has  been  provided  for  the\r\n\r\ncontinuation of work in hand in the rural  areas.  The\r\n\r\nprovision  compares  with actual expenditure  of  $2.8\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1956, $3.8 million in 1957 and  estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  $3.6 million 1958. A  total  of  $8.2\r\n\r\nmillion has been provided for Education. Of this  $2.5\r\n\r\nmillion refers to special expenditure and $5.3 million\r\n\r\nto  capital works. Capital grants to schools have been\r\n\r\nlimited to revotes of sums voted in 1958 but not taken\r\n\r\nup.   $4.4   million   has  been  provided   for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  primary  and  secondary  schools  in\r\n\r\ncompletion of programmes now in hand. $1.4 million has\r\n\r\nbeen  provided for the Raffles National Library  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  completed in 1960. Under Medical, the  first\r\n\r\nhalf  of  a contribution of $850,000 is made  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  a Hospital at Mt.  Alvernia  by  the\r\n\r\nFranciscan  Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood.  In\r\n\r\naddition     to    providing    additional    hospital\r\n\r\naccommodation, this will provide much needed  training\r\n\r\nfacilities for nurses. $5 million is provided for  the\r\n\r\ncompletion of capital works in hospitals. Under  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation,  $800,000  is  provided  for  work  on   the\r\n\r\noperational  building  at the airport  which  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted in 1960 and $1.6 million for further work on\r\n\r\nthe airport itself. $2 million is provided for further\r\n\r\nexpansion  of the revenue producing telecommunications\r\n\r\nservices.  $3.3  million  is provided  under  P.W.N.R.\r\n\r\n(General) of which over $1 million refers to flood\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelief  measures  and  $1.5 million  for  unemployment\r\n\r\nrelief  works,  which  will  take  the  form  of  road\r\n\r\ndevelopment in rural areas and the necessary extension\r\n\r\nof the Airport runway to cater for jet aircraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, expenditure on works and buildings is\r\n\r\nestimated   at  $21.2  million  which  compares   with\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  $21 million in 1955, $22  million  in\r\n\r\n1956,  $21  million  in 1957 and  an  estimated  $21.4\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1958.  It should be  sufficient  to  keep\r\n\r\ncontractors and their labour employed at least until a\r\n\r\nsupplementary programme is drawn up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Special Expenditure, $7 million is provided for\r\n\r\nfurther  work  by  the  Singapore  Improvement   Trust\r\n\r\ncompared with an expenditure of $8 million in 1955, $9\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1956, $18 million in 1957 and an estimated\r\n\r\n$21 million in 1958. Housing must have a high priority\r\n\r\nin  whatever development plans are implemented in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  and  the next Government will no  doubt  give\r\n\r\nconsideration to this matter as soon as possible after\r\n\r\nit  comes  to power. At the same time, it  is  thought\r\n\r\nthat  it  will  have to be accepted that,  in  future,\r\n\r\nfewer housing units can be built each year than in the\r\n\r\nrecent  past.  The fact of the matter is that,  having\r\n\r\nregard  to the competing claims of schools, hospitals,\r\n\r\nclinics  and other similar works and to the amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney likely to be available for them, it will not  be\r\n\r\npossible  to make as much money available for  housing\r\n\r\nas  it  has  been  in the past. I do  not  think  that\r\n\r\nanybody  could  reasonably expect that expenditure  on\r\n\r\nhousing  should  be maintained at the average  of  $20\r\n\r\nmillion of the past two years. A more likely figure is\r\n\r\nperhaps $10 million which is nearer the average of the\r\n\r\nyears preceding 1957 and 1958. It may be said that the\r\n\r\nanswer  is  to reduce standards, that in the  past  we\r\n\r\nhave  built too well. But I beg leave to doubt if very\r\n\r\nmuch  can be achieved in this direction. I think  that\r\n\r\nit will be generally agreed that Singapore improvement\r\n\r\nTrust costs are as low as they can possibly be for the\r\n\r\ntype of accommodation which is produced. Something can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossibly  be  achieved  in the direction  of  one-room\r\n\r\nflatlets - a  development  of  the  Hongkong  idea.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  been  working  on  this  complicated\r\n\r\nproblem  for  some  time.  Again,  something  may   be\r\n\r\nachieved  by decentralising housing and building  more\r\n\r\nin  rural  areas  where  land  is  cheaper  and  semi-permanent   accommodation  can  be  built  with   less\r\n\r\nobjection.  This  is  also  a  problem  on  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  been  working  but   it   also   has\r\n\r\ndifficulties of its own. Something may be achieved  in\r\n\r\nthese  directions  to  make  the  funds  available  go\r\n\r\nfurther  in terms of housing units but it is  doubtful\r\n\r\nif  it can be substantial. In short, unless the amount\r\n\r\nof   loan   money  obtained  in  the  future   exceeds\r\n\r\nexpectations, we must reconcile ourselves  to  a  more\r\n\r\nrestricted housing programme than has been achieved in\r\n\r\nthe  past.  On  the  other hand, we  can  congratulate\r\n\r\nourselves  that  we have been able to  build  so  many\r\n\r\nunits  of  such good quality as we have  done  in  the\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may possibly be suggested that this limited\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programme  will  lead  to  a  hiatus   in\r\n\r\ndevelopment, that plans will not be ready when a  loan\r\n\r\nhas  been  successfully floated and the new Government\r\n\r\nwishes  to  go ahead. This is not the case. Plans  now\r\n\r\nexist,  or are in course of preparation, for  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  the items to which the present  Government\r\n\r\nattached  a  high  priority and  which  have  hitherto\r\n\r\nappeared  in the Estimates with a token vote  awaiting\r\n\r\ntheir  turn  to  be  brought  forward.  Planning  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  and, in so far as the new Government  wishes\r\n\r\nto  proceed  with  projects of its predecessor,  there\r\n\r\nshould   be   no   delay.  Similarly,  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust can go ahead when given the word  to\r\n\r\nthe  limit of the funds which the Government considers\r\n\r\ncan  be  made available for housing in the future.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as volume of work and employment is concerned,  I\r\n\r\nthink that the Draft Estimates provide enough to  keep\r\n\r\nthe   building   and  allied  trades   going   for   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable time. Overall, in terms of dollars and on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  past performance, we are providing  in\r\n\r\nthis limited development budget for at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleast two-thirds of what has in the past been a normal\r\n\r\nyear's  expenditure, and this should keep the  various\r\n\r\nbranches of the building industry going until the  new\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  had  an  opportunity  to  frame   its\r\n\r\nsupplementary development budget in the light  of  its\r\n\r\ndeclared   policies  and  the  funds  likely   to   be\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nreview  the record of the Government in the  financial\r\n\r\nfield. When the Government assumed office in 1955,  it\r\n\r\ninherited  a financial position which was very  sound.\r\n\r\nThe  public debt was small. Reserves were substantial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  out-turn  for each year had shown  a  substantial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurplus.  At  the  same  time,  the  future  presented\r\n\r\ncertain  problems.  Expenditure, particularly  on  the\r\n\r\nsocial  services, was mounting and revenue had  to  be\r\n\r\nincreased to meet it. Expenditure had to be kept under\r\n\r\nstrict  control. Care had to be taken that accumulated\r\n\r\nreserves were not squandered in the implementation  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plans.  These  problems  have  all   been\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  solved.  Revenue  has  been   increased.\r\n\r\nExpenditure  has been kept under control.  Accumulated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunds  have been used to best advantage. Now,  on  the\r\n\r\neve of the end of its term of office, the position  is\r\n\r\nstill  very  sound. The public debt remains  unchanged\r\n\r\nand  adequate provision continues to be made  for  its\r\n\r\nredemption.  Basic reserves are adequate.  The  budget\r\n\r\nhas  been  virtually balanced. A great deal  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved  in  the  way  of development.  Security  and\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  Singapore as one of the  main  trading\r\n\r\ncentres of the world have been maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During its period of office, the Government has\r\n\r\nincreased revenue from a total of $207 million in 1954\r\n\r\nto  an  estimated total of $264 million  in  1959,  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  27  per cent. Company tax,  income  tax,\r\n\r\nestate  duty, customs duties on tobacco,  liquors  and\r\n\r\npetrol,  stamp duty, totalisator duty, driving licence\r\n\r\nfees  and  initial registration fees on cars have  all\r\n\r\nbeen   increased,   and  other  measures   have   been\r\n\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe increases have been achieved within the pattern of\r\n\r\ntaxation  to which the population has been accustomed.\r\n\r\nNothing  has  been  done  to  upset  the  economy   of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  incidence of  taxation  has  been  in\r\n\r\nstrict  proportion to capacity to pay and no  hardship\r\n\r\nhas been caused to anyone. The increases have not been\r\n\r\nuniformly popular. It was not expected that they would\r\n\r\nbe.  But  the  Government has not been concerned  with\r\n\r\npopularity in these matters. It has merely  done  what\r\n\r\nwas required to make income meet expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure has increased, particularly in the social\r\n\r\nservices. It has risen from a total of $197 million in\r\n\r\n1954  to  an estimated total of $264 million in  1959.\r\n\r\nExpenditure on Education has risen from $30 million in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1954 to an estimate of $63 million in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on Medical and Health has risen from $20\r\n\r\nmillion in 1954 to an estimate of $34 million in 1959.\r\n\r\nExpenditure  on  Social  Welfare  has  risen  from  $7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion  to  $11  million over the  same  period.  But\r\n\r\nexpenditure has always been kept under strict control.\r\n\r\nIt  has  never  been allowed to get out of  hand.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npressures  which were inevitable on the first  elected\r\n\r\ngovernment to spend lavishly on vote-catching projects\r\n\r\nhave  always been strenuously resisted. Provision  has\r\n\r\nbeen   made  for  services  which  were  regarded   as\r\n\r\nessential.  Extravagance and waste have  been  rigidly\r\n\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these measures, the Government has\r\n\r\nbeen  able to pay its way. Now, at the end of its term\r\n\r\nof  office,  it has managed to present a budget  which\r\n\r\ncomes  within  $4 million of being balanced.  This,  I\r\n\r\nthink, is a most notable achievement in every respect.\r\n\r\nA balanced budget is essential for financial viability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the maintenance of confidence in Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nmajor trading centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of development, the achievements of the\r\n\r\nGovernment have been equally impressive. In all,  $223\r\n\r\nmillion  has been spent on development, including  $56\r\n\r\nmillion on housing and $85 million on other works  and\r\n\r\nbuildings. In the field of public housing,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover  9,000  units and 300 shops will have been  built\r\n\r\nwithin the lifetime of the Government, out of a  total\r\n\r\nof  just  over 20,000. In the field of Education,  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  has  been  completed  and  will   provide\r\n\r\nadvanced  technical education for 4,000  students.  59\r\n\r\nprimary  and 9 secondary schools have been built.  The\r\n\r\ntotal  school population has increased by 66 per  cent\r\n\r\nduring  the lifetime of the government and  there  are\r\n\r\nnow  over 300.000 pupils in all categories of schools.\r\n\r\nA  new  Teachers Training College has been  built  and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining   facilities,  particularly  for   vernacular\r\n\r\nschool teachers, have been greatly increased. In 1958,\r\n\r\n2,300 teachers were in training compared with 1,760 in\r\n\r\n1954. In the Medical field, considerable additions and\r\n\r\nimprovements  have  been made to  hospitals,  and  bed\r\n\r\naccommodation has risen from 4,500 in 1954 to 6,500 in\r\n\r\n1958,  an increase of 44 per cent. In the near future,\r\n\r\nthe  new  hospital  for the chronic sick  and  further\r\n\r\naccommodation at Kandang Kerbau will be opened, and  a\r\n\r\nfurther  525  beds will be available, making  a  total\r\n\r\nincrease  of 55 per cent. Outpatient Departments  have\r\n\r\nincreased  from 4 to 14 and 6 more will be  opened  in\r\n\r\n1959.  The  number  of  Maternity  and  Child  Welfare\r\n\r\nClinics  has  risen from 44 to 60.  In  the  field  of\r\n\r\ncommunications generally, the International Airport is\r\n\r\nin  operation,  the Merdeka Bridge and Nicoll  Highway\r\n\r\nhave  been completed, 9 miles of dual carriage-way  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bukit Timah road have been finished. 35 miles  of\r\n\r\nother  metalled roads have been brought into use,  and\r\n\r\n80  miles  of  earth roads in rural  areas  have  been\r\n\r\nconstructed  in the last year. 6 new post offices  and\r\n\r\n22  new  postal agencies have been opened and  84  new\r\n\r\nletter boxes have been installed. Some $12 million has\r\n\r\nbeen spent on rural development over the past 4 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remarkable progress has been made in the sphere of\r\n\r\nanimal husbandry. Based on the new stations at Lim Chu\r\n\r\nKang   and   Sembawang,  teams   of   veterinary   and\r\n\r\nagricultural officers have brought extension  services\r\n\r\nto  the kampongs. As a result, the pig population  has\r\n\r\nbeen  increased  from 287,000 in 1954  to  450,000  in\r\n\r\n1958,  and  the poultry population from 5  million  to\r\n\r\nabout 24\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion  over  the  same period. In  1958,  6  million\r\n\r\nchickens were inoculated against disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of industrial development, an Industrial\r\n\r\nPromotions  Board  has  been established,  legislation\r\n\r\ngiving  tax relief to selected industries  is  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of being introduced, arrangements  are  being\r\n\r\nmade for the protection of selected industries, and  a\r\n\r\n\"Buy  Singapore\" campaign is about to  be  started.  A\r\n\r\nTourist Promotion Bureau has been established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations are at present in progress with the\r\n\r\nGovernments  of  the  Federation of  Malaya,  Sarawak,\r\n\r\nNorth Borneo and Brunei for a revision of the existing\r\n\r\nCurrency Agreement which, if successful, will maintain\r\n\r\nthe  Currency  Commission in  being  and  the  Malayan\r\n\r\ndollar  in  circulation for a  period  of  years,  and\r\n\r\nenable the Currency Commission to invest a portion  of\r\n\r\nthe Currency Fund in local government stocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the record of the present Government in the\r\n\r\nfinancial  field. It is one of which a  first  elected\r\n\r\ngovernment in any country might well be proud.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe   outcome   of   the  courage,   moderation,   and\r\n\r\ncommonsense    which   have   been   the   outstanding\r\n\r\ncharacteristics  of  the  elected   Members   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment with whom it has been the privilege of  ex-officio Members to be associated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incoming government will continue to face many\r\n\r\nproblems  in  the financial and economic field.  These\r\n\r\nproblems    will    require   for    their    solution\r\n\r\nstatesmanship,  an appreciation of the  importance  of\r\n\r\nissues  wider  than  local  party  politics,   and   a\r\n\r\nrealisation   of  the  need  to  maintain  confidence,\r\n\r\ninternally and externally, in Singapore as a centre of\r\n\r\nfinance,   shipping,  communications  and   trade   of\r\n\r\ninternational importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem will be to reach an understanding\r\n\r\nwith the Government of the Federation of Malaya in the\r\n\r\nfield   of  monetary,  fiscal  and  economic   policy.\r\n\r\nFortunately,  the  wisdom and  farsightedness  of  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Federation in agreeing to  remain  a\r\n\r\nparty  to the existing Currency Agreement, subject  to\r\n\r\ncertain    amendments   which   should   present    no\r\n\r\ndifficulties to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  parties,  and to continue to use  the  existing\r\n\r\nMalayan  dollar  for the time being, has  given  us  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of grace in which to reach agreement on  these\r\n\r\nmatters.  For  agreement there must be. In  my  humble\r\n\r\nopinion, while an integrated Pan-Malayan economy would\r\n\r\nbe  to the incalculable advantage of both territories,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  no satisfactory future unless  she  is\r\n\r\nassociated  in  the  closest  possible  way  fiscally,\r\n\r\nfinancially and economically with the Federation.  All\r\n\r\npossible efforts must be directed over the next two or\r\n\r\nthree years to achieving this association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem will be to raise revenue to meet\r\n\r\nmounting  expenditure. I do not say that the  measures\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government have introduced have  exhausted\r\n\r\nthe  taxation  potential of Singapore. But  they  have\r\n\r\ngone a considerable way towards doing so, and the  new\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  be considerably  exercised  to  find\r\n\r\nmeans of taxation which will not weigh penally on  any\r\n\r\nparticular  section  of  the  community  or   business\r\n\r\ninterests  in  Singapore,  which  will  not  harm  the\r\n\r\neconomy, and which at the same time will fit into  the\r\n\r\nPan-Malayan fiscal scheme which it must be its aim  to\r\n\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mounting expenditure on the social services,\r\n\r\nparticularly education, will be a major problem facing\r\n\r\nthe  new Government. Each year 50,000 children  demand\r\n\r\neducation  in  primary schools. This  demand  requires\r\n\r\nmore  schools, more equipment, and more  teachers.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  there are heavy and increasing  commitments\r\n\r\nin  the field of higher education. Statistics for  the\r\n\r\npast  four  years suggest that the recurrent  cost  of\r\n\r\neducation  will  increase by at least  $10  million  a\r\n\r\nyear,  and possibly more, in the future. Having regard\r\n\r\nto  the  difficulties of raising revenue, to the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  recurrent  expenditure on  other  services  will\r\n\r\ninevitably increase, it will clearly be difficult,  if\r\n\r\nnot  impossible, to meet a bill for education of  this\r\n\r\nmagnitude.  It  is clear that means will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nfound to reduce it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major problem will be the question of\r\n\r\nplanning development in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears   to  come.  I  have  already  touched  on   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  which are likely to  be  experienced  in\r\n\r\nraising loans in the future and on the need to  pursue\r\n\r\npolicies,  not  only in the central but  also  in  the\r\n\r\nlocal  government  which will  commend  themselves  to\r\n\r\nwould-be  investors.  I  have also  at  various  times\r\n\r\nstressed   the   necessity  of  continuing   to   make\r\n\r\nsubstantial  annual  contributions  from  revenue   to\r\n\r\ndevelopment. At the same time, even allowing  for  the\r\n\r\ncreation of the most favourable climate for investment\r\n\r\nand  for  the most substantial contributions from  the\r\n\r\nrevenues of all interested authorities, it seems  more\r\n\r\nthan probable that demands for development expenditure\r\n\r\nby  central and local government authorities will  far\r\n\r\noutstrip  the capacity of these authorities  to  raise\r\n\r\nfunds, that development will have to be planned on  an\r\n\r\nisland-wide  basis  with  the  strictest  regard   for\r\n\r\npriorities,  and that development expenditure  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  will  have  to be on a greatly  reduced  scale\r\n\r\ncompared  with  what it has been in the  past  decade.\r\n\r\nThis  will  not  be  an easy task. Each  claimant  for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunds,  whether  it  be the Minister  for  Housing  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  public  housing,  or  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation  in respect of schools or higher educational\r\n\r\nfacilities, or the Minister for Health in  respect  of\r\n\r\nhospital  beds  and  clinics, or the  City  Electrical\r\n\r\nEngineer  in respect of power or light, or the  Health\r\n\r\nauthorities  in respect of sewage, will consider  that\r\n\r\nhis  claim  is more important than all the others.  It\r\n\r\nwill  be  an  exceedingly difficult task  to  allocate\r\n\r\npriorities amongst the various claimants and  to  draw\r\n\r\nup  plans  for  some years ahead in the light  of  the\r\n\r\nfunds  likely  to be available. The task  of  deciding\r\n\r\npriorities  and  how much should be  devoted  to  each\r\n\r\npriority  and  over what period is a  matter  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   after  consultation  with   the   various\r\n\r\ninterests  concerned; but it is a  matter  which  will\r\n\r\ndemand  the greatest goodwill and co-operation in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  Singapore, and will call for  knowledge\r\n\r\nand  ability of the highest order on the part  of  the\r\n\r\nplanning authorities.

Chinese education was not\r\n\r\nthe  concern of the Government at the time because  it\r\n\r\nwas not part of the Government educational programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from giving partial aid to Chinese schools, the\r\n\r\nGovernment then was not committed to Chinese education\r\n\r\nin any way. Nanyang University\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproceeded  under its own steam from  the  day  of  its\r\n\r\nregistration as a limited company providing courses of\r\n\r\nstudy  in Arts, Science and Commerce, entirely on  its\r\n\r\nown.  There was no consultation between them  and  the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Education before the introduction of the\r\n\r\nMinisterial  form of Government and later  on  between\r\n\r\nthem  and  the Ministry of Education. Such a state  of\r\n\r\naffairs   was   clearly  unsatisfactory   and   indeed\r\n\r\nundesirable  because,  unless  the  University  had  a\r\n\r\nsystem  and  courses of study that can fit  themselves\r\n\r\ninto  the  local pattern of education,  the  graduates\r\n\r\nwill  find  very  little outlet after they  have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough the portals of the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October, 1956, when the Government committed\r\n\r\nitself  to  Chinese  education  with  the  opening  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  Chinese  schools  as  a  result   of   the\r\n\r\nstudents'  unrest,  the chance had come  for  bringing\r\n\r\nNanyang  University into the whole educational  set-up\r\n\r\nin   Singapore.   Because  Nanyang   University,   was\r\n\r\nessentially a private institution, it is natural  that\r\n\r\nto  bring it into the setup it must meet with  various\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say that the time had come to bring Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  into  the  whole  educational  set-up   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, I do not mean that Nanyang University would\r\n\r\nbe   a   Government  institution  or  even  Government\r\n\r\nsponsored,  but  it  would  be  an  institution   with\r\n\r\nGovernment  representation so as to make certain  that\r\n\r\nGovernment's views are brought to the attention of the\r\n\r\npeople who run it and vice versa, and so that it  will\r\n\r\nnot  develop into a foreign university. Can we imagine\r\n\r\na  university in Singapore providing education for our\r\n\r\nchildren under a system foreign to ours?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that this Bill has come very closely upon\r\n\r\nthe  recent Government decision to give financial  aid\r\n\r\nto  Nanyang University. What better evidence can there\r\n\r\nbe  of the sincere desires of both the University  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to see that hereafter the  University\r\n\r\nshould  form part of the educational system. Also  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of a Commission to examine the  standards\r\n\r\nof Nanyang University should clear the doubts of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  once  and  for all whether  both  parties  are\r\n\r\ndetermined  to  see  that the  academic  standards  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University are adequate  and  worthy  of  its\r\n\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission is expected to assemble some time in\r\n\r\nFebruary next year and it is my earnest hope that  the\r\n\r\nCommission will be able to accomplish its task  within\r\n\r\nthe  time  set  for it. Meanwhile I  hope  that  those\r\n\r\npersons who are now responsible for the academic  work\r\n\r\nand administration in the University will maintain the\r\n\r\nhighest standards possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Bill itself, I want to draw Members'\r\n\r\nattention   to  the  cardinal  principle,   that   the\r\n\r\nadministrative and the academic must remain  separate.\r\n\r\nFor the administration of the University, clause 19 of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Bill provides for a University Council consisting\r\n\r\nof  the  President of the University and  twenty-seven\r\n\r\nother members. Three of the twenty-seven members  will\r\n\r\nbe  Government nominees, two members from  Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Senate,  two members from the Guild of  Graduates\r\n\r\nwhen  there is one, and the rest elected from  members\r\n\r\nof the University. The membership of the University is\r\n\r\na special feature in the Bill because many people have\r\n\r\ncontributed  various sums of money to  the  University\r\n\r\nwhen  it was established in 1954, and obviously  these\r\n\r\nbenefactors cannot be forgotten with the incorporation\r\n\r\nof the University under the law of Singapore. Clause 8\r\n\r\nof the Bill provides for this membership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 of the Bill provides for a University\r\n\r\nSenate  who will be responsible for academic  matters.\r\n\r\nLooking further ahead we have provided for a Guild  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraduates under clause 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 provides for a Council. In the Council, the\r\n\r\nmembers  will  be elected for a period  of  two  years\r\n\r\nconsisting  of the Chairman (elected), a Vice-Chairman\r\n\r\n(elected),  the President, who shall be the  executive\r\n\r\nand  academic  officer of the University  and  also  a\r\n\r\nmember  of every Committee. The President is  actually\r\n\r\nequivalent to the Vice-Chancellor and, in addition, we\r\n\r\nwill  have a Secretary appointed by the Council and  a\r\n\r\nTreasurer who may be a salaried officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the main features of the Bill before the\r\n\r\nHouse and the rest is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter  of detail.

Sir,\r\n\r\nNanyang  University was created as a  private  limited\r\n\r\ncompany, but when this Bill is passed by the Assembly,\r\n\r\nit  will  be  incorporated as  a  public  institution,\r\n\r\nhaving as it were come of age. It is befitting that on\r\n\r\ncoming of age it should be recognised by Government by\r\n\r\nhaving  three  members  of its Council  of  Management\r\n\r\nnominated  by  the Council of Ministers and  having  a\r\n\r\ngrant  of  $854,000  for current expenses  and  future\r\n\r\nbursaries.  This  grant, Sir, I  am  sure  is  only  a\r\n\r\nbeginning   and  when  the  University  enlarges   its\r\n\r\nactivities,  larger  grants  will  be  made.   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity has filled a gap in our educational  system\r\n\r\nby  providing post-graduate education for our children\r\n\r\nwho have attended Chinese schools; because, until this\r\n\r\nUniversity  started, there was no place for  them  for\r\n\r\nfurther studies unless they left for foreign shores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure, Sir, that Nanyang University and\r\n\r\nthe University of Malaya will in the future provide\r\n\r\nmost of the men we require to run the very complex\r\n\r\nbusiness of self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to thank the founders and generous\r\n\r\ndonors for their courage and foresight in providing\r\n\r\nsuch an institution to fill a very vital need for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heartily support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.57 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, despite the\r\n\r\ngloomy political and economic picture during the  last\r\n\r\nfew  months,  this is a very beneficial  move  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I extend my hearty congratulations to the Government,\r\n\r\nespecially to the Minister for Education, for  finally\r\n\r\nlaunching this important Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not only going to support the speech just\r\n\r\ndelivered by the Member for Paya Lebar who extends his\r\n\r\nthanks to the founders of the University, but I  would\r\n\r\nalso  call  upon  this House to place  on  record  the\r\n\r\nbeneficient  gesture  and the  courage  shown  by  the\r\n\r\nfounders  of  the Nanyang University, and particularly\r\n\r\nthe support of the taxi-drivers, trisha-riders, coffee-shop assistants and amahs who have contributed to make\r\n\r\nNanyang University possible. I would also like to call\r\n\r\nupon  this House to recognise the fact that this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  of  significant importance. I expect it  will  not\r\n\r\nonly meet with popular support but will also meet with\r\n\r\nunanimous approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Nanyang University is the result of a movement\r\n\r\nwhich has proved that our people are able and prepared\r\n\r\nto accept the challenge of the future, irrespective of\r\n\r\nrace,  culture and religion - a movement with  a  united\r\n\r\nforce.  I  particularly appeal to Malayan  readers  to\r\n\r\nrealise   this,  no  matter  what  barrier  has   been\r\n\r\ncreated - Malayan  Malays  and  Malayan   Chinese.   The\r\n\r\ncreation of Nanyang University has sown certain doubts\r\n\r\nand fears particularly among the Malay community. Sir,\r\n\r\nI  think  this  is  now  the opportunity  for  Malayan\r\n\r\nleaders  to  speak their minds on what they  think  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University. What do they think  of  the  mass\r\n\r\nsupport  given  to this University, and  what  is  the\r\n\r\nimportance of this University in the future?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is high time for all the\r\n\r\ncommunities,  not only the Malays, to  recognise  that\r\n\r\nNanyang  University belongs to the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nas  well  as Malaya. Judging by the number of students\r\n\r\nattending the University today, more than 60 per  cent\r\n\r\nof them come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom   the  Federation,  it  is  therefore  a  clearly\r\n\r\naccepted  fact  that  local  consciousness  and  local\r\n\r\nloyalty  and  even  the building of a  greater  Malaya\r\n\r\nexist in their hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that from this year a Malay Department\r\n\r\nwill  be  set  up in Nanyang University.  I  ask  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  to consider whether this should be encouraged\r\n\r\nand,  if  so,  whether  it  should  be  enlarged   and\r\n\r\nstrengthened to cope with the political development in\r\n\r\nthis   country.  I  also  understand  that  an  Indian\r\n\r\nDepartment is about to be launched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is obvious that Nanyang University is no\r\n\r\nlonger  confined to the Chinese community, because  it\r\n\r\nis  already making an important contribution and is an\r\n\r\nimportant asset to this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we learn from the Minister for Education that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is  going  to  be committed  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  and I will therefore not go  into  details\r\n\r\nnow.  But I wish to add a few important points. First,\r\n\r\nis   it  possible  for  the  Singapore  Government  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  with the Federation of Malaya to  recognise\r\n\r\nthe  importance and the nature of Nan-yang  University\r\n\r\nand  to  give it not only their moral but  also  their\r\n\r\neconomic support?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, whether the Government of the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  the  Singapore  Government  can  give  an\r\n\r\nassurance  that  Nanyang University  degrees  will  be\r\n\r\nrecognised in future?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would ask the Government to recognise\r\n\r\nthat,  although  they have made a subsidy  to  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  this is but only a temporary measure  and\r\n\r\nthat a long-term economic aid policy will be drafted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I would urge the public to continue giving\r\n\r\nits  support to Nanyang University and should  not  be\r\n\r\nled  into  believing that, just because the Government\r\n\r\nhas  extended its support to the University,  its  own\r\n\r\nsupport  should be stopped. I wish to place on  record\r\n\r\nmy statement that public support is not only important\r\n\r\nbut also necessary at this juncture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish the Minister for Education would\r\n\r\ninclude the Students Union into the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> He said so!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think this is an appropriate time to\r\n\r\nsuspend.

I have been to the University many  a  time,\r\n\r\nand  I admire this fine institution and the work which\r\n\r\nit is doing and will do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Members from this side of the House said\r\n\r\nthat  it should be a University for all races. Let  me\r\n\r\ntell  him that there are quite a few Indians  who  are\r\n\r\nfull members and who were among the first to donate to\r\n\r\nthe founding of this institution. It is rather late in\r\n\r\nthe  day  for  this Government, now with  a  different\r\n\r\nlabel,  to acknowledge and help, and help only with  a\r\n\r\npaltry  sum.  I hope the future Government  will  give\r\n\r\nthis University its due place in the Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I must remind those in charge of the\r\n\r\nUniversity is that they should not produce people  who\r\n\r\nwill  do  clerical jobs only. The time will come  very\r\n\r\nsoon when we will be free and independent, and what we\r\n\r\nwant   is   to  run  our  own  country.  The  colonial\r\n\r\nperiod - 134  years  now - has  not  yet  produced  enough\r\n\r\npeople with required diplomas who could manage our own\r\n\r\naffairs. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  only recently we have been trying to send students\r\n\r\nto the universities abroad to get their diplomas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  to  provide equal  treatment  for  all\r\n\r\nschools. Why cannot the Minister for Education  accord\r\n\r\nto  Nanyang University the same treatment as is  given\r\n\r\nto  the  University of Malaya? As we all know, Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  came  into being through  the  efforts  of\r\n\r\ncertain  rich  merchants and  a  very  big  number  of\r\n\r\nworkers  of  all  types, who,  because  they  had  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  Chinese education  of  this  country  at\r\n\r\nheart,  voluntarily devoted their time  and  money  in\r\n\r\nbuilding Nanyang University in 1954.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University, established this year, will\r\n\r\nprovide  further  studies for those  students  leaving\r\n\r\nChinese  schools after they have passed Senior  Middle\r\n\r\nSchool   examinations.   I   cannot   understand   why\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  delay the recognition  of  degrees\r\n\r\nfrom Nanyang University. The University should deserve\r\n\r\nthe fullest support from Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also remind the Minister for Education that\r\n\r\n60  per  cent  of the students at present studying  in\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  are  from  the  Federation.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment should therefore make an attempt to try and\r\n\r\nget  financial support from the Federation Government.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the two Bills - one for the University of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaya  and the other for Nanyang University - you  will\r\n\r\nsee that there is discrimination. Why should there  be\r\n\r\ndiscrimination? Even the Nanyang University Students'\r\n\r\nUnion,  a very important organ of the University,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  left out of the Nanyang University Bill. Is  not\r\n\r\nthis  discrimination? Government, instead  of  showing\r\n\r\nequal treatment for all the students of Singapore,  is\r\n\r\nthinking  of  barring the students from forming  their\r\n\r\nunion.  The Minister for Education just said  that  he\r\n\r\nwill  amend  that clause. The students'  body  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Malaya also raise their  objection  to\r\n\r\nthis omission. I think it is the concern of Government\r\n\r\nthat Nanyang University should be put\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder its wing, and grant-in-aid extended to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as\r\n\r\none   of  the  eleven  original  founders  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  I thought I ought to rise,  not  only  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the Government, but to thank it for  bringing\r\n\r\nthis Bill to the Assembly. I might perhaps also try to\r\n\r\nclarify  some  of the misunderstandings about  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University was proposed at a time when the\r\n\r\nfounders  were  convinced that,  because  the  student\r\n\r\npopulation in the Chinese schools was very much bigger\r\n\r\nthan  that in the English schools, they had a need  to\r\n\r\ngo out for higher studies. That need was not available\r\n\r\nhere,  in  view  of the state that the  University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  was in. They could not accept enough  students\r\n\r\nso  as  to prevent them from being attracted to  China\r\n\r\nand   other  overseas  territories  for  their  higher\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start, a lot of misunderstanding was created\r\n\r\nand  there  was strong opposition to the establishment\r\n\r\nof  this  University, because it was thought that  the\r\n\r\nfounding  of  Nanyang University would divert  private\r\n\r\ndonations from the University of Malaya; and secondly,\r\n\r\nit  might create a divergence of loyalty. The founders\r\n\r\nwere  convinced that they would be helping the country\r\n\r\nby  helping to absorb these surplus students for their\r\n\r\nhigher  education. I hope it is now fully proved  that\r\n\r\nnot only does it not divert the common loyalty, but it\r\n\r\nis  also now taking in students whom the University of\r\n\r\nMalaya  cannot  take, students in  fact  from  English\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common misunderstanding about Nanyang University\r\n\r\nis perhaps this - as a Member has just mentioned - that it\r\n\r\nis only for Chinese education. In fact, it is not. Any\r\n\r\nstudent  of  Nanyang University must know English.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  a lot of the subjects in the faculties have  to\r\n\r\nbe  taught in English - Science, Commerce and  so  on - so\r\n\r\nthat, in fact, it is at least a bilingual university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was due to the unity of purpose of the founders\r\n\r\nand  the  people  that  we have been  able  to  create\r\n\r\nNanyang  University. Last year, Sir,  professors  from\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom who came over here and paid a visit\r\n\r\nto   the   University  had  variously  estimated   the\r\n\r\nbuildings, hostels, the library, including  the  three\r\n\r\nfaculties, to cost round about $25 million when we had\r\n\r\nactually spent about $6.8 million. I am still  one  of\r\n\r\nthe Treasurers of the University, and we know that the\r\n\r\ncost  of this University would, in fact, be less  than\r\n\r\nthat  of  the  Polytechnic  which  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nbuilding.  Now  that  is one of the  misunderstandings\r\n\r\nwhich  I  want to remove. It is not only a  university\r\n\r\nfor  Chinese learning. In fact, we already have  plans\r\n\r\nto  teach Malay. All students, whether they be  Malay,\r\n\r\nIndian, or even European would be equally welcome into\r\n\r\nthe   University.   We  hope   also   that   if   this\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  is removed, the  Government  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya will realise, as the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment, I think has fully realised now, that it is\r\n\r\nin  fact an undertaking on the same national basis  as\r\n\r\nthe  University  of  Malaya, and  will  give  it  more\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite recently, we had to debate whether an increase\r\n\r\nin  fees  should be introduced next year. The fees  at\r\n\r\nthe  start  were $30. The original students still  pay\r\n\r\n$30,  but for the students who joined last year,  they\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  pay  $60. For next year  it  has  been\r\n\r\nproposed  that  this  fee,  in  order  to  cover   the\r\n\r\nnecessary expenditure, should be increased to $100 per\r\n\r\npupil.  It  is  quite  understandable  that  with  the\r\n\r\npresent   trade  recession  the  merchants   who   had\r\n\r\noriginally  undertaken to contribute very  large  sums\r\n\r\nare  perhaps finding difficulty in doing so  now,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  of  Singapore  must  be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nsupport  Nanyang  University to  a  very  much  larger\r\n\r\nextent if it is to be kept going as it is now. I  also\r\n\r\nhope  the  Federation Government will fully understand\r\n\r\nthe  purposes of the University, and in time also give\r\n\r\ntheir support to it, since it has been pointed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  that over 60 per cent of the students in  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity are from the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwas  somewhat  disturbed to hear  the  speech  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) this morning.

Today I think they  all\r\n\r\njoin  in  paying tribute to an institution which  they\r\n\r\nall  know has the unquestioned support and loyalty and\r\n\r\nwhich symbolises the determination and ambition of the\r\n\r\nmass of the Chinese population throughout Malaya. Sir,\r\n\r\ntherefore it becomes a time when a few more votes  are\r\n\r\nattempted at. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nsay  how difficult it is for us to find a solution  to\r\n\r\nour  long-term  problems unless we have our  political\r\n\r\nleadership  willing,  able and courageous  enough,  to\r\n\r\nface up to its problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one great difference between Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  and the University of Malaya which  nobody\r\n\r\nhas pointed out, namely, when we passed the University\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  Ordinance, there was  a  parallel  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  There is none in the Nanyang  University.\r\n\r\nWhat  it means today is that it is a demonstration  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  answer to the conflict of forces in the Singapore\r\n\r\nsituation.   Within  the  context  of  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nsituation, with a population of 1\u00bd million of  which\r\n\r\na  little  over a million are Chinese, the  answer  is\r\n\r\nobvious.  With  a  resurgent  and  rejuvenated  China,\r\n\r\npowerful,  and with a proud people, where the  culture\r\n\r\nis  undergoing a renaissance, it is inevitable that it\r\n\r\nmust  find  its  ripples and its echoes in  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia,  and nowhere in South-East Asia amongst  the  15\r\n\r\nmillion  overseas Chinese are the overseas Chinese  so\r\n\r\nfortunately  placed as in Singapore.  Nowhere  in  the\r\n\r\ncapitals  of any of the independent nations in  South-East   Asia - Rangoon,  Bangkok,  Saigon,   Manila   and\r\n\r\nDjakarta - have Chinese commercial ability  and  trading\r\n\r\nskill won them a place of such importance. In none  of\r\n\r\nthem  are they able to wield the political power which\r\n\r\ntoday  makes  the  Government  openly  recognise   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of Nanyang University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this raises tremendous problems if we do not\r\n\r\nunderstand  the difference between the  long-term  and\r\n\r\nthe  short-term approach. If we want to look for a few\r\n\r\nvotes for next year's elections, then the line we  can\r\n\r\ntake in this Chamber, and outside in Press statements,\r\n\r\nwill  be different from the line we will take, if what\r\n\r\nwe  have  at heart is not a few votes, but the  future\r\n\r\nwell-being,  prosperity, harmony, national  solidarity\r\n\r\nand unity of seven million Malayans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one million Chinese unfortunately cannot\r\n\r\ndetermine the future of Malaya. Not even three million\r\n\r\nChinese in the Federation can determine the future  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  And  it  is  that future  which  we  have  to\r\n\r\ndetermine - or at least the basis of a solution to  that\r\n\r\nfuture  (the formulation of the Malayan nation has  to\r\n\r\nbe   agreed) - before   we  will  get   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  to agree to acknowledge Nanyang University\r\n\r\nas   a   Malayan  institution  to  which  they   grant\r\n\r\nrecognition, and which they also subsidise.  Otherwise\r\n\r\nlet  us  face  the fact: what Nanyang University  will\r\n\r\nbecome is a Singapore University - and a Chinese one  at\r\n\r\nthat - despite all the efforts to try and colour it, and\r\n\r\ndespite  all the efforts to introduce the teaching  of\r\n\r\nMalay and Indian languages, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, at the back of the minds of the Malay\r\n\r\npeople - the Tunku is a very honest and a very frank man\r\n\r\nwho agreed that the P.A.P. analysis of why there is no\r\n\r\nmerger  is  correct - they want to know what happens  to\r\n\r\nthe  Malay language and the Malay culture in  the  new\r\n\r\nMalayan nation. If theirs is going to be the secondary\r\n\r\nlanguage and the secondary culture in a free and  open\r\n\r\ncompetition of cultures and languages, then there will\r\n\r\nbe  trouble.  Then you will never get  recognition  of\r\n\r\nNanyang   University,   because   Nanyang   University\r\n\r\nrepresents to them the dynamism, drive, and ability of\r\n\r\na  very  powerful culture and of a very  able  people.\r\n\r\nWhen we settle this question of national language, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  basis  upon which the new Malaya is to be  built,\r\n\r\nand  we  satisfy them that the Malay language  is  the\r\n\r\nnational language, then they will not object to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanybody learning their own language and fostering  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of their own culture within the context of\r\n\r\na Malayan society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no university can exist as a good university in\r\n\r\nthe  modern  world without State grants. A  privately-endowed  university which is able  to  carry  out  its\r\n\r\nduties  as a seat and centre of learning and  research\r\n\r\nand  the  quest  for  human knowledge,  is  no  longer\r\n\r\npossible  unless  the  large  expenses  which  a  good\r\n\r\nuniversity must incur in equipment and recurrent costs\r\n\r\nare  met from Government funds. The fact that a  group\r\n\r\nof  Chinese  leaders  have been able  to  get  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity started is a tribute to their determination\r\n\r\nand drive. But I think that they will be the first  to\r\n\r\nacknowledge, now that they have started it,  that  its\r\n\r\nfuture prosperity as a University cannot depend on the\r\n\r\nfluctuations  in  the  rubber  or  tin  trade.  Having\r\n\r\nstarted the University, you cannot put up or cut  down\r\n\r\nyour  fees  and  admit more or less students,  as  the\r\n\r\nprice  of  rubber goes up or comes down, or  the  bank\r\n\r\naccounts  of your rubber brokers go up or  come  down.\r\n\r\nLet  us  face this that in Singapore, so long  as  you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  an  electorate such as it is, it must inevitably\r\n\r\nmean that Nanyang University will be subsidised by the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government and its degrees will  ultimately\r\n\r\nbe recognised by the Singapore Government. There is no\r\n\r\nescape  from  that logical conclusion so long  as  you\r\n\r\nseek  the  answer  in a Singapore context.  Given  the\r\n\r\nfacts  obtaining  in the Singapore election  register,\r\n\r\nthe answer is obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to know the answer to is not\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  in  the context  of  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nsituation, but Nanyang University in the context of  a\r\n\r\nMalayan situation and, more, Nanyang University in the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  a  South-East  Asia  situation.  Let   me\r\n\r\nelaborate. By the curious twists and turns of  British\r\n\r\ncolonial government, Singapore is emerging as a  semi-independent  City in which, as a result  of  the  past\r\n\r\nimmigration  policy  of  the  British  Government   in\r\n\r\nwanting efficient and cheap labour, the power  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the electorate is largely Chinese.  Let  us\r\n\r\nface the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Chinese, including those who have been  here  for\r\n\r\ngenerations, are determined to preserve their language\r\n\r\nand  culture.  If  we deny that,  then  we  are  being\r\n\r\ndishonest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time, this power poses acutely the\r\n\r\nproblems  which the Malay people have  to  face.  They\r\n\r\nhave  not been able to found a Malay university.  They\r\n\r\nhave,  it  is true, a college to teach the  tenets  of\r\n\r\nIslam. It is unlikely that, without State grants, such\r\n\r\nan  institution would ever be found. They  watch  this\r\n\r\ninstitution,  therefore,  with  a  certain  amount  of\r\n\r\napprehension because they would like to know what  the\r\n\r\nultimate   future  holds  for  them.  What   does   it\r\n\r\nsymbolise?  I  believe that the  leader  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. is  quite sincere when he  says  he  is  not\r\n\r\nagainst Nanyang University. He cannot be because he is\r\n\r\nin  a Chinese situation in Singapore, but, at the same\r\n\r\ntime, I would like to admit that I do not believe that\r\n\r\nthis is the answer which the South-East Asia situation\r\n\r\nwould give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethnologically, Singapore stands in the centre of a\r\n\r\nbelt  of  Malay-speaking people, stretching  from  the\r\n\r\nnorth  of  Sumatra right down to the Celebes,  perhaps\r\n\r\nnearly  to the tip of West Irian. There are 80-million\r\n\r\nsuch  people, and one day they are going to put  their\r\n\r\nhouse  in  order.  When that happens,  this  is  their\r\n\r\nregion.  Therefore I say, as a Chinese,  I  would  not\r\n\r\nwait  and  create  problems  which  are  difficult  of\r\n\r\nsolution  later  on, but would resolve these  problems\r\n\r\nnow before they get out of control. It is as simple as\r\n\r\nthis.  60  per  cent  of  the students  are  from  the\r\n\r\nFederation. But the Federation Government is not going\r\n\r\nto  pay one cent in support of Nanyang University,  or\r\n\r\nthe   students,  let  alone  pass  a  statute   openly\r\n\r\nrecognizing  it  as  a  seat of  learning  and  as  an\r\n\r\ninstitution  for  the advancement of human  knowledge,\r\n\r\nuntil  they  are quite sure that it fits in  with  the\r\n\r\nscheme of things which is acceptable to them. And what\r\n\r\nI would like to pose to this Assembly is the long-term\r\n\r\nproblem of finding that basis which is acceptable, not\r\n\r\nonly  to  the Malays in the Federation, but one  which\r\n\r\nwill fit in with the pattern of South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang as a university, where primarily the\r\n\r\nChinese foregather, is not objectionable, and will not\r\n\r\nbe,  provided  it  does  not  pose  a  threat  to  the\r\n\r\nindigenous language and indigenous culture. And if  we\r\n\r\nwant  a  solution, then I say, openly  recognize  this\r\n\r\nfact  today - that  the  basis for  national  unity  and\r\n\r\nsolidarity in Malaya is only possible on the basis  of\r\n\r\na  Malayan  national  language.  When  that  offer  is\r\n\r\nacceptable, then not only accept it, but translate  in\r\n\r\ninto  practice  where your students in Nanyang  pursue\r\n\r\ntheir  studies of Confucius, be it with the imprimatur\r\n\r\nof  the  Communists, or without the imprimatur of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  depending upon whether the textbooks  are\r\n\r\nimported  from the mainland of China or  from  Taiwan.\r\n\r\nThe  time  when  all those students can converse  with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHon, the Dato, who is our Deputy Chief Minister, in  a\r\n\r\nlanguage  which he understands, and perhaps even  with\r\n\r\nmore  erudition if he has had the time to  study  that\r\n\r\nlanguage, is the time when we have struck the basis of\r\n\r\nnational  solidarity.  Nobody minds  it,  provided  he\r\n\r\nknows  that  it is not a language which  is  going  to\r\n\r\nreplace Malay. But so long as he believes that it is a\r\n\r\nlanguage which may well not only claim an equal status\r\n\r\nbut  ultimately claim more than an equal status,  then\r\n\r\nyou will find no solution to the problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Changi today not only pleads his\r\n\r\ncase  but  is able at the same time to demonstrate  to\r\n\r\nthe  Malay people that he can speak Malay as  well  as\r\n\r\neverybody else, or as well as every other Malay,  then\r\n\r\nwe  have a basis for national solidarity; because then\r\n\r\nnobody  will be worried if the Member for Changi  does\r\n\r\nspeak  English which is heavily accentuated  with  the\r\n\r\nTeochew, Mandarin and Cantonese dialects. It  is  only\r\n\r\nwhen  we have settled the base that we can put Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity at the apex of an education pyramid. At the\r\n\r\nmoment  its  base  is  different  from  that  of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  University  of  Malaya has a diversified  Malayan\r\n\r\nbase and, for that reason, although the Tunku and  his\r\n\r\neducation  experts want to try and insulate  Singapore\r\n\r\nstudents - in  case  it is believed that  radicalism  is\r\n\r\nendemic only to Singapore - he acknowledges that  it  is\r\n\r\nthe   stream   from  which  the  administrators,   the\r\n\r\ntechnicians and the technologists who are going to run\r\n\r\nthe  apparatus of State, the organs of government  are\r\n\r\nto come. What is going to happen now, unless we find a\r\n\r\nsolution  quickly,  is  that  hundreds  of  able   and\r\n\r\nenergetic graduates of Nanyang University (60 per cent\r\n\r\nof  whom have come from the Federation) will be unable\r\n\r\nto get jobs in the Federation, and they will therefore\r\n\r\nremain here to seek employment. Therefore, all that we\r\n\r\nare  creating is a more difficult situation to resolve\r\n\r\nas  the population and this group of people expand and\r\n\r\nbecome  more  and more dissatisfied with the  existing\r\n\r\norder.  If, however, an attempt is made now to explore\r\n\r\nthe  possibilities  and  to formulate  the  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions under which Nanyang could become a  Malayan\r\n\r\nuniversity,  and  not  merely a Singapore  university,\r\n\r\nthen we might be able, in the early formative years of\r\n\r\nthe University, to shape and design its policy and  to\r\n\r\nlead  it  along parallel lines with the University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  If we do not do that, then we are  in  for  a\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  time, which will get  more  and  more\r\n\r\ndifficult year by year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we admit that Singapore and the Federation\r\n\r\nare  one  economic unit, as I heard the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and Industry admit, and we do not want  this\r\n\r\none  economic  unit  to be torn  asunder  by  all  the\r\n\r\nstresses and strains of ethnological, linguistic,  and\r\n\r\nother  divisions,  let  us resolve  them  before  they\r\n\r\nbecome  acute.  In  the last and  final  analysis,  we\r\n\r\nsurvive  or  fail according to whether we can  find  a\r\n\r\nsolution  which is not only acceptable to the  Malays,\r\n\r\nbut  also to the Chinese and the Indians. The  Indians\r\n\r\ndo  not  pose the same difficulty because they do  not\r\n\r\npose as a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncounter  culture competing for supremacy. The  Chinese\r\n\r\ndo,  and it does no good not to acknowledge this.  Let\r\n\r\nus openly acknowledge it and find a solution, and when\r\n\r\nwe  find  it, then we have got the basis of a  healthy\r\n\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the easiest thing in the world today is to stir\r\n\r\nup   deep-seated   emotional  prejudices.   When   the\r\n\r\nCeylonese   united  left-wing  group  won   the   last\r\n\r\nelections  on the basis of Singhalese as the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage,  with the aid of Buddhist monks,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  they envisaged that ultimately there  would  be\r\n\r\nmartial law in Ceylon as the Tamils revolted.  In  the\r\n\r\nsame  way,  I do not believe for one moment  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government,  whatever  its  policies   and\r\n\r\ndesire,  can  prevent the continuance of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage as the mother tongue, and one of the media of\r\n\r\ninstruction  of the Chinese in their schools,  unless,\r\n\r\nof  course,  a  bloody revolution is not considered  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent  enough. But at the same time,  a  state  of\r\n\r\ndeadlock  where  one views the other  with  suspicion,\r\n\r\nbecause  one  believes the other wants  ultimately  to\r\n\r\nobtain supreme control over the minds and the, tongues\r\n\r\nof all, must lead to a gradual deterioration of racial\r\n\r\nrelations.   In  Singapore  we  have   a   very   good\r\n\r\nopportunity in a numerically Chinese-dominated city to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate   to  the  Malays,  both  here,   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  in  South-East  Asia,  that  we   are\r\n\r\nprepared to be part of the Malayan scene and  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  South-East  Asian context. The less  we  have  of\r\n\r\nchauvinist  slogans or sentiments whilst discussing  a\r\n\r\nmatter  highly charged with emotion, and  particularly\r\n\r\nChinese  chauvinist slogans, the healthier it  is  for\r\n\r\neveryone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we support this Bill but, at the same time,\r\n\r\nexpress  our regrets that a Malayan solution  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen found to the problems of Nanyang University, both\r\n\r\nas   regards   its  recognition  and   its   financial\r\n\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nglad to see the support given by this House to Nanyang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity. All the support is deserving but the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  of this support is that coming from  UMNO's\r\n\r\nrepresentative. Without the Nanyang University,  where\r\n\r\ncould  the  Chinese  students, having  finished  their\r\n\r\nsecondary education in the Chinese schools, go to?  If\r\n\r\nthey were to go to the Chinese mainland, they would be\r\n\r\ngiven  a one-way ticket from which there would  be  no\r\n\r\nreturn.  If they were to go to Formosa, their  loyalty\r\n\r\nto  Malaya  would be questioned. So Nanyang University\r\n\r\noffers  them  a solution. Hence we have full  support,\r\n\r\nwith students coming not only from Singapore, but also\r\n\r\nfrom the Federation of Malaya to Nanyang University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to have personal contact with the\r\n\r\nstudents,  I  spend  two  hours  every  week  at   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  and I can give my assurance  to  the  non-Chinese communities in Singapore that the students  of\r\n\r\nNanyang University are loyal citizens of Malaya.  They\r\n\r\nwere  proud of their Federation of Malaya citizenship;\r\n\r\nso  they  told me when they came to me. That assurance\r\n\r\nalso  applies to the Nanyang University students  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other assurance I would like to give to\r\n\r\nthis  House,  to  the  whole  of  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, and it is this: that the Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  students  accept  Malay  as  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage of the whole of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future, Sir, can be this. Nanyang University\r\n\r\nmight become one of the colleges of the University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  A  portion  of the University  of  Malaya  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  might  also be known as Singapore  college.\r\n\r\nNanyang  college, Singapore college and  Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollege, might form the University of Malaya in a Pan-Malayan setup. Let there be no fear of the loyalty  of\r\n\r\nthe students of the Nanyang University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad that there will be some provision\r\n\r\nmade  for the Students' Union; that perhaps a building\r\n\r\nwill be given to the students of Nanyang University \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover which they shall have absolute control. I\r\n\r\nremember, when I was in the University of Hongkong  as\r\n\r\nan undergraduate, that the whole building was given to\r\n\r\nthe students and they had absolute control so much  so\r\n\r\nthat they had even the right to exclude any member  of\r\n\r\nthe  teaching staff. We enjoyed that, Sir, and  it  is\r\n\r\nfrom these little things that we have such loyalty  to\r\n\r\nour  alma  mater.  Sir,  in  my  vision,  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  will  be a lighthouse in South-East  Asia.\r\n\r\nMay it be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this. Bill represents a\r\n\r\nnecessary  and  proper  evolutionary  development   in\r\n\r\nSingapore's educational progress, and few  would  wish\r\n\r\nto  do other than welcome it. But as the taxpayer will\r\n\r\nhave to help pay for the running of the University, it\r\n\r\nis  reasonable  that Government should participate  in\r\n\r\nits  administration and guide its deliberations. What\r\n\r\nis  vital,  however,  is that the  academic  standards\r\n\r\nshould  be proper University standards, and  it  is  a\r\n\r\npity  that it has not been able to establish this  yet\r\n\r\nat  this  stage. We hope that the Commission  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  complete  the  work next  year  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible  and  solve a vital problem. We welcome  this\r\n\r\nBill,  and  the  fact that it will go  to  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee for further examination so that if there  is\r\n\r\nstill  any controversy or misunderstanding in  any  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions they can be ironed out.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  has contributed in the past few years  to  a\r\n\r\nbroader-minded   understanding  of   the   issues   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, educational, academic, cultural and social,\r\n\r\ncall them what you will. It is important to bring  the\r\n\r\nNanyang   University  within  the  comity  of  Malayan\r\n\r\neducational  institutions, and we hope that  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  step  towards this end.  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  to  realise that, as the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar has said more eloquently than I  could,\r\n\r\nit is the first step and not the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwelcome  this Bill, and I say that the Malays have  no\r\n\r\nfear  of Nanyang University as a threat to them. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  believe that when we start anything  it  will  be\r\n\r\nperfect.  Rome was not built in a day. Today  we  find\r\n\r\nthat Nanyang University has already started Malay as a\r\n\r\nlanguage,  and I am certain that it will be  developed\r\n\r\nin  such  .a  manner as to make it  one  of  the  very\r\n\r\nimportant subjects in that University. Those  who  are\r\n\r\nsitting  in  control  of that University  are  men  of\r\n\r\nintelligence  and experience, and I  am  certain  that\r\n\r\ntheir guidance will not lead Nanyang astray, but  lead\r\n\r\nit so that it becomes .a pattern in our Malayan scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the University is concerned, Sir, I welcome\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of another institution  for  higher\r\n\r\neducation.  The  addition  of  another  university  to\r\n\r\nMalaya  and Singapore is a blessing for the  whole  of\r\n\r\nMalaya and will give opportunities to a greater number\r\n\r\nof  students  to have a chance of higher  studies.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  as a school teacher, I have found that many  of\r\n\r\nour  students  cannot get places in the University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  and that a large percentage of them has  gone\r\n\r\noverseas  to study, even in English universities.  All\r\n\r\nof  them, or a very high percentage of them, did  well\r\n\r\nand  returned  with  degrees from foreign  lands.  The\r\n\r\ncreation  of  Nanyang University will help  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  no means to travel abroad, and I certainly think\r\n\r\nthat we have to give it the fullest support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years ago, a long time before the war, we did\r\n\r\nnot  hear  of  any university in Malaya.  Anybody  who\r\n\r\nwanted  a  degree must go overseas, coming  back  with\r\n\r\ndegrees  either  from  English universities,  European\r\n\r\nuniversities or American universities. Today, we  find\r\n\r\nthat  we are starting Our own university. I hope  that\r\n\r\nwe  will be able to develop our university so that  it\r\n\r\nwill  not  only serve Malaya and Singapore alone,  but\r\n\r\nwill serve the whole of South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is the focal point for trade and\r\n\r\ncommunications, and I hope that it will  also  be  the\r\n\r\ncentre for learning in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia. This is a land where democracy  still\r\n\r\nrules.  We  all  support  the idea  of  democracy,  we\r\n\r\nsupport this ideal, and if we have students from other\r\n\r\ncountries  around us coming to these  universities  to\r\n\r\nlearn  our ideals, then I think democracy will  thrive\r\n\r\nin the whole of South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous to the opening of Nanyang University, we\r\n\r\nhave  only  the Malayan University meant for  students\r\n\r\nwho  are  educated  in English. Those  who  were  from\r\n\r\nChinese schools were forced to go to China for further\r\n\r\nstudies.  If Nanyang University were not opened,  they\r\n\r\nwould  either  be stranded in Singapore or  Malaya  or\r\n\r\nthey  had  to start their schooling all over again  in\r\n\r\norder to get admission into English universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a fear expressed by the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar that, by creating Nanyang University, we\r\n\r\nare turning out many trained people who will be coming\r\n\r\nout  and yet cannot find employment. I feel that there\r\n\r\nshould be no such fears. Many able people are required\r\n\r\nin commercial firms. I would say that the best talents\r\n\r\nare  absorbed  into  all these institutions.  Business\r\n\r\nmust  progress  and today we find many  of  the  local\r\n\r\nbusinesses   progressing  to  as  high  a   level   of\r\n\r\nefficiency as those of the European communities.  They\r\n\r\nneed  men,  and  they need men who are  trained  in  a\r\n\r\nlanguage   that  will  be  useful  to  them.   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  students know Chinese, and  certainly  our\r\n\r\ntrade  needs this language. If we trade with the  West\r\n\r\nwe  need  English and European languages;  and  if  we\r\n\r\ntrade with the East we need Chinese. We need both  the\r\n\r\nlanguages,  and we need Malay if we are  trading  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  I think from these institutions  you  will\r\n\r\nfind  men  coming out well able to take care  of  this\r\n\r\nneed.  I  am certain that they will not come out  with\r\n\r\nthe  problem of unemployment aggravated, but certainly\r\n\r\nthey  can  be  absorbed into the commercial  firms  or\r\n\r\nGovernment Departments of all territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Minister for Education has pointed out that\r\n\r\nthe   Government  has  come  to  the  aid  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.

So I will add  just  a\r\n\r\nlittle  to  what has been said, and that is,  I  would\r\n\r\nplead  to  the  Government to look after  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity as a second son just as well as it has been\r\n\r\nlooking after its elder son, the University of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should not like\r\n\r\nto  be  the only silent Member in the House when there\r\n\r\nis  unanimous support given to the Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nBill, support which I myself would give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have recently been reading an article by Professor\r\n\r\nLewis, who is an economic expert on the developed  and\r\n\r\nunder-developed  territories, and he, after  examining\r\n\r\nvarious  types  of investment, felt that  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nhighest priority of all was for education, since it is\r\n\r\nthe  educated  who  in  the end could  carry  out  the\r\n\r\nplanning and management which will be necessary for  a\r\n\r\ndetailed  investment of all kinds. For that reason,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that it is right in Singapore that we  should\r\n\r\nhave  been pouring money into the building of  primary\r\n\r\nand  secondary  schools and that we  should  have  two\r\n\r\nuniversities  on  our tiny island, because  from  that\r\n\r\nhigh rate of investment in education, we can hope to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreap a high rate of economic benefit if all goes well.\r\n\r\nWithout   that  high  rate  of  investment - the   basic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestment -  we  should  have much  less  prospect  of\r\n\r\nmastering the problems which undoubtedly face us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Serangoon referred to the great\r\n\r\nimportance  of Nanyang University being  independent,\r\n\r\nfree from outside control and running itself. I am not\r\n\r\ngoing to discuss that in detail, but I would say  that\r\n\r\nI  most fully agree with that principle with regard to\r\n\r\nuniversities. There are always difficulties, because a\r\n\r\nuniversity in the world today, certainly in Singapore,\r\n\r\nhas  not got a free endowment in its own hands. It has\r\n\r\nto  go to one financial source or another for support,\r\n\r\nand  the English have a proverb - he who pays the  piper\r\n\r\ncalls  the  tune. That is a problem which will  always\r\n\r\nrecur in all matters affecting universities. It  is  a\r\n\r\nproblem which must be in the minds of the Assembly and\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hon. Member - I have forgotten who - referred to the\r\n\r\nhope   that  the  Government  would  support   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity and he hoped that the Federation Government\r\n\r\nwould   do  something.  Sir,  this  House  is   almost\r\n\r\nunanimously a Socialist House and I would myself  draw\r\n\r\nno  more  than a practical distinction between private\r\n\r\nfinance and public finance. They are all parts of  the\r\n\r\ntotal national wealth and where the details of control\r\n\r\nlie,  it  is an accident of history and a subject  for\r\n\r\ndiscussion.  But  the  fact  is  that  investment   in\r\n\r\neducation, whether it is private investment or  public\r\n\r\ninvestment, is a national investment and  it  must  be\r\n\r\nconsidered in the light of the national interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have heard a statement from the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation about the leakages in examination questions.\r\n\r\nNobody supposes that leakages in examination questions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  because students had a curiosity about them,  or\r\n\r\nbecause  they had a passionate desire to  score  extra\r\n\r\nmarks because their fathers would he happy to see them\r\n\r\nget more marks. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimple   and  sole  reason  why  examination  question\r\n\r\nleakages   are   liable  to  occur  is   because   the\r\n\r\ncompetition to get up to the highest possible point of\r\n\r\nthe  education  ladder is so very great  and  so  very\r\n\r\nurgent,  and it is such a disaster to fail and  to  be\r\n\r\nthrown off the ladder at whatever point it is - Form IV\r\n\r\nor  Form VI - because the fruits are at the top  of  the\r\n\r\nladder. If you do not get to the top, the fewer fruits\r\n\r\nyou will get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have heard references in speeches this\r\n\r\nafternoon  to  the fact that from our universities  we\r\n\r\ndraw the managerial cadres who go into commerce and go\r\n\r\ninto  the  Government, and go into all the controlling\r\n\r\nactivities  in  Singapore and the Federation - positions\r\n\r\nof  importance,  which people must  have  skills  for,\r\n\r\nskills  which  can only be acquired by  what  we  call\r\n\r\nhigher  education. That is true. It  does  present  us\r\n\r\nwith  a danger which the Socialists must bear in mind.\r\n\r\nThe  danger is the creation of a new managerial  class\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubsidised from public funds. The cost of educating  a\r\n\r\nstudent  at  a university, as it falls on  the  public\r\n\r\npurse,  comes to a few thousand dollars a  year - up  to\r\n\r\n$6,000  or $8,000 a year - and over a series of  years.\r\n\r\nAt  the  end of it all, the student goes out with  his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiploma  in his hand and his degree, and if  he  likes\r\n\r\nto,  he  can  sit back and sell coloured  water  at  a\r\n\r\ndispensary and charge $10 for it. He can have  a  very\r\n\r\nbig car and a nice house and several wives and have  a\r\n\r\nvery happy life to himself. All this has been achieved\r\n\r\nby  a  certain  amount of hard work  by  himself,  but\r\n\r\nessentially because he has been carried by  the  sweat\r\n\r\nand  suffering of the poor and the taxation which they\r\n\r\ncarry  has lifted him up and given him the opportunity\r\n\r\nof  making  a  very  good thing for himself.  That  is\r\n\r\nalways  the  danger which we must bear  in  mind,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps one way in which it can be reduced is to  have\r\n\r\na  very  ample  supply of those who have been  through\r\n\r\nhigher education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. friend and colleague, the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary,  has  pointed to some of the  cost  factors\r\n\r\nwith  regard to our educational problems in his Budget\r\n\r\nspeech,  and  those are going to pose us very  serious\r\n\r\nproblems  in the future. We must accept the fact  that\r\n\r\ninvestment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  education  is vital to the wealth, prosperity  and\r\n\r\nhappiness  of this country, but we must  also  do  all\r\n\r\nthat we possibly can to ensure that investment is wise\r\n\r\nand  fruitful  investment and that it will  serve  the\r\n\r\nneeds and provide benefits for all the people and  not\r\n\r\nfor  any section of the people or for the creation  of\r\n\r\nany new class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  glad  to notice that practically every  Member  of\r\n\r\nthis  House is supporting the Bill.

What worries me is this, Sir: I have noticed  in\r\n\r\nthe  past, especially when elections are coming,  that\r\n\r\nthey have expressed their views just for the mere sake\r\n\r\nof   vote-catching.   In  my   honest   opinion,   the\r\n\r\ncontribution that the Government has made this year to\r\n\r\nNanyang  University is inadequate, and I hope that  if\r\n\r\nthe Government finds that the University requires more\r\n\r\nhelp,  it will give it.

Arising out of that,  it\r\n\r\nhas  sparked off a debate in which, as the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill has just said, almost every Member  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse has taken part. Sir, this morning I thought  the\r\n\r\nBill  was  going to have unanimous support  without  a\r\n\r\nthorough debate - hence the silence that prevailed  just\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Minister  was  about  to  move  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading.  But  as the Minister for Communications  and\r\n\r\nWorks  has  said,  it  appears that  everyone  has  to\r\n\r\nexpress his views and not just give silent support  to\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  I for one would not like to be accused  of\r\n\r\nbeing  a  silent supporter. So I would like to express\r\n\r\nmy support for this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  welcome  it  and at the same time I would  like  to\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Government for bringing up this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much has been said on the Bill that I do not think\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary for me to elaborate on it very much,\r\n\r\nespecially on the merits of Nanyang University and the\r\n\r\nquestion of the national language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar this afternoon expressed\r\n\r\nhis  fear  in  regard  to the position  in  which  the\r\n\r\nstudents  of  Nanyang University will find  themselves\r\n\r\nwhen they pass out. I agree with him on that point. We\r\n\r\ncannot  provide employment for everyone of  them.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar also expressed the view  that\r\n\r\nwe  should not just look at the issue from a Singapore\r\n\r\noutlook. It should be from a Malayan outlook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of educational qualifications, I was\r\n\r\ntold  that  a Commission has been set up to look  into\r\n\r\nthe  possibility  of  recognising  Nanyang  University\r\n\r\ndegrees.  What I am thinking of is this: if  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  prepared to recognise the University's degrees, is\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya prepared to do the same?  We\r\n\r\nare  separated from the Federation of Malaya  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  is  an independent country.  It  does  not\r\n\r\nrecognise  any  of  the laws we make;  neither  do  we\r\n\r\nrecognise any of the laws it makes; but at times we do\r\n\r\nfollow  the  laws  that  it makes,  or  at  least  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is prepared to draft a Bill to follow suit.\r\n\r\nNow if it is the case that 60 per cent of the students\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Nanyang University are from the Federation, can we\r\n\r\nprovide employment for them in Singapore? If not, they\r\n\r\nwill  then have to go back to the Federation,  and  if\r\n\r\nNanyang  University degrees are not recognised  there,\r\n\r\nthen  how  can  they  seek  employment  in  their  own\r\n\r\ncountry?  I  think the most important  issue  that  we\r\n\r\nshould look into is whether Nanyang University degrees\r\n\r\nwill  be  recognised by the Federation of  Malaya  and\r\n\r\ninternationally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Why\r\n\r\nwas  that amount given to Nanyang University?  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid to this House, and I have said publicly - I suppose\r\n\r\nthe   hon.

We\r\n\r\ncould  have given more, but we would have been accused\r\n\r\nof   playing  politics.

Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor's  consent to proceed with this  Bill  and  I\r\n\r\nmove, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that I stated in this House about\r\n\r\ntwo  years  ago that Government was investigating  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  making tax concessions,  more  popularly\r\n\r\nknown  as  tax holidays, to industries whose expansion\r\n\r\nor establishment it was desired to encourage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of territories grant tax holidays to new\r\n\r\nindustries. Sometimes this is done under the  existing\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax  Ordinance and sometimes it is done  under\r\n\r\nspecial  pioneer industry legislation. From  available\r\n\r\ninformation  at  the  present  time,  Ghana,  Nigeria,\r\n\r\nBritish Guiana, Trinidad, and some of the smaller West\r\n\r\nIndian Islands grant tax holidays to industries.  Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  are  of course, aware that the Federation  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaya   has   recently   enacted   pioneer   industry\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided that tax concessions to\r\n\r\nindustries should apply not only to enterprises  of  a\r\n\r\npioneer nature but also to enterprises which undertake\r\n\r\napproved extensions or expansions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  their  present plant. For the sake of convenience,\r\n\r\nthe  Government proposes that this should be  done  by\r\n\r\ntwo  separate Bills, that is, by the Bill  now  before\r\n\r\nthe House and by the Industrial Expansion (Relief from\r\n\r\nIncome Tax) Bill which is next on the Order Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation is a further step forward in\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy of creating conditions which  will\r\n\r\nencourage the establishment of industries here. It  is\r\n\r\nimperative  that  we  should  turn  our  attention  to\r\n\r\nsecondary  industries  to provide  further  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities as it is only too clear that trade alone\r\n\r\nwill not sustain our growing population. Government is\r\n\r\nconfident that with the policy of selective protection\r\n\r\nas  announced  by  me a few months  ago  and  the  tax\r\n\r\nconcession proposals which are before the House today,\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  conditions  will  be  created  for  an\r\n\r\nincreased rate of industrial development resulting  in\r\n\r\nthe  strengthening of our economy and the creation  of\r\n\r\nmore employment opportunities in the industrial field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Bill now before the House is to\r\n\r\nattract  capital both local and foreign to  invest  in\r\n\r\nnew  industries  in  Singapore by  means  of  offering\r\n\r\nfreedom  from income tax for a period of  five  years.\r\n\r\nSuch  tax relief or tax holiday may, however, only  be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenjoyed by an enterprise which has obtained from me  a\r\n\r\nPioneer Certificate for a specific product. This would\r\n\r\nmean  that  the  production of the particular  product\r\n\r\nconcerned  is considered to be of economic benefit  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The tax concession will also be applicable\r\n\r\nto  benefits and dividends paid out by the  enterprise\r\n\r\npossessing a Pioneer Certificate. The criteria  to  be\r\n\r\napplied before an industry could be declared a pioneer\r\n\r\nindustry are, broadly speaking,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that it is in the public interest; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that it is an industry not being carried out in\r\n\r\nSingapore  on an adequate scale and that  there\r\n\r\nis favourable prospect for further development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain,  before  any  enterprise  may  be  declared  as\r\n\r\nproducing a pioneer product, regard will at all  times\r\n\r\nbe  had  to  the  public interest and  sources  within\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill vests in the Minister for Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry the power to declare any industry or  product\r\n\r\nto   be  a  pioneer  industry  or  a  pioneer  product\r\n\r\nrespectively, and if necessary, he has  the  power  to\r\n\r\nprescribe conditions in the order declaring  either  a\r\n\r\npioneer industry or a pioneer product. Before such  an\r\n\r\norder  is  made, however, the Bill provides  for  full\r\n\r\nopportunity  for those affected to object against  the\r\n\r\nmaking  of such an order. Once an order has been  made\r\n\r\naffording  pioneer status to an industry  or  product,\r\n\r\napplications  may  be made to the  Minister  by  firms\r\n\r\nseeking  pioneer enterprise status in respect of  such\r\n\r\npioneer  industry or pioneer product. Every  applicant\r\n\r\nwill be required to furnish particulars of the capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure  incurred or to be incurred,  the  maximum\r\n\r\nproduction capacity, and so on. On the approval of  an\r\n\r\napplication, a Pioneer Certificate will be  issued  to\r\n\r\nthe enterprise concerned. Provisions also exist in the\r\n\r\nBill  for  the  Minister  to  revoke  an  enterprise's\r\n\r\npioneer status if the conditions under which a Pioneer\r\n\r\nCertificate had been granted have not been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, there is in Singapore a body of opinion\r\n\r\nopposed  to the granting of such discretionary  powers\r\n\r\nto a Minister as they consider that misuse can be made\r\n\r\nof  such powers. They would prefer an appointed  Board\r\n\r\nto exercise such powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, however, forget that in a democratic\r\n\r\nparliamentary system it is the Government, through the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministers, that is responsible to the  people\r\n\r\nfor   the  carrying  out  of  Government  policy,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  it  would  be  totally  Inappropriate   for\r\n\r\nimportant discretionary powers which can have a direct\r\n\r\nbearing  on  or  can affect Government policy,  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to a Board which has no responsibility  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as this Bill and the next Bill are concerned,\r\n\r\nthe  effect  is  to  grant  a concession  through  tax\r\n\r\nrelief, and tax collections are very much a Government\r\n\r\nmatter.  Again, these Bills do not give  the  Minister\r\n\r\nany power to take away any rights from anybody - only to\r\n\r\ngrant  a  concession - and  therefore  no  one  can   be\r\n\r\naggrieved in the real sense of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said, the object of the Bill is to encourage  the\r\n\r\ninvestment  of  local  or  foreign  capital   in   new\r\n\r\nindustries.  I  think  this  Bill  should  have   been\r\n\r\nintroduced much earlier. Anyway, I welcome this  Bill,\r\n\r\nbut  I  want to ask the Minister whether he  is  aware\r\n\r\nthat  at  the moment the City Council has made  a  new\r\n\r\nruling  whereby any people wanting to set up factories\r\n\r\nor  housing projects will have to pay 50 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe cost of laying cables and pipes for the supply  of\r\n\r\nelectricity, water and gas. Previously this  cost  was\r\n\r\nborne  by  the  City Council if the company  concerned\r\n\r\ncould prove that they could erect a certain number  of\r\n\r\nhouses or factories. Personally, I would like to  have\r\n\r\nan  answer from the Minister whether such an important\r\n\r\nruling  passed  by the City Council  will  affect  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that\r\n\r\nthis  House genuinely welcomes this Bill but I am also\r\n\r\nsure  that  this  House has genuine  fears  about  the\r\n\r\nsuccess of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem facing us today is not whether to\r\n\r\nhave  tax  holidays  or  that  industries  should   be\r\n\r\nsubsidised.

I am quoting all these\r\n\r\nextracts in support of my motion on the importance  of\r\n\r\ntrade with China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we all know, Singapore's life blood depends\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  its  entrepot  trade. It is essential  to  develop\r\n\r\nstrong   and   friendly  trade  relations   with   all\r\n\r\ncountries,  particularly our neighbour - China.  Because\r\n\r\nof  her  geographical position and her growing ability\r\n\r\nto   produce  a  wide  range  of  products   at   very\r\n\r\ncompetitive  prices, she is becoming  an  increasingly\r\n\r\nimportant   factor  in  our  entrepot   trade.   Trade\r\n\r\nstatistics for the past few years reflect her  growing\r\n\r\nimportance, and I will quote some figures. Exports  to\r\n\r\nChina  increased from a mere $12.9 million in 1954  to\r\n\r\n$74.3  million  in 1957. Imports from China  increased\r\n\r\nfrom  $87.1 million in 1954 to $159.9 million in 1957.\r\n\r\nSir,  these  figures clearly indicate an  increase  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnearly  100  per cent in imports from  China,  and  an\r\n\r\nincrease of 600 per cent in exports to China. There is\r\n\r\ntherefore  no doubt that China has now become  a  very\r\n\r\nserious competitor with other producing countries.  We\r\n\r\nneed to buy cheap goods and it will be much easier for\r\n\r\nus  to  sell  them at a high price. This will  perhaps\r\n\r\nsmooth   down   our  entrepot  trade  a  great   deal,\r\n\r\nespecially  our external trade. This competition  will\r\n\r\nhelp us to procure more business and keep our entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  going smoothly. It will help to lower our  cost\r\n\r\nof living and, in return, raise the standard of living\r\n\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If China were to stop sending us her foodstuffs, such\r\n\r\nas  vegetables, eggs and fruits, particularly  Chinese\r\n\r\nherbs  and medicines which no other country can supply\r\n\r\nin  substituted form, and we were forced  to  purchase\r\n\r\nthem from other countries, I do not know how much more\r\n\r\nwe  would have to pay for them. Assuming that  we  cut\r\n\r\noff  supplies from this particular source. What do  we\r\n\r\ngain?   Nothing,  Sir,  absolutely  nothing.  On   the\r\n\r\ncontrary, our pattern of trade would be disrupted. Our\r\n\r\nvolume  of  external trade would go down, because  our\r\n\r\ncustomers  would  turn to China or  any  other  direct\r\n\r\nsource to get the goods they want. And, of course, our\r\n\r\npeople  here  would  have  to pay  unnecessarily  high\r\n\r\nprices  for the goods they want, and that will add  to\r\n\r\ntheir hardships. But I must emphasise, Sir, that I  do\r\n\r\nnot  for a moment favour the importation of any  goods\r\n\r\nfrom any source if such importation will endanger  our\r\n\r\ninfant  industries. Let us, however, be  rational  and\r\n\r\nimpartial and treat all countries alike. We definitely\r\n\r\ncannot  pinpoint  any one country  and  say  that  its\r\n\r\nexport  of  certain  articles is  detrimental  to  our\r\n\r\neconomy and yet at the same time allow other countries\r\n\r\nto do that very thing. Naturally in the circumstances,\r\n\r\nSir, we would be accused of showing discrimination and\r\n\r\nbeing unfriendly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote two specific examples on this\r\n\r\naspect. First, the banning of certain publications and\r\n\r\ntextiles  from  China.  The  books  were  imported  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with Government regulations and  with  the\r\n\r\nsanction of a censorship board. But now we turn  round\r\n\r\nand tell them that all these books are undesirable and\r\n\r\nshould be totally banned. How are we going to gain  or\r\n\r\nretain  the  confidence of the public? Sir,  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment takes such inexplicable action,  it  easily\r\n\r\ndestroys  the  faith  of  the  public.  How  can   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  convince  the public  that  the  knowledge\r\n\r\ngained from reading such books as the Dream of the Red\r\n\r\nChamber and the Romance of the Three Kingdoms poses  a\r\n\r\nsubversive  threat to our country, when it takes  such\r\n\r\naction? The real danger by taking such action is this:\r\n\r\nthat it will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlead  the  masses into believing that the  banning  of\r\n\r\nsuch  books is part of a campaign launched by  certain\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries which are ready to  crush  down\r\n\r\nChinese  culture  and  economic potentialities.  I  am\r\n\r\nsorry  to say that S.E.AT.O. has an influence on  this\r\n\r\naction to ban books and textiles from China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the second specific example, Sir - the\r\n\r\nbanning  of  Chinese textiles. I will quote  from  the\r\n\r\neditorial  of  the Straits Times of 5th  November.  It\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Up to the end of July piecegoods imported from China\r\n\r\ntotalled approximately $12 million, which is less than\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  vegetable trade and about one-eighth  of\r\n\r\nJapanese textile imports into Malaya.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  it is not sufficient for us to believe that such\r\n\r\na  ban  on  Chinese  textiles is  going  to  help  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  directly.  Let  us  see  what  the  Japanese\r\n\r\ndelegation  to Seattle had to say. It was reported  in\r\n\r\nthe Free Press on 12th November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr H. Ikeda, Japanese Minister of State, said in\r\n\r\nSeattle yesterday:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We cannot sit back and let the less developed\r\n\r\ncountries in South-East Asia be influenced and  swayed\r\n\r\nby the intensified economic drive of Communist China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that purpose, free nations, especially the United\r\n\r\nStates  and  Japan, must work together  to  give  more\r\n\r\nvigorous  and  well-organised economic  assistance  to\r\n\r\nthese countries.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we read about the Russians starting to dump\r\n\r\ntheir  tin and the Japanese openly saying, \"No, sorry,\r\n\r\nwe  do not buy Malayan tin. We can get some cheap  tin\r\n\r\nfrom   somewhere  else.\"  Sir,  whatever  action   the\r\n\r\nGovernment takes, is it merely to respond to the  call\r\n\r\nand wishes of the Japanese? Or is it an obligation  on\r\n\r\nour  part? Is it the responsibility of this Government\r\n\r\nto  antagonise our no less powerful neighbour,  China?\r\n\r\nSir,  not  for  a moment do I think the Government  is\r\n\r\nthat. I cannot imagine it is, because the Japanese are\r\n\r\nalready backed by the American capitalists. Any person\r\n\r\nwho has ever paid the slightest attention to our trade\r\n\r\nrelations with China will agree that the time has  now\r\n\r\ncome - and it is a crucial moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am even more unhappy about the political\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the banning of Chinese  goods.  In\r\n\r\nfact, by being the only country discriminated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst,  that  can  be construed  unmistakably  as  a\r\n\r\nhostile  attitude  towards her. We have  to  face  the\r\n\r\nfact,  whether we like it or not, that  Red  China  is\r\n\r\nhere  to  stay; that her power, with her  600  million\r\n\r\npeople behind her, cannot be totally ignored. It is in\r\n\r\nour interest to adopt a policy of treating all nations\r\n\r\nalike  and  to live harmoniously with our  neighbours,\r\n\r\nfor  we are a small country and our livelihood depends\r\n\r\non our entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to warn the House that we are now facing\r\n\r\na  most dangerous state of affairs - the danger of being\r\n\r\ndragged  into  the cold war between the East  and  the\r\n\r\nWest,  between the Russians and the Americans. We  may\r\n\r\nbe in danger of losing the valuable independence which\r\n\r\nwe have been striving for, for so long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the present separation of\r\n\r\nMalaya and Singapore is absolutely artificial, because\r\n\r\ngeographically, culturally and economically Malaya and\r\n\r\nSingapore consist of one unit. Although the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are crying out loudly to the skies  that  we\r\n\r\nmust  all  strive  for ultimate unification  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, there is silence from the  other\r\n\r\nside  of  the Causeway. As long as we remain separate,\r\n\r\nwe  have to find a solution to our problem of a merger\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation. We cannot  just  be  blind  and\r\n\r\nobediently follow what the Federation tells us, unless\r\n\r\nSingapore's  interests  are well  looked  after,  well\r\n\r\nconsidered and well protected by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now quote from the statement made by the\r\n\r\nHon. the Minister for Commerce and Industry to this House on 13th August, 1958:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"After careful consideration Government has come to\r\n\r\nthe  conclusion that the principle of protection  must\r\n\r\nbe  recognised for our industries and Government  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  commence taking immediately all such  steps\r\n\r\nas  are  necessary for this policy to be  implemented.\r\n\r\nGovernment recognises that entrepot trade will  always\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue  to play a major part in our economy  and  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  determined that the operation of protection\r\n\r\nshould be carried out with the minimum possible damage\r\n\r\nto, or dislocation of, the entrepot trade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at what the Minister has done since then.\r\n\r\nHe  has banned books and textiles from China. When you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nask  him  to look after the entrepot trade,  he  says,\r\n\r\n\"No,   we  must  look  after  the  interests  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation's industrial projects.\" And when we ask him\r\n\r\nto  look after our local industry, he replies, \"No, we\r\n\r\nmust look after our entrepot trade status.\" Sir, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know when the Minister can decide how he is going\r\n\r\nto  find  a  wonderful solution. On the one  hand,  he\r\n\r\nwants  to  maintain the entrepot status  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand,  on  the  other hand, he wants to carry  out  his\r\n\r\npolicy of industrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have been asked by the Federation to protect a\r\n\r\nsingle textiles mill - the Malayan Textile Mills Ltd. If\r\n\r\nI am not wrong, it was first established in Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir, as we know, the Malayan Textile Mills, until this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  moment,  is  still unable  to  supply  our  home\r\n\r\nmarket.  How  can it supply sufficient  quantities  to\r\n\r\nfeed  our entrepot stomach? Therefore, I wish  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  this. Are we maintaining  the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade,  or are we protecting the interests of industry\r\n\r\nby  this action? I say no, we are not doing either one\r\n\r\nof  them,  because  this  Government  is  giving  more\r\n\r\nimportance  to  protecting the  Federation's  industry\r\n\r\nthan   to  maintain  our  entrepot  trade;  and,  more\r\n\r\nimportant,   it  is  more  concerned   to   keep   the\r\n\r\nFederation's   factories   running   than   to   solve\r\n\r\nSingapore's growing unemployment problem. I  must,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, make it clear, especially after the row I  had\r\n\r\nwith  the  Minister  for Local Government,  Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing, that I am not suggesting for one moment  that\r\n\r\nwe  must  not have the interests of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  at  heart.  I  just want  to  plead  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation   should   also  look   after   Singapore's\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I  have\r\n\r\ntried  to  avoid as far as possible commenting  on\r\n\r\nthe  present political activities in spite of  the\r\n\r\nharmful  effect  they have on  Singapore's  future\r\n\r\ndevelopment. I do not wish to widen  the  gap  and\r\n\r\nincrease   the   misunderstanding   between    the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  Singapore, but I  must  warn  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government,  in  the  gravest  possible\r\n\r\nterms,  that  any  attempt by  it  to  follow  the\r\n\r\nFederation's example in banning the Bank of  China\r\n\r\nwould have serious and harmful repercussions of  a\r\n\r\npermanent nature. I want the Government to  assure\r\n\r\nus  that it is not going to follow the example  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation in banning the Bank of China. Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot afford to ignore the role that the Bank\r\n\r\nof  China  has  been playing. It is financing  our\r\n\r\nlocal industries and important business houses  to\r\n\r\na  great extent, and it is only natural to let the\r\n\r\ntrade with China be done through this Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I call upon the Government to answer some\r\n\r\nquestions.  First,  is it not wise  to  extend  an\r\n\r\nofficial invitation to Red China to send  a  trade\r\n\r\ndelegation   here  in  order  to  clear   up   any\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding and to heal the wounds that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  caused?  Since we are a British  colony  and\r\n\r\nsince  Britain herself has normal trade  relations\r\n\r\nwith  Red  China, I do not think there is anything\r\n\r\nwrong in doing so. It only needs a little courage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Tunku Abdul Rahman is one of the few\r\n\r\nnational leaders who win wide support. The  people\r\n\r\nnot  only of Singapore and the Federation but also\r\n\r\nin Borneo regard him as the only person\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho   is   eligible  to  be  addressed  as  \"Bapak\r\n\r\nMerdeka\",, and he is \"Bapak Merdeka\" not  only  to\r\n\r\nMalaya  but  to Singapore and Borneo as  well.  We\r\n\r\nhave  full confidence that he will be prepared  to\r\n\r\nreconsider  the measures that have been  taken  by\r\n\r\nthe Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There is now less confidence in merger.\r\n\r\nSingapore's    entrepot    trade    status     and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustrialisation are seriously  threatened  by  a\r\n\r\nseries  of trade measures taken against us by  the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) There is the fear of racial discrimination.\r\n\r\nThere  is also the ban on textiles and books  from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChina  and  this is considered by  the  people  as\r\n\r\nbeing part of the move organised by S.E.A.T.O. to\r\n\r\nmislead  the people as being anti-Chinese  culture\r\n\r\nand anti-Chinese economic potentialities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Furthermore, there is the fear of being\r\n\r\ndragged  into the cold war. As we know, the  Tunku\r\n\r\nhas  taken the stand of not joining S.E.A.T.O. and\r\n\r\nit is sufficient that we also should not join this\r\n\r\nOrganisation and be involved in the cold war.  But\r\n\r\nnow, it seems the picture has changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, let me repeat what I have\r\n\r\nsaid  to  both  the Russians and Americans  alike.\r\n\r\nHands  off  Asia!
