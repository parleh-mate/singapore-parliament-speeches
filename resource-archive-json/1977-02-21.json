H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave the dubious honour of bridging the years of  the\r\n\r\nDragon and the Snake. Fortunately, being a Dragon.  I\r\n\r\nhave no reason to be afraid of Snakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we last adjourned I was speaking about the\r\n\r\neconomic  difficulties in the advanced countries.  To\r\n\r\nrecapitulate  briefly, there seems to  be  a  slowing\r\n\r\ndown  of  technological innovations  which  fuel  the\r\n\r\nengine  of  economic  growth.  Secondly,  the   aging\r\n\r\npopulation structure in the industrial countries  has\r\n\r\naltered  the pattern of demand, necessitating  rather\r\n\r\npainful and difficult changes in production patterns.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there is the energy crisis which will  bring\r\n\r\nabout  escalating costs of energy resulting in  lower\r\n\r\nstandards of living and contributing to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninflation.  I might add two other important  factors.\r\n\r\nOne was raised by the President in his Address and by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister's Addendum. This refers  to  the\r\n\r\nexcessive  cushioning of life by state  subsidies  to\r\n\r\nthe  point  where incentives for work and  enterprise\r\n\r\nare seriously eroded, with disastrous consequences in\r\n\r\nterms   of   unemployment,  inflation   and   falling\r\n\r\nstandards of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth factor contributing to the economic\r\n\r\nmalaise of the industrial countries is that of  over-education,  referred to by the hon.  Member  for  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan.  Over  half  the 18-year  old  males  in  the\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries are receiving college  education.\r\n\r\nAnd college graduates usually look for administrative\r\n\r\nand  managerial jobs. Rapid economic growth up to the\r\n\r\nend  of the sixties brought the job opportunities and\r\n\r\nthe  incentives for higher education. But the era  of\r\n\r\nrapid  growth is over unless new cheap energy sources\r\n\r\nare    discovered.   Consequently,   executives   and\r\n\r\nmanagerial positions are difficult to come by. At the\r\n\r\nsame   time,  blue-collar  jobs  go  a-begging.  This\r\n\r\nnaturally  creates further problems of adjustment  in\r\n\r\nthe industrial countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lessons for us are painfully clear. Our\r\n\r\neducational   system  must  be  geared  to   economic\r\n\r\nrealities. In an era of sluggish economic growth,  we\r\n\r\nshall  only  be  creating  more  frustrations  if  we\r\n\r\nproduce graduates for whom few jobs are available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, President Carter has announced a fiscal\r\n\r\nstimulation   package   of  US$31   billion   to   be\r\n\r\nimplemented over two years. At the same time,  he  is\r\n\r\nurging the Japanese and the West Germans to stimulate\r\n\r\ntheir  economies  simultaneously. Unfortunately,  the\r\n\r\nsevere winter in America has disrupted production and\r\n\r\nincreased  fuel bills, thereby diluting the  economic\r\n\r\nstimulus  of the tax cut. Moreover, in my  view,  the\r\n\r\nfiscal measures will stimulate more consumption  than\r\n\r\ninvestment.  Hon.  Members may  know  that  Keynesian\r\n\r\neconomists  believe that a tax cut  and/or  increased\r\n\r\ngovernment   expenditure  will  produce  growth   and\r\n\r\nemployment. A tax cut,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor   example,   makes   more  money   available   to\r\n\r\nindividuals  who will spend some of it and  save  the\r\n\r\nrest.  Their spending will stimulate more production,\r\n\r\nboth  directly and via a multiplier effect. Factories\r\n\r\ntherefore can utilize more of their capacity  and  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time  employ more people. Those  factories\r\n\r\noperating  at  full  capacity are  supposed  to  have\r\n\r\nincentive   for  expanding  their  operations,   thus\r\n\r\nproviding  more  jobs.  But  I  do  not  believe   in\r\n\r\nKeynesian  economics. The main stimulus to investment\r\n\r\ncomes  from technological innovations which  open  up\r\n\r\nnew    frontiers    of   profitable    opportunities.\r\n\r\nInvestments  in  these new areas  in  turn  stimulate\r\n\r\ninvestments in the established industries through the\r\n\r\ninput-output relationship where one factory buys  its\r\n\r\nrequirements from other factories and in  turn  sells\r\n\r\nto others. Unfortunately we know too little about the\r\n\r\nprocesses    of    technological   innovations    and\r\n\r\ngovernments  of the advanced countries have  not  yet\r\n\r\nidentified  this to be a priority area of  attention.\r\n\r\nConsequently,  I expect that, while growth  rates  in\r\n\r\nthe  industrial countries can be marginally improved,\r\n\r\nunemployment and inflation will continue to be severe\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems in store for us are threefold. First of\r\n\r\nall,  it will be harder for us to attract new foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments   as  unemployment  conditions   in   the\r\n\r\nadvanced   countries  will  deter  capital   outflow,\r\n\r\nwitnessed already by the vast volume of literature on\r\n\r\nmultinational    corporations,    especially    those\r\n\r\nemanating  from  the  trade unions  in  the  advanced\r\n\r\ncountries  where they are very much against  the  so-called  export  of jobs and technology to  developing\r\n\r\ncountries  while  we  can  expect  the  pressures  to\r\n\r\nincrease. Secondly, we may find it more difficult  to\r\n\r\nexport our goods if industrial countries raise  their\r\n\r\ntrade  barriers  to  protect  their  own  employment.\r\n\r\nAlready  we  have seen the imposition of barriers  by\r\n\r\nthe   European   Common  Market  on  our   electronic\r\n\r\ncalculators. This is a harbinger of things  to  come.\r\n\r\nThirdly, higher   energy   costs    mean    higher\r\n\r\ntransportation  costs. Our imports  and  our  exports\r\n\r\nincur  transportation  charges.  Therefore,  for  all\r\n\r\nthree  reasons, we  must expect to  work  harder  to\r\n\r\nmaintain and, if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossible, to improve our standards of living.  Either\r\n\r\nwe   take   the   question  of  raising  productivity\r\n\r\nseriously  and  urgently or we may find  unemployment\r\n\r\nand erosion in our standards of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the imperative of raising\r\n\r\nproductivity  we  need  greater  efforts  in   export\r\n\r\npromotion.  Export  financing is being  provided  but\r\n\r\nother  areas  like  marketing,  product  development,\r\n\r\nadvertising and more importantly, after-sales service\r\n\r\nshould  be carefully studied. Further diversification\r\n\r\ninto  new  markets  like West Asia and  expansion  of\r\n\r\nmarkets in the ASEAN region will be helpful to reduce\r\n\r\nour  vulnerability. However, we can only maintain our\r\n\r\ncompetitive  edge by producing products and  services\r\n\r\nof high quality at low cost and with the proper after-sales  service. But if our manufacturers have only  a\r\n\r\nvery  limited time horizon and are interested in one-shot  deals  and one-shot sales, then of course  they\r\n\r\nwill  continue to market goods which are inferior  in\r\n\r\nquality  and  will  not  bother  to  look  after  the\r\n\r\nconsumers once they have sold their products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage greater investment in manufacturing we\r\n\r\nshould  examine  the  incentives  for  expansion  and\r\n\r\ndiversification of existing industries. Since we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  find it harder to attract new  industries,\r\n\r\nthis  seems  to  be  a logical thing  to  look  into.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  we  need  to  examine  what  additional\r\n\r\ntechnical   and   supporting  facilities   Government\r\n\r\nagencies  can offer to stimulate private development,\r\n\r\nespecially in those areas of industry where they find\r\n\r\nit  very  expensive  to buy and  maintain  their  own\r\n\r\ntesting equipment and calibration equipment.  But  if\r\n\r\nsuch  equipment can be provided by Government it will\r\n\r\ncertainly help to stimulate such industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance emphasized further\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  manufacturing  but  perhaps  in  the\r\n\r\nprotectionist  era  that we are entering,  we  should\r\n\r\nexamine  the feasibility of developing other  service\r\n\r\nindustries  to  ensure  reasonable  growth  and  full\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Ministries usually inform this\r\n\r\nHouse of new programmes but we hear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo  little by way of progress reports and  objective\r\n\r\nevaluation  of  the  success  or  failure   of   such\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  for  the  Annual  Reports  submitted  by\r\n\r\nMinistries and Statutory Boards are not of much  help\r\n\r\nas  they  usually  present glowing accounts  and  not\r\n\r\ncritical  analyses of work done by their agencies.  I\r\n\r\nsubmit  that what we need is more critical monitoring\r\n\r\nof what goes on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the President in his\r\n\r\npolicy  speech  delivered  at  the  opening  of  this\r\n\r\nParliament said that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Government has the highest number of votes.\r\n\r\nThis    vote   of   confidence   imposes   a    heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibility  on  my Ministers to  act  fairly  but\r\n\r\nfirmly. My Government will exercise its authority  to\r\n\r\ngovern with circumspection and moderation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple message has alleviated the fears of the\r\n\r\npeople,  because  during the General  Elections  they\r\n\r\nheard  a lot of empty promises made by the Opposition\r\n\r\nparties and a lot of criticisms have been levelled at\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Action Party. Yet the  electorate  was\r\n\r\nintelligent enough to decide to support the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party.  However, there are  some  people  who\r\n\r\nworry  about  the eventuality that once  the  PAP  is\r\n\r\nelected  with full backing of the voters and  with  a\r\n\r\nhigher  percentage of votes this might result in  the\r\n\r\nPAP  Government  being complacent and will  therefore\r\n\r\nneglect the wishes, and needs of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from the policy speech delivered by the\r\n\r\nPresident,  it is clear that the PAP Government  will\r\n\r\nstrive for excellence and will not be complacent over\r\n\r\nits  achievements, nor will it abandon or neglect the\r\n\r\npeople. The President also gave a piece of advice  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government that the authority of the  Government\r\n\r\nderives from the people and the Government should  be\r\n\r\nconcerned with the people's welfare and interests and\r\n\r\nthat  in exercising its power it should see that  the\r\n\r\npeople's  interests are placed above  all  else.  The\r\n\r\ngreater  the  support  given to the  Government,  the\r\n\r\ngreater will be the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Government. Therefore,  whether\r\n\r\nthey be Ministers or Members of Parliament are in the\r\n\r\nservice  of  the Government, they must set  the  good\r\n\r\nexample  of  doing their best and in utilising  their\r\n\r\ntalent  and  attributes  to  carry  out  Government's\r\n\r\npolicies,  they  should  always  be  mindful  of  the\r\n\r\ninterests  and wishes of the people. They should  try\r\n\r\nto  understand  the difficulties  and  needs  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. A Minister should not only be concerned  with\r\n\r\nhis  own Ministry or Constituency but should also  be\r\n\r\nconcerned  with the well being of all the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As  soon as any anomaly or aberration  is\r\n\r\ndiscovered,  he  must  see that  the  civil  servants\r\n\r\nrectify it as soon as possible. For the sake  of  the\r\n\r\nnation  and  the  people,  the  Ministers  must   not\r\n\r\nhesitate to admit their errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a Member representing the\r\n\r\nrural  areas.  It is therefore my duty to  voice  the\r\n\r\nopinions,  the problems and the needs  of  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople. In the last few years the people in the rural\r\n\r\nareas  faced various problems. Their needs also  have\r\n\r\nto  be satisfied. Our country is a rapidly developing\r\n\r\none, attaching great importance to major problems  of\r\n\r\nimprovement  and  development. This has  resulted  in\r\n\r\nneglecting  the problems in the rural  areas  or  its\r\n\r\nimportance lessened. A lot of problems in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  have  therefore been shelved resulting  in  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  number  of  problems  rather  than\r\n\r\nreducing  it  because  of the need  for  development.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  when  Members of Parliament  representing\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas raise the same problems and  needs,\r\n\r\nthey  are  regarded  as being conservative  in  their\r\n\r\nthinking.  This is because the problems in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  have not been solved, and not because the  MPs\r\n\r\nare stubborn and conservative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last few years, there were\r\n\r\ndevelopments  and  modernisation  in  many   spheres.\r\n\r\nAccording  to my observation, there must  be  special\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes to institute modern  amenities\r\n\r\nin   the   rural  areas  to  compensate   for   their\r\n\r\nbackwardness and to bridge the gap between the  urban\r\n\r\nareas and the rural areas. The Government should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsider  the early implementation of this scheme.  I\r\n\r\nfeel that in order to effectively tackle the problems\r\n\r\nof  the rural areas a Rural Affairs Bureau should  be\r\n\r\nset  up  by  the  Government  to  help  tackle  their\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to say that in the\r\n\r\nvarious  Addenda  there  is no  mention  of  any  new\r\n\r\nprogrammes  or  any  projects for  the  provision  of\r\n\r\nmodern amenities for the rural areas. Our rural areas\r\n\r\nare   still  quite  extensive  and  quite   a   large\r\n\r\nproportion of our population live in the rural areas.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is the duty of the Government to do something\r\n\r\nfor the people in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some suggestions to make for the\r\n\r\nconsideration  of  the Government.  Firstly,  in  the\r\n\r\nfield  of  education, schools in the rural areas  are\r\n\r\nvery  small and poorly equipped. The teaching of  the\r\n\r\nsecond  language cannot reach the required  standard.\r\n\r\nIf  this situation is not rectified, then the  pupils\r\n\r\nfrom  the  rural schools who receive unequal training\r\n\r\nwill not be able to compete fairly with children from\r\n\r\nthe urban schools in future. Why does the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  not  consider this and try to  solve  this\r\n\r\nproblem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is the problem of public transport.\r\n\r\nMost  of the rural people live in areas quite removed\r\n\r\nfrom  the major roads, some three or four miles away.\r\n\r\nThey do not possess their own transport. They are  in\r\n\r\ndire  need of public transport service in their daily\r\n\r\ntravel. If we approach this question fairly, we  will\r\n\r\nsee  that the rural people have the greatest need for\r\n\r\na  public transport service. However, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunications has not done anything about it. Why is\r\n\r\nthis so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the field of public construction, most\r\n\r\nof  the  rural  people are engaged in farming  for  a\r\n\r\nlivelihood. They have to carry their farm produce  to\r\n\r\nthe city and elsewhere and bring back fertilisers and\r\n\r\nother  supplies. They are therefore in pressing  need\r\n\r\nof  good  public roads to facilitate their  transport\r\n\r\nneeds.  With good roads, they will be able  to  raise\r\n\r\nthe price of their produce and reduce their cost.  As\r\n\r\nit  is  the  maintenance of roads in the rural  areas\r\n\r\ndepends only on the very meagre annual allocation  of\r\n\r\nfunds by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUrban  and Rural Services Committee. If the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof National Development does not amend the scheme,  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask  when  will  road  construction  works  be\r\n\r\ncompleted in the rural areas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, primary production. Many farmers in the\r\n\r\nRepublic  have been affected by resettlement schemes.\r\n\r\nThey  are  asked to leave their farm land  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment intends to develop. But the Government has\r\n\r\nnot  been able to help them in a satisfactory way and\r\n\r\nso  they have to give up their farming activities  in\r\n\r\nwhich  they  are good at in search of  new  means  of\r\n\r\nlivelihood. No doubt, the Government has allocated  a\r\n\r\npiece  of  land in the Punggol area for pig  rearing,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  to be operated on a large scale.  Small-scale farmers would not therefore have any chance  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the pig-rearing enterprise. Thus, they\r\n\r\nhave to give up and look for other outlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to vegetable farmers, the Government has\r\n\r\nnot  been able to give them alternative land, and  so\r\n\r\nthey  are forced to give up their farming occupation.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  in  my  Constituency, many  vegetable\r\n\r\ngardeners  have  been asked to leave.  They  will  be\r\n\r\nevicted  and they are worried about their  future.  I\r\n\r\nfeel that vegetable gardeners have contributed a  lot\r\n\r\nto  the food supplies of our people. The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development should help them and give  them\r\n\r\nalternative land so that they can continue with their\r\n\r\nusual  vegetable gardening. I am sorry to  note  that\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of National Development does not seem to\r\n\r\nthink so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, on the relationship between the civil\r\n\r\nservants  and the rural people. Rural people  lack  a\r\n\r\nknowledge  of Government administration or the  setup\r\n\r\nof  Government Departments. They are straightforward.\r\n\r\nhonest, practical and pragmatic. Therefore, they  are\r\n\r\nquite   ignorant  of  and  worried  about  Government\r\n\r\nprocesses  and the notices which are given  to  them.\r\n\r\nThey are at a loss over these matters. Civil servants\r\n\r\nalso  lack an understanding of the rural people. They\r\n\r\ndo things by the rule and they follow instructions to\r\n\r\nthe letter. Therefore, there exist a lot of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  and  dissatisfaction  between   the\r\n\r\nrural  people  and certain civil servants.  In  fact,\r\n\r\ncivil servants should exercise certain flexibility in\r\n\r\nimplementing Government policies or measures so as to\r\n\r\nachieve  greater  effectiveness.  According   to   my\r\n\r\nobservation   over  the  years,  in  their   official\r\n\r\ndealings  with the people in the rural  areas,  civil\r\n\r\nservants have been very rigid in their attitude, very\r\n\r\nlacking  in  humane sentiment. Therefore,  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople find it difficult to take and are disappointed\r\n\r\nwith  the Government. The crux of the problem is that\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants  lack an  understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems of rural areas and special training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the problems which I have mentioned\r\n\r\nabove have not been satisfactorily solved for a  long\r\n\r\ntime  neither  has there been a systematic  plan  for\r\n\r\nsolution.  I  feel that this is because  the  various\r\n\r\nMinistries are busy with their own important business\r\n\r\nand  therefore neglecting the minor problems  of  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas. I therefore feel that if the Government\r\n\r\ncan  establish a special department to  give  special\r\n\r\nassistance  to  the various departments  in  tackling\r\n\r\nrural problems, greater achievement will te obtained.\r\n\r\nSir, I support the motion thanking the President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Song):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support the motion thanking the President for\r\n\r\nthe speech he delivered on 8th February on behalf  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government. It was an excellent speech with  the\r\n\r\nmessage  loud and clear; an instructive address  with\r\n\r\nlots  of  punch and purpose, caution and exhortation.\r\n\r\nAptly.  Singaporeans expected no less. This is  after\r\n\r\nall  a  no-nonsense  political  leadership  that  has\r\n\r\nenjoyed and continues to enjoy the fullest confidence\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the President's Address and the\r\n\r\nvarious  Addenda. I must confess that  I  found  very\r\n\r\nlittle  to quarrel with. The plan of action  for  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries for the next five years takes  us\r\n\r\nfurther on the road of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnation-building to make Singapore a more just  and  a\r\n\r\nmore  equal  society. I have no doubts that,  barring\r\n\r\ndevelopments beyond our control, we shall succeed  if\r\n\r\nwe  continue  as a nation to show grit,  stamina  and\r\n\r\nhard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Prime Minister's Office\r\n\r\nemphasised  the  philosophy of the  Government:  that\r\n\r\nrewards must be correlated with work, that excellence\r\n\r\nshould be rewarded and honoured in order that all can\r\n\r\nbenefit from the exceptional talents of the few, that\r\n\r\nthe  talented few should not be punished  to  satisfy\r\n\r\nthe doctrinal follies of the even fewer. We hold true\r\n\r\nthe  traditional Asian precept, \"From each his  best,\r\n\r\nto  each  his worth\". It follows therefore  that  any\r\n\r\nflirtation with unrealistic doctrines is an  exercise\r\n\r\nto kill human motivation and genius. At the same time\r\n\r\nthe  Government  declared that it commits  itself  to\r\n\r\nhelp the needy through better education and health so\r\n\r\nthat  all  men  and  women are equal  in  health  and\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our philosophy reflects a deep understanding of the\r\n\r\nhuman nature, the id and the ego. We seek to motivate\r\n\r\nman  to  better himself to work hard,  to  reach  for\r\n\r\nexcellence in return for what he is worth, We see  no\r\n\r\nvirtue in dogma or doctrinaire politics, and we  find\r\n\r\nthe  heavy-handed  practice  in  some  countries   to\r\n\r\nmethodically    destroy   man   and   his    familiar\r\n\r\nsurroundings  to recreate a new man, an  unacceptable\r\n\r\nand unnecessarily expensive exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP, I am sure, shall continue to govern with\r\n\r\ncircumspection and moderation, to jealously guard our\r\n\r\nnational  interests,  to reject unhealthy  influences\r\n\r\nthat do us no good. To progress and to move ahead  we\r\n\r\nmust  continue to selectively imbibe relevant factors\r\n\r\nof  other societies, Western, Japanese or Chinese and\r\n\r\n\"incorporate  these factors into our  system  without\r\n\r\ndamage to ourselves\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note with great interest the amount of debate and\r\n\r\ndiscussion  the President's address has generated  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  over the last week. I am also  extremely\r\n\r\nencouraged  by the favourable response of the  public\r\n\r\nto this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst  session  of the fourth Parliament.

As  one  of\r\n\r\nmany    nations    with   constitutionally    elected\r\n\r\ngovernments, Singapore is unique in having  a  first-rate  Government but an appalling collection of  non-viable  opposition  parties outside  Parliament  that\r\n\r\nwake  up every fifth year. The real opposition walked\r\n\r\nout  of  this House in 1963 and took to the  streets.\r\n\r\nAnd  lest  they  be forgotten, we are constantly  and\r\n\r\npainstakingly  reminded  that  they  are  very   much\r\n\r\naround. And indeed they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAP Backbenchers are now expected to assume the role\r\n\r\nof the Parliamentary opposition: to debate issues, to\r\n\r\nair\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\ngrievances, to check and balance government action or\r\n\r\ninaction, to provide the forum for the government  to\r\n\r\nexplain and justify its policies and implementations.\r\n\r\nThis,  of course, presupposes that Ministers will  co\r\n\r\noperate  in the right spirit: to invite comments,  to\r\n\r\naccept criticisms, to concede when necessary and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  to  take praise graciously where  credit  is\r\n\r\ndue.  The intention here should not be for one  party\r\n\r\nto score points over the other, but to complement the\r\n\r\nfunctions of each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, let conscience be our guide. The task ahead is\r\n\r\nnot  exactly  an easy one, and it is not likely  that\r\n\r\nall  MPs  can  fulfil  this  role  successfully.  The\r\n\r\noutspoken  Backbencher  will  certainly  not  win   a\r\n\r\npopularity  poll  amongst Ministers and,  conversely,\r\n\r\nthe  aggressive,  short-tempered,  arrogant  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  find  himself  sipping  coffee  alone  in   the\r\n\r\nMembers' Room next door. The challenge, as I see  it,\r\n\r\nis  to  develop  the art of Minister-bashing  without\r\n\r\ntears  and to do it in such a way that Ministers  ask\r\n\r\nfor more of the same!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gone to some length on this subject because I\r\n\r\nfeel  that this is an extremely important matter that\r\n\r\ndemands  the  attention of all. I salute the  leaders\r\n\r\nwho  call  for  greater debate so that different  and\r\n\r\nindeed divergent views can contend. I think it  would\r\n\r\nbe  suicidal  for the PAP and for this Government  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  think that Singaporeans  would  readily\r\n\r\naccept  as gospel truth without question, any  action\r\n\r\nor policy of the Government, however well-intentioned\r\n\r\nit  may be; and that every five years the same  party\r\n\r\nwould be returned full-house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore prospers, as more and more people are\r\n\r\neducated  with  increasing  political  awareness  and\r\n\r\nsophistication,  and as the basic  needs  like  food,\r\n\r\nshelter,  jobs  and education are  attended  to,  the\r\n\r\nbattle  for  people's hearts and  allegiance  is  won\r\n\r\nthrough   the   minds;  using   reason,   logic   and\r\n\r\npersuasion.  In  the  words  of  Shakespeare,   \"Your\r\n\r\ngentleness  will move me more than force move  me  to\r\n\r\ngentleness\".  It  shall,  I  feel,  better   insulate\r\n\r\nSingapore against attempts to subvert government  and\r\n\r\npeople  and  I  think this new approach  would  be  a\r\n\r\nbetter bet than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  political opportunists or gamblers come to  power\r\n\r\nby default.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have good reasons to believe that the call for\r\n\r\ngreater  parliamentary debate is sincere,  and  well-intentioned. It is timely and it is necessary too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, therefore suggest that these same leaders now\r\n\r\ncall  for  debate  to be extended outside  Parliament\r\n\r\nwith  similar exhortations. This is a logical sequel.\r\n\r\nWe  must surely agree that there is a near total lack\r\n\r\nof  public  debate.  People  fight  shy  of  uttering\r\n\r\nopinions,  shun controversy for a variety of  reasons\r\n\r\nand  I  do not propose to go into these reasons here.\r\n\r\nThey  act  as  if politics and affairs of  state  are\r\n\r\ntaboo, the prerogative of Government leaders and  MPs\r\n\r\nalone,  The  newspapers,  radio  and  television  are\r\n\r\ndevoid  of opinions on political issues or Government\r\n\r\npolicies.  No,  it  is  not  their  business  to  get\r\n\r\ninvolved in such matters. Who knows what will  happen\r\n\r\nif  you  utter the wrong words or espouse  the  wrong\r\n\r\nthings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems clear to me that this Government has\r\n\r\ndeclared that it will not even put communists and pro-communists  behind bars if only they  will  \"denounce\r\n\r\nthe CPM's use of force to seize power, and themselves\r\n\r\nforswear    the   use   of   force   to   unseat    a\r\n\r\nconstitutionally elected government.\" If this is  so,\r\n\r\nwhat is there to worry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, Sir, I must congratulate the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Chai Chee for starting a  monthly\r\n\r\nMeet-the-People  Forum so that his  constituents  can\r\n\r\nraise  and thrash out any issues on Government policy\r\n\r\nor   implementations.  Likewise   the   mass   media,\r\n\r\nincluding  radio and television, civic  organisations\r\n\r\nand  community centres can similarly serve  as  forum\r\n\r\nfor   public   debate.  MPs  and   Ministers   should\r\n\r\nparticipate if invited. It would be a welcome  change\r\n\r\nif   the  Chairman  of  the  Public  Utilities  Board\r\n\r\nparticipates  in  a TV forum on PUB  charges  or  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Defence arguing the case  for  national\r\n\r\nservice  for  women  on TV against  anxious  parents,\r\n\r\nhusbands  or  lovers, or indeed the hon.

Members of the  House\r\n\r\nin their support of the President's Address delivered\r\n\r\nat  the  opening of the First Session of  the  Fourth\r\n\r\nTuesday, 8th February, 1977.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President pointed out that our\r\n\r\nGovernment  has a mandate to reject the  soft-headed,\r\n\r\npernicious policies that all the good things in life,\r\n\r\nfrom bus rides to PUB charges, can be given for free,\r\n\r\nor  otherwise to reduce the fares or charges when the\r\n\r\ncosts  are  going  up.  This applies  to  our  social\r\n\r\npolicies  which have been formulated with a  view  to\r\n\r\ngiving  a better life to our people. Whatever  social\r\n\r\npolicies  we  formulate must perforce be governed  by\r\n\r\nour  tradition of enterprise, industry and desire for\r\n\r\nexcellence,   We   have  to  avoid   the   idealistic\r\n\r\nphilosophy   of  the  welfare  state   in   supplying\r\n\r\neverything free to everybody who wants it from cradle\r\n\r\nto  grave,  and  in giving a cushion  to  people  who\r\n\r\nsuffer   hardships  or  difficulties   arising   from\r\n\r\npersonal    inadequacies   irrespective   of    their\r\n\r\ncapability  or  willingness  to  make  an  effort  in\r\n\r\novercoming  them. No one, not even the  poor,  should\r\n\r\nexpect  to  be carried for free, expecting others  to\r\n\r\nshoulder the burden while they sit back as passengers\r\n\r\nunwilling to make a contribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of social services, the basic social\r\n\r\namenities  and  services  have  already  been   well-established. Even recipients of public assistance are\r\n\r\nbeing  encouraged, trained and helped along to  work,\r\n\r\nwherever possible. The Social Welfare Department  has\r\n\r\nalready  intensified its efforts to place the  Public\r\n\r\nAssistance  recipients, their spouses or children  in\r\n\r\ngainful  employment. This is in  line  with  the  new\r\n\r\npolicy  of  offering  suitable  employment  to  those\r\n\r\nPublic  Assistance  recipients  who  can  work,   and\r\n\r\nplacing  those who are untrained on training schemes.\r\n\r\nA Self-Employment Assistance Scheme to help\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic  Assistance recipients and other poor  persons\r\n\r\nto  be self-supporting has recently been, introduced.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  scheme, interest-free loans are  made  to\r\n\r\npersons in need who require money as capital  to  set\r\n\r\nthemselves  up  in  their own small  businesses.  The\r\n\r\nloans could be used, for example, to buy equipment to\r\n\r\nset  up  a hawker stall or to buy sewing machines  so\r\n\r\nthat  tailoring orders could be accepted. The  Scheme\r\n\r\nwill  help  needy persons by instilling in  them  the\r\n\r\ndesire  for  independence and productive  living.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  they  will not have to  be  dependent  on\r\n\r\npublic aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the destitutes will soon be placed on a new\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  work and training. The Government  has\r\n\r\nalready  approved funds to construct a  new  home  at\r\n\r\nChia  Keng  I for destitutes for their rehabilitative\r\n\r\ntraining. The trainable destitutes will be encouraged\r\n\r\nto acquire the work discipline and skills in order to\r\n\r\nfit themselves into the world of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care of the aged is a problem which requires urgent\r\n\r\nattention.  The tradition in Asian countries  is  for\r\n\r\nthe  aged to be looked after by their children,  This\r\n\r\nis  a  laudable tradition which should be  encouraged\r\n\r\nand   preserved.  In  Western  countries  it  is  not\r\n\r\nuncommon to find old folks being isolated from  their\r\n\r\nfamilies. Some are sent to old people's homes; others\r\n\r\nlive on their own. When we visit these countries,  we\r\n\r\noften see lonely old people sitting in the park  with\r\n\r\ndogs  or cats as their constant companions. We should\r\n\r\nlearn  a lesson from the social experiences of  these\r\n\r\ncountries.   We  should  strengthen  our  traditional\r\n\r\nvalues  of filial piety and respect for elders  which\r\n\r\nwould  preserve the kinship ties and  thus  keep  the\r\n\r\nextended family intact. Through the granting  of  tax\r\n\r\nrelief  for  dependent parents and grandparents,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  already recognises the need to  encourage\r\n\r\npeople  to  look  after their dependent  parents  and\r\n\r\ngrand-parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much more important is social education to reduce\r\n\r\nthe   generation  gap.  The  young  must   learn   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  those who are older. Children must  learn\r\n\r\nto  understand their parents so as to build  a  close\r\n\r\nrelationship with them. Parents in turn must learn to\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasonable with their children, to be close  to  them\r\n\r\nand  provide  the best possible climate at  home  for\r\n\r\ntheir  individual growth. In this way,  many  of  the\r\n\r\nsocial   problems  we  have  been  facing  could   be\r\n\r\nprevented or at least minimised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy for those who merely want to govern by\r\n\r\ngaining   popularity  to  beguile  the  public   with\r\n\r\npromises to provide everything for free. We cannot be\r\n\r\nlike  some  Western countries which  adopt  what  the\r\n\r\nAmericans   call  the  \"pork  barrel\"   approach   of\r\n\r\ngovernment  by  making use of public money  for  vote\r\n\r\ncatching  purposes.  Instead of  encouraging  private\r\n\r\ninitiative  to work out solutions for the  community,\r\n\r\nthey  move in under one pretext or another to provide\r\n\r\nfor  services  whether or not they are really  wanted\r\n\r\nand  whether  or not they do any good.  Even  in  the\r\n\r\nfield of social services, welfare state concepts have\r\n\r\nbrought difficulties to many Western countries. There\r\n\r\nare  dangers of evolving such a system for it  breeds\r\n\r\nlaziness  and indifference. It leads to the erroneous\r\n\r\nbelief  that  the  good things in  life  can  be  got\r\n\r\nwithout sustained effort, and that it is the duty  of\r\n\r\nthe government to act as the \"universal provider\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of the socialist ideology, coupled with\r\n\r\nthe  great  work done by social workers in the  slums\r\n\r\nand  ravages  of the second world war, brought  about\r\n\r\nmany  changes  in the philosophy of social  services.\r\n\r\nThe present thinking is that people must be helped to\r\n\r\nhelp  themselves. Welfare should not be  just  doling\r\n\r\nout   reliefs   and  benefits.  It   must   be   more\r\n\r\ndevelopmental. This in fact strikes the key  note  of\r\n\r\nour social policy. Social services in the future will\r\n\r\nbe  geared  towards  the  development  of  individual\r\n\r\ninitiative, creativity, and the will and  ability  to\r\n\r\ndo  productive work. Social measures will be aimed at\r\n\r\nthe  creation  of  renewed economic independence  and\r\n\r\nproductive living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, before I speak, in this\r\n\r\nfestive season, let me wish you, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  and  all hon. Members a Happy  Chinese  New\r\n\r\nYear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the  Member  for Ulu Pandan  thanking  the\r\n\r\nPresident  for  his  speech  delivered  on  the   8th\r\n\r\nFebruary, outlining the Government's policy.  In  the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Address, three important  aspects  have\r\n\r\nbeen   highlighted.  First,  in  promoting   national\r\n\r\nconsciousness,  we  should  strive  to   instil   the\r\n\r\nprecept,  namely, \"From each his best;  To  each  his\r\n\r\nworth.\" This will alienate the social parasites. This\r\n\r\ncorrect  directive will make for diligence and  self-reliance.  Secondly, we should select  what  is  best\r\n\r\nfrom  the  West  and  fit it  into  our  context  and\r\n\r\nrealistic  situations  so as  to  promote  all  round\r\n\r\ndevelopment. Unlike some other countries, we  do  not\r\n\r\nblindly  ape  foreign  examples  or  regard  anything\r\n\r\nforeign as golden rules. For by so doing we will only\r\n\r\nsucceed  in driving the country to the dogs. Thirdly,\r\n\r\nwe  must  learn  the experience of the  Japanese  and\r\n\r\nunderstand  how  Japan was able to transform  herself\r\n\r\ninto  a  modern  industrial nation in less  than  100\r\n\r\nyears  since the Meiji Restoration of 1868. No doubt,\r\n\r\nfor a country like ours, devoid of natural resources,\r\n\r\nwe have no other choice but to utilise the hard work,\r\n\r\nindustry,  intelligence  and  the  spirit  of   self-reliance of our people and to adopt certain pragmatic\r\n\r\nmeasures  in our development, in addition to adopting\r\n\r\nall practical constructive policy so as to assure our\r\n\r\nfuture and our development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy speech also emphasised that we have to\r\n\r\nface  the  fact of a slower economic growth rate  and\r\n\r\nthat we should adjust our spending habits, both as  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  and as individuals. This  means  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to be pragmatic and realistic and that we  have\r\n\r\nto  lead a simple and austere life. In fact, a frugal\r\n\r\nlife style is a traditional oriental virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy speech also indicates that we should\r\n\r\nlearn  from the experience of the Japanese.  I  share\r\n\r\nthe  same sentiments, because the Japanese people are\r\n\r\nnot only hardworking and self-disciplined but also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimbued  with the spirit of patriotism and a love  for\r\n\r\ntheir  national products. Of course, our  people  are\r\n\r\nalso imbued with a high sense of patriotism, so, that\r\n\r\nwe  are  able  to achieve much in a short  period  of\r\n\r\ntime.  However,  there  is a  shortcoming  among  our\r\n\r\npeople,  that  is, a lack of confidence  in  our  own\r\n\r\nlocal products. Let me give an example. According  to\r\n\r\na  newspaper report, certain jeans made in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwere  shipped  to a foreign country and chopped  with\r\n\r\nthe  words,  \"Made  in  -(the  name  of  the  foreign\r\n\r\ncountry)\", and then they were sent back to  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  sold  at  a  price  four  or  five  times  above\r\n\r\nSingapore made jeans. In other words, the jeans  made\r\n\r\nin Singapore costing only $9 to $11 a piece, had gone\r\n\r\nup  to  $30-$5O if they were chopped with  the  words\r\n\r\n\"Made  in  -\", a  foreign  country.  Yet  our  local\r\n\r\nconsumers do not mind spending so much money for such\r\n\r\njeans.  There  are  a lot of examples  of  a  similar\r\n\r\nnature.   What   does  this  show?   It   shows   the\r\n\r\nmanifestation of the xenophilous psychology,  feeling\r\n\r\nthat local ginger is not hot enough and that the moon\r\n\r\nin  foreign  countries is rounder than  the  moon  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from embarking on industrialisation and\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industries and  expanding  our  export\r\n\r\nmarkets,  we  have  also to take  positive  steps  to\r\n\r\nconvince  and persuade our local people  to  buy  our\r\n\r\nlocal  products. This will not only save us a lot  of\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange but also earns for us  an  expanded\r\n\r\nmarket  for  our products. It is also to be  stressed\r\n\r\nthat this is an act of patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no doubt that in the last 10 years,\r\n\r\nbecause  of economic prosperity and increased incomes\r\n\r\nof  the  people, certain portion of our  people  have\r\n\r\ntaken  to  some unwholesome habits. They are obsessed\r\n\r\nby  an  urge to seek material comforts and  enjoyment\r\n\r\nwithout working. This is a bad phenomenon. We have to\r\n\r\nrekindle  the love and respect for labour  among  our\r\n\r\npeople.  How are we going to do that? I believe  that\r\n\r\nwe should adopt certain measures or policies. One, we\r\n\r\nshould  shorten the wage differentials, for instance,\r\n\r\nbetween an engineer earning from $1,200 to $1,500 and\r\n\r\nan  ordinary construction worker earning only $200 to\r\n\r\n$300 per month. Of course, this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresults  in  a shortage of labour in the construction\r\n\r\nindustry,  and therefore need to recruit labour  from\r\n\r\nforeign  countries. Our Minister for  Labour  has  on\r\n\r\nmany  occasions  emphasised the need  to  adjust  the\r\n\r\nwages between the managerial grade and that of manual\r\n\r\nworkers. I welcome such constructive policy  and  its\r\n\r\nearly  implementation. Secondly, we must  foster  the\r\n\r\nsocial  vogue  of respect for labour and  accord  the\r\n\r\ndiligent  worker  with adequate  reward  and  honour,\r\n\r\nbecause   workers  and  labourers  have  made   great\r\n\r\ncontributions to our national construction. Annually,\r\n\r\non  National  Day we award all classes of  medals  to\r\n\r\npeople who have rendered meritorious services to  our\r\n\r\ncountry;  but  we have yet to find a  labourer  or  a\r\n\r\nworker   among   those  awarded  by  the   President.\r\n\r\nTherefore.  I  think we should institute  an  honours\r\n\r\nlist   for  our  workers  in  recognition  of   their\r\n\r\nmeritorious  contributions to our  country.  Thirdly,\r\n\r\nevery year the Government awards many scholarships to\r\n\r\nstudents who excel in their studies, yet we have  not\r\n\r\n`given any scholarship to workers who are capable and\r\n\r\nintelligent. Such awards will enable them to  further\r\n\r\ntheir  studies.  I therefore suggest that  we  should\r\n\r\nconsider  the  institution of a scholarship  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers  in order to nurture a pool of elite workers.\r\n\r\nSuch a step will help to promote a spirit of love for\r\n\r\nlabour among the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember in last June, under the\r\n\r\nauspices  of  the Prime Minister, we  carried  out  a\r\n\r\nnation-wide campaign on \"Use Your Hands\". This  is  a\r\n\r\ncampaign  rich in education significance.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat we should frequently carry out such an educative\r\n\r\ncampaign.  Not only all the MPs should take  part  in\r\n\r\nthis  educational campaign, civil servants  from  the\r\n\r\ntop  echelon  to the middle grades should  also  take\r\n\r\npart  in  labour, so as to enable them to  experience\r\n\r\nthe  significance of labour and help promote the good\r\n\r\nvogue of respect for labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on certain problems in the\r\n\r\nAddenda.  In  the  various Addenda,  I  paid  special\r\n\r\nattention  to the problems faced by the  hawkers,  in\r\n\r\nparticular the raising of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhawker licence fees. This will mean an increased cost\r\n\r\nto  the  hawkers. According to my knowledge,  licence\r\n\r\nfees  at certain food centres are already high. Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  paying the licence fees they have  to  pay  PUB\r\n\r\ncharges.  If  licence fees are revised upwards,  this\r\n\r\nwill  mean  a greater burden to them, and  they  will\r\n\r\npass  on  such increased cost to the consumers.  This\r\n\r\nwill lead to another bout of inflation, Therefore, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, before the Government does anything  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  hawker licence fees,  it  should  give\r\n\r\ncareful  consideration  and try  to  abolish  it.  It\r\n\r\nshould review the matter of taxes and see what  could\r\n\r\nbe  increased and what could not be increased. It  is\r\n\r\nvery  easy  to  increase taxes. The  race  course  is\r\n\r\ncrowded  with bettors and gamblers. If the Turf  Club\r\n\r\nincreases  its  admission fee by, say,  $5  then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  collect  millions  of  dollars   in\r\n\r\nrevenue. But the people who patronise the food stalls\r\n\r\ncome  mostly from the middle and lower income groups,\r\n\r\nsuch  as office workers, taxi drivers, civil servants\r\n\r\nand  trishaw-riders. They are able to get cheap meals\r\n\r\nat these centres and this indirectly helps to lighten\r\n\r\ntheir  cost of living. Mr Speaker, Sir, if  you  will\r\n\r\nremember,  it  is  the policy of  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nresite  the  hawkers at the various food  centres  to\r\n\r\nenable  them  to  make a living and also  to  provide\r\n\r\ncheap meals. It also aims to stabilise and reduce the\r\n\r\ncost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another authority which contemplates raising tariffs\r\n\r\nis the PUB. This has caused concern among the people,\r\n\r\nespecially those in the lower income group. A lot  of\r\n\r\npeople  have  found  these  yearly  increase  in  PUB\r\n\r\ncharges very burdensome. I agree that nothing is  for\r\n\r\nfree  in this world, If you want something, you  must\r\n\r\npay  for  it.  However,  water  and  electricity  are\r\n\r\nessential commodites. They are not luxuries  and  the\r\n\r\ncharges are already high. So as a trusted Government,\r\n\r\nI  believe it is the Government's duty to offer  such\r\n\r\nservices  to  the people as conducive to their  well-being.  The  PUB  should not be run as  a  commercial\r\n\r\nenterprise  which  only thinks in  terms  of  profit-making.   Furthermore,  the   PUB   has   accumulated\r\n\r\nconsiderable  surpluses  over  the  years.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, the Government should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsider subsidising certain services provided by the\r\n\r\nPUB just as the President has said in his speech that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  subsidising  education,  medical\r\n\r\nservices, and housing. Whilst our economy is still in\r\n\r\nthe  midst  of  recovery, I  do  not  agree  to  such\r\n\r\nincrease in PUB charges. I also agree with the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Leng  Kee who suggested in this `House  on  14th\r\n\r\nFebruary 1977 that all those surcharges to PUB  bills\r\n\r\nshould be abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received numerous complaints from my\r\n\r\nconstituents  that their PUB bills have  unexpectedly\r\n\r\nincreased,  by sometimes more than 100%. Payment  for\r\n\r\nthe  previous month's bill was $50, this month it has\r\n\r\nrisen to $120. It is like a rising tide. However,  in\r\n\r\nthe  matter  of  PUB charges, they never  come  down.\r\n\r\nAfter  investigation, such amounts are  found  to  be\r\n\r\nbased on estimates and not because of their increased\r\n\r\nconsumption;  the excess could be deducted  from  the\r\n\r\nnext  bill.  My  constituents  asked  why  are  these\r\n\r\nestimates not based on figures of the previous month.\r\n\r\nSuch  complaints  are quite common. I  believe,  Sir,\r\n\r\neven  among  your constituents you have  come  across\r\n\r\nsuch  complaints. Whose fault is this?  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Manager of PUB should be blamed, because  he\r\n\r\nhas  not  directed his subordinate officers to  carry\r\n\r\nout  their  work properly, thus causing inconvenience\r\n\r\nto  the  people  and  their  discontent  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. I appeal to the Chairman of the PUB,  who\r\n\r\nis   none   other  than  the  Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Communications, to  restructure  or\r\n\r\nreorganise the administrative set-up of the PUB so as\r\n\r\nto render satisfactory service to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the Addendum on the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture.  The  Addendum advocates the policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  develop  Singapore's  rich   cultural\r\n\r\nheritage derived from the Malay, Chinese, Indian  and\r\n\r\nWestern  civilisations,  and,  through  their  cross-fertilisation,   to   evolve  a   national   cultural\r\n\r\nidentity.  The Ministry of Culture will  continue  to\r\n\r\norganise  a  wide range of activities  to  promote  a\r\n\r\nbetter appreciation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  cultural heritage. Of course, such a  policy  is\r\n\r\nentirely  correct. But in practice, do we drive  home\r\n\r\nthis  spirit in our actual work? I think there  is  a\r\n\r\ngap between what we advocate and what we really do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our TV programmes are imported. Locally\r\n\r\nproduced programmes are few in number. For example, a\r\n\r\ncertain marketing consultancy company has carried out\r\n\r\na  survey of TV viewers and found that there  are  10\r\n\r\nmost popular programmes like \"The Heroes\" and \"Beauty\r\n\r\nof  an Era\", Among them only one is locally produced,\r\n\r\nnamely,  \"Musical Showcase\", But 80% of the  artistes\r\n\r\nappearing   in   that  programme  are  from   abroad.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   we   can  see  that   locally   produced\r\n\r\nprogrammes are few in number and the standard is also\r\n\r\nrather low. This is a matter for regret. Therefore, I\r\n\r\nsuggest that the Ministry concerned should go all out\r\n\r\nto  nurture our artistic talents and to produce  more\r\n\r\nlocal  TV  programmes befitting  local  situation  in\r\n\r\norder  to  meet  the  demands of  the  people  for  a\r\n\r\ncultural life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Addendum on the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment it says that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In addition to the provision of HDB flats for\r\n\r\nresidential cases, there will be alternative premises\r\n\r\nor  cash  payments  in  lieu for shops,  resettlement\r\n\r\nfacilities for specific trades ...`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, all these measures and facilities will\r\n\r\nalleviate   the   hardship  of  those   affected   by\r\n\r\nresettlement. They have to understand that the aim of\r\n\r\nresettlement  is  in the long-term interests  of  the\r\n\r\nnation,  If they can, they will give further  support\r\n\r\nto the policies of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my constituency, certain areas\r\n\r\nof  land  have been requisitioned by the  Government.\r\n\r\nThe  areas  affected are: a portion of  Jalan  Pasar,\r\n\r\nSembawang, a portion of Andrews Avenue at the  1  5th\r\n\r\nmile, and  certain portion of the land near  Tanjong\r\n\r\nIrau  at  the  15th  mile.  About  100  families  aye\r\n\r\naffected  by the resettlement scheme, among them  are\r\n\r\nseven  shop premises. These people came several times\r\n\r\nto  ask me concerning resettlement matters, and  also\r\n\r\nabout how long they could continue to reside in those\r\n\r\nplaces or how long they could carry on with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  business  there,  As the  MP  for  this  rural\r\n\r\nconstituency,  of  course,  it  is  my  duty  to   be\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  their welfare.  Therefore.  I  made\r\n\r\nenquiries  from  the  Ministry concerned,  The  reply\r\n\r\ngiven  was that it might take a few years more before\r\n\r\nactual enforcement of the resettlement. In fact, they\r\n\r\nwere  also  not very clear about the situation,  Such\r\n\r\nvague  answers  are not satisfactory, For  the  well-being of my constituents, to alleviate their hardship\r\n\r\nand  to allay their worries I would urge the Minister\r\n\r\nto  pay  particular  attention to  the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nResettlement  Department.  He  should  instruct   the\r\n\r\nofficers  in the Resettlement Department to abide  by\r\n\r\nthe Government's policy of caring for the welfare  of\r\n\r\nthe people, and not cause unnecessary trouble or loss\r\n\r\nto the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring two valid complaints to the\r\n\r\nattention   of  the  relevant  authorities,   In   my\r\n\r\nconstituency, there is a school which is known as Hwa\r\n\r\nKwang  School,  whose land has been acquired  by  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board. They have come  to  an\r\n\r\nagreement  on  the quantum of compensation.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  rental for the land has been increased by  800%,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  school used to pay $10 a  year  to  the\r\n\r\nformer   landlord,  but  now  the  rental  has   been\r\n\r\nincreased by the HDB to $80 per month. Such a measure\r\n\r\nis  highly irrational. Firstly, the School Management\r\n\r\nCommittee  was  responsible for the building  of  the\r\n\r\nschool,  and it has been in existence for  more  than\r\n\r\nten  years. The Housing and Development Board has not\r\n\r\nspent  a  single  cent on the school.  Secondly, the\r\n\r\nschool is a place for the education of our young  and\r\n\r\nnot  a  profit-making enterprise. In the  President's\r\n\r\npolicy  speech  it is stated that  it  is  still  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy to subsidise education,  medical\r\n\r\nand  housing  services. This school is an educational\r\n\r\ninstitution.  Therefore, it is right and  proper  for\r\n\r\nthis school to get a subsidy from the Government. The\r\n\r\nHDB's  action is a departure from Government  policy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is unreasonable for the HDB to increase\r\n\r\nthe  rental  for the land. I would urge the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned to consider rescinding such an act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly seven shopkeepers who are voters have\r\n\r\ncomplained to me that they have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreceived  notices from the HDB telling  them  not  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  their businesses  because  they  were\r\n\r\nconsidered  illegal. However, these  people  told  me\r\n\r\nthat  they  have been carrying on such businesses  in\r\n\r\nthose  areas  for more than ten years,  Although  the\r\n\r\npremises originally were meant for dwelling purposes,\r\n\r\nthey had converted them into shop premises. Some  ten\r\n\r\nyears  ago, in the rural areas there were hardly  any\r\n\r\nshops, because neither the Government nor the private\r\n\r\ndevelopers would be interested in building shophouses\r\n\r\nthere.  Therefore, it is only natural for  the  rural\r\n\r\ndwellers  to make use of their premises as  shops  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a service for the rural people, Can  we  say\r\n\r\nthat  they  have done wrong? However, ever since  the\r\n\r\nHDB  acquired such areas, they were branded as people\r\n\r\nwho were doing, illegal business and were required to\r\n\r\nstop such activities immediately. Is it reasonable to\r\n\r\ndo  so? I would like the Senior Minister of State  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate into these circumstances in order to give\r\n\r\nthese  people a fair deal. Sir, I support the  motion\r\n\r\nof thanks on behalf of my constituents,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 pm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since last week\r\n\r\nduring the debate on the President's Address to  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  many of my colleagues on the Backbench,  both\r\n\r\nnew  and  old, have stated their views on  Government\r\n\r\npolicies for the next five years,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am going to state may be a repetition of some\r\n\r\nof the issues and problems already raised; however  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  such repetitions are sometimes necessary  if\r\n\r\nwe are to get results,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have read the Addenda to the Presidential\r\n\r\nAddress   which   cover  the  entire   framework   of\r\n\r\nGovernment policies for the next five years. In fact.\r\n\r\nall   the   policies  pertaining   to   the   various\r\n\r\nMinistries, in  my view, can be  summed  up  in  the\r\n\r\nPresident's statement that \"we have to formulate  our\r\n\r\nway  of  life, taking what is best from the West  and\r\n\r\nfitting  it  into  the Singapore context\".  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, we must build up our national\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nidentity  based  on the multi-racial,  multicultural,\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual and multi-religious characteristics  of\r\n\r\nour society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Sir, the Prime Minister's statement \"we are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans\" best sums up the national identity that\r\n\r\nSingapore  must eventually evolve, Hence, since  1959\r\n\r\nwhen   the   PAP  swept  into  power,  the  political\r\n\r\nleadership headed by our Prime Minister have  brought\r\n\r\nSingapore  out of near bankruptcy into an independent\r\n\r\nsovereign country in which the people are better-fed,\r\n\r\nbetter-clothed,  better-educated   and   enjoying   a\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living  second  only  to  Japan.   Such\r\n\r\ndedication and the will to succeed despite  all  odds\r\n\r\ndid  not come about that easily. Pragmatic leadership\r\n\r\nand  practical  measures and the cooperation  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  through sheer hard work and their indomitable\r\n\r\nspirit  to  survive have made Singapore  what  it  is\r\n\r\ntoday,  Therefore, Sir, a tribute  to  them  must  be\r\n\r\nplaced on record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore all the more imperative and\r\n\r\nnecessary that our young be constantly reminded  that\r\n\r\nthe good things in life they enjoy today did not come\r\n\r\nabout just by pure chance but as a result of the hard\r\n\r\nwork   put  in  over  the  last  17 1/2  years  by   the\r\n\r\nenlightened PAP leadership and the people,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end I would like to make some comments on\r\n\r\nthe  proposals  of the Education Ministry.  Whilst  I\r\n\r\napplaud some of the good work done, I must hasten  to\r\n\r\nadd that education is a life-long process for it does\r\n\r\nnot  end  with merely a certificate, a diploma  or  a\r\n\r\ndegree,  I  am  no educationist but I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  that  the education system must  be  reviewed\r\n\r\nfrom time to time. On the question of moral and civic\r\n\r\neducation,  I would like to see that our  pupils  are\r\n\r\ntaught  the concept of what I can do for the  society\r\n\r\nand  not what I can get from the society. The Chinese\r\n\r\naphorism of (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) should be imbued deep in\r\n\r\ntheir minds in their early years of their education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will disagree that the education system has\r\n\r\nto  be  reviewed from time to time for it is  in  our\r\n\r\nnational interests. The various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures listed in the Addendum are not new. In fact,\r\n\r\nthe  so-called  revision of  the  system  of  primary\r\n\r\neducation  is  not  an improvement,  it  is  a  clear\r\n\r\nadmission  that  automatic  promotion  has   been   a\r\n\r\nfailure.  I  am not setting out on a witch-hunt.  Now\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry has to fall back onto the  old  system.\r\n\r\nthat  is,  promotion  based on  passing  examinations\r\n\r\nthough the term annual assessments has been used  but\r\n\r\nit means just the same, Therefore automatic promotion\r\n\r\nhas brought about a social problem - pupils unable to\r\n\r\ncope  up with their lessons leave school with a half-baked  education,  some  are not  articulate  in  any\r\n\r\nlanguage  and  are  thus  unable  to  fit  into   the\r\n\r\nemployment  market.  The  result,  they  laze  around\r\n\r\naimlessly,  cannot get proper jobs  and  easily  fall\r\n\r\nprey  to decadent or evil influences. Also I fail  to\r\n\r\nunderstand how the Basic Course for pupils who cannot\r\n\r\ncope with the Standard Course will learn to read  and\r\n\r\nwrite in one language, do simple arithmetic, as  well\r\n\r\nas  become good citizens. Does the Education Ministry\r\n\r\nseriously  think that by implementing such a  course,\r\n\r\nthese pupils can become good citizens? I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the policy makers believe that this will  be\r\n\r\nthe result. In my view, they should be more realistic\r\n\r\nand  practical.  I  do  not propose  to  recommend  a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry to look into the causes. I say.\r\n\r\nthey  should set up advisory committees which  should\r\n\r\ncomprise retired educationists and teachers who would\r\n\r\nthen  mount an in-depth study of the root causes  and\r\n\r\nof  the shortcomings and then make recommendations to\r\n\r\nimprove upon the primary education system, I am quite\r\n\r\nsure  many  of  these people would be  too  happy  to\r\n\r\nrespond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So also is the same with the system of secondary\r\n\r\neducation.  But I do not wish to go into the  details\r\n\r\nas  I do not think this debate is on education alone.\r\n\r\nI  have other issues to raise also and time is not my\r\n\r\nown. I submit that an overall review of the education\r\n\r\nsystem  is  necessary  and this  is  definitely  long\r\n\r\noverdue.  It may well be that some thought  has  been\r\n\r\nmade towards enumerating the measures as contained in\r\n\r\nthe  Addendum. But I would like to know who are those\r\n\r\ninvolved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin this exercise. Have these policy makers sought the\r\n\r\ncounsel of those who have spent their entire lives in\r\n\r\nteaching and those who are still alive today and  who\r\n\r\nmay   be   too  ready  to  impart  their  wealth   of\r\n\r\nexperience? May I remind the education policy  makers\r\n\r\nthat human resources is all Singapore has.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, if this approach is made, I am sure\r\n\r\nthat  the  pupils, over the years of their  education\r\n\r\nwould  be  better equipped to continue to ensure  our\r\n\r\nlong-term survival. I believe the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nthrough its media of broadcasting and television  can\r\n\r\nhelp  much  in  this  respect.  Its  programmes   and\r\n\r\nproductions  must be carefully planned, selected  and\r\n\r\nthought  out.  In  short  what  is  relevant  to  our\r\n\r\nnational  cultural  evolution towards  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nidentity should be exploited to the optimum, and  not\r\n\r\nthose  of violence and the easy-going life-styles  of\r\n\r\nthe West. This certainly does us more harm than good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by the hon. Member for Kampong Chai\r\n\r\nChee, both Ministries should not nullify each other's\r\n\r\nactions  but  their  actions should  complement  each\r\n\r\nother. The Chinese saying (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) should not\r\n\r\nbe  their  practice. Their actions should, therefore,\r\n\r\nbe complementary in nature (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to touch on is public\r\n\r\ntransportation. It is gratifying to note  that  there\r\n\r\nhas been great improvement made in the last two years\r\n\r\nby  the Singapore Bus Service. However, since the SBS\r\n\r\nwill  be the mainstay of Singapore's public transport\r\n\r\nsystem  pending  the introduction of the  Mass  Rapid\r\n\r\nTransit  System, there is much still to  be  done  to\r\n\r\nimprove  this  system  to  meet  the  needs  of   the\r\n\r\nthousands  of  commuters from all over Singapore  who\r\n\r\nmust  travel  to their places of work,  either  their\r\n\r\noffices or factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ng, I propose to take a suspension at\r\n\r\nthis  stage.

Sir, there should be  co-ordination  between  the  SBS  and  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board to provide services to the  various\r\n\r\nestates  noting  the fact that some 1 50.000  housing\r\n\r\nunits will be completed by\r\n\r\n1980. This service must be available to them. I would\r\n\r\nlike to believe that the commuters should not have to\r\n\r\nwait  longer than necessary to catch a bus  from  one\r\n\r\npoint  to  another or to their place of work.  I  say\r\n\r\nthis  because complaints of lack of bus  services  in\r\n\r\nthe new HDB estates have been made. The residents  in\r\n\r\nthese  new  estates  rightly  deserve  such  service.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I hope my observation on this point  will\r\n\r\nnot fall on deaf ears. After all, an efficient public\r\n\r\ntransport system is not only a natural expectation of\r\n\r\nthe  residents in the HDB estates but also the public\r\n\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about public transport. I cannot but refer\r\n\r\nto  the Addenda on the Ministries of Home Affairs and\r\n\r\nNational Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the statement of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs that roads must be made safer  for  all\r\n\r\nroad  users.  But  I  cannot  subscribe  to  the  two\r\n\r\nproposals of the Ministry of Home Affairs. First,  in\r\n\r\nany  collision between two vehicles of different size\r\n\r\nand weight the driver of the larger vehicle will have\r\n\r\nto  prove that he is not in the wrong, i.e, rebut the\r\n\r\npresumption that he was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  fault. Second, in any fatal accident the  driver,\r\n\r\nwho  is to be charged in court for dangerous driving,\r\n\r\nwill  immediately have his driving licence  suspended\r\n\r\nuntil his trial is completed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the sentiments expressed by the hon, Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kallang  when  he made reference  to  these  two\r\n\r\nproposals.  But  commonsense  tells  me  that  it  is\r\n\r\nagainst  the  principles of established law,  Let  us\r\n\r\nassume  that a lorry, travelling in front of a  motor\r\n\r\ncar, stops at a traffic light and then the motor  car\r\n\r\ntravelling  behind  it hits the rear  of  the  lorry;\r\n\r\nsurely  to presume that the lorry driver is at  fault\r\n\r\nand therefore should be penalised is too far-fetched,\r\n\r\nIs  this not so? I can bring in other examples but  I\r\n\r\nthink have made my point clear enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, let us assume that a motorist is\r\n\r\ndriving  along  a  road where there  is  an  overhead\r\n\r\nbridge for pedestrians. A pedestrian instead of using\r\n\r\nthe  bridge  suddenly  dashes across  the  road,  The\r\n\r\nmotorist  applies his brakes but alas, unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe  pedestrian  is  knocked down,  and  subsequently\r\n\r\ndies,  Is  it  therefore fair to suspend the  driving\r\n\r\nlicence of the motorist if he is charged in court for\r\n\r\ndangerous driving? I would like to believe  that  the\r\n\r\nlegislative  proposals be carefully  reconsidered  in\r\n\r\nthe light of my observations because both drivers are\r\n\r\nbeing unfairly discriminated against. Would not  such\r\n\r\naction be against natural justice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department builds roads and\r\n\r\nmaintains them. Some years ago roads that were  in  a\r\n\r\nbad  state have been repaired. But a couple of  years\r\n\r\nago,  road  taxes and other forms of fees (ARF)  were\r\n\r\nimposed with a view to restricting the growth of  the\r\n\r\ncar population. According to the Ministry of Finance,\r\n\r\nthis was not a revenue-raising exercise but was meant\r\n\r\nto alleviate traffic jams. I believe that millions of\r\n\r\ndollars have been collected by way of such taxes as a\r\n\r\nresult,  but  would it not be fair to  the  motorists\r\n\r\nthat  there  should be a massive campaign to  further\r\n\r\nimprove the conditions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  roads thereby alleviating traffic  jams  and\r\n\r\nreducing transport problems?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about transport problems, I would like to\r\n\r\nrefer  to  the  numerous  so-called  farmways  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency, They are the Lorong Buang Kok  Farmways\r\n\r\nand  Lorong Cheng Lim Farmways, These so-called roads\r\n\r\nhave  been built in Punggol because of the pig  farms\r\n\r\nthat have come in to the areas. I must say that these\r\n\r\nfarmways  are narrow, pot-holed and of laterite.  The\r\n\r\npig  farmers as hon. Members will know, have been re-located   from  the  Kranji  area  for  environmental\r\n\r\nreasons, Good road conditions are essential to  these\r\n\r\nfarmers,  Therefore, these farmways should have  been\r\n\r\nmetalled before the farmers moved in. But this is not\r\n\r\nso,  and they are now asked to make requests  to  the\r\n\r\nUrban   and   Rural   Services  Committee   for   its\r\n\r\nconsideration.  I  hope the Ministry  concerned  will\r\n\r\nenlighten  this House as to the reasons  for  passing\r\n\r\nthe  buck to the URSC. Surely it is not too  much  to\r\n\r\nask for in this respect that services like good roads\r\n\r\nand  brighter street lighting be installed before the\r\n\r\nfarmers  move in. One cannot deny the fact  that  the\r\n\r\npig  farmers  have cooperated and made sacrifices  in\r\n\r\nthe  national interest to move their farms to a  non-catchment area in Punggol and Jalan Kayu and to start\r\n\r\nlife  anew. This is not the first time that they have\r\n\r\nbeen  moved. I have come across, in the course of  my\r\n\r\nvisits,  some  who have been moved four  times.  They\r\n\r\nhave  become bitter, Do we not treat them as pioneers\r\n\r\nin  opening up new frontiers? Only minimum facilities\r\n\r\nlike   water  and  electricity  supplies,  inadequate\r\n\r\ndrainage  are provided for, whereas I was  told  that\r\n\r\nmany  facilities and services would be  available  to\r\n\r\nthem when they move in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more often than not, these farmers are left to\r\n\r\nset up their farms again and even have to comply with\r\n\r\nall  sorts  of rules and regulations of the  Building\r\n\r\nControl   Division   and   the   Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment, not forgetting that the majority  of  the\r\n\r\nfarming families are very large. Let me just give  an\r\n\r\nillustration on the question of compliance  with  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  the  Planning  Department  or   the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control Division. Any minor  alteration  to\r\n\r\ntheir houses, say, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  the  kitchen sited outside the  house  requires\r\n\r\namendment plans and which very often take time to  be\r\n\r\napproved.  These plans for alteration  and  amendment\r\n\r\nare  subject to the close scrutiny of the departments\r\n\r\nI  mentioned  just  now.. What is more  peculiar  and\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  understand  is  the  fact   that   the\r\n\r\nResettlement Department wants these farmers  to  move\r\n\r\nin  quickly  to these areas and these farmers  cannot\r\n\r\nput  up  their buildings unless they comply with  all\r\n\r\nthe   rules   and  regulations  laid  down   by   the\r\n\r\ndepartments concerned. It is also the same  with  the\r\n\r\nrepairs  and extensions to the farm structures.  Sir,\r\n\r\nit  may be my duty to assist them whenever they wish;\r\n\r\nbut  I  do not think that it is fair to these  people\r\n\r\nthat  they should be made to see the MP just  because\r\n\r\nthey  want to site their kitchen outside their  house\r\n\r\nor  make  repairs  to their farm structures.  Already\r\n\r\nthey are busy with their farming activities. May I be\r\n\r\nenlightened as to the duties of the field officers in\r\n\r\nthe  PPD or BCD with regard to the fact that they are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to assist the farmers in this respect,  and\r\n\r\nin what way are they rendering assistance and advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge that henceforth a more humane\r\n\r\nand  sympathetic approach be made when relocation  of\r\n\r\npig  farmers to Jalan Kayu and Punggol is carried out\r\n\r\nin  subsequent  exercises. Sir, I make these  remarks\r\n\r\nbecause  I  have  met the farmers and discussed  with\r\n\r\nthem their problems. I believe that as a result of my\r\n\r\nmeeting, some of the Government officials might  have\r\n\r\nbeen over-enthusiastic in the course of carrying  out\r\n\r\ntheir  duties and thus getting very poor  impression,\r\n\r\nif not dislike, from the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also true in the case of resettlement and re-housing. This point has already been made by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Changi and I do not wish to elaborate  on\r\n\r\nthis  except  to  say that I too have  received  many\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of a similar nature. But in the  case  of\r\n\r\nPunggol, I have resettlement both ways. Clearance and\r\n\r\nresettlement  from  Punggol  to  Punggol  and   other\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  as  well as  farmers  relocated  to\r\n\r\nPunggol.  Suffice it to say that those  affected  are\r\n\r\nextremely bitter and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  with the manner and approach  in  which\r\n\r\nsuch policies are carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am gratified to note that for the improvement of\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas some $20 million has been set  aside\r\n\r\nfor  the next five years. The rural folks' needs  are\r\n\r\nsimple,  that  is, metalled kampong  roads,  brighter\r\n\r\nstreet  lightings, public utilities, better drainage,\r\n\r\nbridges and jetties. These needs are basic. I am sure\r\n\r\nmy  good friends who represent the rural areas  share\r\n\r\nmy  view.  There is still much to be  done  to  these\r\n\r\nareas;  these  folks are willing to  wait  and  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  have overwhelmingly demonstrated their strong\r\n\r\nsupport to the PAP in the last elections. For this we\r\n\r\nare  all  grateful. We can assure them that we  shall\r\n\r\ncontinue to strive to do as much as possible for them\r\n\r\neven  though it takes time. However, they should  not\r\n\r\nbe  made  to wait for too long. Otherwise the  ground\r\n\r\nwill turn from sour to bitter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was elated when the hon. Member for Nee Soon (I am\r\n\r\nafraid  he  is not here) lamented in this House  last\r\n\r\nweek  over  the  plight  of  his  constituency  which\r\n\r\nconstitutes  about 80% of rural folks. I fully  share\r\n\r\nhis  plea  that  more funds should be apportioned  to\r\n\r\nmeet the urgent needs of the rural constituencies. He\r\n\r\nhas  suggested  that  each rural constituency  should\r\n\r\nhave $100,000. I think his suggestion should be taken\r\n\r\nand  be favourably considered by the Government.  But\r\n\r\nas  far  as Punggol is concerned, let me not  be  too\r\n\r\ngenerous  myself, we will go along with the norm.  My\r\n\r\nquestion is, if the Government can spend millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars  to provide more recreational facilities  for\r\n\r\nthe  public,  I  do not think the MPs for  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas are not being fair when they make requests that\r\n\r\nthere  should be further improvements in their  rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies. On this note, Sir, I give my  support\r\n\r\nto the Motion so moved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Let me, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  say  a  few  words  in support  of  the  Motion\r\n\r\nstanding in the name of the Member for Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address has dealt both with the\r\n\r\nnature and scope of the security problem we faced and\r\n\r\nthe  premises underlying Government policies  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the changing social and economic condition\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  It also dealt, in passing,  with  the\r\n\r\nquestion of the social values that we should preserve\r\n\r\nand  inculcate and asserted that more attention would\r\n\r\nbe  paid to \"the cardinal precepts of our long proven\r\n\r\nculture systems\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inculcation of these cardinal precepts; the\r\n\r\nformulation and implementation of Government policies\r\n\r\nrelating  to  our  economic  requirements   and   the\r\n\r\nisolation  of  the political aspects of the  security\r\n\r\nproblem are inter-related. In an important sense they\r\n\r\nall  involve the question of the values that  are  to\r\n\r\ngovern our existence in society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference in the Address to \"the cardinal\r\n\r\nprecepts\"  has  disturbed some hon. Members  as  this\r\n\r\nimplied  a  fundamental difference between Asian  and\r\n\r\nEuropean values on the social plane and, as  life  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  was already an amalgam in various  degrees\r\n\r\nof  Asian and British values, the problem now  became\r\n\r\none  of  identification and selection. What were  the\r\n\r\ncardinal  precepts of the Asian culture systems  that\r\n\r\nshould be preserved so that social and political life\r\n\r\nremained  refined  and  certain  and  what  were  the\r\n\r\nEuropean  values that ought to be accepted by  us  in\r\n\r\nthe  interests of our economic progress. Hon. Members\r\n\r\nwould agree that, whether we like it or not, economic\r\n\r\nprogress and change, there must be in Singapore if we\r\n\r\nwere  to solve our continuing employment and security\r\n\r\nproblems on a relatively permanent basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the task of formulating our educational and\r\n\r\nsocial  policies on such selection is, I  am  afraid,\r\n\r\nnot  going  to  be a simple one. We would  have  some\r\n\r\nanxious  moments  and,  if we  are  to  preserve  our\r\n\r\nrational balance and prevent violence in the process,\r\n\r\nwe  should  learn  from  the  \"teachers  by  negative\r\n\r\nexample\"  -  an attractive phrase. For non-communists\r\n\r\nin Southeast Asia, the latest of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch teachers is Indo-China, in particular Cambodia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marxist-Leninist dogma which is disrupting much of\r\n\r\nAsia  is  a  crude  and  savage European  theory.  It\r\n\r\nemerged  Out  of  certain  specific  conditions  that\r\n\r\nobtained  in  European society more  than  a  hundred\r\n\r\nyears  ago. It is diametrically opposed to the  time-tested  values  of  the  Asian  culture-systems.  The\r\n\r\nhorrible  happenings  in Cambodia  demonstrated  once\r\n\r\nagain  the  fate  that inevitably befell  people  who\r\n\r\nallowed a communist take-over of their society.  Non-communists   in  Southeast  Asia  must  now   address\r\n\r\nthemselves to the task of preventing such take-overs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent revelations in Singapore have once again high-lighted the nature and enormity of the problem we\r\n\r\nfaced.  It  involved  anti-national  activities   and\r\n\r\ndeceit.  It  also  involved  a  pernicious  form   of\r\n\r\nintellectual   dishonesty  perpetrated   within   the\r\n\r\nSocialist  International by  foreign  Marxist  groups\r\n\r\nacting  in  concert  with  a pro-communist  group  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  have  collared this  group;  but  the\r\n\r\nsecurity problem as typified by it should be  grasped\r\n\r\nin all its aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, of course, referring to the recent G. Raman\r\n\r\nrevelations that resulted in the arrest and detention\r\n\r\nof  his  group of pro-communist collaborators.  These\r\n\r\ngentlemen   were  associated,  in  their  clandestine\r\n\r\nschemes  and  activities with foreign communists  and\r\n\r\npro-communists  like  Malcolm  CaIdwell, who  is   a\r\n\r\nlecturer  in  economic  history  in  the  School   of\r\n\r\nOriental and African Studies. London; Amir Dastan,  a\r\n\r\nMalaysian  communist  now living  in  the  salubrious\r\n\r\nenvironment of Ireland and A. Balakrishnan  who  runs\r\n\r\nthe  Maoist Workers' Institute in London.  There  are\r\n\r\nalso other minor individuals teaching in universities\r\n\r\nin  other countries. It is significant that all these\r\n\r\ngentlemen,  including  the  Raman  group,  live   and\r\n\r\nprosper in countries where parliamentary democracy is\r\n\r\nan  active principle of political life. Not for  them\r\n\r\nthe  paradise  of  countries where communist  parties\r\n\r\nhave imposed their dictatorships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, post-1917 history has given the world vivid\r\n\r\nillustrations of how all-powerful general\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecretaries of communist parties in power have  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  intellectuals of the stripe of these  gentlemen\r\n\r\nafter  they have outlived their usefulness. They  are\r\n\r\nliquidated  or  banished  to concentration  camps  to\r\n\r\nundergo  corrective thinking through hard  labour  or\r\n\r\nput  away  in lunatic asylums. Marxists in opposition\r\n\r\nin  democratic countries talk volumes about democracy\r\n\r\nand  the  lack  of  it in parliamentary  democracies;\r\n\r\nabout equality and the lack of it in such democracies\r\n\r\nand  about  exploitation and the fullness  of  it  in\r\n\r\nthese  democracies. Marxists in power, however, after\r\n\r\nliquidating  non-marxist parties  and  intellectuals,\r\n\r\nhave ended up by killing off their erstwhile comrades\r\n\r\nwho  had  doctrinal differences with  the  clique  in\r\n\r\npower.  It  should not be difficult for  a  political\r\n\r\nanalyst to abstract from post 1917 communist history,\r\n\r\na  universal  law  that governed the  development  of\r\n\r\ncommunist  dictatorships. We already see in Cambodia,\r\n\r\nthe  incarnation of the ultimate barbarity that  Marx\r\n\r\nhad predicted for capitalist societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is of immediate relevance to us is that our\r\n\r\neducational  system appears to have produced  in  the\r\n\r\nRaman  group, men who were feeble enough in mind  and\r\n\r\ncharacter to succumb to Marxist mythology despite the\r\n\r\nphenomenal  progress registered in Singapore  in  all\r\n\r\nthe  major fields of endeavour. In fact, there  is  a\r\n\r\nschool  of  thought which affirms that  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nsocial  and  economic change registered in  Singapore\r\n\r\nduring  the  last decade was too rapid to enable  our\r\n\r\npeople to make necessary adjustments. This indeed  is\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  that  Raman  had  thought   fit   to\r\n\r\ncharacterize  in  a letter that he wrote  to  Malcolm\r\n\r\n10th September, 1974\r\n\r\nfreak  created by British Imperialism. He went on  to\r\n\r\nassert that British Imperialism was culpable for  the\r\n\r\nsins  that its lap-dog was perpetrating. The sin that\r\n\r\nRaman  was  concerned  about  was,  of  course,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's    consistent   policy   of    detaining\r\n\r\ncommunists and pro-communists for so long as they did\r\n\r\nnot  denounce  and  disavow the violence  and  terror\r\n\r\nemployed  by  the CPM to achieve its political  ends.\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore  Government was said to be  repressive\r\n\r\nbecause it repressed the pro-communists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  interests  of  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. But the present regimes in Indo-China were\r\n\r\nsaid   to   be   democratic  because  the  communists\r\n\r\nrepressed  and  liquidated everybody else.  This,  in\r\n\r\nessence,  is  the  intellectual  dishonesty  that  we\r\n\r\nshould expect from Marxist groups. It is reflected in\r\n\r\n21st May, 1975\r\n\r\nby Raman to Malcolm CaIdwell in which he stated:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the Vietnamese people have given the world a gift\r\n\r\nwhich  should  inspire us to greater  endeavour.  Our\r\n\r\nsalutes  go  to  all  those  who  are  fighting   the\r\n\r\noppressors.  It  was  a fitting  honour  to  see  the\r\n\r\nportrait  of  Uncle Ho being carried  throughout  the\r\n\r\ncapitals of the world'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members would see how the question of  values,\r\n\r\nethical  values,  are  bound  up  with  our  security\r\n\r\nproblem. Raman and some of his colleagues had all the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  education and progress  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nsociety  could  give, but they repaid their  debt  by\r\n\r\nturning against that same society and calling it  the\r\n\r\nlap-dog of imperialism,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rehabilitation of such benighted individuals to\r\n\r\nnormal  life  is  going to be a  long  process.

Whilst we  have\r\n\r\nachieved  full employment by using these  categories,\r\n\r\nit  is also true that their impact on our traditional\r\n\r\nAsian values has resulted in the progressive break-up\r\n\r\nof  our time-tested family system which has been  the\r\n\r\nfoundation  for  our  social  ethics.  We  need  only\r\n\r\nexamine some of the assumptions behind our Income Tax\r\n\r\nAct  and  the  family law provisions of  the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter  to  appreciate  how  they  are  helping   to\r\n\r\ndissolve our family system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the implications of modernisation is\r\n\r\nthat  our traditional values have had to give way  to\r\n\r\nthe   new  essentially  materialist  values   of   an\r\n\r\nindustrial  society  and we have ourselves  told  our\r\n\r\npeople that the only measurable criterion that  could\r\n\r\nbe  employed  in ascertaining the worth  of  a  human\r\n\r\nbeing in society is his economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworth,  If  we  accept the inexorable logic  of  this\r\n\r\ndoctrine,  I  hasten to say that  we  would  find  it\r\n\r\nextremely  difficult to preserve our desirable  Asian\r\n\r\nvalues  in  the context of our democratic system.  We\r\n\r\nmay   have   to  evolve  a  more  authoritarian   and\r\n\r\npatriarchal  form of society to achieve  the  desired\r\n\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the ultimate dispensation, the time has\r\n\r\ncome  for  us  to begin laying stress on non-material\r\n\r\nvalues  so  that  human life can  become  whole  once\r\n\r\nagain.

If the basic unit of our society is to  be\r\n\r\nthe family and not the individual the Government must\r\n\r\nrethink  its policies on the basis of the family  and\r\n\r\nnot the individual. A beginning could be made at once\r\n\r\nin the practice of the Housing and Development Board,\r\n\r\nwhich is unable under current policy to transfer  the\r\n\r\ntenancies of flats from a tenant who dies to  another\r\n\r\nmember of the family - say from a dead husband  to  a\r\n\r\nsurviving  wife  or in the event of divorce  from  an\r\n\r\nerring husband to a deserted wife. The consequence is\r\n\r\na  dispossessed family.

Many\r\n\r\neconomists  have long predicted that as a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe   uncontrolled  deficit  budgetting  adopted   by\r\n\r\nwestern   countries   to  maintain   employment   and\r\n\r\nstimulate   economic   growth,   cyclical    economic\r\n\r\nrecession is inevitable and will take place sooner or\r\n\r\nlater.  Coupled with the substantial increase in  the\r\n\r\nprice   of   oil,   economic   recession   has   been\r\n\r\nprecipitated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmuch  earlier, enhancing the slowness and  difficulty\r\n\r\nin economic recovery, This is somewhat unexpected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have noticed that over the past\r\n\r\ntwo  centuries  there have been two breakthroughs  in\r\n\r\nworld civilisation and economy. Each time there was a\r\n\r\nbreakthrough, it was closely related to the discovery\r\n\r\nof  a  source of energy. The first breakthrough  came\r\n\r\nwhen  the  use  of coal led to the discovery  of  the\r\n\r\nsteam   engine.  This  in  turn  led  to  ,the  first\r\n\r\nindustrial  revolution, The second breakthrough  came\r\n\r\nwhen  oil  was first utilised as a source of  energy.\r\n\r\nThis   led   to  the  rapid  development   in   world\r\n\r\ncivilisation and its economy over the last 100 years.\r\n\r\nThis  development has come to its complete  stage  in\r\n\r\n1973 when oil ceased to be a cheap source of energy,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to experts the rate at which oil is being\r\n\r\nconsumed shows that the available sources of oil will\r\n\r\nbe  exhausted  in the next 25 years.  At  the  moment\r\n\r\nworld  energy  scientists  are  endeavouring  in  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  fields. First, to explore new  sources  of\r\n\r\noil.  Second, to improve nuclear generators  and  the\r\n\r\nsafe disposal of nuclear wastes. Third, to study  and\r\n\r\nobtain  from sea water the heavy hydrogen as fuel  to\r\n\r\ndrive  the  nuclear  energy  generator.  Fourth, to\r\n\r\nresearch  on  converting solar energy  into  electric\r\n\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a country lacking in\r\n\r\nnatural resources. Unlike other countries, we do  not\r\n\r\nhave  hydro-power, coal mines, oil and  other  energy\r\n\r\nresources. But what is important is that as a  result\r\n\r\nof technological and scientific advancement there are\r\n\r\nsome  important natural resources which can  possibly\r\n\r\nbe made use of for man's continued existence, Obvious\r\n\r\nexamples  are  the ocean's resources  and  the  solar\r\n\r\nenergy  resources. Solar energy can  be  better  used\r\n\r\ninstead of going to waste. In my view I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Science and Technology  should\r\n\r\nperhaps undertake research on the conversion of solar\r\n\r\nenergy  into electric energy, thereby inventing  some\r\n\r\nkind  of small scale solar energy electric generator.\r\n\r\nI  lay  stress  on  solar energy, because  it  is  an\r\n\r\ninfinite source of energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  so  geographically situated  near  the\r\n\r\nEquator that out of 365 days per year it has over 300\r\n\r\ndays  of  sunshine, Compared with other countries  in\r\n\r\nthe  West which are not so favourably located, we are\r\n\r\nmuch  better off in our geographical location to make\r\n\r\ngood  use  of  solar  energy, The small  scale  solar\r\n\r\nenergy electric generator I have in mind is in  terms\r\n\r\nof  its  energy  capacity, Such a  generator  can  be\r\n\r\nemployed  on the basis of one generator to one  block\r\n\r\nof  HDB  or urban flats, or you may have a  few  such\r\n\r\ngenerators to serve a whole housing estate,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if such research is carried out\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  it  will  bring  about  the   following\r\n\r\nadvantages.  First, the electricity consumption  will\r\n\r\nbe  reduced year after year. Secondly, our main  form\r\n\r\nof  transport, that is, the motor car, may resort  to\r\n\r\nthe  use of solar energy battery, Electric cars  have\r\n\r\none  disadvantage, and that is, they cannot run  over\r\n\r\nlong   distances  or  at  high  speed.  But  such   a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage is not felt in Singapore because of  the\r\n\r\nlimited  road space and the smallness of our  island.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no need for our motorists to go over  long\r\n\r\ndistances from one city to another or from one  state\r\n\r\nto another. Therefore, electric cars in Singapore are\r\n\r\nuseful.  They  can  be used without the  disadvantage\r\n\r\nthat  may  be found in the larger countries, Thirdly,\r\n\r\nwith solar energy, electricity bill for lighting and'\r\n\r\nair  conditioning  in  offices  and  hotels  will  be\r\n\r\ngreatly reduced. Fourthly, this will also reduce  our\r\n\r\nconsumption of oil. Some people may think that  I  am\r\n\r\nmaking a fantastic proposal on the ground that  since\r\n\r\nWestern  scientists have not been successful in  this\r\n\r\nfield,  how can we ever hope to succeed? To  them,  I\r\n\r\nwill  say  that this is a manifestation of  defeatism\r\n\r\nand that they possess the mentality of a WOG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that the Ministry of Science\r\n\r\nand  Technology  can collect data  and  mobilise  the\r\n\r\nphysicists   and   electrical   engineers   in    our\r\n\r\nuniversities, and  in  our  Government  and   quasi-Government  bodies  for this  kind  of  research.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I am only making this suggestion  for\r\n\r\nthe   reference  of  the  Ministry  of  Science   and\r\n\r\nTechnology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have already pointed out, the\r\n\r\nfantastic  rise  in oil prices has  caused  not  only\r\n\r\neconomic  recession in the West but slowed  down  its\r\n\r\nrecovery.  Future trends will depend on the  recovery\r\n\r\nof  the  economy in the United States. Japan and  the\r\n\r\nnine countries in the EEC, As is generally known, the\r\n\r\nrate  of  economic recovery in the United  States  is\r\n\r\nrather slow, Coupled with the recent increase in  the\r\n\r\nprice  of  oil, the  slow economic  development  has\r\n\r\nalready  got a shadow cast over it. These are factors\r\n\r\nwhich  will have great repercussions on our  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.  Mr Speaker, Sir, henceforth we have to  make\r\n\r\nbetter  use of available economic structure  to  seek\r\n\r\ndevelopment  on a broad basis, As the  President  has\r\n\r\nstated  in  the Addendum on the Ministry of  Finance,\r\n\r\nthe  policy  is to give special help to manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries  and, through  the  Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  to  assist investors who set up new industries\r\n\r\nor  expand  existing  factories  or  industries,  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  also arranging with  the  Development\r\n\r\nBank  of  Singapore  to assist our ship-building  and\r\n\r\nship-repairing  and  labour intensive  industries  in\r\n\r\ntheir development with better facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to be competitive we must achieve\r\n\r\nbetter  quality  and lower costs in our  manufactured\r\n\r\nproducts,  in order to secure a foothold  on  foreign\r\n\r\nmarkets.  So  on a long-term basis, the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour has to seriously study the success factors  of\r\n\r\nthe work system in Japan and South Korea, to find out\r\n\r\nhow   the  workers  there  have  contributed  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of their countries. We must  learn  from\r\n\r\ntheir  experience and fit into our context  the  best\r\n\r\npoints  and good factors so that we will be  able  to\r\n\r\nformulate  a  suitable work system with  the  various\r\n\r\nschemes  of  reward and incentive so as  to  increase\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because of economic pressure,\r\n\r\neconomic protectionism has more and more been adopted\r\n\r\nin   many   Western  countries.  This   is   becoming\r\n\r\nincreasingly  clear. Such a trend is unfavourable  to\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries.  Therefore,  closer   economic\r\n\r\ncooperation  in  developing  countries,  particularly\r\n\r\namong   ASEAN   countries,  is  most  important   and\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nRecently, our country has come into an agreement with\r\n\r\nthe Philippines on an across-the-board 10% tariff cut\r\n\r\nand a partial 10% tariff cut with Thailand, This is a\r\n\r\nstep  forward in the economic cooperation among ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries,  It  is our hope that in the  near  future\r\n\r\nsimilar  agreements can be extended  to  other  ASEAN\r\n\r\npartners,  Mr Speaker, Sir, it is also our hope  that\r\n\r\nthere  will be more multilateral and bilateral  trade\r\n\r\nagreements  among ASEAN countries in order  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout a break-through in the tariff barriers, thereby\r\n\r\nextending  and  expanding trade on a  mutual  benefit\r\n\r\nbasis,  In  this way, the greater the  prosperity  of\r\n\r\nASEAN,  the greater the improvement on the livelihood\r\n\r\nof  the people and thereby the greater the ability of\r\n\r\nASEAN countries to combat the threat of communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to deal with the question of\r\n\r\npersonal relief and earned income relief in  our  tax\r\n\r\nsystem,  Several  Members have raised  this  question\r\n\r\nearlier  and I do not want to repeat their  arguments\r\n\r\nhere,  I  have noted that the present rates of  $2000\r\n\r\nfor  personal  relief  and $1000  for  earned  income\r\n\r\nrelief  were  fixed  as  far  back  as  1948.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore my hope that the Minister for Finance would\r\n\r\nask his officers to calculate on this basis, that is,\r\n\r\nusing 1948 as the base year, what should be the  cost\r\n\r\nof  living  index for 1977. Once this cost of  living\r\n\r\nindex  has  been worked out, then you will  know  how\r\n\r\nunrealistic the present system of tax reliefs can be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the PAP Government is noted for its\r\n\r\nhard  work, efficiency, farsightedness and  fairness.\r\n\r\nThe  so-called fairness means the fairness with which\r\n\r\nthe  Government accords to the people. When inflation\r\n\r\nbrought  about an increase in the cost of production,\r\n\r\nthe  Government raised various taxes and  rates.  The\r\n\r\npeople accepted this. Similarly, since inflation  has\r\n\r\nbrought about an increase in the cost of living,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should correspondingly raise the  personal\r\n\r\nrelief  and earned income relief. Otherwise, it  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  fair,  It will be \"heads I  win,  tails  you\r\n\r\nlose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of taxation again, we have the\r\n\r\npast  experience  of the right hand  giving  out  the\r\n\r\nmoney only to be taken away by the left hand, We have\r\n\r\nnoted, Sir, that in the past when the NWC recommended\r\n\r\nwage increases, they were immediately followed by tax\r\n\r\nincreases  of one kind or another. I am  not  against\r\n\r\ntaxation as such. But I am earnestly suggesting  that\r\n\r\nwhen tax increases are being considered the interests\r\n\r\nof the middle and lower income groups should be taken\r\n\r\ncare  of  so  that we will not give  the  people  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that we are giving away  money  with  the\r\n\r\nright hand and taking it back with the left hand,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally. Sir, I would like to deal with the problem\r\n\r\nof  assisting  old people. As a result of  scientific\r\n\r\nresearch, there have been discoveries and inventions\r\n\r\nin  the  fields of medicine in the form of new  drugs\r\n\r\nand  clinical  instruments.  Besides  there  was  the\r\n\r\nunprecedented economic development accompanied by  an\r\n\r\nimprovement in the livelihood of our people, and  the\r\n\r\nlife   span  of  our  people  in  general  has   also\r\n\r\nincreased, According to statistics, Sir, there are at\r\n\r\npresent  thousands of old people in  Singapore.  This\r\n\r\nfigure will increase from year to year. Those who are\r\n\r\nfortunate may be taken care of by their children, But\r\n\r\nthose  who  are not so fortunate, being  forsaken  by\r\n\r\ntheir  children or senile or widowed,  will  have  to\r\n\r\ndepend  on  public assistance provided by the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Ministry of Health set up a Home\r\n\r\nNursing  Fund  to look after the poor and  needy  old\r\n\r\npeople,  but  this scheme is still  in  its  infancy.\r\n\r\nApart from this, every year we have this exercise  of\r\n\r\ngiving  out  ang pows or gifts to old people  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious constituencies. This is all that we have done\r\n\r\nand  are  doing for the old people or senior citizens\r\n\r\nwho  have  given their best lives to the country  and\r\n\r\nthe society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Sir, the question of old people has\r\n\r\naroused  the attention of the knowledgeables  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety and discussions of their problems have become\r\n\r\nmore  and  more  frequent. But the  problems  of  old\r\n\r\npeople cannot be solved by mere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacademic  discussions.  I feel  that  there  are  two\r\n\r\naspects  to  the problems of the aged.  First, apart\r\n\r\nfrom  food,  there is the need for medical  care  and\r\n\r\nhealthy  recreation. Second, I think we  should  also\r\n\r\ngive  them  some meaning in their lives so that  they\r\n\r\nmay  feel  they are still capable of contributing  to\r\n\r\nour nation and not be a burden to it. The Ministry of\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs,  besides giving  assistance,  should\r\n\r\nlook into the question of what the old people can  do\r\n\r\nto  contribute to society. No doubt, old  people  may\r\n\r\nnot   be  capable  of  high  productivity  but   some\r\n\r\nproductivity   is   definitely   better    than    no\r\n\r\nproductivity.  So we should not allow old  people  to\r\n\r\nsit  down idling and doing nothing. We can find  some\r\n\r\nkind  of  work to keep them occupied and to let  them\r\n\r\nprove  that  they  can do something  useful  for  the\r\n\r\nsociety and the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion moved by the Member for\r\n\r\nUlu Pandan to thank the President for his speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Sir, on a point of clarification.

They have given their mandate  to  us\r\n\r\non the basis of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachievements  from the time we took over  control  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government. However, we should not be complacent\r\n\r\nwith what we have achieved if we are to preserve  our\r\n\r\nrecord  in this House. We should work hard to achieve\r\n\r\nfurther  success or at least to preserve  the  record\r\n\r\nthat  we have achieved, Although we are all from  one\r\n\r\nparty,  this  Parliament is not a  one-party  system.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  choice  of  the  people  through   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentary democracy will not be available if the\r\n\r\ncommunists were to take power, It is clear that the\r\n\r\ncommunists and its allies are the principal enemy of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. We should recapitulate what\r\n\r\nhappened in our country in the past. The communists\r\n\r\nhad tried to take over the trade unions, the student\r\n\r\nunions and also political parties, they failed in\r\n\r\nthe end, We must not forget that the communists, pro-communists and their allies are people who never\r\n\r\ngive up. They will continue to struggle until their\r\n\r\naims are achieved. What is more, with what had\r\n\r\nhappened in Indo-China they will be further\r\n\r\nstrengthened in their effort to work harder. We have\r\n\r\nseen how they tried to influence our intellectuals,\r\n\r\nprofessionals, and students at present. The irony is\r\n\r\nthat during the last elections, a number of\r\n\r\npolitical parties which were known to us before as\r\n\r\nanti-communist parties, unfortunately - consciously\r\n\r\nor unconsciously, they used issues which were once\r\n\r\nused by the pro-communist elements during the\r\n\r\ncolonial days or during our self-government days or\r\n\r\neven after our independence. This is something which\r\n\r\nwe regret because if the result of the last\r\n\r\nelections by way of percentage --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
