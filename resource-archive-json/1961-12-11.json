M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the House will remember that immediately\r\n\r\nbefore  the moment of interruption at our last sitting,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for the Southern Islands mentioned  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse that whilst going through the Estimates (Health),\r\n\r\nhe noted that the provisions under the various items of\r\n\r\nPersonal  Emoluments (Establishment) had  been  reduced\r\n\r\nand  he  wanted confirmation from the Ministry whether,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  any  of  the salaries of the  posts  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry had been reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, all the P.E. items in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth Estimates under Head 25, 26, 27 and 28 have been\r\n\r\ncarefully  scrutinised,  and  I  confirm  that  in   no\r\n\r\ninstance  has  the salary of any grade of officer  been\r\n\r\nreduced.  Where any decrease in the provision  for  any\r\n\r\npost  under P.E. has been reduced, this was due to  one\r\n\r\nof  the  following  reasons. Where a  post  has  become\r\n\r\nvacant  due to retirement, death or resignation  of  an\r\n\r\nincumbent,  provision is made at  the  minimum  of  the\r\n\r\nsalary scale for the post. Secondly, where officers are\r\n\r\ntransferred - in  some cases, more senior  officers  have\r\n\r\nbeen  promoted or transferred out of a department - they\r\n\r\nhave  been  replaced by more junior officers.  In  this\r\n\r\ncase,  the  provision is reduced. Only in one case - that\r\n\r\nof  the religious sisters at the Mandalay Road Hospital\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- has the total provision for their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsalaries  been  reduced  because  they  used  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nexpatriate terms and they have been placed on terms and\r\n\r\nconditions of service applicable to local officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will also remember that the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill wanted to know why the provision for  Matrons\r\n\r\n(Grade  II) has been increased from $15,600 to  $18,000\r\n\r\nat  the  Tan  Tock  Seng Hospital.  He  suggested  that\r\n\r\npossibly they got a very big bump up in salary. That is\r\n\r\nnot so, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Who said that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> In 1961, the post of Matron, Grade I, was\r\n\r\nvacant and one of the Grade II Matrons was held against\r\n\r\nthat vacant Grade I post. In the provision for the  two\r\n\r\nGrade II posts, the Treasury took that into account, so\r\n\r\nthat  in the case of the Grade II posts, provision  was\r\n\r\nentered  at the minimum of the salary scale,  that  is,\r\n\r\n$550  a  month for 12 months, which is $6,600  for  one\r\n\r\nGrade II post and the full salary on the maximum of the\r\n\r\nscale  i.e. $750 a month for the other Grade  II  post,\r\n\r\nmaking  a  total  provision  of  $15,600-$9,000   plus\r\n\r\n$6,600.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Estimates for this year, we are making\r\n\r\nprovision  for these two Grade II posts at the  maximum\r\n\r\nof  the  salary scale for Matrons (Grade II), which  is\r\n\r\n$750  per  month. Hence the entry for the provision  of\r\n\r\n$18,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a question was also\r\n\r\nasked why it was\r\n\r\nthat  the  provision for the salary  of  the  Grade  II\r\n\r\nMatron at the Thomson Road Hospital remained at $7,800.\r\n\r\nThe  hon. Member wanted to know why this Matron did not\r\n\r\nreceive  any  increments in salary. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  post  has  always  been  vacant  and  when  these\r\n\r\nEstimates were prepared, the post was entered at a mean\r\n\r\nsalary of $650 a month. The scale for Matron (Grade II)\r\n\r\nis the scale of $550x25A-750. On the basis of this mean\r\n\r\nsalary, the provision entered was $7,800. It was $7,800\r\n\r\nfor 1961 and it is also $7,800 for 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have explained this to the satisfaction of\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><div align=\"center\"><b>AND DEVELOPMENT</b></div></b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ESTIMATES FOR 1962</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee of\r\n\r\nSupply [3rd Allotted Day].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAIN ESTIMATES, 1962 (Cont.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 27 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on Public Health Division\r\n\r\ncommencing at page 276 of the Main Estimates.

Sir, as  far\r\n\r\nas the two Senior Registrars are concerned (that is to\r\n\r\nsay,  the  two Health Officers promoted to  he  Senior\r\n\r\nRegistrars),  this  increase  of  $250  a   month   is\r\n\r\naccounted for. But can the Minister please explain how\r\n\r\nit is that all the remaining ten Health Officers based\r\n\r\non  the  figures before us are each going  to  get  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  $250 a month, whereas according  to  the\r\n\r\nsalary scale the increase is only $35 a month?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum to be allocated for Head 27 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of item (174) of subhead 1.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The debate may range over item (175)*.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Amendment (3) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 27 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of\r\n\r\nitem (175) of subhead 1.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the matter is very\r\n\r\nsimply  explained  as  follows. There  are  57  Public\r\n\r\nHealth  medical officers, and 12 of them  are  in  the\r\n\r\nSchool Health Section. Out of these 12 posts of School\r\n\r\nHealth  Officers,  it is proposed to  upgrade  two  of\r\n\r\nthese  posts to Senior Registrar level, the  other  10\r\n\r\nposts remaining at timescale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason for this increase is\r\n\r\nthat  more  senior  officers with salaries  above  the\r\n\r\nsecond  segment  of the timescale  have  come  to  the\r\n\r\nSchool  Health Section, and more junior officers  have\r\n\r\nbeen  posted out. That is why there is this  increase.\r\n\r\nTo  simple  minds, it appears rather  ridiculous  that\r\n\r\nthere  should be an increase of $37,000 when all  that\r\n\r\nis  done  is to upgrade two posts to Senior  Registrar\r\n\r\nlevel. In point of fact, there have been transfers out\r\n\r\nof  the  School Health Section of more junior officers\r\n\r\nand  the bringing in of more senior officers from  the\r\n\r\npublic  health  service, who are above the  efficiency\r\n\r\nbar,  into the School Health Section.

From  what  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nexplained, there are some health officers who  are  on\r\n\r\nthe  higher  timescale, but according to  the  figures\r\n\r\nhere every officer is on the higher timescale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No Mr Speaker, Sir.

I  do  not know what is the policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment as regards markets and hawkers in  this\r\n\r\ncity.  It seems that they are very much at  large,\r\n\r\nwithout  any  proper regulations  being  enforced.\r\n\r\nMost of them put up stalls along public roads  and\r\n\r\nit  can  be said that they are a danger to  public\r\n\r\nhealth and traffic, to the detriment of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we consider the hawkers provide a means\r\n\r\nof livelihood for the people, nevertheless, a loss\r\n\r\nis  caused  to some business sections,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  shops  that have to pay rents and  licences\r\n\r\naccording to law. With these hawkers at large - they\r\n\r\ndo   not   obey  any  regulations - some  of   the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers  have had to close down because  their\r\n\r\nbusiness was overrun by these hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems that the Government have no\r\n\r\ndefinite  plan  to carry out in respect  of  these\r\n\r\nhawkers. Probably they fear that the hawkers would\r\n\r\npossibly  not  support  them.  This  problem,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  is  rampant  at  the  moment.  The\r\n\r\ninterests of the public should be looked into.  If\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government were not in  power  today,\r\n\r\nthen  whichever government that replaces it  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  face this big problem. And it is  a  big\r\n\r\nproblem indeed, because of the lack of enforcement\r\n\r\nof the regulations. Some\r\n\r\nquarters  feel rather reluctant to bring  up  this\r\n\r\nproblem to the Assembly because they fear the  bad\r\n\r\neffects that might come from the hawkers. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  get  the Government to view this  matter\r\n\r\nwith  grave concern, and it should be done in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of public health and for the good of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It would appear that the item\r\n\r\nopens itself to a debate on the hawker problem.

But what I can tell this House is that\r\n\r\ntoday in the city area there are 1,222 standpipes, and\r\n\r\nin  the  rural  area there are 1,126 standpipes.

These requests are submitted  for\r\n\r\nthe views of the relevant departments, principally the\r\n\r\nHealth and Water Department. The Land Office also come\r\n\r\ninto  this.

This is the\r\n\r\ncorrect  estimate  for  3 Legal Officers  at  $2,500  a\r\n\r\nmonth.  But  for  1962, the amount asked  for  is  only\r\n\r\n$60,000.   The   \"Notes\"  show   these   words,   \"Part\r\n\r\nProvision\".  Do  we  or  do we  not  have  three  legal\r\n\r\nofficers?  If we do not have them, do we or do  we  not\r\n\r\nwant  them?  And herein lies the answer  to  the  \"Part\r\n\r\nProvision\".  If we want three legal officers,  then  it\r\n\r\nhas  to  be full provision. If full provision for  1961\r\n\r\nwas  made, has there now been a change in the minds  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  that they could not  get  three  legal\r\n\r\nofficers  and  that they could only get  two?  If  they\r\n\r\ncould  only  get two legal officers, then  they  should\r\n\r\nprovide  for two and not put in three and put in  \"Part\r\n\r\nProvision\" for only two legal officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the intention is to\r\n\r\nrecruit  legal officers who have special qualifications\r\n\r\nin  legal drafting, criminal law, prosecution and civil\r\n\r\nwork,  especially revenue cases, to assist in the  work\r\n\r\nof  the State Advocate-General's Chambers and to  train\r\n\r\nthe young legal officers in service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts have been made to recruit in the United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  Australia  and Canada,  but  so  far  without\r\n\r\nsuccess.

Mr Speaker, Sir, for the  present,\r\n\r\nlegal  aid  is  not being extended to  criminal  cases.\r\n\r\nLegal  aid is granted only in civil cases. Should there\r\n\r\nbe  representations from the public and should the  Bar\r\n\r\nsupport  the extension of legal aid to criminal  cases,\r\n\r\nthen  I  agree the time would be opportune to take  the\r\n\r\nLegal  Aid  Department out of the control of the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General's Chambers. But for  the  present,  as\r\n\r\nthere are knotty legal problems that arise in the Legal\r\n\r\nAid  Department,  it  would be of  assistance  if  this\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  kept  under the control  of  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General.

We\r\n\r\nwarned them about such a situation developing. They pooh-poohed the idea. What was worse, they came along and put\r\n\r\nup  a  very bold front and defended a man who, it seems,\r\n\r\nbecause he is no longer with them, has been described as\r\n\r\na Communist and a person who was put into a job where he\r\n\r\ncould  do  no  harm. Do we use public  funds  to  put  a\r\n\r\ncomrade into a job where he could do no harm or where he\r\n\r\ncould  do  at least some good for the money he  received\r\n\r\nfrom the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Surely, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  does  not  expect me to  denounce  my  former\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary  before there  was  an  open  fight\r\n\r\nbetween  us.  Surely  you do not expect  us  to  do  so?\r\n\r\n[Interruption] I mean, you have to shoot a line now  and\r\n\r\nthen, but it was obvious at that time that a defence had\r\n\r\nto be made and face had to be saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the work that he did in my Ministry, I\r\n\r\nhave  said  that I did try to arrange an assignment  for\r\n\r\nhim  with  Seamen's  Registry Board  to  find  work  for\r\n\r\nunemployed  seamen. We tried to improve the  working  of\r\n\r\nthat  particular section of the Government, it was quite\r\n\r\nan   urgent  task  and  I  thought  the  then  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary would be a good person. He knows the  workers.\r\n\r\nHe  may not specialise in seamen, but he certainly knows\r\n\r\nthe  general problems of workers and he could get useful\r\n\r\nideas  from  seamen as to how the Ordinance  could  best\r\n\r\nserve their interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately my former Political Secretary thought I\r\n\r\nwas  setting  a  trap  for him and firmly  declined  the\r\n\r\noffer,  after which, of course, nothing could  be  done.\r\n\r\nMind   you,   I   had  an  idea  of  giving   him   some\r\n\r\nresponsibility - rather tedious, of course, but  it  would\r\n\r\noccupy his attention eight hours a day. Once a year, the\r\n\r\nAuditor scrutinises the accounts of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall   Government   departments  and   lists   out   the\r\n\r\nmisdemeanours  or inaccuracies or malpractices  in  the\r\n\r\naccounting  procedures - a very long  list - mostly  over\r\n\r\nsmall things, like lost stamps, stationery not properly\r\n\r\naccounted  for, etc. He would then make recommendations\r\n\r\nfor improvements in these departments. I toyed with the\r\n\r\nidea  of  asking my Political Secretary  to  look  into\r\n\r\nthis,  thereby  contributing to the efficiency  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But  after he had refused point-blank  the\r\n\r\nappointment of Chairman to the Seamen's Registry Board,\r\n\r\nI  thought  it  rather pointless to  proceed  with  the\r\n\r\nsubject.  Sir,  I  can assure you that everything  that\r\n\r\ncould have been done or could have been thought of  was\r\n\r\ndone or was thought of, but if the result was so meagre\r\n\r\nand  the  effort he put in did not justify the sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney  paid  to  him, then I suggest that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Backbenchers are the persons to  put  forward\r\n\r\nthe facts on behalf of their Secretary-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance  said  just  now  that  his\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary and his Party had never seen eye to\r\n\r\neye with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Prime Minister was asked to explain the\r\n\r\nnecessity for a Political Secretary, he said  that  the\r\n\r\njob  of  a  Political  Secretary  was  to  explain  the\r\n\r\npolicies  of the Government to the public. In  view  of\r\n\r\nwhat  the Minister for Finance said, how did the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister accept a man who could not see eye to eye with\r\n\r\nhim  and how, since this person did not agree with  the\r\n\r\npolicies  of the Government, could he explain  them  to\r\n\r\nthe  public?

This   is   not\r\n\r\nsomething  that  is  strange  to  the  P.A.P. type  of\r\n\r\nthinking.  What they want is to use the services  of  a\r\n\r\nman  so as to continue to get the support of the people\r\n\r\nwhose support they expect to get, but at the same  time\r\n\r\nkeep him at a safe distance so that he does no harm to\r\n\r\nthe  political  leadership of the Party.  But  I  think\r\n\r\ninsofar  as  the Political Secretary was concerned,  he\r\n\r\nwas  not  afraid of taking up the chairmanship  of  the\r\n\r\nSeamen's  Registry  Board or of  taking  up  any  other\r\n\r\nassignment for the reason that he was never  afraid  to\r\n\r\nhold responsibility. But unfortunately, in the thinking\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. Ministers, they always make sure that  a\r\n\r\nperson is given responsibility but that he is not given\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility to have a say in the policies  that\r\n\r\nhe  is  supposed  to execute. These are  two  different\r\n\r\nthings.  If you appoint so and so to carry out policies\r\n\r\nin  regard  to seamen, you must give him the  right  to\r\n\r\nhave  a say in the formulation of those policies.  This\r\n\r\nis  a  distinction that I want to make. I can say quite\r\n\r\nsafely  that  not  only  was this  the  case  with  the\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary to the Minister for  Finance,  but\r\n\r\nalso with the Political Secretaries to the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Law and the Minister for Health. Therefore,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  want to get this understood properly, that  if\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries were paid $1,100 a month and they\r\n\r\nwere  not  doing the work deserving of such a sum,  the\r\n\r\nblame should not be put on the Political Secretaries as\r\n\r\nsuch  but  on the Government Frontbenchers  fairly  and\r\n\r\nsquarely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nregarding the Political Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance, the Minister for Finance brought out two\r\n\r\npoints. I would like to clarify the second point he\r\n\r\ntouched on. Regarding the checking of stores in the\r\n\r\nvarious departments, I was directed by the Minister at\r\n\r\nthat time to discuss it with the Political Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe Minister was suspicious and I was directed to tell\r\n\r\nthe Political Secretary to check all the departmental\r\n\r\nstores except those of the Police and the Civil\r\n\r\nDefence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if a Minister is so suspicious of\r\n\r\nhis colleague's work, you can then expect the colleague\r\n\r\nto adopt a similar attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I might add a little, Sir. When the\r\n\r\njob  of  Chairman  of the Seamen's Registry  Board  was\r\n\r\noffered to Mr Lim Ching Siong, there were ulterior and\r\n\r\nnefarious  motives behind it. The previous Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  Seamen's Registry Board was Mr G. H. Kiat and  he\r\n\r\nwas  chased  around. He was almost hammered because  he\r\n\r\ncould  not  cope with the job and the seamen wanted  to\r\n\r\nmake  somebody a scapegoat. The Minister thinking  that\r\n\r\nthis  was a tough job assigned it particularly  to  Mr\r\n\r\nLim Ching Siong hoping thereby that Mr Lim Ching Siong\r\n\r\nwould  become unpopular. The Minister, of course,  also\r\n\r\nhoped  that the seamen would be as rough with  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong as they were with Mr G. H. Kiat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this really takes the cake - all\r\n\r\nthis  just  on suspicion without any proof  whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for Thomson said that it was not  fair  to\r\n\r\nhave  given this assignment to young Master Lim because\r\n\r\nhe would have been given the responsibility without any\r\n\r\nauthority to participate in decision making.  Sir,  how\r\n\r\ndoes he know? The man never took on the job. If he  had\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  on  the  job and had  found  that  he  had\r\n\r\ninadequate powers, that he was not consulted  and  that\r\n\r\nhis  views  on  the  policies of  the  Government  were\r\n\r\nignored,  then  I  think there  would  have  been  some\r\n\r\njustification for what the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid. But that never took place. The Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nwas just expressing the suspicions which he felt and no\r\n\r\ndoubt   the   suspicions  which  my  former   Political\r\n\r\nSecretary also felt. But if he thought that he would be\r\n\r\ngiven  a  job  to  do but that he was not  to  be  consulted, that matter could have been raised with me. We\r\n\r\ncould  have come to an understanding. If I had in  fact\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"You are there in the position of a minion.  You\r\n\r\njust  take  orders from me and do not tell me  what  to\r\n\r\ndo,\"  then  I  say  he  would have  been  justified  in\r\n\r\nrefusing the assignment. But that never was the case. I\r\n\r\nsay  with  respect  that  the Member  for  Thomson  was\r\n\r\ntalking nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Queenstown said that it was a\r\n\r\ntough  job.  I  agree that it was so and  therefore  we\r\n\r\nselected  a tough man for a tough job. The Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  thought  his  Secretary-General\r\n\r\ncould  not cope with a tough job. But I can assure  you\r\n\r\nthat  I have more confidence in the ability of Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nto handle this job and I say that he could have done it\r\n\r\nquite  satisfactorily. He might suspect that I may  set\r\n\r\nbooby traps - that is another matter. I did not say  that\r\n\r\nhe  refused the assignment because he suspected us.  He\r\n\r\nrefused it because he thought we were going to  do  him\r\n\r\nin.  I have just got proof from a colleague of his that\r\n\r\nthat was the case. So how can we trust this fellow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what the former Parliamentary Secretary said, I\r\n\r\ncannot recall whether I asked him to discuss this  with\r\n\r\nthe  Political Secretary, but I did discuss the general\r\n\r\nproposition with my Parliamentary Secretary and  I  did\r\n\r\nsay  that there were a few sensitive departments  which\r\n\r\nthe  Political Secretary could do well to avoid.  There\r\n\r\nwas  nothing wrong with that. Everybody knows that  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  is  a  great security risk. Why try to  bluff  and\r\n\r\npretend  that it is otherwise? He is not going anywhere\r\n\r\nnear  the  Police - civil defence is  unimportant  as  it\r\n\r\nconcerns   ladders,   buckets,   etc. - nor   the    Army\r\n\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I would like to say just one little\r\n\r\nsentence.

I do not want to go into\r\n\r\ngreat details and expound on the importance of the\r\n\r\nduties involved, as this was done, I think, by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance last year, and also by various\r\n\r\nother Ministers every time the debate centres around\r\n\r\nthe Political Study Centre. But it is very curious,\r\n\r\nSir, that, on the one hand, we find the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Culture and other key personnel in the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

But whereas the holder\r\n\r\nof  this  post, the Head of the Political Study Centre,\r\n\r\nis a man who is in a position to influence the thinking\r\n\r\nof  a  very  important section of our  population - the\r\n\r\ncivil  service. It seems to me very odd that this  man,\r\n\r\nwhom the Prime Minister once described as an expatriate\r\n\r\nand   who  wrote  the  speeches  of  the  former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  is made use of to impart political knowledge\r\n\r\nto  the civil service. I do not know if it is true, but\r\n\r\nthere is a rumour round town that it may be that Mr G.\r\n\r\nG.

Of course,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nsuch  blatant  lessons that are taught in school  where\r\n\r\nyou say, \"You must do this. You must do that.\" No civil\r\n\r\nservant has been told that you must join the P.A.P.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse  not.  But  just to explain what  I  mean.  This\r\n\r\nlittle   story  is  very  short  and  will   give   the\r\n\r\nexplanation better than a lot of words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read in a magazine that a little girl came home\r\n\r\nfrom school and asked her mother, \"Mummy, why don't  we\r\n\r\ngo  to Russia?\" So the mother said, \"Russia! What for?\"\r\n\r\nAnd  the  girl said. \"The grass there is green.  People\r\n\r\nare  happy, and food is plentiful.\" She was painting  a\r\n\r\nvery  colourful  picture  of Russia.  Then  the  mother\r\n\r\nasked,  \"Who  has  been  telling  you  all  this?\"  She\r\n\r\nreplied,  \"Teacher.\"  There  you  are,  Sir,  you   can\r\n\r\ninstigate  a  child to love Russia, to want  to  go  to\r\n\r\nRussia,  to think well of Russia, without telling  her,\r\n\r\n\"Russia  is  good.  You tell mummy to  go  to  Russia.\"\r\n\r\nThings  like that are supposed to be going  on  in  the\r\n\r\nPolitical Study Centre. So to ease the public mind, may\r\n\r\nI  ask the Government to tell us what are their aims in\r\n\r\nrunning  the Political Study Centre? What do they  hope\r\n\r\nto  achieve?  What  has been achieved?  What  is  being\r\n\r\ntaught  there?  Which  groups  of  civil  servants  are\r\n\r\neligible to attend? Is the syllabus today the  same  as\r\n\r\nthat   when   they  first  started  the   course?   Are\r\n\r\nAssemblymen, if they wish, entitled to join the  course\r\n\r\nand  sit  with the civil servants - not a special  course\r\n\r\nfor  us,  Sir,  but to sit with the civil  servants  at\r\n\r\ntheir  course? I shall be obliged if the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance could tell us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Opposition really cannot\r\n\r\nhave it both ways. One Member says that teachers having\r\n\r\nattended the Political Study Centre tell their children\r\n\r\nthat  the  grass is green in Russia, everyone is  happy\r\n\r\nand  why  not go there? If this were the fact,  then  I\r\n\r\nexpect   the   Barisan  Sosialis  would  be  completely\r\n\r\noverjoyed and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  not  raise a word against Mr G. G. Thomson.  Far\r\n\r\nfrom  requiring him to leave the post, they  might  even\r\n\r\nsuggest,  instead of deducting $10, to add  $10  to  the\r\n\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest that when the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nwas more than hinting that Mr Thomson was an M15 agent,\r\n\r\nhe  was  steering pretty close to libellous slander,  and\r\n\r\nthat  if he were to repeat such a statement outside this\r\n\r\nChamber, perhaps he might take his chances. Be  that  as\r\n\r\nit may, I would first like to give a few facts about the\r\n\r\nCentre,  the  sort  of  details  that  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten asked for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First: who goes there? The answer is the civil\r\n\r\nservants.  We started the course nearly two  years  ago.\r\n\r\nFor the first 18 months or so we required all Division I\r\n\r\nofficers, except those in purely technical jobs such  as\r\n\r\ndoctors,  engineers, and people who have nothing  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  policy making, to attend this course.  As  regards\r\n\r\nthe syllabus, the main outline of it was drawn up by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture, and the details were filled in  by\r\n\r\nthe  Director  and  myself,  in  consultation  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  I  think the Minister for Culture  is  better\r\n\r\nqualified  than  I am to describe the  contents  of  the\r\n\r\ncourse. The course itself lasts some two to three weeks.\r\n\r\nCivil servants go there every afternoon for a period  of\r\n\r\nabout  two  to  three  weeks. That  is  for  Division  I\r\n\r\nofficers. When nearly all of them had gone through  this\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  started  with Division  II  officers,  i.e.\r\n\r\nExecutive  Officers, certain types of  teachers  and,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  principals  went there: also police  inspectors,\r\n\r\nand so on. For them the Study Centre organised a briefer\r\n\r\ncourse  of about, I think, ten days. I forgot the actual\r\n\r\nperiod,  but  it was about ten days. It  was  a  simpler\r\n\r\ncourse,  although it contained all the elements  of  the\r\n\r\nmain course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, I will leave it to the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nto  give an account of the syllabus and contents of  the\r\n\r\ncourse.  But  perhaps I may say a  few  words  why  this\r\n\r\ncourse  is  necessary and what we  hope  to  achieve  by\r\n\r\nestablishing it and running it for the civil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservants. First, Sir, what the course does not  want  to\r\n\r\nachieve.  It is not designed to tell the civil  servants\r\n\r\nor  to convince them of the P.A.P. point of view. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  even  set  up to convince the civil  servants  that\r\n\r\nsocialism  is  a good thing, because the  civil  service\r\n\r\nmust be neutral and it is not for the Party in power  to\r\n\r\ntell  the  civil  service  that  they  must  accept  one\r\n\r\npolitical  philosophy, be it socialism or  Communism  or\r\n\r\nliberalism or any other ism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not our responsibility. No political\r\n\r\nleadership  would  be right in propagating  a  political\r\n\r\nparty  philosophy  to the civil service.  The  Political\r\n\r\nStudy Centre never did that. This, of course, has caused\r\n\r\nsome unhappiness among the Barisan Sosialis Members, and\r\n\r\neven among others, because they say, well, there is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Political  Study  Centre.  They  must   tell\r\n\r\neveryone  in the civil service what a socialist  society\r\n\r\nis  and  what they have to do to bring it about.  If  we\r\n\r\nwere  to  do  that,  then I say we  would  fail  in  our\r\n\r\nobjective. When we come to senior civil servants, we are\r\n\r\nnot  talking  to duffers. All of them have gone  through\r\n\r\nthe  discipline of a university or higher education  and\r\n\r\nthey  are  not going to say, \"Yes. You tell me.  I  must\r\n\r\nbelieve   it.  Therefore,  I  believe  it.\"   They   can\r\n\r\ndistinguish between an honest attempt to explain to them\r\n\r\nthe  political  history of the Asian  revolution  and  a\r\n\r\ndishonest  attempt  to force on them a  party  political\r\n\r\nphilosophy.  Therefore, if the proposition is  that  the\r\n\r\nPolitical  Study  Centre should tell the  civil  service\r\n\r\nthings  that  they  have  never  learnt  by  experience,\r\n\r\nbecause as civil servants they have led a sheltered  and\r\n\r\nisolated way of life, then it is necessary to tell  them\r\n\r\nthe  struggle that goes on outside the civil service -\r\n\r\nthe  great  revolution  for  national  freedom  that  is\r\n\r\nsurging through Asia since World War I. That surely  can\r\n\r\nbe  told  in dispassionate historical terms.  There  are\r\n\r\nbooks about it, books written by persons of all types of\r\n\r\npolitical  persuasion. Then more recently, we  have  our\r\n\r\nown experience in Singapore and Malaya. The struggle  of\r\n\r\nthe Malayan Communist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParty since 1945 to achieve political dominance in this\r\n\r\ncountry; the history of the armed insurrection in 1948.\r\n\r\nThese  facts  again are known from newspaper  articles,\r\n\r\nfrom men on the spot. Here again it is just a matter of\r\n\r\ngetting  the person who has the training and background\r\n\r\nfor  political  analysis, a person who has  discipline,\r\n\r\nsay,  in  certain lines of academic pursuit. More  than\r\n\r\nthat  I  say the Political Study Centre is not required\r\n\r\nto do. It is not the business of the Centre to turn out\r\n\r\ngreat  anti-colonial patriots. That is not the business\r\n\r\nof  the  Political  Study Centre.  We  tell  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  \"Look,  there is a revolution  going  on  in\r\n\r\nAsia. We are having the effect of the backwash of  this\r\n\r\nrevolution, Trace the history of this Asian  revolution\r\n\r\nfrom the 19th century onwards.\" Strange as it may seem,\r\n\r\nuntil  barely  two years ago, the general  run  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated,  both inside and  outside  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice,  were  quite unaware of these things,  because\r\n\r\ntheir   attitude   was  that  politics   is   something\r\n\r\ndangerous; it is better not to dabble or indulge in it -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

The English-educated,\r\n\r\nuntil about two years ago, both inside and outside  the\r\n\r\ncivil service, were unaware of these events. They  knew\r\n\r\nthat  something  was  taking place.  They  were  rather\r\n\r\ndisturbed about it. Many were really alarmed. Some  had\r\n\r\nviews and theories about how it happened and how it was\r\n\r\ngoing to work out. But there was never any occasion for\r\n\r\nthem to make a serious study of these problems, to read\r\n\r\nbooks,  to  listen to lectures and to hold  discussions\r\n\r\namongst themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  was  the  main  purpose of  the  Political  Study\r\n\r\nCentre. It was a Centre run by civil servants for civil\r\n\r\nservants with the purpose of bringing home to them some\r\n\r\nof  the  major political problems of the  day.  But  in\r\n\r\norder   to  equip  them  to  understand  the  immediate\r\n\r\nproblems facing the country, it was necessary  to  give\r\n\r\nthem  this back-ground of history regarding this whole\r\n\r\nbusiness  as  a long historical process  which  is  now\r\n\r\ntaking  firm shape in the independent nations  in  Asia\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Members want further details of the contents\r\n\r\nof  the course. My colleague, the Minister for Culture,\r\n\r\nwould be only too happy to oblige.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there\r\n\r\nare two issues on this subject. The first is the holder\r\n\r\nof  the  post of Mr G. G. Thomson: the second concerns\r\n\r\nthe  question of the Political Study Centre itself.  On\r\n\r\nthe  first issue, on Mr Thomson, I think this  subject\r\n\r\nhas been discussed and fought many times in the Central\r\n\r\nCommittee of the P.A.P. from August 1959 until now.  We\r\n\r\nwere glad to hear what the Member for Thomson said just\r\n\r\nnow,  that Mr Thomson is sailing back to his  homeland\r\n\r\nnext month. If the Minister can give us a guarantee and\r\n\r\nan  assurance, we will not hammer him on that issue. We\r\n\r\nknow  what  Mr  Thomson is. It  is  contained  in  the\r\n\r\nHansard. It is contained in the minutes of the  Central\r\n\r\nCommittee. It is contained in the Hong Lim Resolutions.\r\n\r\nIt  is  contained  in  the Hong  Lim  by-election  mass\r\n\r\nmeetings.  And so we will not spend much  time  on  the\r\n\r\nperson of Mr Thomson himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second issue, my view is that during its two\r\n\r\nand  a  half  years of existence, the  Political  Study\r\n\r\nCentre has served no useful purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nobody asked you to talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Because what they were doing is to\r\n\r\nget an expatriate to teach our own Assemblymen, our own\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  about  the  conditions  in  Asia,  the\r\n\r\nnational and social currents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich are steering Asia. Mr Speaker, Sir, with all due\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  am sure an expatriate is not qualified  to\r\n\r\nteach  us that. Of course, as far as I know, we have  a\r\n\r\nfew Asian tutors, both full-time and part-time, who are\r\n\r\nhelping in the job.

May I point out first  that  the\r\n\r\ncourses  which  are  being run in the  Political  Study\r\n\r\nCentre were sanctioned before they could be given by  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of people who included myself, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  and, in case there should be any  doubt  about\r\n\r\nthis, also Mr Woodhull and Mr Puthucheary, who by  no\r\n\r\nstretch  of  the imagination of the Barisan,  could  be\r\n\r\nconstrued as colonialists or stooges. I can assure  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Opposition that the contents  of  the\r\n\r\ncourse  are not directed towards making comparisons  of\r\n\r\nany  particular  political Party in  this  Assembly  or\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the Assembly. In fact, it  is  one  of  my\r\n\r\nduties to go there once a fortnight, or sometimes twice\r\n\r\na  fortnight,  and very often people do  ask  questions\r\n\r\nwhere  they pin-point either a particular leader  or  a\r\n\r\nparticular  political Party. Because of the  allegation\r\n\r\nmade right from the start that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit is a brain-washing centre, we take great care, where\r\n\r\nwe  can,  to  avoid  making political  capital  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense of one Party or the other. But very often it is\r\n\r\ntrue that in the course of discussion civil servants do\r\n\r\nbring  out certain comparisons. And I am sorry to  say,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Member for Hong Lim features very  often  in\r\n\r\nthese  comparisons where the civil servants  regale  us\r\n\r\nwith  rather  heart-rending stories  of  what  happened\r\n\r\nunder the regime of the Mayor of the City Council or of\r\n\r\nthe  previous  Minister for National  Development.  But\r\n\r\neven  then sometimes it is difficult to avoid answering\r\n\r\nthem  because we have to exonerate the Government. Very\r\n\r\noften  we do say that we do not want to go out  of  our\r\n\r\nway  to discuss the merits of any individual politician\r\n\r\nor   any  particular  political  Party.  That  can   be\r\n\r\ntestified to by going to any of the civil servants.  If\r\n\r\nthere  had been any specific instance of the Government\r\n\r\nmaking  political capital out of these  courses,  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  sure those instances would have been transmitted\r\n\r\nto   some  Member  of  the  Opposition.  But  in  these\r\n\r\nallegations,  so far nobody has mentioned any  specific\r\n\r\ninstance. It is quite true that in the course of a long\r\n\r\ndiscussion,  you may occasionally say something  in  an\r\n\r\noffguarded  moment. But not as a matter  of  principle.\r\n\r\nNone  of the courses are designed to put any particular\r\n\r\npolitical  Party  at  a  disadvantage.  Some   of   the\r\n\r\nlecturers who go there and give lectures are  not  pro-P.A.P.  Some of them are even suspected of being  anti-P.A.P. There have been foreign correspondents who  have\r\n\r\nlectured there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will indicate roughly what the nature of the\r\n\r\ncourses  is.  It is true the courses have changed  from\r\n\r\ntime to time. But generally they come broadly into  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  categories. First, the  history  of  Malayan\r\n\r\npolitical Parties -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Point of order.

Is it necessary for the Minister for Culture to\r\n\r\nrepeat what his colleague has said?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am not quite certain whether the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture is, in fact, repeating. If  he  is\r\n\r\nrepeating,  perhaps  he should  not.  He  should  avoid\r\n\r\nrepeating what the Minister for Finance has said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think it was the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  or  the Member for Mountbatten who  wanted  to\r\n\r\nknow  what  exactly are the contents of these  courses.\r\n\r\nSir, I am trying to indicate in more detail, where  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has only dealt generally with, the\r\n\r\nnature of the courses which are being run there. One is\r\n\r\nthe  history  of the political Parties, which  includes\r\n\r\nthe  M.C.P., U.M.N.O., and even the M.D.U.,  which  was\r\n\r\nmentioned  by the Member for Queenstown.  It  is  quite\r\n\r\ntrue,   Sir,  that  as  a  non-Communist  party,   some\r\n\r\nlecturers do tell things about the M.C.P. which may not\r\n\r\nbe  to  the liking of certain Members, perhaps to  the\r\n\r\nBarisan.  But  that is not a secret.  It  was  never  a\r\n\r\nsecret  when they were on this side of the House.  They\r\n\r\nwere non-Communists. We do not believe in Communism. To\r\n\r\nthat extent, it is necessary for civil servants who are\r\n\r\nrunning the civil service to know the nature of one  of\r\n\r\nthe  political forces, with which they have to contend,\r\n\r\nand  their method of operation. In fact, the Member for\r\n\r\nHong Lim indicated earlier that Mr Gerald de Cruz, who\r\n\r\nwas  formally  active in the Communist  movement  here,\r\n\r\ndoes give the civil servants a first-hand knowledge  of\r\n\r\nhow  these people operate and what they do. The  Member\r\n\r\nalso  mentioned Mr James Puthucheary, who  is  now  an\r\n\r\nadviser and a luminary in the Barisan Sosialis and  who\r\n\r\nhas  also said many things about the Communists and the\r\n\r\nCommunist  movement. Perhaps, Sir, if at some  time  in\r\n\r\nthe remote future Chin Peng does come out of the jungle\r\n\r\nand decides that he has enough of it, we are quite sure\r\n\r\nwe  will  invite him to the Political Study  Centre  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  firsthand  account  of  what  he  thinks   of\r\n\r\nCommunism. By and large this is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngeneral nature of the courses. Then we have lectures on\r\n\r\nAsia,  the Asian revolution, economic problems, Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalism,    Malayan   culture,   and    talks    by\r\n\r\ncorrespondents on current topics:\r\n\r\nwhat is happening in Laos, China and elsewhere. This is\r\n\r\nthe  broad structure of the courses, and from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime a specific subject is changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as the lecturer is concerned, it is quite\r\n\r\ntrue,  Sir, that we have tried very hard to get a local\r\n\r\nman  who can run these courses. The moment we can  find\r\n\r\nsuch  a man, we shall certainly see to it that the post\r\n\r\nis   filled.   Mr   Thomson  only  carries   out   our\r\n\r\ninstructions  as regards the contents  of  the  courses\r\n\r\nwhich are dictated to him by us. He is a technician and\r\n\r\nhe  arranges the courses. He delivers what  has  to  be\r\n\r\nsaid on our instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I will say this, Sir. I was not hiding the\r\n\r\nfact  that Mr Woodhull and Mr James Puthucheary  also\r\n\r\ngave   lectures   to   the  civil  service.   But   the\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction over Mr C. G. Thomson is not  new.  It\r\n\r\nhas not come about just now. As the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nhas  pointed out, all of us in the P.A.P. knew who  Mr\r\n\r\nThomson  was. I have told the Prime Minister personally\r\n\r\nand  privately what I thought of Mr G. G. Thomson, and\r\n\r\nso  have  Mr Puthucheary and Mr Woodhull. Can  I  beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw now, Sir, unless there is -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member can always beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw, but he has made a speech. Another Member  may\r\n\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government\r\n\r\nhave  said  that the courses at the Centre are  not  to\r\n\r\npromote  P.A.P.ism, which is what I intended  to  point\r\n\r\nout  when I said, that in Russia the grass is green.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  accuse the Government of running a  course  to\r\n\r\npromote  Communism, but rather P.A.P.ism. But,  anyway,\r\n\r\nsince  they  said it was not done, that the  lecturers,\r\n\r\nout of their anxiety probably to try and be in the good\r\n\r\nbooks  of the Government, tried to show how the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis   a   good   Government   compared   with   previous\r\n\r\ngovernments, and how the present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister is a better man than the  previous  two\r\n\r\nChief  Ministers,  would  the Government  give  us  the\r\n\r\nassurance that they would send out instructions to  the\r\n\r\nlecturers that that is not to be done, and that if they\r\n\r\ndo it, they will face the consequences?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am not aware that lecturers\r\n\r\never  do  such things. From the subject matter  of  the\r\n\r\ntalks,  there is no occasion for them ever to say  that\r\n\r\nthis Government is better than the previous government,\r\n\r\nalthough  this is self-evident to the population.  They\r\n\r\nare there to discuss larger problems like what is meant\r\n\r\nby  economic  development and how does it  fit  in - that\r\n\r\nsort  of  thing. They only incidentally  say  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is doing, whether it is succeeding  or  not.\r\n\r\nThe civil service knows what is going on and, as I say,\r\n\r\nnobody  is  going to bluff them. You are  dealing  with\r\n\r\npeople  who  are  capable of good  judgment.  We  never\r\n\r\nunderestimate their ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member for Mountbatten asked whether\r\n\r\nAssemblymen could attend the course if they want to  do\r\n\r\nso. I would like to think about this. It is, of course,\r\n\r\nmeant  for civil servants. Personally I see no harm  if\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Mountbatten would like to  attend  it.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, if it is a general principle, I\r\n\r\nam not quite sure what the implications are. Perhaps if\r\n\r\nshe could quietly go there and nobody is the wiser,  it\r\n\r\nwould not do anybody any harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just\r\n\r\nlike to point out that it has been done before.

The last political post he held in a  Party\r\n\r\nwas  as  the Organising Secretary for the Labour Front,\r\n\r\nand he helped the People's Action Party to win the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  elections. Therefore, his appointment  to  his\r\n\r\npresent  post gives rise to wonderment on the  part  of\r\n\r\nthe public. Yet the Government wants to follow a course\r\n\r\nof  neutrality.  I  think it  would  be  wise  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to appoint people who are known for  having\r\n\r\nbeen neutral in local politics, and they would then  be\r\n\r\nclear  of  all these adverse criticisms that are  being\r\n\r\nmade.  It  is no use the Government saying  that  their\r\n\r\ndirectives  are neutral. Directives can be  neutral  on\r\n\r\npaper  but it is the people who carry them out that  is\r\n\r\nthe  important thing, and if they are not neutral,  the\r\n\r\npolicy  can appear to be neutral but the actions  belie\r\n\r\nthe written policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the point raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin is that the incumbent  helped  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to victory in the City Council elections.

I  only  ask  this\r\n\r\nquestion because, over the last two days when questions\r\n\r\nwere  being asked about travelling allowances  and  why\r\n\r\nvotes  were going up, the answer given was that  it  is\r\n\r\nbecoming  necessary  because of merger  and  Government\r\n\r\nofficers have to fly across every now and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen,  and  therefore  it  is  necessary  to  have   an\r\n\r\nincreased vote. So I hope that the first answer is  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  answer, and that is this: these  Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nTravelling  Expenses are expenses  in  connection  with\r\n\r\nthe  recruitment of outside officers coming in or going\r\n\r\nout  as a result of that recruitment. But I am now told\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  several votes  which  the  Government\r\n\r\ncould  go to for travelling expenses.

I\r\n\r\nthink  the House should know what particular travelling\r\n\r\nexpenses  are  being charged to what  particular  vote.\r\n\r\nThe  ability to pick on the first, second or third vote\r\n\r\nand  charge  travelling expenses to any  one  of  these\r\n\r\nthree votes is an unsatisfactory position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, there are two subheads here\r\n\r\nwhich are relevant.

But, unfortunately, he did not have  time  to\r\n\r\nreply  to  me. I think perhaps he should  be  given  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  do so. The first point  is  about  the\r\n\r\nrepayment  by Government of taxes which have been  paid\r\n\r\nunder  an  assessment already made and  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nwhich the tax-payer has appealed but has had to pay the\r\n\r\ntax even before he could lodge the appeal. The point  I\r\n\r\nmade  in my previous speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, is  that\r\n\r\nin  those cases the Comptroller and his staff should do\r\n\r\ntheir  utmost  to  see  that when they  have  satisfied\r\n\r\nthemselves  that there has in fact been an  overpayment\r\n\r\nand  the  quantum  of the return of the  tax  has  been\r\n\r\nagreed  upon, then the repayment of such sum should  be\r\n\r\nmade  without  any delay. I have heard complaints,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, not only from one or two, but from  quite\r\n\r\na  few  that  although the quantum of  the  refund  was\r\n\r\nagreed  upon, yet the refund has been unduly prolonged.\r\n\r\nI  am  also informed that in some cases it has taken  a\r\n\r\nyear or more to refund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nis this. You will recollect the debate we had in this\r\n\r\nHouse when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of Finance was asking for  additional\r\n\r\npowers  for  his  tax  officers.  The  powers   were\r\n\r\nresisted  by  the Opposition. Some of us  had  hoped\r\n\r\nthat, by the increase in powers for the officers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Income Tax Department, at least the  net  would\r\n\r\nhave  been cast wider to bring in a group of persons\r\n\r\nwho  have so far evaded the taxing officers. Sir,  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people  are  of  the  opinion  that  the\r\n\r\nincreased powers are being used to harass the people\r\n\r\nwho  are  already paying taxes, asking them  to  pay\r\n\r\nquicker,  asking  them all sorts of questions.  That\r\n\r\nmay  be  good  in a way. Sir. But I think  what  the\r\n\r\npublic  at  large and this House would be interested\r\n\r\nto hear from the Finance Minister is this - that as\r\n\r\na  result  of  these  increased  powers,  where  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers were X in number, it has now become X plus\r\n\r\nY,  and  these powers have, in fact, brought to  the\r\n\r\npublic  coffers  greater sums of  money  than  would\r\n\r\notherwise have been brought in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nraise  another point that was discussed here sometime\r\n\r\nago.  That  is the question of providing  income  tax\r\n\r\nrelief  for  dependent parents. Sir, I well  remember\r\n\r\nbeing on the Pan-Malayan Liaison Committee to discuss\r\n\r\nincome  tax  relief.  It  was  pointed  out   by   an\r\n\r\nexpatriate officer that in Europe, a family consisted\r\n\r\nof  only  husband  and wife and  children,  and  that\r\n\r\nparents could not be regarded as being members of the\r\n\r\nfamily.  It was pointed out that in view of that  and\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  local people often  adopt  too  many\r\n\r\nparents,  therefore, they were not prepared to  agree\r\n\r\nto personal relief being given. But, Sir, since then,\r\n\r\nbecause  we have the Ordinance operating for quite  a\r\n\r\nlong  time and income tax revenue has been increasing\r\n\r\neach  year, I wonder whether it is not time  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance to give favourable consideration\r\n\r\nto  this, in view of the fact that we do not have old\r\n\r\nage pension in Singapore - where the parents are really\r\n\r\ndependants - and   whether  he  would   not   consider\r\n\r\nproviding  some personal relief in the case  of  wage\r\n\r\nearners who have to support dependent parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> First, Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nrepayment of tax which was not properly due. The\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park raised this subject in the\r\n\r\ndebate on the Government's financial policy. After\r\n\r\nthis debate I discussed this matter with the\r\n\r\nComptroller of Inland Revenue. He has assured me that\r\n\r\nit is the policy of his Department to make repayments\r\n\r\nas expeditiously as possible. But sometimes before\r\n\r\npayment of money is actually made, certain\r\n\r\nformalities have to be gone through. Further, the\r\n\r\nInland Revenue Department would also require certain\r\n\r\ninformation to arrive at the actual quantum. He\r\n\r\nassured me that if there was anybody who felt that he\r\n\r\nwas unjustly treated in this matter, and if that\r\n\r\nindividual would write to the Comptroller personally,\r\n\r\nhe himself would intervene and he would get repayment\r\n\r\nmade as quickly as possible. I fully agree it is\r\n\r\nquite wrong for Government to hang on to money which\r\n\r\nis not due to it, and the sooner it is paid back the\r\n\r\nbetter it would be both for the public and for the\r\n\r\nInland Revenue Department itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the wider powers which we obtained from\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly last year, the Member for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nwould  like  to have an account of how  these  powers\r\n\r\nwere used and with what results. Briefly, I think  we\r\n\r\ncan  divide  these special powers into three  groups.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  we sought from the Assembly power  for  the\r\n\r\nComptroller of Inland Revenue to ask for payments  of\r\n\r\ntax  on assessment raised by him even where there  is\r\n\r\nan objection lodged by the taxpayer, the ground being\r\n\r\nthat  people  do  lodge objections  in  the  hope  of\r\n\r\ndelaying payment. Under the old law, the taxpayer was\r\n\r\nnot  obliged to make any payment until the  objection\r\n\r\nwas  resolved by the Income Tax Board of Review.  The\r\n\r\nresult  of  granting  this  increased  power  to  the\r\n\r\nComptroller   has   been   most   satisfactory.   The\r\n\r\nComptroller  has  no  occasion  to  use  this   power\r\n\r\nextensively, but there has been a marked acceleration\r\n\r\nin  the process of raising assessments. Taxpayers are\r\n\r\nnow quicker\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  give  information because there is nothing or  very\r\n\r\nlittle to gain by delaying assessment. So the effect of\r\n\r\nthat, I think, has been very beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group of powers relates to the collection\r\n\r\nof  information by various measures. It  is  still  too\r\n\r\nearly  to assess how effective this would be, how  much\r\n\r\nthe extra yield to the revenue would ensue from the use\r\n\r\nof this special power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should explain, Mr Speaker. Sir, that\r\n\r\nthere  is  in the Inland Revenue Department  a  section\r\n\r\ncalled the Investigation Unit. It is a small unit,  but\r\n\r\nit  comprises a very skilled investigation staff.  Each\r\n\r\nyear  they  collect  nearly 10 per cent  of  the  total\r\n\r\nrevenue  due  from income tax. The present position  is\r\n\r\nthat  they have found this power useful. I do not think\r\n\r\nthey  can  be  accused of using this power excessively,\r\n\r\nbecause  we have no public outcry against it. Certainly\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Farrer Park, who takes an interest  in\r\n\r\nthis   matter,   has  not  put  forward  any   specific\r\n\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there is the requirement that certain\r\n\r\nclasses of business give receipts, and if they do  not,\r\n\r\nthey  can  be required to give receipts. This also  has\r\n\r\nborne fruit. Two doctors in private practice have been.\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  prosecuted for failing to give  receipts,\r\n\r\nand  very substantial tax assessments have been  raised\r\n\r\non  them. Action against a third doctor is pending.  I\r\n\r\nhave  no  doubt the medical profession will  in  future\r\n\r\nmake their proper share to the State revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin has raised the old question of\r\n\r\nrelief for the aged parents. Quite frankly, I have  not\r\n\r\ngiven  much  thought to this subject.  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  I should, in view of the fact that income  tax\r\n\r\nlegislation will be a Federal subject. So for the  time\r\n\r\nbeing, I would say I prefer to reserve my position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I want to bring up the question of\r\n\r\nthe  Review  Committee for the review of property  tax.\r\n\r\nThis is the Committee where only P.A.P.

Now  we  have the  same  thing  happening\r\n\r\nagain.  We  are  just wondering if  it  is  a  case  of\r\n\r\nconciliation  and sympathy being given only  to  people\r\n\r\nwho happen to know P.A.P. Assemblymen or people who are\r\n\r\nsympathetic  towards the P.A.P. Why  should  only  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen be in that Committee?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The reason simply, Sir, is that it\r\n\r\nis not a statutory Committee. It has no powers. It just\r\n\r\nmeets  in a really unofficial advisory status to assist\r\n\r\nthe  Property  Tax  Department.  There  is  a  lot   of\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding, especially among occupiers or  owners\r\n\r\nof  low  value  property. We do not get much  tax  from\r\n\r\nthese  small  houses,  attap  houses  and  so  on.  But\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  assessment must be raised in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  law.  Otherwise the whole  thing  becomes  a\r\n\r\nstanding  invitation to evade tax. There is  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding. The tax officials,  of  course,  take\r\n\r\nthe  stand  that  that is the law and  that  they  must\r\n\r\nenforce  it to the hilt. On the other hand, Assemblymen\r\n\r\nwho are in touch with public opinion realise that while\r\n\r\nyou  should  collect your fair share  of  tax  due,  it\r\n\r\nshould  be done in such a way that people, if they  are\r\n\r\nnot happy, are at least satisfied that they are parting\r\n\r\nwith  money  due to the Government. The  Committee  has\r\n\r\nbeen  formed  and because it is purely an advisory  and\r\n\r\nnot  a  statutory Committee, we have decided  that  the\r\n\r\nbest way to get work done expeditiously is to appoint a\r\n\r\nCommittee of Government Assemblymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to make it an All-Party Committee, then\r\n\r\nyou can be sure, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the fracas which\r\n\r\nhas  threatened to develop in the House but  has  never\r\n\r\nquite  succeeded  might well run out of  hand  in  this\r\n\r\nlittle Committee. The Committee, of course, serves all\r\n\r\nsections of the community.

I would like to point out  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance that the extra cost of the tax  on\r\n\r\nvacant   newly-built  properties  is   not   borne   by\r\n\r\ndevelopers.  If the developers know that they  have  to\r\n\r\npay  the extra cost, they will put up the price of  the\r\n\r\nhouses and the poor people who have saved up all  their\r\n\r\nlives  to buy a home suffers that extra cost. The extra\r\n\r\ncost is not borne by the developer. It is always passed\r\n\r\non to the poor buyer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other tax is on properties that are not new,\r\n\r\npeople  who  actually  rent  out  houses.  People   pay\r\n\r\nassessment  and Government charges assessment  for  the\r\n\r\nservices  that they render, such as roads  and  so  on,\r\n\r\nwhich  enhances  the value of the property.  But,  Sir,\r\n\r\nproperties do get a higher rent when they are furnished\r\n\r\nand  that  extra money is provided by the house  owners\r\n\r\nthemselves. The Government gets income tax as  well  as\r\n\r\nassessment  on  part  of it, because  they  only  allow\r\n\r\ndeduction of the value of the property divided by  five\r\n\r\nyears.  You are supposed to get back the money in  five\r\n\r\nyears,  and property after five years, everybody knows,\r\n\r\nis  worth  nothing. While the owner suffers that  loss,\r\n\r\nthe Government is benefiting by the extra that they get\r\n\r\nfrom  income tax and property tax. What I want to point\r\n\r\nout is this. While the house owners receive that extra,\r\n\r\nthey  pay  Government extra. To a  certain  extent,  it\r\n\r\nmight be justified. But when they do not receive  that\r\n\r\nextra, they do not receive any rents at all, the  extra\r\n\r\nis  presumed to exist, although the rents do not exist.\r\n\r\nPeople  have  had to pay assessment on the extra  which\r\n\r\ndoes  not exist at all because the house is unoccupied.\r\n\r\nSo  not only are they paying for the assessment on  the\r\n\r\nrent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the house, it the rent is, let us say, $100, and by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  the place being furnished, apart  from  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  the  furniture that is allowed by Government,\r\n\r\nGovernment  charges another $70 extra. So you  have  to\r\n\r\npay 36 per cent on the $70, which does not exist except\r\n\r\nhypothetically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I struggle with the\r\n\r\ndisadvantage of not really understanding what the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember was saying.

But  the\r\n\r\npoint  I  want to make here is that we in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, in fact, do not grudge the Ministers and  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries getting the extra money.  But\r\n\r\nI  would  like to point out, Sir, that this $2,500  and\r\n\r\n$1,500  are  not sums of money coming from  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npurse.  They are coming from the public purse to  which\r\n\r\nevery  man  in the street contributes by way of  taxes.\r\n\r\nParticularly here, Sir, the Minister for Labour has the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  be neutral in dealing  with  labour\r\n\r\ndisputes  which  involve  the lives  of  thousands  and\r\n\r\nthousands of workers. It is important for the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself and the Parliamentary Secretary himself to  set\r\n\r\nan   example  of  neutrality,  because  invariably  the\r\n\r\nMinister  shows bias against the unions which  are  not\r\n\r\nled by P.A.P. henchmen. The staff who are in the civil\r\n\r\nservice  tend  to follow the footsteps of the  Minister\r\n\r\nand the Parliamentary Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, numerous incidents have taken place,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the last six months or so,  which  show\r\n\r\nthat the intention .f the Government in operating  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Labour  and  Law  is  merely   to   give\r\n\r\nrecognition, blessing and whatever other assistance can\r\n\r\nbe  given,  to strengthening trade unions led  by  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhenchmen  like  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture. I do not think I have the  time,\r\n\r\nnor  will you permit me, to touch on all the incidents.\r\n\r\nBut briefly, Sir, I would like to illustrate what I say\r\n\r\nby  what, in fact, happened in the case of the  dispute\r\n\r\nof  the  Shaw Brothers employees. Sir, as everybody  is\r\n\r\naware,  at the height of the dispute, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  denounced the leadership of the union  involved\r\n\r\nand  called  the  workers to attend a  meeting  at  the\r\n\r\nVictoria Memorial Hall. On the surface of it,  Sir,  it\r\n\r\nall  looked  a very fine thing to happen.

On the surface of it,\r\n\r\nas  I was saying, it all looked very fine. The Minister\r\n\r\nwanted  to  settle a dispute of these workers  and  was\r\n\r\nover-anxious to intervene. So he asked all the  workers\r\n\r\nto  attend  a general meeting at the Victoria  Memorial\r\n\r\nHall. But if we were to look a little deeper, it was  a\r\n\r\nvery sinister move, made deliberately to undermine  the\r\n\r\ncollective  bargaining position of the trade  union  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers involved, and to undermine its rights  and\r\n\r\nprivileges. Sir, at no time in the past has there  been\r\n\r\nan  occasion  where workers involved in a dispute  were\r\n\r\ncalled to attend a conciliation meeting by ignoring the\r\n\r\ntrade union. In this particular case, there was a trade\r\n\r\nunion which is registered under the laws of the country\r\n\r\nand  which is recognised by the Government as  a  legal\r\n\r\norganisation  representing  the  workers  concerned.  A\r\n\r\ntrade union which enjoyed the support and confidence of\r\n\r\nevery  worker involved. Yet the Government thought  fit\r\n\r\nto disregard the union, call the workers up so as to be\r\n\r\nable  to make political capital out of the dispute.  As\r\n\r\nwe  are  all aware, the workers saw through this.  They\r\n\r\nquite definitely stayed away. Even the Minister did not\r\n\r\ndare  go  and  face  the  empty hall  in  the  Victoria\r\n\r\nMemorial Hall the next day. But this is just one of the\r\n\r\ninstances,   Sir,   where  the  Government   Ministers,\r\n\r\nparticularly here the Minister for Labour, are prepared\r\n\r\nto  go  to  any  lengths, even to  the  extent  of  co-operating  on  the  quiet with  the  employers,  as  to\r\n\r\nundermine the work of trade unions which are not  loyal\r\n\r\nto  the  P.A.P. Sir, we have been accused  of  so  many\r\n\r\nthings.  We  have been told that we are in  control  of\r\n\r\nunions  and  we control the workers and so  on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.  But it would appear, Sir, from events that  all\r\n\r\nthese  allegations are unfounded, and all that  emerges\r\n\r\nis  the fact that the Labour Ministry today is, we  are\r\n\r\ntold, to be biased against the non-P.A.P. unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before I conclude. I would like to give one more\r\n\r\nlittle example, Sir,I do not have the constitution  of\r\n\r\nthe Amalgamated Union of Public Employees here. But  if\r\n\r\none  were  to look at the constitution, one would  find\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary-General of the Union is allowed to  hold\r\n\r\noffice for five years, and there is a provision to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  the constitution of the Union  cannot  be\r\n\r\namended for three years from 1961. All that it means is\r\n\r\nthat  for  four years the Secretary-General  cannot  be\r\n\r\nremoved by the workers. I am not a lawyer, Sir,  but  I\r\n\r\nhave been told that this is ultra vires the Trade Union\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  I  do not know how the Registrar  of  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  was  told  to register this  constitution.  And\r\n\r\nthere  are numerous other examples, Sir. I do not  want\r\n\r\nto  take  away  the time of this House by  pouring  out\r\n\r\ninstance after instance. The only request I would  like\r\n\r\nto  make of the Government is to try and run the Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  as  a government machinery dedicated  to  the\r\n\r\ncause  of  settling trade dispute in a neutral  manner.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry of Labour is not a P.A.P. outfit, and the\r\n\r\nMinister is not paid, as I have said earlier, from  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. purse. This is particularly important. I do  not\r\n\r\nblame   the  civil  servants  I  have  had  the   nasty\r\n\r\nexperience  of  facing up to some of the officials  who\r\n\r\nare  civil servants in the Ministry of Labour  and  who\r\n\r\nput  forward a very biased line against the  non-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunions.  But  I certainly do not blame them  because  I\r\n\r\nknow  they have jobs to safeguard, and if they  do  not\r\n\r\nplay  the P.A.P. line, they will find themselves losing\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs. That is precisely why it is necessary  for\r\n\r\nthem to set an example. I have no doubt that if they do\r\n\r\nset  an example, the civil servants in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour will follow suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum to be allocated for Head 44 he reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>As indicated, the debate may range over amendment (2)*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* See footnote at col. 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite\r\n\r\nappreciate why the Member for Thomson should  make  all\r\n\r\nthese  unfounded allegations against the  Minister  and\r\n\r\nmyself and even against the officials in my Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Health and Law\r\n\r\nwill bear me out that, before the parting of ways,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson and many of his  union  associates\r\n\r\nused to complain to me and also to the present Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Health   and  Law  that  the  officers   in   the\r\n\r\nConciliation Office were not doing their work properly.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  I do not have a copy of  the  documents\r\n\r\nhere.  It  was  sometime last year when  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGeneral  Employees  Union  made  unfounded  allegations\r\n\r\nagainst  the officials in the Ministry that  they  were\r\n\r\nnot doing their work properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in a trade dispute, it is very\r\n\r\ndifficult for the officers in the Ministry to hold  the\r\n\r\nbalance. What the unions expect officers there to do is\r\n\r\nto speak on their behalf. There is a difference between\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants and the Minister and  myself.  The\r\n\r\nMinister and I can explain and discuss a matter with an\r\n\r\nemployer. Sometimes we have to make use of our position\r\n\r\nto  force  an  unreasonable  employer  to  come  to  an\r\n\r\nagreement with his employees. Some employers are  quite\r\n\r\nreluctant  to come to an agreement with their employees\r\n\r\nunless they are faced with industrial action. So  under\r\n\r\nthose  circumstances where we know that  the  employers\r\n\r\nare  unreasonable and the workers are  forced  to  take\r\n\r\nindustrial  action to reach an agreement, we  give  our\r\n\r\nadvice and sometimes we press the employers to reach an\r\n\r\nagreement  with  the  unions. So all  this  while,  the\r\n\r\nunions  expect  the officers to adopt  the  same  stand\r\n\r\ntaken by the Minister and myself. As these officers are\r\n\r\ncivil  servants, sometimes their advice may  not  carry\r\n\r\nany weight and the employers may not respond to it.  So\r\n\r\nthe  allegation that the officials in the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour are against non-P.A.P. unions in a dispute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  unfounded.  But  the point is  that  there  is  no P.A.P. union  or  non-P.A.P. union. There  has  been  a\r\n\r\nspilt.  There is the N.T.U.C. and the S.A.T.U.,  which\r\n\r\nis under the control of the pro-Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> How do you know?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we now come to\r\n\r\nthe  allegations made with regard to the Shaw Brothers'\r\n\r\ndispute. The Prime Minister in his broadcasts has shown\r\n\r\nto  the  people  of  Singapore  how  the  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nelements  in  the  unions are trying  to  convince  the\r\n\r\nworkers that they are really working for them in  order\r\n\r\nthat  they can control the unions. Therefore, with that\r\n\r\nobjective  in  mind,  a  case  in  point  is  the  Shaw\r\n\r\nBrothers'  dispute. The workers' union submitted  their\r\n\r\ndemands  to  the management and had direct negotiations\r\n\r\nwith the management. When they reached a deadlock, they\r\n\r\ndid  not  refer  the dispute to the Ministry.  In  this\r\n\r\ninstance, I would say that the union was playing  right\r\n\r\ninto the hands of the employer. Instead of appealing to\r\n\r\nus to help them - as we always try to put any union in a\r\n\r\nbetter position - they tried to show that they were in a\r\n\r\nbetter  position, and they also tried to  convince  the\r\n\r\nworkers  that  they could get what they wanted  without\r\n\r\nresorting  to  the  Ministry of Labour.  So  when  they\r\n\r\nreached  a deadlock - just as when they were in  trouble\r\n\r\nover  the  political issues, instead of consulting  the\r\n\r\nnationalists   in  Malaya  they  went   to   see   Lord\r\n\r\nSelkirk - what  did  they do? They  went  to  consult  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate  lawyer,  Mr Booker, whom  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson defended just now. They had a behind the scenes\r\n\r\ntalk. But the employers got fed up with the attitude of\r\n\r\nthe  union  and  with  the way  the  negotiations  were\r\n\r\nhandled.  They therefore made up their minds  to  close\r\n\r\ndown. This dispute only concerns those employed in  the\r\n\r\nadministrative  office. It is very easy  for  the  Shaw\r\n\r\nOrganisation to transfer their administration office to\r\n\r\nKuala   Lumpur.  When  we  understood  that  the   Shaw\r\n\r\nOrganisation intended\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  close down and transfer their administrative office\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, we had to step in, as\r\n\r\nwe  had  the  interest of the workers in mind.  We  can\r\n\r\nassure the House that we are not going to be so foolish\r\n\r\nas  the  previous  Government which,  in  its  foolish\r\n\r\nanxiety  to build a union of its own, got into  trouble\r\n\r\nbecause it tried to have people like Mr Jaganathan  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up the T.U.C. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  fall into that sort of trap. As far  as  the\r\n\r\nworkers  are  concerned, we treat  them  all  the  same - \r\n\r\nwhether they are members of S.A.T.U. or of the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. Government will look after the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers, but we are not going to build up S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\nThat  is  our  policy insofar as the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers are concerned, and we will always maintain that\r\n\r\npolicy.  As  I said just now, we were afraid  that  the\r\n\r\nhundred workers involved in the Shaw dispute might lose\r\n\r\ntheir   jobs,  and  therefore  the  Minister   himself\r\n\r\nconvened  a  meeting  between  the  employees  and  the\r\n\r\nemployers.  We  knew that the union  officials  had  an\r\n\r\nulterior  motive  behind the dispute.  So  before  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  was  convened, the management  instructed  its\r\n\r\nlegal adviser, Mr Booker, to have a consultation  with\r\n\r\nme.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not like to reveal what  we\r\n\r\ndiscussed,  but  this is what exactly took  place.  The\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the  management  said  they  were\r\n\r\nalways prepared to negotiate with the workers, but they\r\n\r\nwanted  me  to assure them that in case of  a  deadlock\r\n\r\nagain the Government would not refer the dispute to the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court. If the management were sincere  and\r\n\r\ngenuine in their desire to negotiate - and the union did\r\n\r\napproach them behind the scenes - why did they want me to\r\n\r\ngive  them  an assurance that if there was a  deadlock\r\n\r\nthe  dispute  should not be referred to the Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt?  Anyway,  insofar as that proposed  meeting  was\r\n\r\nconcerned, the Minister received many telephone calls -that  the employers were very anxious to attend.  Later\r\n\r\non,  after  seeing the Minister, as the representatives\r\n\r\nof the management agreed to resume negotiations in the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour, we therefore arranged a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeeting  there the following day where the two  parties\r\n\r\nmet again and concluded an agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point is this, Mr Speaker, Sir. It appears\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Thomson is accusing the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour, after the parting of ways, of being biased  and\r\n\r\nprejudiced against the so-called non-P.A.P. unions. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that is definitely not the case,  and  I\r\n\r\nchallenge  the  hon. Member to produce facts  in  cases\r\n\r\nwhere we have done so. For his information - maybe he is\r\n\r\nnow  too  busy with his Party and with his trade  union\r\n\r\naffairs which are being handled by his colleagues - there\r\n\r\nare  so  many  cases handled by the Singapore  Business\r\n\r\nHouses  Union in which demands are submitted and direct\r\n\r\nnegotiations  with the management are  asked  for:  and\r\n\r\nwhere   negotiations  have  come  to  a  deadlock   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  suggest  that  they  be  referred  to   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour. On many occasions, the  management\r\n\r\nhave complained to me that the unions refuse to do  so.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, I have to advise the employers to refer\r\n\r\nthe  negotiations to the Ministry of  Labour.  On  many\r\n\r\noccasions,  the  Commissioner for Labour  has  arranged\r\n\r\nmeetings  in  order  to  break  the  deadlock  in   the\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  These are cases which the unions  refuse\r\n\r\nto  refer to the Ministry of Labour. So where  then  is\r\n\r\nthe  truth  in  the allegation that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nbiased  and prejudiced against the so-called non-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can assure the House that as far\r\n\r\nas the Government are concerned, we will carry out our\r\n\r\nworkers' policy and we do not care whether they  belong\r\n\r\nto  this  or  that  union. Where  their  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice  need revision and adjustment, we  will  always\r\n\r\nsupport them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I would have loved to let this\r\n\r\ndebate  be  a  battle between comrades and ex-comrades,\r\n\r\nbut  the Parliamentary Secretary has found it necessary\r\n\r\nto bring in the previous Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Government did not do anything to corner\r\n\r\nthe  workers'  market, as the P.A.P. did. The  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment even persuaded the then T.U.C. to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadmit  the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  to  be  the Secretary-General of  the  T.U.C.,\r\n\r\nalthough  he  was  known to be a  very  staunch  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsupporter. And yet when the P.A.P. came into power  and\r\n\r\nthe  same staunch P.A.P. supporter continued to be  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the T.U.C., what  did  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndo?  They  cornered  the  whole market.  Every  staunch\r\n\r\nP.A.P. supporter was made an Assistant Secretary with a\r\n\r\nfive-year  term of office. If they want  to  fight,  to\r\n\r\nlash  out  and  have it out with their ex-comrades  and\r\n\r\ndisclose  all guilty secrets, they can do so; but  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  try to accuse the previous  Government  of\r\n\r\ndoing  something which they themselves have been  doing\r\n\r\nand for which they should be ashamed. The Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  has  said that there are no  P.A.P. unions.\r\n\r\nCome,  come, do not make us laugh!

In the first place, I did not blame the staff  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Labour. It is, in fact, true that from\r\n\r\ntime to time we have criticised individual officials of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Labour. We have done this  ever  since\r\n\r\nMay  1959,  that is, after the elections,  and  perhaps\r\n\r\nsome  of this was put down in writing and given to  the\r\n\r\nformer   Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  or   to   his\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I was making was that if the Minister and\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary themselves show bias,  you\r\n\r\ndo  not  expect your civil servants not to  show  bias,\r\n\r\nespecially when they know that if they do not show bias\r\n\r\nthey may be faced with a \"walking certificate\". Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave  had  numerous unpleasant occasions  when - and  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary knows this very well - I had even\r\n\r\nto  phone up my political opponent to save me from  the\r\n\r\ntortures  of the Ministry of Labour officials.  I  have\r\n\r\nhad  very  many unpleasant occasions when  puny  little\r\n\r\nlabour officers came to strike posts and addressed  the\r\n\r\nstrikers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non picket rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and then said that\r\n\r\nno  union  official should be at picket spots.  I  then\r\n\r\nasked him, \"What law says that no union official should\r\n\r\nbe  at picket spots?\" And he said, \"I have been told by\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary.\" Instead of arguing  with\r\n\r\nthe  poor  civil servant, I phoned up on  a  number  of\r\n\r\noccasions  the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nthemselves.  I have no doubt there are  a  few  labour\r\n\r\nofficers  and  high-ranking  officials  in  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry who go out of their way to try and please  the\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the Parliamentary Secretary  by  showing\r\n\r\nover-bias  against non-P.A.P. unions. I  want  to  make\r\n\r\nthis  quite  clear, Sir. I certainly do not blame  them\r\n\r\nbecause I know this is being done because they want  to\r\n\r\nkeep  their jobs so that they can get their pay at  the\r\n\r\nend of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, on the Shaw Brothers dispute. I do not\r\n\r\nwant  to  spend  much  time on  it.  The  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary   was   saying  that  I  was   defending   an\r\n\r\nexpatriate. He knows well I would be the last person to\r\n\r\ndefend  an  expatriate.  For his  information,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand Mr Booker is a Singapore citizen. I am  not\r\n\r\ndefending  him. I know him casually and met him  across\r\n\r\nthe  negotiating table. And I have no, doubt  that  my\r\n\r\ndefending him will be more embarrassing to him than  to\r\n\r\nme.  Therefore, it was not my intention to defend  him.\r\n\r\nHe  was appointed by the Shaw Brothers Organisation  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  on  behalf of the management, and  naturally\r\n\r\nthe   union's  representatives  had  to  meet  him   to\r\n\r\nnegotiate. There was nothing strange or sinister  about\r\n\r\nit.  What,  in  fact, happened during the  dispute  and\r\n\r\nnegotiations  clearly  showed  the  attitude   of   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour and his Parliamentary  Secretary.\r\n\r\nNegotiations  on wage claims were carried  on  for  six\r\n\r\nmonths.  Although they were protracted,  there  was  no\r\n\r\ndeadlock, no ill-feeling, and the talks were held in  a\r\n\r\nquite friendly atmosphere. Then one fine morning,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Shaw Brothers just closed the premises and  locked\r\n\r\nout  the  workers. I do not know The reason. I am  told\r\n\r\nthat Mr Run Run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShaw and the Minister for Finance are good friends.  It\r\n\r\nwas  a shock to the workers. Sir, one fine morning they\r\n\r\nwent  to  work  and found notices on the board  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  it was a lockout. And then  negotiations,\r\n\r\nand  negotiations. [interruption] Yes, there was a sit-down  strike. I am not pulling any bluff. There  was  a\r\n\r\nsit-down strike, but nevertheless talks were held in  a\r\n\r\nfriendly atmosphere. After this lockout, the union  and\r\n\r\nthe  management  got  together.  There  was  a  lot  of\r\n\r\npersuasion  on  the  part  of  the  union  before   the\r\n\r\nmanagement agreed to continue the talks. In the  course\r\n\r\nof  the talks, the union was informed by the management\r\n\r\nthat  they were told not to settle the dispute  outside\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Ministry. This is the point - why  must  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour advise the employer not  to  settle\r\n\r\nthe  dispute  outside  the Labour Office?  Because  the\r\n\r\nunion  knew  this  and  understood  the  situation  the\r\n\r\nemployer was in, in the final stages it agreed to go to\r\n\r\nthe Labour Ministry: The most interesting part here  is\r\n\r\nthis:  right through the negotiations, as I said, there\r\n\r\nwas  a  friendly atmosphere and even after the deadlock\r\n\r\nthe  negotiations  were continued  and  concluded.  But\r\n\r\nbecause of the insistence of the Labour Ministry,  this\r\n\r\nis  what  they were told - after coming to an agreement\r\n\r\noutside the Ministry of Labour - that both parties had to\r\n\r\ngo  to  the Labour Ministry for a formal agreement  and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Yes,  I  agree  to this.\"  That  was  the  case.\r\n\r\n[interruption] He wants proof, Sir. I do not think  you\r\n\r\nwill  allow me to quote hundreds of instances,  but  if\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary  Secretary wants,  I  can  give  him\r\n\r\nsufficient proof to show how the Ministry of Labour  is\r\n\r\nbeing  used as a P.A.P. outfit to make political  capital\r\n\r\nout  of legitimate trade disputes of the workers. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think, Sir, this is the place for me to quote  all\r\n\r\nthat.  But  in  passing,  I  might  as  well  say  that\r\n\r\neverybody  knows  the Singapore Manual  and  Mercantile\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union has Government blessing to  the  extent\r\n\r\nwhere  they go to the employer and say, \"I  want  to  -organise  the  workers into my union,  the  Manual  and\r\n\r\nMercantile  Workers' Union. Will you  please  circulate\r\n\r\nthis letter on our behalf?\" And the employer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nco-operates  with  the Manual and  Mercantile  Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion  in helping to organise their union. In the first\r\n\r\nplace,  no employer likes to organise the workers  into\r\n\r\nany  union, be it a P.A.P. union. But the fact that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore today the employers, at least some employers,\r\n\r\nare  prepared  to  assist  the  Manual  and  Mercantile\r\n\r\nWorkers'   Union  to  organise  workers  is   a   clear\r\n\r\nindication of the extent of the blessing the Manual and\r\n\r\nMercantile  Workers'  Union  is  receiving   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary also said that we object to going to the Labour Ministry when the employers want to go to the Labour Ministry. That is a fact. The employers want to go to the Labour Ministry because the employers have been told, \"You don't settle with the union outside, because I cannot make political capital. So everytime you face a set of claims from the union,\r\n\r\nyou  refer to the Labour Ministry.\" The employers  say,\r\n\r\n\"I  want to refer this to the Labour Ministry.\" And  we\r\n\r\nsay, \"Why should you, because there is no deadlock.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is a deadlock and if we want conciliation,  then\r\n\r\nwe are quite prepared to go to the Labour Ministry. But\r\n\r\nright  now  there  is no deadlock and  we  continue  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate.\" That is the point I am making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have a situation where the Government, having\r\n\r\nlost  the support of the workers, is trying to  make  a\r\n\r\ncomeback  by using a few unionists and some adventurous\r\n\r\nemployers.  In  the  process, they show  complete  bias\r\n\r\nagainst the majority of the unions in Singapore,  which\r\n\r\nare  not P.A.P. unions. That is precisely why I ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment, particularly the Minister for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nhis  Parliamentary Secretary, to make sure that  in  so\r\n\r\nfar as handling trade disputes is concerned, try to be\r\n\r\nneutral.  If  they  want to compete  with  us  for  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of the workers in settling trade disputes,  we\r\n\r\nare  quite  prepared to accept them in the trade  union\r\n\r\nfield.  There  are a few outfits, like the  Manual  and\r\n\r\nMercantile  Workers' Union, the Amalgamated  Union  of\r\n\r\nPublic Employees - a few, not more than five or six.  But\r\n\r\nif they want, they can have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  few more. We are quite prepared to compete with them\r\n\r\nin  the trade union field. But we do not want the State\r\n\r\nmachinery to be used to make political capital  out  of\r\n\r\nthe legitimate trade disputes of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nknows as much as I do that the Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nhis  Parliamentary Secretary are fair-minded gentlemen.\r\n\r\nIt is completely untrue to say that they are in any way\r\n\r\nbiased  against  what he chooses to  describe  as  non-P.A.P. unions. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nknows this very well. He participated in the debate  on\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial  Relations  Ordinance.  He  knows  that\r\n\r\nOrdinance was brought into force with effect from  15th\r\n\r\nSeptember,   1960.   Under  that   Ordinance   certain\r\n\r\nprocedures  are laid down with regard to  negotiations,\r\n\r\nthe  way in which employers and unions get together  to\r\n\r\nreach  a  collective agreement. There is a  requirement\r\n\r\nthat  either  side could serve notice on the  other  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  could  get  together and  begin  collective\r\n\r\nbargaining. For some reason or other, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\na  certain group of unions have never been prepared  to\r\n\r\ninvoke  the provisions of that Ordinance after it  came\r\n\r\ninto  force. I have spoken to them and I have told them\r\n\r\nthat  this  law  has been brought into force  and  have\r\n\r\nasked  them to serve their notices under the provisions\r\n\r\nof  that  Ordinance.  But they  still  choose  to  meet\r\n\r\nmanagements without recourse to the provisions of  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.   They   have  tried  to  reach   collective\r\n\r\nagreements  in  that way, the whole  purpose  being  to\r\n\r\nsidetrack the Industrial Relations Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has referred\r\n\r\nto  the  case of the Shaw Brothers. That is a  case  in\r\n\r\npoint.  The union served their notice on the management\r\n\r\nbut  did  not  invoke the procedures of the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Ordinance. The management  considered  their\r\n\r\nclaims  to  be unreasonable, locked them out and  said.\r\n\r\n\"We  close  shop.\" In all other cases where this  Union\r\n\r\nasked  for negotiations with the managements and  there\r\n\r\nwas a breakdown in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  negotiations, it just went on  strike.  It  would\r\n\r\nnever  use the machinery of conciliation that was  open\r\n\r\nto it under the provisions of this Ordinance. Well, the\r\n\r\ncase  in  reverse was the Shaw Brothers case.  In  that\r\n\r\ncase,  they  were  locked out by  the  management.  The\r\n\r\nmanagement said, \"Well, to hell with all this. We close\r\n\r\ndown.\"  What was the Minister to do? Here  was  a  case\r\n\r\nwhere  the  union and the employer had sidetracked  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The men would suffer if they continued to be\r\n\r\nlocked  out. So what was the Minister to do? He  tried\r\n\r\nto  arrange a meeting where everybody would be present,\r\n\r\nincluding  the union officials and the management.  And\r\n\r\nthat meeting was boycotted by the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Industrial Relations Ordinance\r\n\r\nis  a  good Ordinance if it is used properly. Just  now\r\n\r\nthe  House heard what the Member for Thomson  said.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  they were quite happy to go and negotiate in  the\r\n\r\npresence  of Mr Booker. The Member knows the Ordinance\r\n\r\nprohibits  practising  lawyers  from  participating  in\r\n\r\nnegotiations. This is laid down in black and  white  in\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance. But they preferred to negotiate with Mr\r\n\r\nBooker,  who acted on behalf of the management,  rather\r\n\r\nthan go to the Labour Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, certainly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I do not think it is laid down in the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Industrial Relations Ordinance that a\r\n\r\npractising  lawyer is prohibited from participating  in\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  A  practising lawyer is prohibited  from\r\n\r\npresenting a case in the Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, they have chosen to\r\n\r\ninterpret the Ordinance that way. I agree, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that it is not laid down -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Point of elucidation if the Minister would\r\n\r\ngive way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Minister has not\r\n\r\ncompleted his sentence anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a defect in the\r\n\r\nlaw.  We  believed the unions would play fair  by  that\r\n\r\nOrdinance - that  they would comply with  the  procedures\r\n\r\nlaid  down  in  it. We have found that they  have  done\r\n\r\neverything  they  could  to  side-track  it.  It   will\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  necessary for us to say, by  way  of  an\r\n\r\namendment to the Ordinance, that all negotiations  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  carried out under the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Since the Booker affair. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Bar  Committee has sought a declaration  from  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court  as to the interpretation of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe  Government have agreed to make the position  quite\r\n\r\nclear  by  introducing  an amending  Bill  which  would\r\n\r\nspecifically  state  that all conciliation  proceedings\r\n\r\nand negotiations would have to be within the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the Ordinance, and not outside it, so that we could\r\n\r\nprohibit the side-tracking of its provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson also said\r\n\r\njust  now that he was surprised that the A.U.P.E. could\r\n\r\nhave been registered, and that the Constitution of this\r\n\r\nUnion  itself  provides  for  the  appointment   of   a\r\n\r\nSecretary-General for five years. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave  known  the Member for Thomson for  quite  a  long\r\n\r\ntime.  I  have never heard him once mention to me  that\r\n\r\nall this was ultra vires the Trade Union Ordinance. The\r\n\r\nfirst  time  I  heard about it was this afternoon.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, he has expressed surprise  how  A.U.P.E.\r\n\r\ncould  have been registered. This union, as  far  as  I\r\n\r\nknow,  is an amalgamation of existing unions. A  number\r\n\r\nof   Government   unions  in  the  Postal   Department,\r\n\r\nWoodbridge  Hospital  and some  other  departments  got\r\n\r\ntogether and amalgamated themselves, including  in  the\r\n\r\namalgamation  the  City  Council  Services  Union.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Sir,  there was never any  reference  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister' about this amalgamation. There is power under\r\n\r\nthe  Trade Union Ordinance for the Registrar to approve\r\n\r\nsuch  an  amalgamation. As far  as  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  and as far as I am personally concerned,  I\r\n\r\nnever knew that the A.U.P.E. was registered until after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  had been registered. The Registrar had full power  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  that  situation himself. So I am  really  very\r\n\r\nsurprised   that  the  Member  for  Thomson  should   have\r\n\r\nexpressed surprise that this union had been registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is most unfair that the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson should have tried to suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  the Minister for Labour and his Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary have been unfair in their dealings with  certain\r\n\r\nunions. I have known them personally for a very long  time\r\n\r\nnow,  and I can assure the House that both these men, whom\r\n\r\nI  know so well, are certainly not in any way unfavourably\r\n\r\ndisposed towards any group of unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I want to say only a few words. In the first\r\n\r\nplace,  Sir, as far as the Industrial Relations  Ordinance\r\n\r\ngoes, to  the best of my knowledge, there is no provision\r\n\r\nwhich  prohibits a lawyer from negotiating either for  the\r\n\r\nunion  or  for the employer. The prohibition  is  only  in\r\n\r\npresenting a case in the Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister says that I never said anything\r\n\r\nof  A.U.P.E. before. I am quite sure  it  would  be  very\r\n\r\nembarrassing  to  the  Parliamentary  Secretary   to   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture if I were to  say  everything  that\r\n\r\nhappened in the private conversations between himself, Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull  and  myself  in so far as  the  organisation  of\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E. is concerned. It is not my intention to take more\r\n\r\ntime of this House in discussing this, but I assure  the\r\n\r\nMinister, Sir, that if the Parliamentary Secretary  wants,\r\n\r\nI am quite prepared to say all these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Just one more point, Mr Speaker, Sir. The\r\n\r\nHouse   knows  that  the  Bar  Committee  have  sought   a\r\n\r\ndeclaration  from the High Court on the interpretation  of\r\n\r\nthe  sections  of the Industrial Relations Ordinance  with\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have been dealing. Mr Speaker, Sir, they  have\r\n\r\nmade  it  quite  clear that they accept the position  that\r\n\r\npractising lawyers should not in any way be concerned with\r\n\r\nthe  actual handling of negotiations or appear as  counsel\r\n\r\nbefore the Industrial Arbitration Court. All that the  Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseeking is a declaration that practising lawyers have  the\r\n\r\nright to draw up agreements for their clients-who might be\r\n\r\nunions  of  employees  or who might be  employers-and  the\r\n\r\nright to advise them, without meddling in negotiations and\r\n\r\nappearing before the Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, just on a point of\r\n\r\nelucidation. The Minister mentioned that he did  not  know\r\n\r\nanything about the registration of A.U.P.E. May I ask  him\r\n\r\nwhether he was referring to the first registration or  the\r\n\r\nsecond  registration of A.U.P.E.? Would he also  enlighten\r\n\r\nus  why  A.U.P.E. was dissolved - I think it was  September\r\n\r\n1959 - and why on the same day it was re-registered again?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson has been speaking quite a  lot  about\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E.  I  think  he  must  be  answered.  He  made   an\r\n\r\nallegation  that  if the conversations  that,  took  place\r\n\r\nprivately between the Member for Thomson, Mr Woodhull and\r\n\r\nmyself  were revealed, it might be embarrassing to us.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  Sir, if the conversations that took place between\r\n\r\nthe Member for Thomson, Mr Woodhull, Mr Lim Ching Siong,\r\n\r\nMr  Devan  Nair  and myself were revealed,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nembarrassing also to those who are in the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nat the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the question raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten   could  be  answered  by  me.   It   was   an\r\n\r\namalgamation of two unions - the Singapore Union of Post and\r\n\r\nTelegraph  Workers and the P. & T. Uniformed Staff  Union,\r\n\r\nwhich were in existence in 1946 and 1947 respectively. One\r\n\r\nof these unions had strikes three times in that period. If\r\n\r\nyou will remember, Sir, the present Prime Minister was the\r\n\r\nlegal adviser of the P. & T. Uniformed Staff Union in 1951\r\n\r\nduring the strike. He also represented the Singapore Union\r\n\r\nof  P.  & T. Workers before an arbitration case in  1953.\r\n\r\nThese unions in September 1959 amalgamated and formed what\r\n\r\nwas  called  A.U.P.E. Negotiations took place between  the\r\n\r\nnew   organisation  and  six  other  unions   on   further\r\n\r\namalgamation. The law requires that every time an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namalgamation is effected a new registration should  take\r\n\r\nplace.  That is why the first A.U.P.E. had  to  be  re-registered  again  under a new number.  Eight  unions -which  were  legally constituted and registered - by  a\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot  of  their  members  and  following   the\r\n\r\nprovisions   of   the   Trade   Union   Ordinance,   had\r\n\r\namalgamated  and  created this union.  If  anything  had\r\n\r\nbeen  illegal and unconstitutional, then I  suggest  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Trade Unions should be questioned,  maybe\r\n\r\nby the Member for Thomson or anybody else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, may I reply to a few\r\n\r\ncomments made by the Member for Thomson? If I understand\r\n\r\nhim  correctly, if he is trying to accuse the  Ministry,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  Minister, myself  and  the  officials\r\n\r\nthere, of enforcing the Trade Disputes Ordinance, then I\r\n\r\nwill   have  this  to  say.  Since  he  himself   is   a\r\n\r\nresponsible officer in the union, he should advise  his\r\n\r\nmembers to observe peaceful picketing. Whenever there is\r\n\r\na dispute resulting in industrial action, we always have\r\n\r\na  lot of complaints from the employer that the striking\r\n\r\nemployees are not observing peaceful picketing. What  we\r\n\r\nhave now done, in fact, is to try to give an opportunity\r\n\r\nto  the  union  responsible to advise their  members  to\r\n\r\nobserve  peaceful picketing. If the Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\ndoes  not  want the Labour Ministry to remind  them  and\r\n\r\nadvise  them how to conduct peaceful picketing,  then  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  we abolish, the procedure. But he will have  to\r\n\r\nsee   that   the  members  are  observing  the  peaceful\r\n\r\npicketing rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Shaw Brothers trade dispute, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health and Law has explained this.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot   as   the   Member  for  Thomson   puts   it - direct\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  Before  the  negotiations  ended   in   a\r\n\r\ndeadlock,  the union had already instructed its  members\r\n\r\nto  go slow. That was the thing that made the management\r\n\r\nfed  up  with the whole situation. They thought  it  was\r\n\r\nimpossible   for   them  to  tolerate   any   more   the\r\n\r\nirresponsible attitude of the union. That  is  why  they\r\n\r\nmade  up  their minds to close down. That is where  they\r\n\r\nmade  the  mistake and we had to step in, otherwise  the\r\n\r\nworkers would lose their jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. The Member was under the\r\n\r\nimpression that what the Ministry wants is that he  must\r\n\r\nrefer  all  trade  disputes,  all  negotiations  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  That is not the case, Sir. What we have  said\r\n\r\nis  that  there are conciliatory facilities. As  far  as\r\n\r\npossible,  the union and the management can have  direct\r\n\r\nnegotiations. But in case they reach a deadlock at  that\r\n\r\nstage,  they  should seek the assistance of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nConciliation Office. Otherwise, before they do that,  if\r\n\r\nthey take industrial action -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Can the Parliamentary Secretary either\r\n\r\nconfirm  or deny that employers have been told to  refer\r\n\r\ndisputes to the Ministry of Labour?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Yes. We have advised the employers\r\n\r\nto  do that. Why? It is because during this period,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Business Houses Employees Union especially had\r\n\r\ndirect negotiations. As soon as they reached a deadlock,\r\n\r\nthey  did  not refer the dispute to the Labour Ministry.\r\n\r\nThey  just  called  for  industrial  action.  Then   the\r\n\r\nemployer  had  to  come  to the Ministry  and  seek  our\r\n\r\nadvice.  We always advised the management that in  order\r\n\r\nto  avoid  that sort of situation, they should come  and\r\n\r\ninform us in advance and ask the Labour Ministry to take\r\n\r\nover  the negotiations. That is what we have asked  them\r\n\r\nto  do.  But we have never compelled an employer not  to\r\n\r\nconduct direct negotiations with the union. We say, \"Yes\r\n\r\nby  all means, have your direct negotiations. But before\r\n\r\nyou  reach  a  deadlock and seek industrial action,  the\r\n\r\ndispute  should  be  referred to  the  Commissioner  for\r\n\r\nLabour  to  see whether he would be able to assist  both\r\n\r\nparties.\" That is what we have advised the employer  and\r\n\r\nthe  union to do. It is not what the Member for  Thomson\r\n\r\nhas alleged, that is we are forcing the employer not  to\r\n\r\nconduct  direct  negotiations but to  bring  all  direct\r\n\r\nnegotiations to the Labour Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point. Mr Speaker, is about the question of a\r\n\r\nlawyer representing the management. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I\r\n\r\ndo not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  what  office the Member for Thomson  occupies  in\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U.   So  many  non-English  speaking  unions   in\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. are   objecting  to   lawyers   representing\r\n\r\nemployers  in  negotiations or in just a  normal  trade\r\n\r\ndispute. I have had occasions when they came personally\r\n\r\nand  appealed to me to advise the employers not to make\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  lawyers. If the Member for Thomson  wants\r\n\r\nit,  I  am  prepared to allow the lawyers  to  conduct\r\n\r\nnegotiations on behalf of their employer.  We  have  no\r\n\r\nobjection  to that, Sir,In fact, the Commissioner  for\r\n\r\nLabour will be too happy. Otherwise, everytime a lawyer\r\n\r\ncomes on behalf of the employer we have difficulty.

In fact, two days  ago  when\r\n\r\nthey  argued  with  me about my having  a  post  for  a\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary  in my Ministry,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson did acknowledge that in certain Ministries like\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Labour there was a genuine  necessity\r\n\r\nfor  a  liaison officer who can explain to the  workers\r\n\r\nthe  policies  concerning the Ministry of  Labour.  You\r\n\r\nmust also understand that the Ministry of Labour is  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  social  welfare  and  the  amount  of  work\r\n\r\ninvolved in social welfare is quite considerable. So  I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that the Ministry of Labour does require  a\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary  who can assist  the  Minister  in\r\n\r\nexplaining his policies to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 44 he reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of item (4) of subhead 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year there was a lot of heated debate over\r\n\r\nthis post.

You will remember, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, when the Hon, the Minister for Labour and\r\n\r\nLaw, as he then was,\r\n\r\nmoved  this Bill in the Assembly sometime, I think,  in\r\n\r\nFebruary 1960, he did\r\n\r\nmake  the  statement  that this was  something  new  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and he did not\r\n\r\nclaim  that  it was a perfect piece of legislation.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  he  would  watch  its operation  and  review  the\r\n\r\nposition   after   he   had   watched   its   operation\r\n\r\nsufficiently. He did also tell the House that there was\r\n\r\nprovision in the Ordinance for a report to be put in by\r\n\r\nthe President of the Court to\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly - a statutory obligation - which would enable\r\n\r\nthe House to assess\r\n\r\nthe quality of the work and the work as it affected the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. Unfortunately,  no  such report has  been  filed  by  the\r\n\r\nPresident  of  the  Court, and  it  is  therefore  not\r\n\r\npossible  to have his point of view on the matter.  But\r\n\r\nnaturally\r\n\r\nsome  of  us  who  have been interested  in  industrial\r\n\r\narbifration  have  been looking forward  anxiously  and\r\n\r\neagerly to seeing how the Court was functioning and\r\n\r\nwhat  effect  it  has had on the life  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nparticularly on the relation-ships   between   employers  and  employees   and   the\r\n\r\nconfidence that both these groups\r\n\r\nhave in the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I feel that our Courts of Law have established a\r\n\r\nreputation in this country for their fair-mindedness and their sense\r\n\r\nof justice; so much so  that anybody  wanting to fight anybody,\r\n\r\neven  the  poor  man wanting to fight the\r\n\r\nGovernment, says, \"Put it to the Court.\r\n\r\nLet  the  Court decide. I will be satisfied with  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the court.\" This\r\n\r\nmental  attitude sfaows the confidence and the  faith\r\n\r\nthe  people have in our courts of justice, which  is  a\r\n\r\ngood thing. The\r\n\r\nposition I had hoped the Industrial Arbitration Court\r\n\r\nwould reach soon was that\r\n\r\nit would be similarly viewed as our courts of justice\r\n\r\nare      viewed.      Mr     Speaker,      Sir, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregret to say that the impact of the Arbitration  Court\r\n\r\nupon  the public, both upon the employers and the large\r\n\r\nsections  of  workers, has not been in the direction  I\r\n\r\nhad  hoped it would be. Perhaps, Mr Speaker, it is not\r\n\r\nthe   fault  of  the  Court  nor  the  fault   of   any\r\n\r\nindividuals.  But  I am venturing  to  suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister that it is the inherent weaknesses within  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance itself that have created the situation  which\r\n\r\nhas  resulted  in  a  loss of confidence  both  by  the\r\n\r\nemploying public and the employees in the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to put the thing in its proper perspective, I\r\n\r\nwish  to  refer  to certain salient provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nConciliation and Arbitration Act, an Australian Act, by\r\n\r\nwhich our Ordinance was inspired. The Conciliation  and\r\n\r\nArbitration  Act  of Australia, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  has\r\n\r\nbeen amended up to 1959, and the position to date, as I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it,  is  this. Under the  Conciliation  and\r\n\r\nArbitration Act, two institutions are set  up.  One  is\r\n\r\nthe Commonwealth Industrial Court, which is a judicial\r\n\r\ncourt under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which\r\n\r\nhas  the  exact status of a Federal Court in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe  second  organisation under  the  Conciliation  and\r\n\r\nArbitration  Act  is the Commonwealth Conciliation  and\r\n\r\nArbitration Commission, which is not a judicial body in\r\n\r\nthe  sense  that the Commonwealth Industrial Court  is.\r\n\r\nThe function of the Commonwealth Industrial Court is to\r\n\r\ndeal with judicial matters under the Act. Mark you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  judicial matters  under  the  Act.  The\r\n\r\nfunction   of   the   Commonwealth   Conciliation   and\r\n\r\nArbitration  Commission is to handle the  functions  of\r\n\r\nconciliation  and  arbitration. So  the  Act  envisages\r\n\r\nthree   items-judicial  matters  under  the  Act,   and\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  conciliation  and  arbitration.  Between\r\n\r\nthese  two bodies the whole of the industrial  disputes\r\n\r\nis  determined.  The Commonwealth Industrial  Court  is\r\n\r\ncomposed of a Chief Judge and not more than two Judges.\r\n\r\nThe  composition  of the Commonwealth Conciliation  and\r\n\r\nArbitration  Commission, Mr Speaker, Sir, is  composed\r\n\r\nof  (a)  a  President,  (b) not less  than  two  Deputy\r\n\r\nPresidents,  (c) a senior commissioner,  (d)  not  less\r\n\r\nthan   five   commissioners  and  (e)   a   number   of\r\n\r\nconciliators. The difficulty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI   think,  we  have  reached  in  Singapore  is-and  I\r\n\r\nseriously  suggest  it - that if we do  not  amend  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance of ours, we will run into difficulties  which\r\n\r\nwill  bring  into  disfavour all our  Industrial  Court\r\n\r\nproceedings. And that would be tragic. The  difficulty\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  as  I see it, is this.  The  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration   Court,  as  we  know  it,  performs   two\r\n\r\nfunctions:  the judicial functions under the  Act,  the\r\n\r\nfunction,  not  of  conciliation, but  of  arbitration.\r\n\r\nConciliation is vested with the Commissioner for Labour\r\n\r\nand   his   conciliation  officers.  Conciliation   and\r\n\r\nconciliation officers come under the direct control  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister.  The  Minister is a political  creature.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  as soon as you introduce the  Minister  and\r\n\r\nhis   Government   officials  into   the   conciliation\r\n\r\nbusiness, the matter tends to become political, whether\r\n\r\nyou  like it or not. So long as the Member for  Thomson\r\n\r\nwas  on  that side, it was not political. But  when  he\r\n\r\ngets   to   this  side,  it  most  definitely   becomes\r\n\r\npolitical. This is what we told the Government  before.\r\n\r\nSo  long as you have all the trade unions with you, you\r\n\r\ncan  give  the  matter a semblance  of  a  trade  union\r\n\r\ndispute.  But  once you have two forces  in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion field, equally balanced, striving for trade union\r\n\r\nsupport  in  the trade union field, then  it  certainly\r\n\r\nmust become political.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter where it is definitely giving the\r\n\r\nsemblance  of  having  become  political  is  this.  In\r\n\r\nAustralia  either  party to an industrial  dispute  may\r\n\r\nrefer  a  matter  to either of these two  institutions.\r\n\r\nEither  party to the dispute, or the court  itself,  or\r\n\r\nthe  commission  itself,  could  seize  itself  of   an\r\n\r\nindustrial dispute. So you see, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nposition  in Australia is that the Act takes the  whole\r\n\r\nfield  of industrial disputes out of the hands of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  As  soon as there is a possibility  of  an\r\n\r\nindustrial  dispute, the Commonwealth Conciliation  and\r\n\r\nArbitration Commission can seize itself of the  dispute\r\n\r\nand  adjudicate  upon it. Either the  employer  or  the\r\n\r\nemployee  can  request the Conciliation  Commission  to\r\n\r\nseize  itself  of  the matter and the  Commission  must\r\n\r\nseize itself of it. Now, what is the position here?  It\r\n\r\nis  this: If the employer wants to send it on  his  own\r\n\r\nvolition he cannot do it. If the employee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwants  to  sent  it  on his own volition,  against  the\r\n\r\nwishes  of the employer, he cannot do it. Both must  go\r\n\r\nto the Minister. But if there was no -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Both must go to the court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes. Both must go jointly. That is the\r\n\r\npoint. If one of them disagreed and did not want to go,\r\n\r\nthen  the Court could not be seized of it. Where  there\r\n\r\nwas disagreement between the employer and the employee,\r\n\r\nboth of them would have to go to the Minister, and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  held  them both by the neck. It  is  so,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. I am sorry to say it is so. Then  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister refused to move, nothing could be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Thomson says that if it is a\r\n\r\nmatter concerning a Government-sponsored union,  up  it\r\n\r\ngoes   to   the  Industrial  Arbitration   Court.   The\r\n\r\nsuggestion is that the only disputes that have gone  up\r\n\r\nbefore   this  Court  are  disputes  in  which  P.A.P.-sponsored   unions   or  P.A.P.-favoured   unions   are\r\n\r\ninvolved. That is the accusation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not necessarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It could be, even if the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nhas  not  said it yet. He will say it one  day - most  as\r\n\r\nsuredly,  he  will - because the system lends  itself  to\r\n\r\nsuch  an accusation. There are matters connected purely\r\n\r\nwith  the  law:  I do not know whether  they  now  come\r\n\r\nwithin  the  ambit of the Commissioner  for  Labour  or\r\n\r\nwhether  they  come within the ambit of the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Industrial Court\r\n\r\ncovers questions relating to the dismissal or injury of\r\n\r\nan   employee   on   account  of   industrial   action;\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  awards  made  by  the  Commonwealth\r\n\r\nConciliation  and  Arbitration  Commission;   questions\r\n\r\nconcerning    eligibility   of   membership    of    an\r\n\r\norganisation; disputes between an organisation and  its\r\n\r\nmembers;   power  to  hold  inquiries   into   disputed\r\n\r\nelections; matters relating to the cancellation of an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisation.  It  is rather an important  question -\r\n\r\nmatters   relating   to   the   cancellation   of    an\r\n\r\norganisation.  Now  on  this  particular   issue,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, this matter is entirely within the  power\r\n\r\nof the Minister in Singapore. The exercise of that power\r\n\r\nhas  resulted in one strike and it could have  resulted\r\n\r\nin  another strike, but the Government was wise  enough\r\n\r\nto step back a bit, and that was settled. Now what I am\r\n\r\nsuggesting  to the Minister is this. Let  us  put  this\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Ordinance on a proper  footing.\r\n\r\nLet us not tinker with it. Let us not say, \"let us give\r\n\r\nthe Court half of the powers, let the Minister maintain\r\n\r\nthe  other  half of the powers,\" and so give industrial\r\n\r\narbitration a political flavour. Let us not do it.  Let\r\n\r\nus take it outside the ambit of the Minister's control.\r\n\r\nI entirely agree with the Government that there is need\r\n\r\nfor  such an Ordinance in Singapore, but let us  create\r\n\r\nit  in such a way that it will not be possible for  any\r\n\r\nsection of the public to accuse the Government of using\r\n\r\nit  for  its own political ends. If anybody is accusing\r\n\r\nthe Government of so doing it is because the scheme  of\r\n\r\nthings  under  the Industrial Arbitration Ordinance  is\r\n\r\nsuch that the Government are open to such accusations.\r\n\r\nAll  I  am asking the Government to do now is  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister to reconsider the whole position, as  he  said\r\n\r\nhe would when he moved the Second Reading of this Bill;\r\n\r\nand   I  tm  suggesting  to  him  that  we  follow  the\r\n\r\nAustralian system more closely. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  let\r\n\r\nus  not  throw  the Australian scheme  overboard.  This\r\n\r\nscheme has been arrived at in Australia after years  of\r\n\r\nexperience.  It  now works there and  I  take  it  that\r\n\r\ndisputes  in the industrial field whether in Singapore,\r\n\r\nAustralia or in Timbuctoo take the same economic  turn.\r\n\r\nIt  is not a question of white, black or yellow in this\r\n\r\nmatter.  It is a question of economics and it tends  to\r\n\r\ngo  in  one  particular  direction.  So  let  us  avail\r\n\r\nourselves  of  the  Australian experience  and  try  to\r\n\r\nformulate  legislation which will take away the  entire\r\n\r\nfield  of  conciliation and put it in the  hands  of  a\r\n\r\ncommission; and under the procedures laid down  in  the\r\n\r\nConciliation and Arbitration Act, it is possible for an\r\n\r\nappeal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  moved  from  the decision of  one  Conciliation\r\n\r\nCommissioner to a full Court of Appeal under the Board.\r\n\r\nThere may be a slight delay, I agree, but this tends to\r\n\r\ncreate  confidence. The important thing  in  all  these\r\n\r\nmatters is confidence. If people have confidence  in  a\r\n\r\nthing, they will take to it. Once they lose confidence,\r\n\r\nthen the whole position is lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I beg of the Minister to review the whole matter\r\n\r\nin  the  light of what our Court has done.

I have here, Sir, the Free Press\r\n\r\nof   Saturday  with  a  report  of  the  views  of  the\r\n\r\nAustralian  Labour Disputes Commissioner, Mr  Potters,\r\n\r\nand I think his suggestions are very pertinent. He says\r\n\r\nthat  in Australia the Arbitration Court settled  about\r\n\r\n90  per cent of the Labour disputes and that the  Court\r\n\r\nshould  be  composed  of independent  people  with  no\r\n\r\nconnection  with any political Party. Sir, I  think  we\r\n\r\nneed  to benefit from the experience of people in other\r\n\r\ncountries and we need it badly at this time. I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government should not be too self-complacent\r\n\r\nabout  it and that it would take advantage of what  has\r\n\r\nhappened elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the present Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  has  not  got the capacity to  deal  with  cases\r\n\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a queue of six already and when I spoke to one\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leader  about  settling  his  dispute  by\r\n\r\nreferring it to the Court, he said, \"Well, there are so\r\n\r\nmany cases waiting. If I were to refer the case to  the\r\n\r\nCourt,  I would have to wait for ages.\" I suggest  that\r\n\r\nthere should be another Court established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have gone over all\r\n\r\nthis  ground before. I cannot agree with the submission\r\n\r\nof the Member for Farrer Park that because conciliation\r\n\r\nproceedings  take  place  in  the  Ministry,  there  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  essentially a political bias.  That  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue.  When  a  dispute reaches the Arbitration  Court,\r\n\r\nwhether by a reference from the Minister or by a joint\r\n\r\nreference  by  both parties, the Court  still  has  the\r\n\r\npower to remit the case for further conciliation if  it\r\n\r\nfinds   that  there  is  still  room  for,   say,   the\r\n\r\ncontinuation of negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have explained this in the Second\r\n\r\nReading  debate on the Industrial Relations  Bill.  The\r\n\r\nfunction  of the Court, as we see it, is not  really  a\r\n\r\njudicial process. It is more a legislative process.  In\r\n\r\nconciliation  proceedings,  the  Ministry  offers   its\r\n\r\nservices   to   both   sides.  When  negotiations   are\r\n\r\ndeadlocked,  it tries to get both sides  to  reach  an\r\n\r\nagreement.  When it fails, then the matter is  remitted\r\n\r\nto  the  Arbitration Court and the Court then tries  to\r\n\r\nget the parties together to reach an agreement. Now  if\r\n\r\nthe  Court  cannot get the parties to agree,  then  the\r\n\r\nonly alternative is for the Court to make the agreement\r\n\r\nfor the parties. That is not a judicial process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I know there are certain groups of\r\n\r\nunions  which do not like this Court any more  than  do\r\n\r\ncertain   employers.  Certain  employers   dislike   it\r\n\r\nimmensely,  because it has given decisions  which  they\r\n\r\ndislike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the practice in the Australian\r\n\r\nCourt,  as I know it, is quite unlike the procedure  in\r\n\r\nour  Court.  There  is  no system  of  Registration  of\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements  in  the  Australian   practice.\r\n\r\nCollective  agreements are not required by  law  to  be\r\n\r\ncertified and registered by the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I know, a greater majority\r\n\r\nof  agreements  are  entered  into  freely  between  the\r\n\r\nparties,  and it is these agreements which are certified\r\n\r\nand registered. The disputes are a very small proportion\r\n\r\nof  the  number of agreements registered.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  before  we  can make any review of the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Ordinance, I am awaiting the report  from  the\r\n\r\nPresident  under section 83 of the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the need for a second Court is concerned,\r\n\r\nthere  is now a backlog developing and when we  proceed\r\n\r\nto  amend  this  Ordinance, we  shall  provide  for  the\r\n\r\nappointment of a Deputy President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time has expired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $171,330 for Head 45 ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 46-\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in\r\n\r\nthe name of Inche Ahmad Jabri bin Mohammad Akib -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head 46 be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Ahmad Jabri is not here.

Though their employment  is  temporary,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  employed as long  as  the  Board  is  in\r\n\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the accusation that the Secretary of the Board\r\n\r\nis  biased,  I have so far not received any  complaints\r\n\r\nagainst him. However, all the staff have to work  under\r\n\r\nthe Board which is composed of representatives from the\r\n\r\nunion, the employer and the Government. I am sure  that\r\n\r\nif  the Board receives any complaint of dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nwith these persons in the discharge of their duties, it\r\n\r\nwill  look  into  it. And if it is found  to  be  true,\r\n\r\nnaturally steps will be taken to meet the complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the \"Fees for Chairman and\r\n\r\nAdditor\" - item (4) of subhead 9 - Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nposition is this. Previously the Chairman of the  Board\r\n\r\nwas  Mr  G. H. Kiat and he was paid a fee of $500  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  On 15th October, 1959, the Government appointed\r\n\r\nCaptain Pavitt to be Chairman of the Board. He is also\r\n\r\nthe Master Attendant. He was appointed as Chairman in a\r\n\r\npersonal capacity, and not as a Government servant.  So\r\n\r\nCapt.  Pavitt was performing his duties over and  above\r\n\r\nhis   functions  as  Master  Attendant  and  ex-officio\r\n\r\nChairman of other Government statutory boards for which\r\n\r\nhe  receives no fees, and it was decided that he should\r\n\r\nbe  paid  a  fee  of $200 a month as  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nSeamen's Registry Board. This accounts for the $2,400 a\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Auditor, he is a Government\r\n\r\nauditor.  The  auditor's  fee  is  $500,  and   it   is\r\n\r\nunderstood now that the Government auditor has  reduced\r\n\r\nhis fee to $250. That is why there is a decrease in the\r\n\r\nEstimates for this item for next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the recruitment of\r\n\r\nseamen for the Catering Department, it is not true that\r\n\r\nthe   Board  is  discriminatory  against  Malay  seamen\r\n\r\nworking  in the Catering Department. The main point  is\r\n\r\nthat  in the Catering Department the employees have  to\r\n\r\nhandle  pork.  This  problem was therefore  brought  up\r\n\r\nofficially  by  the  Seamen's  Registry  Board  to  the\r\n\r\nMuslims  Advisory  Board. The  Muslims  Advisory  Board\r\n\r\nstrongly  advised the Seamen's Registry  Board  not  to\r\n\r\nencourage or induce Malay and Muslim employees to  work\r\n\r\nin  the  Catering Department where they have to  handle\r\n\r\npork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the selection of candidates for\r\n\r\ntraining as stewards, the point is this, Sir.  Most  of\r\n\r\nthe people who have been seamen and have experience are\r\n\r\nnot very keen to register themselves for training. From\r\n\r\nthat point of view, we have to invite applications from\r\n\r\npeople who have never been to sea to be trained and  to\r\n\r\nbe employed in the Catering Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

If I am not mistaken,  the\r\n\r\nnew  recruits  numbers less than a  thousand  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens. Which category of citizens is that?

As far  as  procedure  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,   whenever  any  person  is   required   for\r\n\r\ntraining,   an   advertisement  is  inserted   in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  A  Committee comprising the  employer  and\r\n\r\nGovernment   representatives   will   look   into   the\r\n\r\napplications,  interview  the  candidates,  and  select\r\n\r\nsuitable  candidates for training.

It is  all\r\n\r\nadjusted  in  accordance  with  the  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nemployment  at any particular time. If there  are  more\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  employment, more registered  seamen\r\n\r\nare  employed, and then only does the Board add to  the\r\n\r\nlist  of  new  entrants.

The Government has  now  taken\r\n\r\nover  the  functions of the City Council. By virtue  of\r\n\r\nthat,  they  should now be maintaining the Jalan  Besar\r\n\r\nStadium  and the Farrer Park running track. I have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  to  the Jalan Besar Stadium recently. But  I  was\r\n\r\nthere  some three months ago. The condition of some  of\r\n\r\nthe stands at the Jalan Besar Stadium is deplorable.  I\r\n\r\nwas wondering whether any particular Ministry is really\r\n\r\ninterested  in the amenities this stadium provides.  It\r\n\r\nused to provide, Mr Speaker, Sir, fairly large sums of\r\n\r\nmoney by way of revenue to the City Council. I dare say\r\n\r\nthat  similar  sums are being obtained from  the  Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar  Stadium which now go into the Consolidated Fund.\r\n\r\nI do ask the Minister in charge of Parks and Recreation\r\n\r\nnot  to  forget the Jalan Besar Stadium because  it  is\r\n\r\nabout  the  only  decent football  ground  we  have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Not only are our State matches played there,\r\n\r\nbut  international visiting teams also, when they  play\r\n\r\nmatches  in  Singapore, do play those  matches  at  the\r\n\r\nstadium.  Therefore, it is not only  from  the  amenity\r\n\r\npoint  of  view of Singapore that it is important  that\r\n\r\nthe stadium should be kept properly appointed, but also\r\n\r\nfrom   the   prestige  point  of  view,   so   far   as\r\n\r\ninternational touring teams are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is the Farrer Park running\r\n\r\ntrack. The land there was acquired by the City Council\r\n\r\nfrom the Trust and laid out at some expense, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder  that  it  might provide amenities  for  athletes\r\n\r\nwhich were not available to them. As far as I am aware,\r\n\r\nSir, when I was in the City Council, the track was well\r\n\r\nmaintained  and  there  were  no  complaints  from  the\r\n\r\nathletes. I now understand the tracks are so hard  that\r\n\r\nno  amount of spikes, however sharp they may  be,  will\r\n\r\nenter  the ground. I myself have not been there, but  I\r\n\r\nhave  been  told of this by the athletes  who  use  the\r\n\r\ntracks. I have no reason to doubt their statement  that\r\n\r\nit  is impossible for them to train there. Some of  our\r\n\r\nathletes  are  now in the S.E.A.P. Games competing  and\r\n\r\ntrying  to  bring  Singapore on  the  sporting  map.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand   Government  has  also   contributed   some\r\n\r\n$60,000, for which, I am told, the athletes are  really\r\n\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> $16,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> $16,000 - I beg your pardon. I knew the\r\n\r\nGovernment was generous, but I did not realise  it  was\r\n\r\nthat  generous. But the point I am trying to make, Sir,\r\n\r\nis  that all this money is ill spent if facilities  for\r\n\r\ntraining for our athletes are not available. The Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  running track was perhaps the only one which  was\r\n\r\navailable. I do not think we should let the  track  run\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, there is one\r\n\r\npoint here I would like to stress. We would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Government to consider amending the Parks  by-laws\r\n\r\nand  regulations governing the use of parks.  My  Party\r\n\r\napplied for permission to use Hong Lim and Towner Parks\r\n\r\nfor political rallies. Although the police did not give\r\n\r\nus any trouble over our applications, the. Park by-laws\r\n\r\nand  regulations though were quite obstructive, and  we\r\n\r\nwere  not able to hold these mass rallies. In  view  of\r\n\r\nthe   Government's   contention  and   assurance   that\r\n\r\ndemocracy should be given full play, and in view of the\r\n\r\nfact  that Government want to allow us full freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech  and discussion, I would urge them to look  into\r\n\r\nthese old by-laws and consider amending them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Upper Serangoon is not\r\n\r\nhere. Dr Goh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> First, the Jalan Besar Stadium. I\r\n\r\nhave not been there for years. But like the Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park, I do get reports, and the reports have not\r\n\r\nbeen  too  favourable. Bits of roof are  falling  down.\r\n\r\nGenerally,  the standard of comfort there is  not  what\r\n\r\none  would  expect of a modern city like Singapore.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, something has to be done about it. The question\r\n\r\nis what has got to be done about it? When the Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan was first conceived, various proposals\r\n\r\nwere  made.  The  Jalan  Besar  Stadium  was  discussed\r\n\r\nbecause   it   was   inadequate  to  provide   sporting\r\n\r\nfacilities that a modern city needs. Unfortunately,  at\r\n\r\nthat time, the alternative put forward for inclusion in\r\n\r\nthe plan was the building of a really grandiose stadium\r\n\r\nsomewhere  around Bukit Batok. This was a  tremendously\r\n\r\nexpensive  scheme and was rejected from  the  Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan because it was too expensive  and  too\r\n\r\nfar  away, and we thought that perhaps some renovations\r\n\r\nto  the  Jalan Besar Stadium would meet the point.  But\r\n\r\nsince then, of course, we have had to pay attention  to\r\n\r\nmore   urgent   matters.  This  aspect  of   developing\r\n\r\namenities for the city was neglected. I think the  time\r\n\r\nhas  come, and we are grateful to the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  for  bringing up this point to  us.  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  have a second think about this matter. What  is\r\n\r\nthe  best way of doing it? I am not quite sure. We have\r\n\r\nto  get opinions from experts and evaluate alternatives\r\n\r\nbefore we come to a decision. I think we have to decide\r\n\r\nvery  soon.  After all, our neighbouring countries  are\r\n\r\npressing on. Kuala Lumpur has the Merdeka Stadium,  and\r\n\r\nis  pressing on with another one. Djarkata will have  a\r\n\r\n$100 million covered stadium. Although one regrets that\r\n\r\nmoney  has  to  be  spent on these things - it  does  not\r\n\r\nprovide future employment prospects - I think there is  a\r\n\r\ncase for a review of the whole position. If indeed,  it\r\n\r\nseems  that the track at Farrer Park has gone down,  if\r\n\r\nit  has  deteriorated through neglect and not  through,\r\n\r\nthe  drought, then I think the matter is quite  urgent.\r\n\r\nApart from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat,  I am afraid I am not in a position to give  more\r\n\r\nconcrete assurances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as for the point raised by the Member for Nee\r\n\r\nSoon,  I  am glad to hear that he acknowledges that  we\r\n\r\nare leaning backwards to be democratic. We have allowed\r\n\r\nthem,  within  the  rules of the  game,  all  the  mass\r\n\r\nmeetings they need, or the mass meetings that they have\r\n\r\napplied  for.  But  when it comes  to  playgrounds  and\r\n\r\nchildren's parks, we have to balance interests.  If  we\r\n\r\nallow  a  mass meeting to be held in these playgrounds,\r\n\r\nit  does mean, Mr Speaker, Sir, depriving children and\r\n\r\nparents  of  the use of the parks for that evening.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the Barisan Sosialis may say that the  message\r\n\r\nthey  want to put across to the people of Singapore  is\r\n\r\nso  urgent  and  so  important that  it  outweighs  any\r\n\r\ntemporary inconvenience which we have to impose on  the\r\n\r\nchildren and parents. But I say that that is a  trivial\r\n\r\nissue.  Government,  of course, does  not  accept  that\r\n\r\npoint  of view. Therefore, in our opinion, the  by-laws\r\n\r\nof  the  City  Council governing the use of  parks  and\r\n\r\nchildren's playgrounds should stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the explanation\r\n\r\nof  the Minister for Finance does not answer our point.\r\n\r\nFor instance, let us come to Hong Lim Green. It was the\r\n\r\nplace  in  which, if I remember correctly,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfired   its   first  salvo  against  the   old   S.P.A.\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Not so very long ago, we  had  a  big  by-election in Hong Lim, and I do remember the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong Lim managed to get a huge crowd to that place  for\r\n\r\nhis mass rallies. The Government also held two or three\r\n\r\nmass  rallies there and found that they were  not  very\r\n\r\nwell  attended.  It might very well  be  that,  because\r\n\r\nGovernment feels that it might not be able to fill  the\r\n\r\nplace  should it hold a mass rally there and  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis might very well fill the place  over-brimmingly, it thinks there is no need  to  revise  or\r\n\r\namend the regulations. Mr Speaker, Sir, I think if  we\r\n\r\nhad  a  mass rally, the children as well as the parents\r\n\r\nwould  have  as much fun as, nay, much more  fun  than,\r\n\r\nthey  would  usually have, because of the exposures  of\r\n\r\nthe Government and all its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnefarious  activities.  I  would  seriously   urge   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to reconsider amending these regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point about the Jalan Besar Stadium is this.\r\n\r\nSince  the  Minister  has given an  assurance  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   looking  into  the  possibilities   of\r\n\r\nrepairing  the stadium - I hesitate to suggest, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nit  is  really  serious about sports and  recreation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  - it  is not the Jalan Besar Stadium  that  it\r\n\r\nshould  rebuild or repair, but it should  build  a  new\r\n\r\nstadium  in a much bigger place with a bigger  stand.  A\r\n\r\nvery  good  suggestion is to convert the present  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  into  a brand-new stadium. When I was a member  on\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Amateur Sports Council, I suggested  that\r\n\r\nit  would  be  best  to build a stadium  with  aid  from\r\n\r\nGovernment, say, on a dollar to dollar basis,  and  with\r\n\r\ncontributions from the public. The Sports  Council  did\r\n\r\nget  going on this project. Actually we visited the site\r\n\r\nonce   or   twice,  but  somehow,  after  I   left   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, my name was automatically left out  of  the\r\n\r\nSports Council, and that was the last we heard about the\r\n\r\nstadium.  Should  the  Minister for  Finance  feel  like\r\n\r\nreviving  the  whole  idea, I  do  not  mind  giving  my\r\n\r\nservices  for  sports  and for recreation  and  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. Perhaps the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nwill think about that one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I will think about that one\r\n\r\nand  a  lot of others! But coming back to this  meeting.\r\n\r\nFirst,  during the Hong Lim by-election, mass  meetings\r\n\r\nwere,  of course, held from 7 o'clock onwards, when  the\r\n\r\npeople  have had their dinner and the children  were  no\r\n\r\nlonger  playing on the fields or had left  off  playing.\r\n\r\nOutside  the  election  period  or  by-election  period,\r\n\r\npublic  meetings can only be held during  the  hours  of 5.00  p.m. to 7.00 p.m. Of course, \r\n\r\nif mass meetings  are\r\n\r\nheld  there, children could be deprived of  the  use  of\r\n\r\nthese  facilities. However, Sir, I am reassured to  hear\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Member for Nee Soon that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nmass  meetings  would  provide an  uproarious  time  for\r\n\r\nchildren and their parents. Of course, it would, because\r\n\r\nthe utter absurdity of their propositions cannot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfail  but  draw laughter all round. While I can  commend\r\n\r\nthis  light-hearted approach to politics as an  argument\r\n\r\nin  favour of allowing parks to be used during the  time\r\n\r\nchildren  want  to use them, because the children  would\r\n\r\nenjoy  the mass meetings and laugh louder than  if  they\r\n\r\nwere  playing in sand pits, I do not think that  is  the\r\n\r\npurpose  for which the Barisan Socialis hold their  mass\r\n\r\nmeetings. They have a more serious purpose, and if  they\r\n\r\nprovoked  laughter and merriment, I suggest to you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, it is not because they intended to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is typical of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to shift the issue when they get caught.  It\r\n\r\nis  no  laughing matter, Sir,It is nothing trivial.  If\r\n\r\nthe people come to our mass rallies, and enjoy coming to\r\n\r\nour  mass  rallies - as they did  only  yesterday - it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  we  could explain the issues to the  people  in\r\n\r\nsimple  common language; it is because we can expose  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  the  nefarious  activities  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  in  the  Government. If they  feel  there  is\r\n\r\nsomething to laugh at - well, some people like to laugh at\r\n\r\ntragedy, and if the people want to laugh at the  tragedy\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. Government, I do not see why they should\r\n\r\nbe stopped from laughing. After all, they can either cry\r\n\r\nor  laugh; and under the P.A.P. Government they  can  do\r\n\r\neither one of those things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, if the argument is that if the meetings\r\n\r\nare  held  from  5 p.m. to 7 p.m. it would  deprive  the\r\n\r\nchildren  of  the facilities offered by the  playground,\r\n\r\nmight I advise the Minister to look into the possibility\r\n\r\nof  lifting  this  ban of not having  meetings  after  7\r\n\r\no'clock? In the Federation of Malaya, mass meetings  are\r\n\r\nallowed  at  night.  I  see no  reason,  Sir,  why  mass\r\n\r\nmeetings  should not be allowed at night  here.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister's argument holds good, that if the meetings are\r\n\r\nheld at night the children will not be deprived of their\r\n\r\nplaying  time between 5 and 7 p.m., I would  commend  to\r\n\r\nhim  the suggestion to amend the police regulations  and\r\n\r\nallow mass meetings to be held after 7 o'clock so that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe can kill two birds with one stone.

As  if  it\r\n\r\ncan  be a silly thing put forward by the Member for Nee\r\n\r\nSoon,  which  was, that he thinks his Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nmust  think  it is glorious fun for kids.  I  say, of\r\n\r\ncourse, if that is so, then we must think seriously -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This is repetition, Mr Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now as regards the lifting of the\r\n\r\ntime-table, the Member for Thomson says if  you  cannot\r\n\r\nhold  mass  meetings before 7 p.m., it is undemocratic;\r\n\r\nafter  7  p.m., it is democratic. Sir, we  have  always\r\n\r\nsuspected  and  we have said that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  always been night birds. Why do they want to have\r\n\r\nmeetings, after midnight? There you are, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.  But  to say that democracy depends on  just  what\r\n\r\ntime  to  hold mass meetings, to me there  is  no  more\r\n\r\nludicruous proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The truth is that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nnowadays  dare  not  meet the people.  They  have  been\r\n\r\nsaying that we did not hold any more rallies after the first  two. The real reason is simply that we were  not\r\n\r\ngiven the opportunity to hold rallies.

The  Director of  Social  Welfare  now  has\r\n\r\nresponsibilities for three kinds of works, in  addition\r\n\r\nto work in relation to Social Welfare, he has to be the\r\n\r\nActing  Administrative Officer  of  the  City  Council,\r\n\r\nwhere  his duties are also heavy. At the same time,  he\r\n\r\nis  also  the  Secretary and Treasurer of the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation. He has to shoulder three kinds of  duties.\r\n\r\nDuring  the present strike by the staff' of the  People\r\n\r\nAssociation, the Secretary made a statement  which  was\r\n\r\nfull  of  political colour, it may be due to  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat he has many duties to shoulder. That is why he did\r\n\r\nnot keep his status as a civil servant by making such a\r\n\r\npolitical statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the Member\r\n\r\nfor Pasir Panjang wants to do is to accuse the Director\r\n\r\nof  Social Welfare of being biased against  those  ex-employees of the People's Association who went to a so-called  strike.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  true  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Social Welfare holds three  appointments,\r\n\r\nbut   as  far  as  the  appointment  of  Secretary  and\r\n\r\nTreasurer of the People's Association is concerned,  he\r\n\r\nis  appointed  because, under the People's  Association\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  he  is  to be appointed  as  Secretary  and\r\n\r\nTreasurer  of the Association. We quite appreciate  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Pasir Panjang's anxiety over this  officer\r\n\r\nbeing  over-worked.  But  as far  as  this  officer  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  he has been carrying out his work  properly\r\n\r\nand has not made any complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allegation that he has been\r\n\r\npolitically biased, the position is this, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir. He is the Secretary and Treasurer of the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation   and  is  merely  an  employee   of   this\r\n\r\nAssociation.  So  whatever statement he  makes  in  the\r\n\r\nPress  is  not his own. It is merely the  view  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard.  He  just carries out instructions.  So  in  any\r\n\r\norganisation whatever statements are to be issued would\r\n\r\nnormally be issued through the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am just wondering under whose\r\n\r\nMinistry the People's Association comes. I am not quite\r\n\r\ncertain.

May I explain, Sir? All the\r\n\r\nfinancial   provisions  are  made  under   the   Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry,  but  as  far  as  the  management   of   the\r\n\r\nAssociation is concerned, it is managed by the Board of\r\n\r\nManagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point I was trying to get at is\r\n\r\nwhether  or not this is the proper Head under which  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the  People's Association as such.

Therefore, since  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association comes under  the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment, personal emoluments are provided under  the\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare Department. The management of the  staff\r\n\r\nand  the administration of the People's Association  is\r\n\r\nby the managerial board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Parliamentary Secretary point\r\n\r\nout   where   the  emoluments  are  for  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation?
