The industry has recommended  to  the  ERC\r\n\r\nsetting   up  Universal  Processing  Centres  (UPCs)   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to leverage our strengths and to  support  our\r\n\r\nefforts   to  develop  front,  middle  and  back   office\r\n\r\nactivities here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government supports in principle the set-up of\r\n\r\nUPCs.   The  hubbing  of  higher  value-added  processing\r\n\r\nactivities  in Singapore will create jobs,  and  generate\r\n\r\nspin-offs  to  other economic sectors, such  as  business\r\n\r\nadvisory,  IT and telecommunications. Global corporations\r\n\r\nand  financial institutions are among the early  adopters\r\n\r\nwho   have   consolidated   processing   along   business\r\n\r\nfunctions,   and   also  centralised  processing   either\r\n\r\nglobally or regionally in the American, European or Asian\r\n\r\ntime-zones.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well-placed to become a key processing\r\n\r\nhub  in  Asia.

The main\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  our  public  sector   hospitals   and\r\n\r\ninstitutions  is to provide Singaporeans, especially  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  and  lower  income groups,  good  and  affordable\r\n\r\nhealthcare that is appropriate to needs. In this respect,\r\n\r\nour   public   sector  hospitals  have  done   well   and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have over the years grown to expect  to  be\r\n\r\ntreated  by  competent staff using the latest procedures,\r\n\r\ndrugs and equipment in our public sector hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue to provide quality healthcare, public\r\n\r\nsector  hospitals must be responsive to medical advances,\r\n\r\ndemographic changes and also able to retain good staff by\r\n\r\noffering   competitive  remuneration.  These  initiatives\r\n\r\nwould,   however,  inevitably  increase  their  operating\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MP for Holland-Bukit Panjang GRC had asked for a\r\n\r\ncomparison  of  the operating cost of our hospitals  with\r\n\r\nthose of other countries. Unfortunately, such data is not\r\n\r\nreadily  available or comparable as hospitals may  differ\r\n\r\nin  their accounting treatment, size and casemix. If  we,\r\n\r\nhowever, consider total healthcare expenditure, Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  whole spends only 3% of its GDP on healthcare when\r\n\r\nother  developed  countries spend 7% or more.  Our  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on health per capita for 2000  was  S$1,500.\r\n\r\nThis  is  much  lower than the per capita expenditure  of\r\n\r\ncountries such as United Kingdom (S$3,092), United States\r\n\r\n(S$8,243) and New Zealand (S$1,890)1.  In fact, the World\r\n\r\nHealth  Report  published in 2000  by  the  World  Health\r\n\r\nOrganisation  ranked our health system  sixth  among  191\r\n\r\ncountries in overall cost effectiveness. This is a strong\r\n\r\nindication  that our healthcare delivery system  provides\r\n\r\ngood value for money to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our two public sector healthcare clusters are not-for-profit entities. As not-for-profit entities, their\r\n\r\nmain  objective is not to maximise profits. However, like\r\n\r\nany other operating entity, public sector\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<br><br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on exchange rate of 1.78S$ per US$.  Our total expenditure on health per capita for 2000 was US$843. Based on OECD Health Data 2002 total health expenditure per capita for 2000 for comparative countries are as follows: United Kingdom (US$1737), United States (US$4631) and New Zealand (US$1062).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhospitals need to exercise financial prudence and recover\r\n\r\ncost to ensure their continued viability. Otherwise, over\r\n\r\ntime, standards will decline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Singaporeans will have to pay for the increase\r\n\r\nin  healthcare cost, the Ministry of Health has  taken  a\r\n\r\nfour-pronged  approach  to minimise  the  impact  on  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, by having small, regular fee increases.\r\n\r\nRestructured  hospitals conduct annual reviews  of  their\r\n\r\ncosts,  and  review their fees and charges  regularly  to\r\n\r\nbetter  reflect  their cost profile. In  the  recent  fee\r\n\r\nrevision, the quantum of hospital fee increase  has  been\r\n\r\nkept  quite small, around $20 for class C wards  and  $40\r\n\r\nfor  class  B2 wards, which most Singaporeans  should  be\r\n\r\nable  to meet through Medisave.  For the hospitals,  this\r\n\r\ntranslates   into   an  increased  total   revenue   from\r\n\r\nsubsidised patients of around $12 million a year,  or  3%\r\n\r\nof their revenue from subsidised patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, by subsidising healthcare for the middle and\r\n\r\nlower  income  Singaporeans. MOH has put in place  target\r\n\r\nsubsidies  for  the different ward classes and  services.\r\n\r\nFor  example, inpatients are subsidised 80% for C and 65%\r\n\r\nfor  B2 class wards. The subsidy rate for day surgery  is\r\n\r\n65%  while the subsidy rate for SOC is 50%.  Our  figures\r\n\r\nshow  that  MOH has more than met its target obligations.\r\n\r\nFor example, in FY 01, MOH's subvention was 80.5% and 69%\r\n\r\nof the total C class and B2 class charges respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans pay only for the services that they\r\n\r\nuse. The Government provides additional subvention to the\r\n\r\nhospitals for teaching, training and research activities.\r\n\r\nFull Government funding is also provided for building  or\r\n\r\nupgrading hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of Singaporeans, they should choose\r\n\r\ntheir  ward  class  wisely according to  their  financial\r\n\r\nmeans.  To help Singaporeans make that choice, financial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncounselling services are mandatory at all hospitals.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  also  produced a  brochure  \"Ten  Tips  to\r\n\r\nStretch   Your  Health  Dollar\"  to  help  lower   income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  access  the heavily  subsidised  healthcare\r\n\r\nservices in the public healthcare system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, by helping Singaporeans to save for their\r\n\r\nhealthcare needs through Medisave. Several concerns  have\r\n\r\nbeen  raised  about the timing of the fee  revisions  and\r\n\r\nwhether the implementation can be postponed. As the  last\r\n\r\nfee  revision  was  in  February 2001,  the  current  fee\r\n\r\nrevision  has  already been postponed  by  at  least  six\r\n\r\nmonths. Singaporeans must, however, also understand  that\r\n\r\nthe  approach  to paying their share of healthcare  costs\r\n\r\nmust  be  through  long  term  savings,  complemented  by\r\n\r\nappropriate medical insurance plans. This is why we  have\r\n\r\nput in place Medisave, which helps Singaporeans build  up\r\n\r\na  sufficient sum of money over many years to fund  their\r\n\r\nhealthcare expenses in the future.  Singaporeans can also\r\n\r\nuse  their  Medisave  to pay their  MediShield  premiums,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  help  to  further  defray  their  healthcare\r\n\r\nexpenses  especially  if they suffer serious/catastrophic\r\n\r\nillness.  For subsidised patients, 70% of C and B2  Class\r\n\r\nbills  are  entirely met using a combination of  Medisave\r\n\r\nand MediShield, with zero out-of-pocket payment needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, by providing a safety net. Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nstill  cannot  afford to pay the highly subsidised  rates\r\n\r\neven  after using their Medisave and MediShield can apply\r\n\r\nfor  Medifund.   Medical Social Workers in the  hospitals\r\n\r\nare   also  given  the  flexibility  to  extend  Medifund\r\n\r\nassistance  to those who need help. So far, the  approval\r\n\r\nrate  of  Medifund applications has consistently remained\r\n\r\nabove  99%.  With Government subsidies, the 3M  financing\r\n\r\nframework (Medisave, MediShield and Medifund), is able to\r\n\r\npay  for  97%  of the total charges for B2  and  C  class\r\n\r\npatients. Therefore, my Ministry believes that the  small\r\n\r\nfee   increases  are  manageable  for  the  majority   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MP for Jalan Besar and MP for Hougang have asked if\r\n\r\nour hospitals can be run more efficiently. The answer is:\r\n\r\nYes. There is always room for improvement.  Public sector\r\n\r\nhospitals   must   be   managed  efficiently   and   cost\r\n\r\ncontainment should become part of the hospital management\r\n\r\nculture,  both  among administrators and  clinicians.  My\r\n\r\nMinistry has restructured our public sector hospitals  to\r\n\r\ngive  them more autonomy so that they are more responsive\r\n\r\nto  the  market and therefore achieve better cost control\r\n\r\nand productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hospitals have introduced numerous initiatives,\r\n\r\nboth  big  and  small, to improve their productivity  and\r\n\r\nmanage  their  cost.  These include  bulk  purchasing  of\r\n\r\ndrugs, improving process flows such as offering same  day\r\n\r\nadmission  for  surgery. The clusters have also  obtained\r\n\r\nsignificant savings by  outsourcing of services  such  as\r\n\r\ncatering and promoting greater energy efficiency as  well\r\n\r\nas  getting their staff to multitask. The hospitals  have\r\n\r\nalso   introduced  innovative  measures  to  lower  their\r\n\r\noverheads.  For  example,  SNEC  has  sought  to  improve\r\n\r\nutilisation and reduce fixed overheads through  marketing\r\n\r\nexcess   OT  facilities/consultation  rooms  to  non-SNEC\r\n\r\nOphthalmologists.   All these measures  have  saved  both\r\n\r\nclusters several million dollars each year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must, however, also be realistic as to\r\n\r\nthe  extent  to which hospitals can keep cost down  while\r\n\r\ncontinuing   to   maintain  healthcare   standards.    If\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  expect the best treatment and  diagnostics,\r\n\r\nshort queues and good services, they must be prepared  to\r\n\r\npay for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we try our best to control cost, it is\r\n\r\ninevitable  that cost will increase each year.   Even  in\r\n\r\nthe  prevailing economic situation, based  on  MOM  data,\r\n\r\nbasic  wages showed an average increase of 2.9%  for  all\r\n\r\nemployees  in 2001.  Taking into account the 4 percentage\r\n\r\npoints  restoration in employer's CPF  contribution,  the\r\n\r\nchange   in   overall   wage  costs   (comprising   staff\r\n\r\nremuneration and employer's CPF contribution) amounted to\r\n\r\n5.2% in 2001.  Drug costs will also continue to increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe average growth rate in prescription only medicine  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   from  1997  to  2000  was  nearly   8%.    In\r\n\r\ncomparison, the projected drug price inflation of the  US\r\n\r\nhealthcare system is even higher at 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I would like to give my assurance that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health is and will continue to work with\r\n\r\npublic sector hospitals to minimise the cost increases to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   I would also like to assure  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat no Singaporean will be denied essential medical care\r\n\r\nbecause of his inability to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nobject to being referred to as Jalan \"Bazaar\" GRC MP.

Therefore, can the Ministry of Health  not  give\r\n\r\nmore  subvention to the public hospitals instead, in view\r\n\r\nof this economic downturn?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, running\r\n\r\nhospitals  efficiently and ensuring that all Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncan  afford their healthcare are two related but separate\r\n\r\nissues.   Hospitals  are  most efficiently  run  if  they\r\n\r\nfollow  cost  recovery principle,  that  all  aspects  of\r\n\r\nhealth  services are costed correctly and  resources  are\r\n\r\nallocated appropriately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As demand shifts due to advances in medicine, due to\r\n\r\nshifts   in   demography,  hospitals   reallocate   their\r\n\r\nresources  to meet these demands.  If you have  a  system\r\n\r\nthat does not respond to these changes continuously, then\r\n\r\nyou will find demand will build up, queues will form, and\r\n\r\npeople  have to wait long periods before they  get  their\r\n\r\nservices.  This is what happened in UK with the NHS.  The\r\n\r\nNHS  in  UK  does  not  follow  this  principle  of  cost\r\n\r\nrecovery.    And  as  a  result,  over  the  years,   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of services and facilities has suffered,  and\r\n\r\nnow  patients sometimes have to wait over a  year  before\r\n\r\nthey can get their surgery.  It has reached a crisis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlevel  that in the UK, they are sending patients down  to\r\n\r\nFrance,  Germany  and  neighbouring countries  for  their\r\n\r\ntreatment,  while  they  are  trying  to  upgrade   their\r\n\r\nservices.   If  we  do  not  follow  the  cost   recovery\r\n\r\nprinciple, we will be going down this road and, one  day,\r\n\r\nmay  end  up  having to send our patients to neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second issue of ensuring that all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can afford to pay for their medical care, we\r\n\r\nhave the safety net.  In 1996, the number of applications\r\n\r\nfor  Medifund  assistance was 55,859.  In  2001,  it  was\r\n\r\n157,190.   Despite  the almost three-fold  increase,  the\r\n\r\napproval  rate  was 99.7%, and 156,780 applications  were\r\n\r\napproved  in  2001.   A  total  of  $27.23  million   was\r\n\r\ndisbursed.  This is more than twice the amount  disbursed\r\n\r\nin 1996.  So, I think we need to separate the two issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, while I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  principle of  cost  recovery,  the  cost\r\n\r\nrecovered for the recent round of increase for B2  and  C\r\n\r\nclass  wards is only $12 million.  My question is,  given\r\n\r\nthe  prevailing  economic situation, can  the  Government\r\n\r\nnot, based on cost recovery, provide additional grants of\r\n\r\n$12  million  to  the hospitals?  Can the Government  not\r\n\r\nafford  that,  and thereby will avoid the  increases  and\r\n\r\nhelp Singaporeans to tide over the period?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we would like\r\n\r\nto  target our assistance to those who most need it.   By\r\n\r\ntargeting  our  assistance  through  Medifund,   we   are\r\n\r\ntargeting these additional funds to help those who cannot\r\n\r\nafford healthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Minister of State\r\n\r\nagree  that  it is not so much targeting those  who  need\r\n\r\nassistance?  The fact that the increases are concentrated\r\n\r\non  B2  and  C class wards, you are targeting  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  who  cannot afford.  So, you are targeting  those\r\n\r\npeople who cannot afford the increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> About 70% of Singaporeans use\r\n\r\nB2  and  C  class  wards.

Through Medifund,\r\n\r\nwhat  we  are doing is we are using that money to  target\r\n\r\nthose  people  who cannot afford to pay their  healthcare\r\n\r\nbills  with their Medisave, whose Medisave has  run  out,\r\n\r\nwho do not have the money to pay.  Whereas if you were to\r\n\r\ngive  the  money directly, then those who need the  money\r\n\r\nmost may not get it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Supplementary question, Sir.\r\n\r\nIs the Minister of State saying that ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, you have to catch my eye first,\r\n\r\nbefore you ask your question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sorry, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Michael Lim.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nwhile  we  agree  that in the long term, healthcare  cost\r\n\r\nwill continue to increase, I think what is needed is more\r\n\r\ntransparency  and  also clearer justification.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister of State to perhaps clarify some\r\n\r\nof   these  apparent  contradictions  in  the  healthcare\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, he had said that part of the cost\r\n\r\nincrease  was  due  to new drugs, and  yet  in  the  same\r\n\r\nbreath,  one of the clusters had said that there was  10-15%  decrease in the cost of drugs.  And we all know that\r\n\r\nfor  non-standard drugs, in other words, new  drugs  that\r\n\r\nare in the hospitals, usually they are hardly subsidised.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  sure  how  new drugs actually  result  in  an\r\n\r\nincrease in the cost of healthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, another contradiction is he said that\r\n\r\nthere  is financial counselling in hospitals.  But I  was\r\n\r\njust  given  a  very  good  incident  where  one  of  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders brought the mother to the hospital and\r\n\r\nwas  advised by the hospital doctor not to go to B2,  but\r\n\r\nto  go  and  see  the tua luo koon to  get  better  care,\r\n\r\nbecause  the suay luo koon could not give good care,  and\r\n\r\nwas  asked  to  go to a paying class.  So,  how  does  he\r\n\r\nensure that this seemingly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattempt  for  them  to provide financial  counselling  is\r\n\r\noperational at the ground level?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third contradiction is that while we build beautiful\r\n\r\nhospitals  and  we say that we have under-utilisation  of\r\n\r\nassets, that means it is very expensive to maintain these\r\n\r\nunder-utilised  assets, and that will actually  translate\r\n\r\nto  increased cost as well.  My question is: are we over-providing also for infrastructure as well?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least is that in this price increase,\r\n\r\nwhat  I could not understand is if the Ministry's concern\r\n\r\nwas  for  the  subsidised class, why did  they  not  make\r\n\r\nadjustments to the paying-class first?  Why do they  want\r\n\r\nto increase the cost for the subsidised class?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> On the first question on\r\n\r\nfinancial  advice  in  the hospitals,  we  have  made  it\r\n\r\nmandatory  that every patient receives such  counselling.\r\n\r\nIf  Dr  Michael  Lim  has  a  specific  case  where  such\r\n\r\ncounselling was not given to the patient, in  writing  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry, my Ministry will investigate the  hospital\r\n\r\nas  to  why such counselling was not given.  But we  have\r\n\r\nmade  it  mandatory and directed our hospitals that  they\r\n\r\nshould give such financial counselling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is about cost going up. Why do\r\n\r\ncosts  go up?  The single biggest factor for costs  going\r\n\r\nup is manpower cost, not drug cost.  Manpower cost in our\r\n\r\nhospitals amounts to $1.217 billion, or 56% of the  total\r\n\r\nhospital expenditure.  This cost has gone up because  the\r\n\r\nwages have gone up.  Wages of doctors went up between  4%\r\n\r\nand  5% in 2001, and for nurses it went up 5% to 8%.   In\r\n\r\norder  to  retain  staff,  the  hospitals  have  to   pay\r\n\r\ncompetitive  wages.   It is a global market  for  skilled\r\n\r\nmedical  and  nursing manpower.  In  nursing,  there  are\r\n\r\n126,000 vacant positions in the United States.  There are\r\n\r\n10,000  vacancies  in UK, and over 100,000  vacancies  in\r\n\r\nEurope.   There is also a shortage of medical consultants\r\n\r\nin  UK  and  they  are  trying to recruit  surgeons  from\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia.  In Australia, they are short of  doctors\r\n\r\nin rural hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these countries have made attempts to recruit\r\n\r\nstaff  from Singapore.  Some of the strategies that  they\r\n\r\nhave   used  are  distributing  brochures  in  hospitals,\r\n\r\nadvertising  in  local newspapers and  using  recruitment\r\n\r\nagencies.   Because of our competitive wages, the  impact\r\n\r\nof these foreign recruitment drives has been minimal.  If\r\n\r\nwe do not pay competitive wages and retain our staff, the\r\n\r\nquality of healthcare will drop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to price rises of paying-class patients,\r\n\r\nthe hospitals are free to raise their charges for paying-class patients.  And that is not a major concern for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health because patients have a choice between\r\n\r\nthe  private  hospitals and the private class  of  public\r\n\r\nhospitals, and the market can decide whether the price is\r\n\r\ntoo  high  or too low.  It is only where there are  price\r\n\r\nrises in C and B2 class wards that we monitor it, because\r\n\r\nthis impacts most Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of State\r\n\r\ndid not answer my first question earlier when I asked why\r\n\r\nis  it  that  the  Ministry of Health  cannot  give  more\r\n\r\nsubvention  to the public hospitals instead, in  view  of\r\n\r\nthis   economic   downturn.   I  have  two  supplementary\r\n\r\nquestions, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister of State whether his Ministry\r\n\r\nwould give more flexible consideration to the eligibility\r\n\r\ncriteria  for  Medifund applications to help Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho have difficulties in making ends meet, as a result of\r\n\r\nunemployment or less take-home pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask the Minister of State whether he\r\n\r\nwould  step  up public education on the use of  Medisave,\r\n\r\nMediShield  and  Medifund and on the  correct  choice  of\r\n\r\nhospital  wards.   Would he also publicise  the  detailed\r\n\r\ncharges   for   various  conditions  by   the   different\r\n\r\nhospitals, for example, on the web-site?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> With regard to the first\r\n\r\nquestion,  I have answered it.  It is more efficient  and\r\n\r\neffective  to help people who need assistance  in  paying\r\n\r\ntheir  healthcare  bills by targeting the  funds  through\r\n\r\nMedifund.  Because through\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMedifund, we are identifying those who do not have enough\r\n\r\nin  Medisave to pay for their healthcare.  Whereas if you\r\n\r\ngive  the same money directly to the hospitals, then  the\r\n\r\namount, or the proportion of that, which would go to  the\r\n\r\nmost  needy  would be much less.  So dollar  for  dollar,\r\n\r\nthis  is  a more effective way of helping those who  need\r\n\r\nhelp most.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Medifund, over the last eight years,\r\n\r\nMedifund  applications  that  have  been  approved   have\r\n\r\nincreased three-fold, and we are still approving Medifund\r\n\r\napplications at more than 99% rate.  We are  quite  happy\r\n\r\nto  open  the  Medifund  process for  inspection  by  our\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament.  At the press conference  earlier\r\n\r\nin September, the Minister had invited the press to visit\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals  to  ascertain  for  themselves  that  our\r\n\r\nMedifund process is transparent and is helping those  who\r\n\r\nneed the help.  And I am not sure how many members of the\r\n\r\npress  took up the invitation but, so far, the press  has\r\n\r\nnot reported on any case that has been unfairly rejected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the third issue on public education,\r\n\r\nwe  will  take up Dr Lily Neo's suggestion and distribute\r\n\r\nour  brochures  to  more people and  to  all  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  so  that they can distribute  them  to  their\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders and to their constituents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister of State, in\r\n\r\nhis  earlier  answer,  said that even  with  the  current\r\n\r\nincreases   in   charges  for  B2  and  C  class   wards,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should have sufficient Medisave to  pay  for\r\n\r\ntheir  medical  fees.

Just  a  follow-up  on  the  second\r\n\r\nquestion.

So if we enjoy a standard of healthcare that\r\n\r\nis  comparable to Australia and Europe, and  we  can  get\r\n\r\nthis  level of healthcare at 3% of our GDP, while  others\r\n\r\nare  paying  6%,  8% or 9% in Europe, it means  that  our\r\n\r\nsystem  is much more efficient than the system in Europe.\r\n\r\nAnd that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  what we mean by 3% of our GDP.

The reason we are able\r\n\r\nto  do  this is because we run our hospitals  on  a  cost\r\n\r\nrecovery  system.

The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Gamma Knife Centre is another example  whereby\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  machine that is used by  both  private  and\r\n\r\npublic sector doctors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the clusters has led to competition\r\n\r\nbetween  the  hospitals in the two groups.   One  of  the\r\n\r\neffects of this competition has been increased efficiency\r\n\r\nby both clusters.  This also allows us in the Ministry to\r\n\r\ncompare  the  hospitals across the clusters  and  see  if\r\n\r\nthere  are  any inefficiencies that need to be  corrected\r\n\r\nand  any  systems that are extremely efficient  that  the\r\n\r\nother  can  copy.  We also believe that if you  can  move\r\n\r\ninpatient  surgery  to  day  surgery,  you  can   provide\r\n\r\nhealthcare  more  effectively and  efficiently.   So  the\r\n\r\nhospitals  have increased their day surgery capacity  and\r\n\r\nare  encouraging  day  surgery.  On  our  part,  we  have\r\n\r\nallowed  Medisave, which is meant for inpatient care,  to\r\n\r\nbe used for day surgery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, if a patient can be looked after at\r\n\r\nhome through home nursing, rather than being looked after\r\n\r\nin  the hospital, that is a more efficient way of looking\r\n\r\nafter  the person.  So we have relaxed our Medisave rules\r\n\r\non payment for home nursing.  The trend will be, over the\r\n\r\nnext  five years, more and more surgeries will be  moving\r\n\r\nfrom   inpatient  to  day  surgery  and  more  and   more\r\n\r\ntreatments,  like  chemotherapy which  used  to  be  done\r\n\r\ninpatient,  will  become outpatient  treatment.   In  the\r\n\r\nrecent  relaxation of Medisave, we have allowed  Medisave\r\n\r\nto  be used for IV antibiotics because, in the past,  the\r\n\r\npatient stayed in the hospital for maybe three weeks  for\r\n\r\nthe IV antibiotics.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNow,  they can go home with the drip connected  to  their\r\n\r\nhand  and  they come in as an outpatient and get  the  IV\r\n\r\nantibiotics.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, two supplementary questions.   Firstly,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister of State whether he would\r\n\r\nassure  the  House  that  the cost  of  over-capacity  of\r\n\r\nhospitals  is not passed on to patients, and  if  it  is,\r\n\r\nwould the Ministry consider subsidising the cost of  this\r\n\r\nadditional capacity.  The second question is with  regard\r\n\r\nto  Medifund.  The Minister of State has repeatedly  said\r\n\r\nthat  Medifund has been used to help subsidise the  lower\r\n\r\nincome group.  Indeed, that is a good sign.  However,  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the  high utilisation of the  fund,  would  the\r\n\r\nMinister consider increasing the amount available for the\r\n\r\nfund  and relaxing the criteria so that more can  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> With regard to Medifund, more\r\n\r\nthan  99.7%  of the applications have been approved  even\r\n\r\nthough the number of applications has gone up from 55,000\r\n\r\nto  157,000-plus.  So we are assisting many  more  people\r\n\r\ntoday than we were six years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to any over-capacity that the hospitals\r\n\r\nhave,  we  will work with the hospitals to  see  whether,\r\n\r\nwherever possible, they can let others make use  of  that\r\n\r\nover-capacity so that their running cost would be down.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> May I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister of State how would the Ministry of Health ensure\r\n\r\nthat there will be greater transparency in the healthcare\r\n\r\nand  hospital charges and adjustments so as to  keep  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public  better informed?

What we are doing is ensuring  that\r\n\r\nour healthcare system continues to run as efficiently  as\r\n\r\npossible  in  providing its services effectively  to  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean  public.  We recognise the difficulties  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans may face in paying their hospital bills  and\r\n\r\nwe  have, as a result, increased the amount of money that\r\n\r\nwe  are  giving out through Medifund to help people  meet\r\n\r\nthat difficulty.

Member\r\n\r\nhas, she can send these innovative ideas on management to\r\n\r\nthe   hospital   management  and   they   will   consider\r\n\r\nintroducing  them  in the hospital, if  these  innovative\r\n\r\nideas are workable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister of State has said that a large part of the  cost\r\n\r\nis mainly manpower\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncost.   But, as a doctor, he is also aware that,  really,\r\n\r\nthe  cost  increases as the consumption of  services  and\r\n\r\ndrugs increases.  This definitely has an impact, more  so\r\n\r\nthan  the  manpower cost itself.  Is there  in  fact  any\r\n\r\nsystem  to  ensure  that there is no over-consumption  of\r\n\r\nservices or drugs?  I am not aware of any system at  this\r\n\r\npoint in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when the Ministry looks at subsidies for\r\n\r\nthe  patients,  I wonder whether depreciation  costs  are\r\n\r\nconsidered, because if they factor in depreciation  costs\r\n\r\nfor  the  hospitals, then actually the  man-in-the-street\r\n\r\nhas  to  help fund expensive hospitals as well when  they\r\n\r\npay their part of the share of hospital charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, while the clusters increase competition,\r\n\r\ndoes  it not also cause duplication?  For example,  I  am\r\n\r\naware  that,  in  the  past, we used  to  centralise  the\r\n\r\nservices,  eg,  National Skin Centre.   Now,  with  these\r\n\r\nclusters,  many  hospitals also want to  set  up  similar\r\n\r\nservices  and  they are in fact dangling carrots  to  the\r\n\r\nconsultants  in  the  National Skin Centre  to  duplicate\r\n\r\nthese  services in other hospitals.  While it is  claimed\r\n\r\nthat  there is competition and, therefore, better use  of\r\n\r\nresources, it seems that, on the ground, it is otherwise.\r\n\r\nThere  is  duplication  of resources.   This  means  more\r\n\r\nequipment, more services.  So how does all this add up to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  being  on  top  of  this  cost-containment\r\n\r\nexercise?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, similar to what one hon. Member\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned,  the  Ministry  has  also  put  in  other\r\n\r\nadministrative measures, eg, casemix, which, we know cost\r\n\r\nquite  significantly in terms of software,  hardware  and\r\n\r\nmanpower costs.  But I do not think casemix results in  a\r\n\r\nhigher subvention in the total sum for the hospitals.  It\r\n\r\nonly  adds to the cost.  So maybe the Minister  of  State\r\n\r\ncan  enlighten  us as to how the Ministry translates  all\r\n\r\nthese  very good policies into real cost-saving  measures\r\n\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> First of all, the cost of the\r\n\r\nhospital  is  not included in the cost recovery  for  the\r\n\r\nhospital.   So the depreciation of the hospital  building\r\n\r\nis not one of the costs included.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to demand for health services, if we\r\n\r\nlook  across the world, as a country gets more  affluent,\r\n\r\nthe  demand  for  health  services  increases.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause the people have more disposable income, a  larger\r\n\r\nproportion  of which they are willing to pay  for  health\r\n\r\nservices.   Take the United States, for example.   14.99%\r\n\r\nof  their  GDP is spent on healthcare services,  and  the\r\n\r\nmore affluent states, eg, California, spend almost 20% of\r\n\r\ntheir  state GDP on healthcare.  So, as Singapore becomes\r\n\r\nmore  affluent, a larger proportion of disposable  income\r\n\r\nmay  be  spent  on  healthcare expenditure.   To  try  to\r\n\r\ncurtail  this,  we  need to make people  responsible  for\r\n\r\ntheir  healthcare  expenditure, because  then  they  will\r\n\r\ndecide  how  much of their dollar they want to  spend  on\r\n\r\nhealthcare  and  how  much of it to spend  on  education.\r\n\r\nWhere  healthcare is provided free, there  is  usually  a\r\n\r\nbuffet-syndrome and there is no control over  the  demand\r\n\r\nfor  healthcare  services.  But  because  in  our  system\r\n\r\npeople  are  paying for their healthcare with  their  own\r\n\r\nmoney  -  Medisave is, in effect, money  that  they  have\r\n\r\nsaved  -  Singaporeans  have  been  very  sensible.   And\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are not over-spending on healthcare.   That\r\n\r\nis  why  we have managed to have a very high standard  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare, equivalent to Australia and Europe,  and  yet\r\n\r\nour  total  healthcare spending is only 3%  of  our  GDP,\r\n\r\nwhile in Europe and Australia, it is between 6-9%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister of State when Singaporeans could expect the next\r\n\r\nround  of  regular  and  small increases  in  health-care\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Our hospitals review their\r\n\r\ncosts  every year.

The unit  was  tasked  to\r\n\r\norganise   religious  classes  and,  subsequently,   also\r\n\r\nchildren's   camps.   These  activities  were,   however,\r\n\r\nstopped  after  1998 when the Jemaah Islamiyah  began  to\r\n\r\nnarrow its focus towards preparing the adult members  for\r\n\r\noperational functions.  This is when the training for the\r\n\r\nJemaah  Islamiyah  members  in  Malaysia  also  began  to\r\n\r\ninclude an increasingly more military-type curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jemaah Islamiyah's religious classes and camps\r\n\r\nwere  not conducted under the banner of Jemaah Islamiyah.\r\n\r\nThey  were open to all and not confined only to  children\r\n\r\nof  Jemaah  Islamiyah  parents.  The  camps,  which  were\r\n\r\ncalled  \"Tamrin  Kanak Kanak\", which means  Training  for\r\n\r\nChildren, began in 1995/96, and participation was  sought\r\n\r\nthrough advertisements in the Berita Harian and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  word  of  mouth.

The religious classes for  children\r\n\r\ncentred on Quran reading, and the activities of the  camp\r\n\r\nincluded  the usual youth adventure learning  activities,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  abseiling, \"flying fox\", swimming, archery  and\r\n\r\nphysical exercises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internal Security Department is aware of some of\r\n\r\nthose who attended these religious classes and camps, but\r\n\r\nnot all.

The  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Department's investigations have discovered that\r\n\r\nin  one  camping trip, Jemaah Islamiyah fiah ayub,  which\r\n\r\nmeans  cell leader, Khalim bin Jaffar, used the bus  ride\r\n\r\nconveying the camp participants to an activity site as  a\r\n\r\ncover to video the Sembawang Road and Pakistan Road areas\r\n\r\nwhere they believe American servicemen and their families\r\n\r\nstay.

Let me\r\n\r\nexplain,  Sir.   Despite the progress  we  have  achieved\r\n\r\nsince  independence, gaps continue to exist  between  man\r\n\r\nand  woman  on  the  economic front.  The  percentage  of\r\n\r\neconomically  active  women in the workforce  is  54%  in\r\n\r\n2001.   This is significantly lower than that for men  of\r\n\r\n78% in the same year.  As a group, women workers' average\r\n\r\nsalaries  were  lower  than male workers.   This  is  not\r\n\r\nreally because we have unequal pay for the same job,  but\r\n\r\nrather  because women are generally still working in  the\r\n\r\nlower-paid professions.  These are realities.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  economic reality of the situation is such  that  the\r\n\r\nlaw  must  continue to provide protection for  women  and\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, the hon.

These include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the financial needs of the wife;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) her income or earning capacity, property and\r\n\r\nother financial resources;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) any physical or mental disability of the wife;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the age of each party to the marriage and the\r\n\r\nduration of the marriage;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) the contributions made by each of the parties\r\n\r\nto  the  marriage  and  to  the welfare  of  the  family,\r\n\r\nincluding any contribution made by looking after the home\r\n\r\nor caring for the family;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) the standard of living enjoyed by the wife\r\n\r\nbefore  the  husband  neglected  or  refused  to  provide\r\n\r\nreasonable maintenance; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) the conduct of each of the parties to the\r\n\r\nmarriage,  if  the conduct is such that it would  in  the\r\n\r\nopinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law currently provides for the Courts to make\r\n\r\na  fair  and  equitable judgement when making maintenance\r\n\r\norders,  we feel that there is no necessity for  a  means\r\n\r\ntest  as suggested by the hon. Member.   For this reason,\r\n\r\nthe   Courts   do  not  always  grant  applications   for\r\n\r\nmaintenance,  and have indeed dismissed  some,  while  in\r\n\r\nother  cases,  have granted a lesser sum for  maintenance\r\n\r\nthan what was asked for.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  the  Minister of State aware that  the  present\r\n\r\nreality  is that there are approximately 1,800 households\r\n\r\nin  Singapore where the husband or the man is  the  full-time home-maker?

In fact, the family  also\r\n\r\nincludes  children.   This matter was actually  discussed\r\n\r\nsome  years ago.  The decision at that time was  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  not worthwhile to complicate the Women's Charter  by\r\n\r\namending  it  into a Family Charter because  the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter was working well and it is still working well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Is the Minister of State aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  current Women's Charter already  includes  the\r\n\r\nprotection  of  children?

The Women's Charter's\r\n\r\nobjective is to basically protect the women and  children\r\n\r\nin  the case of matrimony.  This particular objective  is\r\n\r\nstill  valid  because, as I have mentioned  earlier,  the\r\n\r\nsocio-economic reality today is that the  men  are  still\r\n\r\nstronger than the women and children.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your kind\r\n\r\nindulgence,  just one more supplementary question.

In our society, if a man is healthy with  no\r\n\r\nphysical  disability, to say that  he  has  got  problems\r\n\r\nlooking for a job and therefore needs a whole Charter  to\r\n\r\nprotect him, it would appear a little bit excessive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chong, you promised me that was the\r\n\r\nlast one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Yes, Sir, but the Minister of\r\n\r\nState's  response really leaves me with no  choice.

This\r\n\r\nProgramme was launched in December 2001.  It was a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprogramme to help the unemployed cope with job  loss  and\r\n\r\nencourage  them to participate in skills upgrading.   For\r\n\r\nthe  general  information of the House,  this  is  not  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  that specifically deals with skill sets.   The\r\n\r\ntraining   is  more  general.   To  give  you  a   better\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of the programme, it deals  with  managing\r\n\r\ntheir emotions when they are retrenched, financial impact\r\n\r\nplanning,  managing expectations, job search and  writing\r\n\r\nand  interviewing skills.  These are some of  the  things\r\n\r\nwhich  we  teach.  It aims to teach workers how  to  plan\r\n\r\ntheir  next  career  move, search  for  jobs  and  secure\r\n\r\nemployment quicker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception, about 16,000 workers have been\r\n\r\ntrained.   Close to 83% or nearly 13,000 were  unemployed\r\n\r\nwhen they signed up for the course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the participants were above 60 years\r\n\r\nold.   In fact, 60% of them were above 35 years old.   In\r\n\r\nequivalent proportion, 60% had secondary, NTC-2 or  lower\r\n\r\nqualifications.  In  other words, 40% had  post-secondary\r\n\r\nqualifications, either in Diploma, ITE or  Degrees.   The\r\n\r\nmix  of  trainees  that  I  have just  recounted  broadly\r\n\r\nreflects the current educational workforce profile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned, the WorkSkills Training\r\n\r\nProgrammme does not directly place the participants in  a\r\n\r\njob.   However, participants are referred to the  various\r\n\r\njob-placement  agencies to facilitate  their  job  search\r\n\r\nafter this course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the programme is not specifically\r\n\r\ndirected at job placement, my Ministry was interested  to\r\n\r\nknow  how effective this was in helping trainees who  had\r\n\r\nattended the programme.  We are in the midst of the study\r\n\r\nwhich is expected to end in October.  But I can give some\r\n\r\npreliminary results.  The results showed that 43% of  the\r\n\r\nsampled trainees managed to secure employment after going\r\n\r\nthrough  the  programme.   We would  like  to  take  some\r\n\r\ncredit,  but  since  it was not a specific  programme,  I\r\n\r\ncannot quite prove the cause and effect.

The  1995\r\n\r\nNUS  Study on Mental Health estimates that about  10%  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  aged 21 to 55 years old have some  form  of\r\n\r\nmental  ill health.  Of this figure, about 5%  have  mild\r\n\r\ndisorders,  while  5% have moderate to severe  disorders.\r\n\r\nMajor  mental  disorders  are relatively  uncommon.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the prevalence of schizophrenia in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nestimated  to  be about 0.75%, comparable  to  world-wide\r\n\r\nfigures  which  are in the region of  0.5%  to  1%.   The\r\n\r\nprevalence  of  certain common mental disorders  will  be\r\n\r\nupdated when IMH and NUS conduct a National Mental Health\r\n\r\nSurvey later this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised his concern that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  wish to seek help for mental illness may not  do  so\r\n\r\nbecause of the increase in charges at IMH.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  highlight that the fee charges for IMH are still very\r\n\r\naffordable, even after the fee revisions.  For  inpatient\r\n\r\ncare,  the average C Class bill size per day is only  $13\r\n\r\nwhile  the  average B2 Class bill size per  day  is  $30.\r\n\r\nThis works out to an average increase of only $1 for a  C\r\n\r\nClass  bill and $4 for a B2 Class bill, which is minimal.\r\n\r\nPatients can also use Medisave and MediShield to pay  for\r\n\r\nthese  charges.  For outpatient consultation, the average\r\n\r\nbill  size after the fee revision is $25, an increase  of\r\n\r\nonly  $2.   Therefore, the increase in  fees  should  not\r\n\r\ndeter   Singaporeans  from  seeking   help   for   mental\r\n\r\nconditions if they need to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, should patients be unable to afford the\r\n\r\nhighly  subsidised  bills  even  after  they  have   used\r\n\r\nMedisave  and MediShield, Medifund is available  to  help\r\n\r\nthem.

I will  provide  an\r\n\r\nupdate today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore companies have invested in close to 10,000\r\n\r\nprojects  in China, amounting to about US$20  billion  to\r\n\r\ndate.   China has now become Singapore's largest overseas\r\n\r\ninvestment destination, overtaking Malaysia since 1997 in\r\n\r\ncumulative  terms.  Our businessmen have been positioning\r\n\r\nthemselves to take advantage of the many opportunities in\r\n\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them have done well. For example, Khong\r\n\r\nGuan  sold  300 million RMB (S$67 million) worth  of  its\r\n\r\nproducts in China last year.  Education services provider\r\n\r\nTMC  has attracted 1,000 full-time students in its  Xi'an\r\n\r\ncampus  alone,  thanks to its modern facilities  and  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  its courses.  Smart Garments has grown  from\r\n\r\n280 workers in 1985 to 2,600 workers in its three Chinese\r\n\r\nfactories today, producing 1.75 million suits a year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides investing in China, our companies have also\r\n\r\nbegun  to  partner with Chinese companies  that  are  now\r\n\r\nseeking  to internationalise in exploring other  markets.\r\n\r\nFor  example, one of our local companies has successfully\r\n\r\npartnered Zhejiang-based Feiyue Sewing Machine  Group  to\r\n\r\nenter the India market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are steadily building up our China network.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill amends the International Arbitration Act\r\n\r\nto  make  it  clear  that parties to  an  arbitration  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  free  to adopt the arbitration  rules  of\r\n\r\ntheir  choice to govern their arbitration, and that their\r\n\r\nchoice   of  arbitration  rules  will  be  respected   by\r\n\r\nSingapore  law and be given the fullest effect  possible.\r\n\r\nExamples  of  arbitration rules are the  UNCITRAL  Rules,\r\n\r\nSIAC Rules, ICC Rules and LCIA Rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill's clarification will reaffirm Singapore's\r\n\r\nposition  as an attractive venue for arbitration  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.  It also reaffirms Government's intention  to  do\r\n\r\nwhatever is necessary to create conducive conditions  for\r\n\r\nthe conduct of international arbitrations in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Arbitration Act was passed in 1995\r\n\r\nto   adopt   the  UNCITRAL  Model  Law  on  International\r\n\r\nCommercial  Arbitration as part of  Singapore's  domestic\r\n\r\nlaw.   The UNCITRAL Model Law is not a set of arbitration\r\n\r\nrules.   It  is intended to be the applicable arbitration\r\n\r\nlaw or, in lawyers' parlance - the curial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlaw  or  lex  arbitri.   Like all arbitration  laws,  the\r\n\r\nUNCITRAL  Model Law does not contain a comprehensive  set\r\n\r\nof   procedural  rules,  but  merely  sets  out  a  basic\r\n\r\nprocedural  framework.  The expectation is  that  parties\r\n\r\nwill  supplement  this  basic procedural  framework  with\r\n\r\narbitration rules of their choice.  Parties are also free\r\n\r\nto  choose  their  own alternative arrangements  in  most\r\n\r\nprocedural  matters.  Indeed, one of the key  pillars  of\r\n\r\nthe  UNCITRAL  Model  Law  is  the  protection  of  party\r\n\r\nautonomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, parties to a Singapore arbitration\r\n\r\nare  free to adopt whatever set of arbitration rules they\r\n\r\nwish.   The  Model Law is specifically drafted to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat   parties'  wishes  are  given  the  fullest  effect\r\n\r\npossible.   Sir,  this has been the legal position  since\r\n\r\nthis House adopted the Model Law as part of Singapore law\r\n\r\nin  1995,  and has always remained so.  And this  is  how\r\n\r\nboth  the international and local arbitration communities\r\n\r\nhave always understood the legal position to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some uncertainty has arisen as a result of\r\n\r\na  Singapore  High  Court  case, Dermajaya  Properties  v\r\n\r\nPremium Properties, which was decided earlier this  year.\r\n\r\nThe  correctness of the actual decision in this  case  is\r\n\r\nnot in dispute.  What has caused concern in some quarters\r\n\r\nwas  a  comment  made  by  the judge  in  the  course  of\r\n\r\ndelivering  his judgment.  He commented that, if  parties\r\n\r\nadopt   a   set  of  arbitration  rules  which   contains\r\n\r\nprocedures which are different from those contemplated by\r\n\r\nthe  Model  Law,  then those arbitration rules  would  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as  incompatible with the Model Law  and  would\r\n\r\ntherefore   be  entirely  excluded.   This  comment   was\r\n\r\nstrictly not necessary in arriving at the actual decision\r\n\r\nin  the  case, and therefore did not have the  effect  of\r\n\r\nchanging  the  law  on the applicability  of  arbitration\r\n\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, my Ministry has received feedback that\r\n\r\nlawyers in some international law firms had advised their\r\n\r\nclients  that,  as  a result of the Dermajaya  case,  the\r\n\r\nlegal   position  in  Singapore  is  now  uncertain.    I\r\n\r\nunderstand that some of these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlawyers   have  also  advised  their  clients  to   avoid\r\n\r\nSingapore as a venue for arbitration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided to set out the\r\n\r\nlegal position in no uncertain terms.  The Bill does this\r\n\r\nby   adding  a  new  section  15A  to  the  International\r\n\r\nArbitration Act.  The first subsection of the new section\r\n\r\n15A   declares,   for  the  avoidance  of   doubt,   that\r\n\r\narbitration rules adopted by parties shall apply and must\r\n\r\nbe   given  effect  to  the  extent  that  they  are  not\r\n\r\ninconsistent with a mandatory provision of the Act or the\r\n\r\nModel Law.  A mandatory provision is one whereby the  Act\r\n\r\nor Model Law does not permit the parties to derogate from\r\n\r\nor  vary.   This  therefore reinforces the  principle  of\r\n\r\nparty  autonomy, and makes it clear beyond doubt that  no\r\n\r\nset  of  arbitration rules ought ever to be  regarded  as\r\n\r\nincompatible with the Act or the Model Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining subsections seek to flesh out the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  inconsistency, by referring to a  number  of\r\n\r\nscenarios  where there could be doubts as to whether  any\r\n\r\ninconsistency  exists.  For example, it is  clarified  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  that there is no inconsistency  if  the  rules\r\n\r\nprovide  for something on which the Act or the Model  Law\r\n\r\nis  silent  or  if the Act or the Model Law provides  for\r\n\r\nsomething on which the rules are silent.  There  is  also\r\n\r\nno inconsistency if the rules provide for something which\r\n\r\nis  already covered by a non-mandatory provision  of  the\r\n\r\nAct or the Model Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, the general approach is that\r\n\r\narbitration  rules adopted by the parties will  be  given\r\n\r\nfull  effect.   Where  there is a  conflict  between  the\r\n\r\narbitration rules and the Act or the Model Law, the rules\r\n\r\nwill  prevail  unless the conflict is  with  a  mandatory\r\n\r\nprovision of the Act or the Model Law.  Hence, in effect,\r\n\r\nwith  this  narrow  exception,  parties  to  a  Singapore\r\n\r\narbitration   will  have  the  full  freedom   to   adopt\r\n\r\narbitration rules of their choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis   is  another  move  which  will  further  establish\r\n\r\nSingapore's position as one of the most conducive  places\r\n\r\nfor  international  arbitration  in  the  region.   Other\r\n\r\nmeasures  we  have  already introduced  include  allowing\r\n\r\nforeign  counsel to participate in arbitrations conducted\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  streamlining immigration  procedures  for\r\n\r\nforeign  arbitrators and abolishing withholding  tax  for\r\n\r\nforeign  arbitrators.  Recently, the SIAC announced  that\r\n\r\nit  would lower the fees charged for its services, expand\r\n\r\nits  panel  of arbitrators and extend the scope  of  SIAC\r\n\r\narbitrations.  In short, Sir, we will do more to  promote\r\n\r\nSingapore   as   a  preferred  venue  for   international\r\n\r\narbitrations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Assoc.

The  PM\r\n\r\nasked,  and  I  quote, \"Will Singaporeans  be  rooted  to\r\n\r\nSingapore?  Will enough Singaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstay  here, to ensure our country's long term survival?\".\r\n\r\nHe  was  concerned  about fair weather  Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nwould  run  away  whenever the country runs  into  stormy\r\n\r\nweather.  He called them quitters.  The speech sparked  a\r\n\r\nseries  of spirited debate over the issue of stayers  and\r\n\r\nquitters  in  the  media and among many Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\ncared about the issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans resented the labels of stayers and\r\n\r\nquitters.   They were quick to offer reasons  for  people\r\n\r\nwanting  to leave the country.  They rigorously  defended\r\n\r\ntheir decision to move out.  Some even went to the extent\r\n\r\nof  stating  their intention to leave but  complained  of\r\n\r\ntheir inability to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there were also Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nwere  passionate  about  the country  and  pledged  their\r\n\r\nloyalty   and  commitment  publicly.   There  were   even\r\n\r\nforeigners  who  felt  strongly enough  to  join  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from the public reaction to PM's speech, the\r\n\r\nissue  of stayers and quitters is close to the hearts  of\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans, if not all Singaporeans.  The PM  has\r\n\r\nclearly achieved his intention \"to jolt Singaporeans into\r\n\r\nthinking about the issue\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we endeavour to re-position our economy and\r\n\r\nremake Singapore, we cannot lose sight of the fundamental\r\n\r\nissue  of Singaporeans' identity and commitment.   As  we\r\n\r\nstrive to create a new Singapore, we must be certain that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do want this new Singapore and are committed\r\n\r\nenough  to  be  willing  to make personal  sacrifices  to\r\n\r\ndefend our ideals and to realise our dreams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the gravity of this issue, I felt that it\r\n\r\nshould  rightfully  be debated in Parliament,  being  the\r\n\r\nhighest  governing  authority in  the  country.   We,  as\r\n\r\nleaders,  must  make  a  stand  and  lead  the   way   to\r\n\r\nstrengthening  our  commitment  to  the  shared   vision.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   after   discussing  with   a   few   of   my\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleagues, we decided to table a motion on\r\n\r\nstayers and quitters at this sitting.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Objective</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By moving the motion, we hope to provide a formal\r\n\r\nand  official  forum where this issue can  be  thoroughly\r\n\r\ndebated.  Both the backbench and the frontbench will have\r\n\r\nan  opportunity to express their views on  this  subject.\r\n\r\nWe  hope  that, by doing so, we can identify and  clarify\r\n\r\nthe  real issues that are confronting us today.   We  can\r\n\r\nthen begin to examine our policies and programmes from  a\r\n\r\nbalanced perspective to see if there are weaknesses  that\r\n\r\nneed   to  be  addressed  in  order  to  help  strengthen\r\n\r\nSingaporeans'  sense of belonging and commitment  to  the\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transparent process of parliamentary debate will\r\n\r\nalso  create greater awareness among Singaporeans of  the\r\n\r\nissue of stayers and quitters and will undoubtedly send a\r\n\r\nstrong  signal to them on what it would take  for  us  to\r\n\r\nmeet the challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Motion Defined</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to explain the motion.\r\n\r\nFirst,  let  me  say what it is not.  The motion  is  not\r\n\r\nabout  identifying who are the stayers  or  who  are  the\r\n\r\nquitters.   The  labelling does nothing productive.   The\r\n\r\nfocus  of the motion is to debate on the possible  causes\r\n\r\nof  people wanting to quit Singapore and what we need  to\r\n\r\ndo to make them stay.  What do Singaporeans want?  Can we\r\n\r\ngive  them what they want without compromising collective\r\n\r\nnational  interests?  What do we need to  do  to  achieve\r\n\r\nthat?   I am not naive enough to believe that we can  all\r\n\r\nagree on the same answers to these questions.  But if  we\r\n\r\ncan find some common ground to start working on, we would\r\n\r\nhave made good progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what is the issue then? I think the key issue\r\n\r\nfacing   us  today  is  not  about  Singaporeans  leaving\r\n\r\nSingapore,  not  about them going  overseas,  be  it  for\r\n\r\nstudies or for work.  Singapore is fast becoming a global\r\n\r\ncity.   It is inevitable that more and more Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially   the   younger   generation,   or   the    3G\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, will be going overseas to work.   This,  in\r\n\r\nitself,  is  not  a bad thing.  The Government  has  been\r\n\r\nencouraging our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies to go global.  To do so, we must be prepared to\r\n\r\nsend  our managers and workers overseas.  In fact,  given\r\n\r\nthat overseas operations are often more complex than  the\r\n\r\nhome  ground, we usually end up sending out the  best  of\r\n\r\nthe   breed.   Going  overseas  to  work  does  not  make\r\n\r\nSingaporeans quitters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many of our forefathers came from China,\r\n\r\nIndia,  and other countries.  They came here  to  make  a\r\n\r\nliving  and  most of them did not even have a  chance  to\r\n\r\nreturn  to  their motherland.  However, I have  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  deep  down in their hearts, many of them felt  that\r\n\r\nthey  were more Chinese or Indians than Singaporeans even\r\n\r\ntill their death.  It took us more than one generation to\r\n\r\nchange  this  migrant mentality.  Surely, our forefathers\r\n\r\nwere   no  quitters  when  they  left  their  motherland.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  many Japanese have worked overseas  for  many\r\n\r\nyears  as their industrialisation programme took them  to\r\n\r\nwhere  the  markets  were.   They  are  still  very  much\r\n\r\nJapanese in their hearts and they all look forward to the\r\n\r\nday   they  can  return  to  Japan,  although  they  will\r\n\r\ninvariably  find  great difficulties in adapting  to  the\r\n\r\nlifestyle at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real issue, Sir, is an affair of the heart. It\r\n\r\nis about our emotional linkage to Singapore.  It is about\r\n\r\nour  sense of belonging, our sense of ownership  and  our\r\n\r\nsense  of  responsibility to the country.  Regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhere  we are physically, will we stand up and be counted\r\n\r\nwhen   Singapore  needs  us?   Are  we  willing  to  make\r\n\r\nsacrifices  for  the interests of fellow Singaporeans  or\r\n\r\nwould  we  give up instead at the first sign of  trouble?\r\n\r\nDo  we take Singapore as our home, or do we treat it like\r\n\r\na hotel?  That is the question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that many Singaporeans are committed to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   However  difficult the situation  may  seem,\r\n\r\nthey  will  stay  and  fight.  The  introduction  of  the\r\n\r\nNEWater  in  response to the threat by  Malaysia  on  our\r\n\r\nwater  supplies is a good example of the \"never say  die\"\r\n\r\nspirit.   For this, I must applaud the Minister  for  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment for his efforts.  However, I think we cannot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntake this commitment for granted.  While there may not be\r\n\r\na  major  problem today, we need to be conscious  of  the\r\n\r\nissue  and  continuously work at it to  prevent  it  from\r\n\r\nbecoming  a major problem.  As our economic restructuring\r\n\r\nand  remaking of Singapore pick up momentum, the need  to\r\n\r\naddress Singaporeans' commitment to the country has  also\r\n\r\nbecome increasingly urgent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Issue</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the last 30 years, we have\r\n\r\nbuilt  ourselves a world-class infrastructure.   We  have\r\n\r\none  of  the world's best airport and sea port.  We  have\r\n\r\none of the most efficient transport and telecommunication\r\n\r\nsystem.   We have the best hardware.  We have also  built\r\n\r\nourselves a world-class workforce.  Our productivity  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the main attraction to foreign investors.  We  have\r\n\r\nthe  best software.  Now, we must also build ourselves  a\r\n\r\nworld-class citizen, what I call the HEARTware.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to understand what are the issues at the\r\n\r\nhearts  of Singaporeans.  What cause them to think  about\r\n\r\nquitting?   I  think  there are three  main  issues  that\r\n\r\nconcern most Singaporeans who are sitting on the fence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, they feel that Singapore's lifestyle is too\r\n\r\nstressful.   Their  children face  a  lot  of  stress  in\r\n\r\nschools.   They themselves face a lot of stress at  work.\r\n\r\nThis stress is then brought home and they face stress  in\r\n\r\ntheir  family relationship which may eventually  lead  to\r\n\r\nthe  breaking up of their family.  They believe  that  by\r\n\r\nquitting  Singapore,  they may be able  to  find  a  less\r\n\r\nstressful   lifestyle   in   another   country,   another\r\n\r\nenvironment,  and  they will be happier,  their  children\r\n\r\nwill  be happier and they can keep their family together.\r\n\r\nWhether  they  are right or wrong is not the  issue  here\r\n\r\nbecause  they may never be able to find out  whether  the\r\n\r\npasture  is indeed greener over the other side.  What  is\r\n\r\nimportant is their perception.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, stress is inevitable. In fact, I would say\r\n\r\nstress  is sometimes healthy, if given the right  dosage.\r\n\r\nSingapore is a unique\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountry   with  no  natural  resources  and  no   natural\r\n\r\nadvantage.  It was a miracle that we could get as far  as\r\n\r\nwe  did.  We need to continue to strive to stay ahead  of\r\n\r\nour competitors.  Therein lies the origin of stress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, perhaps we could examine whether the level\r\n\r\nof stress has exceeded the safe dosage.  Are Singaporeans\r\n\r\nsuffering  from an overdose of stress?  We can also  look\r\n\r\ninto  how  we  can  help Singaporeans  better  cope  with\r\n\r\nstress.  Can we put in some relief valves?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some Singaporeans think that there are\r\n\r\ngreater  opportunities  elsewhere  where  they  can  make\r\n\r\nbetter  progress  than  the  competitive  environment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  can offer them.  Instead of being a technician\r\n\r\nhere,  he can be an engineer in another country.  Instead\r\n\r\nof  being a worker, he can be a manager.  As we bring  in\r\n\r\nforeign  talents,  Singaporeans also can  become  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents to other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is Singapore will always remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  given  our unique situation.   The  key  is\r\n\r\nwhether we can offer equally attractive opportunities  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  The question is whether we can offer  them\r\n\r\nmore  than economic opportunities.  Can we convince  them\r\n\r\nto look beyond personal career achievements?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, many Singaporeans complain about the rising\r\n\r\ncost of living here.  They accept that this is the result\r\n\r\nof  providing a higher standard of living.  However, they\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the  higher  standard  of  living  does   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily translate into better quality of life.   They\r\n\r\nmay  have three golf clubs, but they do not have time  to\r\n\r\nplay  golf.  They may have a big bungalow, but  they  are\r\n\r\nhardly at home.  They hope that in a different world, the\r\n\r\ncost  of living may be lower and they can afford to  have\r\n\r\nlower  income.  Even if the standard of living is  lower,\r\n\r\nat  least  they  may  have  more  quality  time  for  the\r\n\r\nchildren, the family and themselves.  Their intention may\r\n\r\nbe quite noble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While cost increases may not be avoidable, we may be\r\n\r\nable  to  manage  the process better and to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nbetter\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstandard of living does translate into better quality  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Approach</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to address these issues, we need to focus on\r\n\r\nthree aspects, and I would summarise it with three  Cs  - Committed, Connected and Concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Committed people. We need to get\r\n\r\nSingaporeans committed to our cause.  We need them to  be\r\n\r\ncommitted not only to themselves, but to their family, to\r\n\r\ntheir  community  and  to their country.   Commitment  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  goes beyond the property and assets that  they\r\n\r\nhave.   Many Singaporeans have houses in other countries,\r\n\r\nAustralia,  Canada, UK and more recently,  China.   House\r\n\r\nownership is no longer the key to commitment.  We need to\r\n\r\ncreate  in  them  a sense of ownership not  just  of  the\r\n\r\nhouse, but of the nation.  Then they will have a sense of\r\n\r\nresponsibility towards the country that they own and from\r\n\r\nthere comes a sense of belonging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Connected people. We spend millions\r\n\r\nevery  year building covered linkways to connect all  the\r\n\r\nHDB  blocks.  We must also build linkways to connect  the\r\n\r\nhearts  of Singaporeans.  I believe that Singaporeans  do\r\n\r\nhave  a heart but they need to be linked up.  We need  to\r\n\r\nencourage   and   build   stronger   relationship   among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Very often when a person is contemplating\r\n\r\nquitting Singapore, the one last thing that ties him back\r\n\r\nis  the  relationship  he has with his  friends  and  his\r\n\r\nrelatives here.  The stronger that sense of relationship,\r\n\r\nthe  more determined he will be to stay and fight.   This\r\n\r\nrelationship  must start at home.  A strong  family  bond\r\n\r\nwill  help spur a strong sense of belonging.  This  sense\r\n\r\nof  belonging  will  then motivate us to  strengthen  our\r\n\r\ncommunity  bonding.   With this, we can  begin  to  build\r\n\r\nrelationship with the nation and the individuals.   There\r\n\r\nis  no  short cut.  To try to develop a strong  sense  of\r\n\r\nnationalism  without strong family and community  bonding\r\n\r\nwill be an uphill task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Concerned people. We must change the bo-chap attitude of Singaporeans. I believe that most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo   chap.    Judging  from  the  heated  response   from\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to PM's speech, I think I am right.   And  I\r\n\r\nhope  I am right.  The question is whether we can further\r\n\r\nencourage this sense of ai-chap.  Can we get Singaporeans\r\n\r\nengaged?   Can we get them concerned?  Can  we  get  them\r\n\r\ninvolved?   It  is  always difficult to  walk  away  from\r\n\r\nsomething you have helped to build up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Proposed Initiatives</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with these three themes in mind, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  urge the Government  to  consider  three\r\n\r\ninitiatives:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to urge the Government to\r\n\r\nreview  our education policy to give greater emphasis  on\r\n\r\nbuilding  a strong character in our children.   Education\r\n\r\nis   fundamental  in  nation  building.    The   learning\r\n\r\ninstitutions have a vital role to play in the remaking of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    They   carry   with   them   the   great\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  shaping our future  generations.   In\r\n\r\nthis regard, I would like to make four suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, greater focus on character building in our\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   Our  strive  for  excellence   in   today's\r\n\r\nknowledge-based   economy  dictates   that   our   school\r\n\r\ncurriculum  has  to  focus  primarily  on  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nskills,   subjects  that  can  equip  our   children   to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the new economy, subjects  that  matter.\r\n\r\nOur  children  too  will focus on subjects  that  matter,\r\n\r\nnamely,  those  that will be tested  and  scored.   Other\r\n\r\nsubjects,  such  as  Hao Gong Min  are  given  much  less\r\n\r\nemphasis.   The  schools  must  provide  more  than  just\r\n\r\nknowledge  and  skills.   It is where  our  character  is\r\n\r\nmoulded and developed during the early days of our lives.\r\n\r\nIt   is  also  where  we  first  derive  our  values  and\r\n\r\nprinciples.   If we focus only on the hard  subjects,  we\r\n\r\nwill  produce an army of efficient workers, but  we  will\r\n\r\nnot produce citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can still recall the story of Yuefei, which I read\r\n\r\nduring  my primary school days.  His patriotic and heroic\r\n\r\nstory has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninspired  many, like me, to feel a sense of duty  to  the\r\n\r\nnation.  Yuefei was born in the year 1103.  When  he  was\r\n\r\nyoung, his mother tattooed four words on his back,  \"jing\r\n\r\nzhong  bao  guo\", which means \"be loyal  and  repay  your\r\n\r\ncountry\".   He  later became the general  commanding  the\r\n\r\narmies  of  the  Song dynasty.  During the 12th  century,\r\n\r\nwhen  China was attacked by invaders from the  north,  he\r\n\r\nled  the  Song  armies in defence of his  homeland.   His\r\n\r\nattempt  to  push north and recover all the lost  Chinese\r\n\r\nterritory  was opposed, however, by a peace party  within\r\n\r\nthe  capital headed by Minister Qinhui, who believed that\r\n\r\nfurther  prosecution  of the war  would  be  too  costly.\r\n\r\nQin's  faction  proved  more influential  and,  in  1141,\r\n\r\nYuefei  was  recalled to the Song court  and  imprisoned.\r\n\r\nLater,  he  was  executed, after  being  framed  by  Qin.\r\n\r\nYuefei's  dedication and commitment to his country  serve\r\n\r\nas  a  model for many Chinese patriots.  Many  songs  and\r\n\r\npoems  written by General Yuefei are still  cherished  by\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese today, and there are even movies made  about\r\n\r\nYuefei,  eg,  \"shi  er  jin pai\",  and  I  am  sure  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of  my vintage are also familiar  with  the\r\n\r\nstory of Yuefei.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real historical stories like these will inspire\r\n\r\nreaders to develop a sense of patriotism.  Yes, it  is  a\r\n\r\nstory  from  China,  but I am sure we  can  find  similar\r\n\r\nstories  from  other places as well.   I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  some of these should be incorporated  into\r\n\r\nour   school  curriculum,  especially  in  the   language\r\n\r\nlessons,  so  that there is no need to add on  the  load.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  instead of talking about  the  Tail  of  a\r\n\r\nSquirrel  (one  of the passages I read in  my  daughter's\r\n\r\nChinese  textbook), we can tell stories about  Yuefei  or\r\n\r\nabout  George Washington and his cherry tree.  This  way,\r\n\r\nwe can help build the character of our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is to introduce activities that\r\n\r\nencourage   teamwork   and   inculcate   a    sense    of\r\n\r\naccountability and responsibility in our schools.   These\r\n\r\ncan  either take the form of sports and games or  project\r\n\r\nwork.   It  is important for our children to  learn  from\r\n\r\nyoung that he is not alone and he cannot work alone.   He\r\n\r\nis part of the team and part of the big picture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThere  is a Chinese saying, \"xi sheng xiao wo, wan  cheng\r\n\r\nta  wao\",  which  means  to sacrifice  yourself  for  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the greater community.  These activities will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  demonstrate that only by making  individual\r\n\r\nsacrifices  -  be it time, interest or  money  -  can  we\r\n\r\nsucceed  and,  ultimately,  all  will  benefit  from  it.\r\n\r\nThrough these activities, they can also learn that  while\r\n\r\nothers  depend on them to do their best, they too  depend\r\n\r\non  others.   This  interdependence is the  beginning  of\r\n\r\nrelationship building and community bonding.  Let us  not\r\n\r\nunderestimate  the  impact of  some  of  these  seemingly\r\n\r\nsimple  and  childish  activities.   They  leave  a  long\r\n\r\nlasting impression on the minds of our young ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, develop greater tolerance for failures in our\r\n\r\nschools.   One of the causes of the kiasu syndrome  stems\r\n\r\nfrom  the  fact  that we have very little  tolerance  for\r\n\r\nsetbacks and failures.  In our competitive system  today,\r\n\r\nit  is  natural  that  failures are  costly,  whether  in\r\n\r\nschools, society or the economy.  However, there is again\r\n\r\na  Chinese saying, \"shi bai shi cheng gong zhi  mu\",  ie,\r\n\r\nfailure  is  the mother of success.  If we cannot  accept\r\n\r\nfailures,  we  cannot achieve success.  As we  develop  a\r\n\r\ngracious  society,  we  must also be  mindful  to  create\r\n\r\ngreater  capacity  for failures.  This way,  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  be  assured  of acceptance by the society  and  the\r\n\r\nnation, despite their shortcomings, and they do not  need\r\n\r\nto run to another country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children in schools must be taught to expect\r\n\r\nfailures, and that perseverance will eventually  lead  to\r\n\r\nsuccess.  I remember when I first went to the UK  for  my\r\n\r\nuniversity   education,  I  had  great  difficulties   in\r\n\r\nhandling the laboratory sessions.  The instruction sheets\r\n\r\ngiven  to  me  had no instructions at all.   They  merely\r\n\r\nstated  the requirements.  It was up to us to figure  out\r\n\r\nwhat  to do.  My teammate - another Singaporean -  and  I\r\n\r\ntried  every  other way but could not  get  the  results.\r\n\r\nFinally,  after some four hours and after all  the  other\r\n\r\nstudents  had gone home, we figured it out.  We  did  not\r\n\r\nfail.   We  merely found a dozen ways that did not  work.\r\n\r\nOur  schools should also consider introducing  open-ended\r\n\r\nactivities and programmes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlike  these  that require our children to  try  and  keep\r\n\r\ntrying.   This  way, we will build a strong character  in\r\n\r\nthem  that  can accept failures of others as well  as  of\r\n\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four, revamp our National Education Programme. The\r\n\r\nobjectives behind the NEP are good.  But if the programme\r\n\r\ncannot  effectively reach out to our children,  it  could\r\n\r\nnot  serve  our purpose.  I believe that the  subject  of\r\n\r\nNational  Education is a subject of  the  heart,  and  it\r\n\r\ncannot  be taught by simply reciting to them our nation's\r\n\r\nshort  history.   Colourful as it  may  be,  the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration may find it hard to relate.  Unlike the  first\r\n\r\nand second generation Singaporeans who have lived through\r\n\r\nthe  early  years  of separation from  Malaysia  and  the\r\n\r\nstruggle   against   communist   infiltration,   the   3G\r\n\r\ngeneration   has  grown  up  in  relative  security   and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that to be successful in our National\r\n\r\nEducation  effort,  we  need to  take  a  more  practical\r\n\r\napproach.   I  would like to suggest that we enhance  and\r\n\r\nexpand  the  Community  Involvement  Programme  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.   If  we allow our students to be involved  more\r\n\r\nactively in community and national development, no matter\r\n\r\nhow big or small it is, it will give them a greater sense\r\n\r\nof   ownership.   We  can  even  encourage  our  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions to organise groups that discuss  and  debate\r\n\r\nabout  Government  policies.  This will generate  greater\r\n\r\nawareness and engagement.  There are risks no doubt,  but\r\n\r\nthe  reward  of having a committed citizen is well  worth\r\n\r\nthe risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second initiative: I would like to urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment to review our social policies to build a home,\r\n\r\nand  not  a  hotel.   A hotel may have 5-star  facilities\r\n\r\ncompared  to my small apartment, but it is not  my  home.\r\n\r\nWhat  makes  a home?  A home is a place where  I  have  a\r\n\r\nrelationship  with  my  family members,  my  parents,  my\r\n\r\nspouse  and my children.  A home is a place where I  have\r\n\r\nsome say in how it is run.  A home is a haven that I long\r\n\r\nto  return  to for safety and security and,  when  it  is\r\n\r\nthreatened, I would not hesitate to defend it with all  I\r\n\r\nhave got.  I am almost certain that all of us would agree\r\n\r\nwith this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperception  of home.  The issue is: how do  we  make  our\r\n\r\nnation our home?  I would like to make three suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, strengthen our family bonding. If we do not\r\n\r\nfeel  at home in our own home, we cannot feel at home  in\r\n\r\nour country.  Therefore, we must start with strengthening\r\n\r\nour family ties.  In one of my dialogue sessions with  my\r\n\r\nresidents, some of them suggested that we need more space\r\n\r\nand  avenues  for family outings and activities.   Today,\r\n\r\none  of  the  most  favourite family pastimes  is  window\r\n\r\nshopping.   This does nothing to strengthen family  ties.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, it weakens the pocket and creates more  stress.\r\n\r\nWe   must   create   more   affordable   and   convenient\r\n\r\ndestinations  for  families and  friends.   Some  of  our\r\n\r\nattractions,  such as the zoo, the bird  park,  etc,  are\r\n\r\ndesigned for tourists, and may not be resident or family-friendly.  For example, can we make a conscious effort to\r\n\r\nreview the entrance charges to promote family tickets  or\r\n\r\nseason  tickets?  Or we can even have a universal  family\r\n\r\npass  to  allow discounted entries to all our attractions\r\n\r\nthe  whole  year round, so long as they come as  a  whole\r\n\r\nfamily.   This way, we will draw them away from  all  the\r\n\r\nshops   to  spend  time  with  each  other  in  wholesome\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a Children's Day, a Youth Day, a\r\n\r\nMother's Day and a Father's Day.  Maybe, we should have a\r\n\r\nFamily Day where families take centrestage, and make it a\r\n\r\npublic  holiday.   This will go a long way  to  reminding\r\n\r\nSingaporeans of the value of our family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, strengthen social and community bonding.\r\n\r\nYesterday's  newspaper quoted Mr Wee Cho  Yaw  as  saying\r\n\r\nthat  there  is little meaningful interaction  among  the\r\n\r\nvarious  racial groups despite the peaceful  co-existence\r\n\r\nfor  many  years.  I hope he is wrong.  But we must  have\r\n\r\nrealistic expectations.  The differences in our  cultural\r\n\r\nand  religious background are not easy to bridge.  It may\r\n\r\ntake   several   generations  before   progress   becomes\r\n\r\napparent.   But  we must not quit.  We must  continue  to\r\n\r\nbuild on social and community bonding.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWe   must  develop  individual's  relationship  with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  From my experience, I find it most  effective\r\n\r\nwhen  people work together on certain projects  and  they\r\n\r\ndevelop an esprit de corp as they go through the process.\r\n\r\nThey  learn  to  respect and accept  one  another.   They\r\n\r\ndevelop a special bonding among themselves.  As community\r\n\r\nleaders,  they can then help to expand this same  bonding\r\n\r\nto  other residents.  I would like to urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  give more resources and greater mandate to the Inter-Racial Confidence Circles for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for social bonding is not just among\r\n\r\ndifferent  races.  Even within the same  race,  there  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  need to strengthen our bonds.  When we lived  in\r\n\r\nkampongs  in  the old days, we were much  closer  to  one\r\n\r\nanother,  although we were physically further apart.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to  re-kindle that kampong spirit to  re-build  the\r\n\r\ndepth of community bonding.  Recently, I attended several\r\n\r\nlantern  festivals within our GRC and  I  was  pleasantly\r\n\r\nsurprised  by  the large turn-out, from different  races,\r\n\r\nnot  just the Chinese.  This is due in no small  part  to\r\n\r\nthe  hard work of the grassroots leaders, and I must also\r\n\r\nthank our Mayor, Dr Teo Ho Pin, for his support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it leads me to ask the question: what is in it\r\n\r\nthat  attracts the people?  Perhaps it is more than  just\r\n\r\nthe  makan  and  the goodie bags.  Some  of  them  simply\r\n\r\nbrought their kids along and joined in the fun.  They lit\r\n\r\nup  candles on the pavement, much to the annoyance of the\r\n\r\ntown councils, and they chatted with one another.  If  we\r\n\r\ncan   promote  more  of  these  traditional  and  festive\r\n\r\ncultural  events, it will help foster greater interaction\r\n\r\r\namong our residents.  Perhaps the Government can consider\r\n\r\nsponsoring  a few major events like these,  in  order  to\r\n\r\ngive them the resources and the recognition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, let people have some say. There has been\r\n\r\nmuch  criticism of the Government for failing to take  in\r\n\r\nfeedback  seriously.  I agree that we cannot  govern  the\r\n\r\ncountry  based  on feedback alone.  The Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nexample  of seeing a doctor on slimming pills is  a  good\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBut  I would suggest that Singaporeans' relationship with\r\n\r\nthe  nation  is  not  that  of a patient  consulting  his\r\n\r\ndoctor.   It  is a family affair.  Singapore  is  not  my\r\n\r\nclinic but my home.  In the past, whatever my father says\r\n\r\ngoes.   Now, whatever I say, my daughters will ask \"why?\"\r\n\r\nand  my wife will go \"why not?\", and a debate will ensue.\r\n\r\nEventually,  my wife or myself will make a decision,  but\r\n\r\nnot  without painstakingly explaining to my children  the\r\n\r\nrationale for the decision.  They may not always be happy\r\n\r\nwith the outcome, but they are usually satisfied that due\r\n\r\nconsideration has been given to their views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, it is important for the Government to\r\n\r\nexplain  its  decisions carefully and thoroughly  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  minimise misunderstandings.  The recent  fare\r\n\r\nincrease  is  a  case in point.  While the people  accept\r\n\r\nthat  cost increases may be inevitable, the communication\r\n\r\nprocess can be improved.  Singaporeans need to be assured\r\n\r\nthat    the   Government   understands   their    current\r\n\r\ndifficulties and have factored them into their decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication and mutual understanding is the basic\r\n\r\nfoundation of a closely-knit family and a loving home.  I\r\n\r\nwould therefore urge all Government agencies to make  the\r\n\r\nextra  effort  in obtaining feedback proactively  and  to\r\n\r\ntake  pains  to explain tough policies to our people,  so\r\n\r\nthat they can feel part of this big family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, other than education policy and\r\n\r\nsocial  policy, the third initiative relates to the  need\r\n\r\nto review our economic policy to strike a balance between\r\n\r\neconomic  progress and social cohesion.  As our  economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring  progresses,  there  is  a  risk  that   an\r\n\r\nincreasing  number of Singaporeans may feel left  behind.\r\n\r\nThey  either cannot adapt to the new economy or may  find\r\n\r\nit  very  painful to do so.  They feel that they  can  no\r\n\r\nlonger fit into the family and they have no choice but to\r\n\r\nquit.   Worse, some of them cannot even afford  to  quit,\r\n\r\ngiven  the limited resources they have.  So even if  they\r\n\r\nhave  not physically quit from Singapore, they have  done\r\n\r\nso  emotionally.  This is a real problem that  we  should\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nignore.  To this, I would like to make three suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, make space for every Singaporean. We must\r\n\r\nensure  that all Singaporeans have a place in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nnot  just for the elite, so long as he tries his best and\r\n\r\nregardless  of his achievements.  We cannot  abandon  the\r\n\r\nmeritocracy  philosophy as it is the very  basis  of  our\r\n\r\nexistence and success so far.  But if we continue to tell\r\n\r\nour  people  that there is no free lunch  and  that  they\r\n\r\neither  wake  up or lose out, the message we  are  giving\r\n\r\nthem  may  be  interpreted as telling them  to  fend  for\r\n\r\nthemselves and that we will do whatever it takes to  move\r\n\r\non.  We cannot say that to a family member, even if he is\r\n\r\nhandicapped and, especially, if he is handicapped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, my 6-year-old daughter came home from a\r\n\r\ncartoon  movie,  Lilo and Stitch.  She  quoted  to  me  a\r\n\r\nphrase  from  the  show.  She said,  \"Dad,  Ohanna  means\r\n\r\nfamily.\"   Family means nobody gets left  behind.   As  a\r\n\r\nfamily, we must give every member a fair chance, fair  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to each person's ability.  If one  of  them  is\r\n\r\nslower but he has tried his best, we cannot abandon  him.\r\n\r\nWe must assure him that there is a place in Singapore for\r\n\r\nhim because this is his home.  He may not get the job  he\r\n\r\nwishes but there are always job opportunities for him  so\r\n\r\nlong  as  he  tries and is willing to  be  flexible.   So\r\n\r\ninstead  of  telling our people that  there  is  no  free\r\n\r\nlunch,  perhaps we should change the tune and  tell  them\r\n\r\nthat we will help them to find their lunch.  We must tell\r\n\r\nthem  that every Singaporean matters, whether you  are  a\r\n\r\ntaxi  driver or an SIA pilot, whether you are a  mechanic\r\n\r\nor  a  biochemist, whether you are a professional  or  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneur - you have a place and a role in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nYou  can  always contribute meaningfully.  You matter  to\r\n\r\nus.  And in return, Singapore will matter to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, create alternative career opportunities. Not\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans can fit into the main stream.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthem may not be as good academically but they may be able\r\n\r\nto  excel in other fields, arts, sports, etc.  If we  can\r\n\r\nopen up new avenues for these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople to pursue their career development, it would  help\r\n\r\nto  demonstrate that we care about them and help persuade\r\n\r\nthem  to  remain committed to Singapore.  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nRemaking Singapore Committee is addressing this issue and\r\n\r\nI eagerly await its report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, balance economic progress with social\r\n\r\nprogress.    As  we pursue economic excellence,  we  must\r\n\r\nbalance  it  with  strengthening of  our  social  fabric.\r\n\r\nThose doing better must have a sense of responsibility to\r\n\r\ncare  for  those  who  may  need  an  extra  hand.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  needs  to  take the  lead.   We  are  rightly\r\n\r\nconcerned  that our help may be abused.   But  those  who\r\n\r\nabuse  the system are quitters because they have  already\r\n\r\nquit  trying to do the right thing but, thankfully, these\r\n\r\nare  the  exceptions.   The  EDRS,  for  example,  is   a\r\n\r\nmeaningful gesture to show that we care.  Although  there\r\n\r\nwere abuses, to the majority who have benefited from  it,\r\n\r\nit  was a huge success.  I am not suggesting that we open\r\n\r\nup  a  floodgate on our welfare schemes.  However,  I  am\r\n\r\nsuggesting that perhaps we can afford to be more  helpful\r\n\r\nand  not  deny  help to those who really need  it  simply\r\n\r\nbecause we are fearful of abuse by those who may not need\r\n\r\nit.   This may be a fundamental shift from the Government\r\n\r\npolicy today but this is what family is all about, mutual\r\n\r\nhelp and support.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Motion on stayers and quitters\r\n\r\nis  intended to spark debate in Parliament on  issues  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans' commitment to the country.  The process  of\r\n\r\nnation  building  has no short cut.  It will  not  happen\r\n\r\novernight.   But  it is a crucial issue, particularly  at\r\n\r\nthis  point  in time when Singapore is at the  crossroad.\r\n\r\nPM's  speech  was a timely reminder that we  cannot  take\r\n\r\nthis  for  granted.  As we rebuild our economy,  we  must\r\n\r\nalso  build a home, not a hotel.  This will take not only\r\n\r\nthe  efforts of the Government alone, but the efforts  of\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans,  of  all the members  in  the  family.\r\n\r\nTogether, we can build a home where Singaporeans  have  a\r\n\r\nsay in its shape and size, a home where\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  a  part in  building,  a  home  where\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have relationships with one another,  and  a\r\n\r\nhome  where  Singaporeans will stay to fight and  defend.\r\n\r\nWe must build a home that is uniquely Singaporeans' home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  decided  to  move this Motion together with  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember,   Gan  Kim  Yong,  because  I  sense   increasing\r\n\r\nfrustration among the younger generation with  the  state\r\n\r\nof  our society, and a feeling of disconnection with  the\r\n\r\npresent system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the various surveys and my own dialogues\r\n\r\nwith  the  younger Singaporeans, it is clear to  me  that\r\n\r\nthere is a profound longing for a new kind of society.  A\r\n\r\nsociety  that  will listen to their voices,  and  respect\r\n\r\nthem as partners in the development of policy.  A society\r\n\r\nthat is rooted in a strong sense of national identity and\r\n\r\ncommunity, and guided by a vision of a renewed society in\r\n\r\nwhich all count and none is excluded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sense is reinforced by the recent debate on\r\n\r\n\"stayers\" and \"quitters\" which was sparked off  by  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Goh Chok Tong's National Day Rally speech.  Some\r\n\r\nsay  that it is a not a new debate.  Indeed, as far  back\r\n\r\nas  1967,  Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, then  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  had  used  such  terms  in  his  speech  at  a\r\n\r\nconvocation  dinner of the then University of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHis main message to the younger Singaporeans at that time\r\n\r\nwas:  \"The future is what we make of it.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that future is now here. We are advanced in\r\n\r\nsocial  and economic terms.  We enjoy peace and  relative\r\n\r\nprosperity.  But something is missing.  We are  not  sure\r\n\r\nwho  we  are  and  what being a Singapore citizen  means.\r\n\r\nWhat are we staying and fighting for?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms used - \"stayer\" and \"quitter\" - may be the\r\n\r\nsame as those\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nused  in the late 1960s, but the debate today is not  the\r\n\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this post-Cold War world and a very rapidly\r\n\r\nglobalising  one,  politics has become dominated  by  the\r\n\r\nmore  complex questions of identity.  We can see this  in\r\n\r\nthe  rise in ethnic and religious clashes within  states,\r\n\r\nand  the  revival  of  global  religions  in  the  world.\r\n\r\nAdvanced IT has given ethnic and religious movements  new\r\n\r\nopportunities for spreading their message and the  tribal\r\n\r\nconflicts that they sometimes spawn.  Groups which do not\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  global capitalism seek  to  retreat  to  a\r\n\r\nsimpler world, often offered by the ancient religions and\r\n\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With increasing democracy, some ethnic and religious\r\n\r\ngroups   are  questioning  the  way  their  country   has\r\n\r\nconstituted  itself  and what it means  to  them  as  its\r\n\r\nmembers.  We can see this debate being played out in  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries as Muslim groups  questioned  how\r\n\r\nIslamic   their  country  should  be.   In  that   sense,\r\n\r\nglobalisation  and increased democracy in this  post-Cold\r\n\r\nWar  world  have  given  a  particularly  sharp  edge  to\r\n\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a world and in a region that have lost the old\r\n\r\norder,  Singaporeans cannot escape the question  of  what\r\n\r\ntheir  statehood is made of.  This question rings  louder\r\n\r\nas,  in  a  globalised world, countries  seem  to  become\r\n\r\nincreasingly similar in the political and economic  sense\r\n\r\nthrough  the adoption of democracy and a market  economy.\r\n\r\nIt is as if the world is shrinking into a giant McDonalds\r\n\r\nrestaurant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mass migration is another aspect of globalisation.\r\n\r\nPeople  are  increasingly mobile and they  go  where  the\r\n\r\nopportunities  are.   This  interplay  of  trends  forces\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to ask themselves who they are,  where  they\r\n\r\nbelong and what makes their country special.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Singaporean puts it very simply: \"The world is\r\n\r\ngetting  more  global,  so there  is  nothing  that  sets\r\n\r\nSingapore  apart from other places.\"  I feel that  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  to  paint  this complex backdrop  during  this\r\n\r\ndebate  because  it is too easy to frame this  debate  as\r\n\r\nonly a problem with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsoft  3G  generation born with a golden  spoon  in  their\r\n\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with such a view is that, other than\r\n\r\nbeing  simplistic,  it  renders any soul-searching  about\r\n\r\nnational  identity as an unearned luxury.   The  fact  is\r\n\r\nthat the attitudes of the younger generation towards  the\r\n\r\ncountry has changed because the world has changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question before us is how to strengthen their\r\n\r\nsense   of   belonging  to  Singapore   given   all   the\r\n\r\nuncertainties and complexities of the present.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our Motion, we called for a thorough review of\r\n\r\npolicies  and programmes and for \"meaningful changes\"  to\r\n\r\nbe  made.   I  would like to highlight three  reviews  in\r\n\r\nthree distinct areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, at a time when our separate ethnic identities\r\n\r\nare  advancing to the fore, we should review  our  multi-cultural  policies and programmes to ensure that  greater\r\n\r\nstress  is  placed on our common civic identity  and  our\r\n\r\ncommon cultural heritage.  Our civic identity refers to a\r\n\r\nway  of  life where citizens define themselves and pursue\r\n\r\ncommonly-held goals.  It includes fundamental values such\r\n\r\nas   equality  of  treatment,  equality  of  opportunity,\r\n\r\nmeritocracy   and   multi-racialism.    This   is    what\r\n\r\ncitizenship  in Singapore is about - who we are,  how  we\r\n\r\nlive together, what type of people we want to become.  It\r\n\r\ndefines  to  what  or whom we give our  loyalty,  how  we\r\n\r\nrelate to other citizens.  It is a normative concept, and\r\n\r\nstems from a moral point of view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrests of the Jemaah Islamiyah members recently\r\n\r\nhighlight how conflicting loyalties and subscribing to  a\r\n\r\nvery  different moral view of the world can threaten  the\r\n\r\nviability  and security of our nation.  Yet,  at  a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  we  should be forging common goals as Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nmy  feeling is that we seem to be dealing with the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity more and more as a separate group, to be led by\r\n\r\ntheir Malay/Muslim political leaders.  For instance, take\r\n\r\nthe  announcement that the Minister-in-charge  of  Muslim\r\n\r\nAffairs, Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim and his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nteam of Malay MPs want to build a community of excellence\r\n\r\nfor  the Malay/Muslim community.  This is a laudable goal\r\n\r\nand  I  am  sure Singaporeans of all races and  religions\r\n\r\nwould  support this.  But I would think this  is  also  a\r\n\r\nnational  goal,  to  help each other achieve  excellence.\r\n\r\nYet,  all  the  discussions on achieving a  community  of\r\n\r\nexcellence  for the Malay/Muslims have not  included  the\r\n\r\nother  races, as if they are a group apart.   Even  as  a\r\n\r\nMember  of  Parliament, I have not been briefed  on  what\r\n\r\nthis   community  of  excellence  for  the   Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  means, what does it entail, and if  my  multi-racial grassroots organisations and I can play a role  in\r\n\r\nhelping my Malay residents to achieve that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with setting different goals\r\n\r\nfor the different communities, but I would ask for a more\r\n\r\ninclusive and multi-racial approach to helping the groups\r\n\r\nachieve these goals.  We must give each group a sense  of\r\n\r\nsharing  a  full and equal membership in the nation-state\r\n\r\nand not let anyone feel singled out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an overwhelming constituency in this\r\n\r\ncountry,  especially  the younger generation,  who  would\r\n\r\nlike to see the ideals of multi-racialism and aspirations\r\n\r\nfor  racial equality upheld.  But as ever with race, such\r\n\r\nconclusions   must   be  tempered  by  complexities   and\r\n\r\ncontradictions.  Progress towards racial harmony is often\r\n\r\nuneven.  Attitudes  towards foreign  talents  provide  an\r\n\r\nexample.  You can be a Chinese Singaporean and yet  still\r\n\r\nvery  unhappy if a Chinese athlete from China wins medals\r\n\r\nfor Singapore under a Singapore passport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such kneejerk responses and our less than coherent\r\n\r\nmulti-cultural policies leave new Singapore citizens with\r\n\r\nno  clear  vision  of the country they  have  joined.   I\r\n\r\nsuspect  that this is because we ourselves are not  clear\r\n\r\nabout  it.  In the absence of a compelling, all-embracing\r\n\r\nvision, parochial and sectarian interests are filling the\r\n\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to our common cultural heritage. We\r\n\r\nare Southeast Asian, and yet\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  highlight  or inculcate  this  as  a  common\r\n\r\ncultural  heritage.  We encourage Singaporeans  to  trace\r\n\r\ntheir  roots  to their ancestral homelands,  saying  that\r\n\r\nsuch  Asian  traditions anchor their sense  of  identity.\r\n\r\nBut we are not the same with the Chinese in China and  we\r\n\r\nknow it, and the same goes for the other races, like  the\r\n\r\nIndians  in  India  - they are quite different  from  the\r\n\r\nIndians  in Singapore.  We have more in common  with  our\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asian neighbours than China and India and  far-off  places  that  we  call  ancestral  homelands.   Just\r\n\r\nobserve  Singaporean  students  abroad.   Whatever  their\r\n\r\nrace,  their  instinct is to group  with  Malaysians  and\r\n\r\nother Southeast Asians when they go out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say that our national language is Malay, yet we\r\n\r\nput little effort in getting all Singaporeans to learn it\r\n\r\nand  speak it, other than the Malays themselves as  their\r\n\r\nsecond language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may rationalise that it may be expedient to\r\n\r\nsignal to the world that we are different from the region\r\n\r\n-  after  all, some countries in the region are  not  the\r\n\r\nbest  advertisements for secular progress.  But  national\r\n\r\nidentity  is not to be dictated by short-term  expediency\r\n\r\nor to be manufactured just to attract foreign investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a question of who we are and our common\r\n\r\ndestiny.   And our destiny is in Southeast Asia,  whether\r\n\r\nwe  like it or not.  We might as well embrace it and make\r\n\r\nthe  best of it.  To deny that is to rob ourselves of the\r\n\r\nrichness  of  the Southeast Asian culture  and  heritage.\r\n\r\nAnd  to  allow  either  the bland,  shallow  sameness  of\r\n\r\ncosmopolitanism  to  take over, or the  narrow  sectarian\r\n\r\npressures of ethnic identity to take hold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is to review our policy to\r\n\r\nensure  that our social and political development is  not\r\n\r\nout of step with our economic development.  For instance,\r\n\r\nwomen  have made great strides in Singapore and  yet  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  insists  in  upholding  and  preserving   the\r\n\r\npatriarchal system, choosing tradition over civic  values\r\n\r\nenshrined  in  the  Constitution  and  embedded  in   our\r\n\r\nnational pledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the commitment to a more just society\r\n\r\nupholding   equality  of  opportunity,  some   Government\r\n\r\npolicies  seem  to  cast women in a  secondary  role,  as\r\n\r\nsubmissive, passive women whose paramount mission  is  to\r\n\r\nfulfil the roles of a wife and mother.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could be deprived of an opportunity to become a\r\n\r\ndoctor  just  because  they  are  women;  they  could  be\r\n\r\ndeprived of equal medical benefits just because they  are\r\n\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national identity that is based on patriarchy\r\n\r\nexcludes women.  Gender equality issues that we raise  in\r\n\r\nthis  House repeatedly should not be treated as  separate\r\n\r\n\"women's  issues\",  as they tend to  be  in  this  House.\r\n\r\nThese are structural questions which confront society  in\r\n\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fundamental question is whether Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfeel  that  they  are being treated as citizens  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry, or as consumers of goods and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since independence, Singapore has implemented rapid\r\n\r\neconomic  reforms, which brought us great progress.   But\r\n\r\nthe pace of economic reform is often out of step with our\r\n\r\nsocial  and  political development.   This  has  profound\r\n\r\nconsequences for the notion of citizenship.  The language\r\n\r\nof  the  economy places strong emphasis on the individual\r\n\r\n-   mainly as the consumer of goods and services  -   and\r\n\r\nit  is often an individual divorced from the wider social\r\n\r\nand  political  context.  You do not feel rooted  if  the\r\n\r\ncountry  only  appeals  to your salary  packet  and  your\r\n\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans have expressed the hope for a less\r\n\r\nstressful society, as Mr Gan has pointed out.  The stress\r\n\r\nfactors  often cited include the rising cost  of  living,\r\n\r\nand  a  pressuring education system.  Rather than dismiss\r\n\r\nsuch concerns or defend the status quo, I would urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to conduct a transparent and open-minded study\r\n\r\non these issues and see how these concerns can be eased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revive the Cost Review Committee, if need be. Of\r\n\r\nlate, the Government agencies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  been  justifying some price rises by saying,  well,\r\n\r\nprices  have to go up because Singaporeans want a  higher\r\n\r\nstandard  of living and  Singaporeans just have to  learn\r\n\r\nhow  to pay for the higher quality of services that  they\r\n\r\nwant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such arguments treat Singaporeans like consumers\r\n\r\nwith  endless  wants,  while they  have  been  trying  to\r\n\r\nrespond as citizens wanting to have a say in the pace  of\r\n\r\nchange at this difficult time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a disconnect. Their increasing frustration\r\n\r\nwith  the system arises from a sense of impotence, a lack\r\n\r\nof  control  over  the  future.   A  consequence  is  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  clamour for political reform  which  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  hearing, such as that put forward by the  Political\r\n\r\nMatters and Media Group of the Feedback Unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such ideas are worth engaging and exploring with\r\n\r\nrespect,  not  because  these are  all  good  ideas,  but\r\n\r\nbecause   they   reflect   the  emerging   debate   about\r\n\r\ncitizenship.   They reinforce the recurrent  theme,  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must  now learn to take responsibility  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own  destiny - and mistakes  -  and  overcome  the\r\n\r\ntendency to blame others.  The strong desire for a better\r\n\r\nsociety and community is constantly linked with the  need\r\n\r\nfor greater participation and partnership in power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my third suggestion, which is to\r\n\r\nreview  our  National Education programme,  a  suggestion\r\n\r\nalso  made  by Mr Gan.  I feel that we must  take  urgent\r\n\r\nsteps to prepare individuals to participate as active and\r\n\r\nresponsible citizens in a democracy.  For this, we should\r\n\r\nconsider introducing citizenship education as part of our\r\n\r\nNational Education curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Britain, it produced the Crick Report on\r\n\r\nCitizenship  Education  in 1998 and,  as  a  result,  the\r\n\r\nsubject has formed part of the core curriculum from  this\r\n\r\nyear.  The aim of the new subject in the UK is to produce\r\n\r\nactive  and  responsible citizens, aware of their  rights\r\n\r\nand responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, I think it is a rare student who knows\r\n\r\nclearly  the  role  of Parliament and  the  role  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident.  Our students\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed  to  learn  more  about  the  political  system   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  how  it works, how it has  evolved  over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  how that relates to the citizens and their rights\r\n\r\nand  responsibilities as citizens.  They  need  to  learn\r\n\r\nthat  Parliament is indeed the highest policy-making body\r\n\r\nin  the land.  Sometimes, when I look and see students up\r\n\r\nthere  (points  to  students in the  public  gallery),  I\r\n\r\nwonder  what they go back and tell their parents, whether\r\n\r\nthey  say,  \"Really,  Parliament is  where  policies  are\r\n\r\nmade.\"   But  I  fear that some people are  beginning  to\r\n\r\nquestion that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to restore the role of Parliament in\r\n\r\npolicy  making.   It  will be to  our  detriment  if  the\r\n\r\nperception  that the views of MPs do not matter  or  that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  influence policies set in the public  mind.\r\n\r\nThe  man-in-the-street would ask: if the views of the MPs\r\n\r\ndo not count, what more the ordinary citizen!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that some of these issues that I have raised\r\n\r\nare  being addressed by the Remaking Singapore Committee,\r\n\r\nof  which  I  am  a  member.   This  Committee  has  been\r\n\r\ndescribed as the social and political counterpart of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Review Committee.  Yet, I cannot help but notice\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has moved faster  on  the  economic\r\n\r\nrecommendations  made  by the ERC  than  the  social  and\r\n\r\npolitical  ones made by the Remaking Singapore  Committee\r\n\r\n-   some  findings have been floated such  as  on  gender\r\n\r\nequality.   I know the Report will be out at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe  year,  but  some findings have been floated,  and  I\r\n\r\ncannot  help  but contrast the approach.   We  have  sub-committees   in  the  ERC.   They  have  released   their\r\n\r\nfindings.   Some  of them are very tough  recommendations\r\n\r\nlike  the  CPF cut for older workers.  Yet, we have  very\r\n\r\nquickly  seized them and implemented them  very  quickly.\r\n\r\nBut  for the Remaking Singapore Committee, we seem to  be\r\n\r\ntaking  our  time,  and even these recommendations  which\r\n\r\nhave been floated in public have not been responded to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, this debate is about our future\r\n\r\nand our sense of place in a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfast-changing  world.  In his National Day Rally  speech,\r\n\r\nPM  Goh mentioned a dialogue with younger Singaporeans in\r\n\r\nMay   -  the  one  where he noted that more  than  three-quarters  of  the  students  expressed  pessimism   about\r\n\r\nSingapore's future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happened to chair that dialogue, as part of the\r\n\r\nRemaking Singapore Committee's effort to consult  younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   During that dialogue, it struck  me  that\r\n\r\nthose  who  were optimistic about Singapore's future  had\r\n\r\none   view  in  common.   They  had  confidence  in  this\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government has never been afraid of\r\n\r\nchange.   The  younger generation hopes and expects  that\r\n\r\nthe  new  MPs  and others in this House would  lead  that\r\n\r\nchange,  to  help  develop  a new  culture  of  openness,\r\n\r\naccountability  and participation, in  which  the  people\r\n\r\nreally are partners in the development of policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

At that time, the British were withdrawing\r\n\r\ntheir  troops.   That  meant that  Singapore  was  losing\r\n\r\nsomething  like 20% of its income.  In the face  of  that\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  condition, I  think  when  he  mentioned\r\n\r\n\"stayers\" and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"quitters\",  it was a challenge to Singaporeans  to  stay\r\n\r\nbehind and help build Singapore.  Prime Minister Goh Chok\r\n\r\nTong  also alluded to stayers and quitters in his  recent\r\n\r\nNational  Day  Rally  speech.   But,  this  time,  he  is\r\n\r\nreferring to the younger Singaporeans who apparently have\r\n\r\nnot known hardship.  SM Lee mentioned the words \"stayers\"\r\n\r\nand  \"quitters\" something like 35 years ago.   They  were\r\n\r\ndifferent  times.  At that time, Singaporeans  were  very\r\n\r\npoor  and  unemployment  was  rife.   It  was  definitely\r\n\r\ndifficult even to get a job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I believe the class of people that SM Lee\r\n\r\nreferred to 35 years ago, the people whom he wanted  them\r\n\r\nto  stay behind to help build Singapore, were in the same\r\n\r\nclass  as  the  people that PM Goh has  mentioned  today.\r\n\r\nThey were the educated and professional class.  They were\r\n\r\nneeded  in Singapore to help build the country.  But,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, not all left when the chips were down.  Many were\r\n\r\nstill  committed to Singapore.  But, however,  apparently\r\n\r\ntoday,  young Singaporean professionals are  leaving  our\r\n\r\nshores.    There  is  an  increase  in  the   number   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans migrating, a rise from 14% last  October  to\r\n\r\n21%   this   July.    It  would  appear  that   basically\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are still the same and have not changed.  In\r\n\r\nbad  times, some also want to leave Singapore.  And  even\r\n\r\nin good times, they also want to leave Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the issue is: Is there anything wrong with that?\r\n\r\nI  personally  do  not think so.  I think  the  issue  is\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not Singaporeans are committed to Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhy   is  the  Government  so  alarmed  when  there   are\r\n\r\nprofessionals   emigrating   from   Singapore?    I   can\r\n\r\nunderstand  why  the  PAP is so alarmed.   Probably  they\r\n\r\nthink  that  they will have less talent  pool  to  select\r\n\r\ntheir  election candidates.  I think one of the strongest\r\n\r\nreasons  why young professionals are leaving  is  because\r\n\r\nthey  are not rooted here.  There must be something wrong\r\n\r\nwith  the  education  system  that  does  not  make  them\r\n\r\nemotionally  attached to this country.   Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nphysical environment has completely changed.  Probably in\r\n\r\nthe  earlier  years  of  these  youngsters,  they  saw  a\r\n\r\ndifferent Singapore.  Their early physical surroundings\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  all been destroyed.  We see that old buildings  are\r\n\r\nso  readily torn down to be replaced by high-rise  flats,\r\n\r\ncondominiums   and   shopping   complexes.    Their   old\r\n\r\nsurroundings are completely gone and the whole  place  is\r\n\r\nunrecognisable  to these youngsters.  Young  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave become strangers in their own homeland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the influences that cause Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nmigrate are Government policies which force some of  them\r\n\r\nto  go overseas and want to remain overseas.  One of such\r\n\r\npolicies  is  that  the  Government  does  not  recognise\r\n\r\nuniversity degrees obtained through distance learning.  I\r\n\r\nhave  been  told  that degrees obtained through  distance\r\n\r\nlearning  are as good as the ones obtained from  actually\r\n\r\ngoing   overseas  to  study.   But,  unfortunately,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment does not think so.  The Government's excuse is\r\n\r\nthat distance learning does not involve the intermingling\r\n\r\nof  these  students with other students.  The  Government\r\n\r\nfeels  that the intermingling of students when  one  goes\r\n\r\noverseas to study is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I must say that the more important issue\r\n\r\nis  whether  or  not the degrees obtained  from  distance\r\n\r\nlearning are as high a standard as those obtained by  the\r\n\r\nstudents  going  overseas to study.  The Government  must\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that those organising distance learning  give\r\n\r\ndegrees which are of high quality and recognise them,  so\r\n\r\nthat  our  students need not go overseas.  Once  they  go\r\n\r\noverseas, of course, there is a greater tendency for them\r\n\r\nto live overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of law degrees, the Government has\r\n\r\nstopped recognising external law degrees, that is,  those\r\n\r\ndegrees   obtained  by  distance  learning   or   through\r\n\r\ncorrespondence course.  Those degrees that  are  obtained\r\n\r\nby  correspondence are not recognised by the  Government.\r\n\r\nSo,  this kind of a policy, of course, forces more of our\r\n\r\nstudents to go overseas to study.  Once the students have\r\n\r\ngone overseas to study and experienced overseas life,  it\r\n\r\nwould therefore be more likely that they will migrate  if\r\n\r\ngiven  a  chance to do so, since they have already  lived\r\n\r\noverseas before.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think it is fair to call those wanting\r\n\r\nto  live  overseas  as  \"quitters\".   In  fact,  all  our\r\n\r\nforefathers  were \"quitters\".  Have they  done  something\r\n\r\nwrong  by  leaving  their homeland?  I certainly  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  so.  They left their home country to find a better\r\n\r\nlife  in  the  South seas.  In fact, if it were  not  for\r\n\r\nthose  so-called \"quitters\", Singapore may not have  been\r\n\r\nwhat  it  is  today.   Nearly all  our  first  generation\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders  were \"quitters\".   Their  forefathers\r\n\r\nmigrated to Malaysia and, in turn, they came to Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia.   In  fact, many of our  judges  and  top\r\n\r\nadministrators  can also be termed as  \"quitters.\"   They\r\n\r\nwere mostly from Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think that there is anything wrong for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to leave Singapore and live abroad, and they\r\n\r\nshould  not be labelled as \"quitters\".  I think we should\r\n\r\nnot  be  unduly worried if Singaporeans do go  abroad  to\r\n\r\nlive.   I believe that many of these Singaporeans who  go\r\n\r\nabroad  to  stay  there  still maintain  their  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship.   They  all still view  Singapore  as  their\r\n\r\nhome.   Perhaps  the  Minister  can  tell  us  how   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans living abroad have given up their  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  I believe the number is not that many.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a pity, on the one hand, the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  encourages Singaporeans to be entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nand to go abroad to the region and even further afield to\r\n\r\nlive  and do business and, on the other hand, we tend  to\r\n\r\nlabel  those who go abroad to stay as \"quitters\".  So,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Government in some respect is giving confusing\r\n\r\nsignals  to the people.  The Government should not  label\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who go abroad as \"quitters\" at  all.   There\r\n\r\nis,  in fact, nothing wrong for Singaporeans to go abroad\r\n\r\neither  to  stay or to do business, or for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\ntheir children's education.  Going abroad is not an  easy\r\n\r\nthing.   It needs a lot of courage.  It needs  a  lot  of\r\n\r\neffort  to go abroad.  And I think the Government  should\r\n\r\nbe  glad  that  Singaporeans  are  going  abroad  or  are\r\n\r\ncourageous  enough to go abroad.  In the  long  term,  if\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do go abroad,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit  should  be a good thing for Singapore, as  the  world\r\n\r\nwill  then  be  open to Singapore, but so  long  as  they\r\n\r\nremain committed to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  giving  me  the opportunity to participate  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand in support of the Motion and before I\r\n\r\nactually begin on the points I wanted to raise, it  would\r\n\r\nbe  useful to deal with the definition of \"quitters\"  and\r\n\r\n\"stayers\", because there appears to be some misconception\r\n\r\non this.  There has been a lot of heated debate on who is\r\n\r\na quitter, who is a stayer, and part of the misconception\r\n\r\nappears  to be from a misunderstanding of what the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  actually said.  That same misunderstanding  was\r\n\r\nactually reflected in Mr Chiam's speech just now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The misunderstanding is this. Some people seem to\r\n\r\nthink  that  just  because you leave Singapore,  you  are\r\n\r\nnecessarily  a  quitter.  That  is  not  what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said.  If you actually look at the text  of  his\r\n\r\nspeech, and for those who were sitting there listening to\r\n\r\nhim,  he  made it quite clear that those who are quitters\r\n\r\nare those who have severed their emotional links and ties\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore, those who will not come back to the  aid\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  or  contribute to Singapore  as  and  when\r\n\r\nneeded.  Just because somebody lives or works abroad does\r\n\r\nnot  mean that he or she is a quitter.  So long  as  they\r\n\r\nare  emotionally  connected, so long  as  they  care  for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  so  long as they want to contribute  in  some\r\n\r\nway, that person is very much a stayer.\r\n\r\nSo,  then, we have to ask ourselves, having regard to the\r\n\r\nthird  generation  Singaporeans and the  fact  that  with\r\n\r\nincreased mobility in today's globalised world,  what  is\r\n\r\nit that actually makes a person want to quit or leave, or\r\n\r\nto  sever  his  or her emotional ties with Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nthink,  in  this regard, there are actually  two  factors\r\n\r\nthat we must make a distinction.  One is the pull factor,\r\n\r\nand  the  other is the push factor.  I think pull factors\r\n\r\nare  where  the  person  does not  really  have  anything\r\n\r\nagainst Singapore but is just\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattracted  to  opportunities  or  things  abroad.    Take\r\n\r\nlawyers, for example, who have graduated in Singapore but\r\n\r\nwant  the opportunity to work abroad with offshore  firms\r\n\r\nsimply  because  of  being able  to  obtain  a  different\r\n\r\nexperience,  in  terms of type of work, live  in  another\r\n\r\ncountry,  get  to  meet  different people,  experience  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  lifestyle.  There is nothing wrong with  that.\r\n\r\nThere  is every reason to believe that, in years to come,\r\n\r\nthey  will  return to Singapore and hopefully bring  with\r\n\r\nthem  the  skills  and  the  experience  that  they  have\r\n\r\nacquired abroad.  I therefore do not see the pull factors\r\n\r\nas particularly disturbing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I think we should be careful about are the push\r\n\r\nfactors.   People are people.  What makes a  person  feel\r\n\r\nalienated  or  not  want to stay in a place?   That  only\r\n\r\nhappens  when  a  person  feels that  he  or  she  cannot\r\n\r\nprogress, or somehow is not part or cannot progress up in\r\n\r\na  system.  If you really analyse it, the human want  and\r\n\r\nhuman  need  are  quite basic.  People  want  safety  and\r\n\r\nsecurity.  And in Singapore, that is not an issue.  We do\r\n\r\nhave  a  safe and secure society.  So that is taken  care\r\n\r\nof.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing that people want is a certain\r\n\r\namount  of  personal happiness and that comes from  being\r\n\r\nable to work, being able to have a certain means by which\r\n\r\nyou can live and being able to achieve their aspirations.\r\n\r\nAnd  that  brings us really to the third point  which,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  is  the most critical component of a push  factor\r\n\r\nand,  that is, whether or not that person has the ability\r\n\r\nto achieve his or her aspiration in Singapore.  And if  a\r\n\r\nperson  cannot,  that is when a person  feels  pushed  to\r\n\r\nleave.  And the key to all of that is education.  I think\r\n\r\neducation  and  our education policy is the  single  most\r\n\r\nimportant factor in influencing a Singaporean's  decision\r\n\r\nas to whether or not to stay or to quit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say, at the outset, that, by and large, we\r\n\r\nhave an extremely good education system.  If you look  at\r\n\r\nit,  Singapore in the region has one of the  most  highly\r\n\r\neducated  populations.  It has enabled us to  achieve  an\r\n\r\noutstanding level of economic progress.  But I  do  think\r\n\r\nthat there is room for refinement and I do think that it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  important to listen to some of the feedback  that  we\r\n\r\nhave got from especially the young parents.  Because,  in\r\n\r\nevery  feedback  session, there will  be  something  said\r\n\r\nabout  education,  and  usually you  will  find  that  it\r\n\r\ntouches on the complaints, and the comments are many  and\r\n\r\nvaried.   But  when you actually analyse them,  it  falls\r\n\r\ninto  two large groups.  One is stress, and the other  is\r\n\r\nthe  ability  to choose or, at least, to have  a  certain\r\n\r\nfreedom  from restriction in choice of subject.  And  for\r\n\r\nmany young Singaporeans, especially couples, when I speak\r\n\r\nto  them and I ask them about issues like these, they are\r\n\r\nhappy to stay in Singapore for themselves.  But they  say\r\n\r\nthat  if they leave at all, it will be really because  of\r\n\r\ntheir children's education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps what I can do is to illustrate it by three\r\n\r\nor four examples.  One example is school ranking.  I know\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry  of  Education  has  defended  school\r\n\r\nranking quite vigorously, and the response has been that,\r\n\r\nto  some  extent,  it is the parents who  put  a  lot  of\r\n\r\npressure on the children.  But, in Singapore, people  and\r\n\r\nparents love their children.  They want their children to\r\n\r\nprogress.  So, obviously, they want their children to  be\r\n\r\nable to make it in the system.  So they are going to look\r\n\r\nat  the system.  We place a lot of emphasis on scholastic\r\n\r\nachievement and they want their children to  be  able  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the standard that the system requires  in  order\r\n\r\nfor  them  to  progress.   So the school  ranking  system\r\n\r\nactually  puts  a  lot of pressure on  the  children  and\r\n\r\nparents because what will happen is that the school feels\r\n\r\nthe  need  to  perform.   So the teachers  transfer  this\r\n\r\npressure  down  to  the  students and  parents,  and  the\r\n\r\nparents of course pressure their children as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do not think ranking per se is a bad thing\r\n\r\nbecause you need an element of competition.  But I  think\r\n\r\nthe  system could be fine-tuned.  Suggestions  have  been\r\n\r\nmade  that,  for example, instead of ranking each  school\r\n\r\nindividually, we should rank them in band, or  rank  them\r\n\r\naccording to types of subjects.  In other words,  broaden\r\n\r\nthe definition of success, alleviate some of the pressure\r\n\r\nand  allow people a greater degree of choice.  One of the\r\n\r\nthings that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas  happened as a result of the push for ranking is that\r\n\r\nLiterature  has  suffered simply because Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nScience  are  perceived as the subjects in  which  it  is\r\n\r\neasier  to  score  in.   It is not  that  you  cannot  do\r\n\r\nLiterature.    But  it is just that if you  think  it  is\r\n\r\neasier  to  score  in Mathematics and  Science,  that  is\r\n\r\nsomething that you will take, and Literature suffers as a\r\n\r\nresult.   And that also has an impact on society  because\r\n\r\nit has an impact on the way we speak, the creativity and,\r\n\r\nbasically, Literature is good for social interaction.  So\r\n\r\nwith the doing away or people not taking up Literature as\r\n\r\nmuch, it has a social impact.  That is just one example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example that has been raised is why is it\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporean children cannot study in  international\r\n\r\nschools.   Some parents do not understand  why  there  is\r\n\r\nthis  policy and feel that they would like their children\r\n\r\nto  have  the choice to study in an international school,\r\n\r\nif possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third example was something that was raised in\r\n\r\nthe  feedback  session  for the  Indian  community.   The\r\n\r\nfeedback was given that an Indian boy studying in  school\r\n\r\nwas  not allowed to take Japanese because he did not have\r\n\r\nMandarin as a first language.  The unhappiness there  was\r\n\r\nthat Japanese was available to be taught, but he was  not\r\n\r\nallowed to do it because he did not have Mandarin.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  sure,  because  it was not raised  at  the  feedback\r\n\r\nsession,  whether  this was the Ministry  of  Education's\r\n\r\npolicy,  or whether it was simply the school.   It  could\r\n\r\nwell  be  that they felt he would have better chances  of\r\n\r\nscoring  in Japanese if he had a Mandarin base.  But  the\r\n\r\nproblem is that when you tell a person that he cannot  do\r\n\r\nsomething where he has an interest and he wants to do it,\r\n\r\nit denies him a chance of a personal aspiration.  Then it\r\n\r\nmakes him feel that he cannot progress and he cannot move\r\n\r\nup  into  the  system.  It is little, little things  like\r\n\r\nthat  that  basically make parents want to move  to  give\r\n\r\ntheir children a better chance in another system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at the end of the day, I do not think we have a\r\n\r\nbad education system.  I happen\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  think  that we have a very good one.  But I do  think\r\n\r\nthat  it can be fine-tuned and that the Government should\r\n\r\ntake into account the feedback.  I do not propose to  set\r\n\r\nout  the  whole  list of recommendations for  the  simple\r\n\r\nreason  that the Remaking Singapore Committee is  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of doing this.  All I ask is that the Government\r\n\r\ndo   very   seriously  consider  the  feedback  and   the\r\n\r\nsuggestions  on  education policy that  will  be  in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee's  Report  because a lot of  profile  has  been\r\n\r\ngenerated  by  the Remaking Singapore  Committee.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of that, expectations have been raised.  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  if  there is a genuine response to the  suggestions\r\n\r\nand  recommendations,  people,  especially  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nwill feel that their wants and aspirations are taken into\r\n\r\naccount,  that there is a direct response  and  that  the\r\n\r\nfeeling  of  connection  between  Singaporeans  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will be much closer as a result.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  be  exempted at this day's sitting  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>STAYERS AND QUITTERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

I may\r\n\r\nbe  regarded  as  a \"quitter\" from my country  of  birth,\r\n\r\nwhich  is Malaysia.  I worked in Singapore for more  than\r\n\r\n12 years before I became a citizen.  During that time,  I\r\n\r\nhad many occasions to reflect on whether I should quit my\r\n\r\ncountry  of birth for good.  It was a difficult  decision\r\n\r\nwhen  the  time  came.  The catalyst surprisingly  was  a\r\n\r\nfellow academic from abroad.  On my way to see him off at\r\n\r\nthe Airport, he made a remark\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  has  stayed  with me to this  day.   While  passing\r\n\r\nbuildings   and  parks  along  East  Coast  Parkway,   on\r\n\r\nreturning  from  a trip abroad, he asked me,  \"Don't  you\r\n\r\njust  feel wonderful and happy setting foot again in your\r\n\r\nown  country?\"  At that time, he did not know that I  was\r\n\r\nstill  not  Singaporean.  I remember being influenced  by\r\n\r\nthis  remark and to assess what it is that would make  me\r\n\r\ntake Singapore as a country where I would stay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the major reasons were more or less\r\n\r\nthe  same  as  they  are now.  One, clean  and  efficient\r\n\r\nGovernment.    Two,   good  job  opportunities.    Three,\r\n\r\nmeritocracy.   Four, fair treatment  to  all,  no  matter\r\n\r\nwhether you come from abroad or is local.  Five,  a  good\r\n\r\nplace  to bring up a family.  And, six, a future that  is\r\n\r\npromised   by  an  efficient  Government  and  farsighted\r\n\r\nGovernment.   I think priorities may have changed  a  bit\r\n\r\nsince  that time, which was about 20-odd years ago.   But\r\n\r\nhaving  said that, it pains me when there are  those  who\r\n\r\nare  born here and have had all the benefits, such  as  a\r\n\r\nfirst-class  economy  can give  them,  have  very  little\r\n\r\nfeelings for Singapore, are not proud of the nation, take\r\n\r\nthe  view that if anything happens, they would leave.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that, as the Prime Minister has mentioned,  this\r\n\r\nis a very small group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, like the speaker before me, Ms Indranee Rajah,\r\n\r\nI like to think that the group of Singaporeans that wants\r\n\r\nto   forge  new  lives  elsewhere,  in  another  country,\r\n\r\ndeserves some recognition, not as quitters, but very much\r\n\r\nlike   the   forefathers  before  them  -   self-reliant,\r\n\r\nadventurous, brave Singaporeans.  They are not  quitters,\r\n\r\nexcept in the very basic sense of going abroad to earn  a\r\n\r\nliving.    Why   would   they  do   that?    Many   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, third generation Singaporeans, have told me\r\n\r\nthat  they feel the best years have gone past them,  that\r\n\r\nit  was  the  generation before that benefited  from  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  in Singapore.  Many find it difficult to  compete\r\n\r\nfor the limited resources and opportunities available  in\r\n\r\nSingapore now.  To them, the mountain of success  is  too\r\n\r\nhigh to climb.  It has become an Everest.  They feel that\r\n\r\nthey  should  venture out, climb lower  hills,  get  some\r\n\r\nexpertise, get\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsomething  that will stand them in good stead  when  they\r\n\r\ncome  back to Singapore to compete.  I think these people\r\n\r\nare  strong  Singaporeans.  They are not relying  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  They are brave enough to strike out on their\r\n\r\nown and they face up to the practicalities of life.  They\r\n\r\nare not quitters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is paradoxical that while we are successful\r\n\r\nin  wooing talent from abroad, we have this deep  concern\r\n\r\nabout  keeping  our home-grown talent.   Surely,  we  can\r\n\r\nbuild,  in  the  Prime  Minister's words,  \"a  culturally\r\n\r\nvibrant  city,  capable of attracting the  highly  mobile\r\n\r\ncreative people from abroad.\"  Should that not also  keep\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in Singapore?  Why is it that while we  have\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  attract  so much foreign  talent,  including\r\n\r\ntalent  from  the  First World,  to  put  down  roots  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we are now worried that our home-grown  talent\r\n\r\nmay uproot and go elsewhere?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I talk to young Singaporeans and ask them\r\n\r\nwhat is it they want to have this sense of belonging, the\r\n\r\nanswers  are surprisingly simple and have been  mentioned\r\n\r\nmany  times  before  but perhaps bear  mentioning  again.\r\n\r\nFirst  of all, instead of looking at the subject, like  I\r\n\r\ndid  when  I  first came, which is clean  Government  and\r\n\r\nefficient and meritocracy, many of them said they want  a\r\n\r\npolitical   system  that  allows  for  more   alternative\r\n\r\nrepresentation  and  views.   There  seems  to  be   some\r\n\r\ninexplicable,  and this I cannot explain it,  disapproval\r\n\r\nof  the dominance of one party politics, despite all  the\r\n\r\ngood  that  the governing party has done for the  country\r\n\r\nand for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, they want a freer society, more tolerant of\r\n\r\nalternative   lifestyles  and   attitudes.    Though   we\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  in a small country where  it  is  multi-racial and multi-religious, there must be constraints  to\r\n\r\npreserve  public  order, they want less interference,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as their own actions are concerned, in what they do,\r\n\r\nwhat they read and what they watch - in other words, less\r\n\r\nregulation, less censorship, more privacy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, they mention the cost of living, particularly\r\n\r\nfor those with young families.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  increasing  medical  and other  costs  have  weighed\r\n\r\nheavily on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tied to this is the fourth element, ie, a good job.\r\n\r\nTo  them, getting the right job is very important.   They\r\n\r\nhave this feeling that they have been ignored because  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  message  that  we  must  attract  more\r\n\r\nforeign  talent to Singapore.  They see their promotional\r\n\r\nchances  as  adversely affected by  this  importation  of\r\n\r\nforeign  talent.  I am sure that many of  my  fellow  MPs\r\n\r\nwould   give  all  sorts  of  suggestions  on  what   the\r\n\r\nGovernment should do in order to raise national  identity\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  But, to me, I would like to just  make  one\r\n\r\nproposal,  ie,  that the Government look at  the  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich  they can lay off certain matters, leave it to  the\r\n\r\nindividual choices of people to do, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nsocial   field,   and  try  to  cater   for   alternative\r\n\r\nlifestyles.   One group in particular has mentioned  that\r\n\r\nthe  reason why they want to leave is because they do not\r\n\r\nseem  to  be given the same chances.  And these  are  the\r\n\r\nsingles.   They have found it very difficult  to  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom the family-oriented policies in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new world. We have to realise that\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as a global city competing with other  global\r\n\r\ncities  for  the  same talent, must cope  with  different\r\n\r\nlifestyles, different peoples and different expectations.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  tall  order.  But I hope that  we  can  be  as\r\n\r\nsuccessful as we were in the past, attracting people from\r\n\r\nabroad  as well as providing for the people at home.   At\r\n\r\nthe  end of it, it may just be a question of dollars  and\r\n\r\ncents,  getting the right job and making  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nfamily is well provided for.  But more than that.  When I\r\n\r\nfirst   came,   I   said   a   clean   Government,   good\r\n\r\nopportunities, fair treatment are key.  Now, they seem to\r\n\r\nthink,  no, not enough.  We must have a political  system\r\n\r\nthat  reflects widespread views, alternative views.  This\r\n\r\nis a sign of the changing times.  Are we mature enough to\r\n\r\naccept that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for giving\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nme  the  opportunity to join in this debate.  I  rise  in\r\n\r\nsupport of the motion standing before the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about the labels \"stayers\" and\r\n\r\n\"quitters\" over the last month or so since Prime Minister\r\n\r\nGoh  Chok  Tong's National Day Rally.  This  is  not  the\r\n\r\nfirst time that Singaporeans have reacted to such labels.\r\n\r\nA  couple  of years ago, we hear Singaporeans reacted  to\r\n\r\nthe labels \"cosmopolitans\" and \"heartlanders\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever labels are used, there are fundamental\r\n\r\nissues that Singapore and Singaporeans must address.  One\r\n\r\nkey  issue  is survival, and related to it is  the  issue\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans are needed for Singapore  to  survive.\r\n\r\nThis  issue of survival has been at the core of Singapore\r\n\r\nsociety  since  we  gained  independence.   However,  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  and meanings given to the word differ  as  we\r\n\r\nlook at the stages of development and who is defining the\r\n\r\nterm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to the first-generation Singaporeans, survival\r\n\r\nwas critical during the early Singapore years - the post-war  and pre-independence years.  The struggle to  create\r\n\r\nan  independent  Singapore amidst  severe  political  and\r\n\r\neconomic   uncertainties  made  them  stick  behind   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and accept its policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second generation continued this sense of\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  the  nation, understanding  the  need  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to survive and to build wealth.  The pursuit  of\r\n\r\neconomic development was the sole objective, and everyone\r\n\r\nembraced  such a philosophy.  Policies were accepted  and\r\n\r\neconomic  progress was the visible outcome.  Intermittent\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis  set  in,  but the  previous  experience\r\n\r\nshowed  that the Government knows best and the generation\r\n\r\nfollowed what was prescribed by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third-generation Singaporeans, however, seem to\r\n\r\ndefine   and   give   meaning  to  the  term   \"survival\"\r\n\r\ndifferently.  It is naturally difficult for a  generation\r\n\r\nborn  in  times of economic boom and raised  in  relative\r\n\r\nwealth and comfort to be told\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  they need to think of their survival.  This is  the\r\n\r\nIRC  (Internet Relay Chat), ICQ generation who spend most\r\n\r\nof their time in cyberspace, networking and finding their\r\n\r\nown space, identity and sense of individuality.  The self\r\n\r\nis  emerging  as  the central focus for  this  generation\r\n\r\ncompared to the \"other\".  This seems to be a change  from\r\n\r\nwhat   sociologists  and  psychologists  know  of   Asian\r\n\r\nsocieties - where the \"other\" is more important than  the\r\n\r\n\"self\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a lecturer in the university, I meet the\r\n\r\nthird-generation  Singaporeans every  day.   It  was  not\r\n\r\nsurprising  when I asked them for comments on the  motion\r\n\r\nand  how  the third-generation Singaporeans see it.   The\r\n\r\nresponse was \"What is the point?  The Government  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do  anything anyway.\"  They seem to  say  that\r\n\r\ntheir  voices  will not be heard.  Of course,  with  much\r\n\r\npersuasion, some spoke.  In the course of this speech,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to share with you the voices  of  the  third\r\n\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is clear to them is that they are the\r\n\r\nproduct   of   the  policies  that  the  Government   has\r\n\r\nimplemented.  They do not blame the system nor  are  they\r\n\r\navoiding   to  take  the  responsibility.    The   highly\r\n\r\ncompetitive  educational system has been  highlighted  as\r\n\r\nbeing  responsible  for their sense of  self-centredness.\r\n\r\nTime  and  again, children are reminded by parents  about\r\n\r\nthe importance of education in securing well-paying jobs.\r\n\r\nOne of my students shared and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Our life scope seems to be narrow and mainly\r\n\r\ncentres  around school and achievement.  The pressure  is\r\n\r\nat   times  -  and  \"at  times\"  would  actually  be   an\r\n\r\nunderstatement  -  unmanageable, and  often  the  fun  is\r\n\r\nmissing  from  the learning equation.  Learning  is  seen\r\n\r\nmore as a means to an end - study hard to get a good high-paying  job.   There is no real opportunity  to  exercise\r\n\r\ncreativity  and  broaden  our horizons  as  the  teaching\r\n\r\nschedule is often very tight.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exposed to such a harsh, unrelenting, cut-throat\r\n\r\ncompetitive environment for the most part of  our  lives,\r\n\r\nsome  of  us shudder when we think of the future  working\r\n\r\nenvironment.   Surely, it cannot get  any  better!   What\r\n\r\nwith    the    Government's    emphasis    on    economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  and being the first in everything,  most\r\n\r\nof  us cannot envision a more relaxed or even sympathetic\r\n\r\nenvironment.  There seems to be no end to our  hard  work\r\n\r\nand  we may never be able to run away from the pressures;\r\n\r\nnot  even after slogging 20 years of our lives to finally\r\n\r\nrelax and reap the benefits of our education.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked about their future in Singapore, another\r\n\r\nstudent shared that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The future seems to be stressed to our generation\r\n\r\nas one based on personal merit, capability and hard work,\r\n\r\nwhere  work and economic competitiveness is primary,  and\r\n\r\nbeing  burnt-out at some point is a necessary outcome  of\r\n\r\nour  country's pace.  Perhaps, many people 'quit' because\r\n\r\nthey  are disillusioned by the pace of this society,  and\r\n\r\nare unable or frustrated to keep up with it.  To them, to\r\n\r\n'quit' from this society would help in 'staying' on track\r\n\r\nwith  life, as they are able to better manage their lives\r\n\r\nand stress levels and self-actualise perhaps elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am hearing from these young Singaporeans\r\n\r\nis  that  they need a different environment.   These  are\r\n\r\nstudents  who are currently in the university.  They  are\r\n\r\nthe cream of the crop.  They are those who have succeeded\r\n\r\nacademically.   Yet, they are the ones  who  are  voicing\r\n\r\ntheir   displeasure  at  the  system   that   they   have\r\n\r\nexperienced.  I cannot imagine the voices of those who do\r\n\r\nnot make it to the university, those who have dropped off\r\n\r\nhalf way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These youngsters do not seem to identify with the\r\n\r\nearlier  emphasis  on  success defined  by  academic  and\r\n\r\neconomic achievements.  They seem to want to move  beyond\r\n\r\nthat.   While  they  do  recognise  that  these  are  the\r\n\r\nprinciples that were critical for our nation's  survival,\r\n\r\nthey  want  a different societal ethic.  They  understand\r\n\r\nthat Singapore needs the human capital and drive in order\r\n\r\nto  survive in the world's economy.  Yet, they argue that\r\n\r\nin  this  new age, where life is a lot more complex,  and\r\n\r\nyouths  are  presented  with  a  lot  more  choices   and\r\n\r\ninformation,  this  same  rule of  enterprise  cannot  be\r\n\r\npresented  to  them like a doctrine, ie,  work  hard  and\r\n\r\nstudy  hard because it is good for you and good  for  the\r\n\r\ncountry's  economy.   Many of today's  youths  know  that\r\n\r\nthere   are  certain  things  that  cannot  be   measured\r\n\r\neconomically in dollars and cents, and that they are more\r\n\r\nthan  simply  the sum of their education.  But  they  are\r\n\r\noften not heard, especially those youths who choose paths\r\n\r\nalternative   to   the  mainstream,   due   to   personal\r\n\r\npreferences  or limitation.  Very often,  they  are  only\r\n\r\nexpected to believe in what the authority says.  How  can\r\n\r\nthey feel any sense of belonging to the country when they\r\n\r\nare so detached from the very issues that address them?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another student shared his thoughts on such\r\n\r\nalternative paths like the arts:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"What is saddening is that all this talk about the\r\n\r\narts  and cultural vibrancy is not seen by the Government\r\n\r\nas an end in itself, but rather as a means to the ends of\r\n\r\neconomic  growth.  Thus, the arts is not valued  for  its\r\n\r\ncontribution to the 'human condition' but rather is  used\r\n\r\nto generate creativity for economic purposes.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think what the third-generation Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  clearly  saying  is that their  survival  is  beyond\r\n\r\neconomics  and education.  It is more on their  sense  of\r\n\r\nself  and  well-being.  They are calling out for  a  more\r\n\r\nrelaxed  environment.  They want  to  do  well  in  other\r\n\r\nthings - not necessarily excel in these activities - just\r\n\r\ndo  well and be happy.  Maybe, what they are saying is to\r\n\r\nstop judging success narrowly, perhaps not even to define\r\n\r\nsuccess  and leave success to the individuals to  define.\r\n\r\nThis will also allow us to move away from the tendency to\r\n\r\nclassify  people into neat categories like  quitters  and\r\n\r\nstayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was away from Singapore in the mid-90s for\r\n\r\nseveral years.  When I returned, I saw a new Singapore  - a  Singapore  that was going through a process  of  self-reflection.  It was indicative of the realisation on  the\r\n\r\npart of the Government that third-generation Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  not  identifying with values and principles  of  the\r\n\r\nearlier generation, that they may need a different set of\r\n\r\nvalues, expanding the economic and academic definition of\r\n\r\nsuccess.   The  S21  initiative was  well  conceived  and\r\n\r\nreceived   by   Singaporeans.   It  prides  itself   with\r\n\r\ngathering feedback from more than 6,000 Singaporeans.  As\r\n\r\na  result,  five  tenets  were  conceptualised.   We  now\r\n\r\nattempt  to  encourage  Singaporeans  to  embrace   these\r\n\r\ntenets.   But  I am not sure how many Singaporeans  still\r\n\r\nremember  them.   It  was  supposed  to  be  the   social\r\n\r\nblueprint  for  the Singapore society.  It addressed  the\r\n\r\nissues  raised  by  third-generation  Singaporeans  also.\r\n\r\nYet,  we  are  still  hearing  the  rumblings  from  this\r\n\r\ngeneration that we want to reach out to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Government formed the Remaking\r\n\r\nSingapore Committee, which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npromised  to leave no stone unturned.  Every policy  will\r\n\r\nbe  scrutinised and analysed.  My only hope  is  for  the\r\n\r\ncommittee  to  ensure that any change in policy  be  done\r\n\r\nwith  a  systemic orientation, noting how one policy  may\r\n\r\naffect  the  other.   I  do  not  want  to  pre-empt  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the committee as I am sure this  House\r\n\r\nwill have the opportunity to debate them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Remaking Singapore Committee is an\r\n\r\nencouraging   process   of   self-reflection    on    the\r\n\r\nGovernment's part, I think we also need to reflect on the\r\n\r\nrelationship that the third-generation Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\nwith the Government.  The first and the second-generation\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  established a relationship by  choice  when\r\n\r\nthey  decided to migrate here.  It is like a marriage  by\r\n\r\nchoice.  But, Sir, unlike the first and second-generation\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, the third-generation Singaporeans are  born\r\n\r\ninto   the   relationship  with  the  country   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   For the third generation,  it  is  like  an\r\n\r\narranged marriage or a marriage of convenience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it takes two to tango. It takes two to make a\r\n\r\nmarriage work.  Couples quit marriages after they realise\r\n\r\nthat  they cannot tango together anymore.  They  are  not\r\n\r\nable to synchronise their steps any longer.  They step on\r\n\r\neach  other's toes ever so often.  They were not able  to\r\n\r\nmeet  each  other's expectations.  Common  problems  they\r\n\r\nface include: they cannot communicate to each other, they\r\n\r\ndo  not listen to one another, they do not share a common\r\n\r\nvision, they do not see eye-to-eye.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before our third-generation Singaporeans quit\r\n\r\non the country, perhaps we need to understand their needs\r\n\r\nand  expectations  and facilitate their understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe  country's needs and expectations.  Let us make  this\r\n\r\nmarriage work.  Do we communicate with each other?   Some\r\n\r\nsay  yes,  some  say no.  This is common in relationships\r\n\r\nthat  are  turning sour.  Communication  theorists  argue\r\n\r\nthat  \"we cannot not communicate\".  The Government  needs\r\n\r\nto    recognise    the   non-verbal   communication    of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  There have been suggestions that the lack\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof enthusiasm in putting out the state flag outside their\r\n\r\nflats   was   indication   of  Singaporeans'   sense   of\r\n\r\nunhappiness  in the recent National Day.   While  we  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to read non-verbal messages, we need to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans are made to feel that they  are  being\r\n\r\nlistened to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have different mechanisms for feedback but the\r\n\r\ncommon grouse is that this feedback is seldom taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration.  Many Singaporeans, however,  hold  on  to\r\n\r\nthe  view  that  feedback is listened to and  taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration only when it is acted upon, ie, if there is\r\n\r\nno  action  from Government, it means that they  are  not\r\n\r\nlistening.   The transport fare hike is a  good  example,\r\n\r\nthough I am sure that there are many other examples prior\r\n\r\nto  this.  Whatever the explanation, Singaporeans need to\r\n\r\nbe  assured  that  the decisions made  have  taken  their\r\n\r\nconcerns into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third generation Singaporeans are more\r\n\r\ndiscerning.  They  need  to be  convinced  with  rational\r\n\r\narguments  supported by relevant facts  and  information.\r\n\r\nIn  this  regard, Sir, I think more can be  done  to  get\r\n\r\nthird  generation Singaporeans to understand the workings\r\n\r\nof  this  Government sector, how policies are  formulated\r\n\r\nand  implemented, how they respond to public queries  and\r\n\r\nhow they react to new trends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to recommend that the Government\r\n\r\ninclude,  as part of the school curriculum, at  least  at\r\n\r\npost-secondary level, since the bulk of our cohort  would\r\n\r\nhave   reached  that  level,  an  industrial   attachment\r\n\r\nprogramme  with  Government agencies and  Ministries.   I\r\n\r\nthink  such  a programme is limited only to  scholars  at\r\n\r\nthis  time.   Such a programme would go  a  long  way  in\r\n\r\ngiving  young  Singaporeans a glimpse into the  world  of\r\n\r\ncivil  service  and  governance.  We  have  an  extensive\r\n\r\nprogramme of industrial attachments in the private sector\r\n\r\nto  expose students to the real working world.  It may be\r\n\r\ntimely  to  expose  Singaporeans  to  the  world  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   This  would  facilitate  understanding  and\r\n\r\nappreciation  of  policy formulation and  implementation.\r\n\r\nIt  will  strengthen the foundation of  the  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween Government and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthird generation Singaporeans.  Perhaps it will make them\r\n\r\nstay in the marriage longer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House is the highest policy-making body in\r\n\r\nthe   country.   It  is  sad,  however,  that  not   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are aware of what happens  in  this  House.\r\n\r\nThe  media  reports what it deems as important  and  that\r\n\r\nshapes  what  Singaporeans think of  the  House  and  its\r\n\r\nprocesses.  Apart from a few pages in the print media, we\r\n\r\nget  15  minutes of airtime over television  (maximum  30\r\n\r\nminutes).   Of  course,  we  do  see  the  reason  -  its\r\n\r\ncommercial viability or a lack of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also guilty of it. Prior to being a Member of\r\n\r\nthe  House, my perception is solely guided by what I read\r\n\r\nin  the papers and watch on television.  I do now realise\r\n\r\nthat  there is much more that happens in this House.   To\r\n\r\nappreciate the works of the Government, Singaporeans need\r\n\r\nto  be  exposed to such important processes  as  much  as\r\n\r\npossible.   I  am  glad  to notice many  school  students\r\n\r\ncoming to the House to hear what is happening.  It  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  start.  However, we need to explore other  ways  of\r\n\r\nproviding Singaporeans with the opportunity to appreciate\r\n\r\nwhat  goes on in the House.  Perhaps a television channel\r\n\r\nakin  to  CSPAN  in the US where the proceedings  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  of  Representatives and the Senate  are  televised\r\n\r\nlive  may be considered.  Yes, cost is an issue, economic\r\n\r\nviability  is  the  essence, but if  we  hear  the  third\r\n\r\ngeneration's voice, let us think out of the box  and  see\r\n\r\nif  we  can  indeed make this work.  Let us look  at  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  that  we  can reap - more informed  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nappreciating  the works of the Government.   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nneed  to feel they belong, they need to own the processes\r\n\r\nthat  take place in the country, and I do believe  it  is\r\n\r\ncritical for them to own the processes that take place in\r\n\r\nthis House too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge MITA to seriously study this possibility.\r\n\r\nYes, the argument is that:  will Singaporeans tune in  to\r\n\r\nit  even  when  it is provided for?  We certainly  cannot\r\n\r\nforce them to do so, but we can facilitate and start with\r\n\r\nthe  schools  tuning  on to it.  We can  explore  delayed\r\n\r\ntelecast over\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndesignated channels. The point is, Singaporeans  need  to\r\n\r\nown  the  processes  - they need to be  partners  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for them to belong and want to  stay  in  the\r\n\r\npartnership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we are now going through\r\n\r\nthe  process of self-reflection, let us seriously reflect\r\n\r\non  our  relationship with the people.  We have to  start\r\n\r\ntaking  dance lessons seriously so that we can  tango  to\r\n\r\nthe heartbeat of the third generation and synchronise our\r\n\r\nfootsteps to their tempo.  Let us make the marriage  work\r\n\r\n- till death do us part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the main points in my speech\r\n\r\ntoday  will be:  (1) to provide a stage for the non-elite\r\n\r\nin our society; (2) to inject into the spiritual thinking\r\n\r\nof  all  our  people  a sense of belonging;  and  (3)  to\r\n\r\ncultivate a third generation of Singaporeans whose hearts\r\n\r\nare attached to their motherland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this famous poem in Chinese that goes as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The river flows 3,000 miles away,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family letter comprises 15 lines,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing expressed in each of the lines,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the message, Please come home early!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I accompanied the Speaker of Parliament on\r\n\r\na  visit to Mexico.  During the visit, I enjoyed the feel\r\n\r\nof  the  Mexican culture and the richness of its history.\r\n\r\nYet, at the same time, I missed my family, my parents, my\r\n\r\nwife,  my  siblings,  my  children,  my  friends  and  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the important factors that make the people\r\n\r\nfeel for the place where they were born and grown are the\r\n\r\nland and the people.  However, under the present trend of\r\n\r\nglobalisation, many countries are developing rapidly, and\r\n\r\nworking towards building up the most advanced and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattractive  urban outlook by imitating one another.  Very\r\n\r\noften,  we  find  that many countries are looking  alike,\r\n\r\nexcept  perhaps  the weather and the climate.  Sometimes,\r\n\r\nyou  go  to  a foreign country and it looks so much  like\r\n\r\nhome that you doubt whether you have left home!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the past, it was difficult for\r\n\r\npeople  to  go out of the country.  Most of the  time,  a\r\n\r\nperson  would  venture abroad alone to earn  a  living  - leaving  his  family,  his loved  ones  behind.  Whenever\r\n\r\npossible,  he would work very hard, save every  cent  and\r\n\r\nsend all his earnings home.  Now, it is different.  Given\r\n\r\na  chance, those who have the talents and the means would\r\n\r\nnot hesitate to take along all their loved ones and their\r\n\r\nbelongings to the greener pastures overseas, and  leaving\r\n\r\nnothing  behind.  It is therefore more difficult nowadays\r\n\r\nfor  these  people  to retain their  feelings  for  their\r\n\r\nmotherland,  at  least  their feeling  would  not  be  as\r\n\r\nprofound as the people in the good old days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we retain these elites in our country who are\r\n\r\nblessed  with an abundance of opportunities all over  the\r\n\r\nworld and, at the same time, let the non-elite understand\r\n\r\nthat  although we are constantly striving for excellence,\r\n\r\nwith  the hope of becoming the global or regional  centre\r\n\r\nof this and that, we need to attract elites from all over\r\n\r\nthe  world  to help us accomplish these goals,  we  still\r\n\r\nneed  the strength of all these non-elites among us?   We\r\n\r\nmust  give  the non-elites the assurance that it  is  our\r\n\r\npolicy  to attract and retain the best talents.  To  this\r\n\r\nend, I have two main suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us talk about how to provide a stage for\r\n\r\nthe non-elites. Recently, there was an award known as the\r\n\r\n\"Phoenix  Award\", aimed at  encouraging entrepreneurs  to\r\n\r\nget  out  of  the shadow of failure.  I read through  the\r\n\r\nrecords  of  the  nominees.  One  of  them,  a  corporate\r\n\r\nmanager,  encountered many failures, two  of  which  were\r\n\r\nparticularly  serious.  On one occasion, he  met  with  a\r\n\r\nserious flood and, on the other he bred a species of fish\r\n\r\nfrom Sichuan and suffered heavy losses.  He deserves  the\r\n\r\naward. How many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have the opportunity of encountering so many\r\n\r\nrounds of failures, yet stand firm enough to be nominated\r\n\r\nfor this Phoenix Award?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many non-elites in Singapore. They\r\n\r\ndiligently and faithfully serve our community and country\r\n\r\nin  various capacities, and contribute silently in  their\r\n\r\nown  ways to the nation.  Should we not give them a stage\r\n\r\nor a platform to show our appreciation to them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there are various grassroots\r\n\r\npublications.  However, more often  than  not,  what  are\r\n\r\nfeatured  in  these publications are photographs  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity's  activities  and the  community  leaders  and\r\n\r\nactive  participants.  Can we not designate a  column  to\r\n\r\nfeature Uncle Wang who has been selling breakfast for the\r\n\r\nresidents  in this area for many decades, or  Auntie  Liu\r\n\r\nwho  has been sweeping the floor in the community for the\r\n\r\npast  10 years?  I am sure the children and grandchildren\r\n\r\nof  Uncle  Wang  and Auntie Liu can pass them  down  from\r\n\r\ngeneration  to  generation as a family heirloom.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, such special features in the publication could\r\n\r\nserve  as an encouragement and inspiration to other  non-elites, and let everybody know that we need not only  the\r\n\r\nelites, but we need non-elites too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May this year, a survey conducted on Singapore's\r\n\r\nworkforce  revealed that out of 10 workers,  8  were  not\r\n\r\ncommitted to their work, and one was not  happy with  his\r\n\r\njob.   Has such unhappiness arisen because they felt that\r\n\r\nthey  were \"nobody\" in their company, and their  presence\r\n\r\nor  absence  would  make very little  difference  to  the\r\n\r\ncompany?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I feel that the Government has given much\r\n\r\nthought  to  the  future of our country.  However,  while\r\n\r\nimplementing the various policies and programmes, it  was\r\n\r\noverly  technocratic,  and  too  little  humanities   and\r\n\r\nflexibility.  This has often resulted in the  people  not\r\n\r\nfeeling appreciative of what the Government has done  for\r\n\r\nthem, and a lot of good intentions were not appreciated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. Recently, the Lianhe\r\n\r\nZaobao  published the complaint of one  Mdm  Cheong  Peck\r\n\r\nWan.   Her  husband worked for 25 years  in  a  statutory\r\n\r\nboard  and  was  diagnosed to be  suffering  from  senile\r\n\r\ndementia  at a rather young age.  This had an aggravating\r\n\r\neffect  on the family's finances.  Eventually,  she  went\r\n\r\nand  made a claim under the Dependants' Protection Scheme\r\n\r\n(DPS).  The application was processed very smoothly.  But\r\n\r\nwhen she went to collect the money, she was told that she\r\n\r\nhad to engage a lawyer, at her own expenses, to obtain  a\r\n\r\ncourt order.  Already cash-strapped, how could Mdm Cheong\r\n\r\nafford  the  money  to  engage a lawyer!   This  is  like\r\n\r\nrequiring  a person to have 5 katis of rice in your  rice\r\n\r\nbin  before you can be entitled to your provision of  100\r\n\r\nkatis.  This is not too reasonable.  As such, when we are\r\n\r\ngoing  to implement a good policy, do we not have  to  be\r\n\r\nmore humane and more flexible?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the NTUC Club has plans to invest $25\r\n\r\nmillion to build a \"Big Splash\", and we aim to double our\r\n\r\ntourist  arrivals and tourism revenue by the  year  2012.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we also plan to become a medical hub in\r\n\r\nAsia.  All these plans can definitely help Singapore find\r\n\r\na  way  out  in the globalised economy and be successful.\r\n\r\nHowever,  as we are building a place here for the  global\r\n\r\nelites  to  live comfortably in, are we causing  our  own\r\n\r\npeople  who live here to feel that they are getting  less\r\n\r\nand  less acquainted with their own country, and even not\r\n\r\nknowing how to position themselves in their own country?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about building up the people's sense of\r\n\r\nbelonging.  Singapore recently lost a grandmaster in  the\r\n\r\ntheatre  world, Mr Kuo Pao Kun. An intellectual like  him\r\n\r\nknows very well that living in a spiritually impoverished\r\n\r\ncountry, his chances of further development abroad are no\r\n\r\nsmaller than those of a technocrat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of Singapore lies in the fact that we\r\n\r\nare  always  able to find a way to survive in  a  rapidly\r\n\r\nchanging  economic  market.  But when  we  encounter  the\r\n\r\nproblem of humanities and thinking, that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis,  the so-called   metaphysical planning, we often lack\r\n\r\nthe  patience  to wait, and appear to lack the  skill  to\r\n\r\ntackle the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I would suggest we weave the stories of\r\n\r\nsuch  patriotic intellectuals into our school  curriculum\r\n\r\nand  passing  them  on  from  generation  to  generation.\r\n\r\nCurrently,   there  are  few  essays  on  a   Singaporean\r\n\r\n'ideology' or 'sense of belonging' in language textbooks.\r\n\r\nThis is the right thing for us to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is that the Government has recently\r\n\r\ndeclared  36  big  trees  as  'heritage  trees'   to   be\r\n\r\npreserved.   These   trees  have  not  only   contributed\r\n\r\nsubstantively to our 'garden city' image,  but  are  also\r\n\r\nconstant  reminders of our past.   This is very good.  It\r\n\r\nis an effort to translate the inner thinking into action.\r\n\r\nIn  a fast-changing world, while we seek to be innovative\r\n\r\nand to change, we have not forgotten the preservation  of\r\n\r\nthe  `direct  scene', so that the people living  on  this\r\n\r\nland  will  have  the opportunity to get  in  touch  with\r\n\r\nhistorical sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at what we have in our textbooks now. Is there\r\n\r\nanything  to  tell us why Orchard Road is called  Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad?  How many storeys were there in the earliest 'tall'\r\n\r\nbuildings  in Singapore?  How many times has the  Merlion\r\n\r\nbeen retrofitted? How many times has the musical fountain\r\n\r\nin Sentosa been restructured?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not only to be warm and friendly to the\r\n\r\ntourists  but, more importantly, every citizen should  be\r\n\r\nable to tell some little stories about every little alley\r\n\r\nand  every old tree to the tourists.   Is that not a  way\r\n\r\nof establishing a sense of belonging?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have said that Singapore is a paradise\r\n\r\nfor  the elites.  Look at our Master Plan for the future.\r\n\r\nIt  may  appear that there is some truth in this  saying.\r\n\r\nBut  to  inculcate  a  sense of belonging  in  our  third\r\n\r\ngeneration   Singaporeans,  and  to  have  their   hearts\r\n\r\nattached to our country,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  most  important thing to promote  education  in  the\r\n\r\nsense  of  belonging to the whole nation,  we  must  also\r\n\r\nprovide a stage for the non-elites among us.  Because, if\r\n\r\nanything  is to happen to our country, it is  always  the\r\n\r\npeople  whose assets and life are inseparable  from  this\r\n\r\npiece  of  land  who  would be  the  first  to  bear  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me end my speech with these few lines\r\n\r\nof a poem:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Qin's bright moon hanging over the fortress of Han,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldiers on the long match have yet to return,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the flying generals of Longcheng survive,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let not the Tartan horses pass our mountain\r\n\r\ncrossing.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that every Singaporean will be a\r\n\r\nflying general of Longcheng who loves this piece of  land\r\n\r\nand love our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  it is said that Prime Minister  Goh  Chok\r\n\r\nTong  will  be  retiring  soon.   If  PM  Goh  is  really\r\n\r\nretiring, I think the deepest impression he has left with\r\n\r\nthe people is that he likes to label our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, PM Goh classified Singaporeans as\r\n\r\n\"cosmopolitans\" and \"heartlanders\".  Now,  again,  he  is\r\n\r\nclassifying  Singaporeans  as \"quitters\"  and  \"stayers\".\r\n\r\nThis  is  quite  consistent with the  PAP's   stereotyped\r\n\r\nthinking,  ie,  to  label  the  people  right  from   the\r\n\r\nbeginning   and  then  classify  them,  thereby   causing\r\n\r\nunnecessary  confusion, argument and  even  splitting  of\r\n\r\namong the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are \"quitters\" and who are \"stayers\"? Are those\r\n\r\nwho  have quit  really \"quitters\"?  As for those who have\r\n\r\nnot   quit  or  are  unable  to  quit,  are  they  really\r\n\r\n\"stayers\"?    Then,  of  course,  there  are   also   the\r\n\r\n\"psychological\" immigrantsNot to forget  also  those  who\r\n\r\nemigrated  \"psychologically\" .  That is another story.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such labelling is a very superficial comparison\r\n\r\nbetween the two types of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople.   If  the  Government is doubtful  about  whether\r\n\r\npeople  would  stay to defend their country  when  it  is\r\n\r\nfacing trouble, then I think the most important thing  we\r\n\r\nshould  do  is  that we should to read and interpret  the\r\n\r\nsigns  behind all these movements of the people and  look\r\n\r\nat  the  problem squarely.  If the Government feels  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  not a problem, then they should not be free  to\r\n\r\nlabel the people and classify them the people at liberty.\r\n\r\nI think PM Goh should remember be reminded that saying pa\r\n\r\nsi bo jao in piping times of peace is indeed unrealistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Minister Lee has said disclosed many years\r\n\r\nago  that  one of the purposes of letting the people  own\r\n\r\ntheir  flats  is  that one day when we  are  attacked  by\r\n\r\nothers,  Singaporeans will feel that they have  something\r\n\r\nhere  in  Singapore to worth defending  for.   Yet,  some\r\n\r\ndecades  later, PM Goh is pointing out that  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  using the profits they made from the sale  of  their\r\n\r\nHDB  flats  to buy cheap and big houses in Australia,  to\r\n\r\nprepare  for  emigration.  I think this is  indeedWhat  a\r\n\r\nmockery  to  the  PAP Government.  ! Such contrast  aptly\r\n\r\nshows  how  the people's values have been influenced  and\r\n\r\nchanged  byAfter being ruled by the PAP Government  under\r\n\r\nmaterialisticand,so-called   \"pragmatic\"   and   humanely\r\n\r\nindifferent approachPAP Government , the people's  values\r\n\r\nare  changing within the past four decades of their rule.\r\n\r\nIt  is  said that as a man sows, so he shall reap.   Such\r\n\r\nchanges are not surprising at all.  This is indeed karma.\r\n\r\nNow that the problem is affecting our future development,\r\n\r\na  worried PM Goh has launched a debate among the  people\r\n\r\nto  look into this matter.  This is like mending the fold\r\n\r\nafter  a  sheep is lost, But but then it also  gives  the\r\n\r\npeople   a   chance  to  see  the   so-called  farsighted\r\n\r\nGovernment is indeed very shortsighted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's motion seeks to ask the Government to review\r\n\r\nits various policies so that it will as to strengthen the\r\n\r\npeople's sense of belonging.  I feel thatTo me,  there is\r\n\r\nsomething  more fundamental than the sense of  belonging.\r\n\r\nMencius  has  once said that: \"everyone has a  heart  for\r\n\r\nothers.   So, ifIf the Government has a feeling  for  the\r\n\r\npeople,  then its policies should be formulated with  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the people at heart. When people see a  child\r\n\r\nfalling into a well, the first thing they think of is  to\r\n\r\nfeel sorry for the child and his parents.  They do so not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njust to show favour to his parents, or to make a name for\r\n\r\nthemselves.   It  is just a natural reflection  of  their\r\n\r\ninner feelings.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extending from what Mencius has said, I think\r\n\r\neveryone  should have this inner feeling for  his  ethnic\r\n\r\ngroup,  his own language, his own culture, his  homeland,\r\n\r\nhis  country  and his fellow citizens, and this  is  what\r\n\r\nMencius  has said.  It is a All these feelings  are  very\r\n\r\nnatural feelingand free from materialistic consideration.\r\n\r\nIt  is not because of any other benefits involved.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  are courageous to devote or sacrifice themselves for\r\n\r\ntheir  country, their belief or their idea are absolutely\r\n\r\nnot  driven by materialistic consideration. It is a  kind\r\n\r\nof  spiritual conditionSo I think this is something  that\r\n\r\nis  in  the  human nature and we have to enhance  such  a\r\n\r\nfeeling through education and daily accumulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the late Mr Tan Lark Sye who founded\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang University, the late Professor Pan Shou  who\r\n\r\nhelped  to  set up the Nanyang University and the  famous\r\n\r\nplaywright,  Mr  Kuo Pao Kun, who  recently  just  passed\r\n\r\naway recently.  During their lifetime, they suffered  the\r\n\r\ninhumanity  of  having their citizenship revoked.   Would\r\n\r\nthey not be disappointed with the country?  They had  the\r\n\r\ntalents,  they  had  the  wealth,  and  they  were   well\r\n\r\nqualified  to  migrate  to other  countries.   Yet,  they\r\n\r\nstayed.   Why?  I think it is because they have the  love\r\n\r\nfor  their people around them, for their own language and\r\n\r\nculture, and for their homeland and nation.  And  without\r\n\r\ndoubt,  All  all  these forefathers  of  ours  were  well\r\n\r\neducated  immersed  in the humanities education,  through\r\n\r\nwhich  the  spiritual  condition  was  enhanced  as  what\r\n\r\nMencius had pointed out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we could educate our people. We should\r\n\r\ncultivate  our people so that they know how to think  not\r\n\r\nonly  for  themselves, but also for others  around  them.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  we  even have to go to court  to  compel  the\r\n\r\nchildren  to   maintain  their parents.  This  is  indeed\r\n\r\nregrettable and shameful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at Singapore today. There are some people who\r\n\r\nare quite willing and happy to discard their own language\r\n\r\nand  culture, and they do not without feeling ashamed  at\r\n\r\nall.   Quite  a  handful of people are  migrating  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  their  children dislike  learning  their  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  and  could not even manage to pass  the  relevant\r\n\r\nexaminations  to  qualify for the university.  There  are\r\n\r\nalso those who openly declared\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  pack  and  go  once  the  nation  faces\r\n\r\ndifficulties. Well, We we can criticise these people, but\r\n\r\nthen  we  should also think deeper into why these  people\r\n\r\nare behaving the way they dowhere we have gone wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every person has his own individual character. The\r\n\r\npeople  have their collective character.  The nation  has\r\n\r\nits  national  character.   I think  the  cultivation  of\r\n\r\ncharacter is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is character? Character is fundamental to the\r\n\r\npeople's loyalty, faith, sincerity and righteousness.  At\r\n\r\ntimes  of national disaster, will the people simply  quit\r\n\r\nor  stand  up  for  the nation, it  all  depends  on  the\r\n\r\ncharacter.  Taking  refuge  is  second  nature   to   the\r\n\r\nanimals, but it is not necessarily human nature.  When we\r\n\r\nhave dedication to our nation, to our society and a sense\r\n\r\nof  righteousness, it is something that is inborn in  the\r\n\r\nhuman heart.  Yet, we have to constantly augment it  with\r\n\r\neducation.   The Government should educate and  lead  the\r\n\r\npeople,  so  that  they know how to cultivate  their  own\r\n\r\ncharacter. For this, the Government itself should possess\r\n\r\nsome  kind of character, otherwise it cannot be  expected\r\n\r\nthat  the  people will have its character and the  nation\r\n\r\nthe national character.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look at the PAP Government. What is the\r\n\r\ngoverning  principle for of the PAP Government's  ruling,\r\n\r\nand what have they used as an examplewhat kind of example\r\n\r\nhave   they  set  for  the  people?   Regrettably,    the\r\n\r\npragmatic line of the The  PAP Government which it claims\r\n\r\nhas  been saying that it has helped to created create  an\r\n\r\neconomic  miracle for Singapore and it has run  Singapore\r\n\r\nin  a very pragmatic political line.  In fact, it is  too\r\n\r\nmaterialistic  and  it  is interested  only  in  material\r\n\r\ngains.   It  has neglected humanities and has  tremendous\r\n\r\nrepercussion on the spiritual condition of Singapore.  So\r\n\r\nwhen  PM  Goh mentioned the \"quitters\" mentality,  it  is\r\n\r\nexactly  a  reflection  of  what  went  wrong  with  this\r\n\r\nmaterialistic approach by the PAP Government. Should  the\r\n\r\nPAP Government do a self-reflection itself or just accuse\r\n\r\nthe people sternly?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us look at the PAP's example of political\r\n\r\ncoercion and material inducement.  The PAP Government has\r\n\r\nbeen\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nusing  all  sorts  of  material  benefits,  such  as  HDB\r\n\r\nupgrading programme, distribution of `ang pow',  etc,  to\r\n\r\ninduce the people to vote for them.  The people are being\r\n\r\nconditioned   in  such  a  way  that  they  become   very\r\n\r\nmaterialistic.  They will react only if there are goodies\r\n\r\nin  the  bag  for them. If there is no benefit  attached,\r\n\r\nthey  would  not  even lift a finger.   So,  why  are  we\r\n\r\nblaming them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think tThe feeling for the nation is evolved and\r\n\r\nextended from the feeling for others, for the family  and\r\n\r\nfor  the  community,  through daily  accumulation.  is  a\r\n\r\nvirtue  which  can  be  augmented through  education  and\r\n\r\nexperience in life.  However, for their own benefit,  the\r\n\r\nPAP  Government has done a lot of things  for  their  own\r\n\r\nbenefit.    Take  the  has  re-delineated  ion   of   the\r\n\r\nconstituency  boundaries freely.   Braddell  Heights  can\r\n\r\nsuddenly  become  part of Marine Parade  and,  overnight,\r\n\r\nCheng  San  Constituency can become a  name  in  history.\r\n\r\nThese  illogical  things  are done  just  to  suit  their\r\n\r\ninterest.In  this way, how can you expect the  people  to\r\n\r\nbuild  the  community  spirit  ,  which  is  a  necessary\r\n\r\nintermediate  step  in  extending one's  feeling  to  the\r\n\r\nnation.  What kind of leading by example are  we  talking\r\n\r\nabout?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another aspect, the PAP Government has been using\r\n\r\nthe   fear   tactics  on  the  people.   At   its   first\r\n\r\nanniversary,  the Speakers' Corner was so deserted.   Are\r\n\r\nthe people so happy with life in Singapore that they have\r\n\r\nno  complaints and have nothing to say?   No.   They  are\r\n\r\njust  afraid that by speaking there, the Government  will\r\n\r\ntake  action  against them later, and they just  want  to\r\n\r\nplay  safe  by  keeping quiet, and  not  doing  something\r\n\r\nanything  that will jeopardise  their stay in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nEven  this  can be a false perception, the PAP Government\r\n\r\nis happy to let thing be as it helps to keep their power.\r\n\r\nBut  how do we expect our people to fight fearlessly  for\r\n\r\nthe  country  if  they  are living under  such  fear  and\r\n\r\ndeveloped into a timid mentality against strong power?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SoFurthermore, because of all thisPAP's dominance,\r\n\r\nno  one is willing to come forward to participate in  the\r\n\r\ngoverning of Singapore.  They just want to remain in  the\r\n\r\ncomfort zone, stay cosy and be happy in their own private\r\n\r\nlives  as  long  as the Government continues  to  provide\r\n\r\nmeans  for  such  an  end.  So, this  GovernmentThis  has\r\n\r\nevolved into what we may call a \"moderate autocracy\", and\r\n\r\nshed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naway  the  past  image of a tyranny.  The Government  now\r\n\r\ntakes  a  moderate  and  fatherly  approach.    It  make-believes  that it is democratic, and it conducts  regular\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections.   But, the fact is,  it  is  actually\r\n\r\nruling Singapore with a great supervisory power over  the\r\n\r\npeople.    Simultaneously,  the  self-interest  mentality\r\n\r\nleads  to  weaker  public sphere.   And  Eventually,  the\r\n\r\npeople  feel so helpless against such bureaucrats, become\r\n\r\nalienated, and this has caused run into a vicious  cycle,\r\n\r\nand many are  quitting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, the PAP Government has always been\r\n\r\nconsidering their own benefits first.  The result is that\r\n\r\nthe  people will also fend for themselves.  They want  to\r\n\r\nlook  after  their own interest.  Mencius said,  \"If  the\r\n\r\nEmperor says what is good for me to retain my power,  and\r\n\r\nthe  officials  say  what can I do to benefit  my  feudal\r\n\r\nstate,  and  the  people say what can  I  do  to  benefit\r\n\r\nmyself,  then  everyone looks after their  own  interest,\r\n\r\nthey  become egoistic.  The nation cannot prosperwill  be\r\n\r\nat risk.\" This is exactly what the PAP is doing!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, look at how the PAP Government has been\r\n\r\ntreating  the people.  When the economy is  bad  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  are  having  a hard time making  ends  meet,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment says that we must sacrifice, take a  CPF  cut,\r\n\r\nsuffer  a  wage  freeze, in order that  the  economy  can\r\n\r\nrecover.   On  the  other  hand, the  Government  is  not\r\n\r\ngrateful  to  all these sacrifices made  by  the  people.\r\n\r\nDuring  these  bad times, they increase public  transport\r\n\r\nfares,  increase healthcare charges, etc.  The Government\r\n\r\nsays, \"Well, the increase is only marginal.  Everyone can\r\n\r\nafford  it.  Do not be emotional about it.\"  By the  same\r\n\r\nlogic,  if  we are being attacked by our enemy,  can  our\r\n\r\nNSmen  ask  the Government to pump in more funds  to  buy\r\n\r\nmore  sophisticated weaponspay them a small sum in return\r\n\r\nfor  fighting for the nation, just because the Government\r\n\r\ncan  well afford it?  Will the Government do it, as  this\r\n\r\nis  logically  sound  based on the  above  PAP  argument?\r\n\r\nWon't  the  people be alienated by such a \"rational\"  but\r\n\r\nindeed calculative mentality? Sure, they will.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst thing is that In in our present situation\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is a one-party rule dominance by  the  PAP,\r\n\r\nwhen the people are having so muchhave\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbad feelings against the Government, so much so that they\r\n\r\ntransfer this bad feeling to Singapore as a nation. there\r\n\r\nThere were comments that the significantly reduced number\r\n\r\nof  flags displayed by the residents throughout Singapore\r\n\r\nduring the recent National Day month was a reflection  of\r\n\r\ntheir dissatisfaction with the PAP Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this \"quitting\" mentality is not something\r\n\r\nthat  is  generated  overnight.  It  is  a  result  of  a\r\n\r\naccumulation of discontentcontinuous erosion  of  natural\r\n\r\nfeeling  towards others, ignorance of humanity  education\r\n\r\nand alienation caused by various policies over the years.\r\n\r\nThe  biggest  danger  is  that  Because  because  of  the\r\n\r\ninconsiderate  measures adopted by the  Government,  many\r\n\r\npeople   are  \"quitters\"  subconsciously  and  once   the\r\n\r\nopportunity for emigration emerges, they will pack and go\r\n\r\nwithout  second thought. leaving because they  could  not\r\n\r\ntake it any more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's motion seeks to urge the Government to\r\n\r\nreview  its  policy  and to enhance the  third-generation\r\n\r\nSingaporeans'  sense  of belonging  for  Singapore.   But\r\n\r\nthese third-generation Singaporeans are brought upmoulded\r\n\r\nby  under  anthe  same  education  system  which  is  led\r\n\r\nmastered  by the PAP Government.  Many of them felt  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  global  citizens, they do  not  owe  Singapore\r\n\r\nanything.   They  have no moral obligation  to  stay  and\r\n\r\nserve  Singapore.   So, if the grass is  greener  in  the\r\n\r\nother courtyard, why should I stay here, and sacrifice my\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  enjoy  the greener  pastures  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThat  is why there are more people leaving Singapore.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  to modify those  policies  that  are\r\n\r\nbeneficial to the nation such as the mother tongue policy\r\n\r\nto  suit these quitters in order to  retain them,  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  open the Pandora's box and more quitters  will\r\n\r\nemerge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our best students, the scholarship holders\r\n\r\nbreak  their  bonds, the PAP Government accused  them  of\r\n\r\nbeing   irresponsible.   Apart  from  the  penalty,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment publicised  their names to shame them.  By the\r\n\r\nsame  logic, will the Government also consider publishing\r\n\r\nthe names of the quitters and shame them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think advise the PAP Government should not to be\r\n\r\nharsh in reprimanding the people but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlenient to itself.  When we want to remake Singapore, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should also have the courage to  admit  their\r\n\r\nmistakes  and to give up all this materialistic  approach\r\n\r\nin   governing,  establish  its  character,  reform   the\r\n\r\neducation  system,  strengthen  the  humanity  education,\r\n\r\nenhance  the  people's  natural  feeling  towards   their\r\n\r\nhomeland, and share the feeling of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how prosperous and wealthy a country is,\r\n\r\nif  the  people  have  no sense of  belonging  for  their\r\n\r\ncountry, lack the will and determination to defend  their\r\n\r\ncountry  and  lack  the spirit the  Government  fails  to\r\n\r\nfoster  the  national  spirit during of  nation-building,\r\n\r\nthen this country is fundamentally weak and fragile.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I do not know whether hon. Members have heard of  a\r\n\r\ncountry  called  Eritrea.   Eritrea  is  located  on  the\r\n\r\neastern  part  of  Africa.  It used to be a  province  of\r\n\r\nEthiopia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1970s, when I was studying in Oxford, I met a\r\n\r\nfellow-student  who told me that he was from  Eritrea.  I\r\n\r\nwas a little struck since Eritrea was at that time not an\r\n\r\nindependent country. It was fighting a fierce war to gain\r\n\r\nindependence from Ethiopia.  Why did he say he  was  from\r\n\r\nEritrea  rather  than Ethiopia?  Subsequently,  I  learnt\r\n\r\nthat  he  was a medical student.  One day, I  asked  him,\r\n\r\n\"What  are your plans after your graduation?\"   He  said,\r\n\r\n\"After I have qualified as a medical doctor, I would like\r\n\r\nto  go  back  to my country.  Every day, every  night,  I\r\n\r\nthink  of my motherland.  My people need me.  My soldiers\r\n\r\nin  the  frontline need me. I feel guilty living  such  a\r\n\r\ncomfortable  life  in England when my motherland  and  my\r\n\r\npeople are at war.\"  His heart was with his native  land.\r\n\r\nSo  he  went  back  to  Eritrea.  What  happened  to  him\r\n\r\nsubsequently, I do not know.  But he is a real  \"stayer\".\r\n\r\nHe  is  an  elite  in  his country.   After  his  medical\r\n\r\nstudies, he could have stayed back in England and live  a\r\n\r\ncomfortable life.  Yet, he chose to return to his  native\r\n\r\nland to serve his people at war.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we ask our Singaporeans, I believe more than 95%\r\n\r\nwill  say  that they are staying. I asked our  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders  and  all of them said,  \"We are  staying.  Where\r\n\r\nelse  can  we go?  Singapore is our country.\"  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  why Mr Low Thia Khiang is so pessimistic about  our\r\n\r\npeople.  He  has certainly misunderstood Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nintention  when  the terms \"stayers\" and \"quitters\"  were\r\n\r\nintroduced. The Prime Minister is not putting  labels  on\r\n\r\npeople. He is provoking Singaporeans to think hard  about\r\n\r\nthe issue of rootedness as Singapore continued to develop\r\n\r\nand  globalise.  Treat rootedness  as  a  test.  We  have\r\n\r\nattained  95  marks, and we all know the  PAP  Government\r\n\r\nwill  not be satisfied until it attains 100 marks -  full\r\n\r\nmarks.  We are not satisfied with 95 marks, but know  the\r\n\r\nneed  for the extra effort and commitment to get the last\r\n\r\n5  marks.  There is a Chinese proverb: \"It is  better  to\r\n\r\nprovoke  a general than to give him an order.\" Hence  the\r\n\r\nprovocation  and the debate of this Motion to  facilitate\r\n\r\nfull deliberation on the issue of stayers and quitters in\r\n\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I mentioned Eritrea. Eritrea is an\r\n\r\nagricultural   country,  and   by   nature,   people   in\r\n\r\nagricultural countries have a deep-rooted love for  their\r\n\r\nland  because they worked on their land which  fed  them.\r\n\r\nIn  ancient  China, however senior or rich you  are,  the\r\n\r\ncommon  aspiration was to go back to your  hometown  upon\r\n\r\nretirement and be buried in your native village. This  is\r\n\r\ncalled  \"The falling leaf returning to the root\". However\r\n\r\nin  a globalised world, will there be this same sentiment\r\n\r\nas in the agricultural countries?  That is the question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly we are not contented with 95 marks. We\r\n\r\nmust  achieve 100 marks.  We have to work hard  to  score\r\n\r\n100  marks.  We want to make everyone in Singapore to  be\r\n\r\nlike  the people in the agricultural countries, having  a\r\n\r\ndeep-rooted love for his motherland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly we have to achieve 100 marks for our\r\n\r\nnation.  Because of the need for economic development, we\r\n\r\nhave to be globalised.  Singapore cannot achieve economic\r\n\r\ngrowth as an agricultural\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountry  to  solve our problems.  Globalised Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare elites of the country. There will be more amongst the\r\n\r\n3G  Singaporeans who globalise, because of  their  higher\r\n\r\neducation   and  their  cosmopolitan  outlook.  Singapore\r\n\r\ncannot  afford  to  lose them. Hence this  debate  is  to\r\n\r\nstimulate our people to reflect on this issue of  stayers\r\n\r\nand quitters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said that we do not have\r\n\r\ncharacter as a people, a nation, and a political  system.\r\n\r\nI disagree. When we Singaporeans are abroad, we feel very\r\n\r\nclose  to  each  other  when we meet  fellow  countrymen.\r\n\r\nUnlike others, we Singaporeans queue up at counters  even\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are  overseas.  We are  proud  to  have  done\r\n\r\nnational   service.   National  service  is   a   crucial\r\n\r\nprogramme  that  moulds our nation. So  we  are  rich  in\r\n\r\ncharacter that identifies us as Singaporeans. How can  Mr\r\n\r\nLow  say  we  are  lacking in character as  a  people,  a\r\n\r\nnation, and a political system?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the third-generation Singaporeans, how\r\n\r\nare  we going to improve from 95 marks to 100 marks?   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  have to create conditions conducive  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our economy, so that they feel  there  are\r\n\r\nopportunities to optimise the use of their talents and do\r\n\r\nwell here.  We have to do better in three areas which  we\r\n\r\nare already doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we must help all discover the spirit of\r\n\r\ngiving  to society. Giving produces a sense of pride  and\r\n\r\npleasure. Such good feelings can be addictive:  The  more\r\n\r\nwe  give,  the  better the feeling. This can  lead  to  a\r\n\r\ngreater desire to give, which in turn generate more  good\r\n\r\nfeeling.  There is a maxim, \"To give is more blessed than\r\n\r\nto  take.\"  This will lead to a benign circle.   In  this\r\n\r\nway,  we  will achieve 100 marks in fostering a sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministry of Community Development and Sports (MCDS)\r\n\r\nwill  facilitate more volunteerism. We need  to  increase\r\n\r\nfurther  volunteer participation rate and the  number  of\r\n\r\npeople  who do volunteer work.  The Community Development\r\n\r\nCouncils  (CDCs) have introduced many programmes  on  the\r\n\r\nground, and have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovided more channels and varieties to volunteerism.  We\r\n\r\nshould also have more opportunities for the volunteers to\r\n\r\nuse  both  their  brains and their hands, since  actually\r\n\r\ndirtying   one's  hand  to  get  things  done   increases\r\n\r\ncommitment  and a feeling of giving. MCDS  and  CDCs  are\r\n\r\ncontinuing to improve on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to have a sense of belonging, we need to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  family ties of the 3G Singaporeans.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has been urging the young people in  Singapore\r\n\r\nto set up happy families.  They should not only spend all\r\n\r\ntheir  time and energy on their work alone.  They  should\r\n\r\nconsider  setting  up families as an  important  goal  in\r\n\r\nlife.  Because family is the place where their hearts are\r\n\r\nanchored.  So the feeling for their family, the love  for\r\n\r\ntheir  family  will be broadened into the  love  for  the\r\n\r\nnation,  and  hence  become another reason  to  stay.   A\r\n\r\nfriend of mine told her friend's family story. This is  a\r\n\r\nrather  typical family with a father, a mother, a brother\r\n\r\nand  a  sister.   The sister went overseas  for  studies,\r\n\r\nmarried  to a foreigner and settled down in that country.\r\n\r\nShe  told her brother, \"There are plenty of opportunities\r\n\r\nhere.   Why don't you come here?\"  After some persuasion,\r\n\r\nthe brother left Singapore and went to join his sister in\r\n\r\nthat  country.  He persuaded his girlfriend to go  along.\r\n\r\nThey  got  married, and settled down there.  Then,  after\r\n\r\nsome  time,  they invited the father and mother  to  join\r\n\r\nthem.   The parents were initially not willing to go  but\r\n\r\nsince two of their children were there, they went. Sounds\r\n\r\nlike a sad story for the stayers? Not really. A few years\r\n\r\nlater, the mother passed away. The father felt lonely and\r\n\r\nbored in a foreign land because his friends and relatives\r\n\r\nwere  in Singapore. So father came back to Singapore.  As\r\n\r\nthe  brother missed his father, and his wife  missed  her\r\n\r\nparents  and  friends too, they decided to move  back  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  too.  Their feelings for  Singapore  are  even\r\n\r\nstronger than before.   So it does not matter where  your\r\n\r\nphysical  presence  is, so long as  your  heart  is  with\r\n\r\nSingapore, one day you will return. Family and friendship\r\n\r\nare major pull factors for the stayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence MCDS has set up a 'Family Matters Singapore'\r\n\r\nCommittee to continue to work towards encouraging  people\r\n\r\nto  set up families and strengthen their families.   This\r\n\r\nis  an  arduous  task,  but it is a  task  that  must  be\r\n\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we have to consider or give emphasis to\r\n\r\npatriotism in our Moral Education Programme.   Of course,\r\n\r\nwe  hope  our  nation will never be plunged into  serious\r\n\r\nnational  crisis,  but there are a  lot  of  stories  and\r\n\r\nlegends  in  history that show that one's true commitment\r\n\r\nwill  be reflected only in dire adversity.  This can help\r\n\r\ninculcate patriotism in our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that when I was in secondary school,\r\n\r\nthere was this chapter called \"The Young Patriot\" in  our\r\n\r\nChinese  textbook.  It was about a poor Italian  boy  who\r\n\r\nwas  a beggar on board a ship. One day, he came across  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of tourists from England, France and some European\r\n\r\ncountries who gave him some money. These people  gossiped\r\n\r\nabout  the places they visited. They started to criticise\r\n\r\nall  the bad things about Italy: that it was dirty,  full\r\n\r\nof pickpockets, etc. Suddenly a few coins rained on them.\r\n\r\nThey  turned and saw the Italian boy staring hard at them\r\n\r\nand shouted, \"You insulted my country. I do not want your\r\n\r\nstinking money!\"  This story has touched me, even  today.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many  other stories that I read  when  I  was\r\n\r\nstudying,  like \"The Drummer Boy\" and \"The  Last  Lesson\"\r\n\r\naimed at inculcating patriotism and national pride in our\r\n\r\nyoung hearts. I hope our students today continue to  read\r\n\r\nthese stories which would do them a lot of good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem we are addressing is not third\r\n\r\ngeneration  Singaporeans  being  labelled  \"quitters\"  or\r\n\r\n\"stayers\".   It is how to improve from 95  marks  to  100\r\n\r\nmarks.  Our challenge is how to retain the stay  instinct\r\n\r\nof   an   agricultural  society  like  Eritrea,  yet   be\r\n\r\naggressive and successful in globalisation.   If  we  can\r\n\r\nalways  remember falling leaves returning to  the  roots,\r\n\r\nand  always  have  our  hearts  in  Singapore  while   we\r\n\r\nglobalise, I believe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  will thrive and flourish for many  generations\r\n\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\nwould seem that Singaporeans from all walks of life  have\r\n\r\nbeen  up  in  arms at various points over the  last  nine\r\n\r\nmonths  about  many issues.  These range from  bread  and\r\n\r\nbutter ones, such as the transport fare hikes to the  pay\r\n\r\nof  a  CEO  and,  most  recently, to increase  in  public\r\n\r\nhospital charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Straits Times' journalist Ong Soh Chin puts it\r\n\r\n\"while  stayers and quitters were making their  arguments\r\n\r\nheard, the real revolution was not the issue at hand, but\r\n\r\nthe  fact that such debate was being aired publicly\" and,\r\n\r\nI  would  add, so robustly.  Hence, contrary to what  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member, Mr Low Thia Khiang, has noted earlier,  the\r\n\r\npeople  are  able and do air their views.   Indeed,  does\r\n\r\nthis   not  in  itself  indicate  that  there  are   many\r\n\r\nemotionally  connected, committed  and  actively  engaged\r\n\r\nSingaporeans amongst us?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much displeasure has been expressed, particularly by\r\n\r\nthe  educated  young and professionals  -  the  so-called\r\n\r\ncosmopolitans   -  regarding  the  PM's   \"stayers\"   and\r\n\r\n\"quitters\" label even though the PM took pains to explain\r\n\r\nthat,  by quitters, he meant those who throw in the towel\r\n\r\nand  take  flight just as the going gets  tough  and  not\r\n\r\nsimply all those who leave the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would venture to say that the \"stayers\" and\r\n\r\n\"quitters\"  issue is an age-old problem  and  exists  not\r\n\r\njust  in  Singapore  but everywhere.   For  instance,  in\r\n\r\nBritain, a recent study showed that half of those  polled\r\n\r\nwanted  to  move  to another country.   In  Singapore,  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  in  September 2002 by the Singapore Institute  of\r\n\r\nInternational  Affairs  of 150  junior  college  students\r\n\r\nfound  that  67%  plan to stay abroad or  work  overseas,\r\n\r\nwhilst 69% said they saw a future here.  The main reasons\r\n\r\nfor  coming back are family ties, friendship and a  sense\r\n\r\nof belonging.  One could say that not all is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlost  for our 3G Singaporeans.  Nonetheless, efforts must\r\n\r\nbe  made  by  the Government to find out why increasingly\r\n\r\nmore  Singaporeans  appear  to  be  disenfranchised  with\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  do not feel a sense of  belonging.   For\r\n\r\nthose who can and do quit, or wish to quit, what are  the\r\n\r\nroots of their rootlessness?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I submit that there are two causes for this\r\n\r\nsense  of rootlessness - one to be embraced and the other\r\n\r\nto be engaged.  Firstly, globalisation.  Globalisation is\r\n\r\nan  inexorable  force  that can at one  time  enrich  and\r\n\r\nimpoverish nations.  One byproduct is the creation  of  a\r\n\r\nclass  of mobile world citizens, who are equally at  home\r\n\r\nin  Oslo  as they might in Osaka.  They are the able  and\r\n\r\nthe  talented  ones who are sought after by  nations  and\r\n\r\npeoples  for  the value creating power they  wield  -  in\r\n\r\nindustry,  in  entertainment, in technology  and  in  the\r\n\r\narts.   Think of child prodigy musicians, like  Siow  Lee\r\n\r\nChin, entertainer Kit Chan, or top business brains,  like\r\n\r\nMcKinsey's  Asia  Chief Hsieh Tsun  Yan.   Interestingly,\r\n\r\nmany  of these are now returning home, if not physically,\r\n\r\nthen at least in connectedness, and making a contribution\r\n\r\nfrom New York, London, Taiwan or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world, including Singapore, embraces\r\n\r\nglobalisation  and  geographical and economic  boundaries\r\n\r\nblur,   more  global  citizens  would  emerge   and   the\r\n\r\ndistinction between stayers and quitters would  get  even\r\n\r\nfuzzier.  Besides, as many have already alluded  to,  one\r\n\r\ncould  feel  and  behave  like a  stayer  or  quitter  at\r\n\r\ndifferent points in time, depending on the circumstances.\r\n\r\nTake  myself, for instance.  I had studied and worked  in\r\n\r\nthe  US  for two years.  At the end of two years,  I  had\r\n\r\nthought  seriously of continuing my stay in  the  US,  at\r\n\r\nleast  for  some  time,  in  view  of  the  opportunities\r\n\r\navailable  as  well  as the different lifestyle  offered.\r\n\r\nOne  might say that I was then contemplating to  quit  on\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In the end, family ties, my husband's  desire\r\n\r\nto  return  and the fact that, in the US, one  could,  as\r\n\r\nJack  Neo  puts it, only be the second wife,  brought  me\r\n\r\nback to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many globally mobile Singaporeans (GMS), as DPM Lee\r\n\r\ncalls them, will still\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfeel a sense of belonging to their country of origin, but\r\n\r\ntheir  inner  unction is to a larger  calling.   This  is\r\n\r\ninevitable.    We  need  to  come  to  terms   with   the\r\n\r\naspirations  of  such  people in a global  village.   For\r\n\r\nthem,  we  should give our blessing, because so  long  as\r\n\r\nthey  carry a bit of Singapore in their heart, they  will\r\n\r\nremain  our ambassadors and bring Singapore to the world,\r\n\r\neven  as  we consciously bring the world to Singapore  in\r\n\r\nour quest for global talent to our shores.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by SM Lee, in this age of mass travel and\r\n\r\nmigration,   Singapore,  like  other   countries,   would\r\n\r\ninevitably lose some of its own talent.  However, we must\r\n\r\nretain  a  hard core of dedicated Singaporeans sufficient\r\n\r\nto  form  the  cornerstone of our society.  Then  we  can\r\n\r\nafford  some attrition.  Ultimately, enough must stay  at\r\n\r\nany  point  in  time to look after the place,  to  create\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think therein lies the heart of PM Goh's\r\n\r\nremarks addressed particularly to a younger generation of\r\n\r\nglobally  mobile Singaporeans, challenging them  to  make\r\n\r\nSingaporeans tick as their forefathers before  them  have\r\n\r\ndone, rather than as an issue of labelling which the hon.\r\n\r\nMember,  Mr Low Thia Khiang, seems to have simplistically\r\n\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second cause of rootlessness is of greater\r\n\r\nimportance   and   concern.    Dissonance   between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and its citizens, arising from disenchantment\r\n\r\non  a  host of issues that touches them.  Sir, I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  few  people actually quit Singapore for ideological\r\n\r\nreasons,    bar   political   dissidents,   conscientious\r\n\r\nobjectors,  and  those who are up to mischief,  but  they\r\n\r\nform  a small minority.  From what I observe, people quit\r\n\r\nbecause  of  frustration and/or a sense  of  betrayal  on\r\n\r\nspecific  issues  that touch them and  often  touch  them\r\n\r\ndeeply, such as education, or a Singaporean society being\r\n\r\ntoo regulated and rigid.  There is therefore a great need\r\n\r\nto  reduce  this  dissonance and  create  goodwill  among\r\n\r\ncitizens  in  general,  not  just  quitters  or  would-be\r\n\r\nquitters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all fairness, the Government has, by the\r\n\r\nvery act of initiating the Remaking\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore Committee, acknowledged that there is a need to\r\n\r\nreview  all  policies and programmes and leave  no  stone\r\n\r\nunturned in view of the generational change taking place.\r\n\r\nIt  has started in the right direction and what is needed\r\n\r\nnow  is  for the Government to take heed of all that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  said  and written with an open mind and  a  certain\r\n\r\nresolve and boldness to implement the necessary changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations of the ERC and the Remaking\r\n\r\nSingapore  Committee  must be taken seriously  and  acted\r\n\r\nupon,  where  feasible, to ensure  that  the  young  stay\r\n\r\nemotionally  connected  with  the  Government  and   with\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to highlight two major areas\r\n\r\nwhere  change has been called for or proposed and appears\r\n\r\nto  be  imperative  if quitters are to be  converted  and\r\n\r\nstayers  are to be further cultivated.  Neither are  new,\r\n\r\nand  I  suspect  there could be robust defence  from  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  concerned, but as there have been  much  angst\r\n\r\nand  ill-feelings  about them, I  feel,  Sir,  that  they\r\n\r\ndeserve yet another airing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, injecting more flexibility into the\r\n\r\neducation  system.  By most standards, we have undeniably\r\n\r\none   of   the  best  education  systems  in  the  world.\r\n\r\nIronically, education also appears to be one of the  main\r\n\r\nstress points that trigger quitting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anecdotal evidence suggests that many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  migrated to other countries due to their children's\r\n\r\neducation.   A  successful pediatrician  friend  of  mine\r\n\r\nmigrated to Australia a few years ago mainly because  his\r\n\r\nfour  children  were  all unable  to  cope  with  Chinese\r\n\r\nlessons.  Another friend, who was a teacher, migrated  to\r\n\r\nNew Zealand, as she wanted her eldest son, who was mildly\r\n\r\nautistic,  to  be enrolled in a mainstream school  rather\r\n\r\nthan a school for children with special needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another friend, who was already a senior civil\r\n\r\nservant in Singapore, decided to settle for good  in  New\r\n\r\nZealand after the expiry of her one-year no-pay leave to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccompany  her  husband who was there on a  one-year  job\r\n\r\nattachment.   She said that her two primary school  going\r\n\r\nchildren had enjoyed studying in New Zealand so much they\r\n\r\ndid  not  want  to come back to school in Singapore.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  she  claims  that her son's  myopia  had  improved\r\n\r\ntremendously during the one-year stay in New Zealand!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been proposals for a through-train\r\n\r\nsecondary  school/JC programme as well  as  more  subject\r\n\r\nchoices at the secondary and JC levels.  There have  also\r\n\r\nbeen calls, particularly by the polytechnic students, for\r\n\r\nlocal  universities  to admit more  diploma  holders.   A\r\n\r\nfourth  university,  or at least an off-campus  extension\r\n\r\nuniversity  to,  among  others, allow  these  polytechnic\r\n\r\ngraduates  who  meet the grades to enter university,  has\r\n\r\nalso been called for and is being studied by the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education.   Otherwise,  many  polytechnic  graduates\r\n\r\nleave  for overseas universities each year.  A  few  have\r\n\r\nbeen  known to eventually quit the country as  they  felt\r\n\r\nthat they were treated as second-class citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been calls for an arts school, in\r\n\r\naddition  to  a sports school, to accommodate  the  young\r\n\r\nwith  different  talents and abilities  besides  academic\r\n\r\nability.   Pleas  have also been made for  the  education\r\n\r\npolicy  of children with special needs to be more aligned\r\n\r\nto  those  of  mainstream schools, such as  having  these\r\n\r\nschools   come  under  the  ambit  of  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation, special education teachers to be on  the  same\r\n\r\nsalary  scale  as  those in the mainstream  schools,  and\r\n\r\nallowing  more  special needs children to  be  integrated\r\n\r\ninto mainstream schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These proposals have been largely suggested to give\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  more options, inject more  flexibility  and\r\n\r\ncompassion   into  the  education  system,  and   nurture\r\n\r\ncreativity and an entrepreneurial spirit among our young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most recently, the ERC's education workgroup's\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to  lift the restriction  on  Singaporean\r\n\r\nstudents attending international schools here would  also\r\n\r\nhelp minimise the leakage of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlocal  students to overseas schools as well as  migration\r\n\r\ndue  to children's education.  As noted by the committee,\r\n\r\nlifting  the restriction on local students would  give  a\r\n\r\nsecond chance to local students who do not do well in the\r\n\r\npublic  schools, as they may be able to do  better  under\r\n\r\nthe international schools' curriculum.  This idea appears\r\n\r\nto  have found strong support by parents.  As one  letter\r\n\r\nwriter  to  Today puts it, \"International schools  are  a\r\n\r\ngood  alternative for the minority of parents  who  think\r\n\r\nthe  national  school system is inappropriate  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  As a progressive society, we should allow  and\r\n\r\nrespect such diversity of opinion and personal values.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nto  seriously  consider these proposals,  if  it  is  not\r\n\r\nalready studying them, and to be bold in adopting many of\r\n\r\nthese  proposals.  I believe that in this way many would-be  quitters  could  be converted, and  the  fidelity  of\r\n\r\nstayers strengthened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, engaging more Singaporeans. With regard\r\n\r\nto  this point, I would first like to revisit what  seems\r\n\r\nto be the perennial favourite topic - feedback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had, during the Budget debate in April, noted\r\n\r\nthat  a  friend of mine had asked, \"Where is the feedback\r\n\r\nto my feedback?\"  Some months have passed, but it appears\r\n\r\nthat   this  is  still  a  common  refrain  amongst  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   At  a recent feedback session  for  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, it was reported that the youths had  asked,\r\n\r\n\"How  much of what they said and felt would be channelled\r\n\r\nto the Government?  To what extent did policy makers take\r\n\r\ntheir  views  into  consideration when making  decisions?\r\n\r\nAnd  how  could  they feel a sense of belonging  here  if\r\n\r\ntheir views did not count?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a yawning gap between the\r\n\r\nGovernment's and the public's perception of the  feedback\r\n\r\nmechanism.   This  is  despite the fact  that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  had,  in his National Day Rally speech,  pulled\r\n\r\nout  the  example of Chek Jawa, amongst others,  to  show\r\n\r\nthat the Government does listen to and act\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  feedback.  The Prime Minister had also noted that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot run a country based on feedback  alone\r\n\r\nnor  should it bend to every whim and fancy.  But, on the\r\n\r\nflip  side,  there is a real danger that this  perception\r\n\r\ngap  could widen as Singaporeans become more educated and\r\n\r\ninformed,   and   increasingly  demand   greater   public\r\n\r\nconsultation and voice in policy formulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close the perception gap and ensure that the\r\n\r\nfeedback  mechanism is not viewed as a  black  hole,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment could, as far as possible, allow for more pre-policy  rather than post-policy feedback.   It  is  noted\r\n\r\nthat the Government is already heading in this direction,\r\n\r\nas there have been more feedback sought, eg, on the ERC's\r\n\r\nrecommendations, Remaking Singapore, and  the  review  of\r\n\r\nthe JC and secondary school education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should also make a conscious effort\r\n\r\nto  identify changes which have been made due largely  to\r\n\r\nfeedback  received.  As Dr Ow Chin Hock  recently  noted:\r\n\r\n\"Whenever possible, acknowledge the contributions of  the\r\n\r\nfeedback  providers.\"  This would give people a sense  of\r\n\r\nownership,   that   they   have   made   a   constructive\r\n\r\ncontribution to policy making.  Perhaps, the inclusion of\r\n\r\nmy female, single MPs in Parliament today, as well as the\r\n\r\nchange  in  policy to allow male civil servants  to  take\r\n\r\nchild medical sick leave, could be attributed in part  to\r\n\r\nsome feedback received in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ultimately, to break the perception\r\n\r\ndeadlock and reduce the dissonance between the Government\r\n\r\nand  its citizens, there will have to be a mindset change\r\n\r\nby  both parties.  Otherwise, the perception gap would be\r\n\r\na vicious cycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people say that the Government does not listen,\r\n\r\nwhilst the Government says that it does.  We do not  like\r\n\r\nthe Government to tell us what to do.  Yet, each time  we\r\n\r\nhave  a crisis, we run to it for solutions.  We know that\r\n\r\nour  Government  will do its best and,  thus,  are  quite\r\n\r\nhappy to leave it to do the thinking for us.  However, if\r\n\r\nwhat  it  does  is  not to our satisfaction,  we  have  a\r\n\r\nscapegoat.  We grow up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrelying on the Government to think ahead for us, and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment grew up doing just that, appearing to be  more\r\n\r\nused to giving directives than listening to feedback and,\r\n\r\nthus, the \"Father knows best\" perception.  It took us  37\r\n\r\nyears to grow into this mould.  Hence, time is needed for\r\n\r\nboth parties to change and adapt to their new roles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by Mr Tan Tarn How of the Straits Times,\r\n\r\nthe  Government must accept that whilst it may know more,\r\n\r\nit  does not mean that it knows better - if I may add, at\r\n\r\nleast  not all the time.  The people must also understand\r\n\r\nthat if they want more flexibility, greater freedom, more\r\n\r\nsay  and  more  choices,  then they  cannot  run  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  help at the slightest hint  of  trouble.\r\n\r\nWill this change of style and tone create more risks  for\r\n\r\nboth the Government and the governed?  Most certainly  it\r\n\r\nwill, but taking risks and getting hurt in the process is\r\n\r\nthe essence of the new economy.  Sir, I would venture  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  in this new Internet era, governments  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  a  choice  but to accept greater messiness  in  the\r\n\r\nsocial and political spheres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area for engaging the people relates to\r\n\r\nNational  Education and bonding.  Besides policy  changes\r\n\r\nthat  could  strengthen  our 3G  Singaporeans'  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging, many of which have already been identified  by\r\n\r\nthe  ERC  and the Remaking Singapore Committee,  National\r\n\r\nEducation,  where  our  young  are  given  lessons  about\r\n\r\nSingapore,  would help to give them a sense of  identity.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Minister for Education succinctly puts it:   \"We\r\n\r\nwant  them  to  know the Singapore Story - how  Singapore\r\n\r\nsucceeded against the odds\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that our schools are the incubators\r\n\r\nfor  our  future stayers - the citizens who are proud  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Hence our National Education programme should\r\n\r\ncontinue   and  should  be  further  built   upon.    The\r\n\r\nachievements and successes of Singapore and Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nsuch   as   local  literature,  locally-produced   films,\r\n\r\nsuccessful businessmen\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  businesses, could be compiled for National Education\r\n\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also continue to encourage family-based\r\n\r\nactivities  to  build  stronger family  units,  community\r\n\r\nactivities  to foster ties among friends and  neighbours,\r\n\r\nas  well  as organise more national events that  seek  to\r\n\r\nbind  all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language  and\r\n\r\nreligion.  This is especially so in the light of  the  JI\r\n\r\narrests,  which  have  put  our Malay/Muslim  compatriots\r\n\r\nunder an uncomfortable spotlight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, a national coordinating body could\r\n\r\nbe  formed  to organise events at the national level  for\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans.  One such idea that arose  out  of  my\r\n\r\nrecent IRCC focus group discussion was organising a  huge\r\n\r\nreligious \"Expo\" at the national level.  Talks  could  be\r\n\r\ngiven  at  the  \"Expo\"  by various religious  leaders  to\r\n\r\nenlighten members of the public about the basic tenets of\r\n\r\nall  major  religions practised in Singapore, to  promote\r\n\r\nbetter understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of the whole issue, Sir, is the\r\n\r\nfundamental  question of what it is that connects  us  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is true that physical location per se does\r\n\r\nnot  make  a stayer or a quitter.  It is more  where  the\r\n\r\nheart  is  that defines the stayer or quitter.   But  the\r\n\r\nphysical  and the tangibles are the symbols  that  define\r\n\r\nthe boundaries of our heart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the end, I believe it is the combination of\r\n\r\nthe  people  - our families and loved ones,  friends  and\r\n\r\nemotional  bonds  of  kinship; the place  -  the  sights,\r\n\r\nsounds  and  smells of the familiar, and the things  that\r\n\r\nloosely define Singaporean-ness, such as chicken rice and\r\n\r\nthe  ubiquitous HDB flats; and, finally, the privilege  - our  birth  rights  as citizens and, thus,  \"first  wife\"\r\n\r\nstatus, as per Jack Neo, that determine our rootedness to\r\n\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent times, the last factor - privilege - which\r\n\r\ntranslates  into the opportunity to forge  a  partnership\r\n\r\nwith  the Government in charting Singapore's path,  seems\r\n\r\nto  take  on more significance among the young.  This  is\r\n\r\nevidenced by the young clamouring at feedback\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsessions to be heard and to know what role they can  play\r\n\r\nin policy making.  A combination of the ability and means\r\n\r\nto  be  more  footloose as well as Singapore's  uncertain\r\n\r\neconomic future may have led to this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's existence is in many ways a historical\r\n\r\naccident.   We  are a nation constrained by limited  land\r\n\r\nand  people.   Our survival as a nation  is  thus  not  a\r\n\r\ngiven, and we would always have to create our niche in  a\r\n\r\nglobal  village  in  order to  survive.   Hence,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the Government and the people need to  pull  and\r\n\r\nwork together in order to make the quitters stayers,  and\r\n\r\nthe stayers the shapers of our collective destiny.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Thank\r\n\r\nyou, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this issue was raised by the Hon. Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in his National Day Rally speech.  As alluded to\r\n\r\nbefore  me,  it is not about emigration and  immigration.\r\n\r\nIt  is  really about a sense of belonging and  ownership.\r\n\r\nDig deeper, it is about what it means to be a Singaporean\r\n\r\nin  these  uncertain times.  Many Singaporeans  chose  to\r\n\r\ndismiss  this  issue  by  saying  that  there  are   many\r\n\r\noutstanding  Singaporeans  who  were  quitters  of  their\r\n\r\nprevious homeland, including some former and even present\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House.  They also  say  that  to  stop\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  from  quitting  contradicts  the  call  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  go  global.   With  respect,  again  as\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  my  colleagues before me, these  responses\r\n\r\nreally  miss  the  point - the debate  on  the  label  of\r\n\r\n\"stayers\"  and  \"quitters\",  instead  of  discussing  the\r\n\r\nactual concerns of the Hon. Prime Minister in his speech.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  I  am glad that the Prime Minister  raised  this\r\n\r\nissue to a level that deserves urgent national concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I have come across Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nreally  cause  me  worry.  There was  this  man  who  was\r\n\r\nreleased  from  prison  but felt  that  he  was  unjustly\r\n\r\nsentenced.  He blamed the prosecutors,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  justice system and even his defence lawyers for  the\r\n\r\nalleged injustice.  He found it difficult to get  a  job,\r\n\r\nand again blamed the legal system for casting a stigma on\r\n\r\nhim.   He took up a retraining course in PSA, but failed.\r\n\r\nHe  blamed  the  PSA  for  having  conducted  the  course\r\n\r\nimproperly and came to see me for a refund.  And then  he\r\n\r\naccuses the Government of being biased in favour  of  the\r\n\r\ntens  of thousands of Malaysian women who get to work  in\r\n\r\nour  factories and he could not.  Along the way, Sir,  he\r\n\r\ntells  me  that  he  feels a neighbouring  country  would\r\n\r\nprovide  him  a job and peace of mind.  He  threatens  to\r\n\r\nmigrate  there  and,  for good measure,  he  accuses  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   of   failing  to  maintain  good   bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations with that neighbouring country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another resident wanted to rent a flat from the HDB.\r\n\r\nShe  is  married to a foreigner, and so does not qualify.\r\n\r\nShe  also earns above the means test figure, but she says\r\n\r\nshe   suffers   from  some  medical  ailment.    She   is\r\n\r\ndisappointed  that the Government or  the  HDB  does  not\r\n\r\nhelp,  and  goes  into  a tirade  that  she  is  unjustly\r\n\r\ntreated.   Again,  she says she might  as  well  migrate,\r\n\r\nwhere  she feels she would be better treated.  These  two\r\n\r\ncitizens  used  emigration as a threat to obtain  certain\r\n\r\nassistance  or services.  I believe that there  are  many\r\n\r\nsuch  similar examples.  It saddens me greatly that  some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans see the value of citizenship as only that  - a weapon to be used when demanding for help.  To my mind,\r\n\r\nsuch Singaporeans have quit before they even leave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to expect everyone to agree with\r\n\r\nall Government policies.  Some people disagree enough  to\r\n\r\nwant  to leave the country as a result.  I do not  regard\r\n\r\nthem  as  having  quit  Singapore.   They  do  not  treat\r\n\r\ncitizenship  lightly.   They  considered  carefully   the\r\n\r\nreasons for leaving and made a conscious decision.  There\r\n\r\nare  also those who are more pulled than pushed, a  point\r\n\r\nalluded  to  by my colleague, Ms Indranee earlier.  These\r\n\r\nare  usually  the more adventurous among  us.  They  take\r\n\r\nrisks and usually bear no grudges against Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nfirst group has to be handled differently from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  second  and third. For the second and third  groups,\r\n\r\nthe  challenge  is  how  to ensure  that  the  links  are\r\n\r\nmaintained even while they are away.  For the first,  the\r\n\r\nchallenge is how to prevent them from reaching that point\r\n\r\nto issue threat to leave in the first place.  In crafting\r\n\r\npolicies in this regard, we have to recognise that  there\r\n\r\nare  different  categories  of  people  who  have  to  be\r\n\r\napproached differently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, Sir, the common thread that runs\r\n\r\nthrough  these issues is the cultivation of  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging and ownership.  How do we do this?  One way  of\r\n\r\nmany, as suggested in one of the sessions in the remaking\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  is  to involve more Singaporeans  in  the\r\n\r\ndecision-making   process,  to  enable  Singaporeans   to\r\n\r\nidentify  themselves with the process of governance  even\r\n\r\nif  they disagree with Government.  One way of doing this\r\n\r\nis  by devolving more of the governance to the people. We\r\n\r\nalready  see  this  being  put  in  place.  We  see   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of Town Councils.  We also note  that  the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  Councils (CDCs)  are  given  more\r\n\r\npowers  and  responsibilities to  manage  more  and  more\r\n\r\naspects of their respective zones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite the example of COMPASS, which\r\n\r\nstands  for Community and Parents in Support of  Schools.\r\n\r\nIt  is a committee chaired presently by the Hon. Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  for  Education,  previously  by  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself.     The   committee   comprises   educationists,\r\n\r\nbusinessmen,   industrialists,  community   leaders   and\r\n\r\nparents.   I declare, Sir, that I have been a  Member  of\r\n\r\nCOMPASS for almost four years now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPASS seeks to enhance greater school-community\r\n\r\npartnership.     It    seeks   to   establish    stronger\r\n\r\ncollaboration   among  the  stakeholders  of   education,\r\n\r\nschools,   the  Ministry,  parents,  community   leaders,\r\n\r\ncommunity  institutions, businesses,  industries,  alumni\r\n\r\ngroups,  school  management committees  and,  of  course,\r\n\r\nstudents  themselves.  It allows these stakeholders,  not\r\n\r\njust  the  Ministry and teachers, to be involved  in  the\r\n\r\ngovernance of schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOver  the last four years, the number of parents  support\r\n\r\ngroups  or  similar  groups  in  schools  has  more  than\r\n\r\ndoubled.   Many more schools now have established  alumni\r\n\r\ngroups and networking with community institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPASS, I believe, is succeeding in its efforts to\r\n\r\ninvolve  the  various stakeholders, which is attributable\r\n\r\nto  three  factors.   One, clear  objectives  and  focus.\r\n\r\nSecond,  dynamic leadership at the policy and operational\r\n\r\nlevels. Three, clear deliverables.  I believe, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe above formula can be replicated elsewhere, of course,\r\n\r\nwith  necessary changes.  There are indeed other  equally\r\n\r\neffective  structures that have allowed many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  be involved in the process of governance, such as the\r\n\r\nS21   Committee  mentioned  earlier,  the   Remaking   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Committee, feedback groups, dialogue  sessions\r\n\r\nand  so  on.   Sir, I believe that we should continue  to\r\n\r\nexpand and deepen the involvement of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of what it means to be\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  besides suggesting what Government  should\r\n\r\ndo, what policies should be crafted, it is also important\r\n\r\nto  ask  what  Singaporeans  could  do.   In  respect  of\r\n\r\nparticipation in the process of governance,  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nshould   realise  that  not  every  suggestion   can   be\r\n\r\nimplemented.  This point was alluded to before by two  of\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues.  If your suggestion is not  accepted,  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  necessarily mean that the  Government  is  not\r\n\r\nlistening.  The perception that the Government  does  not\r\n\r\nlisten  has  been  cited  as  a  reason  for  people  not\r\n\r\nbothering  to  participate. The fact  is  that  in  every\r\n\r\nissue,  there  is  always a difference of  opinion.   The\r\n\r\nultimate decision is more often than not an aggregate  of\r\n\r\nall views or suggestions or the best among many.  And  in\r\n\r\nboth  cases,  it  is  not  possible  to  accommodate  all\r\n\r\nindividual  views.  I believe my hon. colleague,  Mr  Gan\r\n\r\nKim  Yong,  mentioned this earlier.  But  to  participate\r\n\r\nmeaningfully  in the process of governance,  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust  be  prepared to accept differences of opinions  and\r\n\r\neven be defeated in arguments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must learn and must be able to accord\r\n\r\ngreater deference to the process that allows his views to\r\n\r\nbe  heard  over the actual views that he raises  himself.\r\n\r\nThis  requires  a  mindset change. We  can  all  ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to craft and implement policies to effect this\r\n\r\nmindset change but this is somewhat paradoxical.  How  do\r\n\r\nwe reconcile the desire that we all participate in active\r\n\r\ngovernance and yet not participate in the crafting of the\r\n\r\nvery policy itself?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the journey towards a more\r\n\r\nparticipative society where there is greater ownership of\r\n\r\ngovernance and in the future of the country is off  to  a\r\n\r\ngood  start,  Singaporeans must first take  ownership  of\r\n\r\nthis  issue.  If we, as Singaporeans, are not willing  to\r\n\r\npush  for greater participation, take the trouble to  air\r\n\r\nviews  and  face the consequences, then there  is  really\r\n\r\nvery little for any government to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, as observed by Dr Amy Khor earlier,\r\n\r\nmore  and more issues are being debated by more and  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and even more openly.  I urge  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto persist in doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not my intention to say that those who\r\n\r\nkeep quiet are necessarily passive and inactive citizens.\r\n\r\nMany  Singaporeans may not articulate their views in  the\r\n\r\nmedia or sit in high-powered committees but they are  all\r\n\r\nimportant Singaporeans nonetheless.  They care for  their\r\n\r\nfamilies, they care for their neighbours, they  care  for\r\n\r\ntheir  colleagues.   People still care.   There  is  much\r\n\r\nhope.  With this hope, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to speak on the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did we move this motion? Why are there some\r\n\r\npeople  who  choose  to leave Singapore  for  good?   The\r\n\r\nreasons  behind all these have been very well alluded  to\r\n\r\nby  a  number of hon. Members before me and I  shall  not\r\n\r\ndwell on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, we must always accept the fact that\r\n\r\nthere  will always be people looking for greener  pasture\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  But, on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nrealise  that  many  Singaporeans  who  are  capable   of\r\n\r\nemigrating, have chosen to stay put.  Even many  of  them\r\n\r\nworking  overseas are still maintaining their bonds  with\r\n\r\nSingapore. Why do they stay?  Maybe by focusing  on  what\r\n\r\nmakes  these  Singaporeans stay on, we  can  continue  to\r\n\r\nbuild on the emotional linkages with all the Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand deal with the problem that way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you the story of an unhappy young man.\r\n\r\nThere  is this young doctor who, after his basic  medical\r\n\r\ntraining,  applied for traineeship and  a  posting  in  a\r\n\r\nspecialty that he is interested in.  As a medical doctor,\r\n\r\nif  you want to become a specialist, you have to go  into\r\n\r\nthe  area  of your interest and get a posting there,  and\r\n\r\nthen you can do the specialist examinations and become  a\r\n\r\nspecialist.  But he was turned down because  he  did  not\r\n\r\nhave any posting in that specialty before and he did  not\r\n\r\npass  Part I of that specialty examination.  However,  he\r\n\r\ncould  not have sat for the Part I examination if he  did\r\n\r\nnot  have  any  posting  in that area.   He  became  very\r\n\r\nfrustrated.   He  got  caught in this catch-22  position.\r\n\r\nEventually, he got the traineeship overseas  and  off  he\r\n\r\nwent.   He spent a few years in UK.  After he passed  his\r\n\r\nspecialist training, his consultant there had wanted  him\r\n\r\nto  stay  on  and  offered him a  job.   One  would  have\r\n\r\nexpected him, from what he has experienced previously  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, to accept the job, but he chose to  come  back\r\n\r\nto Singapore.  The story did not end there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came back, the almighty MOH officials told\r\n\r\nhim  that he had to start working as a Temporary  Medical\r\n\r\nOfficer,   although  he  was  already  qualified   as   a\r\n\r\nRegistrar.  Worse still, he was offered the salary  of  a\r\n\r\nsecond  year  Medical  Officer, the  point  he  left  the\r\n\r\nservices several years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a friend of this young man in Hong\r\n\r\nKong  actually  got  him  a job  as  a  lecturer  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity hospital there.  The pay package, with housing\r\n\r\nallowance, was about four times higher than what  he  got\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  However, he chose to stay on again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people might have taken the opportunity and\r\n\r\nmoved  on for the pay was higher and the prospect  seemed\r\n\r\nbrighter overseas.  Was this young man mad or not?   Yes,\r\n\r\nhe  might have been, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.  This  young\r\n\r\nman  is a psychiatrist and this young man is myself.  You\r\n\r\nsee, sometimes, psychiatrists do things quite unusually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I choose to remain in Singapore? I believe,\r\n\r\nfor  the  same reasons, many Singaporeans have chosen  to\r\n\r\nstay  on.  I grew up here.  My parents who worked so hard\r\n\r\nto  bring  me up and to send me to school were here.   My\r\n\r\nbrothers  and sisters were here.  My friends  were  here.\r\n\r\nThe  community and the people whom I grew  up  with  were\r\n\r\nhere.  I wanted my kids to receive education here despite\r\n\r\nwhat  has been said about the education system.  And deep\r\n\r\ninside my heart, I know, as a Singaporean, there is  this\r\n\r\nsense  of  indebtedness  I have to  this  place  and  the\r\n\r\nattachment to this country.  For these reasons, I stayed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, many people also stay on for the economic\r\n\r\nprosperity, for the jobs that are available here,  for  a\r\n\r\nbetter  life,  for the safe and secure environment  here.\r\n\r\nBut  something  might not have gone right that  nowadays,\r\n\r\nthough  our  country is doing so well,  there  are  still\r\n\r\nyounger  Singaporeans  who want to emigrate,  more  often\r\n\r\nthan  not, for economic reasons.  Why?  I ask myself that\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I look at it, as a nation, we have a relatively\r\n\r\nshort  history.  In the past three to four  decades,  our\r\n\r\nemphasis  has been placed on economic progress and  quite\r\n\r\noften,  we emphasise on materialistic success.  I am  not\r\n\r\ncriticising our Government for having done that.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nwith  a  population of two million mouths to  feed,  that\r\n\r\nshould  be  the top priority of any sensible  Government.\r\n\r\nBut  the  education system, in response to  the  economic\r\n\r\nneed, has correspondingly focused on producing people for\r\n\r\nthe   job  market.   The  teaching  of  values,  national\r\n\r\nhistory,   humanity  and  culture  has   therefore   been\r\n\r\nrelegated maybe to a lesser priority.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, we may have inadvertently produced a\r\n\r\ngeneration   of  Singaporeans  whose  value   system   is\r\n\r\nprimarily materialistic and economic.  Their relationship\r\n\r\nwith  the country may also be measured on economic terms.\r\n\r\nThey  will see what this country can offer vis-a-vis what\r\n\r\nthey can get from another country, like doing shopping.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we want to bond Singaporeans to this country\r\n\r\nwith  purely  dollars and cents, we are doomed  to  fail.\r\n\r\nBecause, in bad times, when there is no money to be made,\r\n\r\nthey  will  pack and go.  So, we have to bond  them  with\r\n\r\ntheir hearts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our call to resonate in our fellow Singaporeans'\r\n\r\nhearts, they must have the same frequency.  The frequency\r\n\r\nof  the heart is the value system.  We must inculcate  in\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, young and old, to have the pride  of  being\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   There is no other reason.   Just  because\r\n\r\nyou  are  a  Singaporean, you should be  proud  of  being\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  And this pride can stem from  the  love  of\r\n\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop the love for our homeplace and our\r\n\r\ncountry, many have spoken on having a sense of belonging.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to call on the Government and  our  fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  develop two more senses.   One  is  the\r\n\r\nsense  of  indebtedness;  the  second  is  the  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is sense of indebtedness? We have always been\r\n\r\ntaught  about  our rights and opportunities.   Government\r\n\r\nshould  give me this, Government should give me that,  as\r\n\r\nif  the  world owes us a living.  We have not been taught\r\n\r\nto define our lives by our debts and the legacies that we\r\n\r\nhave,  but  by our rights and opportunities.  So,  it  is\r\n\r\nhigh time that we must inculcate this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see that maybe there are at least three types\r\n\r\nof indebtedness everyone has.  First is to mother nature,\r\n\r\nGod,  universe  or whatever you call it,  for  giving  us\r\n\r\nlife.   Second is to our parents for bringing us to  this\r\n\r\nworld,  educate  us and bring us up.   Third  is  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry for protecting us,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  providing us with the opportunities that we may grow\r\n\r\nand get to where we are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our people have to, first, develop this sense of\r\n\r\nindebtedness,  and  then will the  feeling  of  gratitude\r\n\r\nevolve.   With  this sense of indebtedness,  we  will  be\r\n\r\ngrateful  of what our parents have done for us  and  what\r\n\r\nthe  country has provided for us.  With that, we will  be\r\n\r\nspontaneous to have our sense of responsibility, like the\r\n\r\ndutiful children repaying their parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards sense of responsibility, too often, we\r\n\r\nare  Singaporeans  who, whenever anything  happens,  will\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Government  should do this, Government  should  do\r\n\r\nthat  .\".  I think it is also time that we must start  to\r\n\r\ninculcate    this    sense   of   responsibility    among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  so  that everyone is accountable  to  what\r\n\r\nhappens  to  this  country.   Only  with  that  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  will there be active participation  as  a\r\n\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing we need to do, I think, is to promote\r\n\r\npatriotism,  the love for our country.  It  was  actually\r\n\r\nvery  disheartening to hear that a number of Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndid  not  display  the  national flag  on  National  Day,\r\n\r\nbecause  they were unhappy with the state of the economy,\r\n\r\nand  maybe because of bus fare hikes, etc.  But,  on  the\r\n\r\nother   hand,  it  was  also  heartwarming  to   read   a\r\n\r\nSingaporean  who emigrated to Holland still displays  the\r\n\r\nnational flag every August.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patriotism is the love of one's homeplace, its\r\n\r\npeople,  and to the familiar things and scenes associated\r\n\r\nwith  the  homeplace.  The love should be  unconditional.\r\n\r\nSingapore is my home, good times or bad times.  It is  no\r\n\r\nwonder  that  home-making and homeland make  the  central\r\n\r\nthemes of many very moving poems, songs and stories.   In\r\n\r\nfact, I attended a choir performance last Saturday.   Out\r\n\r\nof  the  48 songs on the list I went through, 14 of  them\r\n\r\nactually were on either gu xiang (homeplace/homeland)  or\r\n\r\nzhu  guo (motherland).  So, I think we need to have  this\r\n\r\nsense of patriotism among our Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what type of patriotism? I think we must\r\n\r\ndifferentiate  that  from  nationalism.   Someone   -   I\r\n\r\ncannot remember who  -  said that patriotism arises  from\r\n\r\nthe  love  of your own people whereas nationalism  arises\r\n\r\nfrom  the hatred of other people.  But, in Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nare  a  country  that  consists of  different  races  and\r\n\r\ncultures.   We  must  have  a patriotism  that  could  be\r\n\r\napplicable  to  us.   Abraham  Lincoln's  definition   of\r\n\r\n\"patriotism\" could be aptly applied to our case.  He said\r\n\r\nthat,  \"Patriotism is not associated with any  particular\r\n\r\nrace  or  religion but the loyalty to a set of principles\r\n\r\nthat the country stands for.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, I think we should promote that and\r\n\r\nuphold our belief in meritocracy, equal opportunities for\r\n\r\nall,  multi-racialism,  multi-culturalism  and  the  able\r\n\r\nhelping the disabled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question, Sir, is how should we go about\r\n\r\npromoting  this.  I think we should do it in the  schools\r\n\r\nand in the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why schools? I think we have to start promoting\r\n\r\nthis sense of indebtedness, responsibility and patriotism\r\n\r\nwhen Singaporeans are still young.  Of course, it has  to\r\n\r\nstart at home also.  As the Chinese saying goes, san  sui\r\n\r\nding  zhong  sheng (your future is decided when  you  are\r\n\r\nthree  years  old).   And  every Singaporean  spends,  on\r\n\r\naverage,  maybe  10-15 years in the  educational  system.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  is  also the period when their characters  are\r\n\r\nformed  and  developed,  and  their  value  systems   are\r\n\r\ndeveloping.  We must not ask our students just  to  study\r\n\r\nand  study.   Like  the  comment of a  young  Singaporean\r\n\r\nduring  a  dialogue session, he said, \"If the  memory  of\r\n\r\nSingapore youths are limited to studying, they would  not\r\n\r\nhave much bonding with Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, what should be taught? Our students recite\r\n\r\nthe  National  Pledge and sing the National Anthem  every\r\n\r\nday.   We must ensure that what our system stands for  is\r\n\r\nactually enshrined in the Pledge and the Anthem.  So,  we\r\n\r\nshould make an effort to make sure that our children, our\r\n\r\nstudents,  really understand the meaning and buy  in  the\r\n\r\nvalues that are ingrained in them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member, Gan Kim Yong, has also proposed the\r\n\r\nrevamping  of  the  National Education programme,  and  I\r\n\r\nsupport  his call for that.  We should teach our National\r\n\r\nEducation on a more emotional level, and not just at  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of maybe recounting of historical facts.   We  may\r\n\r\neven want to structure the NEP to be more interactive and\r\n\r\nwith  more involvement.  And some of the assignments  may\r\n\r\nbe  done  with the parents and grandparents, so that  the\r\n\r\nmemories of the early generations can be passed on to the\r\n\r\nyounger generations through this programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In schools, I think we should also start teaching\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of  responsible citizenship since  young.   We\r\n\r\nmust,  as  I  said, inculcate the two senses I  mentioned\r\n\r\nsince  young.   And our youths must be  taught  what  the\r\n\r\nsystem stands for, what are the rights and obligations of\r\n\r\na  citizen, and let them know more about the Constitution\r\n\r\nand the needs of active citizen participation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a participatory citizenry? It should be one\r\n\r\nthat   involves   the  citizens  in  the  decision-making\r\n\r\nprocess.  And it must come with a mature attitude towards\r\n\r\nconsensus  building.  More often than  not,  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nlike to complain and say that their feedback is not being\r\n\r\nheard or not listened to because Government does not take\r\n\r\nthe  popular stand and follow what they have  asked  for.\r\n\r\nSo, I think it is also important to nurture this type  of\r\n\r\nmature  attitude to know that for Singapore  to  survive,\r\n\r\nsometimes  we  cannot  rule  by  popular  policies,   and\r\n\r\nsometimes we have to make tough and difficult policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, what is more important is that we must also\r\n\r\nnot   over-emphasise  the  importance  of   materialistic\r\n\r\nsuccess  at the expense of other basic human values.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to  place  more  emphasis on the  teaching  of  the\r\n\r\nhumanities, science, literature and arts.  These are  the\r\n\r\nsofter sciences that will help to inculcate the values of\r\n\r\nloyalty, honesty, responsibility and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I anticipate that the MOE may\r\n\r\nrespond by saying that our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncurriculum  is already so packed, how do we  add  in  all\r\n\r\nthis.   I think if we have to forgo some teaching of  the\r\n\r\nhard  subjects,  we may have to do it.   As  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying goes, shi nian shu mu, bai nian shu ren, (it takes\r\n\r\n10 years to grow a tree, it takes 100 years to build up a\r\n\r\npeople.)   Building  the character  of  our  students  is\r\n\r\ninvesting  in the future of our nation, and  is  building\r\n\r\nthe  foundation  of  our nation for tomorrow.   And  this\r\n\r\nshould take precedence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of bonding is to create a common\r\n\r\nmemory.  Culture, in its broader sense, makes up the bulk\r\n\r\nof  our  memories.  We have to therefore promote  culture\r\n\r\nand arts, both in school and community.  For this, we can\r\n\r\ndo it in the community also, not just in schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Singapore had been criticised as a\r\n\r\nplace where the development of culture and arts had  been\r\n\r\nsidelined.   But we have been doing  catching-up  in  the\r\n\r\npast  few  years, and much more can be  done.   Arts  and\r\n\r\nculture  must appeal to everyone.  We should not  promote\r\n\r\narts  and culture that appeal only to a certain group  of\r\n\r\npeople,  but  we  must  have one that  has  mass  appeal.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  as  we  aspire to become a truly  cosmopolitan\r\n\r\ncity,  we  also have to accept the introduction  and  the\r\n\r\nimpact of more varied forms of arts and culture that come\r\n\r\nalong  with  all the international talents  and  migrants\r\n\r\nthat  pass through Singapore.  The end result,  I  think,\r\n\r\nwould  definitely make us a more vibrant place  to  stay,\r\n\r\nand  this  will actually help to build the  memories  for\r\n\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we should not forget that every Singaporean will\r\n\r\nstill  have  a race of his own.  While we place  national\r\n\r\ninterest   above  one's  interest,  we  must  also   help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  have a deep sense of his  own  culture.\r\n\r\nOnly with a culture can a person have certain roots,  and\r\n\r\nwith  this  root,  it will help them  to  get  rooted  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And, of course, we should, besides  encourage\r\n\r\nthem  to  have  a deep sense of their own  culture,  also\r\n\r\nencourage them to understand others' culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, I feel that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nalso must help to promote\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nactive participation in the community.  Many things  have\r\n\r\nbeen  said  by other hon. Members before.   But  what  is\r\n\r\nimportant is whatever we do, it must always be done  with\r\n\r\nthis  objective  in mind.  This must  be  done  to  forge\r\n\r\ncommunity bonding and to build a national identity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clan associations, self-help groups, etc, could be\r\n\r\nroped  in  to  help to promote the righteous  traditional\r\n\r\nvalues.  For example, Confucian teachings stress a lot on\r\n\r\nloyalty  to  friends, family and the country,  and  these\r\n\r\nshould be promoted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ntouch  briefly on dual citizenship.  There are  pros  and\r\n\r\ncons   of  allowing  dual  citizenship.   The  advantages\r\n\r\ninclude   the  following:  maintaining  ties   with   the\r\n\r\ncitizens, promoting their economic contributions to  this\r\n\r\ncountry, encouraging their remittances back to Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  maybe we can help to develop a sympathetic lobby  in\r\n\r\nthe  countries that they have emigrated to.   However,  I\r\n\r\nsee that there are also many disadvantages of doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dual citizenship is like having two sets of parents\r\n\r\nor,  someone may like to say, two wives.  It is polygamy.\r\n\r\nWith one set of parents or one wife is already difficult.\r\n\r\nHow do you manage with two sets of parents with different\r\n\r\nbeliefs, psychology, values, and so on?  This will result\r\n\r\nin  divided loyalties.  Moreover, having dual citizenship\r\n\r\nalso  means  that we will permit immigrants  to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore to also hold dual citizenship and they may just\r\n\r\nbe   doing  likewise,  lobbying  for  their  home,  their\r\n\r\noriginating  country,  and  influence  our  politics   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, which may not be a wise thing to do.  Last but\r\n\r\nnot least, it really devalues the meaning of citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Chinese say, we must always give\r\n\r\npeople  a hou-lu.  So we must be like a forgiving mother,\r\n\r\nwelcome  and  embrace  our children  who  sometimes  have\r\n\r\nwandered off and decided to come home.  We may want to be\r\n\r\nmore  flexible and more forgiving in granting citizenship\r\n\r\nback  to those Singaporeans who choose to come back  with\r\n\r\ngood reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, sad will be\r\n\r\nthe day when Singaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforget  their history and values, and no longer  remember\r\n\r\nthe  country  that  nurtures  them,  the  land  that  our\r\n\r\nforefathers  had  fought and worked  so  hard  to  build.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am more optimistic.  Most Singaporeans are all-weather  citizens.  They are ready to sail the  Singapore\r\n\r\nship together, in good times and bad times!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion.  Based  on\r\n\r\nthe  wordings  of the Motion, I am sure  the  House  will\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Motion.  But, what will  happen  after  the\r\n\r\nMotion  is  passed  is the key consideration  in  today's\r\n\r\ndebate.   I  hope  the  Government  will  come  out  with\r\n\r\nconcrete  plans to review its policies and programmes  so\r\n\r\nas to develop a sense of belonging among Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would urge the Government to form an\r\n\r\ninter-agency committee comprising only civil servants  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  ways of bonding Singaporeans to our  country.\r\n\r\nThe  recommendations of this committee can complement the\r\n\r\nRemaking Singapore Committee's effort in going beyond the\r\n\r\n5Cs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that the Prime Minister has to raise\r\n\r\nsuch concerns clearly reflects that some Singaporeans are\r\n\r\ndisillusioned with Singapore.  There is a need to re-look\r\n\r\ninto the needs and aspirations of Singaporeans.  As human\r\n\r\nresource is the most valuable resource Singapore has,  we\r\n\r\nmust  make  very effort to root all Singaporeans  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   Any  Singaporean  who  emigrates  out  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry is a loss to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fast paced society like Singapore, economic\r\n\r\npursuits  may  sometimes make us lose  our  human  touch.\r\n\r\nIndividuals  and  families are subject  to  high  stress,\r\n\r\nresulting  in  people  losing hope  about  their  future.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, the search for greener pastures\r\n\r\nwill  surface, thus causing a brain drain to the country.\r\n\r\nWhile  Singapore  cannot relent on its pursuit  to  be  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive player in the global economy, we must at  the\r\n\r\nsame\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntime  inject hope in our people to lead a meaningful life\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must develop a conducive environment for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  live,  work  and  play  in   Singapore.\r\n\r\nSingapore  must be a place where there are  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor   all.    There   must  be  opportunities   for   all\r\n\r\nindividuals,  families,  community,  and  businesses   to\r\n\r\nflourish.  It must be a place for Singaporeans to live  a\r\n\r\nmeaningful and happy life.  It must also be a place where\r\n\r\nthere is hope for their future and future generations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to propose the following measures to\r\n\r\ndevelop a sense of belonging among Singaporeans:\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(1)  Housing Policies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 30 years, our housing policies and\r\n\r\nasset   enhancement  programmes  have  resulted  in   the\r\n\r\nnuclearisation  and high mobility of families.   The  HDB\r\n\r\nflat  allocation system is too rigid and does not provide\r\n\r\nmuch  option  for Singaporeans to stay near their  family\r\n\r\nmembers.  The resale flat policies also do not facilitate\r\n\r\nfamilies to live near one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the turnover of the sale of flats hampers\r\n\r\ncommunity   bonding   among   residents.    Today,   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are living away from their family  members.\r\n\r\nThis  physical divide, coupled with our busy  lifestyles,\r\n\r\nhas eroded the bonds of family members as they spend less\r\n\r\ntime  together.  Sir, we need a thorough  review  of  our\r\n\r\nhousing  policies to facilitate families to be  together.\r\n\r\nHDB  must  be  more  flexible  and  pro-family  in  their\r\n\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(2)  Education Policies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children are the future and hopes of all parents.\r\n\r\nParents  are  always concerned about  the  education  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  their children.  Lots of  feedback  have\r\n\r\nbeen  received  on  the  stressful  education  system  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Some parents have decided to emigrate for the\r\n\r\nsake of their children's future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many feel that our education policies do not provide\r\n\r\nmany  opportunities for their children to maximise  their\r\n\r\npotential.   Our  mainstream  education  system  is   too\r\n\r\ninflexible  and  lacks  choices for  students  to  choose\r\n\r\nsubjects  that  are  of  interest  to  them.   The  heavy\r\n\r\nemphasis on examination has also put too much pressure on\r\n\r\nour children unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents also face much difficulty in coping with\r\n\r\ntheir  children's  schoolwork.   Many  have  resorted  to\r\n\r\ntuitions, which have added much financial burden  to  the\r\n\r\nfamilies.   At the same time, children are  not  able  to\r\n\r\nfind enough time to play and interact with their friends.\r\n\r\nThis has made our children to be more individualistic and\r\n\r\nless street smart.  Some do not have any social skills at\r\n\r\nall, and can sometimes be rude and arrogant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to provide a more conducive learning\r\n\r\nenvironment for our children.  Our education system  must\r\n\r\nbe  more  compassionate  and flexible  in  nurturing  our\r\n\r\nyoung.   Although  we  need to  instill  values  such  as\r\n\r\ndiligence, creativity and moral conduct in our young,  we\r\n\r\nmust  help  them  to  balance their childhood  lives  and\r\n\r\nlearning  experiences.   Otherwise,  more  children   and\r\n\r\nparents will lose heart and fall out of the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(3)  Community Development Policies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop a sense of belonging, we need to focus on\r\n\r\nthe  hearts of our people.  The Government must take  the\r\n\r\nlead to show care and concern for its people.  We need to\r\n\r\nhelp  Singaporeans to find meaning in life.  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust  feel that they are useful to the society  and  must\r\n\r\nhave a sense of self-esteem to lead a meaningful life  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have done well in providing an excellent\r\n\r\nliving environment for Singaporeans.  What we need is  to\r\n\r\nlook  into the \"software\" of helping Singaporeans to live\r\n\r\nhappily  together.   Living close to family  members  and\r\n\r\nfriends  in  a cohesive community will provide  a  strong\r\n\r\nsense  of belonging to our people.  Furthermore, if there\r\n\r\nis a comprehensive network of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngrassroots and voluntary welfare organisations to support\r\n\r\nthe community, we can build a more caring community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should provide more resources to\r\n\r\nsupport  meaningful  programmes run  by  GROs  and  VWOs,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Community  Development  Councils.    More\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should be encouraged to help one another  in\r\n\r\nthe  community.  It is through these activities  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  build  strong bonds among our people and  develop  a\r\n\r\ntrue sense of belonging to the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(4)  Opportunities for All</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to make all Singaporeans \"stayers\", we\r\n\r\nmust  inject hope in our people, their families and their\r\n\r\nchildren.  We must make every Singaporean have the  \"feel\r\n\r\ngood\"  factor  of being in Singapore.  We must  formulate\r\n\r\nGovernment policies which will provide opportunities  for\r\n\r\nall.   Of  course,  we  shall still abide  by  our  equal\r\n\r\nopportunity and meritocracy principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those Singaporeans who have done well must be able\r\n\r\nto  see  more opportunities in the country.  While  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  not been too successful must see opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  themselves or their children in the future.  As long\r\n\r\nas  there is hope for every Singaporean, we will not face\r\n\r\nthe problem of quitters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  rise to support the Motion  dubbed  as\r\n\r\n\"Stayers   and   Quitters\"  raised  by  my   fellow   PAP\r\n\r\nparliamentarians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to tell you not the tale of two cities,\r\n\r\nbut the tale of two Singaporean families.  There are many\r\n\r\nstories  and anecdotes about this topic of migration  out\r\n\r\nthere,  but  I  feel  that  it is  important  for  me  to\r\n\r\nillustrate  how  complex this matter is.   Sometimes  the\r\n\r\nsituation that may be clear-cut and obvious to us may not\r\n\r\nbe  so.   These  are stories of Singaporean families  who\r\n\r\nhave   flirted  with  immigration  in  some   degree   of\r\n\r\nvariations and with different outcomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family A is a middle-aged professional couple with\r\n\r\nfour children.  Sometime in mid-1990s, the family decided\r\n\r\nto  go  to New Zealand, and they brought with them  their\r\n\r\ntwo  youngest children.  They made their living there and\r\n\r\neven  managed  to upgrade themselves and  obtained  their\r\n\r\npost-graduate degrees.  The two youngest children grew up\r\n\r\nand  studied  in the New Zealand education system,  while\r\n\r\nthe  other  two elder children stayed back in  Singapore,\r\n\r\ndid  very  well in their studies and were pursuing  their\r\n\r\ntertiary education (one in Singapore and the other in  an\r\n\r\noverseas  university).   After  four  years,  the  family\r\n\r\ndecided  to come back to Singapore.  But their  stay  was\r\n\r\nshort-lived, and they decided to uproot the family  again\r\n\r\nand migrate to New Zealand and maybe this time, it is for\r\n\r\ngood.  Why did this happen?  According to them, they  did\r\n\r\nit  for  their children.  It is because their two younger\r\n\r\nchildren  are  having problems to cope with our  academic\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family B is a young professional couple with two\r\n\r\nyoung  children.  For many years, the wife  and  the  two\r\n\r\nchildren stayed in Australia.  The kids were there  since\r\n\r\nthe  age  of  one  and  two.  The  husband  is  gainfully\r\n\r\nemployed  in  Singapore  and  shuttles  between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries  as  much  as  he can.   Recently,  the  family\r\n\r\ndecided  to come back and they are able to overcome  some\r\n\r\nof  the issues of the kids' education because the MOE had\r\n\r\ngiven  them  the  approval to put their  children  in  an\r\n\r\ninternational school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot under-estimate or emphasise enough\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of  the children's  education  in  their\r\n\r\ndecision-making process of these families.\r\n\r\nIn his National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Goh Chok\r\n\r\nTong  alerted us on his concern of the sense of belonging\r\n\r\nof  our  fellow  citizens.  This  concern  is  even  more\r\n\r\npertinent    with    regard   to   the   third-generation\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  We are hearing more who consider migration\r\n\r\nand  hope to find a less stressful place in the  sun  for\r\n\r\nthemselves  and their family.  These are generally  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  talented, mobile and can afford to  uproot  and\r\n\r\nmove.  Can we, as a country, afford this loss?  Some say,\r\n\r\n\"Good riddance.\"  But I am saying\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat,  for  a small country, like Singapore,  one  talent\r\n\r\nloss  is  one  too many.  As it is, we are struggling  to\r\n\r\nattract talent to our country.  Similarly, are we  taking\r\n\r\ncare  of  the  underdogs and the underprivileged  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety to face new challenges of this new economy?   How\r\n\r\nthen, Sir, can we allay all these worries that people are\r\n\r\nfacing?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe that we have\r\n\r\narrived at the juncture of our country's development  and\r\n\r\ngrowth   where  we  are  expected  to  deliver  something\r\n\r\ndifferent, do things differently and do not always  stick\r\n\r\nto  the  old formula that has served us well.  In  moving\r\n\r\nforward  to revive the economy, thus creating  more  jobs\r\n\r\nand businesses, we must not lose track of the very reason\r\n\r\nwe are doing all these efforts, that is, the people.  Let\r\n\r\nus give them back the self-confidence, the morale and the\r\n\r\nself-esteem.   We know that, in the present  scenario  of\r\n\r\nstiff  competition and rapid globalisation, we  certainly\r\n\r\nhave  to  put our priorities right, that is, to implement\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  ensure Singapore remains competitive.   But\r\n\r\ncan  we  also  emphasise  on  the  soft  aspects  of  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment, ie, our hearts and souls that will make  the\r\n\r\nsociety  and  country even stronger in the face  of  more\r\n\r\ndaunting challenges in the future?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expert advices and proposals from the Economic\r\n\r\nReview   Committee  on  Restructuring  our  Economy   are\r\n\r\nimportant.   But  equally  important  and  probably  more\r\n\r\nimportant  in this present climate, Sir, are  the  inputs\r\n\r\nand  proposals  from  the Remaking  Singapore  Committee.\r\n\r\nEver  so  often, our efficient Government prescribes  the\r\n\r\nmedicine  that  they  believe would  solve  the  economic\r\n\r\nmalaise.   These  are often bitter pills and  expect  the\r\n\r\npeople  to swallow.  I would also strongly encourage  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  take  heed  of  the  Remaking   Singapore\r\n\r\nCommittee's  proposals and recommendations that  will  be\r\n\r\ncoming up soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost a year since the last election and we\r\n\r\nare  slowly  recovering from the recession.  During  this\r\n\r\nperiod, we have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngone  through  many difficult challenges and  they  range\r\n\r\nfrom the economy and security of our beloved country, and\r\n\r\nI  am  sure we will continue to face more such challenges\r\n\r\nin  the  new economy and the ever changing political  and\r\n\r\nsecurity landscape of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the most important challenges for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is to ensure that the masses are  with  them.\r\n\r\nThey must understand that these changes are necessary and\r\n\r\nthat  we have to do it no matter how painful it is  going\r\n\r\nto be.  Without proper communication and understanding of\r\n\r\nwhat the Government is trying to achieve, I am afraid  we\r\n\r\nmay  be  creating many disgruntled citizens who  will  be\r\n\r\nbitter, cynical and anti-establishment.  This is  not  to\r\n\r\nmention the minimum sense of belonging towards Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe need to further improve what Mr Gan Kim Yong termed as\r\n\r\n\"connections\".  These links must provide  for  a  two-way\r\n\r\nchannel   of  communication.   The  Government  and   its\r\n\r\nagencies  must, in my opinion, take the lead in  changing\r\n\r\nand  adapting a different style of governance for the new\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  must  not  be  seen  as  always   giving\r\n\r\ndirections and taking a paternalistic role, but rather it\r\n\r\nmust  be  a  partner  of the people,  that  is,  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to abandon its \"Only Government  knows  best\"\r\n\r\nmindset.  We can tell the people to change their mindset.\r\n\r\nBut  is the Government willing to do the same in the  way\r\n\r\nit does things?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in this Motion, the call for Government to\r\n\r\nreview its policies and programmes thoroughly and to take\r\n\r\nmeaningful measures that will help strengthen  the  sense\r\n\r\nof  belonging to Singapore is timely and laudable.  There\r\n\r\nmust be clear indicators and not just lip service in  the\r\n\r\nway  our key institutions run their businesses.  They are\r\n\r\nwell  known for their efficiency and high standards.   It\r\n\r\nis   time  that  they  showed  the  same  high  level  of\r\n\r\ncompassion  and  humanity, if  not  cynical  remarks  and\r\n\r\nreviews  about  the  Government not  being  sincere  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to persist, and the able will not come  forward\r\n\r\nto  take  part in this process of change.   Let  us  work\r\n\r\ntogether to change this negative thinking and get as many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nable and willing citizens to participate in the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government's willingness\r\n\r\nto  change  its  mindset  will  be  a  bold  effort  but,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, a  necessary one.  We cannot afford to have\r\n\r\nour  strong and able simply leave to places or  countries\r\n\r\nwhich  they think can provide better for them  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.  Sir, this effort in our long journey of nation\r\n\r\nbuilding  is essential and all concerned members  of  our\r\n\r\nhomeland should be part of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in the long term, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust   also  accept  the  fact  that  there  must  be   a\r\n\r\nconstructive effort to lessen the reliance or  dependence\r\n\r\non  the  Government in all areas.  In the  same  vein,  I\r\n\r\nwould  also  say  that Singapore needs  to  readjust  its\r\n\r\nperception   and  perspective  on  law  and   punishment.\r\n\r\nSingapore should not be solely operated on laws and rules\r\n\r\nalone,  but  must  instead encourage  its  people  to  be\r\n\r\nresponsible and thinking citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight the importance of\r\n\r\neducation  in this process of change.  From the  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  my residents and grassroots, I have concluded  that\r\n\r\nmany  parents  are very concerned about their  children's\r\n\r\nfuture.   You  can see from the two stories that  I  have\r\n\r\ntold  you earlier.  The parents worry about whether their\r\n\r\nchildren   can   cope  with  the  extremely   competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment  in  Singapore.  Yes,  we  parents  are  very\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  our children's education.   We  are  so\r\n\r\nafraid  that  our  children will not  get  enough.   Some\r\n\r\ncynics  may  say otherwise.  But the majority does  agree\r\n\r\nthat we do have a good education system in Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve we can still fine-tune it to make it even better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose to MOE to put more resources\r\n\r\nand  emphasis on early childhood education, that is,  the\r\n\r\nfoundation  years.  Our education system  should  prepare\r\n\r\nthe  future generations for the rapid changes and produce\r\n\r\nnimble,  creative  and innovative  minds.   We  know  the\r\n\r\nimportance that the Government puts in education  by  the\r\n\r\nsheer size of resources\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  have  imported  into  education.   This  cannot  be\r\n\r\ndenied.   We  cannot afford not to invest in  our  young.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  we  should  have a more  holistic  approach\r\n\r\ntowards  education.  Academic excellence should not  only\r\n\r\nbe  the  thrust of education.  A child should be nurtured\r\n\r\non  values,  such  as community spirit,  social  service,\r\n\r\nvoluntarism  and sports and arts.  This would  nurture  a\r\n\r\nwell-rounded  individual  with  strong  community   ties.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  our education system should aim  to  develop\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  are  able to put Singapore  and  community\r\n\r\nbefore self.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new generation of Singaporeans is\r\n\r\ndifferent.  I think it is as expected.  This  is  due  to\r\n\r\nthe success of our past leaders, the rapid development of\r\n\r\nour country and - surprise - our education system itself.\r\n\r\nI  know  it  is  paradoxical that  most  of  our  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration   and   young  parents  are  complaining   and\r\n\r\ncriticising our stressful education system that  has,  in\r\n\r\nno small means, contributed to their own success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a sound meritocratic system which has\r\n\r\nproduced   a   society  of  achievers  and   success-only\r\n\r\nproducts,  with  little  room for  failures  and  errors.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have also been moulded to be conformists and\r\n\r\nuniformists.  We are now faced with difficulties to allow\r\n\r\nand,   let   alone,  encourage  creativity  and  bohemian\r\n\r\nlifestyle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore needs to accept other avenues of\r\n\r\nsuccess,    meaning   non-academic   success,   different\r\n\r\nlifestyles,  being non-conformists, and  entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nwith  tolerance  for failures.  We should allow,  promote\r\n\r\nand  encourage  pluralism and diversity of  opinions  and\r\n\r\nviews.   I believe it is the basic tenet of our existence\r\n\r\nin a multi-racial and multi-religious society.  We should\r\n\r\nbe as inclusive as possible and avoid being exclusive and\r\n\r\nelitist in our approach.  Every Singaporean matters,  and\r\n\r\nwe should re-emphasise this notion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, Singaporeans and the Government\r\n\r\nalike  need  to  acknowledge there are other  avenues  of\r\n\r\nmeritocracy   and   talents   whilst   maintaining    the\r\n\r\nfundamentals of these two policies.

Our businessmen have been  positioning\r\n\r\nthemselves to take advantage of the many opportunities in\r\n\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them have done well in China. For example,\r\n\r\nKhong Guan sold 300 million yuan (S$67 million) worth  of\r\n\r\nits  products  in  China last year.   Education  services\r\n\r\nprovider  TMC has attracted 1,000 full-time  students  in\r\n\r\nits  Xi'an  campus alone, thanks to its modern facilities\r\n\r\nand  high quality courses.  Smart Garments has grown from\r\n\r\n280  workers  in 1985 to 2,600 workers in its  3  Chinese\r\n\r\nfactories today, producing 1.75 million suits a year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides investing in China, our companies have also\r\n\r\nbegun  to  partner with Chinese companies  that  are  now\r\n\r\nseeking  to internationalise, in exploring other markets.\r\n\r\nFor  example, one of our local companies has successfully\r\n\r\npartnered Zhejiang-based Feiyue Sewing Machine  Group  to\r\n\r\nenter the India market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Programmes and Plans</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are steadily building up our China network. It\r\n\r\nis  impossible  to  do  business in  China  without  good\r\n\r\nnetworking. Last month, we launched the Singapore Chamber\r\n\r\nof  Commerce  and  Industry in Beijing (SingCham).  This,\r\n\r\ntogether   with  Network  China  that  was  launched   in\r\n\r\nSingapore a year ago by DPM Lee Hsien Loong and  Chairman\r\n\r\nof the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference\r\n\r\nLi  Ruihuan, will provide a useful platform for companies\r\n\r\noperating  in  China  to  network,  interact  and   share\r\n\r\nexperiences  and  business ideas.  SingCham  and  Network\r\n\r\nChina  provide  a  support base for  Singapore  companies\r\n\r\noperating in China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When PRC Vice President Hu Jintao visited Singapore\r\n\r\nin  April,  he  raised  a 4-Point Proposal  with  PM,  to\r\n\r\ncooperate   with   Singapore  in  (i)   helping   Chinese\r\n\r\nenterprises  to  go global, (ii) high-tech  areas,  (iii)\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  Western China and  (iv)  human  resource\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April, we have been working on these 4\r\n\r\nproposals with the Chinese Government.  EDB recently  set\r\n\r\nup  a new office in Shanghai to attract Chinese companies\r\n\r\nto Singapore.  China's Ministry of Science and Technology\r\n\r\nhas  announced  its plans to set up an innovation  centre\r\n\r\nfor  China's high-tech enterprises in Singapore.   During\r\n\r\nmy  recent  visit to China, the Zhejiang  provincial  and\r\n\r\ncity  governments reacted positively to our proposal  for\r\n\r\nthe establishment of a Zhejiang Centre in Singapore, as a\r\n\r\nfacility  for Zhejiang companies to market, showcase  and\r\n\r\nprovide after-sales service for their products in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregion.  In Brunei recently, I also discussed the idea of\r\n\r\na  China  Centre with Chinese Minister for Foreign  Trade\r\n\r\nand  Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng to help  Chinese\r\n\r\ncompanies  use  Singapore as a base  to  regionalise  and\r\n\r\ninternationalise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have relaxed our visa policies to facilitate the\r\n\r\nflow of Chinese tourists into Singapore, and PRC business\r\n\r\ntravellers can now obtain multiple-journey visas  for  up\r\n\r\nto 5 years.  We are also interested to participate in the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  Western China.   Minister  Mah  Bow  Tan\r\n\r\nvisited  Sichuan  in  May  this year,  and  IE  Singapore\r\n\r\norganised 2 business missions to Western China last  year\r\n\r\nfocusing  on  education and ICT.  We are discussing  with\r\n\r\nour Chinese counterparts on ways to operationalise VP  Hu\r\n\r\nJintao's proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, ASEAN is negotiating a Free Trade\r\n\r\nAgreement  with  China within 10 years, and  a  Framework\r\n\r\nAgreement  incorporating an Early Harvest is expected  to\r\n\r\nbe  signed  when  the Leaders meet in November  in  Phnom\r\n\r\nPenh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector is the prime mover in seeking out\r\n\r\nbusiness  opportunities in China.   The  Government  will\r\n\r\nplay a supportive role.  One area that the Government can\r\n\r\nhelp is in manpower training. Since I announced the Asian\r\n\r\nBusiness  Fellowship Programme a year ago, more  than  50\r\n\r\nfresh  graduates and young executives have been  sent  on\r\n\r\ntraining  attachments with companies in various parts  of\r\n\r\nChina  under  the  Programme.  We expect  the  number  of\r\n\r\ntrainees to reach 100 by the end of this year.  Recently,\r\n\r\nIE  Singapore launched its Overseas Manpower  Program  to\r\n\r\nequip  executives with overseas experience in  China  and\r\n\r\nelsewhere.   Through such initiatives, we  hope  to  make\r\n\r\navailable  a  pool  of Singaporeans  with  deep  business\r\n\r\nknowledge of China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mdm Ho suggested, the window of opportunity for\r\n\r\nour  engagement  with China will not be as  open  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   Our  companies can and should leverage  on  our\r\n\r\ngood  relations with China and our reputation for honesty\r\n\r\nand  reliability.   But  we have to  keep  upgrading  our\r\n\r\ncapabilities,  so that we do not lose our relevance.   At\r\n\r\nthe same time, we must be aware of the pitfalls.  Not all\r\n\r\nour  companies have done well in China and we should also\r\n\r\nlearn from their experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PREVENTION OF HEAT BUILD-UP IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  (a)  what  are the  measures  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nplanning and building authorities to prevent the build up\r\n\r\nof  heat  in our built environment; and (b) what are  the\r\n\r\nenergy   conservation   measures   taken   to   encourage\r\n\r\nsustainable development in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the planning of the physical development of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   the   Government   has   always   emphasised\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and integrated efforts to provide shade and\r\n\r\ngreenery  to  our urban built environment.    Our  Garden\r\n\r\nCity  initiative has succeeded in providing  a  pervasive\r\n\r\ngarden  environment for Singapore.  Our  roadside  trees,\r\n\r\nthe  planned parks and green spaces provide the necessary\r\n\r\ngreen  lungs  and  aesthetics as  well  as  work  towards\r\n\r\nameliorating the heat build up in our environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BCA, NParks, HDB and NUS are jointly studying the\r\n\r\ncauses and impact of heat build up in our environment. So\r\n\r\nfar,  the study has shown that rooftop gardens can almost\r\n\r\nhalve  the temperatures of the roof surfaces of  highrise\r\n\r\nbuildings,  resulting  in  less  heat  radiated  to   the\r\n\r\nsurrounding areas. NParks is therefore promoting  rooftop\r\n\r\ngardens to owners and developers through public education\r\n\r\nand awareness programmes.  To encourage skyrise greenery,\r\n\r\nURA allows for certain GFA exemption for the provision of\r\n\r\nsky  terrace.  URA  also  allows  developers  to  provide\r\n\r\nbalcony  floor  area up to 10% above  the  GFA  allowable\r\n\r\nunder the Master Plan in the design of residential, mixed\r\n\r\nresidential and hotel developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance the energy efficiency of buildings in\r\n\r\nSingapore, BCA has set more stringent standards to reduce\r\n\r\nthe energy consumption of building services. These are in\r\n\r\nareas   such  as  the  design  of  air-conditioning   and\r\n\r\nmechanical ventilation systems and the minimum efficiency\r\n\r\nof  equipment and lighting systems in buildings. BCA also\r\n\r\nintends  to set a stricter compliance value of  the  heat\r\n\r\ngain  into  a  building which is to be incorporated  into\r\n\r\nbuilding  designs. This will lessen the load on the  air-conditioning  system in new buildings and therefore  help\r\n\r\nreduce the electricity consumption. In addition, BCA  has\r\n\r\nstarted the Building Energy Efficiency Indices (EEI) as a\r\n\r\nguide  to  the industry for the amount of energy consumed\r\n\r\nby  the  various  building types.  It is also  conducting\r\n\r\nresearch on the use of solar energy in our local context.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  whether his Ministry will review Article  122(1)\r\n\r\nof  the  Constitution of the Republic of Singapore making\r\n\r\nthe  conditions  for according Singapore  citizenship  by\r\n\r\ndescent  to  foreign born children of a Singapore  parent\r\n\r\nmore gender equal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Constitution does not make any distinction\r\n\r\nbetween a child born in Singapore to either a Singaporean\r\n\r\nfather   or   Singaporean  mother.   Such  children   are\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens by birth.  This would apply  to  most\r\n\r\ncases,  as the majority of children born to a Singaporean\r\n\r\nparent or parents, are born in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Constitution also provides for children born\r\n\r\noverseas to at least one Singaporean parent to be granted\r\n\r\ncitizenship.   Children born overseas  to  a  Singaporean\r\n\r\nmother  (and  foreigner father) are  not  deprived  of  a\r\n\r\nchance to be citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 122(1) of the Constitution allows for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  by  descent to be granted to  a  child  born\r\n\r\noverseas to a Singaporean father, provided that the child\r\n\r\nis   registered  within  one  year  of  birth.   If   the\r\n\r\nregistration  is not done within one year of  birth,  the\r\n\r\nConstitution allows for citizenship by registration to be\r\n\r\ngranted to such children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 124 of the Constitution allows for children\r\n\r\nborn  overseas  of  a Singaporean mother  (and  foreigner\r\n\r\nfather) to be citizens by registration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Constitution has made this\r\n\r\ndifferentiation for births overseas, the practical effect\r\n\r\nis  not  great.   The great majority of applications  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  of children born overseas to  a  Singaporean\r\n\r\nparent are approved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other discernible difference between\r\n\r\ncitizenship  by  descent and citizenship by  registration\r\n\r\nlies  in  Article  129(3)(b) of the  Constitution,  which\r\n\r\nstates that the Government may deprive the citizenship of\r\n\r\na citizen by registration if, within 5 years of the grant\r\n\r\nof  citizenship by registration, he has been sentenced to\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term of more than 1 year or to a  fine\r\n\r\nof  more  than  $5,000  or  if he  has  been  engaged  in\r\n\r\nactivities  which  are prejudicial  to  the  security  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  or  the  maintenance  of  public   order   or\r\n\r\nessential   services,  or  in  any  criminal   activities\r\n\r\nprejudicial to the interests of public safety,  peace  or\r\n\r\ngood  order.  For  most  people,  these  conditions   are\r\n\r\npractically not applicable.  Thus, while the form of  the\r\n\r\ncitizenship  differs between a child born overseas  to  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean   father  and  mother,   the   substance   is\r\n\r\npractically the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not the only country to make such a\r\n\r\ndistinction.   We  are guided by the reasoning  that,  in\r\n\r\ncommunities like ours, the man is traditionally the  main\r\n\r\nor  in  many  cases, the sole breadwinner of the  family.\r\n\r\nThe  man's  place  of employment would therefore  usually\r\n\r\ndecide where the family would reside.  It would therefore\r\n\r\nbe  more practical for the citizenship of the child  born\r\n\r\noverseas to follow that of the father's.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the substance of the citizenship granted to\r\n\r\nchildren born overseas in either case is practically  the\r\n\r\nsame, my Ministry is of the view that, for now, we should\r\n\r\nnot amend Article 122(1) of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
