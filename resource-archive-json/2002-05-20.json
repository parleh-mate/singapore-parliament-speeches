Currently,  we  have  approved   five   Western\r\n\r\nsynthetic  drugs for treatment of obesity in Singapore.   Due\r\n\r\nto  the presence of generics, these five approved drugs  come\r\n\r\nin eight brands.  These medicines are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffective but can only be prescribed by doctors as  they  may\r\n\r\nsometimes have serious side-effects.  Such medicines are used\r\n\r\nin   the   short-term  treatment  of  obese  individuals   in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  an  overall  weight-loss  programme  under\r\n\r\nmedical supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All synthetic medicines, commonly known as Western\r\n\r\nmedicines,  are  stringently  evaluated  by  HSA  for   their\r\n\r\nquality,  safety  and efficacy before marketing  approval  is\r\n\r\ngranted.   After  marketing approval has been granted,  these\r\n\r\nproducts  are  subjected to post-marketing surveillance  that\r\n\r\nincludes quality compliance testing and Adverse Drug Reaction\r\n\r\nmonitoring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these synthetic pharmaceuticals, there are a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  other products, ranging from Chinese  proprietary\r\n\r\nmedicines (CPM) and health supplements to other complementary\r\n\r\nor  traditional medicines, which are promoted as being useful\r\n\r\nfor  weight  reduction.  These claims cannot be evaluated  by\r\n\r\nHSA  since rigorous scientific data to validate efficacy  and\r\n\r\nbenefits are generally not available.  Instead, such products\r\n\r\nare  regulated  on  the basis of safety and  quality  of  the\r\n\r\nproduct.  This is a risk-based approach that is in line  with\r\n\r\nthe  systems  adopted  by regulatory  agencies  in  developed\r\n\r\ncountries like the US, UK and Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to synthetic pharmaceuticals, traditional and\r\n\r\ncomplementary  medicines  are  generally  considered  to   be\r\n\r\nrelatively less toxic, because they usually comprise herbs in\r\n\r\nlow individual concentrations and, in the case of traditional\r\n\r\nmedicines,  because of long historical usage.   However,  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  processes may result in contamination  of  the\r\n\r\nproducts with toxic heavy metals and micro-organisms, or  the\r\n\r\nproducts may be adulterated with Western medicines.  In  view\r\n\r\nof  this,  for CPM, the main group of complementary  medicine\r\n\r\nremedies  used  in Singapore, HSA's system is more  stringent\r\n\r\nthan  that  of  the  US and UK which do not  have  pre-market\r\n\r\nassessment of CPM products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, control measures to ensure that CPM meet\r\n\r\nappropriate quality\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand safety standards comprise the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the licensing of CPM dealers - importers,\r\n\r\nwholesalers,  manufacturers  and  re-packers  -   to   ensure\r\n\r\naccountability for the safety and quality of their products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, pre-market product assessment to ensure that\r\n\r\nproducts  are  from licensed manufacturers,  sold  freely  in\r\n\r\ncountry  of  origin,  do  not contain  Western  medicines  or\r\n\r\nnaturally  occurring toxic substances, and that  heavy  toxic\r\n\r\nmetals,  such  as  mercury, arsenic,  lead  and  copper,  and\r\n\r\nmicrobial counts are within permissible limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, submission of test reports and written\r\n\r\ndeclaration of the absence of any synthetic drugs or  poisons\r\n\r\nas  defined in the Poisons Act by the licensed importers  for\r\n\r\nevery consignment imported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four, approved product labelling in English to clearly\r\n\r\nspecify the ingredients, indications for use, dosages,  batch\r\n\r\nnumber,  expiry  date and the identity of the  importers  and\r\n\r\nmanufacturers.  Labels and packages must not stipulate any of\r\n\r\nthe 19 diseases or conditions specified in the First Schedule\r\n\r\nof   the   Medicines  Act,  such  as  cancer,  diabetes   and\r\n\r\nhypertension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is any doubt on the documents submitted by\r\n\r\nthe   applicants,  product  samples  are  tested   by   HSA's\r\n\r\nlaboratories  to exclude suspected adulterants,  and  analyse\r\n\r\ntoxic heavy metals and microbial contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently no licensing requirements for the\r\n\r\nimport, manufacture and sale of health supplements and  other\r\n\r\ntraditional  remedies  like Jamu and Ayurvedic  preparations,\r\n\r\nbut  dealers are required to ensure that the products do  not\r\n\r\ncontain  any prohibited substances and the toxic heavy  metal\r\n\r\ncontent does not exceed legally permissible limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HSA also carries out regular post-marketing surveillance\r\n\r\nand  runs a quality-testing programme on products sold in the\r\n\r\nmarket to ensure compliance with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegal  requirements.  HSA also has an Adverse  Drug  Reaction\r\n\r\n(ADR)  Monitoring System to detect any adverse  reactions  of\r\n\r\nproducts used in Singapore, and this is tied to international\r\n\r\nADR networks to pick up early signals and intelligence on any\r\n\r\nproblems with health products.  Health care professionals are\r\n\r\nrequested   to   report  suspected  adverse  drug   reactions\r\n\r\nencountered  to  HSA so that unsafe products can  be  removed\r\n\r\nfrom the market as and when they surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, synthetic pharmaceuticals for weight\r\n\r\nloss  can  only  be used under a doctor's supervision.  Where\r\n\r\nconsumers are considering self-medication with other products\r\n\r\nthat claim to cause weight loss, they have to be cautious and\r\n\r\ndiscerning  and  exercise care in the selection  and  use  of\r\n\r\nthese products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HSA will look into how the labelling of complementary\r\n\r\nand  alternative medicines can help the public to make better\r\n\r\ninformed  choices  as to whether to use a health  product  or\r\n\r\nnot.   HSA  will  also  review  and  refine  regulations  and\r\n\r\nguidelines  governing slimming products to ensure safety  for\r\n\r\nusers.   HSA is developing a regulatory framework for  health\r\n\r\nsupplements, targeted for implementation in phases from 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  the Slim 10 product, I understand that the  routine\r\n\r\nlaboratory  tests discovered the presence of  two  controlled\r\n\r\nsubstances, nicotinamide and fenfluramine, after the  product\r\n\r\nhad  been put on the market.  My question to the Minister  is\r\n\r\nwhy  can the tests not be conducted before the product is put\r\n\r\non sale and, in the case of Slim 10, why was it allowed to be\r\n\r\nsold for five months before any action was taken by HSA?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me go through\r\n\r\nthe process of how Slim 10 came in. Slim 10 was imported from\r\n\r\nChina, and for the ingredients declared by the company,  they\r\n\r\nclaimed that the product contained five common Chinese herbs,\r\n\r\nwith dosages within those recommended in the official Chinese\r\n\r\npharmacy literature.  So this product was, therefore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclassified  as Chinese proprietary medicine.  HSA  had  these\r\n\r\nproducts tested and found that they were indeed based on  the\r\n\r\ntea leaves and the Chinese herbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that basis, they were allowed to come in. Each time\r\n\r\na  consignment comes in, the importer has to declare that the\r\n\r\nconsignment does not include any of the items in the  Poisons\r\n\r\nAct  and  that the product does not have any toxic metals  or\r\n\r\nmicrobial  contents exceeding the legal requirements.   Based\r\n\r\non  those declarations, they were allowed to be sold.   Then,\r\n\r\nas  I  have  explained  earlier, HSA runs  the  Adverse  Drug\r\n\r\nReaction  Monitoring System and, based  on  that  system,  in\r\n\r\nearly April, HSA received reports from doctors about patients\r\n\r\nwith serious adverse drug reactions.  So HSA went to test the\r\n\r\nproduct from the shelf and discovered that there were  indeed\r\n\r\nthese  adulterants in these batches.  So HSA took  action  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw these samples.  That is how the issue became public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to say is that for Chinese proprietary\r\n\r\nmedicine,  the  procedure is, first,  anybody  who  wants  to\r\n\r\nimport a Chinese proprietary medicine submits the application\r\n\r\nto  HSA  and tells HSA what the product contains.   HSA  will\r\n\r\ntest  the  product  and  make sure that  the  product  is  as\r\n\r\ndeclared.   On  that basis, HSA will allow it in.   On  every\r\n\r\nconsignment, the importer will then have a declaration to say\r\n\r\nthat  the consignment of the product coming in does not  have\r\n\r\nany  of the items in the Poisons Act, does not have any heavy\r\n\r\nmetals or any microbial contents above the legal limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible for HSA itself to test the items\r\n\r\nbecause, as you can appreciate, the CPM is a very wide  range\r\n\r\nand,  therefore, we use the regulatory regime of  making  the\r\n\r\nimporter declare that whatever they bring in is in accordance\r\n\r\nwith what they indicate as ingredients, and that they do  not\r\n\r\nhave  any  of the poisons in the Poisons Act and any  of  the\r\n\r\nother toxic heavy metals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, why can the laboratory tests not\r\n\r\nbe taken when the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimporter submits the declaration at the same time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have explained, this is not a\r\n\r\nsynthetic  pharmaceutical.  For the  Chinese  medicine,  they\r\n\r\nclaimed  that these are the ingredients in it.  HSA can  test\r\n\r\nthat  indeed  these  ingredients are there,  but  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible for HSA to test what else is not there.  We will  be\r\n\r\ntesting for a lot of things.  We can test for the poisons, we\r\n\r\ncan test for a few toxic metals, but they could be putting in\r\n\r\na lot of other things, eg, steroids, all kinds of adulterants\r\n\r\nin  it.  So it is not possible for HSA to put upon itself the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  testing  what  is  not  declared  by  the\r\n\r\nimporter, because you do not know what to look for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give another analogy. When I was in charge of\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  National  Development  and  we   imported\r\n\r\nvegetables from Malaysia and we had this problem of pesticide\r\n\r\nresidue.   We  could impose a very strict regime because  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of known pesticides used is limited and we  can  test\r\n\r\nfor  the  10 or 15 pesticides and make sure that the  residue\r\n\r\ndoes  not  exceed the level that we set.  Therefore,  we  can\r\n\r\nhave  a  very  tough system in testing every consignment  for\r\n\r\nthose  10  or  15 pesticides and make sure that it  does  not\r\n\r\nexceed the residue level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we come to Chinese medicine, we do not have a\r\n\r\nsimilar  list of things we can say that you cannot put  these\r\n\r\nin  the Chinese medicine.  We can have a list of the poisons,\r\n\r\nbut  they will be put in steroids and all kinds of stuff, and\r\n\r\nthey  may put in things which are above the safe dosage.   So\r\n\r\nit  will  be  very  difficult for us to  do  tests  on  every\r\n\r\nconsignment  and  to  test  for  what  is  not  declared   as\r\n\r\ningredients in Chinese medicine.  That is why in  1999,  when\r\n\r\nwe  were  looking  at  how to regulate Chinese  medicine,  we\r\n\r\ndecided that it is not possible for the HSA to license  every\r\n\r\nproduct  and  every  consignment.   Therefore,  we  put   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility on the importer, the wholesaler, to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  whatever  they  bring in they  must  declare  that  the\r\n\r\nproduct  they bring in does not have the items in the Poisons\r\n\r\nAct,  do  not have heavy metals, and the ingredients  of  the\r\n\r\nproduct are clearly labelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, may I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister whether the Ministry has any plans  to  control\r\n\r\nother  slimming treatments, such as the use of equipment  for\r\n\r\nslimming,  the use of slimming oil and body wraps,  and  also\r\n\r\nwhether  the Ministry will help CASE to investigate into  all\r\n\r\nthose complaints on slimming treatment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The whole issue of medical devices is\r\n\r\ncurrently  not  regulated, and we intend to regulate  medical\r\n\r\ndevices  when we put up legislation towards the end  of  this\r\n\r\nyear  or  next  year.

The HSA's stand is to\r\n\r\nregulate this stringently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of the spectrum, when it is Chinese\r\n\r\nmedicine,  because these are herbs and plants, and these  are\r\n\r\ntraditional  medicine which have been in use for hundreds  of\r\n\r\nyears  and  proven to be reasonably safe, we have to  take  a\r\n\r\ndifferent approach.  Unfortunately, the problem now  is  that\r\n\r\nmany  people  bring  in Chinese medicine  but  actually  they\r\n\r\nadulterate it with Western medicine, and they come  in  under\r\n\r\nthe  guise of pure Chinese medicine.  This is the middle area\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  to review and make sure that even  though  we\r\n\r\ncannot  regulate the efficacy, we must regulate  for  safety,\r\n\r\nand that is the intention that we set out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, I was a bit surprised by the\r\n\r\nMinister's  answer.

Sometimes, even after\r\n\r\nsuch  a  stringent  process, you do  come  across  unexpected\r\n\r\nadverse  drug reactions.  Even for synthetic pharmaceuticals,\r\n\r\nyou get products being withdrawn because some of these after-effects were not encountered during the clinical trials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is that even at this end of the\r\n\r\nspectrum,  where we have such a strict regime, together  with\r\n\r\nthe   western   countries,  we  also  have  unexpected   drug\r\n\r\nreactions,  and through this Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring\r\n\r\nSystem,  we  have  to pull products out.  When  you  look  at\r\n\r\nChinese medicine at the other end of the spectrum, generally,\r\n\r\nwe   do   not  face  this  problem  because  these  are   low\r\n\r\nconcentrations which have been used for a long time,  through\r\n\r\nhistorical  and  traditional use,  the  adverse  reaction  is\r\n\r\nminimal.  When we come to the middle area, this is where  the\r\n\r\nproblem arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained just now, we cannot adopt wholesale the\r\n\r\nWestern medicine approach of regulating it, in line with what\r\n\r\nother  countries do.  In the US, for example, when they  come\r\n\r\nto   traditional  medicine  or  complementary  medicine,  the\r\n\r\napproach  is that you take it at your own risk. FDA does  not\r\n\r\nregulate.   If  you  take  traditional  medicine  or  Chinese\r\n\r\nmedicine, it is entirely at your own risk.  In Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nrealise  we  cannot  adopt  that hands-off  approach  because\r\n\r\ntraditional medicine or Chinese medicine has a wide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfollowing in Singapore.  Since 1994 and then in 1999, we have\r\n\r\nput  in  place  a  system which tries to address  the  unique\r\n\r\ncharacteristics of Chinese proprietary medicine and,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, put in some safeguards.  One of the safeguards, as\r\n\r\nexplained  earlier,  is when somebody wants  to  bring  in  a\r\n\r\nproduct,  HSA  tests the product and makes sure  that  it  is\r\n\r\nqualified  under  Chinese medicine, and not Western  medicine\r\n\r\ndisguising as Chinese medicine.  Having allowed the  importer\r\n\r\nto  bring it in, we make sure that for each consignment,  the\r\n\r\nimporter declares that whatever he brings in has the  minimum\r\n\r\nsafety standards of not having poisons or heavy metals in it.\r\n\r\nWhat  happens  in  some of these cases is  that  the  quality\r\n\r\ncontrol  in the manufacturing of these products in  China  is\r\n\r\nnot   tight   and   sometimes,  it  gets  adulterated.    The\r\n\r\nlaboratories  that  test  these products  are  not  stringent\r\n\r\nenough,  so  it  gets through the net.  We are reviewing  the\r\n\r\nsystem.   One of the things that we may consider is  to  only\r\n\r\naccredit qualified laboratories to make sure that the testing\r\n\r\nis  done by certified laboratories, and not just laboratories\r\n\r\nfrom  different parts of China.  This is one of the  measures\r\n\r\nthat we are considering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our objective is to ensure safety but if it is\r\n\r\nprescription-only medicine, we have a higher level of  safety\r\n\r\nbecause  there are more checks, the doctor is  in  charge  of\r\n\r\nprescribing  it, we ensure that the pharmaceutical  companies\r\n\r\nwhich  manufacture them have good manufacturing certificates,\r\n\r\nso  there  are  more  stringent checks.   When  it  comes  to\r\n\r\ntraditional medicine, I am afraid that the regulatory  regime\r\n\r\nis  quite different, as practised everywhere else.  There are\r\n\r\na  lot  of grey areas, whether it is medical devices,  health\r\n\r\nsupplements  or  food products, they are now coming  in  with\r\n\r\ndifferent claims.  It is very difficult for us to say that  a\r\n\r\nfood   product  cannot  be  adulterated.   If  somebody  puts\r\n\r\nadulterants  into food products and thinks he  can  get  away\r\n\r\nwith  it,  unless you go round checking every item and  every\r\n\r\nconsignment,  there  is  no  way we  can  prevent  that  from\r\n\r\nhappening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, it seems\r\n\r\nthat the present procedure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoes  not seem to have worked because Slim 10 has got in  and\r\n\r\nhas  caused  harm to the people.  May I ask three  questions?\r\n\r\nFirstly,  could  I ask the Minister to review  the  procedure\r\n\r\nwhereby  in  the  first instance, although  an  importer  may\r\n\r\ndeclare  certain substances, he will not be so stupid  as  to\r\n\r\ndeclare  disallowed items, so he probably  declares  all  the\r\n\r\nallowed items.  Could the Ministry consider asking the HSA to\r\n\r\nconduct  limited testing of other disallowed products because\r\n\r\nif  the product, for example, is for slimming, they can  test\r\n\r\nthe limited range of products that are used for such effects,\r\n\r\nbut  maybe  not allowed for health reasons?  At  least,  that\r\n\r\nwill help to give better protection to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, after the products are allowed to come in,\r\n\r\nwhen  the products are being sent in by batches, to do  batch\r\n\r\ntesting of the products.  At least, they are being tested and\r\n\r\nmonitored regularly by batch testing through the HSA  getting\r\n\r\nsamples from each batch being imported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is: if deterrence is the way the\r\n\r\nMinistry  wants to go about doing it, then what is the  level\r\n\r\nof  deterrence we are having now?  For example, what kind  of\r\n\r\npenalty  do  we  impose  on  these defaulter  importers,  and\r\n\r\nwhether this can be reviewed as a procedure?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the\r\n\r\nsentiments  of some of the Members here that even though  our\r\n\r\nprocedures are stricter than in UK or US and about  the  same\r\n\r\nas  Australia,  because  of  the widespread  use  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nproprietary medicine in Singapore, we ought to re-look at the\r\n\r\nprocedures  and see how we can tighten this up.  We  are,  in\r\n\r\nfact, doing this review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I do not want to give the House the\r\n\r\nwrong  impression that whatever we come up, it  is  going  to\r\n\r\nensure  100% safety.  I think we can improve, but it  is  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  such products. I have many meetings  with  Health\r\n\r\nMinisters  from the region.  When I meet the Health  Minister\r\n\r\nfrom Taiwan or Hong Kong and we discuss the problems we face,\r\n\r\nthis  is quite a widespread problem in Taiwan and Hong  Kong,\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  bring in Chinese proprietary medicine.  So, we are  all\r\n\r\ngrappling with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, with regard to Mr Leong Horn Kee's\r\n\r\nsuggestion,  we  will  take this up.  We  do  conduct  random\r\n\r\ntesting.  HSA does not have the resources to test every batch\r\n\r\nand  everything  that  comes in.   But  HSA  will  do  random\r\n\r\ntesting,  and we indeed do that as part of our post-marketing\r\n\r\nsurveillance mechanism.  Mr Leong also suggests  that  we  do\r\n\r\nbatch testing.  We will review that but it means we are going\r\n\r\nto  slow down and, in fact, it will affect the trade  and  it\r\n\r\nwill raise costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the bulk of the Chinese medicine that comes in, the\r\n\r\nherbs and grasses are fairly innocuous.  They have been  used\r\n\r\nfor  hundreds of years and they are reasonably safe.  But  if\r\n\r\nan  importer wants to adulterate such stuff, then it is  very\r\n\r\nhard  for us to prevent them from doing so.  We must  have  a\r\n\r\nregime  that  does not penalise the bona fide  importer.   We\r\n\r\ncannot treat every importer as a possible crook.  But I agree\r\n\r\nwith Mr Leong that we must have in place a regime that deters\r\n\r\nand  which can ferret out those who are unscrupulous.  As far\r\n\r\nas deterrence is concerned, our present Act allows for a two-year  jail  sentence for those who bring in items  which  are\r\n\r\nadulterated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, I have three questions. First,\r\n\r\nif HSA does not have the resources to test everything that is\r\n\r\nimported,  can  this  work be done by  private  laboratories?\r\n\r\nSecond,  in  the  case  of Slim 10,  I  understand  that  the\r\n\r\ndecision  by HSA to ban Slim 10 was made on 15th April.   Why\r\n\r\nwas the public informed of the ban through press release only\r\n\r\non  30th April?  Why was there a wait of two weeks?  My  last\r\n\r\nquestion:   is  there a way for HSA to inform the  public  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as it is possible of dangerous drugs, instead of having\r\n\r\nto wait, as in this case, for two weeks?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, this is the\r\n\r\ncurrent  regime.   We  try to use the  private  laboratories.\r\n\r\nThis  importer  came  with  the declaration  from  a  private\r\n\r\nlaboratory.  We accepted the report of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate  laboratory. Now, we are saying that  maybe  not  all\r\n\r\nprivate laboratories can be trusted, and therefore, we  ought\r\n\r\nto  have a shorter list of accredited laboratories.  This  is\r\n\r\none of the things that we are thinking of doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the time difference, according to the report given\r\n\r\nto  me,  when  HSA first received the report of adverse  drug\r\n\r\nreaction,  they went out to the market and picked up  samples\r\n\r\nfrom  different  batches to test.  They  found  nicotinamide,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a B3 vitamin.  This is not banned, but the  dosage\r\n\r\nthat was found in this Slim 10 was beyond safe levels.  It is\r\n\r\nnot a banned item, but it is above the safe dosage.  HSA told\r\n\r\nthe  importer  to  withdraw  the item  and  the  product  was\r\n\r\nwithdrawn from retail. HSA also sent out an advisory  to  all\r\n\r\nthe doctors to say that they have received these adverse drug\r\n\r\nreactions and asked for other confirmation from the  doctors.\r\n\r\nIt  is  after  HSA sent out this advisory that other  doctors\r\n\r\nalso  sent  in  reports and HSA then suspected that  what  is\r\n\r\nadulterated is beyond B3.  From the kind of reports that they\r\n\r\nget  from  the  doctors,  they came to  the  conclusion  that\r\n\r\nexcessive dosage of Vitamin B3 could not have caused some  of\r\n\r\nthese  reactions.   These  reactions  were  not  just  hyper-thyroidism  but  also,  in some cases,  hepatitis.   So  they\r\n\r\ninvestigated further, and this is where they found traces  of\r\n\r\nfenfluramine, and this is where they put up the press release\r\n\r\nand   took  action.   HSA  took  action  according   to   the\r\n\r\ninvestigations, because when you bring in these products  and\r\n\r\nsend  them to the laboratories for testing, the test  results\r\n\r\ndo not come in immediately.  They take about a few days to  a\r\n\r\nweek for the test results to come in.  So I have examined the\r\n\r\nreport and the procedures.  I do not think HSA was laggard in\r\n\r\ntheir  reaction.  I think what they put out was  commensurate\r\n\r\nwith  the test results, and when they found this banned item,\r\n\r\nthen  I  think they make it very clear, not only to  withdraw\r\n\r\nthe product, but also to warn the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> I want to pick up the point from the\r\n\r\nMinister about the penalty.

And,  where  the rules for  safety  are  not  tight\r\n\r\nenough,  I  can  assure the House that we will tighten  them.\r\n\r\nBut  there  is  no  way we can evaluate, or  justify  to  the\r\n\r\npublic, the evaluation of efficacy claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR THE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 2002 TO 31ST MARCH, 2003</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b></b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Paper Cmd. 3 of 2002)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [5th\r\n\r\nAllotted Day].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head T (cont.) -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [18th May, 2002],\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the total sum to be allocated for Head T of the\r\n\r\nMain Estimates be reduced by $100.\" - [Dr Teo Ho Pin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.05 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, my time has been slimmed down considerably,\r\n\r\nso I will get straight to the point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, Dr Teo Ho Pin raised his concern about\r\n\r\npromoting family members' desire to stay together.   I  agree\r\n\r\nthat it is a very laudable objective.  That is the reason why\r\n\r\nHDB  gives higher housing grants for couples who want to  buy\r\n\r\nresale  flats near their parents.  Also, I think  he  may  be\r\n\r\naware  that in our balloting exercise for new flats in mature\r\n\r\nestates, we give a higher weightage to these couples so  that\r\n\r\nthey  have a higher probability of success.  So, as a  result\r\n\r\nof  these pro-family measures, HDB estimates that around  40%\r\n\r\nof  HDB residents with married children live with the married\r\n\r\nchildren,  or within the same estate.  This is based  on  the\r\n\r\nfindings of a survey that HDB did a few years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of shorter tenures, I think Dr Michael\r\n\r\nLim,  as  well  as  Dr  Amy Khor, raised the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nshorter tenures for HDB flats so as to enhance affordability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I would like to make on this is that\r\n\r\neven  with  99-year leases, currently HDB flats  are  already\r\n\r\naffordable.  As Members may recall last Saturday I cited  the\r\n\r\nfact that the typical four-and-five room flat applicants last\r\n\r\nyear  needed to use only about 15% of their household incomes\r\n\r\nfor   their   monthly  mortgages.   That   attests   to   the\r\n\r\naffordability  of flats currently even on 99-year  lease,  so\r\n\r\nthere is really no need for us to introduce shorter leases on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of affordability.  But we do have shorter  leases\r\n\r\nfor  specific purposes.  For example, we have 30-year  leases\r\n\r\nfor  studio  apartments for the elderly.  So the question  is\r\n\r\nwhether we want to expand this to other flat types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the fundamental objectives of our housing policy\r\n\r\nis, of course, home\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nownership.  Should we shorten the lease period significantly,\r\n\r\nas  some  Members  have suggested, this would  actually  make\r\n\r\nhousing a consumption item, rather than investment.   So  how\r\n\r\ndifferent  would  that  then be,  for  example,  from  rental\r\n\r\nhousing?  Would that not run counter to our objective of home\r\n\r\nownership?   And,  of course, there is also the  question  of\r\n\r\nacceptability.   Will  such  short  tenured  HDB   flats   be\r\n\r\nacceptable  to members of the public?  So these are  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  issues that we would need to consider, if we  are  going\r\n\r\nfor shorter tenures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few Members have also highlighted the issue of\r\n\r\nthe  housing  needs  of the singles - Mr Ang  Mong  Seng,  Ms\r\n\r\nIndranee,  Dr Michael Lim, among others.  Sir, let me  remind\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  House,  that public housing  is  subsidised\r\n\r\nhousing.   So the subsidies have to be justified  because  it\r\n\r\npromotes  some  social objectives.  And, in  this  case,  the\r\n\r\nsocial  objectives  in question would  be  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion and family values.  And that is  the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy public housing comes with many rules and regulations,  as\r\n\r\nsome  Members have pointed out.  We, of course, try  to  keep\r\n\r\nsuch  rules down to the minimum.  But even then I must  admit\r\n\r\nthat  the  rules are quite bewildering, even for me.   But  I\r\n\r\nwould like to assure the House that such rules are necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the question of housing for singles,\r\n\r\nlet  me state upfront that our public housing policy is  pro-family  in  orientation, and this is to  support  our  social\r\n\r\nobjective of promoting family formation and bonding.  But, at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, we also recognise that single citizens  have\r\n\r\nhousing needs, and that they have made valuable contributions\r\n\r\nto  our  society and to our economy.  And that is the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  we  have reviewed the rules and we have allowed singles,\r\n\r\nage 35 and above, to buy 3-room resale flats, on their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to Ms Indranee's claim that they are not\r\n\r\neligible for subsidised housing, in fact, they are.   Singles\r\n\r\ncan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napply  for a housing grant of $11,000, if they buy  a  resale\r\n\r\nflat.   And,  if they combine with another single  to  buy  a\r\n\r\nresale  flat  jointly, the grant is double,  it  goes  up  to\r\n\r\n$22,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the minimum age of 35? We have to have a cut-off,\r\n\r\nto  be  consistent with our pro-family approach.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  inadvertently encourage singles to live  away  from\r\n\r\ntheir  parents at too early an age.  So we checked with other\r\n\r\nagencies, and the advice was that marriage rates for  singles\r\n\r\ntend  to be much lower after this age, and this is the reason\r\n\r\nwhy we chose 35 years as the cut-off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are they eligible only for 3-room flats and not\r\n\r\nlarger  ones?  Sir, anyone who is familiar with a 3-room  HDB\r\n\r\nflat, which has got 2 bedrooms, about 70 square metres, would\r\n\r\nagree with me that this should be more than adequate for  the\r\n\r\nhousing needs of a single person, particularly in land-scarce\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also suggested allowing singles to rent HDB\r\n\r\nflats on their own.  Our current policy on this is to reserve\r\n\r\nHDB's  heavily  subsidised rental housing  for  lower  income\r\n\r\nfamilies who cannot afford home ownership.  There is always a\r\n\r\ncertain  segment of the population who will never be able  to\r\n\r\nown  their  own homes, and for them, they will  have  heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised  rental housing.  We do not encourage  singles  to\r\n\r\nrent  HDB  flats on their own, partly because of the  limited\r\n\r\nstock  of such rental flats, but mainly because we want  them\r\n\r\nto  look  first to their family for support.  We do not  want\r\n\r\nthem to look to the State in the first instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has suggested that we build HDB flats\r\n\r\npurely for singles to encourage social interaction.  Is  that\r\n\r\ncorrect?   That  was what I think I heard him  saying.   Sir,\r\n\r\nmany  Members of this House have actually asked  the  HDB  to\r\n\r\nreview its roles.  Some have said that HDB is actually  doing\r\n\r\ntoo  much  and it should be doing less.  Sir, even  while  we\r\n\r\nreview the role of HDB, I can categorically say that HDB will\r\n\r\nnot  take  on  this role of providing more opportunities  for\r\n\r\nsingles to meet.  I think there are many other agencies and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany other organisations which are much better placed to play\r\n\r\nsuch a role, organisations like SDU, SDS, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me take up a point which Ms Indranee and others\r\n\r\nhave  raised, and that is that it is difficult  to  obtain  a\r\n\r\nwaiver  of policy from HDB.  Let me state at the outset  that\r\n\r\npolicies  are  set  by  the  Government,  and  HDB   is   the\r\n\r\nimplementing agency.  The rules and regulations  are  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  to  support existing policies, and for  good  reasons.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as with all rules, there are always gray  areas\r\n\r\nat  the  margin,  and  this is the reason  why  we  have  got\r\n\r\nmechanisms  in  place  which  will  allow  HDB  to   exercise\r\n\r\njudgement and discretion on a case by case basis.  Exceptions\r\n\r\nto  the  rule do take place.  Camels do get through, quite  a\r\n\r\nfew of them, in fact, and big ones too.  But they are not the\r\n\r\nnorm,  I must admit.  In fact, there are not as many as maybe\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House  would like,  and  it  must  be  so.\r\n\r\nBecause, if there were too many camels getting through,  then\r\n\r\nsurely there is something wrong with the policy in the  first\r\n\r\nplace, in which case, we should review the policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, policies are not cast in stone. Members recall\r\n\r\nthat  the  housing policy for singles, in fact, was  revised,\r\n\r\nand reviewed, only last year, whereby we allowed the purchase\r\n\r\nof  3-room  resale  flats in all estates,  not  just  in  the\r\n\r\nsuburban  estates.   This, I believe, has been  very  popular\r\n\r\nwith the singles.  We will continue to review and refine  our\r\n\r\npolicies, when necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MPs sometimes raise specific cases in the House, on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of their constituents, and to illustrate their point.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing wrong with that.  In fact, that is  to  be\r\n\r\nencouraged  because  they are doing their  job.   However,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to point out that sometimes, there is often  more\r\n\r\nto each case than what MPs are told.  And it is only when HDB\r\n\r\ninterviews  their residents, to see how it can  assist  them,\r\n\r\nthat all the facts surfaced.  So, my advice is, do not listen\r\n\r\nto one side of the story before you make up your mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now go on to the other issues that were\r\n\r\nraised, particularly the one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  the review of public housing.  This is a matter  which\r\n\r\nmany  Members have raised, and I would like to take some time\r\n\r\nto touch on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the budget landscape for the Government in the\r\n\r\nfuture  will  not be the same as before.  Our public  housing\r\n\r\nexpenditure  would  have  to adjust  according  to  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  afford.  In the past five  years,  we  spent\r\n\r\nabout 1.1% of our GDP, or more than $1.5 billion annually  on\r\n\r\npublic  housing.   This includes things like  the  subsidised\r\n\r\nflat  prices, the housing grants, upgrading and so on -  1.1%\r\n\r\nof  GDP, which is considerable.  In the future, we will  have\r\n\r\nto be more prudent and more efficient in the way we spend the\r\n\r\npublic housing budget.  For a start, we have already embarked\r\n\r\non  a review of the way our public housing budget is managed.\r\n\r\nWe will be looking at all options pertaining to the financing\r\n\r\nof  HDB flats, taking into account, amongst other things, our\r\n\r\nbudgetary and financial position.  We are also reviewing  the\r\n\r\nroles  and functions of HDB, in particular, its role  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  public  flats.  HDB has  been  spectacularly\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  building  affordable  public  housing.    The\r\n\r\nexpertise,  the experience, and the achievements  of  HDB  in\r\n\r\nthis area, have won world-wide recognition.  For example,  in\r\n\r\n1991  it was conferred the World Habitat Award for developing\r\n\r\nTampines  Town, and my residents are extremely pleased  about\r\n\r\nthat.   This  was  done  against strong  contenders  such  as\r\n\r\nVancouver and Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, however, property development is a much more\r\n\r\nmature  industry.  And recognising this, HDB  has,  over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  been  gradually  increasing the  involvement  of  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector through, eg, its premium apartments.   We  can\r\n\r\nfurther increase private sector involvement to enable  us  to\r\n\r\nrespond faster and better to changing needs, and the changing\r\n\r\npreferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a first step, we are looking into the feasibility of\r\n\r\ncorporatising HDB's Building and Development Division  (BDD).\r\n\r\nSince the inception of HDB 40 years ago, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding and Development Division has accumulated a wealth of\r\n\r\nexperience  in the design and development of HDB  flats.   It\r\n\r\nhas  gathered considerable expertise in various  areas,  from\r\n\r\nsurveying  to  architectural  design,  from  engineering   to\r\n\r\nproject management.  It is especially strong in comprehensive\r\n\r\ntownship development.  All the HDB estates  -  the new  towns\r\n\r\n- have  been conceptualised and drawn up in the drawing rooms\r\n\r\nof  the BDD in HDB..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND and HDB are currently studying the implications of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  corporatised BDD.  A key consideration is to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  corporatisation does not bring about any adverse impact\r\n\r\non the delivery of our public housing programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of corporatisation include giving them the\r\n\r\nautonomy and flexibility to build on their current strengths,\r\n\r\nto  venture  overseas  and to establish  an  external  market\r\n\r\nleveraging  on  the HDB brand name.  It will enable  them  to\r\n\r\nunlock  their value and potential, because they have a  skill\r\n\r\nand  track  record  that few organisations around  the  world\r\n\r\nhave.    At  the  same  time,  the  public  housing  building\r\n\r\nprogramme  can  be  gradually opened  up  to  private  sector\r\n\r\ndevelopers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the outcome of the review, let me reassure\r\n\r\nMembers that there will be minimal impact on the public.   We\r\n\r\nwould  ensure  that  the fundamentals of public  housing  are\r\n\r\npreserved.  Singaporeans will continue to enjoy high  quality\r\n\r\nhousing at affordable prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I would like to assure Mr Othman Haron\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Iswaran that the Government appreciates the valuable\r\n\r\ncontribution  of  HDB's staff.  They  have  given  loyal  and\r\n\r\nsterling  service to HDB and the public, and their  interests\r\n\r\nwill be looked after in the review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have announced some changes to our public housing\r\n\r\npolicies  and programmes.  I have also outlined some  of  the\r\n\r\nkey  areas that MND will be addressing and the considerations\r\n\r\nthat we will bear in mind.  We will weigh the various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noptions before us carefully, keeping in mind the impact  that\r\n\r\nfundamental  changes in public housing policy  will  have  on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthe HDB introduced lift upgrading in the last few years as  a\r\n\r\nspecial   upgrading  work  that  will  benefit  only  certain\r\n\r\nresidents in HDB flats.  These residents are required to  co-pay  part  of the lift upgrading cost.  Yet, as I  understand\r\n\r\nit,  in  the  sales and purchase agreement that lessees  sign\r\n\r\nwith  the  HDB, it is clearly stated that any external  works\r\n\r\nto be done outside the flat at the block will be borne solely\r\n\r\nby  the HDB.  Lift upgrading is clearly external works.   Can\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  kindly  explain if it is violating  a  legally\r\n\r\nsigned contract by demanding that the affected residents  co-pay for the upgrading works?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan Cheng Bock is not here.

Most certainly, there is one policy which I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister  will revisit, and that  is  the  current\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the HDB of not installing lifts in  4-storey  HDB\r\n\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the flat dwellers purchased these flats 15 or\r\n\r\nmore  years ago, they were much younger.  There was a  spring\r\n\r\nin  their  step.   They were definitely much more  nimble  in\r\n\r\nrunning up and down four storeys of the HDB flats.  But  now,\r\n\r\nafter  many  years, there is less of a spring in their  step,\r\n\r\nthe  knees  are  getting a bit wobbly,  and  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nextremely  difficult  for  them to  climb  up  and  down  the\r\n\r\nstaircase,  particularly  for  the  women  who  have  to   go\r\n\r\nmarketing in the mornings.  They have to carry heavy  baskets\r\n\r\nand  climb  up  the  staircase; it can be quite  a  difficult\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really hope that the Minister will revisit this\r\n\r\nparticular  policy, taking into account  the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\npopulation has aged considerably.  I also hope that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  his  reply,  the  Minister will not  just  cite  economic\r\n\r\narguments, but will also look into the social aspects of  the\r\n\r\nissue that I have mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a related issue, which was raised by two of my\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  Mr  Othman  Haron  Eusofe  and  Mr  Iswaran,  on\r\n\r\nSaturday, the Minister had kindly given a very good assurance\r\n\r\nin  this House that the restructuring efforts in HDB will not\r\n\r\naffect  the interest of the workers.  I am very glad to  hear\r\n\r\nthat.   I  am  also happy to inform the House  that  the  HDB\r\n\r\nmanagement is in close contact with HDB staff union and  NTUC\r\n\r\non  this  matter.  And I am very glad to say that it is  none\r\n\r\nother  than  the  Minister himself  who  had  instructed  the\r\n\r\nmanagement to work closely with the union on this issue. As a\r\n\r\nlabour  MP, I appreciate his concern and I am confident  that\r\n\r\nwith  his personal interest in the issue, we will be able  to\r\n\r\nface changes without much disruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the information of the House, in our\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with  the  Board,  the  NTUC  has  conveyed  the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the need for adequate notice to prepare workers;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, effective communication to ensure that everyone\r\n\r\nunderstands the rationale and basis for the change,  and  how\r\n\r\nit affects them; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, appropriate assistance must be given to workers\r\n\r\nwho  are  affected,  particularly  in  relation  to  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes for the affected staff.  In this regard, the  NTUC\r\n\r\nSkills  Development  Department is currently  working  out  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  with  the  management to  put  staff  on  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   So, I am very glad to say that we  are  working\r\n\r\nvery closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to my first point, I would appreciate a\r\n\r\nresponse from the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, like my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  before  me, I am raising an  issue  on  the  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lift upgrading programme, which was launched last\r\n\r\nyear,  is indeed a laudable project.  I suspect that  it  may\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\novertaken  covered  linkways  as  the  single  most   coveted\r\n\r\nupgrading item by residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I visit my residents, the question of when\r\n\r\nthere  will be lifts at every floor inevitably crops  up.   A\r\n\r\nresident  who has a wheelchair-bound father asked if  we  can\r\n\r\nspeed  up  this programme, so that it will be more convenient\r\n\r\nto  bring his stroke stricken father out.  Many other elderly\r\n\r\nresidents also appealed for the lifts to be upgraded, so that\r\n\r\nthey stop at every floor.  Arthritis and rheumatism have made\r\n\r\nit increasingly difficult for them to climb stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, we have a fast-ageing population, and\r\n\r\nfacilities which enhance mobility and accessibility, such  as\r\n\r\nlifts  stopping  at  every floor, are not only  welcomed  but\r\n\r\nindispensable.  Such facilities are also much needed  by  the\r\n\r\nhandicapped whose interest sometimes we tend to overlook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of my precincts in Hong Kah North was fortunate\r\n\r\nto  have  been  selected  last year for  the  lift  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme.   All the residents in this precinct  are  eagerly\r\n\r\nawaiting  their  new lift system, except those  in  the  four\r\n\r\nblocks of 4-storey walk-up flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first question to the Minister relates to the 4-storey blocks of walk-up flats which have been excluded from\r\n\r\nthis  programme because, I am told, they are very costly  and\r\n\r\ntoo  few  residents benefit from this, compared to the  high-rise blocks.  My question to the Minister is: what medium and\r\n\r\nlong-term plans does the Ministry have for these flats?  This\r\n\r\nis  because  residents living in such blocks  have  expressed\r\n\r\ntheir  concern regarding the lack of lifts.  Some, especially\r\n\r\nthose living on the top floors, say that they are thinking of\r\n\r\nmoving out.  In fact, during my block visits, I noticed  that\r\n\r\nsome flats have been vacated, and I was informed by residents\r\n\r\nthat  the  flats have been empty for some time.   Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nworried  that,  over time, these blocks of flats  may  become\r\n\r\nurban slums when the residents move to other flats with lifts\r\n\r\nstopping on every floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, within the Bukit Batok division of my Hong Kah\r\n\r\nNorth  constituency alone, I have a total of 30 blocks of  4-storey  walk-up  flats with 603 units.   Many  older  estates\r\n\r\nwould  have  such  blocks of walk-up flats interspersed  with\r\n\r\nhigh-rise blocks, and would suffer the same fate with  regard\r\n\r\nto the lift upgrading programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to seriously look\r\n\r\ninto  and  resolve this issue with a definitive plan soonest.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it  may  be costly to provide such  lifts  to  such\r\n\r\nblocks,  the Ministry could look at providing, say, only  one\r\n\r\nset of lifts and using a cheaper lift system for such blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also submit that since these residents have been\r\n\r\npaying the same conservancy charges as similar sized flats in\r\n\r\nhigh-rise  blocks  all  these  years,  they  should  also  be\r\n\r\nentitled to the same upgraded facilities. Alternatively,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry could look into selective en-bloc redevelopment  for\r\n\r\nthese  blocks as clearly, over time, such flats  will  become\r\n\r\nincreasingly unattractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Sir, I would also like to request that the\r\n\r\nMinister   consider  giving  the  lift  upgrading   programme\r\n\r\npriority  over  the general interim upgrading  programme,  as\r\n\r\nhaving  accessibility  and mobility with  lifts  stopping  on\r\n\r\nevery  floor appears to rank highest on the wish list of  HDB\r\n\r\nresidents in the older estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, with\r\n\r\nthe launch of the Interim Upgrading Programme, the Government\r\n\r\nis  also  considering  upgrading lifts  and  installation  of\r\n\r\nlifts  to  blocks  of flats which have no  lifts.   This  has\r\n\r\nreceived   very   popular  response   from   the   residents,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the aged residents.  During  my  visit  to  the\r\n\r\nresidents,  many  of  them said to me  in  Teochew  that  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  Ministers are very good.  They  said,  \"They\r\n\r\nunderstand our problem and they have installed lifts for  us.\r\n\r\nThis  is  very  good.  I will vote for them.\"  This  response\r\n\r\nshows  that installation of lifts is very important to  them,\r\n\r\nparticularly to the elderly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has also installed lifts to three blocks of 4-storey apartments. These blocks are among the first to be\r\n\r\ninstalled  with lifts, and the residents are very happy  with\r\n\r\nthe  lifts.   They  were  very happy  when  I  visited  them,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  old folks.  However, under  the  new  Lift\r\n\r\nUpgrading  Programme, the 4-storey blocks are  not  included.\r\n\r\nTwo of my parliamentary colleagues have raised concerns about\r\n\r\nthis  matter.  I think this is a very important  issue  where\r\n\r\nthe residents are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the installation of lifts, why is the cost so high?\r\n\r\nIn  Bukit  Gombak,  there  is a practical  example.   When  I\r\n\r\nappealed for the installation of lifts, they said that  there\r\n\r\nmust  be at least 60 units in the block before they could  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  under this scheme.  Under the prevailing  policy,\r\n\r\nie,  linkways  have  to  be built to link  the  three  blocks\r\n\r\ntogether and this costs a lot.  However, if there are  common\r\n\r\ncorridors,  these linkways need not be built,  and  we  could\r\n\r\nsave two-thirds of the cost.  For high-rise flats, so long as\r\n\r\nthere  are  20 units, they qualify for lifts to be installed.\r\n\r\nWhy  is  the  standard different for 4-storey blocks?   Also,\r\n\r\nthere  may be other considerations if the Government  is  not\r\n\r\nwilling  to  install lifts for 4-storey blocks.  There  could\r\n\r\nalso  be redevelopment plans for the block of flats.  If this\r\n\r\nwere  so,  we  should announce well in advance  so  that  the\r\n\r\nresidents can decide whether to move out or to stay on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Government will look into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, like several of the\r\n\r\npreceding speakers, I want to raise a plea on behalf of those\r\n\r\nwho  have,  as Mdm Halimah Yacob put it, lost the  spring  in\r\n\r\ntheir  stride.   It  makes  me  wonder  whether  there  is  a\r\n\r\nstatutory board they can turn to for help!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has pointed out, quite accurately,\r\n\r\nthat  we  have a financial constraint going forward,  and  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  ensure that the dollar we spend is spent well.   In\r\n\r\nthat  regard, I want to raise two points for the Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider.  The first is whether we can indeed prioritise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Lift  Upgrading  Programme over  the  Interim  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme.   Because,  essentially,  the  Interim   Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme has lift upgrading plus covered linkways, and  then\r\n\r\nan assortment of other general municipal works, many of which\r\n\r\ncan  be  undertaken  by Town Councils on a progressive  basis\r\n\r\nfrom money they generate through the S&C charges.  That being\r\n\r\nthe  case, the big ticket item is the lift upgrading, and  it\r\n\r\nis  also  one  that  is  heavily sought.   The  Minister  has\r\n\r\noverseen the study on the ageing situation in Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nhe is well aware of the pressing needs on behalf of those who\r\n\r\nare  getting on in age, and they need this facility, in terms\r\n\r\nof the lift stopping on every floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is whether the programme can be\r\n\r\naccelerated.   In other words, quite apart from  prioritising\r\n\r\nit  over the IUP, whether we can, in fact, allocate even more\r\n\r\nresources to ensure that more flats benefit from this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is of scant consolation to a 65-year old to say\r\n\r\nthat the lift upgrading programme is a 10-year programme  and\r\n\r\nit will come to his flat or block in the fullness of time.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister can consider this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, where I come\r\n\r\nfrom,  Eunos  in  Aljunied GRC, we  have  a  relatively  high\r\n\r\npercentage of senior citizens.  Eunos is a relatively old HDB\r\n\r\nestate.   However, I am sure I speak for other similarly  old\r\n\r\nestates  and older flats built before 1990 where we  did  not\r\n\r\nhave lifts on every floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand why HDB did not build the older flats with\r\n\r\nlifts on every floor, as the priority then was to build flats\r\n\r\nfast  and  cheap.  But now, when that generation of residents\r\n\r\nhas  grown older and some aged, this consideration for  lifts\r\n\r\non every floor is now more urgent, especially when we want to\r\n\r\nensure  that more of the elderly continue to play  an  active\r\n\r\npart in our lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Eunos, only one block of those flats built before\r\n\r\n1990 has been given a Lift\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrading  Programme  (LUP) programme.   There  are  64  more\r\n\r\nothers  waiting.   Every visit I make  to  the  older  flats,\r\n\r\ninvariably,  I get this question asked: when do  we  get  our\r\n\r\nLUP?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that there are 4,000 such flats in Singapore\r\n\r\nawaiting  LUP, and during these days of downturn and expected\r\n\r\nslow   GDP   growth,  MUP/IUP/LUP  could  be  far  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's priority.  But can the Minister indicate when we\r\n\r\ncan  expect  LUP  for  more of the older estates  and  flats,\r\n\r\nincluding those at Eunos?  I urge the Government to  expedite\r\n\r\nthe process, as soon as we are ready to LUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, it is evident from the Members'\r\n\r\ncomments  that  upgrading is very popular, particularly  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading.   But let me point out that upgrading in  general,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  Main  Upgrading or Lift Upgrading,  is  very\r\n\r\nexpensive and very heavily subsidised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to make the best use of the limited budget that we\r\n\r\nhave for upgrading, MND has to constantly review the scope of\r\n\r\nthese upgrading programmes in order to make sure that we  can\r\n\r\nbring these programmes to as many residents as possible,  and\r\n\r\nalso to provide improvement items which residents value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we introduced the Lift Upgrading Programme\r\n\r\n(LUP),  and  this is to allow lifts to be provided  on  every\r\n\r\nfloor,  where feasible.  The feedback has been very  positive\r\n\r\nand I can understand why, because it does fulfil a real need,\r\n\r\nparticularly  for  those who have lost the  spring  in  their\r\n\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me also stress that the Lift Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme, which we introduced last year, does require a  lot\r\n\r\nof  resources.  Mr Steve Chia asked why residents have to co-pay.   It is precisely for this reason.  It is a very heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised  programme.   The number  of  blocks  which  still\r\n\r\nrequires  lifts on very floor numbers something  like  4,000.\r\n\r\nThis is not inconsiderable.  And he must appreciate, and I am\r\n\r\nsure every other Member here must appreciate, that, given the\r\n\r\nlimited resources that are available for upgrading,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  must be a certain level of priority.  I think Mr  Chia\r\n\r\nwants to say something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I want to clarify. I\r\n\r\nunderstand that it is very expensive and that maybe there  is\r\n\r\na need to co-pay.  I appreciate that the residents have to co-pay,  but  I  am  asking  whether the Ministry  did  actually\r\n\r\nviolate a legally signed contract in this case.  What is  the\r\n\r\nMinister  going to do about this violation of a contract,  if\r\n\r\nthere is a violation of contract?  That is my main concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The short answer is there is no\r\n\r\nviolation of any contract.  He can rest assured of that.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, external works which are of a general benefit to  the\r\n\r\nresidents, Government will subsidise, and residents will have\r\n\r\nto  co-pay.  In the case of lift upgrading, it is  even  more\r\n\r\nclear  that the benefit is to the residents, and this is  the\r\n\r\nreason why we have asked them to co-pay.  That has been  made\r\n\r\nclear  to  residents.   I think it is well  accepted  by  our\r\n\r\nresidents.   In fact, all the precincts that have polled  for\r\n\r\nthe  Lift Upgrading Programme have given us full support  for\r\n\r\nthis  programme.   So, it is well understood.   It  does  not\r\n\r\nviolate  any  legal contract whatsoever.  That much  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to assure Mr Steve Chia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with the lift upgrading, of course, there\r\n\r\nis  the  Interim Upgrading Programme which preceded the  Lift\r\n\r\nUpgrading  Programme.  What the Interim  Upgrading  Programme\r\n\r\ndoes is to provide some kind of upgrading works for precincts\r\n\r\nwhich  are not yet eligible for the main upgrading.   Interim\r\n\r\nupgrading centres more on block and precinct works.  But  all\r\n\r\nMembers  who  have spoken have expressed a  desire  for  more\r\n\r\nresources and more priority to be given to lift upgrading.  I\r\n\r\ndo  share that sentiment.  Within the resources that we  have\r\n\r\navailable,  we  will  try  to do so.   For  that  reason,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  decided to combine the IUP and Lift  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme (LUP) into a new programme which we will call  \"IUP\r\n\r\nPlus\".  What IUP Plus does is that it will bring IUP and  LUP\r\n\r\nworks  together at the same time to residents.  It  would  be\r\n\r\noffered to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresidents  at the same time.  It will be carried out  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  so  that we would no longer  have  to  have  two\r\n\r\nseparate  programmes,  one interim  upgrading  and  one  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By combining these two programmes into one, hopefully,\r\n\r\nwe  will  enable more flat owners to have the lift  upgrading\r\n\r\nworks  done  earlier.   At  the same  time,  they  will  also\r\n\r\ncontinue to enjoy interim upgrading works which will be  done\r\n\r\nat  the  block and the precinct level, including things  like\r\n\r\nlinkways,  etc, which, I think Members also agree,  are  well\r\n\r\nappreciated by residents.  So, we will try and have the  best\r\n\r\nof both worlds, as it were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 138,000 flats, which were built between 1981\r\n\r\nand 1986, will qualify for this new programme.  There will be\r\n\r\nno  change  in the polling and co-payment arrangements.   HDB\r\n\r\nflat  owners,  who  will  stand  to  benefit  from  the  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading  works, will be required to poll and pay  for  such\r\n\r\nworks  under  the  IUP  Plus.  As for the  interim  upgrading\r\n\r\nworks, it will continue to be fully funded by Government, and\r\n\r\nno  polling  is required.  IUP Plus will be introduced  later\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Lift Upgrading Programme itself will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be available for all high-rise blocks which  are\r\n\r\nnot  eligible  for the interim upgrading type  of  works,  in\r\n\r\nother words, a separate LUP programme for those which are not\r\n\r\neligible  for this IUP Plus.  These will be flats  that  were\r\n\r\nbuilt  after  1986  or flats that were  in  the  earlier  IUP\r\n\r\nbatches  which did not enjoy lifts stopping on  every  floor.\r\n\r\nSo  those that have already been done are still eligible, and\r\n\r\nthey can be nominated as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quite a few Members have touched on the issue of\r\n\r\nlift  upgrading for low-rise 4-storey blocks.  Again, I  must\r\n\r\nexplain   to   Members  that  there  is  a  real   need   for\r\n\r\nprioritisation.  We do not have unlimited funds.   Given  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  we  need  to see  where  the  Lift  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme can give more value and more benefits to residents.\r\n\r\nThe  Lift  Upgrading Programme was introduced last year.   We\r\n\r\nstill have about 4,000 high-rise blocks, as I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier, which do not have lifts on every floor.   Lift\r\n\r\nUpgrading  for  high-rise blocks will benefit more  residents\r\n\r\nthan low-rise blocks.  Furthermore, the provision of lifts to\r\n\r\nlow-rise  blocks is expensive, as Mr Ang Mong Seng  realised,\r\n\r\nand I think he has cited some figures.  But if there are low-rise   blocks  with  redevelopment  potential,  as   Mr   Ang\r\n\r\nmentioned,  we  will  certainly  consider  them  for  en-bloc\r\n\r\nredevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come now to the Main Upgrading Programme. To\r\n\r\nprovide  better  value  for money under  the  MUP,  MND  will\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on  providing improvement  items  which  are  of\r\n\r\ntangible benefit to HDB flat owners.  What we are going to do\r\n\r\nis  to  classify  the upgrading improvement  works  into  two\r\n\r\ncategories - the \"core\" and \"non-core\" categories.  HDB  flat\r\n\r\nowners,  through  the MUP Working Committee,  will  be  given\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility in choosing the works which  they  value\r\n\r\nmost.  When I talk about core items, I am referring to things\r\n\r\nlike  upgrading of toilets, covered linkways, etc, which  are\r\n\r\nvery  well  appreciated by residents.   Certain  items,  like\r\n\r\ntoilet upgrading, will be enhanced to include the replacement\r\n\r\nof  wash  basins.  As for non-core items, the  list  will  be\r\n\r\nexpanded to include, for instance, the replacement of  refuse\r\n\r\nhopper.  Again, this is based on feedback from MPs where some\r\n\r\nflat  owners have suggested that we include this item as part\r\n\r\nof the MUP.  But we will put this under the non-core category\r\n\r\nbecause not everybody would like to have it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the revisions I have just highlighted reflect the\r\n\r\nfeedback, as I said, from MPs as well as from residents,  but\r\n\r\nalso  from  our  own experience with past MUP projects.   The\r\n\r\nchanges will give us value for money and optimise the use  of\r\n\r\nour  upgrading  resources.  I am pleased  to  inform  Members\r\n\r\nthat,  despite the economic downturn, the Government will  be\r\n\r\nable  to sustain the same pace of upgrading this year  as  we\r\n\r\nhad done for the last five years.  In terms of the number  of\r\n\r\nprecincts,  we are going to announce the number of  precincts\r\n\r\nlater.   But  the number of precincts for this year  will  be\r\n\r\nsimilar to the number of precincts for the last few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government remains committed to upgrading. We\r\n\r\nare  facing  quite  significant changes  in  our  social  and\r\n\r\neconomic landscape.  So, we will have to review our upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme  continuously,  taking into  account  our  economic\r\n\r\nperformance.  The Government's financial position  will  also\r\n\r\nhave  to  be taken into account.  Of course, as Members  will\r\n\r\nrealise, we will also need to look at the competing needs for\r\n\r\nfunds   and   other  priority  areas,  like  healthcare   and\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, in the\r\n\r\nMinister's reply earlier, he said that the housing policy  is\r\n\r\npro-family.  Many singles are pro-family and indeed take care\r\n\r\nof  their  aged parents almost single-handedly.   Often,  the\r\n\r\nparent, usually the mother, is the co-owner of the flat  with\r\n\r\na  single.   But  when the parent passes  away,  a  traumatic\r\n\r\nexperience in itself, the single finds herself or himself ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Ng, are you making a speech or are\r\n\r\nyou asking a clarification?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> No. It is a clarification.\r\n\r\nThe  single is faced with the possibility of losing the flat,\r\n\r\nunless she can find another single to share the flat.  But it\r\n\r\nis  not  because the single is not pro-family that she  finds\r\n\r\nherself  without  a  mother or a father.   Can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider  reviewing this policy?  In fact, many singles  tell\r\n\r\nme  that  HDB has been quite compassionate in their  appeals.\r\n\r\nBut   I  thought  if  it  can  remove  the  uncertainty,  and\r\n\r\nreconsider this policy, it would be good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think that is another question.

Of  course,  in  terms   of\r\n\r\nprioritisation, specifically which blocks will get it  first,\r\n\r\nthis  is  ultimately  left to the Members  to  recommend  and\r\n\r\nnominate to the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind Members that when asking for\r\n\r\nclarification, you may ask the Minister something  which  you\r\n\r\ndo  not understand or something you want to be clarified, but\r\n\r\nnot  to raise a new question.

Much of what I wanted  to  ask\r\n\r\nhas  been  answered in the Question for Oral Answer and  also\r\n\r\nthe new policy of HDB.  But I just like to add one more point\r\n\r\nand,  that is, I agree with the Minister that, sometimes,  at\r\n\r\nMPS,  we do get all kinds of sad stories and they may not  be\r\n\r\nthe  complete stories.  But I would like to urge the Minister\r\n\r\nto  take  MPS  cases seriously and we have more than  80  MPS\r\n\r\ncases  and  feedback  from  MPS  cases  would  serve  as   an\r\n\r\nindication about the kind of problems faced by residents, the\r\n\r\nkind  of  policy  changes that are needed.  In  the  case  of\r\n\r\ndownturn  and  home ownership, it is not  just  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nrescheduling  payments  but also people  who  are  asking  to\r\n\r\nchange, in terms of application for flats, from 5-room to  4-room,  4-room  to 3-room.  I would like to get  clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the Minister whether the new policy in fact would  take\r\n\r\ncare of that kind of problem without much penalty being faced\r\n\r\nby the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Kian Min is not moving.

Suggestions ranged from rebates to training to  job\r\n\r\nplacements.   We all know too well that, for some,  the  jobs\r\n\r\nlost  are  gone  forever.   We are  not  just  battling  with\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment.  Increasingly, we will be faced with\r\n\r\nunder-employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the fact that there are a number of our\r\n\r\npeople  who  have been displaced by the current recession,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  it is necessary to help some of them to tide over their\r\n\r\ntemporary   difficulties   by   providing   them   with   the\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  earn some income in the informal  economy.\r\n\r\nDespite  the  proliferation of national efforts  expended  to\r\n\r\ntrain  and  retrain displaced personnel, we have  to  contend\r\n\r\nwith the fact that there are pockets of our workforce who are\r\n\r\nnot  trainable and therefore not employable, and pockets  who\r\n\r\ndespite being trained are not able to find jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I understand from the ground and from my\r\n\r\nexperience  at the MPS, many displaced employees  attempt  to\r\n\r\ntry another means of living.  Many have applied to be hawkers\r\n\r\nand  canteen operators, but since the number of stalls in our\r\n\r\nhawker centres and schools is necessarily limited, they  find\r\n\r\nthemselves  waiting  a  long time for their  licences  to  be\r\n\r\ngranted,  only  to find out that they may not get  a  licence\r\n\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was this Malay single mother who came crying with\r\n\r\nfour  young children to see me over her plight.  She has been\r\n\r\nseeing  me  in the last six months and earlier my predecessor\r\n\r\nfor not less than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsix months, so I was told.  She could not go on living on the\r\n\r\ncharity of MUIS, public assistance and the EDRS, so she said.\r\n\r\nShe has only Secondary Two education and finds difficulty  in\r\n\r\nlooking  for  a  job.  She needs to earn  money  for  a  more\r\n\r\ndefinite future.  But there is hope.  She can bake and  cook.\r\n\r\nIf  she cannot operate a hawker or canteen stall, can she  do\r\n\r\nsome home-based cooking and baking as an alternative?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As raised by Mayor Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, it is appropriate\r\n\r\nfor  an informal sector to be established in Singapore.  This\r\n\r\nsector  can  also be a spawning ground for the under-employed\r\n\r\nto  unleash  their potential, remembering that the  giant  HP\r\n\r\nstarted  from  the  home  garage  and,  closer  to  the  food\r\n\r\nbusiness, Colonel Sanders of KFC also started from  his  home\r\n\r\nkitchen after his retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am well aware of the possible consequences of\r\n\r\nnuisance,  disturbance and unsightly cluttering  of  utensils\r\n\r\nand  cartons  along  corridors.   All  these  could  lead  to\r\n\r\ncomplaints  by  neighbours.  However, such concerns  are  not\r\n\r\ngood   reasons  for  not  exploring  ways  to  address  these\r\n\r\nconcerns.  Working in concert with the town council  and  the\r\n\r\nCDCs, conditions can be spelt out to ensure good housekeeping\r\n\r\nand  orderliness.  Vigilant spot checks can  be  carried  out\r\n\r\nthrough  the CDCs, or town councils, whose set-ups have  been\r\n\r\npremised  on  the  ground as decentralised units.   They  can\r\n\r\ntherefore   be  more  flexible  in  serving  the   needs   of\r\n\r\nconstituents  under their charge.  In fact, to better  manage\r\n\r\nsuch  small-scale food operators, can they not be  registered\r\n\r\nunder  a central registry for easy access to them?  The  town\r\n\r\ncouncils  and CDCs could mount a briefing to inform  them  of\r\n\r\nthe  dos and don'ts.  After all, with HDB being an expert  in\r\n\r\nregulations, they should have no difficulty coming  out  with\r\n\r\nfurther rules, except that this time round, the rules may win\r\n\r\nthem  better  support  since they are meant  to  help  create\r\n\r\ntemporary jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that HDB is in the business of\r\n\r\nhousing,  and not jobbing.  But, Sir, if you wish to  nurture\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial spirit, we must surely allow for MOM and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntop  entrepreneurs to mushroom readily and spontaneously from\r\n\r\ntheir  homes  without their often feared cost of  capital  of\r\n\r\ndoing  business.  In fact, that was how Bengawan Solo started\r\n\r\nyears back and it was after it had sufficiently built up  its\r\n\r\nreputation  and  accumulated gains  that  it  turned  into  a\r\n\r\nroaring business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should not the remaking of Singapore stretch the courage\r\n\r\nand  imagination  of  the HDB to bring  spring  to  the  drab\r\n\r\nweather  that we are now in?  And let those who have  plucked\r\n\r\nup  enough courage to start something on their own so  as  to\r\n\r\nspring   forward  to  reach  their  dreams.   Without   being\r\n\r\ndisrespectful  to one of our MOSs in this Chamber,  I  recall\r\n\r\nreading  of  his  mother's food enterprise of satay  prepared\r\n\r\nfrom her flat dwelling.  I have no doubt that that enterprise\r\n\r\nhad  contributed  to  the nurturing and  shaping  of  one  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  sons who, today, is contributing to the  nation.\r\n\r\nI  urge HDB to open up its regulations to accommodate such  a\r\n\r\nworthy  request to help the needy and remove the  OB  markers\r\n\r\nthat  may  snuff out the entrepreneurial spirit,  instead  of\r\n\r\nuniting it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture, I will not labour over the issue\r\n\r\nof food preparation, hygiene and standards, which the HDB may\r\n\r\nraise  as concerns and reasons for not supporting my request.\r\n\r\nI  shall  be  addressing  that  with  the  Minister  for  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment.   Sir,  I  will request that  the  HDB  consider\r\n\r\ngranting  temporary  permits of  6-12  months  to  unemployed\r\n\r\npeople  to  operate small scale food business of a  specified\r\n\r\napproved  type  from out of their homes.   In  the  meantime,\r\n\r\nthese  people  will  have  to  work  hard  to  look  for   an\r\n\r\nalternative  job  or  eventually  transfer  their  home-based\r\n\r\nbusiness to proper locations once they are successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nlike to raise the issue of heavy vehicle parking.  Owners  of\r\n\r\nheavy  vehicles  often face the problem  of  finding  parking\r\n\r\nspace  near their homes.  As a result, many of them get fined\r\n\r\nvery frequently and these fines eat into their meagre income.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to find many of the heavy vehicle drivers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  have  a  parking lot which is very far away  from  their\r\n\r\nhomes.   So someone who lives in Jurong may have his  parking\r\n\r\nlot  in  Tampines, and vice versa.  The Ministry may want  to\r\n\r\nconsider  a once-off rationalisation exercise to allow  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle owners to change their parking lots so that they  can\r\n\r\nopt  for  a space nearer their home.  This will go  some  way\r\n\r\ntowards alleviating the problem for these drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new towns like Punggol New Town and Sengkang New\r\n\r\nTown,  it  is  surprising that there are no plans  for  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle  parks  even  though there  are  plans  for  a  light\r\n\r\nindustrial  estate on the southern fringe of  Sengkang  town.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  there are large tracts of land  which  are  not\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  used for the next 10 years.   Surely,  it  is\r\n\r\nbetter to put a piece of empty land to productive use, rather\r\n\r\nthan  to leave it idle for the next 10 years.  If the MPs  in\r\n\r\nPasir  Ris-Punggol GRC and Ang Mo Kio GRC cannot be convinced\r\n\r\nby  the  reasons given by HDB and URA that there is no  space\r\n\r\navailable  for heavy vehicle parking in Sengkang or  Punggol,\r\n\r\nhow can we convince our residents that that is so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, Government's policy\r\n\r\nhas  been that the cost of ownership of cars would be reduced\r\n\r\nover  the  long  run,  but the cost of usage  will  increase.\r\n\r\nHence,  we have increases in ERP charges.  We have ERP almost\r\n\r\neverywhere,  or soon to be everywhere, that we are  going  to\r\n\r\nhave  ERP  day and night.  I think very soon, ERP  will  mean\r\n\r\n\"every  road pay\".  Sir, the day will be quite soon when  the\r\n\r\nonly safe place to leave your vehicle is at home, if you  are\r\n\r\nlucky  enough to own a landed property.  You can well imagine\r\n\r\nthat, one day, if I drive out of my house, the first thing  I\r\n\r\nhear would be this \"beep\" sound coming from the little device\r\n\r\non  my  dashboard, and everywhere you go, you will be hearing\r\n\r\n\"beep, beep, beep\", instead of car horns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister of State for National Development was\r\n\r\nquoted as saying that HDB is going to suffer $99 million loss\r\n\r\na  year  in  running the car parks.  Therefore, it  needs  to\r\n\r\nincrease its car park charges\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  cover  this deficit.  Whereas his Minister was quoted  as\r\n\r\nsaying  that the reason why HDB wants to raise the  car  park\r\n\r\ncharges  is that it would have more money to build  more  car\r\n\r\nparks  in future in order to anticipate the increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of cars in Singapore.  So I would like to know  which\r\n\r\nis  which, and to be more precise, I would like to hear  from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister how much does it cost for HDB to build one  car\r\n\r\npark  lot, uncovered and covered.  I hope we will have enough\r\n\r\ntime so that I can follow up with more questions after we get\r\n\r\nthe figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, in this Budget the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  announced that car park charges  would  be\r\n\r\nrevised, and he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Where HDB residential parking is concerned, the\r\n\r\nexisting charges do not cover the costs of building  the  car\r\n\r\nparks, leaving HDB with a large deficit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I assume, is the justification for the increases\r\n\r\nin  HDB  season parking charges.  Of course, I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  HDB will take this opportunity  to  revise  the\r\n\r\nhourly parking charges as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have checked from the HDB's Annual Report and\r\n\r\nfound that in 1994/1995, the deficit from car park activities\r\n\r\nwas less than $6 million.  In 2000/2001, the deficit went  up\r\n\r\nto  $99  million.   The  bulk of the  increases  in  expenses\r\n\r\nresulting  in deficit were interest expenses and depreciation\r\n\r\nwhich  formed $62 million in 1995, increased to $140  million\r\n\r\nin  2001,  and interest expenses went up from $84 million  in\r\n\r\n1995 to $186 million in 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know how these changes in the\r\n\r\nfinancial position of HDB car park activities came about.  Is\r\n\r\nthe  HDB dumping the cost of building multi-storey car  parks\r\n\r\nin  the  new estates and upgraded precincts into the account?\r\n\r\nIf  this  is the case, is it fair to increase all HDB parking\r\n\r\ncharges across-the-board, including those old open car  parks\r\n\r\nin  HDB  estates  built in the 60s and 70s?  Is  the  deficit\r\n\r\nincurred  as  a result of HDB building more multi-storey  car\r\n\r\nparks,  bearing in mind that HDB continues to collect parking\r\n\r\nfees  even  for  car parks they already have, probably,  zero\r\n\r\ndepreciation value?  Building of car\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparks is therefore equivalent to a long-term investment.  And\r\n\r\nif  the depreciation is zero and the cost of building the car\r\n\r\npark  has been recovered long ago, I suppose, those built  in\r\n\r\nthe  60s and 70s, where is the justification to increase  the\r\n\r\nparking fees in these car parks by reason of HDB incurring  a\r\n\r\nhuge  deficit?   And if the justification is to  recover  the\r\n\r\nhuge deficit in car park operations, then is the HDB prepared\r\n\r\nto just break even for car park operation in the long run?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue I want to bring up is whether the\r\n\r\nHDB  has  a cyclical work plan to improve the car  parks.   I\r\n\r\nwish  to inform the Minister that car parks in the estate  in\r\n\r\nHougang constituency have not undergone any major improvement\r\n\r\nby  the HDB since they were built together with the flats  in\r\n\r\nthe  70s.   The  condition of most of the  access  roads  and\r\n\r\nparking  lots has been bad.  I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  the HDB would pay for improving the car park  access\r\n\r\nroads and the parking lots in Hougang constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, the new towns, such as\r\n\r\nSengkang  and Punggol, are lovely to look at.

On  this\r\n\r\nnote,  I  must  commend and thank the Minister for  the  town\r\n\r\ndevelopment  task  force which he set up in  Sengkang.   This\r\n\r\npilot  project,  which  has brought  together  more  than  20\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies  and different community  organisations,\r\n\r\nhas  made it possible for residents in Sengkang New  Town  to\r\n\r\nhave   significant   improvements  made   to   their   living\r\n\r\nenvironment,  and  a  rapid response  time  to  many  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems that they have faced.

There  are two other  areas  where  further\r\n\r\nimprovements can be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, better designs. One of the problems of the new\r\n\r\ntown  is that although the facade looks beautiful, there  are\r\n\r\nmany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems with the designs which have become regular irritants\r\n\r\nto   many  of  the  residents.   The  block  signs   are   so\r\n\r\naesthetically designed and well concealed that they cannot be\r\n\r\neasily seen by visitors or residents.  The sheltered walkways\r\n\r\nare  bright, airy, with beautifully-designed roofs, but leave\r\n\r\nthe  user  with little protection from even a gentle drizzle.\r\n\r\nThe  drop-off  points are strategically placed  with  arching\r\n\r\ncanopies  that invite rain to fall into the shelters,  making\r\n\r\none  wetter  than if one stood under an umbrella.   The  lift\r\n\r\nlobbies  are so cosily designed that you can hardly see  each\r\n\r\nother  in  the  day time, unless the lights are switched  on.\r\n\r\nThe lift buttons blend so well that you cannot figure out the\r\n\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am all for creativity and aesthetic designs. However,\r\n\r\nmore  importantly,  we  must  take  into  consideration  that\r\n\r\nfunctionality  and practicality must not be forgotten.   Much\r\n\r\nmoney will have to be spent to correct these design problems.\r\n\r\nIn  future,  the  Minister may wish to  consider  a  feedback\r\n\r\ncommittee  formed  from the community organisations  or  town\r\n\r\ncouncils,  which  will  give feedback  to  HDB  before  these\r\n\r\ndesigns  are  approved in the new estates.  This will  ensure\r\n\r\nbetter  designed  public flats which are both  beautiful  and\r\n\r\nfunctional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, designation of land use. In this age of\r\n\r\nincreased  transparency, URA and HDB should openly state  the\r\n\r\ndesignated  use  of  land,  eg,  for  churches,  temples  and\r\n\r\nmosques.  Flats next to a designated religious site may  have\r\n\r\nless  appeal  for  many but at least those who  choose  these\r\n\r\nflats  do  not feel that they have been given a big  surprise\r\n\r\nand  will be better adapted to the environment.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nshould  pre-designate  religious sites  in  advance  of  flat\r\n\r\nselection.   This transparency will bode well  for  new  flat\r\n\r\nowners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the early days,\r\n\r\nthe HDB always provided for wet markets in the old estates so\r\n\r\nthat  the  residents  could go and purchase  their  food  and\r\n\r\nmarket  produce.  The wet markets have all sorts  of  produce\r\n\r\noffering the residents very good choices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  residents enjoy buying their food there because they can\r\n\r\npick  and choose, and can even bargain for cheaper buys. But,\r\n\r\nin  the supermarket, there are no such facilities. The choice\r\n\r\nis limited and the prices are fixed and not bargainable. Most\r\n\r\nimportantly, at the wet market, residents can mingle with one\r\n\r\nanother  and talk about anything under the sun, even national\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, recently, in all the new towns, the HDB has stopped\r\n\r\nbuilding  wet  markets.   They have only  the  so-called  dry\r\n\r\nmarkets  which are actually housed in shops.  These are  very\r\n\r\nsmall and there is hardly any space for the residents to move\r\n\r\nabout.   The  situation is even worse when it  rains.   These\r\n\r\nshops,  when they are operating as markets, are not  hygienic\r\n\r\nand   people  are  not  very  happy  with  them.   Residents,\r\n\r\nparticularly housewives, would prefer to go to the wet market\r\n\r\nbecause  they  like this concept of wet market  better.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  Boon Lay, Jurong or Chong Pang, all  these  wet\r\n\r\nmarkets  are  very popular with the people and  the  business\r\n\r\nthere is very good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked the officers in HDB why they have stopped\r\n\r\nbuilding  wet markets, and they told me that the wet  markets\r\n\r\nwere  very messy, and that was why the Government had stopped\r\n\r\nbuilding  wet markets. I do not believe that the wet  markets\r\n\r\nare  messy.  Perhaps, they were referring to the great number\r\n\r\nof  people moving about in the area, and the wet markets were\r\n\r\nalways bustling with activities. So, if these officials think\r\n\r\nthat  they  should  not build wet markets  because  they  are\r\n\r\nmessy, then I am afraid they are terribly wrong.  I hope that\r\n\r\nHDB will reconsider this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, a lot of people queue up to buy HDB flats in\r\n\r\nthe  mature estates. When Channel News Asia interviewed these\r\n\r\npeople  why  they  were flocking to buy flats  in  these  old\r\n\r\nestates,  the spontaneous response was, \"Because there  is  a\r\n\r\nwet  market, it is very convenient here.  That is  why  I  am\r\n\r\napplying to buy a flat here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since most residents like the wet markets and they are\r\n\r\npopular  with  the residents, I hope that HDB  will  consider\r\n\r\nbuilding  wet  markets  in the new towns  like  Sengkang  and\r\n\r\nPunggol,  and  provide better services to the  residents.   I\r\n\r\nhope that HDB could conduct a survey among the residents, and\r\n\r\nfind  out  whether  they would welcome the provision  of  wet\r\n\r\nmarkets in the estate, before they formulate their policy.  I\r\n\r\nthink that would better reflect the wishes of the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr Yatiman's constituency, HDB has built a new wet\r\n\r\nmarket  to replace the dry market.  I would like to find  out\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  residents' response to  this  wet  market.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand from Mr Yatiman that the residents like  this  wet\r\n\r\nmarket  very  much.  If that is the case, would the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider  building more wet markets in the other estates,  to\r\n\r\nfulfill the wishes of the residents?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, first of all, let me take the\r\n\r\npoints raised by Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed on the question  of\r\n\r\nhelping  residents  cope  with  financial  difficulties.   He\r\n\r\nsuggested specifically allowing the residents to downgrade or\r\n\r\nto  buy  another  flat  in  order to  help  them  with  their\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  There are certain rules about this but, by and\r\n\r\nlarge,  there  is  no  difficulty for residents  to  actually\r\n\r\ndowngrade in order to get some money from their existing flat\r\n\r\nto cope with their difficulties.  However, there are requests\r\n\r\nfrom time to time concerning the interest rates that will  be\r\n\r\ncharged, and these are considered based on the appeals by the\r\n\r\nMPs.   I  would like to assure him that HDB will continue  to\r\n\r\ntake a sympathetic attitude to such requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it need not necessarily be so. They do not have to\r\n\r\nsell their flats if they do not want to.  In fact, there  are\r\n\r\nmany  schemes put in place by HDB to actually help  residents\r\n\r\nto  cope with their difficulties without having to give up or\r\n\r\nlose  their flats.  These have been quite successful.   There\r\n\r\nare  quite  a  number of residents who do take  advantage  of\r\n\r\nthese  schemes.   For example, the reduced  repayment  scheme\r\n\r\nwhereby   residents  pay  a  certain  percentage   of   their\r\n\r\ninstalments.   Instead of 100%, they pay 75%.   Or  they  can\r\n\r\ndefer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  instalment for six months, or they can actually extend\r\n\r\nthe loan repayment period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all these measures do help the residents cope with\r\n\r\ntheir   financial  difficulties.   They  are  actually   very\r\n\r\ngenerous measures that have been put in place.  In fact,  HDB\r\n\r\nwill  refine one of these measures even further, to  make  it\r\n\r\nmore  helpful to the residents, namely the reduced  repayment\r\n\r\nscheme.  Currently, they can pay 75% of the instalments,  but\r\n\r\nHDB  will, effective 1st July 2002, allow mortgagers  to  pay\r\n\r\nbetween 50-75% of their monthly instalment.  In this way, the\r\n\r\nresidents will be able to pay something and not have to defer\r\n\r\ntheir loan repayments totally.  This will be for a period  of\r\n\r\ntwo  years.  There will be a 6-monthly review by HDB, because\r\n\r\nHDB would like to ensure that residents, once they can afford\r\n\r\nto  pay,  will  actually restart their  instalment  payments.\r\n\r\nThis will be of help to the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, over and above all these financial assistance\r\n\r\nmeasures,  the greatest comfort to HDB lessees is really  the\r\n\r\nfact that they are protected from third-party creditors, even\r\n\r\nif  they are made bankrupt.  So whatever happens, eg, if they\r\n\r\nlose  money,  they are sued by other creditors and  are  made\r\n\r\nbankrupt,  they will not lose their flat.  This  is  probably\r\n\r\nthe  greatest  comfort to our residents.   Why?   Because  we\r\n\r\nhave,  since  we  started the public housing programme,  made\r\n\r\nsure  that home ownership is one of the cornerstones  of  our\r\n\r\npolicy.   It is a very important social objective.  I  wanted\r\n\r\nto  make  this point because there have been recent calls  to\r\n\r\nallow HDB flats to be used as collateral, in order to provide\r\n\r\nfunds  for  business.  It is an interesting proposal,  but  I\r\n\r\njust  want to add a word of caution here because, as I  said,\r\n\r\nhome  ownership  is  a  fundamental  principle  of  our  home\r\n\r\nownership policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many questions that we need to answer and many\r\n\r\nissues  that  we  need to look into before we  consider  this\r\n\r\nissue.   One of the first questions that we ask ourselves  is\r\n\r\nhow  do  we  ensure  that  the funds that  are  derived  from\r\n\r\nmortgaging the flat is actually used for business and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  used  for  consumption,  eg,  buying  a  car,  going  on\r\n\r\nholidays, etc.  And what if the business fails and they  lose\r\n\r\ntheir  flat?   Are they prepared to bear the consequences  if\r\n\r\nthings do not work out, or do they look to the Government  to\r\n\r\nprovide them housing as a last resort?  These are some of the\r\n\r\nquestions that we need to ask ourselves, and we will have  to\r\n\r\nstudy this proposal carefully before a decision is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just take this opportunity to respond to a\r\n\r\nquestion  that Ms Irene Ng asked just now.  She is not  here.\r\n\r\nThis is concerning the issue of singles or other people,  who\r\n\r\nas  a  result of the demise of a family member suddenly  find\r\n\r\nthemselves without a family nucleus and are worried that  HDB\r\n\r\nwould  turf them out.  I wish to assure Members of the  House\r\n\r\nthat  HDB will adopt a compassionate attitude to such  cases,\r\n\r\nespecially  where  one  member  of  the  family  passes  away\r\n\r\nbecause,  obviously, this is not by choice.  So,  in  such  a\r\n\r\ncase,  the  family  nucleus requirement is  waived,  and  the\r\n\r\nremaining occupant can retain his or her flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the issues raised by various Members\r\n\r\non  parking.  Let me take Dr Michael Lim's first about  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle  parking.   This is a perennial problem  in  our  HDB\r\n\r\nestates,  and there are two contending forces here.   On  one\r\n\r\nhand,  residents  are extremely upset when  they  have  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle  parks  next  to their homes.   They  create  traffic\r\n\r\nhazards and noise and smoke nuisance to the residents.   Sir,\r\n\r\nall  Members  who have heavy vehicle parks in  their  housing\r\n\r\nestates  can bear me out.  Trucks and buses start up  at  six\r\n\r\no'clock in the morning, and residents get woken up from their\r\n\r\nsleep.  As a result of that, we get constant complaints about\r\n\r\nsiting  of heavy vehicle parks in their housing estates.   On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  of course, there is a  demand  from  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle  owners  or  drivers who want  to  park  their  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicles right next to or near their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, heavy vehicle parks are popular in HDB estates\r\n\r\nprecisely  for this reason - because they want to park  their\r\n\r\nheavy vehicles near their homes.  But let me stress that  the\r\n\r\nheavy vehicles that are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing  used  are  not  meant  to be  used  as  their  private\r\n\r\ntransport.  They are meant to be used for business.  As such,\r\n\r\nHDB  cannot  provide enough parking lots for heavy  vehicles,\r\n\r\nbecause  there  is a real shortage of suitable  land  in  the\r\n\r\nhousing  estates.  Even if they did find a suitable piece  of\r\n\r\nland,  inevitably there will be competing uses or there  will\r\n\r\nbe  housing blocks nearby and, therefore, MPs will  complain,\r\n\r\nif  these  empty  plots  were used for heavy  vehicle  parks.\r\n\r\nThere are actually enough heavy vehicle parks island-wide for\r\n\r\nheavy   vehicles.   In  the  past,  URA  and  HDB  tried   to\r\n\r\naccommodate the demand for such parking lots on an interim ad-hoc  basis  on  vacant lands which are close to HDB  estates.\r\n\r\nBut,  as  I  have  said, this is no longer sustainable.   The\r\n\r\nexisting  interim parking lots will be phased  out  when  the\r\n\r\nland  is  needed for development, and more parking  lots,  if\r\n\r\nthese are needed, will be made available near workplaces like\r\n\r\nJurong, Kranji, Senoko and so on.  In fact, the LTA tells  us\r\n\r\nthat there are actually adequate parking lots island-wide for\r\n\r\nsuch  heavy  vehicles.  So I would urge Members to understand\r\n\r\nthe  constraints that are faced by HDB, and also to help  HDB\r\n\r\nto  balance the interest of heavy vehicle drivers on the  one\r\n\r\nhand and residents on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the questions raised by Mr Tan Soo\r\n\r\nKhoon  and  Mr Low Thia Khiang on our car park charges.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  question raised is:  why are we raising our  car  park\r\n\r\ncharges?  Is it justified?  The point is that HDB residential\r\n\r\ncar  parks  are heavily subsidised.  The current charges  are\r\n\r\nway  below the cost of providing these car parks.  The extent\r\n\r\nof  the  subsidy  for  last year, FY2001,  for  example,  was\r\n\r\nsomething like $115 million from the car park operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked where this deficit comes from. Basically,\r\n\r\nthe  cost incurred in running the car park includes the  land\r\n\r\ncost,  because HDB has to buy the land to build a  car  park.\r\n\r\nIt is not given away free of charge.  It is charged based on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresidential rates, because if we do not use the land for  car\r\n\r\nparks,  we can use it for housing.  The land is sold  in  one\r\n\r\npiece.   The other cost involved includes construction  cost,\r\n\r\nobviously.   Then, there is the cost of maintaining  the  car\r\n\r\npark.  Finally, there is interest cost, which is the cost  of\r\n\r\nfunds  used  for  building and buying the  land.   All  these\r\n\r\nelements  make up the cost.  There is a certain  depreciation\r\n\r\nperiod, and the cost is depreciated over this period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the income from car parks includes\r\n\r\nthe  parking  charges, which is the bulk of the  income.   It\r\n\r\nalso  includes  some  fines, but that is a  relatively  minor\r\n\r\namount.   If you take the cost and the revenues into account,\r\n\r\nyou  will note that there is a heavy deficit, something  like\r\n\r\n$100  million.   Even  after  we have  raised  the  car  park\r\n\r\ncharges, the deficit will still be quite considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental principle is this. Government will\r\n\r\nsubsidise  the  housing  needs of Singaporeans  in  order  to\r\n\r\nenable  them to have a roof over their heads, but  Government\r\n\r\nwill not and should not subsidise car owners who live in  HDB\r\n\r\nflats.  This is simply not fair to all the non-car owners  in\r\n\r\nHDB  estates.   I  would  like to  inform  Members  that  the\r\n\r\nmajority of HDB lessees do not own cars.  If we do not  price\r\n\r\nthe car parks properly, what is happening is that HDB will be\r\n\r\ncarrying  a  deficit in its books as a result of  subsidising\r\n\r\ncar owners.  Eventually, one way or another, this subsidy  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be borne by all HDB flat owners.  As a  matter  of\r\n\r\nprinciple, it is best for us to make sure that car owners pay\r\n\r\nwhat  is fair and what is adequate for the provision  of  car\r\n\r\nparks  for  them to use, and not to have this cost lumped  to\r\n\r\nthe non-car owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are we doing this now? The reason is because with\r\n\r\nthe new car policy, with the reduction in car taxes, with the\r\n\r\nincrease  in the number of COEs which has been announced,  we\r\n\r\ncan  expect our vehicle population to go up.  If  we  do  not\r\n\r\nreduce the deficit on car parks, and if we continue to have a\r\n\r\ndeficit on car parks, and if we have to build more car parks,\r\n\r\nthe  deficit is going to increase in the future.  It  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing to get smaller.  It is actually\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing to go up.  This is the reason why we have to raise  the\r\n\r\ncar  park  charges in order to recover the cost of  providing\r\n\r\nthe  car parks.  And the reason why we are going to raise  it\r\n\r\nin  September this year, is to coincide with the reduction in\r\n\r\ncar  taxes, with the implementation of lower road taxes.   We\r\n\r\nare  mindful  of  the impact of these increases  on  HDB  car\r\n\r\nowners  and  this  is the reason we are  timing  it  for  1st\r\n\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to give Members some idea. If a person is an owner\r\n\r\nof a 1,500 cc car, his road tax rebate will be something like\r\n\r\n$225 a year, which works out to $18.75 a month.  The increase\r\n\r\nin  the  monthly season parking charges for a  sheltered  car\r\n\r\npark lot is $15, which is less than the $18 rebate that he is\r\n\r\ngetting  for car taxes.  If we are talking about surface  car\r\n\r\npark  lots, the increase would be $10, again lower  than  the\r\n\r\nreduction in car taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this revision in HDB/URA car park charges is\r\n\r\npart  of  the  larger  package of measures  that  affect  car\r\n\r\nowners,  where the intention is to match the cost of  driving\r\n\r\nwith  usage,  rather  than ownership  of  cars.   So,  it  is\r\n\r\ninevitable that motorists, who use their vehicles a lot, will\r\n\r\nhave to bear the higher cost of usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also asked whether we will eventually go for\r\n\r\nbreakeven in the charges for car parks.  We do not have plans\r\n\r\nat  the  moment to reach breakeven level.  Let us explain  to\r\n\r\nthe  public  and get the public to accept that the  increases\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  going  to  implement  on  1st  September   are\r\n\r\nreasonable  and  acceptable, and also get the message  across\r\n\r\nwhy we have to raise car park charges come 1st September.  We\r\n\r\nare not looking for breakeven at this point in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as maintenance of car parks is concerned, in\r\n\r\nHougang  constituency, if Mr Low has any specific  complaints\r\n\r\nabout  the car parks in his constituency, he may let the  HDB\r\n\r\nknow.   As for certain parts of the car parks, I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhich  part he is referring to.  Some parts may be under  the\r\n\r\nTown Council, and some under HDB.  But if he can let the  HDB\r\n\r\nknow,  I  am sure they will look into it.  The point is  that\r\n\r\nthere is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed  for car parks to be maintained. We do not just build  a\r\n\r\ncar  park and then after that, we let it be.  There is a cost\r\n\r\nincurred  in  maintaining  car  parks,  and  this   cost   of\r\n\r\nmaintaining car parks is also part of the cost which  I  have\r\n\r\njust  cited  earlier, which is the reason for the deficit  in\r\n\r\ncar parks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask my Minister of State to deal with the other\r\n\r\nquestions on wet markets, as well as on the use of HDB  flats\r\n\r\nfor food business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek clarification from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister?   We  have now heard another  reason  for  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  car park charges because there is  a  road  tax\r\n\r\nrebate.   So the Government is giving money in one  hand  and\r\n\r\ntaking back from the other hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, I do not see any Government subsidy\r\n\r\nreflected in the accounts.  The amount of deficit, I believe,\r\n\r\nis  a  total  reflection of the cost.  I wonder  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  agree  that  if  the  depreciation   of   the\r\n\r\nconstruction cost is taken over a longer period of  time,  it\r\n\r\nwill not incur so much deficit and thereby, we can afford  to\r\n\r\ncharge lower car park fees.  My other question is whether are\r\n\r\nthere  cyclical plans for car parks, just like HDB flats  and\r\n\r\nnot so much on the maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, the Minister did not answer my\r\n\r\nquestion  about the cost to HDB of an open surface  car  park\r\n\r\nand a covered carpark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> First of all, Mr Low is quite\r\n\r\ndisingenuous to say that the reason for us to raise  our  car\r\n\r\npark charges is because the road taxes have come down.  I did\r\n\r\nnot  say  that.   What  I said was that  the  timing  of  the\r\n\r\nincrease  is such that the increase of car park charges  will\r\n\r\nbe  defrayed somewhat by the reduction in the road taxes.  We\r\n\r\ncould  have  raised it earlier, but we did not  do  so.   The\r\n\r\ntiming of 1st September is precisely for that reason, to make\r\n\r\nsure that the impact on motorists is minimised.  It is not  a\r\n\r\nreason  for doing so.  I hope Mr Low will not get  the  wrong\r\n\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the issue of depreciation, yes, we do\r\n\r\ndepreciate over the life of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncar parks.  I am not sure exactly what the life span is.  But\r\n\r\nthe  cost,  under  normal accounting  practices,  has  to  be\r\n\r\ndepreciated  over the life of the car parks,  and  I  believe\r\n\r\nthis  is being done.  On cyclical works, yes, of course,  the\r\n\r\ncar  parks will also have to undergo cyclical works.   If  we\r\n\r\nare  talking  about a multi-storey car park,  some  of  these\r\n\r\nworks  would not come under the Town Council, but come  under\r\n\r\nthe  HDB.   As  for  surface car parks,  the  cyclical  works\r\n\r\ninvolved  will  be minimal, but it still needs  to  be  done.\r\n\r\nResurfacing,  for  example,  needs  to  be  done.   The  more\r\n\r\ncritical  work  that needs to be done is the  replacement  of\r\n\r\nthese  surface  car parks with multi-storey  car  parks.  The\r\n\r\ndemand for car park space is very high in HDB estates, and we\r\n\r\nhave to constantly look for ways of increasing the number  of\r\n\r\ncar  park  lots.  One of the ways of doing so is  to  replace\r\n\r\nsurface car parks with multi-storey car parks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me answer Mr Tan Soo Khoon's question about cost.\r\n\r\nThe  estimated cost of providing a surface car  park  lot  is\r\n\r\nsomething like $11,000, and this includes land cost  as  well\r\n\r\nas  construction cost.  But the construction cost, obviously,\r\n\r\nis  much lower than the land cost.  Then, for the covered car\r\n\r\npark,  it  is  about $20,000.  In this case, the construction\r\n\r\ncost  is much higher. The land cost, of course, can be  split\r\n\r\nup  over  more  car  parks.  These are roughly  the  ballpark\r\n\r\nfigures at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the HDB do cyclical works such\r\n\r\nas resurfacing the access roads to open surface car parks?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, I believe they do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> What is the timeframe, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I am afraid that I do not have the\r\n\r\nanswer.  I  would imagine that it is done as and when  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.   I  do  not have the answer, but  if  the  Member\r\n\r\nwishes to file a Question, I will give him the answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, in 1989, the then Minister for\r\n\r\nNational Development told the House that the cost of an  open\r\n\r\nsurface  car park lot to HDB was $14,443, and $32,581  for  a\r\n\r\ncovered  car park lot.  Based on what the Minister  has  just\r\n\r\ntold us, it would appear that the cost of providing car parks\r\n\r\nto  HDB has dropped by quite a lot in the last 10 years.  Can\r\n\r\nhe  still  justify the increase in charges if it is based  on\r\n\r\ncost?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if it is $11,000 for building an open air car\r\n\r\npark  lot,  and if the size of the car park lot is  about  60\r\n\r\nsquare  feet, that works out to almost $200 per square  foot,\r\n\r\nand  this is providing something without four walls, no roof,\r\n\r\nno  water,  no  power supply.  Is this not a  very  expensive\r\n\r\npiece of real estate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, first of all, I cannot comment on\r\n\r\nthe  figures  that were cited earlier.  I will  go  back  and\r\n\r\ncheck.  But these are the figures that have been given to  me\r\n\r\nnow  and they are, I presume, the current figures. Even  with\r\n\r\nthese  figures,  there  is still a deficit.   To  answer  his\r\n\r\nquestion  whether we are justified, the point  is,  based  on\r\n\r\nthis  cost,  we  still run a deficit of over $100  million  a\r\n\r\nyear.  And even with the increase, we are still going to  run\r\n\r\na  deficit close to that amount.  The answer to his  question\r\n\r\nis yes, we are justified in raising the charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On cost of the real estate, yes, land cost is very high.\r\n\r\nAs I have said earlier, the cost of the land for car parks is\r\n\r\ntreated  the  same  as  the cost of land  for  housing.   The\r\n\r\njustification for this is very simple.  If we do not use  the\r\n\r\nland  for car park, we have to use the land for housing.   So\r\n\r\nwe better make sure that we make good use of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Sir, let me answer the points raised\r\n\r\nby  Mdm Ho Geok Choo on promoting the informal sector in  HDB\r\n\r\nflats.   In  her  speech, she mentioned  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\ncoming  up  with  more rules and registration  procedures  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  this.  I am glad to inform her that there  is  no\r\n\r\nneed for registration and additional rules in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHDB  already permits various small-scale business  activities\r\n\r\nto  be  conducted  from HDB flats, and these activities  will\r\n\r\ninclude making satay, tarts, baking cakes, music, tuition and\r\n\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, HDB's foremost priority is to preserve the\r\n\r\nresidential  nature  of  these  flats.   As  long  as   these\r\n\r\nactivities  do  not  contravene and  change  the  fundamental\r\n\r\nnature of these residences, HDB does not require them to even\r\n\r\nregister with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the public health standpoint, I think\r\n\r\nshe  can  take  it up with the Minister for the  Environment,\r\n\r\nwhether they will permit food prepared within these flats  to\r\n\r\nbe  sold to the general public.  With all the concerns now on\r\n\r\npublic health, especially after Question time today, I  think\r\n\r\nall Ministers will be a lot more cautious on that note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to move on to Dr Michael Lim's points about new\r\n\r\ntowns.   In  particular,  he talked  about  having  beautiful\r\n\r\ndesigns, which are not necessarily the most functional.   All\r\n\r\nof  us  in  this  House are realistic enough, and  practical-minded people, who do want beautiful designs to be, first and\r\n\r\nforemost,  practical.  We are mindful of this.  We  are  also\r\n\r\nmindful  of  the  fact  that it is not enough  to  just  have\r\n\r\nsomething  beautiful, but we want it to be easily maintained,\r\n\r\nbecause in the long run this affects our cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take his point that the people who have a greater\r\n\r\nstake in this are the professionals and the residents on  the\r\n\r\nground.   That  is  why before HDB embarks on  any  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme,  it  will always consult advisors  and  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations, as to the form and the structures  which  need\r\n\r\nto  be put up.  However, I just want to add a cautionary note\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  impossible  to please all-comers  and  to  make\r\n\r\neverybody happy with all the different perspectives.  At  the\r\n\r\nend  of  the day, we have to come out with a design which  is\r\n\r\nworkable, and which addresses as many needs as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim also brought up his perspective about pre-designating religious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsites.  Let me assure the House again that planning is a most\r\n\r\ndifficult  process.  We have to trade off  sometimes  between\r\n\r\nflexibility and being overly specific at a premature point in\r\n\r\ntime, in which case, we actually constrain flexibility.   But\r\n\r\nhaving said that, wherever possible, if we are certain on the\r\n\r\nspecific  use  of a site, the HDB will seek to transmit  that\r\n\r\ninformation   to   the  advisors  and   to   the   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations as soon as possible.  But I think Members  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  appreciate that sometimes we do not  have  all  the\r\n\r\nanswers at that point in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to move on to Mr Ang Mong Seng's point on wet\r\n\r\nmarkets.   Prior  to 1982, the HDB built wet markets  in  HDB\r\n\r\ntowns.   However, sometimes these things became a  bit  messy\r\n\r\nand  unhygienic,  and I take his point  that  this,  to  some\r\n\r\nextent,  would  have been caused by the fact that  there  was\r\n\r\nrelative  overcrowding, or too many  people  using  it.   But\r\n\r\nafter  1982, a policy decision was made to stop building  wet\r\n\r\nmarkets, and instead to build dry markets.  These dry markets\r\n\r\nreally  consist of a cluster of market produce  shops  and  a\r\n\r\nsupermarket.   But, in reality, what happened  was  that  the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers and the residents started treating these like wet\r\n\r\nmarkets.  This became neither fish nor fowl, and it ended  up\r\n\r\nbecoming a hybrid, which was just as messy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 1992, the HDB stopped building these dry markets\r\n\r\nand  moved  on  to  a new concept, which we called  the  \"new\r\n\r\nmarket\".  These were similar in character to the wet markets,\r\n\r\nbut  there  was a key difference.  They were designed  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  hygienic,  easily  maintained, better  drainage,  wider\r\n\r\naisles,  and  there  were larger market  stalls.   These  new\r\n\r\nmarkets  are usually co-located with other retail and  eating\r\n\r\nfacilities   in  stand-alone  neighbourhood  centres.    Such\r\n\r\nintegrated facilities provide a better marketing and shopping\r\n\r\nenvironment  for  the  residents.  Examples  of  these  would\r\n\r\ninclude  Rivervale Plaza in Sengkang Town  and  the  Yew  Tee\r\n\r\nShopping Centre in Chua Chu Kang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since October 2000, the HDB has also started tendering\r\n\r\nout  designated sites in new towns to the private sector  for\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision of retail marketing and eating facilities  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of  the  residents.  The successful  tenderer  is\r\n\r\nallowed  to  decide whether he is going to  construct  a  new\r\n\r\nmarket  or a supermarket.  But, obviously, this will have  to\r\n\r\ntake  into  account the residents' needs on the  ground.   We\r\n\r\nthink  that,  in  this way, we will evolve forms  of  markets\r\n\r\nwhich will address the needs of the residents, whilst at  the\r\n\r\nsame time being practical and hygienic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo Ho Pin, we are running behind\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, despite contributing about 5-8% to\r\n\r\nour  GDP  yearly, the construction industry is not a  sunrise\r\n\r\nindustry.    It  faces  problems  of  sustainable   workload,\r\n\r\nshortage of labour, lack of innovation, low productivity  and\r\n\r\na poor public image.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, not much attention has been paid to the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the  construction  industry.    The   recent\r\n\r\nfailures  of  some large construction firms,  which  affected\r\n\r\nvarious  public  projects and many industries,  clearly  show\r\n\r\nsigns of possible collapse of the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Construction 21 plan does not provide key strategies\r\n\r\nto develop our industry.  There is a lack of focus to nurture\r\n\r\nlocal  consultants and contractors to be world-class players.\r\n\r\nI  would  suggest  that the Ministry set up an  International\r\n\r\nAdvisory Panel to develop our construction industry.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwish to ask the Minister the following questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the key strategies in developing the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  What are the plans to nurture local consultants and\r\n\r\ncontractors to be world-class players?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)  What are the strategies adopted by BCA to export\r\n\r\nconstruction services?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, when\r\n\r\nconstruction companies, which are undertaking the MUPs or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  IUPs  in our housing estates, are not able to  meet  the\r\n\r\nproject  schedules, the residents staying in the MUP and  IUP\r\n\r\nprecincts are greatly inconvenienced.  This will be  more  so\r\n\r\nwhere  residents  want  to renovate their  flats  and  cannot\r\n\r\nproceed  because the internal upgrading works to be  done  by\r\n\r\nthe  MUP contractors are delayed.

Their problem may be of a temporary nature  - sometimes it is just a cash-flow problem.

As such, the impact of\r\n\r\nconstruction operations on the environment can be undesirable\r\n\r\nin  the  long run.  I wish to ask the Minister the  following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the initiatives taken to encourage sustainable\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;construction?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How many construction firms are ISO 14000 registered?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on construction technology. The incentive schemes\r\n\r\nby  BCA  have  not been successful in encouraging  technology\r\n\r\ninnovations  among  contractors.  As  a  result,  many  local\r\n\r\nconstruction  firms  have  not developed  any  capability  or\r\n\r\nniches  to be globally competitive.  Sir, I wish to seek  the\r\n\r\nfollowing clarifications from the Minister:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the state of technological advances in our\r\n\r\nconstruction industry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How does BCA facilitate the introduction of new\r\n\r\nconstruction technologies in the industry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the R&D efforts by BCA to encourage\r\n\r\ntechnological innovations in the industry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on contractors' registry. The existing and\r\n\r\nproposed  new contractor registration system by BCA has  some\r\n\r\nfundamental  flaws.  It provides protectionist mechanism  for\r\n\r\nconsultants and contractors.  This contradicts the Ministry's\r\n\r\nplan to promote self-regulation in the industry.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  it restricts open competition among contractors  based\r\n\r\nupon  performance  and track records.  At  present,  the  BCA\r\n\r\nregistration  scheme forces contractors to procure  contracts\r\n\r\nat  unrealistic  tender  prices and  adopt  substantial  sub-contracting   of   their  work  to  meet   the   registration\r\n\r\nrequirements.  This has resulted in the liquidation of  firms\r\n\r\ncausing  delays  of  projects  and  loss  of  jobs  to   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   All  these  hamper  efforts  to  develop  the\r\n\r\ncapability of our contractors and consultants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to seek the following clarifications from\r\n\r\nthe Minister:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Why do we need a contractor registration system while\r\n\r\nother industries do not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In the proposed contractor registration system, why is\r\n\r\nthere a requirement to have one-third architects or engineers\r\n\r\nrunning a construction firm?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) How will it help in nurturing world-class construction\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firms?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, precast concrete is now widely\r\n\r\nused  for  the  construction of HDB  flats.   It  has  become\r\n\r\nimportant  components  of flats.  I understand  that  in  the\r\n\r\npast,  HDB  required  the presence of inspectors  before  the\r\n\r\ncasting  was done.  However, presently, the system  has  been\r\n\r\nchanged  to that of merely conducting  random spot checks  on\r\n\r\nthe plant, and testing of the precast concrete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the above, I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\naddress  two  concerns.  One, how does HDB  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nprecast slabs are of acceptable quality and do not inherently\r\n\r\ncontain  potential problems, such as spalling in the  future.\r\n\r\nTwo,  will  the  Minister explain and  evaluate  the  current\r\n\r\nsystem  of inspection and supervision of precast plants,  and\r\n\r\nhow the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquality  of  precast  concrete components  in  HDB  flats  is\r\n\r\ndetermined and assured?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Sir, on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Minister for National Development, I would like\r\n\r\nto  thank  all  the Members for the questions.   They  raised\r\n\r\nimportant  questions on an important sector of  the  economy.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to reassure Members that the Ministry  is\r\n\r\nfully  focused  on  the rehabilitation  of  the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.   Contractors  in Singapore have  made  significant\r\n\r\ncontributions  to our economy without which  our  first-class\r\n\r\neconomy could not have been built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MND is determined to help contractors ride out this\r\n\r\nvery  severe  recession, at least as far  as  contracting  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.  But  like  other sectors  of  the  economy,  Sir,\r\n\r\ncontractors also have to restructure their business.  The BCA\r\n\r\nis  there  to help them along.  The BCA in Singapore  is  not\r\n\r\njust  a regulator, but is also a promoter of the construction\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your indulgence, I would like to answer Mr\r\n\r\nLow's  question first, just in case I am guillotined by  your\r\n\r\nsamurai  sword!   Mr Low raised a point about the  structural\r\n\r\nsafety of precast components, ie, the strength of precast and\r\n\r\nprefabricated  components  used  in  constructing  buildings.\r\n\r\nEssentially, he has asked how assured are we that there is no\r\n\r\ncutting  of corners, there is no collusion and corruption  in\r\n\r\nthe precast yards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all precast components used in buildings have to be\r\n\r\ncertified by a professional engineer.  In the trade, we  call\r\n\r\nhim  or  her  PE.   This  PE  is personally  liable  for  the\r\n\r\nstructural  safety of buildings he or she designs,  and  this\r\n\r\nprofessional  liability  is  a  life-time  liability.    This\r\n\r\nliability  cannot be extinguished until he or she  dies.   So\r\n\r\nlong  as  the building stays, his or her liability is  there.\r\n\r\nSo,  it is unlikely that a PE will treat the matter of safety\r\n\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, we require a PE to certify that the\r\n\r\nstructural component precast in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe yard is safe; in other words, it is precast according  to\r\n\r\nthe   working  drawing.   The  working  drawing  is  designed\r\n\r\naccording  to  the loading of the building.   If  he  or  she\r\n\r\ncannot  perform the supervision  personally, then he  or  she\r\n\r\ncan reassign the task to a clerk-of-works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come now to HDB, because HDB is the biggest\r\n\r\ndeveloper  in  Singapore, and is a concern of  the  Ministry.\r\n\r\nOut of the 32 precast yards in Singapore, 28 of them are HDB-approved yards.  In other words, we only buy from these  HDB-approved  yards.  These yards provide precast  components  to\r\n\r\nHDB  buildings.  Because HDB is the biggest developer, it has\r\n\r\neven  more  stringent  layers of  checks.   First,  HDB  will\r\n\r\nrequire  a  professional engineer or  his  clerk-of-works  to\r\n\r\ncertify the components before the parts are delivered to  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  site.  In other words, the checks must be  done  in\r\n\r\nthe  precast  yard.  This is on top of the  requirement  that\r\n\r\nthese  HDB-approved  yards must have a resident  engineer  to\r\n\r\nsupervise  the  overall casting procedures.   So  we  have  a\r\n\r\nresident engineer to oversee the yard; then we have a  PE  to\r\n\r\ncertify each and every beam that comes to the site.  If he or\r\n\r\nshe cannot do it, he or she assigns that responsibility to  a\r\n\r\nclerk-of-works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on special production lines, HDB requires that\r\n\r\nthe  casting and checking procedures be recorded 24 hours for\r\n\r\nvalidation  purposes.  In other words, the precast  procedure\r\n\r\nis recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, on site, HDB engineers will also do checks to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that the precast components delivered to the  site\r\n\r\nbefore installation are of certified quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are three layers of checks. Members can be\r\n\r\nassured that all buildings in Singapore are safe.  If Mr  Low\r\n\r\nknows  of  any  collusion or corruption in any precast  yard,\r\n\r\nplease alert the Ministry, or he can report the matter to the\r\n\r\nCPIB.  This is a very serious matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go on to the questions raised by PAP\r\n\r\nMPs.   I  humbly  disagree with Dr Teo that  C  21  does  not\r\n\r\nprovide any strategic objective to uplift the ailing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.  In 1999, a comprehensive  review  of\r\n\r\nthe industry was carried out.  This review was jointly led by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  National  Development,  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nManpower  and  all the related consultants, associations  and\r\n\r\ncontracting  bodies in Singapore.  Together, we  agreed  that\r\n\r\nthe  C  21 is the solution, not a problem to the construction\r\n\r\nindustry.  Sir, I will be happy to ask the BCA to update  the\r\n\r\nGPC on the progress made by C 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the key strategies of C 21 is to raise the\r\n\r\noverall  performance of the industry in terms of productivity\r\n\r\nand  capabilities  of  our firms.   After  several  years  of\r\n\r\nnegative  productivity, the industry registered a humble  but\r\n\r\nvery  encouraging positive productivity of  0.2%  last  year.\r\n\r\nMeasures   to   raise   productivity,   including   promoting\r\n\r\nbuildability, raising minimum skill levels and cut in foreign\r\n\r\nman-year entitlements  -  what we call the MYE  -  are making\r\n\r\ngood  progress.  However, it will take quite a while for  the\r\n\r\ntrue benefits of these measures to be harvested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to upgrade local capabilities, BCA works with EDB\r\n\r\nand SPRING to offer a broad range of schemes to encourage the\r\n\r\nindustry  to adopt new technologies.  Since 2000,  about  $12\r\n\r\nmillion  worth  of funds have been disbursed  to  almost  200\r\n\r\nfirms   under  the  Industry  Productivity  Fund,  Innovation\r\n\r\nDevelopment Scheme and the Construction Jump Start Programme.\r\n\r\nThe  perception  that  there is  a  lack  of  innovation  and\r\n\r\ntechnological  applications in  our  industry  is  not  quite\r\n\r\ncorrect.  In fact, Dr Teo may be pleased to know that, in the\r\n\r\nlast  two years,  BCA has invested something like $9  million\r\n\r\nfor  20  R&D  projects in four strategic areas,  namely,  IT,\r\n\r\nbuildability,  technology,  building  performance  and  high-performance materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, both foreign and local construction\r\n\r\ncompanies  can  compete for our projects.   The  presence  of\r\n\r\nthese  foreign  companies  -  many of them  with  world-class\r\n\r\ncapabilities  -  have, over the years, set new standards  and\r\n\r\nchallenged   our  local  industries  to  upgrade   themselves\r\n\r\ntechnologically  and  to remain competitive.   HDB's  precast\r\n\r\ntechnology, for example, has attained quite a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreputation world wide.  Some local specialist companies  have\r\n\r\nalso  developed  niche skills such as reclamation  technology\r\n\r\nand marine engineering which can also be exported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be unwise to pick winners and offer them\r\n\r\ncontracts over and above contractors who offer good bids  for\r\n\r\nus.    Instead,  the  Government  will  provide  a  conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment  to  enable local firms to grow  and  upgrade  to\r\n\r\nglobal standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key strategy to raise standards and benchmarks\r\n\r\nfor  contractors is to revamp the Contractors Registry System\r\n\r\n(CRS).   From  1st July this year, companies registering  for\r\n\r\nCRS  will have to meet higher firm requirements for financial\r\n\r\ncapacity,  personnel  and  track record  to  reflect  current\r\n\r\nmarket   conditions.   The  requirement   of   one-third   of\r\n\r\nprofessional personnel be registered engineers or  architects\r\n\r\nwith  the  Professional  Engineers  Board  or  the  Board  of\r\n\r\nArchitects  has been introduced to strengthen  the  technical\r\n\r\nexpertise   of  construction  companies.   Given  that   most\r\n\r\nprojects are getting larger and more complex over the  years,\r\n\r\nthe  more  stringent criterion in the CRS will move firms  to\r\n\r\nupgrade and pool their resources with others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides CRS changes, the Government will also be making\r\n\r\nlegislative amendments to facilitate the formation  of  firms\r\n\r\nwith multi-disciplinary capabilities to allow them to provide\r\n\r\nthe full suite of services from design to build.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  more projects of an integrated nature like design-and-build will be pushed out to allow our local industry to  gain\r\n\r\nexperience in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while companies have strengthened their\r\n\r\ncapabilities  at  home,  BCA  and  IES  will  also   actively\r\n\r\nencourage  them  to  grow  their businesses  as  a  long-term\r\n\r\nstrategy.  There is a long-term export plan within  C  21  to\r\n\r\ngrow  our  industries and export them to the region.  BCA  is\r\n\r\nconcentrating  its efforts in cities like Beijing,  Shanghai,\r\n\r\nSichuan  in China, and Bangalore and Hyderabad in India.   In\r\n\r\nMarch last year, Chairman of BCA led a promotion mission\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  India.   Later  this  month, the  Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, Mr Mah, will personally lead a business  mission\r\n\r\nto China to promote the capabilities of our companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Teo for his idea of an\r\n\r\ninternational  advisory  panel to  develop  our  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.   Indeed, the Economic Review Committee is  looking\r\n\r\ninto  such ideas.  They are looking at reputable construction\r\n\r\ncompanies  in countries like South Korea, Japan  and  France,\r\n\r\nand  try to learn from them as to how to remake our industry.\r\n\r\nThe  Working  Group is still deliberating.  I  am  sure  some\r\n\r\ninteresting ideas will come out of this report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo raised a point about sustainable construction\r\n\r\nindustry.  I am happy to note that this is something the  BCA\r\n\r\nhas  been looking into in the last few years.  In two  years'\r\n\r\ntime,  all  companies on the top two grades of  the  new  CRS\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  be ISO 14000 certified.  To-date,  something\r\n\r\nlike  32 companies are already ISO 14000 certified, and  one-third of the companies on the top two grades, ie, the A1  and\r\n\r\nA2, are already ISO 14000 certified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public sector tender - this is an important subject\r\n\r\nraised by Mr Othman Eusofe and various MPs.  The concern that\r\n\r\nHDB  awards  tenders to the lowest price, regardless  of  the\r\n\r\nperformance of the contractors, is not quite correct.  It  is\r\n\r\nprecisely  for  this  reason that  we  have  the  Contractors\r\n\r\nRegistry System.  It is to sieve out unscrupulous contractors\r\n\r\nwho  have  a  bad  track record with any  of  the  Government\r\n\r\nagencies.  Price is an important consideration, but there are\r\n\r\nother  considerations, like track record, performance record,\r\n\r\nand  also recommendations from other Ministries.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary for any Ministry to award a contract based  on  the\r\n\r\nlowest price.  But since we already have a CRS, companies  on\r\n\r\nthat  list  are already pre-qualified.  In other words,  they\r\n\r\nare  not  so bad companies; very often, quite good companies.\r\n\r\nSo there is no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason for us to strike them out, unless there is a very firm\r\n\r\nbody of evidence to suggest that in the last few months, this\r\n\r\ncompany has gone bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the state of the construction industry, the industry\r\n\r\nhas  suffered from the downturn in the economy.   The  demand\r\n\r\nfor  private  and  public housing  has  gone  down.   So  the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry is at its crossroads.  But we are  sure\r\n\r\nthat  as the economy picks up, the construction industry will\r\n\r\nrise  from the ashes.  The revamped CRS is one approach taken\r\n\r\nby  the BCA to make sure that when good times come again,  we\r\n\r\nhave good contractors ready to catch the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I will be brief but\r\n\r\nflowery.   We all are very proud of our Garden City.   Having\r\n\r\ndone  a successful job in greening our country, we have added\r\n\r\nmore colours and we have also gone fruitful.  I think one  of\r\n\r\nthe  best drives of any airport in the world is the ECP,  and\r\n\r\nwe  are  proud  of  that.  Recently, I  was  invited  to  the\r\n\r\nlaunching  of  \"Adopt-A-Park\"  by  the  Telok  Kurau  Primary\r\n\r\nSchool.  I gladly accepted the invitation and went there, but\r\n\r\nonly  to  find out that the park actually belonged to another\r\n\r\nGRC.   Although I have the beautiful Bedok Reservoir Park  at\r\n\r\nneighbouring ward, belonging to BG George Yeo, and I am still\r\n\r\nproud  of it, I miss the Punggol Park from Punggol East where\r\n\r\nI  came from, from the last term.  I really miss Punggol Park\r\n\r\nas a landmark area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question here is, coming from Eunos, which is a very\r\n\r\nold  estate,  there we have more of a concrete jungle  rather\r\n\r\nthan  green.  So I would like to see the National Parks Board\r\n\r\nand Ministry of National Development spend some effort to see\r\n\r\nhow  they  can  help old estates, where they have  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nconcrete but less green, add some element of green lungs.  If\r\n\r\nthey  can look at even small corners here and there, and  get\r\n\r\nthe  National  Parks  Board to inject  some  freshness,  some\r\n\r\ngreen,  some colour and some fruits, I think life will  be  a\r\n\r\nlot more meaningful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, URA is one of the most\r\n\r\nimportant   land  utilisation  agencies  in  Singapore.    In\r\n\r\naddition, there are other agencies such as JTC, HDB  and  SLA\r\n\r\nwhich  have land utilisation programmes as well.  Very often,\r\n\r\nmore  than  one  agency  is  involved  with  regard  to   the\r\n\r\nutilisation for the very same piece of land.  This has caused\r\n\r\nproblems  for those who have purchased land from Government's\r\n\r\nland  sales  programmes or tenders.  As land is an  expensive\r\n\r\nresource  which will tie down the capital of many  investors,\r\n\r\nthere  is a need for Government agencies to coordinate  their\r\n\r\nrequirements and not be a hindrance to investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, a single Government agency should be formed for\r\n\r\nthe  purposes of land utilisation so that there can be better\r\n\r\ncoordination between URA, JTC, HDB and SLA.  This will  allow\r\n\r\nsmoother processing of administrative requirements and better\r\n\r\nmanagement of the supply of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Government should also consider reviewing\r\n\r\ndevelopment  charges.  The glut in commercial and  industrial\r\n\r\nspace has resulted in much space that has been left idle.  To\r\n\r\nimprove  productivity  and efficient  utilisation  of  space,\r\n\r\ncompanies  may have to reconsider change of use of  space  to\r\n\r\nimprove space usage and increase the chances of viability  of\r\n\r\nthe  business.  Whenever there is a change of use, they  have\r\n\r\nto  apply  to the relevant bodies like URA or SLA, which  may\r\n\r\nthen  charge  them  hefty  development  charges.   This  will\r\n\r\ndiscourage  the commercial space from being put  into  better\r\n\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodies like URA and SLA should not be overly concerned\r\n\r\nabout trying to squeeze the maximum out of every business  as\r\n\r\nthis  will only accelerate the demise of these companies  and\r\n\r\nthereafter,  result in a loss of jobs.  They should  exercise\r\n\r\nappropriate professional judgement, taking into account  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  there to make as much money as possible  from\r\n\r\ncommercial  companies, but rather they are  there  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  planning norms are adhered to and act according to  the\r\n\r\nprevailing  market  situation without  unduly  burdening  the\r\n\r\ncompanies.    To  incentivise  companies  to   utilise   idle\r\n\r\neconomically\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninactive  space, URA or other land agencies should, in  fact,\r\n\r\nconsider  giving  them a discount on the development  charges\r\n\r\nand allow these charges to be paid over a period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there is a need to increase transparency and\r\n\r\naccountability.  Land utilisation bodies must  also  be  more\r\n\r\ntransparent  and accountable and must not change  development\r\n\r\ncharges unilaterally.  They must tell the companies that  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment charges are for proposed building plans and  they\r\n\r\nshould  continue to revise development charges after approval\r\n\r\nhas  been  given.   Additional  charges  must  never  be   an\r\n\r\nafterthought.  A professional body, whether it  be  the  URA,\r\n\r\nSLA  or any other land utilisation agency, must refrain  from\r\n\r\npiling  charges.  We need a body beyond the land  utilisation\r\n\r\nagencies which can react quickly to resolve disputes whenever\r\n\r\nthey arise.  This dispute resolution body which hears appeals\r\n\r\nshould  be  empowered  to act quickly so  that  it  will  not\r\n\r\nincrease the cost of business of a Singapore company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a globalised environment, where the economic\r\n\r\nchallenges  to  Singapore are significant, our land  agencies\r\n\r\nmust be able to act professionally, be transparent, have high\r\n\r\nservice  standards and not be obstacles to  business  growth.\r\n\r\nIt is time for the agencies to adopt a new mindset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I would like to seek the following\r\n\r\nclarifications from the Minister:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What measures have been taken to increase the\r\n\r\nproduction of fish, eggs and vegetables in Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the status and production output of our\r\n\r\ndeep sea fish farm?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can the Ministry support high-rise farming in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low, we have less than six minutes\r\n\r\nfor your speech and the reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Thank you,\r\n\r\nMr Chairman, for the long time given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, food supply in Singapore depends almost fully on\r\n\r\nexternal sources, except only a small percentage on the high-tech   farms  in  Singapore.   Vegetables  come  mostly  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia;  fresh pork only from a small island  called  Pulau\r\n\r\nBulan  in  Indonesia; fresh chickens only from Malaysia;  and\r\n\r\nrice from Thailand.  Due to the dependence on limited sources\r\n\r\nof  supply, our food supply, in terms of quantity and  price,\r\n\r\nfluctuates.   The  famous  case was  the  ban  of  pork  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia due to the Nipah virus.  The price then increased by\r\n\r\nalmost double.  The increase in vegetable prices quite  often\r\n\r\ncould be due to the shortage of supply from Cameron Highlands\r\n\r\nbecause  of  bad weather, or it could be due to  the  ban  of\r\n\r\nimports because of the high level of pesticides being used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the ways to ensure less fluctuation of food\r\n\r\nsupply  and  also their prices is to depend  heavily  on  the\r\n\r\ndiversification of the sources of supply that we can develop.\r\n\r\nI notice that there were businessmen following the Minister's\r\n\r\nvisit  to Pekan Baru sometime ago, and the objective  of  the\r\n\r\nvisit was to develop a vegetable growing industry.  Singapore\r\n\r\nalso  signs a pact with Thailand to ensure priority of supply\r\n\r\nof  rice  to Singapore.  The Minister also visits Sichuan  in\r\n\r\norder to secure pork supply from China.  Recently, during the\r\n\r\nvisit  of  our Prime Minister to Thailand, it has  also  been\r\n\r\nannounced that there is a certain degree of agricultural food\r\n\r\nsupply collaboration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard so much and are excited about all this\r\n\r\npublicity,  but  we see very little from the results  of  all\r\n\r\nthese initiatives in diversifying our food supply.  Could the\r\n\r\nMinister enlighten us on the progress of all these projects?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue I would like to raise is regarding local\r\n\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low, I presume you do not want a\r\n\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

In the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecent case of a murder in a Lim Chu Kang farm, the authority\r\n\r\nthen  realised that the farm hired a large number of  illegal\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  The question is: why did it  hire  illegal\r\n\r\nforeign  workers?  In fact, MND, or the former  PPD  and  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  AVA, knew about the problem of shortage  of  labour.\r\n\r\nMND has either failed to convince MOM that such a project  is\r\n\r\nimportant or it is, as what other people have commented, that\r\n\r\nthe existence of all these high-tech farms is just to keep  a\r\n\r\npool  of  veterinary and agricultural experts to be hired  by\r\n\r\nAVA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry is\r\n\r\nserious  about the development of all these local  farms  and\r\n\r\nwhat  assistance  the Ministry will render  to  expedite  and\r\n\r\ndevelop all these projects announced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Balakrishnan, you have 21/2 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> As the sickle is about to be\r\n\r\nwielded,  I am only going to talk about farming.   Given  our\r\n\r\nland constraints, it is impossible for us to be self-reliant.\r\n\r\nOur  key is diversification.  I just want to remind the House\r\n\r\nthat  we  import vegetables from 32 countries, meat  from  25\r\n\r\ncountries  and  fish from 89 countries.  So we have  multiple\r\n\r\nsources  of  food.  The AVA seeks out and is continuously  on\r\n\r\nthe  lookout  for  new sources of food.  As we  identify  new\r\n\r\nsources, we try to transfer technology into these places.  As\r\n\r\nwe  try  to  transfer technology, we also look to  match-make\r\n\r\nthem  with our private sector so that funds from the  private\r\n\r\nsector  can  invest  in these agricultural  expeditions,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, shrimp and fish processing in Myanmar, Malaysia and\r\n\r\nVietnam,  shrimp  farming in Malaysia, vegetable  farming  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and  China, sea food processing  and,  of  course,\r\n\r\nfresh  pork supply in Australia.  You can see the nice photos\r\n\r\nof that in yesterday's newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to local farms, our objective is to provide\r\n\r\ntechnical advice to our farms because our farms cannot be the\r\n\r\nlow-tech  wide  expanses of farms which you see  in  overseas\r\n\r\ncountries.  They have to be high-tech and high-productivity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarms.   There are no current commercial deep net  cage  fish\r\n\r\nfarms  in  Singapore.  However, the AVA has just completed  a\r\n\r\nfour-year pilot project to show that it is feasible  to  have\r\n\r\ngood  quality  tropical fish in deep net cages  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwaters.   The main constraint, however, is the absence  of  a\r\n\r\nreliable supply of fries.  In this respect, I am glad to  say\r\n\r\nthat AVA has demonstrated that unlike human fertility, we are\r\n\r\npretty  good  at  fish fertility and we  have  been  able  to\r\n\r\nproduce  commercial quantities of fish fries  which  will  be\r\n\r\nessential ingredients for our deep net cage fish farming. So,\r\n\r\nDr Teo, take heart from that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards high-rise farming, there is obviously a limit\r\n\r\nas  to how much we can do.  We cannot put the farms on top of\r\n\r\nour   HDB  blocks.   They  cannot  take  the  weight  of  the\r\n\r\nirrigation  systems which will be needed.  However,  if  such\r\n\r\nhigh-rise  farms  indeed  are economically  viable,  and  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector is willing to bet and put money into it,  MND\r\n\r\nwill certainly facilitate this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. \"Guillotine\" time.

We have a very new Parliament House and  also  a\r\n\r\nnew  Speaker.   I  was fortunate enough to  be  sent  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Parliamentary Society (SPS) to the IPU Conference.\r\n\r\nThere,  I remember, at  one session, the head of a delegation\r\n\r\nfrom  Croatia  stood  up and started off by  apologising  and\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"I  apologise to the gentlemen who  are  present  here\r\n\r\ntoday.   Next  time,  we  will bring  some  male  members  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  Croatia.\"   It  so happened  that  all  the  three\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the delegation were female.  Sir, I expect  that\r\n\r\nmore  and more of such conferences will be attended by female\r\n\r\nparliamentarians.   I would like to see  that  Parliament  be\r\n\r\ngiven  more  resources to prepare itself for this  role.   We\r\n\r\nsuffer  from  bad breath from time to time.  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant that we are adequately represented in many  of  the\r\n\r\ninternational  conferences.  We have the IPU,  AIPO  and  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth   Parliamentary  Association.    I   hope   that\r\n\r\nnecessary resources should be given due attention, so that we\r\n\r\ncan  get  more  of  our Members to attend such  meetings  and\r\n\r\nconferences, and our image be enhanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also use this opportunity to show that we have\r\n\r\ndemocracy.   Many of the conferences are also represented  by\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Opposition.  Mr Chiam was with me in Morocco,\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Low Thia Khiang too had been with the former Speaker\r\n\r\nto  many  other conferences.  I hope Parliament will consider\r\n\r\nthe necessary resources in order to play an effective role at\r\n\r\noverseas conferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Deputy Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthe point that Mr Zainul Abidin made is a very important one,\r\n\r\nie, we should take every opportunity to enhance the image  of\r\n\r\nour  Parliament in international fora.  But let me assure him\r\n\r\nthat  this is indeed being done and Parliament is well  aware\r\n\r\nof this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last 12 months, for example, 48 MPs actually\r\n\r\nparticipated  in 16 overseas conferences, seminars,  official\r\n\r\nvisits  and  committees.  I have a list here which  indicates\r\n\r\nthat  the  conferences included those in Cuba, Burkina  Faso,\r\n\r\nNew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZealand,  Barbados,  KL, Beijing, Marrakech  in  Morocco  and\r\n\r\nmany, many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the expenditure that is incurred in respect of\r\n\r\nparticipating in these conferences and seminars  is  budgeted\r\n\r\nfor  in the Parliament vote.  And if there is a need to  have\r\n\r\nmore funds for such a purpose, I am sure that Parliament will\r\n\r\nallocate  more  funds for this purpose.  True to  Singapore's\r\n\r\nstyle,  we have not been extravagant in such expenditure,  as\r\n\r\nwe are not prone to giving MPs junket trips, but neither have\r\n\r\nwe  skimped on participation.  When we are invited, we assess\r\n\r\nwhether  we  can make a contribution and if  we  can  make  a\r\n\r\ncontribution, we have a role to play, we will go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our contribution has not been insignificant, if we judge\r\n\r\nby  the  role  that  we  are playing  in  these  conferences,\r\n\r\nconsidering the fact that we are a small state.  At  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  conferences,  we  are  represented  in  many  of   the\r\n\r\ncommittees.   We sit on the committees, for example,  in  the\r\n\r\nAssociation of Asian Parliaments for Peace (AAPP) meeting  in\r\n\r\nBeijing.    At  the  Annual  Meeting  of  the  Asia   Pacific\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Forum (APPF) in Honolulu, we were  represented\r\n\r\non  the  committee.   In  fact, we are  also  represented  on\r\n\r\nseveral   Standing   Committees,  and   this   includes   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth    Parliamentary    Association    (CPA),    the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  Speakers' Standing Committee and the  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsian Regional Branch of the CPA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will do our best, even though we are a small\r\n\r\nParliament,  to  be  represented  in  as  many  parliamentary\r\n\r\nconferences and committees as we can.  Our MPs are very  busy\r\n\r\npeople.   They have their own jobs to do, they have  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  their constituencies, and they have to carry out their\r\n\r\nparliamentary  duties.   Having said all that,  I  think  our\r\n\r\nParliamentarians acquit themselves creditably  in  all  these\r\n\r\noverseas  conferences, including our MPs from the  Opposition\r\n\r\nparties, Mr Chiam and Mr Low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul made special mention of the role of women MPs.\r\n\r\nHere,  I  am  pleased to inform him that the calibre  of  our\r\n\r\nwomen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMPs  has indeed been recognised by parliamentarians in  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  If I may cite several examples, recently, Mdm  Ho\r\n\r\nGeok  Choo served on one of the committees at the AAPP.   And\r\n\r\nlikewise, Ms Irene Ng had served on a committee at the  APPF.\r\n\r\nAt    the   AIPO   Conference   in   Thailand,   two    women\r\n\r\nparliamentarians, namely, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Dr  Lily  Neo,\r\n\r\nserved  on  several committees and panels,  including  WAIPO,\r\n\r\nwhich is the Women Parliamentarians of AIPO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are talking about the global image of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Parliament, there is the website that we  maintain\r\n\r\non  the  Internet.  There are also the Parliamentary  Reports\r\n\r\nthat we put up on the Internet and LawNet, and all these  are\r\n\r\naccessible  world wide.  We also hosted many attachments  and\r\n\r\nstudy   tours   for  Members  and  officials   from   foreign\r\n\r\nParliaments.   We have Parliamentary Friendship  Groups  with\r\n\r\nmany  other  countries like Australia, China,  Japan,  Korea,\r\n\r\nPeru,  etc,  and many of our Members here are  involved  with\r\n\r\nsuch groups.  We also have Regional Groups - West Asia group,\r\n\r\nAfrica  group,  Asia  Pacific group,  Southeast  Asia  group,\r\n\r\nEurope group, Americas group - which also involve many  other\r\n\r\nMPs.   And, finally, of course, what Mr Zainul mentioned just\r\n\r\nnow,  the Singapore Parliamentary Society (SPS), which  is  a\r\n\r\nsociety  which fosters relations with members of the CPA  and\r\n\r\nIPU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me just say that we appreciate the Member's\r\n\r\nconcern  about  upholding the global image of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nParliament.  I would like to assure him that we will bear  in\r\n\r\nmind  his  suggestion  for more women MPs  to  be  adequately\r\n\r\nrepresented at the relevant conferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zainul, would you like to withdraw\r\n\r\nyour amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I am very grateful for\r\n\r\nthe  long  reply given by Mr Mah.

No other faculty in NUS has such a quota.  There is no\r\n\r\nother highly ranked university in the world that denies entry\r\n\r\nto  qualified people on the basis of gender.  The reason  for\r\n\r\nintroducing  the quota for female medical students  was  that\r\n\r\nthe  attrition rate for female doctors prior to 1979 was  12-15%, and women doctors could not be assigned duties as freely\r\n\r\nas  their male counterparts.  However, these reasons are  not\r\n\r\nvalid  any  more.   Currently, the attrition  rate  for  male\r\n\r\ndoctors  is  2.8%  and for female doctors is  4.2%.   As  for\r\n\r\nduties  for doctors, women doctors have been assigned  duties\r\n\r\nas  men  have, without distinction.  They share  night  calls\r\n\r\nequally,  attend to the same number of patients  and  perform\r\n\r\nthe same medical and surgical procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is time to review the female quota for medical\r\n\r\nstudents now for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The latest statistics reveal that the attrition\r\n\r\nrate  is  not  significantly different for  male  and  female\r\n\r\ndoctors.   The figures show that 95.8% of female doctors  are\r\n\r\nstill working compared to 97.2% of male doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The percentage for women part-time doctors is 13.5%\r\n\r\nand   for   male   doctors  is  4.1%.    However,   part-time\r\n\r\npractitioners   are   still   contributing   to   Singapore's\r\n\r\nhealthcare  system and the use of part-time  is  an  entirely\r\n\r\narbitrary and self-declared status.  Women who work four full\r\n\r\ndays each\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nweek  may well declare themselves as part-timers whereas  men\r\n\r\nwho  take  two  or  three afternoons off a  week  will  still\r\n\r\nconsider themselves working full-time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Women live longer than men. Therefore, the higher\r\n\r\nnumber of non-working female doctors may be accounted for  in\r\n\r\npart,  by  the higher number of retired women doctors.   This\r\n\r\nmay  also  mean  that the working life of  women  doctors  is\r\n\r\nlonger  and hence total productivity over their lifetime  may\r\n\r\nequal or exceed that of their male colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Both male and female doctors serve their compulsory\r\n\r\nfive-year  bond  for  newly qualified doctors.   This  should\r\n\r\ncount  as  partial  fulfilment of their responsibilities  for\r\n\r\ntheir  educational subsidy.  Even allowing  for  the  greater\r\n\r\nsocial   responsibilities  of  doctors  whose   training   is\r\n\r\nsubsidised, it seems illogical that doctors should be singled\r\n\r\nout  and  expected to be \"serving\" in the medical  profession\r\n\r\nfor  life.   No  other  professional faculty,  or  Government\r\n\r\nscholarship  programme, has a similar quota on women.   Thus,\r\n\r\nthe   quota  appears  to  rest  on  an  unreasonable  \"moral\"\r\n\r\nobligation on all doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Studies in other countries have shown that due to\r\n\r\nbetter communication skills of female doctors, mothers prefer\r\n\r\nto  take their young children to see women doctors whom  they\r\n\r\nfeel  may interact and empathise better with children as well\r\n\r\nas  with  themselves,  as  women and  mothers.   Since  women\r\n\r\ncomprise  more than 50% of the population in Singapore,  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  be denied access to sufficient women doctors  to\r\n\r\ncater to their needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Many of the qualified female students who were\r\n\r\nrejected by NUS have gone abroad to study medicine.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthem get married and stay on to work there.  As a result,  we\r\n\r\nlose highly skilled talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) With the strong push for the life sciences\r\n\r\nindustry,  Singapore needs better trained personnel  who  can\r\n\r\nbridge the gap between the pure scientist in the industry and\r\n\r\nthe medical practitioner.  Women doctors would be well placed\r\n\r\nto take up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese jobs, as such jobs have more regular working hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore prides itself on being a meritocratic\r\n\r\nsociety.  On this issue, our women are only asking for  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment in the competition to enter medical school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on ElderShield. It was announced\r\n\r\nlast  year that ElderShield, the national insurance  plan  to\r\n\r\nhelp  older  people  who  become  disabled,  will  start   in\r\n\r\nSeptember  this  year.  While I welcome help  for  the  older\r\n\r\ndisabled,  I would like to raise some of the inadequacies  of\r\n\r\nthis proposed national insurance plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opt-out scheme will entitle a subscriber to draw\r\n\r\n$300 a month for up to five years if the subscriber is unable\r\n\r\nto  carry  out  unaided  at  least  three  of  the  following\r\n\r\nactivities:  eating, bathing, walking, dressing,  getting  up\r\n\r\nand  going  to  the toilet.  I would say that application  of\r\n\r\nsuch  criteria means that the subscriber is, in fact, totally\r\n\r\ndependent on another person daily.  Sir, may I ask  then  how\r\n\r\nsuch a person can survive with $300 per month?  The situation\r\n\r\nwill  be even worse for those who are less well-off and  have\r\n\r\nno  other savings.  Those who do not look into the details of\r\n\r\nthe  plan  may,  in fact, get a false sense of  security  and\r\n\r\nthink  that their old age woes will be taken care of by  this\r\n\r\nnational insurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of cases of severe disability are the\r\n\r\nresult  of diseases, such as stroke and so on.  Sir,  usually\r\n\r\nthis  means  that the dependent elderly will also need  long-term  medications  on an outpatient basis.   At  the  moment,\r\n\r\npatients  can  only  claim from Medisave  or  MediShield  for\r\n\r\nmedical care if they are warded in hospitals.  A tendency for\r\n\r\npatients  to opt for institutional care, costing as  much  as\r\n\r\n$120  per day, therefore arises.  It is really a pity if  any\r\n\r\nnational insurance scheme does not address this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always the argument that higher disbursements\r\n\r\nand  coverage  will mean higher premium  at  the  outset.   I\r\n\r\naccept  this  argument, but I also feel that it is  not  much\r\n\r\ngood  having  an insurance plan that cannot adequately  serve\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  it is intended for.  I am sure the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  has the statistics and resources to better  plan  and\r\n\r\npackage  a  really  sound  scheme.  The  probability  of  our\r\n\r\nGovernment subsidising the premium, especially for  the  poor\r\n\r\nand/or  non-working, must be on the cards.  Sir, in  view  of\r\n\r\nour  fast-aging population, it is better to help with a small\r\n\r\noutlay  in terms of insurance premium at the outset  than  to\r\n\r\ncarry  the  heavy burdens later.  A Government  subsidy  will\r\n\r\nalso  reduce  the  percentage  of  those  opting  out.   More\r\n\r\nattention should be paid to the less well-off in our society.\r\n\r\nIn  relation  to  family income, some sort of cut-off  point,\r\n\r\nbelow  which a subsidy for higher disbursements may be given,\r\n\r\nwould also be a reasonable consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Health can reconsider the\r\n\r\nimplementation   of  ElderShield  with  the   above-mentioned\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I agree that the ElderShield\r\n\r\nscheme  is a good scheme, and it will help older Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  truly deserve something in return.  But I have a  couple\r\n\r\nof  issues  to raise with regard to the application  of  this\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I find that the scheme has too many conditions\r\n\r\nand  appear to have restricted application.  To benefit  from\r\n\r\nit,  an  elderly Singaporean will actually have to be  almost\r\n\r\nbed-ridden.  This is because it applies to those  who  cannot\r\n\r\ndo  at  least three of the following: they cannot move, feed,\r\n\r\ntransfer, dress, wash or go to the toilet unassisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the elderly person's claims can be disputed by\r\n\r\na  joint panel of assessors and, if there is a dispute,  then\r\n\r\nthe elderly person will have to engage his own doctor, at his\r\n\r\nown  expense, to dispute the assessment made by the insurance\r\n\r\ncompany's  panel  of doctors.  Most of the  elderly  disabled\r\n\r\nwill not be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nable  to  afford  paying for this extra cost.   In  order  to\r\n\r\nensure greater objectivity, I would like to suggest that  MOH\r\n\r\nappoint  the  assessors  instead  of  leaving  this  to   the\r\n\r\ninsurance companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, those with pre-existing disabilities and those\r\n\r\nabove  69 years of age will not be covered.  True, they  will\r\n\r\nbe covered under the IDAPE, but this scheme covers only those\r\n\r\nwith  household  income not exceeding $700-1,000  per  month,\r\n\r\nwhich is very low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, the scheme provides payment for only up\r\n\r\nto  five  years.  Beyond that, the disabled elderly  will  be\r\n\r\nunprotected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister to be more flexible and to review\r\n\r\nall  these  restrictive qualifying conditions,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nElderShield scheme can be more effective and can  cover  more\r\n\r\nelderly Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister what more can be\r\n\r\ndone  to  facilitate  the development of  step-down  care  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  so  that disabled elderly Singaporeans  can  have\r\n\r\nmore  proper home care and community-based services; in other\r\n\r\nwords,  providing this ElderShield scheme should be  but  one\r\n\r\nfacet of a holistic scheme of caring for the needs of elderly\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, as the ElderShield is an opt-out scheme, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to know what measures the Ministry would take  to\r\n\r\neducate the public not to opt out of the scheme, as they  may\r\n\r\nnot need it now but will do so as they grow older.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, our healthcare\r\n\r\nsystem  is based on Medisave, MediShield and Medifund.   They\r\n\r\nreflect  the principles of individual responsibility  through\r\n\r\nMedisave  savings,  shared risk-pooling  through  MediShield,\r\n\r\nwith the Government providing a universal layer of safety net\r\n\r\nthrough   Medifund.    These  three   schemes   ensure   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will have access to quality medical care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a way, the MediShield scheme is a portable\r\n\r\nscheme that has a wide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncoverage.   Although it has been continuously fine-tuned  and\r\n\r\nimproved after it was implemented in July 1990, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  find  out  if  the Ministry plans to enhance  the  scheme\r\n\r\nfurther.  I have four specific suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, bring more Singaporeans under MediShield\r\n\r\ncoverage.  The scheme is voluntary and Singaporeans  can  opt\r\n\r\nout  of  it.  I understand that quite a big number of  people\r\n\r\nhave actually opted out.  Should we make it compulsory?  What\r\n\r\nis  the  number  of  Singaporeans  who  are  not  covered  by\r\n\r\nMediShield  or  any  of  the approved CPF  medical  insurance\r\n\r\nschemes?   What  more can be done to bring more  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nunder such coverage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, include enhanced coverage of non-working spouse\r\n\r\nand  children.  This will allow a CPF account holder to cover\r\n\r\nhis wife and the whole family under the insurance scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, under the present system, the older members have\r\n\r\nto  pay  a higher premium.  Would the Ministry consider  pre-funding features for the MediShield scheme?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, enlarging the pool of approved medical insurance\r\n\r\nschemes,  so  that more insurers can build portable  features\r\n\r\ninto   the   basic   schemes.   This  will   facilitate   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  portable medical  benefits.   Apart  from\r\n\r\nMediShield,  would  the  Ministry  consider  more   Medisave-approved   medical  insurance  schemes  offered  by   private\r\n\r\ninsurers  to  make  the  proposed portable  medical  benefits\r\n\r\nscheme more responsive to their needs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nMediShield  scheme was introduced in 1990 to  complement  the\r\n\r\nMedisave  scheme in helping Singaporeans meet  their  medical\r\n\r\nexpenses  from  major  and  prolonged  illnesses,  which  the\r\n\r\nMedisave alone may not have sufficient balances to cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MediShield is an important safety net to ensure\r\n\r\nthat Singaporeans will not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  denied critical medical treatment when they are  suddenly\r\n\r\nstruck by chronic illnesses which may require protracted  and\r\n\r\ncostly  treatment.  It is a risk-pooling mechanism to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe overall cost of obtaining medical treatment for those who\r\n\r\nare unfortunate enough to need it.  It is, therefore, crucial\r\n\r\nthat  all  Singaporeans are covered  under  the  scheme.   I,\r\n\r\ntherefore, share the same sentiment as Mr Yeo Guat Kwang that\r\n\r\nwe  should  encourage all Singaporeans  to  come  under  this\r\n\r\nscheme.   Otherwise,  when  they cannot  afford  the  medical\r\n\r\ntreatment  they  need,  they  will  invariably  turn  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for help.  I would, therefore, like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether his Ministry has plans to  encourage  those\r\n\r\nwho  are not yet covered under the scheme to sign up for  the\r\n\r\nscheme as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main setbacks of the MediShield scheme really\r\n\r\nis  that  it is an insurance scheme and, as such, the premium\r\n\r\nthat  is  paid is not recoverable.  For a person who  remains\r\n\r\nhealthy,  he  actually gets nothing in return.   Perhaps  one\r\n\r\ncould  argue  that his greatest return is his  health.   This\r\n\r\nperspective  is not wrong. But we should still  ask:  is  the\r\n\r\nscheme  cost-effective?  Therefore, I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether he could let us know how much  premium  has\r\n\r\nbeen collected over the last five years and how much has  the\r\n\r\ntotal pay-out been.  If there is a significant surplus,  then\r\n\r\nwould  it  be  possible  to  either  reduce  the  premium  to\r\n\r\nencourage  more  Singaporeans to sign on, or to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nscheme without increasing the premium?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we continue to enhance the MediShield scheme, I\r\n\r\nam not sure we can afford to always do so without raising the\r\n\r\npremium.  I believe that there is no free lunch and  we  will\r\n\r\nneed to raise the premium at some point in time.  However, it\r\n\r\nis  important that the premium remains affordable, especially\r\n\r\nfor  the  lower income group, as they need it most.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to urge the Minister to ensure that future increases  in\r\n\r\nthe premium, if any, should take into account affordability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, in 1993, the Government\r\n\r\npublished  the  White  Paper  on  affordable  healthcare   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Despite this, Singaporeans today remain concerned\r\n\r\nabout  the affordability of healthcare.  There is some  basis\r\n\r\nfor  this concern as, on average, healthcare costs have  been\r\n\r\nincreasing  at  the  rate of 6% per year.   Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nasking  what  are  the main causes for the increase,  and  is\r\n\r\nthere  no control on such increase in costs?  Is the increase\r\n\r\nin  costs  due to the increased salaries and fees of  doctors\r\n\r\nand  specialists  due  to  the need for  the  Government  and\r\n\r\nrestructured hospitals to catch up with the private  sector's\r\n\r\npay  scales  and  fees?  If so, then, surely, some  long-term\r\n\r\nsolutions  will  have  to be found, such  as  increasing  the\r\n\r\nsupply of such specialists or providing more competition  for\r\n\r\nspecialist care in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is the rising cost of healthcare in Singapore due to\r\n\r\nimprovements in medical technology?  If new technology is the\r\n\r\nculprit,  then I am a little bit puzzled as to why the  logic\r\n\r\nthat prevailed in the case of new technology in other sectors\r\n\r\ndid  not  apply  in  the medical services.   If  we  look  at\r\n\r\ntechnology in other sectors, such as computers, for instance,\r\n\r\nwe  will  see  that, over time, the price of such  technology\r\n\r\ninvariably goes down.  So, should not one expect the same for\r\n\r\nmedical technology?  The new products will be expensive  but,\r\n\r\nover  time,  the  same product should be  cheaper,  and  this\r\n\r\nshould  translate into cheaper medical costs.   At  the  very\r\n\r\nleast,  it  should not be cited as a reason  to  justify  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  medical costs.  Also, on the point of technology,\r\n\r\nis  there any control over new technology that is being  used\r\n\r\nto  determine whether they are really necessary, or just good\r\n\r\nto have?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans are also asking, and they want to\r\n\r\nknow,  whether all these big hospital buildings that  we  now\r\n\r\nsee  are adding to the increasing costs.  For instance,  will\r\n\r\nit  not  cost more to maintain these buildings and keep  them\r\n\r\nclean,  compared to the minimalist and spartan  hospitals  of\r\n\r\nold?   After all, what anyone who goes to the hospital  wants\r\n\r\nis  good and affordable medical care, and he/she will be  too\r\n\r\nsick to appreciate the wonderful ambience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister could throw some light on\r\n\r\nthis  very fundamental issue of why our healthcare costs  are\r\n\r\nincreasing,  and what productivity and control measures  have\r\n\r\nbeen  put  in  place to prevent the spiralling of  healthcare\r\n\r\ncosts  in Singapore.  Would the Minister consider setting  up\r\n\r\nan  audit committee, a body, for instance, comprising  health\r\n\r\neconomists  and members of the public, to audit increases  in\r\n\r\nhealthcare costs in Singapore similar to the role  played  by\r\n\r\nthe Public Transport Council?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister whether with the\r\n\r\naverage  6% yearly increase in healthcare costs, the  current\r\n\r\nMedisave  contribution rate will be sufficient  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nmedical  needs of Singaporeans.  The Ministry of  Health  has\r\n\r\nexplained  before that the Medisave amount is sufficient  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   to  pay  for  about  10   or   11   bouts   of\r\n\r\nhospitalisation.  Could the Minister enlighten the  House  as\r\n\r\nto  whether in making this estimation, the Ministry has taken\r\n\r\ninto  account the fact that many Singaporeans today  are  not\r\n\r\ntaking care of only their own hospitalisation needs, but they\r\n\r\nalso  have  to provide for elderly parents who  do  not  have\r\n\r\nMedisave savings of their own?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the truth of the matter is also that, today, those\r\n\r\nwho feel the most pressurised are those in the middle income,\r\n\r\nas  the poor and the lower income have a lot of assistance in\r\n\r\nthe  form  of  grants and subsidies from the  Government.   I\r\n\r\nwould  appreciate  a response to these issues  which  I  have\r\n\r\nraised for the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I share the concern of\r\n\r\nrising  healthcare cost, as highlighted by the  hon.  Member,\r\n\r\nMdm Halimah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, healthcare cost is rising because of several\r\n\r\nfactors,  such  as  aging  population,  introduction  of  new\r\n\r\nmedical technology, use of newer drugs which are still  under\r\n\r\npatents  and,  therefore, the cheaper generic drugs  are  not\r\n\r\navailable,  increasing  demand of better-informed  customers,\r\n\r\nie,  the  patients  themselves or their  family,  and  rising\r\n\r\nlabour costs.  May I urge the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  to  look  at the ways to contain  the  rising  cost\r\n\r\nbefore passing them on to the patients and their family?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to paying bills, our healthcare financing\r\n\r\npolicy  has  always  been to rely on co-payment  to  minimise\r\n\r\nabuse and wastage of our healthcare resources.  This is  well\r\n\r\nand  good.   However, I am concerned that  in  our  haste  to\r\n\r\nrecover costs and to balance the budget, perhaps we have been\r\n\r\npricing our healthcare costs too high to the patients, beyond\r\n\r\nthe  affordability  of some of them.  I feel  that  a  bigger\r\n\r\nburden  has been passed on to the patients and their  family,\r\n\r\nsometimes more than they can afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point to note is that MOH has actually introduced\r\n\r\nmeans  testing for step-down care services, such  as  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes and chronic sick hospitals.  It will apply to community\r\n\r\nhospital  patients in July this year and I  understand  that,\r\n\r\neventually, all acute hospital patients will also  be  means-tested.   Here,  I  must first declare  my  interest  as  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Director of Ren Ci Hospital, which will  be  opening\r\n\r\nits  200-bedded community hospital this year.  I  agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  principle of means testing, so that the poorer  patients\r\n\r\nactually get more subsidies while the better-off should  bear\r\n\r\na bigger burden of their medical bills.  However, I find that\r\n\r\nour   policy  to  subvent  only  the  poorer  half   of   the\r\n\r\npopulation's healthcare will make it unaffordable to many who\r\n\r\nare  caught  in  between.   Under  the  means-testing  for  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  hospital, for example, only the poorer  half  will\r\n\r\nget  the Government's subvention between 25% and 75%  of  the\r\n\r\ncost.   The cut-off is per capita household income  of  about\r\n\r\n$1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate my point using a very simple example.\r\n\r\nThe  norm cost of a \"C\" class in a community hospital's  stay\r\n\r\nis  about  $200 per day, and the average length  of  stay  is\r\n\r\nabout  four weeks.  The average cost per hospital  stay  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  about $5,600.  Using our national  statistics,\r\n\r\nthe median household income is about $3,600.   So if one is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunlucky and probably has about $5,000 household income,  most\r\n\r\nlikely,  he would not pass this means test and he would  have\r\n\r\nto  bear  the  whole amount, which is more than  one  month's\r\n\r\nincome of the whole household.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for those who just pass the means test and are\r\n\r\neligible for 25% subvention, 75% of $5,600 would mean a hefty\r\n\r\nbill  of  $4,200.  Compare this to the existing system  which\r\n\r\nallows the patients to choose the class they wish to stay, if\r\n\r\nthey  stay  in \"C\" class, they will get 80% of the subsidies.\r\n\r\nI  feel that more people will be left out with this new means\r\n\r\ntest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nreconsider the policy of subventing only the poorer  half  of\r\n\r\nthe  population.   Precisely because the healthcare  cost  is\r\n\r\nrising, more people are in need of subsidised healthcare.   I\r\n\r\nwould urge the Ministry to grant more subventions to patients\r\n\r\nand to make our healthcare more affordable.  Otherwise, I  am\r\n\r\nafraid the coffeeshop talk of \"can die, cannot sick\" may  one\r\n\r\nday come true, which I certainly do not hope to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  points  I  wish to raise on this amendment are  somewhat\r\n\r\nsimilar  to what my parliamentary colleagues before  me  have\r\n\r\njust mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been said to come a long way in improving\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of  health  and  providing  good  medical  and\r\n\r\nhealthcare services to its people. Today, the state of health\r\n\r\nof   the  people  in  Singapore  has  attained  international\r\n\r\nstandard.   In  1993,  a  White  Paper  entitled  \"Affordable\r\n\r\nHealthcare\"  was  published, spelling  out  the  Government's\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  provide good affordable basic  healthcare  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  This is done through the provision of  heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised  medical  services  in  Government  hospitals  and\r\n\r\npolyclinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1990s, the Government hospitals were\r\n\r\nrestructured with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobjective of providing quality medical services comparable to\r\n\r\nthe  private  hospitals.   In  1999,  the  public  healthcare\r\n\r\ndelivery  system was reorganised into two vertical  groups  - National Healthcare Group and the Singapore Health Services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the suggestions of the Remaking Committee is to\r\n\r\ndevelop Singapore into a medical hub.  This kind of foresight\r\n\r\nand  spontaneity is a driving force in sustaining  our  long-term  survival.  As our colleagues have said,  we  have  been\r\n\r\nconstantly introducing more advanced medical technologies  to\r\n\r\nSingapore   to  further  enhance  our  healthcare  standards.\r\n\r\nHowever,  my  concern is whether this will cause our  medical\r\n\r\ncost to go up even further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, rising expectations of our people for better\r\n\r\nmedical  and  healthcare services may also be a  contributing\r\n\r\nfactor to our escalating medical cost.   But a  lot of people\r\n\r\nare saying that the Government is trying to recover its cost,\r\n\r\neven  the   cost of building hospitals, and that is the  main\r\n\r\nreason for raising the medical fees!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am raising this issue because our healthcare\r\n\r\ndelivery system is based on individual's responsibility  plus\r\n\r\nGovernment  subsidy  to  make the  basic  healthcare  service\r\n\r\naffordable. The medical expenses keep going up, very soon the\r\n\r\nlower-income group and the elderly in our population will not\r\n\r\nbe able to afford them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One resident in my Constituency, who is a hypertension\r\n\r\npatient, told me that when he was taking the medication  from\r\n\r\nthe polyclinics in Singapore, it would cost him $1-2 per day.\r\n\r\nBut when he bought the same medicine from Johor Baru, he paid\r\n\r\nonly 60 cents for it.  He told me that he had been taking the\r\n\r\ncheaper medicine he bought from Johor for the last two years.\r\n\r\nHe is happy and he is still alive and kicking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether there is some\r\n\r\nform  of control on the prices of medicine sold in Singapore.\r\n\r\nSince  we are controlling the type of medicines that  can  be\r\n\r\nsold  in  Singapore, can we not also check on the  prices  at\r\n\r\nwhich they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing sold to the end consumers?   If these medicines can  be\r\n\r\nsold at Johor Baru at much lower prices, why cannot something\r\n\r\nbe  done to ensure that our retailers sell these medicines at\r\n\r\ncomparable prices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich people, of course, can go to expensive, air-conditioned hospitals and enjoy the comfort there. For the\r\n\r\npoorer  patients, they can only go to a third-class hospital.\r\n\r\nThe rich people take expensive ginseng and bird's nest, but a\r\n\r\npoor  man  can  settle for an inexpensive  glass  of  soybean\r\n\r\ndrink.  Can we not allow some form of generic medicines  with\r\n\r\nthe  same therapeutic effect to be sold in Singapore, so that\r\n\r\nthe  people  in the lower income group could find  them  more\r\n\r\naffordable?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Ong has just mentioned that Singaporeans like\r\n\r\nto say, \"you can die, but you cannot afford to be sick here\".\r\n\r\nWe  should  give the people the impression that in Singapore,\r\n\r\neven when you are sick, you will not die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, affordable healthcare\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  key  policy  of the PAP Government.   Medisave,\r\n\r\nMediShield  and Medifund (3M framework) have been  the  three\r\n\r\nmain  pillars of our health payment schemes.  I am glad  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry will be improving on the 3M framework, a review\r\n\r\nthat is long overdue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary healthcare services continue to be affordable\r\n\r\nfor  most  Singaporeans  due to the significant  presence  of\r\n\r\ngeneral practitioners in the HDB heartlands together with the\r\n\r\npolyclinics.  This has resulted in a very affordable  primary\r\n\r\nhealthcare  system.  It is when Singaporeans go to  hospitals\r\n\r\nthat their cost start to escalate.  This is not unexpected in\r\n\r\nhospitals  where  highly-trained staff, expensive  up-to-date\r\n\r\nequipment,  well-trained specialists and  branded  drugs  are\r\n\r\ncommonly  used.  What the Ministry needs to do is  to  review\r\n\r\nthe  3M  framework  to help Singaporeans  meet  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nhospitalisation and outpatient specialist care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicine has come a long way, where in the past, heart\r\n\r\ndisease, kidney failure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  cancer  spelt  a dismal outcome or even  death  for  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Modern  medicine  has  enabled  many  to   be\r\n\r\ntreated,  with  a good quality of life. The only  problem  is\r\n\r\ncost.    As  such, the Ministry should consider allowing  the\r\n\r\nuse  of Medisave for diagnosis or management of major chronic\r\n\r\nillnesses,  on  an  outpatient basis.   This  should  include\r\n\r\nconditions  like  heart disease, kidney failure,  cancer  and\r\n\r\ndiabetes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medisave withdrawal limit, for many of the\r\n\r\nprocedures done in the hospitals, has not been revised for  a\r\n\r\nvery,  very long time.  As a result, many of these procedures\r\n\r\nthat have become routine, have not been adequately covered by\r\n\r\nthe  Medisave  withdrawal limit.  It is time  for  it  to  be\r\n\r\nreviewed.   For most patients, the last six months  of  their\r\n\r\nlives  is  the  period when their medical bill  will  be  the\r\n\r\nhighest.   MediShield should be revised to  provide  adequate\r\n\r\ncoverage  for major catastrophic illnesses and to  take  into\r\n\r\naccount this fact as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is important that our public health\r\n\r\ninstitutions must realise that their aim is not to make money\r\n\r\nfrom Singaporeans.  I wish to quote a case which has troubled\r\n\r\nmy heart greatly.  A resident had come to see me at the meet-the-people  session because his child was born  premature  in\r\n\r\nMount  Alvernia  Hospital  and required  intensive  care  and\r\n\r\nsurgical  treatment.   He sought my assistance  to  have  the\r\n\r\nchild  transferred to KK Hospital.  KK Hospital's  specialist\r\n\r\ntold  him  that the child needed surgery that  could  not  be\r\n\r\nperformed  in Mount Alvernia but only in KK Hospital.   After\r\n\r\ntheir   appeal,  KK  Hospital  agreed  to  have  the  patient\r\n\r\ntransferred to them provided that the family put up a $20,000\r\n\r\ndeposit to the hospital.  The young couple was at their wits'\r\n\r\nend and had to borrow the $20,000 from friends and relatives.\r\n\r\nJust  when they thought they had solved the problem and  they\r\n\r\nwent  to  the  hospital,  they were told  by  the  hospital's\r\n\r\nadministrators, \"No, no, not enough.  Now we need $60,000  as\r\n\r\na  deposit  before we are willing to take your  child\".  They\r\n\r\ncame to see me, utterly devastated.  Finally, the patient was\r\n\r\ntaken   only  when  Mount  Alvernia  Hospital  had  given   a\r\n\r\nguarantee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder how this event would have turned out if Mount\r\n\r\nAlvernia  Hospital did not provide a guarantee.   Our  public\r\n\r\nhospitals have rallied to the cause of foreign patients  with\r\n\r\npoor  prognosis, such as in the widely publicised surgery  of\r\n\r\nthe   Siamese   twins   and   the   Indonesian   child   with\r\n\r\nhydrocephalus.    Would   our  public   hospitals   let   the\r\n\r\nSingaporean baby suffer and perhaps, even perish, as long  as\r\n\r\nthe  parents were not able to raise the money or no  one  was\r\n\r\nable  to provide a guarantee?  Are Singaporeans to be  denied\r\n\r\naccess  to  our public activities because they are unable  to\r\n\r\nmeet the high fees demanded of them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final letter I got from the hospital was that if I\r\n\r\nwished  to  pursue the case further, I should know  that  the\r\n\r\nhospital was a cost centre, and economic consideration was an\r\n\r\nimportant  factor.   I am extremely saddened  by  the  entire\r\n\r\nincident and I hope it does not signal a policy shift in  our\r\n\r\npublic hospitals.  Can the Minister reassure all Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat  they have a right of access to taxpayers' funded public\r\n\r\nhospitals  and  affordability will never be  the  reason  for\r\n\r\ndenying them admission to a public hospital?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, the Medifund was an endowment\r\n\r\nfund  set  up  by  the Government in 1993.  With  an  initial\r\n\r\ncapital  of  $200  million, the fund has now  grown  to  $800\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of $27 million has been disbursed in 2001, out\r\n\r\nof  $30 million available.  This represents a 90% utilisation\r\n\r\nrate.  This implies that the fund has been well utilised  and\r\n\r\nhas  served its purpose of helping the lower-income  families\r\n\r\ncope with their healthcare cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am rather concerned, like other MPs before\r\n\r\nme, with the consistent increase in healthcare costs.  If  we\r\n\r\nlook  at the Economic Survey which was distributed last week,\r\n\r\nat  page  98,  there  is a table showing the  consumer  price\r\n\r\nindex, broken down by categories.  First quarter 2002 saw the\r\n\r\noverall CPI decline\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  0.9%  over  the  same quarter in the previous  year.   In\r\n\r\ncontrast,  healthcare cost increased by 2.4%  over  the  same\r\n\r\nperiod.   The  healthcare category has the  highest  rate  of\r\n\r\nincrease.  If we take the whole of 2001 compared to the  year\r\n\r\n2000, the overall CPI increased by 1%, while healthcare costs\r\n\r\nincreased by 3.3%, more than three times.  Again, it  is  the\r\n\r\nhighest  category.   If  we take a longer  time  horizon  and\r\n\r\ncompare  2001 with 1997, the overall CPI increased  by  2.1%,\r\n\r\nwhile  healthcare  costs went up by 10%, almost  five  times,\r\n\r\nover the last four years.  Again, it is the highest category.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  the  quality of healthcare services  has  improved.\r\n\r\nBut  we  need to keep in mind the affordability of healthcare\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even when the economy recovers, the job situation\r\n\r\nwill  remain weak for some time, as the same Economic  Survey\r\n\r\nhas already pointed out.  Unemployment will worsen before  it\r\n\r\nimproves. Wages are likely to be further reduced.  Given this\r\n\r\nlikely scenario, Sir, our people would be very concerned with\r\n\r\nthe  rising  healthcare costs.  I am glad that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  promised  that it will absorb the proposed GST  increase\r\n\r\nfor healthcare services.  But if healthcare cost continues to\r\n\r\nrise,  it will negate the goodwill gesture of the Government.\r\n\r\nI  would,  therefore, like to urge the Government to  monitor\r\n\r\nthe  situation  and  take  steps  to  contain  the  rise   in\r\n\r\nhealthcare costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in healthcare costs over the last few\r\n\r\nyears, coupled with the unemployment and wage reduction,  may\r\n\r\nalso  result  in  more people needing help  for  their  basic\r\n\r\nhealthcare services.  It is, therefore, important for  us  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  our basic safety net, such as the Medifund,  is\r\n\r\nadequate in responding to the needs of the people.  The  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  utilisation  rate of  Medifund  is  high  is  also\r\n\r\nevidence that perhaps more people would need help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nexpanding  the  Medifund  scheme to meet  the  greater  needs\r\n\r\narising from higher healthcare costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VISIT OF THE HON.

It  was a significant step to  bring  affordable\r\n\r\nhealthcare  closer  to low-income elderly Singaporeans.   The\r\n\r\nimplementation was unfortunately not given enough  publicity.\r\n\r\nNot many people know about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As other MPs have mentioned, the general impression\r\n\r\namong the people, particularly the old folks, is that primary\r\n\r\nhealthcare  is  very  expensive and not  easily   accessible.\r\n\r\nSome are even afraid to seek treatment when they are sick. It\r\n\r\nis  therefore  necessary to allay their fears so that they do\r\n\r\nnot  have  to  worry so much about having to  pay  exorbitant\r\n\r\nmedical  fees that deters them from going to the doctor  when\r\n\r\nthey are sick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite two examples. The ElderShield scheme will be\r\n\r\nlaunched  later  this  year. It is an  affordable  disability\r\n\r\ninsurance   scheme  that  provides  insurance   coverage   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  aged  40 years and above who require  long-term\r\n\r\ncare. It is a significant step in looking after the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmedical  needs  of elderly Singaporeans. However,  after  the\r\n\r\ninitial   coverage  over  the  media  when  the  scheme   was\r\n\r\nannounced,  we  have not heard anything about it  thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe  vast majority of our elderly people in Singapore do  not\r\n\r\nknow about the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Ministry of Health and the Health\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board's websites have a wealth of  useful  health-related  information.  For example, I found useful  materials\r\n\r\nsuch  as  \"Ten  Tips to Stretch Your Health  Dollar\",  and  a\r\n\r\nsection   dedicated   to  elderly   health    issues.    This\r\n\r\ninformation must not just sit in the websites. There must  be\r\n\r\nsome ways to bring them to the elderly Singaporeans and, more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  to their families.  No doubt,  there  are  many\r\n\r\npeople,  particularly the elderly ones, who are not  computer\r\n\r\nsavvy.  They cannot make full use of this service. I urge the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health to do more to reach out to these  elderly\r\n\r\npeople  and  their families and educate them on such  health-related issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, I must first declare\r\n\r\nthat I am a doctor in private practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare in Singapore is at the crossroads. The White\r\n\r\nPaper on Affordable Healthcare set the policy directions  for\r\n\r\nthe 1990s.  Notably, there was no emphasis on Singapore as  a\r\n\r\ncentre  of  medical excellence.  The present decade  shows  a\r\n\r\nmarked  shift  in  the  direction of our  healthcare  policy.\r\n\r\nWhile  still  holding  on  to  the  principle  of  affordable\r\n\r\nhealthcare, the public healthcare system has now set  on  two\r\n\r\nvery   divergent  courses,  which  are  set  to  strain   its\r\n\r\nresources, and create an identity crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public healthcare system was funded on the basis\r\n\r\nthat  basic  healthcare  service was  to  be  affordable  and\r\n\r\naccessible  to all Singaporeans.  There is little doubt  that\r\n\r\nhealthcare service has improved over the years in tandem with\r\n\r\nthe  improvement in the quality and standards  of  living  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This policy is the cornerstone of our healthcare\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been a marked shift in public\r\n\r\nhealthcare policy.  In the 1990s, the Ministry of Health  was\r\n\r\ncontent  with letting its specialists earn private fees  from\r\n\r\npatients  who  were seen within the hospitals.  Recently,  it\r\n\r\nhas  allowed some of its specialists to do part-time  private\r\n\r\npractice  in the private sector, through its Faculty Practice\r\n\r\nPlan.   It has also set up night clinics to compete with  the\r\n\r\nover-crowded  and highly-competitive family practice  clinics\r\n\r\nin the heartlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the public hospitals have set up private clinics\r\n\r\nin  private  hospitals, such as Mount Elizabeth Hospital  and\r\n\r\nGleneagles Hospital.  The public hospitals are now looking to\r\n\r\nprovide  services for new private hospitals, who lack certain\r\n\r\nspecialist  services.   These policy shifts  have  tremendous\r\n\r\nimplications  for the future of the public healthcare  system\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   The  use of public sector  resources  to  do\r\n\r\nprivate  practice  beyond its traditional confines  has  far-reaching consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it will strain the existing resources. With the\r\n\r\nconsultants  spending more and more time in  serving  private\r\n\r\npatients,  how  much time will subsidised patients  get  from\r\n\r\nconsultants?  How much time will there be for consultants  to\r\n\r\ntrain  and  teach  the  Registrars and  the  junior  doctors?\r\n\r\nAlready,  some of the consultants tell me that they  have  no\r\n\r\ntime  to  see  new  subsidised  patients  in  their  clinics.\r\n\r\nRegistrars in the public hospitals have told me that they did\r\n\r\nnot  have any structured training programmes, and these  will\r\n\r\nbe the consultants of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is also non-optimal utilisation of\r\n\r\nexisting  resources.  In the specialist private  sector,  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector is competing where there is an over- provision\r\n\r\nof  hospital  beds.  With the public sector being  unable  to\r\n\r\nfill  its own private beds, and occupancy of the private beds\r\n\r\nin  the public sector ranging from about 50-70%, it does  not\r\n\r\nmake  sense  that  the  public sector consultants  should  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to use services in private hospitals, resulting in\r\n\r\nfurther under-utilisation of public sector resources.  In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe general practice sector, where there is an over-provision\r\n\r\nof  services,  the  operation of  night  polyclinics  further\r\n\r\nexacerbates  the  over-provision  of  services.   The   night\r\n\r\nclinics  will  also  require  more  doctors,  and  this  will\r\n\r\nexacerbate  the shortage of medical officers  in  the  public\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, this is a contradiction of Government policy.\r\n\r\nThe  move  to  allow  public sector doctors  to  practise  in\r\n\r\nprivate  hospitals  in public sector funded  private  clinics\r\n\r\ncreates  an anomaly which has gone against the grain of  what\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  preached.  On the one hand,  the  Government\r\n\r\nencourages  Singaporeans  to become  entrepreneurs  and  take\r\n\r\nrisk,  and  yet  in the healthcare sector, it is  willing  to\r\n\r\nprovide  an umbrella for the public sector doctors,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey will not have to brave the rain and the sunshine, or  to\r\n\r\nbe  subjected  to  the  financial risk of  a  private  sector\r\n\r\npractice.   If  we  want  to extend this  even  further,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  might as well run private hospitals  for  private\r\n\r\npatients  and justify this by saying that it will  help  them\r\n\r\nretain their consultants in the public sector.  If Government\r\n\r\nis serious about growing healthcare as an economic driver, it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  make sense to use public sector resources  to  eat\r\n\r\ninto the same private sector pie in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing healthcare, as an economic driver, goes beyond\r\n\r\nattracting foreign patients to come to Singapore.  Healthcare\r\n\r\nservices  in  Singapore have to expand beyond its  shores  to\r\n\r\nwhere  the  patients are, by expanding services  to  overseas\r\n\r\nfacilities.   It will expand our patient pool  and  give  our\r\n\r\ndoctors increased experience through a greater caseload.   If\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's aim is to retain specialists  in  the  public\r\n\r\nsector,  I  fear that the moves it has taken will cause  more\r\n\r\nharm  than good for the public healthcare sector in the years\r\n\r\nto  come.  An unintended effect of this is the demoralisation\r\n\r\nof  other specialists who are unable to participate in  these\r\n\r\nschemes.   In  the  end, the Ministry may have  retained  the\r\n\r\nspecialists it wants, but the policies adopted will result in\r\n\r\nthe  loss of innocence, a diminution of their passion for the\r\n\r\nsubsidised patients and skew their value systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, we have heard the\r\n\r\nexpression \"It is cheaper to die than to fall ill.\"  That, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is  an exaggeration.

Sir, I think the Ministry should take this\r\n\r\nseriously and find ways on how to assure our people that,  in\r\n\r\nfact, there are enough healthcare schemes to cover them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a case of a person who came to see me at the\r\n\r\nMPS,  and told me a sad story.  Her father fell ill, and  she\r\n\r\nthought  that  she  would  just  send  him  to  hospital  for\r\n\r\nobservation,  maybe for 2-3 days.  Thinking that  the  father\r\n\r\nhad done so much for the family and made a lot of sacrifices,\r\n\r\nshe  admitted the father to a First Class Ward.   And  before\r\n\r\nshe  knew  it, the father's condition got worse, and  he  was\r\n\r\nsent to the ICU.  The case got protracted, and the family was\r\n\r\nshocked  to receive a bill of $70,000.  In fact, she came  to\r\n\r\nsee  me  and tried to get some help.  She said that they  may\r\n\r\nhave to sell their flat to settle the bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there is a serious problem of people who\r\n\r\nactually  do  not know the full picture, or the ramifications\r\n\r\nof  the  cost  of  medical care.  I think hospitals  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   must  try  to  make  sure  that  they   know   the\r\n\r\nconsequences of such a decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case I know of is quite a well-to-do couple.\r\n\r\nTheir  home had been paid for but, unfortunately, they had  a\r\n\r\nchild  with a heart problem and had to go for surgery.   They\r\n\r\nappealed  for  use  of their CPF, because  Medisave  was  not\r\n\r\nsufficient to meet the bills.  We applied to the CPF, and  as\r\n\r\nexpected, CPF said no because of the policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one calls for more information, and the\r\n\r\nother calls for flexibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point I would like to raise, is about\r\n\r\nhealthcare for the elderly - the senior citizens.  I know  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  primary healthcare programme, which  is  growing  in\r\n\r\nterms  of its reach.  But I would like the Minister to  share\r\n\r\nwith us on the progress of this scheme, how pervasive it  is,\r\n\r\nand whether there are ways we could improve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  to  reach  out to more people.

Could the scheme be extended  to  people\r\n\r\nfrom  age  60  onwards, instead of 65?   Could  this  primary\r\n\r\nhealthcare   scheme  be  also  extended  to   cover   chronic\r\n\r\nillnesses, and not just simple illnesses like cough and flu?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, it is a known fact that there has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  shortage of junior doctors in the public sector  for\r\n\r\nmany  years.   The  Ministry of Health's projected  need  for\r\n\r\ndoctors  had  been  skewed.  There should  be  more  accurate\r\n\r\nprojections, and the projections must be reviewed at  regular\r\n\r\nintervals  to take into consideration any changing needs  and\r\n\r\ntrends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an urgent problem that we need to solve, but we\r\n\r\nshould  not  take  any  short cut.  To me,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth's  reflex response to recruit junior doctors from  our\r\n\r\nimmediate  neighbours is not acceptable.  Sir, these  doctors\r\n\r\nare  graduates  from universities which we  never  recognised\r\n\r\nbefore.  Singapore has been known, or at least we want it  to\r\n\r\nbe  known,  as a medical centre of excellence, and  this  has\r\n\r\nbeen  built upon the years of excellent training of  our  own\r\n\r\ndoctors from the best centres.  This prestigious status is in\r\n\r\ndanger of being tainted by recruiting junior doctors from our\r\n\r\nimmediate neighbours to work here.  I worry.  If there should\r\n\r\nbe  any  mishap  caused by these doctors, the confidence  our\r\n\r\npatients  from  the region have when they seek  treatment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  would slowly but surely erode.

However, there  are  some\r\n\r\nconcerns which I would like to ask the Minister for Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Would the Minister evaluate whether we do have\r\n\r\nsufficient  doctors  and  specialists  in  Government  sector\r\n\r\nhealthcare?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  Are we doing enough to attract, and to encourage\r\n\r\ndoctors' training and research, to spearhead Singapore's\r\n\r\ndrive towards the attainment of a bio-medical centre?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)  Whether the shortage of specialists is a factor in the\r\n\r\nlong waiting time for patients in SGH specialist clinics and\r\n\r\nNational Cancer Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a truly world-class medical hub should be a\r\n\r\nresponsible one that cares not just its mega-bio projects and\r\n\r\nmedical  technology, but also one that cares for the patients\r\n\r\nand  doctors  who  are the backdrop of the entire  healthcare\r\n\r\nsystem.

Many  foreign nurses do not have  the  sense  of\r\n\r\npermanence in Singapore and, in fact, may just use  Singapore\r\n\r\nas   a   stepping   stone  to  go  elsewhere.    Furthermore,\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  many  foreign  nurses  can  pose   attendant\r\n\r\nproblems because of language barrier, differences in  nursing\r\n\r\nattitudes as well as other social problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, we have only the Diploma Course from\r\n\r\nNanyang  Polytechnic and the Certificate  in  Nursing  Course\r\n\r\nfrom  ITE.  We do not have an undergraduate nursing programme\r\n\r\nfor  nurses.   Sir, it is about time this latter  option  was\r\n\r\nmade available for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There is a fast-changing technological advancement\r\n\r\nin  science  and  healthcare that requires nurses  to  master\r\n\r\ncomplex  information.   We  need to train  more  professional\r\n\r\nnurses not merely as nursing care deliverers but also as care\r\n\r\nmanagers,  coordinators and innovators to keep  up  with  the\r\n\r\nchanging needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The provision of an undergraduate programme for\r\n\r\nnursing  will  also address the shortage of nurses,  as  this\r\n\r\nwill  provide  another channel for the students  with  better\r\n\r\nexamination  results, who would not do nursing, by  going  to\r\n\r\nITE or Nanyang Polytechnic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The undergraduate programme will enhance the image\r\n\r\nof  nursing and address the presently \"no glamour\" perception\r\n\r\nof many.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) An undergraduate course will allow the discipline\r\n\r\nto  grow, as nurses can then upgrade themselves after  having\r\n\r\ngraduated in the Diploma and Certificate Courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Having \"higher trained\" nurses will fulfill the\r\n\r\npublic's  expectations of getting better and quality  nursing\r\n\r\ncare,  much  in line with their demands for better healthcare\r\n\r\non the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) As we need to expand the delivery of home care and\r\n\r\nstep-down care, we do not just need more nurses but  we  also\r\n\r\nneed  better  qualified  nurses that can  independently  look\r\n\r\nafter  patients  in  their own homes  without  the  hospital-setting supports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Degree-holding nurses may reduce healthcare costs\r\n\r\nbecause they will have the extra training that allows them to\r\n\r\nperform some of the duties that can otherwise be done only by\r\n\r\ndoctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) We definitely need higher trained nurses to perform\r\n\r\nmore  diverse duties, as required in scientific and  clinical\r\n\r\nprojects, to be part of a team with doctors and scientists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, there is a nursing\r\n\r\nshortage  in  our  hospitals, and  this  is  acknowledged  by\r\n\r\neverybody.   Everyone  knows that nurses  play  an  extremely\r\n\r\nimportant  role  in  our medical healthcare  services,  being\r\n\r\npartners  with  the doctors and carrying out doctors'  orders\r\n\r\nand  working  with  the  doctors to  perform  procedures  and\r\n\r\nsurgeries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the two main sources of nurses are through\r\n\r\nthe  educational  institutions, like Nanyang Polytechnic  and\r\n\r\nITE,   or  direct  recruitment  by  the  hospitals.

To make sure\r\n\r\nthat  healthcare is affordable in Singapore, the first  thing\r\n\r\nwe  must try to do is to keep the overall National Healthcare\r\n\r\nExpenditure  (NHE)  down.   Today,  our  National  Healthcare\r\n\r\nExpenditure  is  about 3% of our GDP.   It  is  low  when  we\r\n\r\ncompare  it  with other OECD countries.  They spend,  on  the\r\n\r\naverage,  between 8-10% of their GDP.  In the US,  healthcare\r\n\r\nexpenditure is creeping up to 14% of GDP.  For us, 3% of  GDP\r\n\r\nis very low, compared to the 8% or 10% of the OECD countries.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as a country, it is very affordable.   So  we  are\r\n\r\nalready ahead in the game.  As long as we keep our NHE  down,\r\n\r\nwe are ahead of the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is, having kept the NHE down, who\r\n\r\nshould pay for it, especially with healthcare cost increasing\r\n\r\nevery year?  Should it be the individuals?  Should it be  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?  Should it be the employers?  Or should it be the\r\n\r\ninsurance companies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In very round numbers, about one-third of our NHE is\r\n\r\nborne  by the Government, one-third by the employers  through\r\n\r\nthe  employer-provided medical benefit schemes, and one-third\r\n\r\nby the individual through his Medisave and through his out-of-pocket cash payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question many Members have asked is: is the\r\n\r\nindividual's share at one-third of the healthcare affordable?\r\n\r\nOur  response is that if every Singaporean saves  diligently,\r\n\r\nthrough his Medisave and if he is covered by MediShield, then\r\n\r\nhe  is  able  to  afford B2 charges.  That  is  how  we  have\r\n\r\ncalculated  the  level  of savings for  Medisave.   The  cash\r\n\r\ncomponent is also affordable to the majority of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nIf   we  look  at  the  Household  Expenditure  Survey,  each\r\n\r\nhousehold  spends,  on  the average, 3.3%  of  its  household\r\n\r\nexpenditure, or about $120 per month, on healthcare.  I  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  last time I compared healthcare cost with  hairdo,\r\n\r\nsome  segment of the population took offence.  I promised  my\r\n\r\nwife that I will not compare healthcare with hairdo anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just compare healthcare cost to other forms of\r\n\r\nhousehold  expenditure.  $120 per month, which  is  the  same\r\n\r\nexpenditure  as  a  household spends on telephone  or  mobile\r\n\r\nphone,  SMS,  fax and Internet.  So, is that affordable?   In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  average  household  spends  more  on  his  annual\r\n\r\nvacation.   The average household spends $162  per  month  on\r\n\r\nvacations,  which is 26% more than healthcare.  I  would  say\r\n\r\nthat, on the average, we have kept healthcare cost down,  and\r\n\r\nit  is  affordable.   The  cash component  is  affordable  by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, by and large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the low income household Singaporeans, I have\r\n\r\ntold  Members  before that if they have any MPS  cases  about\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  having  difficulty  in  paying  their  hospital\r\n\r\nbills,  send  the case to the Medical Social  Worker  of  the\r\n\r\nhospital  concerned.   We  have a  team  of  very  competent,\r\n\r\neffective Medical Social Workers in the hospitals,  and  they\r\n\r\nwill  deal with the case.  I have made this offer to  Members\r\n\r\nbefore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nie,  if they have any cases that have been rejected and  they\r\n\r\nstill  feel  that  the cases have merits,  send  the  appeals\r\n\r\neither  to MOS or myself.  I am happy to report that  in  the\r\n\r\nlast three years, both MOS and I have received very few cases\r\n\r\nof  such appeals.  So it shows that our system works and that\r\n\r\nlow  income families, who face financial difficulties in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals,  are adequately dealt with.  In fact, 97%  of  the\r\n\r\napplications  for  Medifund  assistance  are  approved.   Our\r\n\r\nsafety nets do work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.40 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But going forward, when our population gets more aged - today, it is 7% of our population above 65, in 20-30 years,\r\n\r\nthis  will more than double to 16-17% of the population -  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  strengthen our healthcare financing system to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  aging population.  When the population  gets  more\r\n\r\naged,  we will find that the component borne by the employers\r\n\r\nwill  come  down, because the working population  will  be  a\r\n\r\nsmaller  proportion.   And, therefore, the  employer's  share\r\n\r\nwill  reduce.  The Government's share will have to  increase,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have to look after a greater proportion  of  the\r\n\r\naged  population.  The MediShield and the Medisave will  have\r\n\r\nto take on a heavier burden because the individual has to pay\r\n\r\nfor his healthcare expenses as he grows older.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, there are three main things we have to\r\n\r\ndo.   First,  for  the employers, I support the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower  and NTUC's move to make employers' medical benefits\r\n\r\nmore portable, so that even when an employee changes jobs, he\r\n\r\nis  covered.  Better still, make employers' medical  benefits\r\n\r\nportable beyond retirement, so that it covers post-retirement\r\n\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, for the Government, we would bear our fair share\r\n\r\nof  the healthcare cost.  But if we want to keep to our share\r\n\r\nat between a third to half, then Members must realise that we\r\n\r\ncannot subsidise the entire spectrum of the population.  We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  target  our subsidies to the most deserving,  and  that\r\n\r\nmeans,  at  some  point in time, we would have  to  introduce\r\n\r\nmeans  testing, so that whatever subsidies the Government  is\r\n\r\nprepared to fork out, those subsidies are targeted at the low\r\n\r\nincome, at the most deserving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third prong is, as many Members have raised, how to\r\n\r\nreinforce the financing system through allowing better use of\r\n\r\nthe  Medisave, through expanding the scope of MediShield  and\r\n\r\nwhen  we introduce ElderShield, to make sure that ElderShield\r\n\r\nworks.  Sir, I will cover these points in turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on means testing. Both Mdm Halimah and Dr Ong\r\n\r\nSeh  Hong raised this.  The idea of means testing is not new.\r\n\r\nThis  was mooted way back in the 1993 White Paper.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmechanism that will allow us to target subsidies at the lower\r\n\r\nincome group.  As Dr Ong himself has said, philosophically, I\r\n\r\nthink most of us would not disagree that Government subsidies\r\n\r\nshould be targeted and given to Singaporeans who are the most\r\n\r\ndeserving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have some form of self-selection.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are better off would opt for B1 or  A  class\r\n\r\nand  therefore  do  not avail themselves  of  the  subsidies.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are  better  off  would  not  go  to   the\r\n\r\npolyclinics and therefore do not compete for the subsidies in\r\n\r\nour polyclinics.  As long as this self-selection takes place,\r\n\r\nthen  I think we can postpone the date of means testing.   As\r\n\r\nlong  as  the demand is within what our subsidised healthcare\r\n\r\nsystem  can  supply  and  there are no serious  accessibility\r\n\r\nproblems,  such as long queues and waiting times, then  there\r\n\r\nis  no  need to implement means testing in our hospitals  and\r\n\r\nour polyclinics.  But if the subsidies keep expanding and  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  target, then I am afraid, at some  point  in  time,\r\n\r\nmeans  testing  would  have  to  be  introduced.   So  it  is\r\n\r\ninevitable that, at some point in the future, we may have  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  means testing.  So how do we gradually  ease  this\r\n\r\nin?    One  approach  is  that  whenever  we  introduce   new\r\n\r\nprogrammes in our polyclinics and in our hospitals, and if it\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappropriate,  then  we  introduce means testing  selectively.\r\n\r\nFor  example, when we introduce the Primary Care  Partnership\r\n\r\nScheme  where  we  allow  our senior citizens  to  see  their\r\n\r\nprivate  GP  clinics  and  still  claim  subsidies  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  then  I  think  that  should  be  means  tested.\r\n\r\nWhenever  we  introduce new programmes and it is appropriate,\r\n\r\nthen we will incorporate means testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong raised a point about means testing in the step-down sector, particularly in the community hospitals. Let me\r\n\r\nreassure  him that we will phase in the target subsidy  rates\r\n\r\ngradually  and  we will work with the community  hospital  to\r\n\r\nmoderate  the  impact on the patients' bills.  We  will  also\r\n\r\ngive  the community hospitals additional funding so that they\r\n\r\nwould   not   need  to  increase  their  fees   and   charges\r\n\r\nsubstantially.   We  will  work  with  the  other   community\r\n\r\nhospitals  and other step-down care operators to  ease  means\r\n\r\ntesting  in.  But this is a transition.  In the end, we  have\r\n\r\nto decide on the fundamentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked whether we should just subsidise the\r\n\r\nlower half, or should we also subsidise the upper half of the\r\n\r\npopulation,  in terms of income.  If today, we  are  spending\r\n\r\none-third of the overall national health expenditure, then it\r\n\r\nis inevitable that our subsidy is targeted at the lower half.\r\n\r\nOnce  we  start subsidising beyond the median into the  upper\r\n\r\nhalf,  then  Government's share of expenditure must  increase\r\n\r\nsubstantially,  beyond one-third to more than  half  to  two-thirds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the budget for health is $1.6 billion, 1% of the\r\n\r\nGDP,  and  that constitutes one-third of the national  health\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  If we expand it to half, or two-thirds  of  the\r\n\r\nnational  health  expenditure,  then  we  are  talking  about\r\n\r\nincreasing the budget to 2% of the GDP.  Every percent of the\r\n\r\nGDP,  as Members now realise, is equivalent to nearly  2%  of\r\n\r\nGST.   So  we  cannot say do not raise GST, but increase  the\r\n\r\nhealthcare   expenditure.   Some  where,   the  budget   must\r\n\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the budget that we have, there are still quite a\r\n\r\nnumber of things that we can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  to improve the healthcare financing system.  Let me  just\r\n\r\nname  some  of these.  First, is universal coverage.   A  few\r\n\r\nMembers  raised this, especially Mr Gan Kim Yong and  Mr  Yeo\r\n\r\nGuat  Kwang.  We have decided that our healthcare system lays\r\n\r\nemphasis  on personal responsibility.  It is not the national\r\n\r\nhealth  system in the UK and it is not the private  insurance\r\n\r\nsystem  of  the  US.  But our system puts a  great  store  on\r\n\r\npersonal  responsibility, and that  is  the  reason  why  our\r\n\r\nschemes insist on opt-out.  By and large, a person is in, but\r\n\r\nwe  give  him  a  choice to opt-out.   So  he  is  personally\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  that  decision.   It  is  not  a  mandatory\r\n\r\nnational   social  insurance  scheme.   We  try  to   achieve\r\n\r\nuniversal coverage through an opt-out scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But an opt-out scheme means that some segments of our\r\n\r\npopulation  may  not  be  covered, for  example,  MediShield.\r\n\r\nMediShield today applies only primarily to Singaporeans  with\r\n\r\nCPF  accounts.   As  a  result, about  74%  of  our  resident\r\n\r\npopulation is covered by MediShield and 26% are not  covered.\r\n\r\nThis is largely the non-working spouses and children, who are\r\n\r\nnot  covered.   If  we  look at the working  population,  our\r\n\r\ncoverage rate is not too bad, at 90%.  But there is  still  a\r\n\r\nsmall segment who are not covered - some of the self-employed\r\n\r\nand low income people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how do we increase the coverage? Mr Yeo Guat Kwang\r\n\r\npointed  out that we need to watch out for this group  -  the\r\n\r\nself-employed, the low income, the non-working  population  - as  they  are  outside the CPF network.   I  agree  with  him\r\n\r\nbecause  if they are not covered by MediShield and  they  are\r\n\r\nstruck  by  catastrophic  illnesses,  then  they  will   have\r\n\r\nproblems paying for their share of the healthcare costs.  So,\r\n\r\nin  this regard, my Ministry will extend the opt-out, or  the\r\n\r\nauto-coverage mechanism, to non-working spouses, so that they\r\n\r\nwill  have the opportunity to join the MediShield.   We  will\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  new  MediShield opt-out point  for  non-working\r\n\r\nspouses when couples register for their marriage.  This  will\r\n\r\ntake  effect  in 2003.  The thinking is that  when  a  couple\r\n\r\nregisters for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarriage and if one of the couple is a non-working spouse and\r\n\r\nis not covered, then we will send a little polite note to the\r\n\r\ncouple  and say, \"Congratulations!  One of the spouse is  not\r\n\r\ncovered, you are now automatically in, unless you sign an opt-out  form.\"  And we hope that the spouse who is covered  will\r\n\r\nnot  sign the opt-out form for the non-working spouse.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think it will happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my more enthusiastic staff say, \"What about\r\n\r\nchildren?  Why do we not send similar letters every  time  we\r\n\r\nget  the  registration in the birth certificate?\"  I told  my\r\n\r\nstaff,  \"Let us take this one step at a time.  If we do  this\r\n\r\ntoo  much,  then we will be accused of being too  intrusive.\"\r\n\r\nIn  any  case, when the children grow up, when they work  and\r\n\r\nget  their  CPF account, they will be covered by  MediShield.\r\n\r\nSo  I think we have some time.  Meanwhile, we will mount more\r\n\r\npublic  education programmes to get people to sign  on  their\r\n\r\nentire family under MediShield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing we can do is, of course, to extend the\r\n\r\nuse of Medisave and MediShield.  We will gradually do so, but\r\n\r\nI  would  urge that we do so cautiously.  The first thing  we\r\n\r\ncan do is to allow Medisave for ambulatory care.  Because  of\r\n\r\nthe rapid advances in medical technology, some of the medical\r\n\r\ntreatments,  which  are traditionally done  in  an  inpatient\r\n\r\nsetting,  can  now  be  done in an outpatient  setting.   But\r\n\r\nbecause   Medisave  and  MediShield  currently   only   cover\r\n\r\nprimarily    hospitalisation   expenses,   we   inadvertently\r\n\r\ndiscourage the right setting of care.  In other words,  there\r\n\r\nis  little  incentive for the patients and the  providers  to\r\n\r\nseek  or provide treatments at the outpatient settings  since\r\n\r\nthey are unable to access Medisave and MediShield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided to extend the use of Medisave\r\n\r\nand MediShield to several outpatient treatments, which are in\r\n\r\nlieu of inpatient treatments.  This will reduce the need  for\r\n\r\ninpatient  hospitalisation and will save costs.  The  changes\r\n\r\nfor Medisave extension will take effect in October 2002.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry will put out a press release on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, to facilitate patients who need to use step-down care facilities, MOH will also revise the Medisave\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  limits for step-down care on 1st July  2002.   We\r\n\r\nwill raise the Medisave annual withdrawal limit for community\r\n\r\nhospitals  from  $3,000 to $3,500, and the  daily  withdrawal\r\n\r\nlimit for hospices from $125 to $160.  Singaporeans who  need\r\n\r\ncommunity hospital, or hospice care, would therefore be  able\r\n\r\nto use more Medisave and, in turn, less out-of-pocket cash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, I would like to caution Members that these\r\n\r\nchanges should not and do not signal that we are liberalising\r\n\r\nMedisave and MediShield for general outpatient care.  We must\r\n\r\nproceed  cautiously because an overly liberal use of Medisave\r\n\r\nwould  necessitate  higher Medisave contribution  rates.   We\r\n\r\ntherefore need to strike a balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is to reset the Medisave withdrawal\r\n\r\nlimits  and  the  MediShield claimable limits  based  on  the\r\n\r\nDiagnosis  Related Group (DRG).  Today, the limits are  based\r\n\r\non  the  number  of days a patient is hospitalised,  the  so-called  \"per-diem\" basis, and the complexity of the  surgical\r\n\r\nprocedures, a set of tables.  They may not truly reflect  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of  resources  needed to treat the  different  medical\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are therefore revising the Medisave withdrawal limits\r\n\r\nand  the  MediShield claimable limits for inpatient care  and\r\n\r\nday  surgery  based on the Diagnosis Related Group,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will be better commensurate with the medical conditions\r\n\r\nof  the  patients.  The intention is to enable patients  with\r\n\r\nmore severe medical conditions to withdraw more Medisave  and\r\n\r\nclaim more from MediShield to pay for their medical bills  as\r\n\r\ncompared to today.  These changes are scheduled for the first\r\n\r\nquarter of 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth area is really to expand MediShield so that\r\n\r\nit  can better cater to the needs for old age.  This is  what\r\n\r\nseveral  Members  have advocated, for example,  Mr  Yeo  Guat\r\n\r\nKwang.   We are looking into this.  And there are two  stages\r\n\r\nthat  we  will proceed.  The first is to enhance the features\r\n\r\nof MediShield in the first\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquarter  of 2003.  In that first phase, we will increase  the\r\n\r\nclaimable limits, we will lower the deductibles and  the  co-payment,  and  expand  the coverage to additional  outpatient\r\n\r\ntreatments and neo-natal care, so that MediShield can play  a\r\n\r\nbigger role in our personal healthcare financing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second phase is to expand MediShield to provide\r\n\r\nlifetime  coverage, instead of just stopping its coverage  at\r\n\r\nthe age of 80.  To do so, we will have to introduce some form\r\n\r\nof  pre-funding of MediShield.  We will do so in 2004.  Under\r\n\r\nthis scheme, currently what happens is that Singaporeans  pay\r\n\r\na  higher  premium as they grow older.  So  it  becomes  less\r\n\r\naffordable as one grows older.  With pre-funding, what we can\r\n\r\ndo  is  to get Singaporeans to pre-fund, or collect a  higher\r\n\r\npremium,  when they are younger and then when they reach  65,\r\n\r\nthey  will be covered for the rest of their life.  This is  a\r\n\r\nmajor change and it means quite a major restructuring of  the\r\n\r\nMediShield, and we target to do this in 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong said that we need to raise the premiums\r\n\r\nif  we  want to do such a major change.  Indeed, we have  to.\r\n\r\nToday, MediShield plays a fairly limited role because it is a\r\n\r\ncatastrophic insurance scheme.  We collect about $90  million\r\n\r\nin  premiums  every year.  If we look at the national  health\r\n\r\nexpenditure  (NHE)  of  about $4.2 billion,  $90  million  is\r\n\r\nbetween   1-2%  of  the  national  health  expenditure.    So\r\n\r\nMediShield  is  only playing a piffling role in  our  overall\r\n\r\nstructure.  If we want MediShield to undertake, say,  10%  of\r\n\r\nour  NHE,  something like $400-over million, then we  need  a\r\n\r\nfour-time  increase  in  the  premiums  to  make  it   really\r\n\r\neffective.   So  I am giving Members early warning.   When  I\r\n\r\ncome  next  to  the House with a major restructuring  of  the\r\n\r\nMediShield,  and if we want MediShield to play a  major  role\r\n\r\nand  be  the  foundation  for the portable  medical  benefits\r\n\r\nscheme, then we need a fairly quantum leap in the coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also suggested that we accredit more\r\n\r\ninsurance  schemes  as Medisave-approved  schemes.   To-date,\r\n\r\nbesides MediShield, we have four other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedisave-approved  catastrophic illnesses insurance  schemes,\r\n\r\nnamely,  IncomeShield, HealthShield Plus,  SupremeHealth  and\r\n\r\nMaxHealth,  of  which the last two were just introduced  last\r\n\r\nyear.  Let me just sound this word of caution.  If we have  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of such private schemes and they each take  5-10%  of\r\n\r\nthe  market share, the danger is that the private sector will\r\n\r\nthen  cherry-pick the good risks and leave the bad  risks  to\r\n\r\nMediShield, and that will make MediShield untenable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to review the guidelines governing the use of\r\n\r\nMedisave for approved insurance scheme.  We will consult  the\r\n\r\nindustry   players.  Our intent is to give  private  insurers\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility to offer more products as  long  as  key\r\n\r\nsafeguards,  such  as deductibles and co-payments  remain  to\r\n\r\ndeter the \"buffet syndrome\".  But we must also make sure that\r\n\r\neach  player carries a fair share of the good risks  and  the\r\n\r\nbad risks.  Sir, as I said, we are targeting to do this study\r\n\r\nand  for the major reform of the MediShield, it will take  us\r\n\r\nabout  a  year and we will be in a position to come  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse with the new scheme before 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area is ElderShield. We introduced the concept\r\n\r\nof ElderShield and we got the private sector to tender for it\r\n\r\nand  we  are in the position now to implement it in September\r\n\r\nthis  year.   Dr  Lily  Neo  and Mdm Halimah  raised  several\r\n\r\nquestions about ElderShield.  Let me just go through some  of\r\n\r\nthe  key  principles in the ElderShield.  First,  we  decided\r\n\r\nthat  it  should  be an actuarial insurance,  rather  than  a\r\n\r\nsocial  insurance.  If it is an actuarial insurance, then  it\r\n\r\nmeans  that the pre-existing disabilities cannot be  covered.\r\n\r\nThat is the industry practice.  Second, we have to decide  on\r\n\r\nthe  payout ratio.  The current industry norm is 3 Activities\r\n\r\nof  Daily Living (ADLs).  If we lower it to 1 or 2 ADLs, then\r\n\r\nthe  payout  ratio will be higher.  Today,  at  3  ADLs,  the\r\n\r\npayout  ratio  is  1:12.   So  that  is  the  whole  idea  of\r\n\r\ninsurance.  We collect from 12 persons and we pay out to  one\r\n\r\nperson.  So the premium is low.  If we lower the ADLs to 1 or\r\n\r\n<br><br>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADLs, then the payout ratio will be much higher.  Then we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  to collect from fewer people to pay out to more people,\r\n\r\nin  which case, the premiums will be higher.  As a start,  we\r\n\r\nhave  decided to stick at 3 ADLs, which is the industry norm,\r\n\r\nand that means a payout ratio of about 1:12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next feature is the level of payout. We have\r\n\r\ndecided  on  $300.   Why?  Because if you  are  a  low-income\r\n\r\nperson  and you are disabled and you have to go to a  nursing\r\n\r\nhome,  through  our means testing, you will qualify  for  75%\r\n\r\nsubsidy.  The Government will pay 75% subsidy if you are  the\r\n\r\nbottom  10%.  If you are the bottom 30%, the Government  will\r\n\r\npay  50%  subsidy.   The nursing homes  today  charge  around\r\n\r\n$1,000-$1,200.  So, your share will be about  $250  or  $500.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a $300 payout will go quite a long way to help you\r\n\r\npay for your share of a nursing home.  That is why we decided\r\n\r\non  $300.  We decided on cash rather than claims for service,\r\n\r\nso  that  it gives you flexibility.  As Dr Lily Neo said,  if\r\n\r\nthe patient also has chronic illnesses but stays at home,  he\r\n\r\ncould  use the $300 for outpatient services, for home medical\r\n\r\nor  home nursing.  But in the more severe case when you  have\r\n\r\nto  end  up in a nursing home, then the $300 is a significant\r\n\r\npercentage  of  the co-sharing of your component  of  nursing\r\n\r\nhome fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other feature is the payout period. We decided on\r\n\r\nfive  years or 60-month payout because our survey shows  that\r\n\r\nthe  average  length  of stay for nursing  home  patients  is\r\n\r\nnormally between two and five years.  So a 60-month payout is\r\n\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me just say that we are launching ElderShield\r\n\r\nand  we  want  to  make it as simple as possible  to  get  it\r\n\r\nstarted.   We  have got two private insurers to  provide  the\r\n\r\nservice.   The  intention is that after they  have  run  this\r\n\r\nscheme  for  one or two years, we will encourage the  private\r\n\r\nsector  to  have top-up to this scheme.  So this is  a  basic\r\n\r\nscheme.   In  one  or  two years, when the  private  insurers\r\n\r\nrunning the scheme have more experience, I see no reason  why\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  offer enhancements, eg, higher payouts,  longer\r\n\r\npayout periods\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  different types of coverage.  So this is just the  basic\r\n\r\ncoverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make this scheme work, we need to ease it in. For\r\n\r\nsomebody who is 40 years old today, it is not a problem.  You\r\n\r\npay  the  premiums, at the age of 65 you are covered for  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  your life.  For somebody who is 65 now, to pay  the\r\n\r\npremium to be covered for the rest of your life, the premiums\r\n\r\nwill  be very high.  So we need to find a way to ease it  in.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  way  we  have  done so is to allow  people  to  pay\r\n\r\npremiums over a 10-year period, from 59 years old to 69 years\r\n\r\nold.   So  we  have a cut-off at 70.  Anybody who is  younger\r\n\r\nthan  that  will  have a 10-year payout, and  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill,  in fact, contribute almost a third of the premiums  to\r\n\r\nhelp  make the premiums affordable.  This subsidy will amount\r\n\r\nto $360 million.  So we have persuaded the Government to give\r\n\r\nus  $360 million to help pay almost one-third of the premiums\r\n\r\nof the senior citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, there are two groups - those above 70 and those\r\n\r\nwith  pre-existing disabilities.  They are not covered.   For\r\n\r\nthese,  we  have  the  IDAPE scheme in which  the  Government\r\n\r\nreally  becomes  the insurer.  If they are above  70  or  are\r\n\r\nalready disabled, the Government will, in fact, pay them $100\r\n\r\nor $150 for up to 60 months.  So the Government undertakes to\r\n\r\nbe  the insurer, because it is not fair to load them onto the\r\n\r\nactuarial system.  If we load them onto ElderShield, then the\r\n\r\nrest  of Singaporeans will pay.  For this group, in fact  the\r\n\r\nGovernment becomes the insurer, but they will receive half of\r\n\r\nwhat  they will get from ElderShield.  To run this transition\r\n\r\nscheme  will  cost  the  Government $300  million.   Just  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  ElderShield, we have to go to the  Government  and\r\n\r\nseek  a  total of $660 million to ease the scheme in.   After\r\n\r\nthis  transition, when the scheme is on a sure footing,  then\r\n\r\nit will be on its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked why we have not promoted the\r\n\r\nscheme  more rigorously.  For pragmatic reasons, if  I  do  a\r\n\r\nmajor  promotion  last  year, most  Singaporeans  would  have\r\n\r\nforgotten  by  now.  So we target to go out and promote  this\r\n\r\nscheme more aggressively between\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune and September when the scheme will be launched.  We  are\r\n\r\nenlisting  the  help of all the Mayors to help  us  work  the\r\n\r\nground and launch the scheme from June to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, for the low-income group, Medifund is a very\r\n\r\nimportant  safety net.  As Mr Gan Kim Yong said, it  is  very\r\n\r\neffective.   97%  of  Medifund applicants are  successful  in\r\n\r\ntheir  applications.   We  continue to  review  the  Medifund\r\n\r\neligibility criteria regularly.  Each hospital has a Medifund\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  it  has the flexibility to deviate  from  the\r\n\r\nMedifund   criteria   and  approve  deserving   cases   under\r\n\r\nexceptional  circumstances.  That is the reason why  we  have\r\n\r\nsuch  a  high  approval rate.  But it  is  still  within  the\r\n\r\ninterest income that we are earning from the capital  sum  of\r\n\r\n$800 million in the Medifund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On public education, I agree with both Mr Yeo Guat Kwang\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Zainul  Abidin  that we have  to  do  more  and  get\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  particularly  our  elderly  Singaporeans,   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  system and to navigate the  system.   A  key\r\n\r\ncomponent of this is counselling at the point of service,  in\r\n\r\nthe hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr Zainul Abidin raised the example of one of his\r\n\r\nMPS  cases, where one of his constituents decided to send the\r\n\r\nparent  to an A-class ward despite our financial counselling,\r\n\r\nthen  there is very little we can do to help.  If I may  just\r\n\r\nreinforce  this point.  As I have said here before,  we  have\r\n\r\nuniversal accessibility to our healthcare system.  As long as\r\n\r\na  patient chooses B2 and C-class wards - I used to give  the\r\n\r\nexample, unlike lawyers, when Mr Chiam raised this question - we  do not collect deposits when a patient chooses a B2 or C-class ward.  So when Dr Michael Lim raised the example of  KK\r\n\r\nHospital wanting a deposit of $20,000 or $60,000, this refers\r\n\r\nto  private patients.  Our rules are straightforward.  If you\r\n\r\nare  a  subsidised B2 or C-class patient, you are  guaranteed\r\n\r\naccess  to  our healthcare system.  There is no deposit.   We\r\n\r\ntreat  you first and settle the bill later on.  We have  done\r\n\r\nso  in  all cases.  We use Medifund for the deserving  cases.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchoose  to  come in for B1 and A-class, that means  you  have\r\n\r\nself-selected,  you have decided for yourself  that  you  are\r\n\r\nabove  the  median and you can pay for the healthcare  costs.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we will treat you just like in a private hospital.\r\n\r\nWe will evaluate what kind of condition you are coming in for\r\n\r\nand we will ask you for the relevant and appropriate deposit.\r\n\r\nI think that is fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you go to a private hospital, you have also decided\r\n\r\nfor  yourself that you do not need subsidies and you can  pay\r\n\r\nfor  your medical bills.  We are very happy that you are able\r\n\r\nto  go and can afford private healthcare.  But, when you want\r\n\r\nto  switch  from a private hospital to a public hospital,  we\r\n\r\nwill deem you as a private patient and, therefore, we require\r\n\r\nyou to put up a deposit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The example that Dr Michael Lim raised is a neo-natal\r\n\r\ncase.   We  face  several  of such cases  every  year.   They\r\n\r\ndeliver  the babies, the babies are premature, complications,\r\n\r\nso  the bills mount.  One way is to tell the private hospital\r\n\r\nthat  since they have accepted the patient, it is their moral\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  look after the  patient.   If  they  have\r\n\r\naccepted the patient, if there are complications, they  carry\r\n\r\non  looking after the patient and, if there is a bad debt, it\r\n\r\nis  part  of  their operating costs.  We should  not  have  a\r\n\r\nsituation  where the private hospitals encounter  such  cases\r\n\r\nand   then  encourage  the  patients  to  go  to  the  public\r\n\r\nhospitals.  Then the public hospitals become the hospital  of\r\n\r\nlast  resort.   The  other approach is to  cover  this  under\r\n\r\nMediShield,  and this is what we intend to do.   So  when  we\r\n\r\nmake the changes next year, we will allow MediShield to cover\r\n\r\nsuch neo-natal cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim also asked about the role of public\r\n\r\nhealthcare  institutions.  Let me assure Dr Michael  Lim  and\r\n\r\nall  Members here that, today, more than 90% of the  beds  in\r\n\r\nthe public-sector hospitals are subsidised beds.  That is our\r\n\r\nprimary  role and remains our primary role.  However,  we  do\r\n\r\nrun a small percentage of beds for A-class patients where  we\r\n\r\ntreat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  as  private  patients, whether  it  is  Singaporean  or\r\n\r\nforeign  patients.   In  NUH, for example,  foreign  patients\r\n\r\naccount for less than 5% of the patient-load.  When we  allow\r\n\r\nthe hospitals to run the Faculty Practice Plan, less than  1%\r\n\r\nof  the specialist manpower in the public sector is involved.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  allow them to do so, the hospitals have  to  do  so\r\n\r\nstrictly  at arm's length, and all their services are  priced\r\n\r\nat  market rates.  So it is proper accounting.  There  is  no\r\n\r\ncross-subsidy.   Hence,  it is not true  that  we  are  using\r\n\r\npublic resources to compete with the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim also queried why the polyclinics have\r\n\r\ngone  into night clinics.  The reason why I have allowed  the\r\n\r\npolyclinics  to go into night clinics is because  I  consider\r\n\r\nthat   as   providing   better  services  for   Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  it also means a little bit  more  competition\r\n\r\nfor the private clinics in the area.  But all of us should be\r\n\r\nable to take competition in our stride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have restructured our public-sector hospitals and\r\n\r\npolyclinics  so that they are more efficient, productive  and\r\n\r\nresponsive.  I think this is one of the areas contributing to\r\n\r\nour  lower  NHE.  If we had continued running our polyclinics\r\n\r\nand  hospitals  like  the old Government departments  without\r\n\r\nsubjecting them to competition and without subjecting them to\r\n\r\nproductivity  pressures and efficiency pressures,  the  costs\r\n\r\nwould   have  been  higher.   The  idea  is  not  for   these\r\n\r\ninstitutions to maximise profits but, really, to bring  costs\r\n\r\ndown  and offer a better service to Singaporeans.  Last year,\r\n\r\nwe  went one step forward to position the public sector, both\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Healthcare Services and the National Healthcare\r\n\r\nGroup,   the  two  clusters,  as  \"Not-for-Profit\"   entities\r\n\r\nexplicitly.     We    designate   them   as    not-for-profit\r\n\r\norganisations  so that our two clusters will  preserve  their\r\n\r\nsense  of  public  service and have a different  organisation\r\n\r\nculture  from the private hospitals.  But that does not  mean\r\n\r\nthat they do not make surpluses.  They must be efficient and,\r\n\r\nwith  the private patients, they must charge what the  market\r\n\r\ncan bear, and they should make surpluses.  They should not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  embarrassed by it.  But, having made the surpluses, these\r\n\r\nare  not-for-profit  organisations, and they  will  then  use\r\n\r\nthese surpluses for research, better services and training of\r\n\r\ntheir staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the doctor situation. Compared to\r\n\r\nDecember  2000, in December 2001, we had a nett  increase  of\r\n\r\n345  doctors,  or 6.2%.  Our doctor to population  ratio  has\r\n\r\nimproved from 1:720 to 1:700 now.  If you ask me, the overall\r\n\r\ndoctor situation is all right.  If we look around, do we have\r\n\r\na  shortage of private-sector GPs?  I think the answer is no.\r\n\r\nMany  of  our  private-sector GPs have  to  compete  and  are\r\n\r\nstruggling.   So there is really no shortage of doctors.   We\r\n\r\ndo  have  a shortage of specialists.  Not enough doctors  are\r\n\r\nbecoming   specialists,  and  we  do  have  a  shortfall   of\r\n\r\nspecialists  in  a few areas, eg, cardiac surgery,  radiology\r\n\r\nand  geriatrics.   But, by and large,  the  total  number  of\r\n\r\ndoctors  is sufficient.  We do have a shortage of doctors  in\r\n\r\nthe  public  sector.  By our norms, we have  a  shortfall  of\r\n\r\nabout  12%.  This means that our doctors in the public sector\r\n\r\nare  heavily worked.  Instead of working eight or nine  hours\r\n\r\nper  day,  they  have to work 10, 11 or 12  hours.   This  is\r\n\r\nobviously not sustainable and we have taken action to try and\r\n\r\nrecruit more and improve the manpower situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a national basis, NUS has increased its intake for\r\n\r\nmedicine  starting in 1996 and, therefore,  we  should  start\r\n\r\nseeing more doctors graduating from this year.  The Singapore\r\n\r\nMedical  Council  has also exercised greater  flexibility  in\r\n\r\napproving temporary registration of foreign-trained  doctors.\r\n\r\nThat  allows  us  to  bring  in a  few  more  foreign-trained\r\n\r\ndoctors.  Dr  Lily Neo is not very happy with  this  and  she\r\n\r\nfeels  that  we are bringing in doctors from neighbouring  or\r\n\r\nimmediate  countries and that would diminish  our  reputation\r\n\r\nand lower the standards of care here.  Let me assure her that\r\n\r\nwhen  SMC  allows these doctors in on temporary registration,\r\n\r\nit  means  that these doctors are strictly supervised.   They\r\n\r\nare  not  allowed  to  practise on their own.  They  practise\r\n\r\nwithin an institutional framework under close\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupervision.   It  is  not  our  intention  to  diminish  the\r\n\r\nreputation of Singapore as a healthcare centre.   But  we  do\r\n\r\nneed them as a way of building up our supply.  Singapore  has\r\n\r\na  very  small  population  and  it  cannot  just  depend  on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to be doctors.  At the steady stage, if  we  can\r\n\r\ntrain  between 230-250 Singaporeans in our university and  we\r\n\r\nsupplement  it  by  an annual recruitment  of  between  50-80\r\n\r\ndoctors  trained overseas, both Singaporeans and  Malaysians,\r\n\r\nas well as other nationalities, I think it will provide for a\r\n\r\nfairly  robust  system.   So we are not  having  a  group  of\r\n\r\ndoctors that are overly represented by foreign doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the medical intake quotas, there are three sound\r\n\r\nreasons  why there is a quota.  First, we still believe  that\r\n\r\nwe need to have a finger on the supply of doctors. Second, we\r\n\r\nhave a limited talent pool.  We cannot have all our brightest\r\n\r\nstudents  going  to  be  doctors.  And  third,  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ntraining doctors is very expensive.  There are still  reasons\r\n\r\nfor us to have a quota.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the one-third quota on female students,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, the data still shows that more female  doctors\r\n\r\nwork part-time than male doctors.  You can either look at  it\r\n\r\nas  a container being half-full or half-empty, but that is  a\r\n\r\nfact of life.  I have said earlier that we are reviewing this\r\n\r\nquota.  In fact, the Economic Review Committee's Services Sub-committee,  chaired  by Mr Khaw Boon  Wan,  is  studying  the\r\n\r\nmedical manpower requirements, including the quota on  female\r\n\r\nmedical  students,  in  the  light  of  the  overall  medical\r\n\r\nservices  review to promote the healthcare services industry.\r\n\r\nI would urge Members to be a little bit more patient and give\r\n\r\nMr Khaw Boon Wan a bit more time to complete his study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On nurses, the situation has also improved a little. We\r\n\r\nhave  a 3.3% increase in nurses compared to 2000.  Our nurses\r\n\r\nto  population ratio is now 1:300.  In the public sector,  we\r\n\r\nhave  vacancies of about 6.6%.  This is a slight  improvement\r\n\r\nfrom  last year's shortfall of 7.5%.  We have taken steps  to\r\n\r\naddress  this shortfall.  First, we have increased the  total\r\n\r\nnursing student intake in Nanyang Polytechnic and the ITE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  more  than 100 places.  We have looked at salary reviews,\r\n\r\nincreased the salaries of nurses by an average of 13% in  the\r\n\r\nyear  2000, and 6% last year.  We have worked out a  clinical\r\n\r\ncareer  path  for  nurses.  Our intention  is  that  we  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  around  25% of our nurses  in  taking  up  degree\r\n\r\ncourses.   Whether  the  degree course  is  done  locally  or\r\n\r\noverseas  is  something we have to work with the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.   But  we have worked out a career  path  and  our\r\n\r\nintention  is  that  25%  of  our  nurses  should  have   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to progress to degree courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim suggests that maybe we can set up\r\n\r\noverseas  training facilities.  We have the  resources  here.\r\n\r\nOur  problem  is  not  training facilities.  Our  problem  is\r\n\r\nattracting  Singaporeans  to take up  nursing  as  a  career.\r\n\r\nThere  is  an article in the Today paper.  It is a three-part\r\n\r\nseries on nursing.  The most striking feature of that article\r\n\r\nis  that some of the students, who take up the courses,  drop\r\n\r\nout when they realise quite early in the course that it is  a\r\n\r\nvery,  very  demanding  career.   If  you  do  not  have  the\r\n\r\ncommitment, then many of them do not make it.  It is  a  very\r\n\r\nchallenging and a very demanding career.  Our job is to  make\r\n\r\nit  attractive  and  make sure that enough  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nattracted  to  nursing to serve Singaporeans.   But  for  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  future, we still need to depend on between  20-25%\r\n\r\nforeigners to fill up the nursing positions in our hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I believe I have covered most of the items.\r\n\r\nLet  me  just say that for the point on PCPS, I have answered\r\n\r\nthis  previously in Parliament, so there is  no  need  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  it again.  Mr Low Thia Khiang also raised about  the\r\n\r\nMOs being overworked.  We are reviewing the situation. Today,\r\n\r\nthere  is  some disparity in the hospitals and  also  between\r\n\r\ndepartments in the hospitals, where some MOs, who are  posted\r\n\r\nto  some  departments, because of the shortage of junior  MOs\r\n\r\nthere,  they  end up having more than a fair share  of  their\r\n\r\nnight duties.  We have asked the hospitals to review this and\r\n\r\nrationalise the situation.  We are keeping a close  watch  on\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just end by saying that healthcare cost will\r\n\r\ncontinue to go up.  I cannot stand here and tell you that  we\r\n\r\ncan control healthcare cost to the extent that it will not go\r\n\r\nup.  As Dr Ong Seh Hong summarised, there are so many reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  healthcare  cost goes up, many of these are  beyond  our\r\n\r\ncontrol.  The more sensible approach is to recognise that  if\r\n\r\nyou  want  a  level  of  healthcare  equivalent  to  what  is\r\n\r\navailable in the developed countries, then we must accept the\r\n\r\nfact  that  healthcare cost will go up.  It  will  go  up  by\r\n\r\nbetween  4%, 6% or even 8% every year.  So far, we have  been\r\n\r\nvery  fortunate because our economy also grows by 6%, 8%  and\r\n\r\neven 10% in the first seven years in the 1990s.  Our national\r\n\r\nhealthcare expenditure is able to maintain at 3% of GDP.   If\r\n\r\nwe  undertake all the changes put up by DPM Lee  in  his  tax\r\n\r\nreview and we generate the 4-6% growth, that will be the best\r\n\r\nbet  for  us to keep up with healthcare costs.  If healthcare\r\n\r\ncost goes up 6-8%, our economy grows by 4-6%, we maintain our\r\n\r\nnational  health expenditure at around 3-4% of GDP, and  that\r\n\r\nis the best solution for affordability of healthcare.  If you\r\n\r\ndo  not generate the growth, healthcare cost will still go up\r\n\r\nbecause  Singaporeans will still want good healthcare.  Then,\r\n\r\nwe  will  be  in a fix, trying to find the money to  pay  for\r\n\r\nhealthcare cost.  Having maintained the growth and we contain\r\n\r\nhealthcare cost to between 6-8%, then we are still  ahead  in\r\n\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to do, recognising that healthcare cost\r\n\r\nwill  go  up, is to prepare for the situation in 10-20  years\r\n\r\nfrom  now when a higher percentage of our population is  aged\r\n\r\nand  we  have to spend more on healthcare.  This is what  the\r\n\r\ntax  changes  are  all about.  What we do  in  Health  is  to\r\n\r\nprepare  for  that day.  This means we introduce ElderShield,\r\n\r\nwe  expand MediShield, we build up ElderCare Fund.   In  case\r\n\r\nMembers need to be reminded, we launched ElderCare Fund  less\r\n\r\nthan  two years ago, and because of the budget surpluses that\r\n\r\nwe were able to generate, we are able to set aside $1 billion\r\n\r\nalready  in ElderCare Fund.  We build up all these  endowment\r\n\r\nfunds  during this period where we are enjoying  good  growth\r\n\r\nand these endowment funds will serve us well when we are in a\r\n\r\nperiod\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof lower growth because of a maturing economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Mr Chairman, I would like to\r\n\r\nseek  some  clarifications with the Minister.   The  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  that night polyclinics are a good thing but in the next\r\n\r\nbreath,  he  himself  said  that the  GP  market  is  a  very\r\n\r\ncompetitive  market,  there is an over-supply  and  they  are\r\n\r\nstruggling.   At the same time, he said that  there  are  not\r\n\r\nenough  medical officers in the service.  He  appears  to  be\r\n\r\ncontradicting   himself  because  this  is   an   over-supply\r\n\r\nsituation, and you are not allocating resources properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to seek clarification with the\r\n\r\nMinister   whether  the  $20,000-$60,000  deposit   that   is\r\n\r\nrequired, in the example I quoted, is the norm that they  ask\r\n\r\nof  foreign patients who get admitted to KK Hospital as well.\r\n\r\nBecause  in the private sector, none of the private hospitals\r\n\r\ndo  that.  They accept patients from other countries and they\r\n\r\nnever ask for $20,000 or $60,000.  If they do that, they will\r\n\r\nall shut down!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the example I quoted, where the surgery can\r\n\r\nonly  be done at a public hospital, does it mean that if  the\r\n\r\nfamily  cannot  fork out the expenses and  no  guarantor  was\r\n\r\navailable,   the  public  hospital  will  not   accept   this\r\n\r\nparticular patient and would rather let the patient perish in\r\n\r\nthe private hospital?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, another clarification is that, as the Minister\r\n\r\npointed  out  very  correctly, most of the  patients  in  our\r\n\r\nhospitals  are subsidised, yet our consultants  are  spending\r\n\r\nmore  and more time looking after private patients.  I cannot\r\n\r\nsee how the consultants have so much time as I have told him,\r\n\r\nfrom  the ground, already the consultants are telling me that\r\n\r\nthey do not have time for subsidised patients.  I am not sure\r\n\r\nhow he can balance the limited resources, encouraging private\r\n\r\nsector  practice for the consultants and, at the  same  time,\r\n\r\nmost of his patients are subsidised patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> First, on the primary care sector. In\r\n\r\nthe White Paper, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  is committed to serving 25% of the market.   This\r\n\r\nmeans  the  Government undertakes that in the  primary  care,\r\n\r\nthrough  our polyclinics, we will service the bottom  25%  of\r\n\r\nthe  population.  Today, we are around there.  We think  that\r\n\r\nwith the investment that we have put into our polyclinics, we\r\n\r\nshould   provide  night  services.  This  means,  of  course,\r\n\r\nstretching the doctors further and the CEOs in charge of  the\r\n\r\npolyclinics  have  to go out there and recruit  doctors.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry has given them the mission that they should  service\r\n\r\nthe  bottom 25% of Singaporeans and if that service  includes\r\n\r\nnight clinics, then they must provide the night clinics,  and\r\n\r\nif  they do not have enough doctors, they jolly well  go  out\r\n\r\nthere and recruit the doctors and they have the budget to  do\r\n\r\nso.  So that is not a problem of resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is on the deposit. This is a special\r\n\r\ncase  of a neo-natal admission.  So when KK Hospital receives\r\n\r\nor  evaluates a premature baby, KK Hospital has  to  make  an\r\n\r\nassessment to take over the baby and to look after  the  baby\r\n\r\nfor  the  next  few months, and in fact, in  one  case,  they\r\n\r\nlooked after the baby for the next one year.  It is going  to\r\n\r\ncost  a lot of money, and therefore, the family should pay  a\r\n\r\ndeposit commensurate with the severity of the case. It is not\r\n\r\nto  say  that  all  private patients coming  to  restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals  have to pay a deposit of $20,000 or  $60,000.   It\r\n\r\ndepends on what case he is coming in for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know neo-natal cases are very emotional examples. We\r\n\r\nhad one appeal, probably the same case.  KK Hospital admitted\r\n\r\nthe  baby,  even though they were very reluctant  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nBecause the appeal came to me, we asked KK Hospital to admit.\r\n\r\nI  regret making that decision because, in the end, the  baby\r\n\r\ncontinued to be in intensive care and KK Hospital now runs up\r\n\r\na total bill of more than $300,000.  These are very expensive\r\n\r\ncases.  When a baby is born prematurely, it requires a lot of\r\n\r\nresources  to  keep the baby alive.  I had a long  discussion\r\n\r\nwith  my Minister of State, Dr Balaji, and I said, \"Is  there\r\n\r\nany way you can tell whether there is brain damage?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing a neurosurgeon, he said, \"There is no way you can tell.\r\n\r\nIt  is only after one or two years that you will know whether\r\n\r\nthe  whole  period of premature birth has resulted  in  brain\r\n\r\ndamage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is a very sad situation, but unfortunately we do\r\n\r\nhave  these  types  of cases of neo-natal  babies,  premature\r\n\r\nbabies.  If the family is unfortunate to have such a case,  I\r\n\r\nsympathise  with them.  If they want to keep the baby  alive,\r\n\r\nthe hospitals want to help, but they must find the resources.\r\n\r\nAnd  that  is  the reason why I have decided to include  neo-natal  coverage within MediShield.  It may not  be  the  best\r\n\r\ndecision  because, in the end, somebody has to  pay  for  the\r\n\r\ncost.   What we are doing is then sharing the cost among  all\r\n\r\nof  us,  Singaporeans, and not just on the families that  are\r\n\r\nunfortunate enough to have such a baby.  So anyway, from next\r\n\r\nyear  onwards,  we  hope  to incorporate  neo-natal  coverage\r\n\r\nwithin MediShield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the extension of the specialists in the faculty\r\n\r\npractice, let me again assure Dr Michael Lim that it  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  MOH's  policy to ask our specialists in our restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals  to  set  up clinics in a private  hospital  or  to\r\n\r\nundertake  faculty practice.  We leave that decision  to  the\r\n\r\nCEO   and  to  the  departmental  heads.   The  CEO  and  the\r\n\r\ndepartmental heads, in managing the specialists  under  them,\r\n\r\nmust  make sure that allowing these specialists to look after\r\n\r\nprivate  patients through the faculty practice, that they  do\r\n\r\nnot  compromise  the  level  of  service  to  the  subsidised\r\n\r\npatients.   The  Ministry of Health signs a  3-year  contract\r\n\r\nwith  our  restructured hospitals.  We set down  very  strict\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service standards, etc, etc.   They  have  to\r\n\r\nundertake  to meet these service standards.  If the  CEO  and\r\n\r\nthe  departmental heads allow their specialists to  undertake\r\n\r\nfaculty  practice  and  fail  to  deliver  on  these  service\r\n\r\nstandards to the subsidised patients, then under the  service\r\n\r\ncontract  that we have with them they will pay a  very  heavy\r\n\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek two clarifications\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister?  How\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlong does the Minister expect to ease the problem of shortage\r\n\r\nof  doctors  in  public hospitals?  Secondly,  Sir,  has  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  shortage  and overwork of doctors in  the  hospitals\r\n\r\naffected the medical standard of public sector hospitals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as I mentioned in my response,\r\n\r\nwe  are  currently facing a shortage because  our  population\r\n\r\nexpanded  since  1993, and our medical intake  only  expanded\r\n\r\nsince  1996.   So, for these 6-9 years, we have  a  mismatch.\r\n\r\nBut,  starting  from this year, we will be getting  a  higher\r\n\r\nintake of graduates from our medical school, and we are  also\r\n\r\nbringing in more foreign doctors.  So that would relieve  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  I expect the doctor situation to improve over the\r\n\r\nnext five years.  But that is not a guarantee.  We still have\r\n\r\nto  continuously  adjust our working conditions,  adjust  our\r\n\r\nremuneration  structure,  to  make  sure  that   our   public\r\n\r\nhospitals  are competitive, and that we are able  to  attract\r\n\r\nour fair share of doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service levels are not so adversely affected. As I\r\n\r\nmentioned  last  year,  we engaged  a  group  of  operational\r\n\r\nresearch  consultants to look at the queuing system  and  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  times.   We are now finalising  the  study.   If  we\r\n\r\nintroduce some of the proposals that the consultants put  up,\r\n\r\nI  am  confident that we can improve the level of service  in\r\n\r\nour public hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I seek clarification, Sir? The\r\n\r\nMinister  did  not  reply  to my earlier  question  regarding\r\n\r\nrecognising the graduates from over 150 previously recognised\r\n\r\nforeign universities.  May I also ask the Minister whether it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  better  to  review this  policy  rather  than\r\n\r\nrecruiting junior doctors from neighbouring countries,  whose\r\n\r\nuniversities we had never recognised before?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, even though we do not recognise\r\n\r\nor we stop recognising some of these institutions since 1993,\r\n\r\nthey   are   still   allowed  to  come  in  under   temporary\r\n\r\nregistration.  So we are not forgoing these sources.  Even if\r\n\r\nI  make  a decision, or we get a decision to recognise  these\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  it  would be another 5-6 years  before  people\r\n\r\ndecide that, now that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  recognised, they send their children there  and  then\r\n\r\nthey  come back after graduation.  So what I am talking about\r\n\r\nis  a  temporary  shortage.  We have  increased  the  medical\r\n\r\nintake.   When we start taking the 230-250 doctors  from  our\r\n\r\nlocal  NUS  and we continue to recruit between 50-80  doctors\r\n\r\noverseas, we will have a complement of about 320-350 doctors,\r\n\r\nand  that  is enough for our needs.  So there is no  need  to\r\n\r\nchange  the  rules  of  the game.  The  current  shortage  is\r\n\r\ntemporary,  transitional shortage, and within  2-3  years  we\r\n\r\nshould get over the worse of this shortage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Chairman, may I just disagree with the\r\n\r\nMinister on what he just said?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you please proceed to your next cut?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> The importance of preventive healthcare is\r\n\r\na  foregone  conclusion, and I am glad  about  MOH's  visible\r\n\r\nincreased effort in this area presently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to specially mention the success of the\r\n\r\nCheck-Your-Health   (CHS)  programme  in  identifying   those\r\n\r\nelderly  with  undiagnosed diabetes,  hypertension  and  high\r\n\r\nblood  cholesterol.  From the launch of CHS in July  2000  to\r\n\r\nFebruary  2002,  40,230 persons have been screened,  and  the\r\n\r\noverall  participation rate is 24%.  But,  more  importantly,\r\n\r\namong  those  screened,  about  60%  had  not  attended   any\r\n\r\nscreening  before, and 60% of the participants,  who  had  no\r\n\r\nprevious history, were detected with abnormal result  at  the\r\n\r\nscreening.   70%  of  those  who were  referred  for  further\r\n\r\nmanagement  consulted a doctor within three months  of  their\r\n\r\nscreening.   Therefore, this programme  has  been  useful  in\r\n\r\nhelping residents diagnose the three common diseases, and  in\r\n\r\nenabling  them to seek early treatment, and in ensuring  them\r\n\r\nto  lead a healthier and happier life.  I do believe that CHS\r\n\r\nis  a  worthwhile  programme and should continue  to  receive\r\n\r\nfunding  for screening even more of our elderly.  I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will consider this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Mammogram Screening/Breast Screening\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  a  population-based breast  cancer  screening\r\n\r\nprogramme launched since January 2002, has been so successful\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  overwhelmed by the demand for such  screening.\r\n\r\nTwo  months  after its launch, the Breast Screen Call  Centre\r\n\r\nreceived  about  12,500 calls.  About 9,000 women  have  been\r\n\r\ngiven  screening mammography appointments, but of these  only\r\n\r\n5,380  have  been screened as there are only four polyclinics\r\n\r\noffering  screening mammography services.  I  know  that  MOH\r\n\r\nplans  to  open more screening centres to cope with the  huge\r\n\r\ndemand, and I hope MOH will do this expeditiously to cut  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  time for women who have registered for screening  so\r\n\r\nthat more women can be screened more quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health, Sir, must ensure continuity and\r\n\r\nlasting   follow  through  of  all  efforts   on   preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare.    For   example,  in  those  cancers   affecting\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,     especially    those     with     hereditary\r\n\r\npredisposition,  there  should be a programme  in  place  for\r\n\r\nimmediate  family  members  of  affected  individuals  to  be\r\n\r\nscreened  for  specific  cancers.   There  should  be  public\r\n\r\neducation targeted at these families to improve understanding\r\n\r\nthat they are more prone to certain cancers.  By being target-specific,  it  will  be more cost effective,  especially  for\r\n\r\nthose  cancers  that  are too expensive for  screening  as  a\r\n\r\nnational programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example concerns mental health, which has not\r\n\r\nreceived  its due attention.  There must be new  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nmental  health as the present rate of depression in Singapore\r\n\r\nis 8.6% now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since morbidity and mortality from any disease can\r\n\r\nbe  dramatically reduced when the disease is treated  in  the\r\n\r\nearly stages, more emphasis should now be given to our people\r\n\r\nin  the younger age group.  Heart diseases are a major  cause\r\n\r\nof  death  presently, and are likely to increase in incidence\r\n\r\nunder  present trends.  Heart diseases would take  root  when\r\n\r\npeople  are  still  young,  in view  of  the  kind  of  diet,\r\n\r\nlifestyle  and  predisposing medical  conditions  which  they\r\n\r\nhave.  We need to target them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor   increased  public  education  in  this   respect,   and\r\n\r\nfacilitate  them  in  early  disease  detection   and   early\r\n\r\nprevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, targeting this adult group population needs much\r\n\r\ncreativity, funding and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, as reported in the Business\r\n\r\nWeek,  27th  May issue, the American National  Mental  Health\r\n\r\nAssociation  estimates that 19 million or one  in  every  ten\r\n\r\nadults suffers some form of depression in a given year.   The\r\n\r\ntotal  retail sales of the anti-depressant medicine  in  year\r\n\r\n2001  alone  was  US$12.5 billion.  Why I mentioned  this  is\r\n\r\nbecause,  Sir, we are not much better.  Our Annual  State  of\r\n\r\nHealth  Year  2000  Report, for example,  cited  a  study  on\r\n\r\ndepression, that found a prevailing rate of 8.6%.  The number\r\n\r\nof  new cases of young people under 18 visiting psychiatrists\r\n\r\nin  our Government clinics also doubled from 1,126 in 1990 to\r\n\r\n2,491 cases in the year 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have done quite a bit for the promotion of\r\n\r\nphysical  health.   I  think  now  we  need  to  do  more  in\r\n\r\npreventive  mental  healthcare.  I  would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  whether it has plans to do more in  mental  health\r\n\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan Cheng Bock you may take both cuts\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> I remember in the last\r\n\r\nParliament we were talking about case-mix, and I often wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  Members  of this House really understand  what  this\r\n\r\nterm  means.   But,  I  think  Members  in  this  House  must\r\n\r\nunderstand  case-mix because the subject that I am  going  to\r\n\r\ntalk about actually is related to case-mix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would try to be very brief and just be as simple as\r\n\r\npossible so that you all can really appreciate what I want to\r\n\r\nsay.   Very  briefly, case-mix to me is actually  a  patient-management programme, ie, to improve the care of the patients\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhospitals with minimal wastage.  So guidelines were then  set\r\n\r\nto  make  sure that doctors manage patients effectively,  and\r\n\r\ndischarge them at the earliest opportune time.  To make  sure\r\n\r\nthis happens, funding to the hospital is related to this,  so\r\n\r\nthat you will have to make sure that the patients you see are\r\n\r\nwithin that funding limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you a very easy example so that you can\r\n\r\nfollow  me.  Let us take the example of a patient with  acute\r\n\r\nappendicitis,  and assuming that they have gone  through  all\r\n\r\nthe  records,  and  they think maybe a 4-day  stay  would  be\r\n\r\nsufficient,  to manage and treat patients with  appendicitis.\r\n\r\nAnd,  that should be the length of period that he is  allowed\r\n\r\nto  stay. Let us say, if he exceeds that period, then funding\r\n\r\nwould be reduced or even stopped.  So it makes administrators\r\n\r\nof  such  hospitals  to think very carefully  and  to  advise\r\n\r\ndoctors  that  they should try to treat the  patients  within\r\n\r\nthat 4-day period.  However, I am sure sometimes the patients\r\n\r\nhave  no  choice.   Cases  do get complicated  at  times  and\r\n\r\ntherefore it exceeds the 4-day stay, and when you do that,  I\r\n\r\nthink  administrators  of hospitals  will  be  a  little  bit\r\n\r\nuncomfortable  because they see that their  funding  will  be\r\n\r\ncurtailed.  You cannot blame them because they have  to  look\r\n\r\nat the bottom line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what actually happens is that you might really get\r\n\r\nsome  patients  being discharged earlier  than  they  should,\r\n\r\nbecause as I said, they need to look at the bottom line.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  I was so sad when I heard Dr Michael Lim mention about\r\n\r\na  young couple with a child going to KK Hospital and finding\r\n\r\ndifficulty  to  seek  admission.  And what  is  more  is  the\r\n\r\ncontent of the letter, the reply to Dr Michael Lim, attaching\r\n\r\nthe  importance of cost to this.  We all understand cost, but\r\n\r\nsometimes  the  way the letter was written, I  think,  really\r\n\r\nhurt  him.   That is why he probably brought up this  matter.\r\n\r\nNow,  you also can understand how case-mix, because the  fear\r\n\r\nof  less subvention, I suspect that some of the cases may  be\r\n\r\ndischarged earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I am coming to this House to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister to be more generous in the funding to all these step-down care facilities that are provided by volunteers and also\r\n\r\nby   some   of  our  own  Government  agencies.     Step-down\r\n\r\nfacilities  are  of  various kinds.  You  have  the  day-care\r\n\r\ncentres.  You have your occupational centres.  You have  your\r\n\r\nrehabilitation centres, and so on.  But I think  these  high-end  step-down cases are quite special because  the  patients\r\n\r\nreally  need post-hospital care - hospital setting to  manage\r\n\r\nthat  difficult period.  I think our outpatient  clinics  are\r\n\r\nnot  able  to  do  that because they do not  have  in-staying\r\n\r\npatients.   Community hospitals can do the  job  but  when  I\r\n\r\nheard  Dr Ong mention about the new funding, there is a means\r\n\r\ntest  that is being bandied around, and they want to  have  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  way of funding.  When I heard Dr Ong  talking  and\r\n\r\nbeing  worried  that subvention grants may  be  curtailed,  I\r\n\r\nworry  that  some of these facilities, ie, the high-end  ones\r\n\r\nand  even  the lower end ones, they might trim facilities  or\r\n\r\nthey might even close down some of the facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that the Minister will give assurance to all\r\n\r\nthese  people who put so much effort in setting up all  these\r\n\r\nfacilities, not only grants but also a lot more support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The means test has been mentioned. So to cut short, I\r\n\r\nshall not speak so much on means test.  It has been very well\r\n\r\narticulated by Dr Ong.  I think he can do it better  than  I.\r\n\r\nI  shall  now  move  on  to ask just a  few  questions  about\r\n\r\noutpatient clinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outpatient clinics have done a remarkably good job.\r\n\r\nThey  are  the first line of defence, the primary healthcare.\r\n\r\nSince  we  are  talking about remaking of  Singapore,  I  was\r\n\r\nwondering  whether the outpatient clinics would  also  remake\r\n\r\ntheir  role.   Perhaps  we  should  make  some  collaboration\r\n\r\nstudies  with  the  private  practitioners  to  open  up  the\r\n\r\nfacilities for better use.  We spend so much money  providing\r\n\r\nall  the  facilities to outpatients.  Maybe  we  could  share\r\n\r\nthese facilities with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  private  practitioners to ensure better service  to  our\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, like my colleagues before me, I\r\n\r\nam concerned with the way in which the prices of prescriptive\r\n\r\ndrugs are being regulated in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From anecdotal evidence, and as well as illustrated by\r\n\r\nComrade  Ong  Ah Heng earlier on, we know that  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nprescriptive drugs in this country can be just as  expensive,\r\n\r\nif  not  more expensive than similar drugs found in countries\r\n\r\nsuch  as Australia and New Zealand.  As a matter of fact,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  just  patients  but even doctors  in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\ndriving  up  to  Johor to buy prescriptive  drugs  for  their\r\n\r\nclinics  because  they  are  cheaper  than  those  found   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister enlighten us as to whether there is a\r\n\r\nregulatory  body in Singapore that monitors prices  by  which\r\n\r\ndrugs  are  sold  in Singapore to ensure  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\novercharging?  If there is indeed such a body, may I ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister to share the measures that his Ministry has taken to\r\n\r\nkeep  drug prices affordable?  If there is not such  a  body,\r\n\r\nwould the Ministry consider setting up one?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question stems from the concern that there is an\r\n\r\nabsence   of  transparency  in  the  pricing  of  proprietary\r\n\r\nmedicines and vitamins in Singapore and from the concern that\r\n\r\nour  costs may be too prohibitive relative to that prevailing\r\n\r\nin  developed  countries.   Just  to  give  two  examples  on\r\n\r\nvitamins.  For vitamins like Nature's Farm vitamin E 500 soft\r\n\r\ngel pack of 50 tablets, I know that they can be purchased  in\r\n\r\nJohor  at half the price of what we have to pay in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  was  also  told  by  a resident during my  meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsession  that for calcium tablets that come in a pack  of  30\r\n\r\ntablets that he purchases from SGH pharmacy at something like\r\n\r\n30% discount, he has to pay $21 per pack.  For a similar type\r\n\r\nof calcium tablets, he was told by his son that he needs only\r\n\r\nto pay A$7.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related matter, I would also like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister to clarify whether there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  measures  taken  by  the hospitals  to  make  sure  that\r\n\r\npatients  are not being prescribed drugs which are marginally\r\n\r\nmore  effective than other drugs, but for which the price  is\r\n\r\nfar higher than the other equally effective drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> I thank Dr Lily Neo for having good things to say about our\r\n\r\npreventive   healthcare  programme.   The  community   health\r\n\r\nscreening programme has indeed been very successful since its\r\n\r\nimplementation two years ago.  My Ministry will  continue  to\r\n\r\npromote  and provide for this community screening  programme.\r\n\r\nForty  districts  have already been covered.   We  intend  to\r\n\r\ncover another 48 by next year, and after that this will be an\r\n\r\non-going  programme.  And those who have  gone  through  once\r\n\r\nwill   go  through  again.   So  this  will  be  an  on-going\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national breast cancer screening programme has also\r\n\r\nbeen  extremely successful and large numbers of  people  have\r\n\r\ncalled  to have appointments for the screening.  But I think,\r\n\r\nwith  time, the demand for the screening will level  out  and\r\n\r\nthen  the  waiting  time  for  screening  would  become  much\r\n\r\nshorter.   The  Ministry  is also increasing  the  number  of\r\n\r\npolyclinics that will have this facility from eight to 11  by\r\n\r\nthe end of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Lily Neo and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang have brought up\r\n\r\ntheir  concerns about mental health.  We need a healthy  mind\r\n\r\nto  deal  with the current problems that Singapore is facing.\r\n\r\nMy  Ministry  recognises the importance of  promoting  mental\r\n\r\nhealth  among  Singaporeans.  To place  greater  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nmental  health,  a mental health education programme,  called\r\n\r\n\"Mind  your  Mind\",  was implemented in 2001  by  the  Health\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board  and the Institute of  Mental  Health.   The\r\n\r\nprogramme aims to promote mental wellness and raise awareness\r\n\r\nof the importance of early screening, detection and treatment\r\n\r\nof  the  common mental conditions such as stress, depression,\r\n\r\nanxiety disorders and schizophrenia.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogramme  is  targeted  at  all Singaporeans,  children  and\r\n\r\nadolescents, adults and the elderly.  We are using a  variety\r\n\r\nof strategies to reach out to the target groups.  Mass media,\r\n\r\ntalks  and  forums are carried out to create public awareness\r\n\r\nof  the  importance of mental health.  To  impart  skills  to\r\n\r\nhealthcare  professionals for the early  detection  of  these\r\n\r\nmental  conditions and mental stress problems  that  patients\r\n\r\nmay  have,  workshops and training courses are being  carried\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to Dr Tan Cheng Bock's concerns about case-mix and step-down facilities. First of all, I want to\r\n\r\nclarify what case-mix is.  Case-mix is a statistical  way  of\r\n\r\nreimbursing  hospitals.  What happens is that an  average  is\r\n\r\ntaken  for  a  condition,  based on the  cumulative  cost  of\r\n\r\ntreating  the  condition  in the population  divided  by  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people who have that condition.  So the hospitals\r\n\r\nwill  make  some  profit in some cases and  losses  in  other\r\n\r\ncases.  But, overall, the hospitals will not be worse off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found in the United States that the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of case-mix or case-mix like systems  leads  to\r\n\r\nefficiency  in  the  hospitals.  For  case-mix  to  work,  it\r\n\r\nrequires  doctors to be professional and that  doctors  would\r\n\r\ntreat patients not using case-mix criteria but treat patients\r\n\r\naccording to what patients need.  If administrators do  their\r\n\r\njob   and  look  at  the  bottomline,  and  if  doctors   act\r\n\r\nprofessionally and treat patients as they should be  treated,\r\n\r\nwhat  we  will  end  up  having is an efficient  system  that\r\n\r\nprovides healthcare for Singaporeans as well as providing the\r\n\r\ncorrect treatment for patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to step-down facilities, over the last 10\r\n\r\nyears MOH has been putting in place facilities and programmes\r\n\r\nto  meet  the requirements of an aging population.   We  have\r\n\r\nfive  community hospitals, 16 VWOs' nursing homes and 21  day\r\n\r\nrehabilitation centres.  These have been set up  at  a  total\r\n\r\nGovernment subsidy of $225 million for capital cost and  $200\r\n\r\nmillion for recurrent funding.  Another $82 million has  been\r\n\r\nprovided for the financial year.  So my Ministry has a  great\r\n\r\nconcern  that  there are sufficient step-down facilities  for\r\n\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to means testing, the Minister has already\r\n\r\nexplained the rationale for means testing, and I will not  go\r\n\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan also asked about the polyclinics and their\r\n\r\ncooperation with general practitioners.  Our polyclinics  try\r\n\r\nto  work  with  general practitioners  in  the  community  to\r\n\r\nprovide  effective and efficient service for  the  community.\r\n\r\nAmong   the  areas  of  cooperation  between  GPs   and   the\r\n\r\npolyclinics  are that polyclinics allow patients referred  by\r\n\r\nGPs  to  use  their services such as X-rays, mammography  and\r\n\r\nlaboratory   services.   These  patients  are  charged   non-subsidised  rates.   X-rays  and  mammography  services   are\r\n\r\nrelatively  well utilised by the GPs.  Patients  referred  by\r\n\r\nGPs  constitute half of X-ray workload and a quarter  of  the\r\n\r\nmammography  workload in some polyclinics.  These  are  clear\r\n\r\nindications of the level of cooperation between the  GPs  and\r\n\r\npolyclinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, patients referred by GPs can undergo\r\n\r\ndiabetic  eye screening at polyclinics.  They can also  refer\r\n\r\npatients  to  purchase  drugs from the retail  pharmacies  in\r\n\r\npolyclinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho brought up the question of cost of medication.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore, as a whole, we spend approximately $450 million\r\n\r\non  prescription  drugs annually.  Generic products  make  up\r\n\r\njust  over  10%  ($54 million) of the local market.   Various\r\n\r\nbranded  proprietary  drugs  account  for  about  90%   ($396\r\n\r\nmillion).  Branded drugs are produced by the major R&D  based\r\n\r\npharmaceutical companies.  They are generally higher  priced.\r\n\r\nThese  companies  control the prices of the medication  while\r\n\r\nthey  are under patent protection, in order to recover  their\r\n\r\nR&D  costs.   They might price their products differently  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  countries, and we do not have direct control  over\r\n\r\nthese companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a great difference in price between a\r\n\r\ngeneric and a branded drug.  So, it is possible, for example,\r\n\r\nin calcium supplements, if you buy branded medication, it may\r\n\r\ncost many, many times more than a generic calcium supplement.\r\n\r\nSo this may explain why there is such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  difference  in  price with regard to the  person  who  has\r\n\r\nbought it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we do not have a regulatory body to\r\n\r\ncontrol drug prices, and the market is allowed to set its own\r\n\r\nprice.  The Ministry of Health does not intend to set up such\r\n\r\na  regulatory agency.  However, the Ministry of  Health  does\r\n\r\nmonitor the price trends of pharmaceuticals through the  data\r\n\r\navailable   from  the  group  purchasing  office  that   buys\r\n\r\nmedicines  for  the  two  hospital  clusters.   However,   in\r\n\r\nresponse  to  concerns expressed by the public  on  the  high\r\n\r\nprices of medicines in Singapore, the Ministry did commission\r\n\r\na  study  by  a task force.  The task force has made  several\r\n\r\nrecommendations.   We  are studying the  recommendations  and\r\n\r\nwould decide on some measures maybe later in the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Just a small point of clarification\r\n\r\non  GP and OPD cooperation.  I just want to find out that, in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  when  a GP referred a patient to  the  outpatient\r\n\r\nclinic  and  he was referred to the hospital,  he  paid  very\r\n\r\nlittle,  ie,  only the C class rate if he could  not  afford.\r\n\r\nBut  now I learn that, by way of the same procedure,  let  us\r\n\r\nsay, if a patient is referred from the GP to the OPD and then\r\n\r\nto  the hospital, he is now charged more when he goes to  the\r\n\r\nhospital.   I  am  not  sure whether this  is  true  or  not.\r\n\r\nWithout  the  GP's  letter, he is charged less,  that  means,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no point for the patient to go and get a  referral\r\n\r\nletter from the GP any more.  If he gets a direct referral by\r\n\r\nthe  OPD to the hospital, it is cheaper.  But through a  GP's\r\n\r\nletter, it is more.  In the past, it was not, because some of\r\n\r\nthe   patients   have  told  me.   So  I  am   just   seeking\r\n\r\nclarification.  You may not be able to answer it,  but  never\r\n\r\nmind, you can give me an answer later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> I think where a GP refers a\r\n\r\npatient to a Specialist Clinic ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> No, it is not a Specialist Clinic.\r\n\r\nIt is just to the hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> In this area, the two clusters\r\n\r\nhave  been  working with the GPs to try to come out  with  an\r\n\r\nefficient system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  admitting  patients to the hospital.

So as  long\r\n\r\nas  doctors do their job correctly and, say, this patient, in\r\n\r\nfact,  needs  to stay 10 days, we will give the  patient  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy for the average of four days, the statistical  method\r\n\r\nunder  case-mix, and the additional six days on  a  per  diem\r\n\r\nbasis.

This  is   a\r\n\r\nsignificant change in our healthcare policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also more subtle changes in our healthcare\r\n\r\ndelivery  system.  For instance, in our attempt to take  away\r\n\r\nsome of the pressure on the demand for hospital beds, we have\r\n\r\nintroduced  step-down care services.  In  other  words,  when\r\n\r\nsomeone suffers from an acute illness, for example, a  stroke\r\n\r\nor  heart attack, he will be admitted to a hospital, such  as\r\n\r\nSGH  or  NUH.   After that, the patient is on a  recuperative\r\n\r\nstage  and,  hence, does not need the services  of  an  acute\r\n\r\nhospital.   Step-down  care services henceforth  will  be  in\r\n\r\ngreater  demand and will increase in importance, in the  near\r\n\r\nfuture, in our fast ageing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge MOH to place emphasis on one\r\n\r\nof  the newer approaches to healthcare delivery systems  and,\r\n\r\nthat  is, domiciliary medical care, a form of step-down  care\r\n\r\nservices.   When  a  patient  is  discharged  from  an  acute\r\n\r\ncommunity  hospital,  most of these  patients  still  require\r\n\r\nfollow-up  treatment.  In many of these cases, they  are  not\r\n\r\nfully  ambulant,  such as post-stroke patients  and  patients\r\n\r\nafter amputation.  It would be a chore for these patients  to\r\n\r\ngo  for follow-up treatment at the institutions.  Thus, there\r\n\r\nis a need for the concept of domiciliary care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this consists of would be a team of professionals,\r\n\r\nsuch as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists.  They will  get\r\n\r\nreferrals  from  hospitals and conduct  home  visits,  giving\r\n\r\ntreatment  and follow-up in the comfort of the homes  of  the\r\n\r\npatients,  who probably are home-bound.  The physiotherapists\r\n\r\nin  the  team could provide much needed treatment, especially\r\n\r\nfor  post-stroke  patients.  Currently,  these  services  are\r\n\r\nprovided by a handful of voluntary welfare organisations  and\r\n\r\nthe demand far exceeds supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another advantage of such a system will go towards\r\n\r\nbringing  down national healthcare expenditure  (NHE).   When\r\n\r\nthis type of service is in place, it will release demand  for\r\n\r\nhospital  beds, as there are certain groups of  patients  who\r\n\r\ncould  be discharged earlier to recuperate in the comfort  of\r\n\r\ntheir  homes.  And this group of patients would include those\r\n\r\non intravenous drugs, those who are recuperating from stroke,\r\n\r\nas  well  as  those  post-operation cases.   And  this  would\r\n\r\nbenefit  very  much from home physiotherapy, or home  medical\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would urge the Ministry to (1) encourage more\r\n\r\norganisations    to   provide   domiciliary    medical    and\r\n\r\nphysiotherapy services; and (2) to provide funding  for  such\r\n\r\norganisations who are willing to take up this difficult task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You may speak on the next cut, Dr Chong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> I would now go on to the cut on\r\n\r\nAIDS  patients.   HIV or AIDS patient is a feared  and,  yet,\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  disease.  As a medical doctor,  I  am  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion that we should not be judgemental.  Presently,  under\r\n\r\nthe  ElderCare Endowment Scheme, the Ministry of  Health  has\r\n\r\nrecently   sent  out  a  circular  requiring   all   approved\r\n\r\nhealthcare providers, meaning nursing homes and hospices,  to\r\n\r\nadmit   all  Singaporeans  and  PRs,  regardless  of  disease\r\n\r\ncondition, including HIV positive or AIDS patients.   Failing\r\n\r\nto  do  so  might  result  in  revocation  or  suspension  of\r\n\r\nsubvention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, AIDS patients, like all patients, desire to be\r\n\r\ntreated  fairly.   They  should not be discriminated  against\r\n\r\nbecause  of  their  disease.  Since the  disease  is  such  a\r\n\r\ndreaded  one,  I would urge the Ministry of Health  to  be  a\r\n\r\nlittle   bit  more  sympathetic  to  approved  providers   in\r\n\r\nrequiring them to accept AIDS patients.  Many of the approved\r\n\r\nproviders  are  prepared  to accept patients,  regardless  of\r\n\r\ntheir  diseases,  and  are  preparing  their  staff  for  the\r\n\r\neventuality.  However, they appeal to the Ministry of  Health\r\n\r\nfor  a little more flexibility and time as they find it tough\r\n\r\nconvincing their staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some service providers are already experiencing a loss\r\n\r\nof  staff  over  this  issue.  Others are  prepared  to  lose\r\n\r\nGovernment's subvention if they have no other choices.  There\r\n\r\nare   also   some  approved  providers  who  have   volunteer\r\n\r\ncaregivers  in their set-up.  And it is difficult  to  retain\r\n\r\nvoluntary  help over the issue of accepting and working  with\r\n\r\nAIDS patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while some of us are comfortable in dealing with\r\n\r\nHIV  positive or AIDS patients, I am afraid the community  at\r\n\r\nlarge is just not ready.  Thus, I would urge the Ministry  to\r\n\r\ngive  the  approved providers more flexibility  and  time  in\r\n\r\npreparing  the staff in accepting AIDS patients  under  their\r\n\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, Dr Chong Weng Chiew brought\r\n\r\nup  the  issue  of domiciliary home care.  This is  something\r\n\r\nthat  my  Ministry supports. There are now six VWOs providing\r\n\r\nhome medical services.  Home medical care is the provision of\r\n\r\na  doctor's  care in the person's own home as the person  has\r\n\r\ndifficulty leaving his home because of severe disability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home nursing services usually involve dressing of\r\n\r\nwounds,   injections,  changing  of  catheters,   etc.    The\r\n\r\navailability  of home medical and home nursing  can  help  to\r\n\r\nreduce the need for nursing home beds.  MOH is in the process\r\n\r\nof  finalising the norm cost for home medical care  and  home\r\n\r\nnursing  care  after which subsidised home medical  and  home\r\n\r\nnursing  care will be available to those who pass  the  means\r\n\r\ntest and will seek such care from the various VWO providers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability of Government subvention for home\r\n\r\nmedical  and  home nursing will also encourage  more  service\r\n\r\nproviders.   This is an expansion of current  services  which\r\n\r\nhave  been limited to the seven approved providers under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  framework  for  integrated  healthcare  for   the\r\n\r\nelderly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to physiotherapy, home medical and home\r\n\r\nnursing  providers  will  instruct  the  patients  and  their\r\n\r\nrelatives on basic physiotherapy exercises.  For\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatients  who require more specialised physiotherapy  inputs,\r\n\r\nhome   physiotherapy   is  provided  by   four   restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals.   There are eight private physiotherapy  providers\r\n\r\nand  they  do  not  have  a waiting list.   The  Ministry  is\r\n\r\ncurrently reviewing the continuum of rehabilitation  services\r\n\r\nand  whether  there  is a need to expand home  physiotherapy,\r\n\r\nparticularly   as   the   previous   severe    shortage    of\r\n\r\nphysiotherapists  is being addressed with the  local  diploma\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Dr Chong's concern about HIV/AIDS\r\n\r\npatients,  MOH has announced in December 2000 that  hospices,\r\n\r\nnursing  homes and community hospitals should accept HIV/AIDS\r\n\r\npatients,  and they will receive subsidies for  them  as  for\r\n\r\nother  patients.   A  comprehensive  training  programme   on\r\n\r\ninfection  control and HIV/AIDS has been organised for  step-down care staff and is on-going.   This programme teaches the\r\n\r\nstaff how to manage patients with infectious diseases so that\r\n\r\nthe  handler  knows  how  to take  precautions.   Caring  for\r\n\r\nHIV/AIDS  patient  is no different from caring  for  patients\r\n\r\nwith  other infectious disease.  Universal precaution  should\r\n\r\nbe  practised  by all service providers for all  patients  to\r\n\r\nprevent  infection.   It  is not medical  knowledge  that  is\r\n\r\nlacking, but the fear of nursing these patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training programme will further address such psycho-social issues to reduce discrimination against HIV/AIDS\r\n\r\npatients.    Currently,  the  number  of  HIV/AIDS   patients\r\n\r\nrequiring  nursing home care is small.  We feel that  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes  should not discriminate against HIV/AIDS  patients  or\r\n\r\npatients  with  other  conditions who  meet  MOH's  admission\r\n\r\ncriteria  for nursing homes.  We believe, with education  and\r\n\r\ntraining,  nursing home care providers and nursing staff  and\r\n\r\nother  caregivers can be taught to look after these  patients\r\n\r\nwithout fear of catching the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Dr\r\n\r\nBalaji  for  the answers he has given.

As a result, many members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public take herbal medicines freely for various ailments\r\n\r\nand  as health supplements.  Even our regulation shows a lack\r\n\r\nof  knowledge  of the pharmacology and toxicology  of  herbal\r\n\r\nproducts.   This is evidenced by the fact that our regulation\r\n\r\nis  only  concerned  with the contents of  heavy  metals  and\r\n\r\nadulteration  of western prescribed medicine  in  the  herbal\r\n\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Minister commented that these herbs have been\r\n\r\nused  for  hundreds of years and, therefore, they  should  be\r\n\r\nsafe.  The fact is that a number of herbs themselves actually\r\n\r\ncontain chemicals that may interact with other drugs or cause\r\n\r\nvarious  bodily  damage  directly,  if  taken  in  sufficient\r\n\r\nquantities.   Many such cases have actually been reported  in\r\n\r\nvarious  medical literature.  They resulted in kidney,  liver\r\n\r\nand  other  organ failures.  Sometimes, some of  these  cases\r\n\r\nwere even fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge that while the Ministry tightens up the control\r\n\r\non  adulteration of western medicine in herbal  products,  it\r\n\r\nshould  also  build  up  a pharmacopedia  of  all  the  herbs\r\n\r\ncommonly  used  locally,  and use this  knowledge  to  better\r\n\r\nregulate  the  importation and production of herbal  products\r\n\r\nsince  so  many  Singaporeans actually  use  them  regularly.\r\n\r\nThen,  with  this  knowledge, I also  urge  the  Ministry  to\r\n\r\neducate the public on the safety aspect of herbal medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, alternative medicine is\r\n\r\nalso  widely practised in western countries like the USA,  so\r\n\r\nit is not surprising that alternative medicine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis also a choice of therapy for many Singaporeans.  While the\r\n\r\nMinistry  finds it difficult to regulate efficacy  as  it  is\r\n\r\njust primarily regulating safety, the Ministry can perform  a\r\n\r\nrole  in  letting the public know what forms  of  alternative\r\n\r\nmedicine are allowed to be practised here, because the public\r\n\r\ndoes  not  know  what  is  an accepted  form  of  alternative\r\n\r\nmedicine and what is not.  For example: is chelation  therapy\r\n\r\nor  other forms of aromatherapy accepted as regular types  of\r\n\r\nalternative medicine?  So the Ministry can perform a role  by\r\n\r\nhelping us understand what types of alternative medicine  can\r\n\r\nbe practised here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, while it may not be able to regulate efficacy,\r\n\r\nit  can  perform a role in preventing unsubstantiated  claims\r\n\r\nfrom  being  made.   For example, some of these  preparations\r\n\r\nclaim  that they can cure cancer or diabetes.  The danger  in\r\n\r\ndoing  so  is that this will mislead persons into taking  the\r\n\r\nmedication, leading to further complications.  What  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to know is whether there are any agencies to look  into\r\n\r\nthese  advertising claims.  While I can understand that  some\r\n\r\nof  these  alternative treatments can claim to improve  well-being,  I  think  that is fine.  But once they  start  making\r\n\r\nclaims about curing diseases, the Ministry has to draw a fine\r\n\r\nline.

The TCM Practitioners Act 2000 came into effect  on\r\n\r\n7th  February  2001 with the commencement of registration  of\r\n\r\nacupuncturists.  This was successfully carried out  in  2001.\r\n\r\nThe  registration of TCM physicians started on 28th  February\r\n\r\n2002,  and  all TCM physicians are required to be registered,\r\n\r\nas a condition to practise, by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1st  January  2004.

But many of these herbs and medications have  been\r\n\r\ntaken for thousands of years and patients have felt better as\r\n\r\na result of taking these medications, and very few reports of\r\n\r\nactually serious illness have been reported from taking these\r\n\r\nmedications.   Where  there have been complications,  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen because of adulteration of these Chinese medicines.   If\r\n\r\nwe  were  to  impose  western standards of  trials  on  these\r\n\r\ntraditional  Chinese medications, what will  happen  is  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will be deprived of the ability to  have  these\r\n\r\nmedications.

Sir,  we  have\r\n\r\nvery  strict regulations on how western medicine is practised\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  including  most of the  medications  used  in\r\n\r\nwestern  medicine  being  placed  on  the  Schedule  List  of\r\n\r\nPoisons.   Nobody  can prescribe these medications  except  a\r\n\r\nperson   registered  with  the  Singapore  Medical   Council.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there have been many forms of treatment  that  have\r\n\r\ntraditionally  been  done.   These  include  treatments  like\r\n\r\nbinding of the abdomen after pregnancy, which is quite common\r\n\r\namong  the Malay population.  It is not the intention of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to regulate all these practices.  Our goal mainly is\r\n\r\nto  ensure that there is no practice that would pose a danger\r\n\r\nto the public.  I believe our current system gives the public\r\n\r\naccess  to the greatest number of choices that they can  make\r\n\r\nand, at the same time, safeguards them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, just a quick clarification.

Some medical experts\r\n\r\nbelieve  deaths from Hepatitis C will triple in the  next  20\r\n\r\nyears.   Many  infected  with  the  blood-borne  virus  would\r\n\r\nrequire liver transplants, and between 1% and 4% of sufferers\r\n\r\nwould  develop  liver cancer.  Hepatitis C is now  the  major\r\n\r\ncause  of liver disease requiring liver transplantation among\r\n\r\nadults in most countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the development of reliable diagnostic tests has\r\n\r\nshown  how widespread the disease is but, because few victims\r\n\r\nshow   symptoms,   it  is  often  detected   during   routine\r\n\r\nexaminations or at blood donations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister for Health whether any study has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  to  ascertain the prevalence of  Hepatitis  C  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Will the Ministry of Health embark on preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures in tackling Hepatitis C?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no vaccine against the Hepatitis C virus,\r\n\r\nunlike  Hepatitis B and Hepatitis A.  Will  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth prioritise research to find a vaccine for Hepatitis C,\r\n\r\nmuch  in  step with our present emphasis on medical and  bio-scientific  research?   Also, will  the  Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nconsider screening of Hepatitis C in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nroutine ante-natal check-ups so that gynaecologists can  take\r\n\r\nprecautions in minimising the transmission of Hepatitis  from\r\n\r\nmother to child?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, in the February issue of\r\n\r\nReaders'  Digest, there was a report that cigarette companies\r\n\r\nare  targetting  young Asian women and  teenage  girls  in  a\r\n\r\ncampaign to persuade them to take up smoking.  I was troubled\r\n\r\nby  the  report.  Nowadays, when we look around, we see  more\r\n\r\nsmokers  among  our  Singapore  youths,  particularly   young\r\n\r\nfemales.   Most  female smokers smoke with friends  and  they\r\n\r\nperceive smoking as socially desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, tobacco taxation has been used to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  smoking.  The tax has been adjusted  to  increase\r\n\r\nfrom  $180  to $210 per kg of cigarettes.  The tax  increase,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  of  course, will further deter  smokers,  but  more\r\n\r\nneeds to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry to step up its efforts to tackle the\r\n\r\nproblem of youth smoking.  In the United States, 90%  of  all\r\n\r\nadult  smokers report that they began smoking before the  age\r\n\r\nof  18.  Most researchers agree that prevention should  begin\r\n\r\nearly and continued intervention should be provided for young\r\n\r\npeople.   If  tobacco  companies focus their  advertising  to\r\n\r\nencourage  young  women  to take  up  smoking,  we  too,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health, must also step up our drive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, my Ministry shares Dr Lily\r\n\r\nNeo's concern about Hepatitis C because both Hepatitis B  and\r\n\r\nHepatitis C infections can cause liver cancer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of Hepatitis B on the incidence of liver\r\n\r\ncancer is a greater concern as about 4% of the population are\r\n\r\nHepatitis B carriers.  The Hepatitis B Control Programme,  of\r\n\r\nwhich immunisation is a main strategy, is in place to address\r\n\r\nthis concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hepatitis C virus, like Hepatitis B virus, is\r\n\r\ntransmitted through blood and body\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfluids  containing the virus. Acute viral  Hepatitis  due  to\r\n\r\nHepatitis  C  virus  is uncommon in Singapore.   Acute  viral\r\n\r\nHepatitis,  including  Hepatitis C  viral  infections,  is  a\r\n\r\nnotifiable  disease  but  no  case  of  Hepatitis   C   virus\r\n\r\ninfections  has been reported since 1993.  The prevalence  of\r\n\r\nantibody  against  Hepatitis C indicating active  chronic  or\r\n\r\nresolved  infection in the general population  is  low,  less\r\n\r\nthan  0.5%.   As  no vaccine is available to protect  against\r\n\r\nHepatitis C infection, the only way to control the disease is\r\n\r\nto prevent transmission of Hepatitis C through infected blood\r\n\r\nand blood products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry has taken several measures to limit\r\n\r\nthe  spread of Hepatitis C.  Since 1992, all blood donors are\r\n\r\nroutinely  screened  for  anti-Hepatitis  C  virus  antibody.\r\n\r\nThose  found to be positive are excluded from blood donation.\r\n\r\nSince  1994, all haemodialysis centres are required to screen\r\n\r\ndialysis  patients  every six months.   A  separate  dialysis\r\n\r\nmachine  is  to be designated for use of any patient  who  is\r\n\r\nfound  positive  with Hepatitis C.  All  potential  life  and\r\n\r\ncadaveric organ donors are screened for Hepatitis C and those\r\n\r\nfound  to  be positive will be excluded.  Healthcare  workers\r\n\r\nare  continually  educated  on the importance  of  practising\r\n\r\nstandard  precautions  to  minimise  the  potential  risk  of\r\n\r\ntransmission  of blood-borne infections, including  Hepatitis\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an on-going public education on the risks of\r\n\r\ntransmission  of  blood-borne infections through  unprotected\r\n\r\nsexual  activities and sharing of contaminated  needles.   We\r\n\r\nthink the current measures taken are adequate to prevent  the\r\n\r\ntransmission of Hepatitis C virus in Singapore.  However, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  would continue to monitor the situation.  We  would\r\n\r\nwelcome  research  on  this virus  by  any  of  the  big  R&D\r\n\r\ncompanies.   With regard to the specific question of  whether\r\n\r\ngynaecologists  should screen patients for  Hepatitis  C,  we\r\n\r\nwill leave that to the professionals involved to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry also shares the concern Mr Yeo Guat Kwang\r\n\r\nhas   on  the  increasing  number  of  smokers  among   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  particularly those  aged  between  18  and  24\r\n\r\nyears.    We   recognise  the  importance   of   implementing\r\n\r\nprogrammes to prevent young people from taking up smoking.  A\r\n\r\nstudy  shows that it is more difficult for a person  to  quit\r\n\r\nsmoking  if  he starts smoking at a young age.  The  National\r\n\r\nSmoking  Control  Campaign  this year  will  be  targeted  at\r\n\r\nyouths. Strategies adopted will include mass media and  face-to-face education programmes.  The Health Promotion Board  is\r\n\r\nalso working with the Ministry of Education and the community\r\n\r\norganisations  to  implement programmes in  schools  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  to  encourage  youths to stay  smoke-free  and  to\r\n\r\nassist those who smoke to quit smoking.  Among the programmes\r\n\r\nthat  are being implemented are programmes like youth student\r\n\r\npeer  leaders, programme to train teachers to conduct smoking\r\n\r\ncessation  sessions, the promotion of soccer and rugby  as  a\r\n\r\nhealthy alternative to smoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the increasing number of young female\r\n\r\nsmokers,  the  Health  Promotion Board will  be  implementing\r\n\r\nspecific  programmes  targeted at young females.  A  renowned\r\n\r\nfemale  international model will be our spokesperson in  this\r\n\r\nyear's  media  publicity  programme.   Participants  in  this\r\n\r\nyear's  Teens Model Contest must also be smoke-free  and  the\r\n\r\nwinner will be our ambassador to speak on smoking issues.

Today,\r\n\r\nit  has  two  important objectives, namely,  to  prepare  our\r\n\r\nchildren  for the knowledge-based economy, and to  provide  a\r\n\r\ncommon development experience for all our children as part of\r\n\r\nnation-building.   However, it is also  the  source  of  much\r\n\r\nheadaches  and heartaches for our parents.  Its pull  on  the\r\n\r\nheartstrings of the nation is reflected in the number of cuts\r\n\r\nagainst  this  Ministry,  66 in total,  the  highest  in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentiment was also reflected in the five dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions   on  education  organised  by  the  Feedback   Unit\r\n\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, stress in our schools remains a major concern for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Many parents believe that the adverse  effects\r\n\r\nof  the  school  ranking  system on principals  and  teachers\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  this  problem.  Ranking,  for  instance,  has\r\n\r\nresulted in schools selecting subjects that would enable them\r\n\r\nto  score  well in their ranking and neglected subjects  that\r\n\r\nwould  cause  them  to rank lower.  English  Literature,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  is  no longer being offered in some  of  our  best\r\n\r\nsecondary   schools.   In  one  dialogue  session   involving\r\n\r\nprimarily  teachers, most of them were negative about  school\r\n\r\nranking.   This is interesting - the teachers themselves  are\r\n\r\nvery  negative about school ranking.  The teachers felt  that\r\n\r\nranking  tilts the balance of education in favour of academic\r\n\r\nexcellence versus the development of the young.  Many do  not\r\n\r\nfeel this singular pursuit that fulfilling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, streaming of primary school pupils is another\r\n\r\nperennial issue.  There is broad consensus that labelling  of\r\n\r\npupils  as  EM1, EM2 and EM3 brought about stigmatisation  of\r\n\r\nslow  pupils at a very young age.  Our angst about  labelling\r\n\r\nhas been captured very well by the movie \"I Not Stupid\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, school ranking and student streaming are\r\n\r\nboth  conceptually sound.  However, given the culture of  our\r\n\r\npeople,  its  implementation has  produced  undesirable  side\r\n\r\neffects.   We  should adapt the implementation to  real  life\r\n\r\nsituations where possible.  If appropriate, we should  modify\r\n\r\nthe  current policies on streaming and ranking after so  many\r\n\r\nyears  of  experience.  For instance, we could  offer,  as  a\r\n\r\nbenchmark  experiment for certain schools to abolish  ranking\r\n\r\nor  to curtail streaming to see whether the outcome would  be\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our mother tongue policy is a cornerstone of our\r\n\r\neducation  system.  There are altogether five  cuts  on  this\r\n\r\ntopic and two more on Chinese language.  I shall leave it  to\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues to elaborate on these topics.  Suffice to  say\r\n\r\nthat  mother  tongue  policy  has  so  far  been  sacrosanct.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I think we should review our implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe mother tongue policy in view of the irreversible trend of\r\n\r\nincreasing  number  of  families speaking  English  as  their\r\n\r\nmother tongue regardless of their ethnic background.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards secondary school curriculum, I believe there\r\n\r\nis   too   much   emphasis  on  academic   performance,   but\r\n\r\ninsufficient attention on character development  of  students\r\n\r\nand  cultivation  of values in them.  I  would  like  to  see\r\n\r\ngreater emphasis to be placed on developing soft skills, such\r\n\r\nas  critical thinking, research, presentation, communication,\r\n\r\nleadership  and  inter-personal skills.  These  skills  would\r\n\r\nenable  a  person  to  deal  with uncertainty  in  a  rapidly\r\n\r\nchanging world.  Currently, we have the \"A\" level examination\r\n\r\nwhich has a specialised and narrow focus.  On the other hand,\r\n\r\nthe local universities are reforming to provide a broad-based\r\n\r\neducation  along the line of the US universities.   Thus,  we\r\n\r\nhave this peculiar 'coca-cola' bottle shape when it comes  to\r\n\r\nthe  focus of our school curriculum, narrowing after the  \"O\"\r\n\r\nlevel and broadening again after the \"A\" level.  I believe we\r\n\r\nneed to address this anomaly as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a bold step for the Ministry to approve the\r\n\r\nsetting up of a sports school.  Regrettably, it is being off-loaded to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Community Development and Sports.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  has disclosed recently that  his  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nprepared to consider the establishment of speciality  schools\r\n\r\nin   arts  and  music  if  there  is   a  demand  for   them.\r\n\r\nPresumably, he would like to off-load it to MITA as well.   I\r\n\r\npersonally  would  like  the  Ministry  to  continue  to   be\r\n\r\nresponsible for these speciality schools, taking inputs  from\r\n\r\nthe other Ministries to buttress it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the \"A\" level examination, I am happy to\r\n\r\nnote   that   the  Senior  Minister  of  State,  Mr   Tharman\r\n\r\nShanmugaratnam, has disclosed in this House that project work\r\n\r\nwill  be  introduced  to \"A\" level examination  to  inculcate\r\n\r\nprocess skills and independent thinking amongst our students.\r\n\r\nI  think  all  these  could  be but  the  first  steps  of  a\r\n\r\ncontinuous process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry has been floating the idea of the\r\n\r\nthrough-train programme for a few years now.  I believe  this\r\n\r\nis  timely,  as  close  to  20% of  our  cohorts  proceed  to\r\n\r\nuniversity anyway.  Conceptually, if these students could  be\r\n\r\nidentified early, they could skip the \"O\" level examinations.\r\n\r\nThen,  the  students  will avoid having to  prepare  for  two\r\n\r\nexaminations  in the last three years of their pre-university\r\n\r\neducation.  This  through-train concept finds  broad  support\r\n\r\namong  school  principals and teachers, as well as  students.\r\n\r\nMany  students feel that this system will allow them to  skip\r\n\r\nthe  \"O\"  level  examination  and  give  them  more  in-depth\r\n\r\neducation  and a greater choice of subjects.  Some felt  that\r\n\r\nthe  integrated  programme  would  reduce  time  wastage  and\r\n\r\nprovide better linkage between the upper secondary and the JC\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ministry has not indicated when the\r\n\r\nselection of these students would take place.  The PSLE seems\r\n\r\nto  be  a  convenient choice.  However, this might be  a  bit\r\n\r\nearly  in a child's development and that would leave out  the\r\n\r\nlate  bloomers.  Given our culture, every parent  would  want\r\n\r\ntheir  children to get onto the through-train as  they  would\r\n\r\nlikely review it as a gravy train.  There is every likelihood\r\n\r\nthat the through-train programme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould end up being another streaming programme, with all  its\r\n\r\nattendant negative side effects.  We need to be very  careful\r\n\r\nin implementation to avoid these pitfalls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we come to education, we must talk about\r\n\r\nteachers as they are the anchors of any education system.   I\r\n\r\nhave participated in several rounds of the best teacher award\r\n\r\nselection.  I am touched by the commitments of our  teachers.\r\n\r\nAlso  from talking to my own school-going children, I  gather\r\n\r\nthat teachers play an important role in their motivation.   I\r\n\r\nam glad that we have improved on the remuneration of teachers\r\n\r\nand  the recognition of teachers' contributions. The NIE  has\r\n\r\nno shortage of applicants this year because of the recession.\r\n\r\nHopefully,  when the economic recession is over, we  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  continue  to  retain them.  This  is  an  area  the\r\n\r\nMinistry should continue to monitor closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the Government has pledged that it\r\n\r\nwould   leave  no  stone  unturned  in  remaking   Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhatever  we  do to remake Singapore would be an exercise  in\r\n\r\nfutility,  if  we do not, at the very least, throw  away  our\r\n\r\nhistorical  baggage, and look at the issue of  the  education\r\n\r\nsystem  with  a  fresh  perspective.  Although  we  have  not\r\n\r\nmentioned what is the size of the stone we are turning  over,\r\n\r\npresumably  these stones could be turned by a  single  person\r\n\r\nwith his hands.  The question is whether we have been turning\r\n\r\nthe  same  stones, over and over again, such  that  there  is\r\n\r\nreally  nothing  crawly and creepy underneath  them  anymore.\r\n\r\nInstead, I believe we should be bold enough to turn over some\r\n\r\nof the bigger boulders.  In the area of education, streaming,\r\n\r\nranking, mother tongue, could be some of these boulders.   We\r\n\r\nshould  be  true to our words, and not hold any  concept,  so\r\n\r\nsacrosanct,  that  we are prevented from  making  fundamental\r\n\r\nchanges  that  will mould Singapore for the future.   In  the\r\n\r\ncase of education, we truly have the future in our hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nChairman, all along, we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the firm belief that only through education can we  raise\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  our  people, extend  their  capability  and\r\n\r\nenhance  Singapore's competitiveness in the rapidly  changing\r\n\r\nworld of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integrity and excellence of our educational system\r\n\r\nis  beyond doubt.

I agree with my parliamentary  colleagues\r\n\r\nwho  have spoken before me that the Ministry of Education and\r\n\r\nthe  schools have done a lot of good things, and we  can  see\r\n\r\nthat  the contents of our education and the students that  we\r\n\r\nhave produced have attained international standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have attended a number of dialogue sessions with the\r\n\r\nwomen's  organisations  with Dr  Aline  Wong.   At  first,  I\r\n\r\nthought  that they would be most concerned with the  role  of\r\n\r\nwomen  in politics.  But, to my surprise, this ranks  5th  in\r\n\r\npriority whereas education topped the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we face internationalisation, globalisation and more\r\n\r\ncompetition,  our  education  must  be  more  flexible,  more\r\n\r\ndiversified and with more options available.  Our targets are\r\n\r\nparents  and  students.  Experts have said  that  because  of\r\n\r\nadvancement in telecommunications, Internet and so on, people\r\n\r\nare  becoming more self-centred and their interests are  also\r\n\r\nmore  focused.  I believe Prof Pukumayar has  said  that  the\r\n\r\nsocial  clubs in the future will all be centred  around  very\r\n\r\nlimited  scope  of interest.  There will be a lot  of  focus-groups.  In the case of education, if our educational  system\r\n\r\nis  to be thoroughly reformed, it will eventually evolve into\r\n\r\none  in which students will be selecting only subjects  which\r\n\r\nthey are strong in and according to their personal interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise a few points.

In a report in the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes yesterday, columnist Richard Lim mentioned that in  the\r\n\r\nfuture, a country's wealth will depend not on its size or the\r\n\r\nsize of its population, not on its natural resources, but  on\r\n\r\nhow  you leverage on your advantages, that is, how you  build\r\n\r\nup the intelligence, the knowledge and the potential of every\r\n\r\nindividual  in  the country.  If you have  a  Bill  Gates  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, then at least half of our economic problems  would\r\n\r\nhave been solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the emotional education.\r\n\r\nNowadays, Shanghai is talking about \"one change a day\", not a\r\n\r\nchange   in  10  years  or  a  change  in  20  years.    When\r\n\r\nSingaporeans go to do business in China, we were said  to  be\r\n\r\n\"able to work but unable to behave appropriately\".  There  is\r\n\r\na saying that when Taiwanese go to China to do business, they\r\n\r\npractise  karate or kongshoudao, implying empty-handed.   But\r\n\r\nwhen  Singaporeans  go  to China, we practise  tae-kwando  or\r\n\r\ntaiquandao, implying carry your money there. The  talk  among\r\n\r\nwomen  in  China  is  that the Taiwanese  men  are  wu  qing,\r\n\r\n(heartless), the Hong Kong men are wu yi (ungrateful),  while\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore men are wu zhi (ignorant):  This is of  course\r\n\r\njust  a  joke.  But my personal feeling is that  the  talents\r\n\r\nthat  we produce must not only know how to work but also know\r\n\r\nhow  to  behave appropriately.  We must make some adjustments\r\n\r\nin  this  area so that our educational system will  not  only\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on  training students to  score  high  marks  in\r\n\r\nexaminations, but to build up their character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is emotional education? Emotional education\r\n\r\ninvolves  the appreciation of arts, culture and how  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople,  human  relations, caring and love;  own  strife  for\r\n\r\nbetterment.   We  must  train  our  students  to  learn   and\r\n\r\nappreciate  more  about  the  various  religions,  languages,\r\n\r\nhistory, politics, sociology and philosophy.  To achieve  all\r\n\r\nthese,  we cannot just depend on the teachers alone.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot   fair   to   expect   the  teachers   to   carry   these\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  all  by  themselves.    The   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  should  be  more open-minded  and  draw  from  the\r\n\r\ncollective  wisdom  of people from all  walks  of  life,  the\r\n\r\npoliticians, the businessmen, the parents, etc.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education can also involve other ministries such  as  the\r\n\r\nMCDS,  MOH, MHA to form an inter-Ministry task force to  look\r\n\r\ninto this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, heartware is more important than hardware. When\r\n\r\nwe  are  building  a school, do not go for fanciful  designs,\r\n\r\nsuch  as those fantastically looking roofs, which cost a  lot\r\n\r\nof  money  but not really practical.  Why not save the  money\r\n\r\nand  use  it  to  send the students on overseas  study  tours\r\n\r\ninstead?   The students could learn more by interacting  with\r\n\r\ntheir counterparts in the neighbouring countries and see  for\r\n\r\nthemselves the customs and culture of our neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I met a number of scholarship holders who have\r\n\r\nrecently  returned to Singapore.  I asked them  whether  they\r\n\r\nhad  been to Shanghai.  To my surprise, none of them had been\r\n\r\nto  Shanghai and had shown no interest in going there.   But,\r\n\r\nevery  one of them said that he or she had been to the United\r\n\r\nStates  or  Europe,  and expressed the wish  to  visit  these\r\n\r\nplaces  again.   With the opening up of China  and  the  huge\r\n\r\npotential  in  the  China market, these bright  young  people\r\n\r\nshould  make an attempt to visit China and see for themselves\r\n\r\nhow China has prospered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me go to my main points. There are two aspects\r\n\r\nthat  I  would like to take some time to talk about.  In  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  of  the women's organisation, the participants  were\r\n\r\nvery   concerned  with  our  system  of  streaming  and   the\r\n\r\nphilosophy of teaching according to the children's  potential\r\n\r\nand ability.  When we talk about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteaching  according  to  the  different  abilities   of   the\r\n\r\nstudents,  we  can  implement  modular  system  in   schools.\r\n\r\nBesides  the core subjects such as English, Mathematics,  and\r\n\r\nmother  tongue, the students can opt for subjects at a higher\r\n\r\nlevel.  Outstanding primary students can opt for subjects  at\r\n\r\nthe  Secondary level; outstanding Secondary students can  opt\r\n\r\nfor subjects at the Junior College level or university level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students should be taught according to their\r\n\r\ninterest and ability on these selected subjects.  In addition\r\n\r\nto the core subjects, they can opt for subjects they are good\r\n\r\nat.  But they should not be stigmatised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very proud of our ITE students. But,\r\n\r\nsomething must be done to improve on the image of  ITE.   ITE\r\n\r\nshould be integrated into the mainstream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Education to\r\n\r\nextend  their scope of review to cover pre-school  education,\r\n\r\nalong  with  the  primary,  secondary,  junior  college   and\r\n\r\nuniversity  education.  This is because pre-school  education\r\n\r\nis very important in the building up of a good foundation for\r\n\r\nthe students to advance to the primary school later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to raise is on the SAP\r\n\r\nschools.  I fully support the SAP schools and it is  my  firm\r\n\r\nbelief  that the SAP schools do not affect racial harmony  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, it has been a long\r\n\r\ntime  since the Ministry announced and identified initiatives\r\n\r\nto  promote  creativity  and  thinking  in  schools,  and   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  it was supposed to cut curriculum  down  by\r\n\r\nabout   30%   to  make  way  for  creativity  and  innovation\r\n\r\ndevelopment.    The  key  issue  now  is  that  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nparticularly,  parents, have not felt  the  impact  of  these\r\n\r\nchanges  yet,  because  they  continue  to  be  stressed  and\r\n\r\npressured  by  the children's need to achieve higher  grades,\r\n\r\nand the children, no doubt, continue to be stressed too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with higher grades, but the\r\n\r\nsystem is creating an obsession with grades at this point  of\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support the national objective of promoting\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, I believe the real long-term impact has  to\r\n\r\ncome  from  our education system.  We have many  examples  to\r\n\r\nfollow  from.  The US is a very good example.  In my opinion,\r\n\r\nwe   can  nurture  the  entrepreneurial  spirit  through  our\r\n\r\neducation system in three ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we need to train our students to be not\r\n\r\njust  academically smart, but also street  smart.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  developing both the IQ and the EQ  measures  for  our\r\n\r\nchildren, and we should value each child and value the talent\r\n\r\nof  each  child, and to find ways to groom them so that  they\r\n\r\ncan  excel  in their talent and in their area of interest  so\r\n\r\nthat they can achieve something significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that we really need to create channels and\r\n\r\nexpose  our  children  to  the concept  of  entrepreneurship,\r\n\r\nparticularly  at the secondary school and at ITE,  or  higher\r\n\r\nlevels,  and  I  suggest  that  the  Minister  thinks   about\r\n\r\nimplementing  programmes that teach entrepreneurship  at  the\r\n\r\nCCA  or ECA programmes and just like we do with the uniformed\r\n\r\ngroups  and with societies like the Debating Society, Rotract\r\n\r\nClub, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we need to develop a culture to promote\r\n\r\ntolerance  to failure and giving people more second  chances.\r\n\r\nWe  can  achieve this by fine-tuning some of our policies  as\r\n\r\ntwo  Members before me have spoken.  And, of course,  I  feel\r\n\r\nvery strongly about fine-tuning the streaming system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two specific issues I would like to ask.\r\n\r\nThe  first  one  is  about  the small  cross-section  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety,  and I am talking about the students who are  taking\r\n\r\nthe   minority   Indian  languages,  the   non-Tamil   Indian\r\n\r\nlanguages.   Currently,  students who study  Hindi,  Punjabi,\r\n\r\nGujarati,  Urdu  and Bengali, are not given full  recognition\r\n\r\nfor  their  subject, despite their meeting many requirements.\r\n\r\nI  know  that  the  self-help organisations  responsible  for\r\n\r\nteaching and assessing each of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  languages have put in tremendous effort over the  last\r\n\r\n10  years  to ensure international standards are  met.   They\r\n\r\nhave  gone  through  the  extent of  forming  a  coordinating\r\n\r\ncouncil  among themselves, although they started  separately,\r\n\r\nto   standardise  curriculum,  as  well  as  setting   common\r\n\r\nexaminations  and setting marking standards.  It  is  a  pity\r\n\r\nthat  despite their effort, they have not been given the full\r\n\r\nrecognition of the languages.  I recall a few years  ago  the\r\n\r\nMinister in his reply to a similar question raised the  issue\r\n\r\nof  standards of curriculum, and of results.  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nsituation  has  changed drastically now.   Can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nplease  look  into the issue and advise on  what  else  these\r\n\r\npeople  need to do so that the above languages can have  full\r\n\r\nrecognition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question I would like to ask the Minister on\r\n\r\nthe  system  is on the progress of implementing  Tamil  as  a\r\n\r\nsecond language at a higher level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Singh, you can move on to your next\r\n\r\ncut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the streaming system, in my\r\n\r\nopinion,  is  a  very destructive system, simply  because  it\r\n\r\naffects   the   self-esteem  of  our  children.    We   start\r\n\r\nsegregating  and  labelling them at such  an  early  age.   I\r\n\r\nmentioned   about  how  the  education  system  can   support\r\n\r\ndeveloping the entrepreneur society.  I fully understand  the\r\n\r\nintention  of streaming, and that is to allow each  child  to\r\n\r\ndevelop at his or her own pace, to avoid early drop outs from\r\n\r\nthe education system, by giving an easy curriculum for weaker\r\n\r\nstudents to follow.  Should not our system also focus on  how\r\n\r\nwe  can  try  to make the slower children catch up  with  the\r\n\r\nrest?   Even  if  it  means just a small percentage  of  slow\r\n\r\nlearners who catch up, it will be a huge gain for our  nation\r\n\r\nof such a small population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What special things has the Ministry done to help the\r\n\r\nweaker  children  catch  up?   Has  it  channelled  the  best\r\n\r\nteachers to EM3 classes?  Has it made EM3 classes smaller, so\r\n\r\nthat  there is more attention for the children?  Has it spent\r\n\r\nmore money per child for an EM3 than an EM1 or EM2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclass?   The real answer, in my opinion, is that the Ministry\r\n\r\nand  schools have done the exact opposite.  And,  along  with\r\n\r\nit,  we are labelling our children, first risking creating  a\r\n\r\nclass society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
