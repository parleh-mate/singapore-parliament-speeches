We  conducted  the  initial   public\r\n\r\noffering   of   Singapore  MRT  last   year,   bringing   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  shareholdings  down  from  100%  to  62%.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment   also   divested  Semac  and   Indeco   Engineers\r\n\r\ncompletely in 2000 and 2001 respectively.  Looking ahead, PSA\r\n\r\nCorporation and Singapore Power are slated for listing, while\r\n\r\nthe  three  power generation companies (Power  Seraya,  Power\r\n\r\nSenoko and Tuas Power) will also be divested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to our GLCs' ventures abroad, many have been\r\n\r\nsuccessful.  PSA Corp, for example, has gone as far as China,\r\n\r\nSouth  Korea, Middle East and Europe.  SingTel has footprints\r\n\r\nin  Asia, including Thailand, Taiwan and India.  DBS bank  is\r\n\r\nin Thailand, the Philippines and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some regional ventures, the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nshareholding in GLCs has been an advantage.  It has given the\r\n\r\nGLCs' partners and host governments confidence that this is a\r\n\r\nbona  fide operation with a reputable, long-term shareholder,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  uphold high standards of integrity and  not  cut\r\n\r\ncorners for quick returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not all regional ventures of GLCs have been smooth\r\n\r\nand  successful.  Many companies treat certain industries  as\r\n\r\n\"strategic\"  and fundamental to their national  interest  and\r\n\r\neconomic  development.  But they are cautious about  allowing\r\n\r\nforeign  players to enter or buy into their domestic  market,\r\n\r\nespecially   players  with  significant  foreign   government\r\n\r\nownership.   In  banking, for example,  regulators  typically\r\n\r\napply stringent standards and single shareholding limits.  In\r\n\r\ntelecommunications,    many    countries    limit     foreign\r\n\r\nparticipation in their domestic market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Singapore market has substantial and visible\r\n\r\nshareholdings  in  a company, regulators, political  leaders,\r\n\r\nthe press and local constituents tend to perceive the GLC  to\r\n\r\nbe  Singapore Government-controlled, operating on  an  agenda\r\n\r\nthat   overrides  normal  commercial  considerations.    Such\r\n\r\nperceptions  can  unnecessarily  politicise  and   complicate\r\n\r\nmutually  beneficial commercial deal strategic  alliances  or\r\n\r\nmergers  and  acquisitions.  From time to  time,  GLCs,  like\r\n\r\nSingTel  and  DBS,  have encountered such problems  in  their\r\n\r\nregional ventures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a policy, the Government does not interfere in the\r\n\r\nstrategic  and commercial decisions of GLCs.  All  GLCs  must\r\n\r\noperate  strictly  commercially, and are  expected  to  yield\r\n\r\nproper economic returns.  They are supervised by their boards\r\n\r\nof  directors  and  accountable to  all  their  shareholders,\r\n\r\nincluding the non-government shareholders who often  own  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if these perceptions exist, we need to address\r\n\r\nthe  issue.   In  many  industries,  the  scale  of  economic\r\n\r\nactivity is increasingly global.  To be competitive and  have\r\n\r\ngrowth   prospects,  companies  need  to  transcend  national\r\n\r\nboundaries,  especially  in a small economy  like  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  recent  wave of mergers and acquisitions in  industries,\r\n\r\nlike banking and telecommunications, reflects this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has stated that its shareholdings in GLCs\r\n\r\nare  not sacrosanct.  With very few exceptions, GLCs  are  in\r\n\r\nplay,  free  to  acquire or be acquired  in  accordance  with\r\n\r\ncommercial  dictates.   If anybody wants  to  bid  for  them,\r\n\r\nwhether  the  bidder is foreign or Singaporean,  friendly  or\r\n\r\nhostile,  we  will  consider the proposition  seriously.   We\r\n\r\ncannot afford to take a parochial, xenophobic approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies, like SingTel and DBS, are large players in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   but  small  by  world  standards.    To   become\r\n\r\nsignificant players, they must, over time, evolve  into  more\r\n\r\nthan  Singapore  companies.   This  is  why  we  have  lifted\r\n\r\nrequirement for banks and telecommunication companies  to  be\r\n\r\nmajority Singapore-owned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government presently owns 78% of SingTel, and 37% of\r\n\r\nDBS.   We  do  not regard these as strategic  stakes,  to  be\r\n\r\npermanently   maintained.   We   are   prepared   to   reduce\r\n\r\nsignificantly our shareholdings in SingTel and DBS  over  the\r\n\r\nmedium  term.   How  this  should be  done  will  be  studied\r\n\r\nfurther.   It  can  be by dilution through a merger,  private\r\n\r\nsale   to   institutional  investors,  a   SOTUS-type   asset\r\n\r\nenhancement exercise for citizens, or some other means.   Any\r\n\r\ndivestment  should naturally take place at the  right  price,\r\n\r\nand under the right market conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For SingTel, we will remove the \"special share\" which\r\n\r\ngives the Government the right to veto major decisions in the\r\n\r\ncompany.   Instead, we will meet our national security  needs\r\n\r\nthrough appropriate safeguards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For DBS, we will need to ensure that the Singapore\r\n\r\ncharacter  of the bank is preserved, following any divestment\r\n\r\nby  the Government.  It is important that we will be able  to\r\n\r\nrely  on the local banks to keep Singapore's financial system\r\n\r\non  an  even  keel  in  a crisis.  The Banking  Act  and  MAS\r\n\r\nRegulations help to ensure that the local banks retain  their\r\n\r\ncommitment to Singapore, even if they form strategic linkages\r\n\r\nor merge with foreign partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, MAS approval is required before single\r\n\r\nshareholdings can exceed three threshold levels, 5%, 12%  and\r\n\r\n20%.   Second,  MAS requires at least half of  the  board  of\r\n\r\ndirectors  of  the  bank  to comprise Singapore  citizens  or\r\n\r\npermanent residents.  This specific requirement may  need  to\r\n\r\nbe  modified, for example, in a merger with another party  of\r\n\r\ncomparable size, which is able to contribute to the bank  and\r\n\r\nits  continued growth and commitment to Singapore.  But  even\r\n\r\nin such a situation, MAS will continue to ensure a strong and\r\n\r\nmeaningful  Singaporean presence on the board of  the  merged\r\n\r\nentity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this statement of our intentions will dispel\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  misapprehensions  about  the  nature  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  shareholdings in GLCs, and give  them  a  freer\r\n\r\nhand to pursue M&A deals with prospective parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Deputy Prime Minister two supplementary  questions.\r\n\r\nThe  first is that, with regard to the report in the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes that the Department of Statistics is doing a review  of\r\n\r\nthe  scope  and  range  of  GLCs, whether  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is aware of this study and whether this study  will\r\n\r\nbe  coming  up  soon.  It was mentioned in the Straits  Times\r\n\r\nrecently.   I  am not aware of this until I read  it  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times myself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether there is a need to do\r\n\r\nanother review of the role of GLCs.  I recall that the  first\r\n\r\nreview   was  done  more  than  five  years  ago.    A   very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive review was done.  Could the review be conducted\r\n\r\nby  a  joint  committee from both private and  public  sector\r\n\r\nrepresentatives since this committee can actually  look  into\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  of  the  GLCs,  how  their  strengths  can  be\r\n\r\nexploited,  areas  of cooperation between  GLCs  and  private\r\n\r\nsector  as  well as to give guidelines on how GLCs can  avoid\r\n\r\nfuture encroachment in the private sector and, finally, maybe\r\n\r\neven  ask the committee to hear complaints, if any, of  GLCs'\r\n\r\nunfair competition versus the private sector?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Mr Leong\r\n\r\nis  referring  to a study recently done by the Department  of\r\n\r\nStatistics which was aimed at determining what proportion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore GDP was accounted by GLCs.  There was  a  time\r\n\r\ninflated number of 60% to something originally.  And DOS  re-estimated  this and came out with some number  of  less  than\r\n\r\n20%.  I think it was 13% ---\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 12%\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> 12%.

It is not ongoing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On review of the role of the GLCs, this is something\r\n\r\nwhich   we   have   continued  to  do.    It   is   Temasek's\r\n\r\nresponsibility and the Ministry of Finance oversees this.  As\r\n\r\nwe  have explained, in nearly every case, GLC's function  has\r\n\r\nto be to operate as a commercial entity.  There are cases\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are  social  considerations  as  well  as   the\r\n\r\nDBS/POSBank  which we have discussed extensively.   But  even\r\n\r\nwith  that,  DBS  still should have a free  hand  to  operate\r\n\r\nwithout being subject to undue impositions.  As long as  they\r\n\r\nare  operating  completely  freely  and  without  any  hidden\r\n\r\nGovernment assistance or subsidy, they should be free  to  do\r\n\r\ntheir  business  as  they think fit.  I do  not  think  there\r\n\r\nshould  be areas where we push them to go and I do not  think\r\n\r\nthere  should be areas where we prevent them from  going.   I\r\n\r\nknow  that, every now and then, the newspapers will come  out\r\n\r\nwith  the  story  of  a GLC which went into  the  roast  duck\r\n\r\nbusiness.   I  believe the GLC subsequently  sold  the  roast\r\n\r\nducks  and  the  business, but that has  not  been  regularly\r\n\r\nhighlighted in the newspapers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not our business to micro manage. They have\r\n\r\ntheir  business.  They know what their focus is meant to  be.\r\n\r\nIf  they  are not properly focused, the shareholders will  do\r\n\r\nsomething  about  it.   In most cases, the shareholders  will\r\n\r\ninclude minority non-Government shareholders, in some  cases,\r\n\r\nit  is  fully owned.

In most cases,  we\r\n\r\nare  open, and if there is a buyer available who makes us  an\r\n\r\nattractive offer, we will be happy to transact.  And in  many\r\n\r\ncases, over a period of time, we would be happy to reduce our\r\n\r\nshareholdings down below where they are now and,  maybe  even\r\n\r\ndivest  completely.

Mr Ang Mong Seng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  very  concerned  about  the  competition  and\r\n\r\nchallenges faced by the HDB neighbourhood retailers, and  has\r\n\r\nestablished  the Retail 21 Development Plan to help  them  to\r\n\r\nupgrade and develop their business. A sum of $16 million  has\r\n\r\nbeen allocated for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of how these neighbourhood retailers\r\n\r\ncould upgrade their management and break out of the difficult\r\n\r\nsituation, may I make the following observations:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Change in shopping behaviour. In the past, when\r\n\r\npeople went shopping, they would have some specific needs  in\r\n\r\nmind.   For  example,  Minister Mah  mentioned  that  in  his\r\n\r\nyounger days, when he went to the provision shop to make  his\r\n\r\npurchase, he would already have in mind certain goods to buy,\r\n\r\neg,  sugar, oil, etc. However, with the changes in  time  and\r\n\r\nlifestyles,  people  nowadays enjoy  going  to  the  shopping\r\n\r\ncentres  just  to  look around, without  having  anything  in\r\n\r\nparticular that they would like to buy.  If a certain display\r\n\r\nat the window attracts the shopper, he would go into the shop\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexamine  it before buying.  On the other hand, if  the  goods\r\n\r\nare  displayed in a haphazard manner, they will  not  attract\r\n\r\nthe   young  shoppers.   Furthermore,  in  the  old-fashioned\r\n\r\nprovision  shops where the goods are stacked  up  disorderly,\r\n\r\nsome dishonest customers may take away certain goods and walk\r\n\r\nout  of the shops without paying for them. The shopkeeper may\r\n\r\nnot even notice it.  Therefore, these neighbourhood retailers\r\n\r\ncan learn a thing or two from the 7-Eleven stores where there\r\n\r\nare always a good product mix and the goods are displayed  in\r\n\r\nan orderly and attractive manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Changes in shopping environment. One reason why\r\n\r\nshopping  centres could attract the crowd is the  comfortable\r\n\r\nand   spacious  environment.   Neighbourhood  retailers   can\r\n\r\nattract  shoppers  by  improving  the  surroundings  of   the\r\n\r\nshopping areas.  Chong Pang Town and Hong Kah Plaza are  good\r\n\r\nexamples  of how retailers got together and worked  with  the\r\n\r\nTown  Council  to  improve the shop facades and  the  general\r\n\r\nsurroundings,   thereby  making  them   move   spacious   and\r\n\r\nattractive.   The Gombak Town project which is underway  will\r\n\r\nbe yet another example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Changes in rental. At present, all shops, whether\r\n\r\nlocated  in  the  residential blocks, neighbourhood  or  town\r\n\r\ncentres,  are  charged market rental  rates.   How  does  HDB\r\n\r\ndetermine  the  market  rents?   These  rents  are   computed\r\n\r\naccording to the 6-month tender price of the shops.  However,\r\n\r\ntwo things happen when shops are tendered:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The \"kiasu\" tender where the bid is extremely high,\r\n\r\nfor fear of failure to secure the place; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The \"kiasi\" or \"afraid to die\" tender where the bid\r\n\r\nis  very low for fear that the capital cannot be recouped and\r\n\r\nthe business will die.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of these should be used as a benchmark for\r\n\r\ndetermining   market   rate  rental.    A   more   reasonable\r\n\r\ncomputation  would  be  the highest tender  rental  plus  the\r\n\r\nlowest  tender  rental, divided by two, eg, $3,000  +  $1,000\r\n\r\ndivided by two, giving\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  rental  of  $2,000,  which is more reasonable.   But  this\r\n\r\nmarket  rent  should be charged only on  shops  in  the  town\r\n\r\ncentres  selling  consumer  and  expensive  goods,  such   as\r\n\r\nwatches,  jewellery and cosmetics.  I am sure Mr  Speaker  is\r\n\r\nvery  familiar with the watch trade.  A watch which  is  sold\r\n\r\nfor  $1,000  can  bring  the shop owner  a  profit  of  $100.\r\n\r\nHowever, in a sundry shop, a bottle of soya sauce is sold  at\r\n\r\n$1  and  the profit is only 10 cents.  Therefore, rental  for\r\n\r\nshops in residential blocks or in the neighbourhood should be\r\n\r\nbenchmarked according to the type of residents living in  the\r\n\r\narea.   They  should be charged a reasonable rental  rate  to\r\n\r\nhelp  lower their business costs, so that they can  carry  on\r\n\r\nwith their business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Government buy-back package. Some ageing\r\n\r\nshopkeepers are finding it difficult to continue  with  their\r\n\r\nbusiness.   They  could have been doing the business  from  a\r\n\r\ntender  age  and stuck with it until a ripe  old  age.   They\r\n\r\ncannot  carry  on  with  their business.   According  to  the\r\n\r\npresent  HDB regulations, those who want to return the  shops\r\n\r\nto  the HDB cannot get any compensation.  They would have  to\r\n\r\nfork  out  some  money  to refurbish the  shops  before  such\r\n\r\npremises  are returned to the HDB.  When the shopkeepers  are\r\n\r\nold, there is no one to take over.  Therefore, can HDB change\r\n\r\nthis  rule?    It  should  render a  helping  hand  to  these\r\n\r\nshopkeepers.  HDB should consider allowing them to return the\r\n\r\nshops and pay them a sum of, say, $48,000 as compensation, as\r\n\r\nis  the  practice  under the Selective En-Bloc  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nScheme (SERS).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the shopkeepers, trade associations and HDB would\r\n\r\nconsider the above suggestions.  I believe retailers  in  the\r\n\r\nHDB still have good prospects.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the poor\r\n\r\nbusiness  of HDB neighbourhood shops is a problem  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  in  existence for a long time.  Part of the  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  their trades, as specified by the HDB, are not relevant\r\n\r\nto the demands of the market in the present day\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand the shopowners are not allowed to change their trade.  As\r\n\r\nsuch, they just had to carry on doing their business in  very\r\n\r\ndifficult circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the solutions to this problem are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Greater flexibility on the part of the HDB to allow the\r\n\r\nshopowners or tenants to change their trades;  and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Permission by the Urban Redevelopment Authority to allow\r\n\r\nthose neighbourhood shops in the out-of-the-way localities to\r\n\r\nchange the use of their shops.  In places where there are too\r\n\r\nmany  shops, resulting in many shops being left vacant, URA\r\n\r\nshould allow them to be used for other activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any estate, the HDB specifies what trade the shops\r\n\r\nshould  be  engaged in.  It is, of course,  good  to  have  a\r\n\r\nproper  trade  mix,  for the convenience  of  the  residents.\r\n\r\nHowever,  when  the  convenience  shops,  like  7-Eleven  and\r\n\r\nCheers,   come   into  the  neighbourhood,  the   traditional\r\n\r\nprovision  shops could not compete with them.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  HDB does not allow the provision shops to  change\r\n\r\ntheir  trade,  so they have to just carry on  with  the  same\r\n\r\ntrade,  even when there is no longer any demand  for  such  a\r\n\r\ntrade. So, to solve this problem, the HDB should have greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  allow the shopowners and tenants  to  change\r\n\r\ntheir  trade and let market conditions decide the  number  of\r\n\r\nvarious types of business in the neighbourhood shops. The HDB\r\n\r\nshould  also help those who cannot carry on, eg,  the  ageing\r\n\r\nshopowners,  and let them exit by giving them  some  form  of\r\n\r\ncompensation.  Only then can the shops in the HDB estates  be\r\n\r\nre-packaged  to  serve the residents under a  new  and  fresh\r\n\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to talk about change of use. URA\r\n\r\nspecifies  that the neighbourhood shops in HDB estates  could\r\n\r\nonly  be used for retail business and not for other purposes.\r\n\r\nThis  is  understandable.  However,  in  some  out-of-the-way\r\n\r\nlocalities, there are too many shops, resulting in a surplus,\r\n\r\nand  many of the shops could not attract tenants and they are\r\n\r\nclosed throughout the year.  If URA could permit these  shops\r\n\r\nto change\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  use and allow the tenants to use them as showrooms  or\r\n\r\noffices,  then  at least these shops could be fully  utilised\r\n\r\nand it could also bring more life to the housing estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already allowed those who are\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the  Internet-driven  companies  to  use  their\r\n\r\nresidence  as an office.  Why is it that we cannot allow  the\r\n\r\nvacant  shops to be converted to offices and allow the start-up  companies to start their business at a lower rent to  cut\r\n\r\ntheir overhead expenses?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another related question is the request of the residents\r\n\r\nto  convert the upper floor of the shops for other  purposes.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the original design, the upper  floor  of  the\r\n\r\nshops was meant for the shopowners and their families to stay\r\n\r\nin. By staying on the upper floor, the shopowners will enjoy\r\n\r\ngreat convenience in looking after their business downstairs.\r\n\r\nThis was a good conception, but this was 20 years ago.  Now,\r\n\r\nwith the changes of time, most of the shopowners have  their\r\n\r\nown flats elsewhere and they use the premises  upstairs  as\r\n\r\nwarehouse or offices. According to the rules,  they  would\r\n\r\nhave to apply to the URA for change of use and, very  often,\r\n\r\nit would be very difficult for them to get the approval.  My\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, mentioned  during\r\n\r\nthe debate on MTI's budget, that the owners  of  the  shops\r\n\r\nalong Upper Thomson Road applied to convert the second storey\r\n\r\nof their shops into offices or other commercial purposes, but\r\n\r\ntheir  applications were refused and the reason was  that  it\r\n\r\nwould cause traffic congestion.  As for HDB, they refused  to\r\n\r\nallow  the  shopowners  to convert the  upper  floor  into  a\r\n\r\nwarehouse  because  the  floor  was  not  strong  enough   to\r\n\r\nwithstand  the extra weight of the goods to be stored  there.\r\n\r\nSo,  using  the upper floor for storage would pose  problems.\r\n\r\nBut  if  there  are people just working there as  an  office,\r\n\r\nwould there be additional weight as compared to people living\r\n\r\nthere?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that URA could reconsider these applications for\r\n\r\nconversion   of   use   and   give  them   more   sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration.   In fact, URA has approved  applications  for\r\n\r\nthe change of use by some of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthese premises.  However, the approval is valid only for  one\r\n\r\nyear.  So if they want to carry on using the premises for the\r\n\r\nchanged   purpose,   they  would  have  to   resubmit   their\r\n\r\napplication every year.  This is time and energy wasting.  As\r\n\r\na  result,  the shopowners would not dare to spend  money  on\r\n\r\nrenovation, because of the uncertainties.  So we should allow\r\n\r\nthem to convert the upper floors into offices.  This will put\r\n\r\nthe  premises  to optimum use and allow the  owners  to  save\r\n\r\ntheir  business cost so as to cope with the uncertainties  in\r\n\r\nthe next couple of years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to inform hon. Members that\r\n\r\nthe \"guillotine\" time for this discussion is 3.00 pm.  Dr Tan\r\n\r\nBoon Wan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, our neighbourhood\r\n\r\nretailers   face  difficulties.   I  join  my   parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in  expressing  our  concern,  and  to  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to help them.  I support many of the  suggestions\r\n\r\nmade by my colleagues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no business can survive if the customers do not\r\n\r\nsupport  them  and do not need their products  and  services.\r\n\r\nThe  issues  of  the  management  of  the  shops,  and  their\r\n\r\nrelevance  to  the  community, impinge upon  their  long-term\r\n\r\nviability.   They  need  help  with  these  issues.   But  to\r\n\r\novercome  their difficulties, they must want to change;  they\r\n\r\ncan  help  themselves.  Today, in many neighbourhood centres,\r\n\r\nretailers  have come together to form merchants  or  business\r\n\r\nassociations. To help themselves, they can carry  out  market\r\n\r\nsurveys to determine the needs of the communities they serve.\r\n\r\nThey  can  get consultants to advise them.  They can organise\r\n\r\ncourses to upgrade their management skills and the skills  of\r\n\r\ntheir  workers.  They can also organise visits to learn  from\r\n\r\nsuccessful shopping centres.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recently unveiled a slew of supports\r\n\r\nunder  Retailers 21.  I am confident that it will go  a  long\r\n\r\nway  to assist retailers.  However, if retailers want to help\r\n\r\nthemselves, I hope that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Government would consider making available this support,\r\n\r\nboth funds and expertise, to the neighbourhood merchants  and\r\n\r\nbusiness  associations.  If this is possible, this help  will\r\n\r\nbe  brought  closer home.  The help can then be  specifically\r\n\r\ntailored  to the needs of each neigbourhood shopping  centre.\r\n\r\nBy  being  directly involved, the retailers  will  be  better\r\n\r\nmotivated   with  a  sense  of  ownership  of   the   support\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  Training will be more accessible and  convenient\r\n\r\nto the retailers and their workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also want to make an appeal to our landlords.\r\n\r\nHDB  has  sold many of the neighbourhood shops.  Many  owners\r\n\r\nhave  rented  out these shops. I have seen shops  that  enjoy\r\n\r\ngood  business fold.  A common refrain is that landlords have\r\n\r\nincreased  the rent.  There is nothing left for  the  tenants\r\n\r\nafter  that.   Landlords should charge a fair  market  rental\r\n\r\nthat  reflects  a  reasonable return  on  their  investments.\r\n\r\nReasonable  rental  means reasonable cost.   This  translates\r\n\r\ninto lower prices for the customers.  Everyone benefits.  The\r\n\r\nlandlord  gets  a  good steady rental, the retailer  makes  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory return for his hard work and the residents enjoy\r\n\r\nfair  prices and good service.  Hence, I urge our  landlords:\r\n\r\nplease do not raise the rent just because your tenants  enjoy\r\n\r\ngood business.  Tenants go into business to make money.  They\r\n\r\nwork  hard  for their profit.  It does not motivate  them  to\r\n\r\nwork  if  the fruits of their efforts are being creamed  off.\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood retailers bring convenience and needed services\r\n\r\nand  products  to the community.  We should  help  to  ensure\r\n\r\ntheir continued viability and presence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I understand that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  stopped the sale of HDB shops.  In my experience, I  see\r\n\r\nseveral plus points for this programme to continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, I spoke against the sale of HDB shops on\r\n\r\n99-year  lease  and I called for a change in  the  policy  of\r\n\r\nselling HDB shops instead on 30-year lease, which is in  line\r\n\r\nwith industrial properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe then Minister for National Development, Mr Lim Hng Kiang,\r\n\r\naccepted  this suggestion, and except for a small  number  of\r\n\r\nunits,  all  the shops in my constituency were  sold  to  the\r\n\r\nsitting  tenants  on a 30-year lease.  This was  sometime  in\r\n\r\nlate 1995 and early 1996.  There was resistance from a number\r\n\r\nof  shop  tenants for various reasons.  It was not a  popular\r\n\r\nidea  at  that  time.   Most of them see shopowners  in  town\r\n\r\ncentres buying shops and making huge profits out of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advent of the Asian currency crisis in July 1997 and\r\n\r\nthe  recession  that followed after, made all  my  shopowners\r\n\r\ntoday  thankful that the decision they made was a right  one.\r\n\r\nAlmost  all of the shopowners rented out half of their shops.\r\n\r\nThis  rent  which they receive is sufficient to pay  for  the\r\n\r\nmortgage  and, in some cases, turn in a surplus.  This  means\r\n\r\nthat  the  shopowners can continue to operate a smaller  unit\r\n\r\nand  continue their business.  In other words, the  shopowner\r\n\r\nhas  his mortgage paid by someone else and, at the same time,\r\n\r\ncan  continue his livelihood.  Today, I believe my shopowners\r\n\r\nin  my  constituency  are  a much satisfied  and  financially\r\n\r\nhealthy lot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I strongly urge the Government to continue the\r\n\r\nsale of HDB shop programme as this is one avenue to alleviate\r\n\r\nthe   hardships   and   difficulties  of  our   neighbourhood\r\n\r\nshopkeepers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\njoin  in Mr Chng Hee Kok's call for the Government to  resume\r\n\r\nthe  sale  of HDB shop scheme because, since the  last  sale,\r\n\r\nthere has been no further activity in this particular scheme.\r\n\r\nHDB  has  also not announced when it would resume the scheme,\r\n\r\nnor  indicate  whether  it  has been   cancelled  altogether.\r\n\r\nThere   are,  in  fact,  many  neighbourhood  centres   whose\r\n\r\noperators  are still waiting to participate in  the  sale  of\r\n\r\nshops  scheme, on the assumption that the sale  prices  would\r\n\r\nalways be pegged at a discount to the market price.  This was\r\n\r\nso  when the market was on the way up, and should be so  when\r\n\r\nthe  market  is  on the way down.  One of these neighbourhood\r\n\r\ncentres is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  my constituency at Clementi Street 13 in Bukit Timah GRC.\r\n\r\nTheir desire has been highlighted in the press recently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all businesses were negatively affected by the\r\n\r\nscheme.  Some of the more vibrant ones would like the  scheme\r\n\r\nto  continue.   If  HDB  were to continue  to  do  so,  those\r\n\r\ncurrently  settled  down  will  find  their  assets   further\r\n\r\ndepressed if HDB were to sell the shops at the current market\r\n\r\nprice.  In a way, I can understand why HDB is silent on  this\r\n\r\nmatter because no matter what it does, it can please no  one.\r\n\r\nIf  HDB were to suspend the scheme, it would be equivalent to\r\n\r\ndenying  the  opportunity to those who are still waiting  for\r\n\r\nthe  privilege  granted to many others, including  the  early\r\n\r\nbatches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister not to leave everyone waiting\r\n\r\nfor  the  scheme  in  limbo and to  state  very  clearly  and\r\n\r\nexplicitly whether the scheme will be continued or suspended.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the HDB Main and\r\n\r\nInterim Upgrading Programmes have received much support  from\r\n\r\nmany   HDB   residents.    The  upgrading   programmes   have\r\n\r\nrevitalised our older housing estates and, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nkept   our   communities  together.  The  success  of   these\r\n\r\nprogrammes has spurred a lot of interest among HDB residents.\r\n\r\nMany  are  now requesting for their flats to be upgraded.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  suggest the following for  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Revised MUP and IUP cut-off dates. Due to the age\r\n\r\ncriterion, and the cut-off dates set by HDB, many  blocks  of\r\n\r\nflats  are  not eligible for upgrading.  I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\ncan consider revising the cut-off dates of flats so that more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can benefit from the upgrading programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Lift upgrading programme. Last year, I requested\r\n\r\nfor  a special lift-upgrading programme.  I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwill consider implementing a Special Lift Upgrading Programme\r\n\r\nto  expedite the installation of lifts on every  floor.   Our\r\n\r\nfast  ageing society has created an immediate demand for such\r\n\r\nadded services in a high-rise public housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Design rectification. Many old HDB flats have\r\n\r\ndesign  features  which  encourage  mosquito  breeding,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  bamboo  pole holders, concealed  drains,  canopies,\r\n\r\nmetal  decking roofs, etc.  These design features are  costly\r\n\r\nto  rectify  to prevent mosquito breeding.   The  Environment\r\n\r\nMinistry has been working closely with the town councils  and\r\n\r\nHDB  to  resolve such problems.  But the lack of funding  has\r\n\r\nslowed  down  the efforts, leading to frequent  outbreaks  of\r\n\r\ndengue  fever.  To  address this problem, I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider implementing a one-time goodwill  repair\r\n\r\nprogramme for these flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nHDB's  Interim  Upgrading Programme and  the  Main  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme  have indeed benefited many Singaporean  households\r\n\r\nliving  in  the  public estates.  Many are anxiously  looking\r\n\r\nforward for their turn to have this upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask what is the status of these\r\n\r\nupgrading  programmes so far, in terms of how many  precincts\r\n\r\nhave  already  undergone Interim Upgrading Programme  or  the\r\n\r\nMain Upgrading Programme.  Also, I would like to ask how many\r\n\r\nmore  precincts are left, based on the revised criteria which\r\n\r\nwould go through the IUP and MUP. In recent times, in the new\r\n\r\nannouncements  of precincts for MUP, I notice  that  in  some\r\n\r\nprecincts,  for instance, in my constituency, there  are  two\r\n\r\npoint  blocks which are considered for MUP, while  there  are\r\n\r\nfive  or six blocks in the same precinct.   By just selecting\r\n\r\ntwo  point  blocks, for instance, does not give the economies\r\n\r\nof scale. Secondly, it also makes it very difficult for us to\r\n\r\nexplain  to  the  residents of the other  blocks  within  the\r\n\r\nprecinct  as to why they are not selected for the  upgrading.\r\n\r\nIf  there are other plans like SERS or things like that, this\r\n\r\nshould  also  be announced simultaneously so that unnecessary\r\n\r\nrumour-mongering can be prevented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on the lift upgrading programme, as\r\n\r\nDr Teo has just mentioned.  Many residents find that, whether\r\n\r\nit is the IUP or MUP, lift upgrading has the most\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimpact on these programmes.  We find, especially in the older\r\n\r\nestates,  like  in the city centre, Kim Seng,  Kampong  Glam,\r\n\r\nMoulmein,  and even in Toa Payoh, many residents  are  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens and they look forward to the MUP, but it takes  some\r\n\r\ntime.   Therefore,  you find that the town councils  are  not\r\n\r\nable  to provide lift landing on every floor because  of  the\r\n\r\ncost.   I  would  also like to ask that this  lift  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme,  on a pilot scheme that has been planned,  can  be\r\n\r\nexpanded  and more of the mature estates in the  city  centre\r\n\r\ncan be considered for this upgrading.  It is possible to farm\r\n\r\nit  out  for the town councils to manage this project because\r\n\r\nthis  can be done within a year or so, as opposed to  waiting\r\n\r\nfor  a  MUP which takes a long time. At the same time,  there\r\n\r\nare many in mature estates which have gone through IUP in the\r\n\r\nfirst  phase,  but they did not get their lift upgrading.   I\r\n\r\nhope  that this scheme can be introduced for them as  quickly\r\n\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, unlike Dr Teo Ho Pin, I would\r\n\r\nurge  the  Government to make a total review of the  IUP  and\r\n\r\nMUP. The reason is because of the recommendations encompassed\r\n\r\nin  Concept  Plan  21  where the land  use  review  envisions\r\n\r\nSingapore with a population of 5.5 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on current land utilisation ratio, there is a\r\n\r\npotential  shortfall of 4,000 hectares of  land.   The  focus\r\n\r\ngroup  on land allocation, in its report, called for a higher\r\n\r\nplot  ratio  in  general.  In high density  private  and  HDB\r\n\r\nestates, the focus group urges that the GPR be increased from\r\n\r\n2.5 to 3.65.  The reason I call for a review is that there is\r\n\r\nlimitation with the IUP and MUP.  As no new additional  units\r\n\r\nwill  be  built in those estates, existing residents have  to\r\n\r\nmove  out before new residents could move in. Thus, there  is\r\n\r\nalways a shortage of younger and more energetic residents  to\r\n\r\nrejuvenate  the  older housing estates.  IUP is,  of  course,\r\n\r\nalways welcome by the residents as the improvements are  free\r\n\r\nto  them.   But  MUP  requires co-payment by  the  residents.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  during the construction period, those  affected\r\n\r\nhave to live in the midst of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  great  construction site.  Most of those  who  have  lived\r\n\r\nthrough  it  would  not  recommend it to  their  friend,  but\r\n\r\nperhaps to their enemy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the falling of HDB prices in the resale market, it\r\n\r\nseems  to  me that MUP is losing its appeal to the  residents\r\n\r\nnowadays.   As  I  said, the MUP and IUP do  not  change  the\r\n\r\nlandscape  in line with our future scenarios.  The  Minister,\r\n\r\nin his reply yesterday, has already agreed that higher GPR in\r\n\r\nexisting  HDB  estates  would  be  more  cost-effective,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, if we were to include the infrastructure cost  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  new towns.  If we are planning for a population  of\r\n\r\n5.5  million, would it not be more cost-effective  to  pursue\r\n\r\nalternative  schemes like SERS with immediate  effect,  where\r\n\r\npossible?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, when you speak to\r\n\r\nyoung  couples who have applied for new HDB flats,  you  will\r\n\r\nhear  complaints  that they continue to face difficulties  in\r\n\r\nmeeting  the  downpayment, even with the present arrangements\r\n\r\nof  two  instalment payments of 10% each.  To make it  easier\r\n\r\nfor  them, could the Minister reduce the downpayment  to  10%\r\n\r\nand  in  two  instalments?  This will encourage them  to  get\r\n\r\naccess  to  housing  much  earlier and  that  would  also  be\r\n\r\nenhancing  our  family policy of more than two  children,  if\r\n\r\nthey can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to young couples who want to live near to their\r\n\r\nparents in mature estates, we have encouraged them to do  so.\r\n\r\nYet, we are not making it easier for them.  It should not  be\r\n\r\nseen  as a lip service to them.  It is important to find ways\r\n\r\nto enhance the capacity to live near their parents.  The cash\r\n\r\nupfront  and  downpayment  are major  hindrances.  Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister consider reducing the downpayment to 10% and provide\r\n\r\nan  additional housing loan to enable young couples  to  meet\r\n\r\nsome part of the cash upfront payment?  That seems to be  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of young couples who want to live near  parents  in\r\n\r\nmature estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the HDB has ceased the building\r\n\r\nof 3-room flats and smaller units.  It has stopped the build-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ning  of  executive  apartments. It has established  a  fairly\r\n\r\nsuccessful  partial privatisation of its  activities  in  the\r\n\r\ndesign  and  build  scheme.  There is no  question  that  the\r\n\r\nExecutive Condominium scheme has taken off very nicely.  This\r\n\r\nleads  me  to  revive  a suggestion I  made  before  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber.   I  suggested about five years ago that HDB  should\r\n\r\nstop  building  large  flats and leave this  to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.  I suggested that there was no reason for HDB  to  go\r\n\r\nbeyond  providing  basic  housing  and  should  restrict   to\r\n\r\nbuilding 4-room flats and smaller units.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today, with the slowdown in demand for new\r\n\r\nflats  to  no more than 10,000 units a year, and unlikely  to\r\n\r\nrise  as a result of demographic changes, there is compelling\r\n\r\nreason  today for the HDB to privatise the building of  flats\r\n\r\naltogether.  The  design-and-build scheme and  the  Executive\r\n\r\nCondominium scheme should be able to take care of the  annual\r\n\r\nneeds of the demand for public housing.  This move is similar\r\n\r\nto  the devolution of the maintenance role of the HDB to  the\r\n\r\ntown councils.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these changes, the continuing role of the HDB\r\n\r\nshould  be in setting policy, planning and upgrading  of  old\r\n\r\nestates.  This move of leaving the building of flats  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate   sector  altogether  will  strengthen  the  building\r\n\r\nindustry, give consumers a wider choice of public housing and\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  need not have an organisation when the  demand  for\r\n\r\npublic  housing  drops.  Will the Minister highlight  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse whether there is a review of the role of the HDB  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of this shifting of demand?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I spoke of the continuing role of HDB in the\r\n\r\nupgrading of old estates.  About five years ago, I  spoke  of\r\n\r\nthe  need  to launch a lift upgrading programme to complement\r\n\r\nthe  Main Upgrading Programme (MUP) and the Interim Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme (IUP).  The Government turned down the suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three weeks ago, I conducted a survey at an exhibition\r\n\r\nof an area in my constituency chosen for the Main Upgrading\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nProgramme.  Almost to the last resident, there were questions\r\n\r\nand requests made for the upgrading of lifts to stop on every\r\n\r\nfloor.  Unfortunately, in the Main Upgrading Programme,  this\r\n\r\nitem is to be entertained only when there are funds left over\r\n\r\nafter  the  tender exercise for the MUP.  A small  number  of\r\n\r\nresidents even said that they were not in favour of  the  MUP\r\n\r\nif the lifts were not upgraded.  One even asked why we do not\r\n\r\ndemolish  the flats altogether and do a SERS.  MUP  was  much\r\n\r\nsought after at one time, but I do not know for how long.   I\r\n\r\nhope  that this is not a sign of escalating expectations that\r\n\r\none day we cannot meet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the MUP, these flats, which were meant\r\n\r\nfor  main  upgrading,  were built 23 years ago.  The emphasis\r\n\r\nthen  was  on  the  speed of supply of public  housing.   The\r\n\r\npopulation was also younger and more robust then.   This  has\r\n\r\nchanged, and my recent experience tells me that next  to  the\r\n\r\nMUP,  a lift upgrading programme (LUP) will certainly be  not\r\n\r\nonly  popular  but, I believe, much needed.  I  am  confident\r\n\r\nthat  the area I spoke about is similar in character to  many\r\n\r\nother  parts of Singapore.  Will the Minister heed  the  call\r\n\r\nthis time, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, we must review the registration for\r\n\r\nflat  policy  to  be more pro-family and to better  meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds of Singaporeans.  I would like to suggest the following\r\n\r\nproposals for the Minister to consider:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Build on demand flats. HDB can adopt a similar\r\n\r\napproach,  as  adopted by private developers to  build  flats\r\n\r\nbased  on demand of the population.  Selected sites of  about\r\n\r\n500-700  units  can  be  chosen for development  at  specific\r\n\r\nlocations.  Singaporeans can then be invited to select  these\r\n\r\nflats based on specific location.  If there is no demand  for\r\n\r\na   specific  location,  HDB  will  not  proceed   with   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  and  an alternative site will  be  sought.   In\r\n\r\ncases  where the take-up rate may not be 100%, the  remaining\r\n\r\nflats  can  be  rented out to families who need  transitional\r\n\r\nhousing  such  as  bankrupts, widows, retirees,  singles  and\r\n\r\nyoung married couples.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Reclassification of zones. Can HDB consider\r\n\r\nreclassifying its zoning system?  Many flat applicants  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  choose flats by specific location such as  town  or\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Master listing of available flats. Can HDB\r\n\r\nconsider   consolidating  a  master  listing  of  all   flats\r\n\r\navailable, so that flat applicants can have more choices  for\r\n\r\na flat?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I have a\r\n\r\nspecific  cut on lift upgrading, but I find that many  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have  already spoken on this.  And  following  in\r\n\r\ntheir  wake,  I  would  like to join in  the  call  for  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On lift upgrading, I want to emphasise that we are not\r\n\r\njust  talking about installing new and faster lifts.  By lift\r\n\r\nupgrading, I want to call for lifts on every floor.   As  the\r\n\r\npopulation ages, we need lifts on every floor, even for  low-rise  buildings.  In the past, buildings below 4 storeys  did\r\n\r\nnot  have any lifts at all.  Many of our blocks of flats  are\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  columns,  in which there are only  two  flats  per\r\n\r\nfloor, and some blocks do not have common corridors.  And  if\r\n\r\nwe  need lifts on every floor, new corridors will have to  be\r\n\r\nconstructed.  This would cost a lot of money, and I think the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  best  be undertaking  this  and  giving  a\r\n\r\nseparate  lift  upgrading programme on  top  of  the  Interim\r\n\r\nUpgrading Programme and Main Upgrading Programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like the Ministry to consider more\r\n\r\ncarefully  in  its planning and think of the handicapped  and\r\n\r\nthe  people  who  are  elderly.   In  terms  of  choosing  of\r\n\r\nmaterials,  for  example, pavements could  have  non-slippery\r\n\r\nmaterials, or material that is not uneven so that people with\r\n\r\nwalking sticks would not stumble against them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should also have ramps and other handicap-friendly community facilities, because as the population gets\r\n\r\nolder  and  there  are  more  disabilities,  these  would  be\r\n\r\nimportant considerations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the phenomenon of\r\n\r\nan ageing population stands out very clearly in the older HDB\r\n\r\nestates.  The issue of providing and enhancing facilities  in\r\n\r\nthe  estates for the convenience of the elderly is very  much\r\n\r\non  the  mind  of town councils, HDB and grassroots  leaders.\r\n\r\nAmong  the  various  amenities, the upgrading  of  lifts  has\r\n\r\nbecome  more and more important.  For the past few  years,  I\r\n\r\nhave  been pestering the Ministry of National Development  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  the lifts in the old estates.  So they called  me  a\r\n\r\nfriend of senior citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are nearly 1,000 blocks of flats which\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  common  corridors.   These  blocks  should  be\r\n\r\ninstalled  with lifts to make it convenient for  the  elderly\r\n\r\ncitizens.   We  all know the importance of lift upgrading  in\r\n\r\nthese blocks, but the question is when to upgrade them.   MND\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  it  be  done during  the  Interim  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme  or the Main Upgrading Programme, but I think  this\r\n\r\nis not a good approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Interim Upgrading Programme is co-sponsored by the\r\n\r\ntown  council and the HDB, and the residents do not  have  to\r\n\r\npay  for the cost.  If the work of lift upgrading is included\r\n\r\nin the IUP, residents will have to bear the extra cost.  This\r\n\r\nwill  have  the effect of discouraging residents from  voting\r\n\r\nfor  the IUP, thus impeding the progress of IUP.  If the work\r\n\r\nis  included in the Main Upgrading Programme, it is not  very\r\n\r\nideal  either,  because the cost of MUP has to  be  partially\r\n\r\nborne  by  the  residents.   With  the  added  cost  of  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading, they will have to bear a greater financial burden.\r\n\r\nThose  less  well  off  residents  would  opt  out  of   this\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that lift upgrading be\r\n\r\ntreated  as  a  special programme by HDB  where  tenders  are\r\n\r\ncalled  on  a collective basis, and carried out  in   stages.\r\n\r\nWithin  five years, all the 1,000 blocks of flats would  have\r\n\r\ntheir  lifts upgraded.  Those blocks which do not have  lifts\r\n\r\nwould have lifts installed.  This will be more convenient  to\r\n\r\nthe  elderly citizens.   An overall tender system will  lower\r\n\r\nthe cost by 20% and will therefore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbenefit  both  MND and the residents who would have  less  to\r\n\r\npay.   May  I  also find out how much will each  resident  be\r\n\r\nexpected to pay?  Will the residents be allowed to use  their\r\n\r\nCPF  savings to pay for the cost?   Can those who are  unable\r\n\r\nto pay be allowed to defer payment until after they have sold\r\n\r\ntheir flats?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, the HDB has built\r\n\r\nsome studio apartments in my constituency in Bedok North,  as\r\n\r\npart  of  a pilot project to enable senior citizens  to  sell\r\n\r\ntheir existing HDB flats and downgrade to smaller apartments,\r\n\r\nthereby  enjoying  additional income  and  maintaining  their\r\n\r\nindependence  and  privacy.  Completion of  these  blocks  of\r\n\r\nflats in my constituency is scheduled for June this year, but\r\n\r\nI  was  told  that the take-up rate has been  very  poor.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  poor take-up rate is because the scheme  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  as attractive as when it was mooted some three  years\r\n\r\nago,  given  the  current state of the  property  market  and\r\n\r\nbecause  the  rules governing eligibility to  purchase  these\r\n\r\nflats are too stringent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I attribute this to the following reasons.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the  lease  for  these  flats  is  only  30  years.\r\n\r\nAlthough  there  was popular request to  increase  it  to  50\r\n\r\nyears, the HDB had turned it down.  Secondly, these flats are\r\n\r\nnon-transferable upon the death of the owner.  In fact,  many\r\n\r\npeople  have  asked what would happen if the  elderly  lessee\r\n\r\ndies prematurely.  Thirdly, the prices of between $60,000 and\r\n\r\n$80,000 per unit for these flats appear high.  I believe  the\r\n\r\nHDB  has recently revised its prices downwards by as much  as\r\n\r\n20%, but not enough to make up for the drop in the prices  of\r\n\r\nexisting HDB flats that these elderly lessees currently  own.\r\n\r\nFourthly, eligible applicants must be existing owners of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats.   My  question  is: why can't we open  the  scheme  to\r\n\r\nowners  of  private apartments and properties as  well?   Or,\r\n\r\nalternatively,  remove  this last  criterion  altogether,  as\r\n\r\nthere are Singaporeans who are willing to buy these flats for\r\n\r\ntheir parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, I would like to ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nreview this scheme, make\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit  more attractive and ease the eligibility criteria for the\r\n\r\npurchase of these apartments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, presently, the\r\n\r\nHDB's  rental programme is meant only for those who are  very\r\n\r\npoor  and cannot afford to purchase flats, and also for those\r\n\r\nwaiting  in the queue to purchase flats and are eligible  for\r\n\r\ntransitional rental flats.  I would like to put up a case for\r\n\r\nHDB  to  consider renting out flats to young married  couples\r\n\r\nwho  are  eligible  for the purchase of flats  but  have  not\r\n\r\ndecided whether to purchase one yet.  Their incomes, however,\r\n\r\nare  not  low enough to qualify for a rental flat  under  the\r\n\r\nexisting  rules.   This group may want to rent  one  for  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  reasons.  Firstly, they may not  have  decided  in\r\n\r\nwhich  location  to live in on a long term basis.   Secondly,\r\n\r\nthey  may  be preparing to work or study overseas for  a  few\r\n\r\nyears before returning home to Singapore.  Thirdly, they  may\r\n\r\nneed the money to start up and nurture their companies rather\r\n\r\nthan  spend it on purchasing a property.  Fourthly, they  may\r\n\r\njust  be  waiting  to go straight into the  private  property\r\n\r\nmarket  at the appropriate time, rather than be tied down  by\r\n\r\nthe 5-year time bar imposed by the HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, there is a social stigma attached to the\r\n\r\nrenting of HDB flats.  It is associated too much with poverty\r\n\r\nand  low income.  If we liberalise the rental scheme and take\r\n\r\ninto consideration this group of young couples, we remove the\r\n\r\nstigma  and meet the needs of many young people at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime.   To  prevent abuse, we can have some  rules  to  allow\r\n\r\ncouples  to rent up to a maximum of 3-5 years.  Older couples\r\n\r\ncan  also  use the scheme later in life for short periods  of\r\n\r\ntime,  such as when their flats are being renovated and  they\r\n\r\nneed  somewhere to live in temporarily, or when their  houses\r\n\r\nare being rebuilt and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will look into this proposal.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ntouch on the philosophy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat Government adopts when determining affordability of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  and  therefore prices.  Government's stated commitment\r\n\r\nis  to price new HDB flats such that 90% of Singaporeans will\r\n\r\nbe able to afford at least a 3-room flat and 70% at least a 4-room  flat.   This  affordability refers to  the  ability  to\r\n\r\nservice  their monthly mortgage repayments using  both  their\r\n\r\nmonthly    CPF   contribution   and   cumulative    balances.\r\n\r\nEligibility   is  capped  at  40%  of  gross  income.    This\r\n\r\nphilosophy  appears to be linked more to  income  levels  and\r\n\r\noverall economic health than housing price levels in general.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it should theoretically be independent of HDB resale\r\n\r\nprices,  executive condominium and private  property  prices.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  reality, I believe there are  expectations  not\r\n\r\nmet,  given the apparent disconnect between the new HDB  flat\r\n\r\nprices  and the overall property market cycle.  Hence,  there\r\n\r\nare  expectations that HDB prices must be adjusted downwards,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  during the current downturn in  both  the  HDB\r\n\r\nresale  and private property markets.  Earlier on, an  upward\r\n\r\nadjustment in new HDB flat prices was made on account of  the\r\n\r\ndesign-and-build programme.  But it may have  coincided  with\r\n\r\nthe upward cycle.  Hence, the perception that new flat prices\r\n\r\nare somehow tied to market trends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister to clarify\r\n\r\nwhether  new HDB flat prices are independently set  based  on\r\n\r\nincome  levels  primarily.  This  is  critical  as  it  would\r\n\r\nprovide a lot of assurance to Singaporeans, especially first-timers  and upgraders, that HDB flats would always be  within\r\n\r\ntheir reach and that there would  not be wild swings in these\r\n\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir, first of all, let me address Members' comments about the\r\n\r\nplight  of  HDB  shopkeepers.  I  believe  this  subject  has\r\n\r\nreceived  considerable attention and airing, both inside  and\r\n\r\noutside  the  House.   Yesterday and  today,  we  heard  many\r\n\r\nMembers  speak  up  about the intense  competition  that  HDB\r\n\r\nshopkeepers  are facing and how Government must do  something\r\n\r\nto help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share these sentiments. In fact, at the parliamentary\r\n\r\nsitting on 22nd February, I assured the House that Government\r\n\r\nwill do something for this group of retailers.  But we should\r\n\r\nnot  forget that a HDB retail shop is, first and foremost,  a\r\n\r\nbusiness.  As with other businesses, HDB shopkeepers have  to\r\n\r\ntake the initiative to adapt to changing consumer demand  and\r\n\r\nto  manage their business risks.  In the long run, whether  a\r\n\r\nshop  survives  and  thrives is not how much  assistance  the\r\n\r\nGovernment gives but whether the shop can attract and  retain\r\n\r\ncustomers.  This is the point that Dr Tan Boon Wan made  just\r\n\r\nnow.   However, the Government will lend a hand to help  them\r\n\r\novercome some of these present difficulties that they face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, Mr Lim Boon Heng, Chairman PSB, unveiled the\r\n\r\nRetail  21  Plan.  This plan recommends that we reinvent  the\r\n\r\nretail  sector  by  raising  retailing  standards,  enhancing\r\n\r\nindustry  efficiency  through upgrading and  retraining,  and\r\n\r\nmanaging the restructuring of the HDB retail sub-sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to inform Members that MND and HDB,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  other relevant agencies, have  formulated  an\r\n\r\nassistance  programme for HDB retailers that  dovetails  with\r\n\r\nthe  Retail  21  Plan.   Our guiding principle  is  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will do what it can to help HDB retailers who  are\r\n\r\nwilling to help themselves.  Hence, the programme focuses  on\r\n\r\nenhancing  the  long-term viability of the HDB retail  sector\r\n\r\nand  not  just on short-term quick fixes.  Specifically,  the\r\n\r\nassistance   programme  consists  of  three  main   elements.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we will provide assistance to both HDB shop  lessees\r\n\r\nand  tenants who wish to upgrade their businesses.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nwe  will  review  HDB rules to grant both  shop  lessees  and\r\n\r\ntenants  greater  flexibility to  adapt  to  changing  market\r\n\r\nconditions.  Thirdly, we will facilitate the exit of HDB shop\r\n\r\ntenants who wish to voluntarily retire from the business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, business upgrading. Business upgrading can be in\r\n\r\nthe form of software, for example, business skills, processes\r\n\r\nand rules; or hardware, in other words,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  physical environment.  The Government's assistance  will\r\n\r\nbe  in  both  areas.   I would first touch  on  the  software\r\n\r\naspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB's assistance programme. The Retail 21 Plan includes\r\n\r\ntwo  programmes,  namely,  the  Retail  Essential  Assistance\r\n\r\nProgramme  and  the Franchise 21 Assistance  Programme,  both\r\n\r\nunder PSB.  These programmes can help HDB shopkeepers upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir businesses.  I would like to encourage HDB retailers to\r\n\r\nmake  full use of them in order to compete with both the huge\r\n\r\nmalls as well as the convenience store chains, like 7-Eleven,\r\n\r\nas   some  Members  have  brought  up  in  this  House.    Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan asked whether the programmes will be  available\r\n\r\nin languages other than English.  The answer is yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, flexibility in use of shops. Many Members,\r\n\r\nincluding  Dr Lily Neo, Dr Ker Sin Tze, Prof. Toh  See  Kiat,\r\n\r\nhave  suggested  the  HDB grant greater  flexibility  to  HDB\r\n\r\nshopkeepers for change of use.  However, at the same time,  I\r\n\r\nhear Dr Teo Ho Pin, for example, say that the HDB should  not\r\n\r\nbe  too  free granting this flexibility, and that indeed  HDB\r\n\r\nshould  proactively determine the retail  mix,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nresidents' needs are met.  Of course, there are other Members\r\n\r\nwho  seem to suggest that HDB should somehow do both  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time.  In other words, control the mix on the one hand,\r\n\r\nand yet be more flexible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, HDB has got to weigh the pros and cons of\r\n\r\nboth  approaches  and  find the correct  balance,  guided  of\r\n\r\ncourse  by the interests of both HDB retailers and residents.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not an easy balance to find.  If necessary,  I  may\r\n\r\nhave  to ask HDB to consult the advisers on what their  views\r\n\r\nare   as   far   as   specific   approvals   are   concerned.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, HDB will be more flexible in granting  approval\r\n\r\nfor  change  of  use  and trade, such as shop  showrooms  and\r\n\r\noffices, as suggested by Dr Ker, but we will continue  to  be\r\n\r\ncautious with conversion to, say, eating houses or industrial\r\n\r\ntrades  as  these  are  likely to  cause  nuisance  to  their\r\n\r\nresidents - nuisance such as parking, noise, and so on.  I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  Members  would want to face the  wrath  of  their\r\n\r\nresidents when\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey find that their convenience store or shop downstairs  is\r\n\r\nsuddenly  turned into a shop selling spare parts for lorries,\r\n\r\nfor example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So such a move will allow HDB lessees and tenants to\r\n\r\nkeep  up  with  the  changes  in  the  environment  and   the\r\n\r\nresidents' needs.  But, in the long run, it is the residents,\r\n\r\nas well as the consumers, and not HDB, who will determine the\r\n\r\nretail  mix for the area.  This new policy will apply to  HDB\r\n\r\nshops  in  the traditional neighbourhood as well as shops  in\r\n\r\nstand-alone  neighbourhood centres that are  at  least  three\r\n\r\nyears old.  The reason for this is because some of the stand-alone  centres have only recently been built and the shopping\r\n\r\nmix  there  is not stabilised yet.  HDB feels that  it  needs\r\n\r\nthree  years  at least for the shopping mix to be stabilised.\r\n\r\nBearing the concerns of some Members in mind over such  trade\r\n\r\nliberalisation, HDB will monitor closely the outcome of these\r\n\r\nrelaxation rules and, if necessary, make adjustments as we go\r\n\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Peh Chin Hua mentioned that some\r\n\r\nshopkeepers find that their shop areas are too big.  Dr  Lily\r\n\r\nNeo,  in fact, suggested the idea of splitting the shops into\r\n\r\nsmaller  units.  I am pleased to inform them  that  HDB  will\r\n\r\nallow  tenants  to  sublet  up to 50%  of  their  traditional\r\n\r\nneighbourhood shops if the floor area is at least  50  square\r\n\r\nmetres.   This will allow them to maximise the use  of  their\r\n\r\nspace.   They  will  also be allowed to sublet  their  living\r\n\r\nquarters  for residential use.  And for sold shops, HDB  will\r\n\r\nallow  shopowners to use the living quarters  for  commercial\r\n\r\npurposes, as recommended by Dr Ker.   But, as pointed out  by\r\n\r\nProf.  Toh  See Kiat, and correctly so, most living  quarters\r\n\r\nare  structurally designed only for residential use.   So  if\r\n\r\nthe shopowners wish to conduct commercial activities in these\r\n\r\nquarters, they would have to find some way to strengthen  the\r\n\r\nfloors  of  their  quarters.  They would  have  to  make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary application to HDB who will conduct some structural\r\n\r\nanalysis of the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from software, upgrading the physical environment\r\n\r\nwill also help to improve the business of HDB shops.  Dr\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nLily  Neo  suggested sometime ago that HDB shops should  band\r\n\r\ntogether   to   form  commercial  streets  with   distinctive\r\n\r\nfeatures.  This is a very workable idea.  In fact, there  are\r\n\r\nmany examples - Marine Parade, Chong Pang city, Tampines, Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  Town Centre, and so on.  All these examples show  that\r\n\r\nsuch  projects  are successful when they originate  from  the\r\n\r\nlocal  community.   I would therefore like to  encourage  HDB\r\n\r\nshopkeepers to market their shops and their town  centres  in\r\n\r\nconjunction with their town councils and grassroots  leaders.\r\n\r\nI  will  ask  the  Community Improvement  Projects  Committee\r\n\r\n(CIPC) to consider extending funding support for more of such\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua yesterday expressed concern over the\r\n\r\ncost  of the Main Upgrading Programme for the shopowners.   I\r\n\r\nam  pleased to inform him that the Government will  make  MUP\r\n\r\nmore affordable to shop lessees.  Currently, HDB shop lessees\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay  full cost for the standard MUP package.   With\r\n\r\nimmediate  effect, all MUP precincts that have not  undergone\r\n\r\npolling,  the  HDB  will subsidise 50% of  the  cost  of  the\r\n\r\nstandard package.  HDB will also give a 50% discount off  the\r\n\r\nmarket  value of the space-adding item, up from today's  30%.\r\n\r\nWith  this  change,  shopkeepers can  save  some  $10,000  to\r\n\r\n$15,000 per shop on the upgrading work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Ong Kian Min and Mr Sinnakaruppan,\r\n\r\namong  others, observed that there is an oversupply of  shops\r\n\r\nin  older HDB estates.  This observation was borne out by the\r\n\r\nfindings of the Retail 21 Committee which has suggested  that\r\n\r\nthe HDB reduce the number of shops.  The question, of course,\r\n\r\nis,  reduce by how much?  HDB does not have the answer.   The\r\n\r\nmarket and the shopkeepers themselves must decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government understands that some shopkeepers in\r\n\r\nthese   areas,   especially   the  elderly   first-generation\r\n\r\nshopkeepers,  may  wish  to retire  from  the  business.   To\r\n\r\nfacilitate  this,  HDB  will  introduce  a  pilot   Voluntary\r\n\r\nRetirement Scheme for HDB shop tenants this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  pilot scheme will involve about 500 HDB rental shops  at\r\n\r\nselected areas where business is weak.  Eligible shop tenants\r\n\r\nwho  wish  to retire can voluntarily give up their  tenancies\r\n\r\nand receive an ex-gratia payment of $48,000.  If response  to\r\n\r\nthe scheme is favourable, it will be extended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise that the scheme is entirely\r\n\r\nvoluntary.   This  should allay Mr Chay Wai  Chuen's  concern\r\n\r\nexpressed  yesterday about the implications on the livelihood\r\n\r\nof  those  who depend on their shops for income.  Shopkeepers\r\n\r\nwho  wish  to seek a fresh career in another sector  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  seek help from the Ministry of Manpower which  will\r\n\r\nadvise  on  job  opportunities and suggest suitable  training\r\n\r\ncourses.   Those  who  choose to continue  operating  in  the\r\n\r\nvicinity  will receive assistance to upgrade their  business.\r\n\r\nTheir  shops  will  be grouped together for greater  business\r\n\r\nsynergy  and each tenant will receive a removal allowance  of\r\n\r\n$5,000.  They will also be encouraged to make use of the  two\r\n\r\nnew programmes under Retail 21 to upgrade and modernise their\r\n\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress that the $48,000 ex-gratia payment is not\r\n\r\nin  lieu  of running their shops.  It is an ex-gratia payment\r\n\r\nfrom Government to help them to decide whether they have  the\r\n\r\nstamina  and the strength to carry on.  If they do not,  they\r\n\r\nhave a sweetener from the Government.  And if they do want to\r\n\r\ncarry  on, there is a package to help them to upgrade and  to\r\n\r\ncompete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min yesterday suggested that HDB should\r\n\r\nadvise  shopkeepers  on  how to set up  shops,  how  much  to\r\n\r\ntender,  etc.   This is really not HDB's job, and  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  HDB  is  in the best position to do so  in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace.  I would advise anyone who wishes to set up shop to do\r\n\r\ntheir sums and weigh their risks before taking the plunge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Voluntary Retirement Scheme is meant for shop\r\n\r\ntenants.  A few Members asked whether HDB could also buy back\r\n\r\nshops from owners who wish to exit.  Sir,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  answer  is  no.   It would not be  appropriate  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  do  so.  The  Government cannot  protect  HDB\r\n\r\nshopowners  against fluctuations in consumer demand  and  the\r\n\r\nproperty  market.  Those who decided to buy their shops  have\r\n\r\nto  accept  this business risk.  If they wish to  sell  their\r\n\r\nshops,  they  can do so on the resale market.  HDB  tells  me\r\n\r\nthat most of the first-hand owners will be able to sell their\r\n\r\nshops  above  their original purchase prices.  Alternatively,\r\n\r\nto lighten their mortgage repayment burden, owners of 99-year\r\n\r\nlease shops can adopt Mr Peh Chin Hua's suggestion to request\r\n\r\nHDB to convert their shops to shorter 30-year leases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members suggested that HDB should give ex-gratia\r\n\r\npayment  to such shopowners.  I would like to highlight  that\r\n\r\nthe  shopkeepers who bought their shops from HDB have already\r\n\r\nenjoyed very large upfront discounts: $96,000 for shops  that\r\n\r\nwere  sold  on the 99-year lease and $48,000 for  those  that\r\n\r\nwere sold with a 30-year lease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also asked for rental and property tax\r\n\r\nrebates.  I would like to point out that, in addition to  the\r\n\r\nnew  assistance  programme, these measures, in  other  words,\r\n\r\nproperty  tax  rebates  and rental rebates,  are  already  in\r\n\r\nplace.  The 25% property tax rebate has been extended to June\r\n\r\nthis  year after which it will be replaced by a reduction  in\r\n\r\nthe  property tax rate from 12% to 10%, as announced  by  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister.  The Government will also continue with the\r\n\r\ncurrent  rental rebate until the end of this  year  and  will\r\n\r\nreview the situation before that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen and Mr Chng Hee Kok enquired whether\r\n\r\nHDB  will  again sell shops under the Sale of Tenanted  Shops\r\n\r\nScheme.   Based on what we have heard so far, the HDB  retail\r\n\r\nsector is still very weak and my view is that it will not  be\r\n\r\nprudent   for  the  HDB  to  sell  shops  at  this  juncture.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if there are specific requests from advisors, I\r\n\r\nwill ask HDB to consider each case on its own merits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, there are fundamental changes\r\n\r\naffecting the business\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  livelihood of HDB  retailers.   Shopkeepers\r\n\r\nthemselves  must understand and take active steps to  respond\r\n\r\nto  these  changes.   They  have to assess  their  individual\r\n\r\nsituation and they have to decide whether they want to remain\r\n\r\nin  this trade and, if so, how to revitalise their businesses\r\n\r\nto  successfully ride the wave of change.  On its  part,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  support HDB retailers  in  ways  that  will\r\n\r\nreinforce  what  they do for themselves.  I hope  that,  over\r\n\r\ntime, these measures will bring sustained benefits, not  only\r\n\r\nto  the  retailers, but also to their customers who  are  HDB\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for the Environment would be\r\n\r\nannouncing  similar assistance measures for  stallholders  in\r\n\r\nmarkets  and hawker centres which are managed by HDB and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the comments made on the\r\n\r\nupgrading programme.  First of all, I wish to address Dr Wang\r\n\r\nKai  Yuen's  point about a review of the MUP and  IUP.   Sir,\r\n\r\nover  the  last  10  years, the Main  and  Interim  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgrammes that are being carried out by the Government  have\r\n\r\ntransformed the landscape of many parts of Singapore.   Older\r\n\r\nHDB  towns  and estates, like Toa Payoh and MacPherson,  have\r\n\r\nbeen  spruced  up.  They have new facilities, like  walkways,\r\n\r\nplaygrounds,  and  parks.   The flats  themselves  have  seen\r\n\r\nimprovements to their homes, like new bathroom finishes, main\r\n\r\ndoors  and  front windows and, in some cases,  an  additional\r\n\r\nutility room.  Flat owners have seen their flats increase  in\r\n\r\nvalue.  When their friends and relatives come to visit  them,\r\n\r\nthe  transformation is immediately obvious.  They can see the\r\n\r\ndifference.  So I believe that the MUP and IUP programmes are\r\n\r\nvalued  by the residents and that they serve a very important\r\n\r\npurpose in transforming our HDB estates and making sure  that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not deteriorate into the slums that we see in  many\r\n\r\nother parts of the world when we talk about public housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upgrading programmes fulfil the promise by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  it  will share budget  surpluses  with  the\r\n\r\npeople,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nespecially the lower income.  And that is the reason why  the\r\n\r\nupgrading programmes are heavily subsidised by the Government\r\n\r\nand  skewed in favour of the smaller flats.  For example, the\r\n\r\n1-  to 3-room flat lessees pay around $3,000 per flat for the\r\n\r\nstandard  package, and this represents only about 7%  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  cost  of  the  upgrading.  And if  they  opt  for  the\r\n\r\nadditional  room,  the  space adding item,  their  co-payment\r\n\r\namount is around $10,000.  Is this good value for money?   If\r\n\r\nyou  take the last 10 years, the number of precincts that had\r\n\r\nbeen polled, so far, we had 98 precincts that had been polled\r\n\r\nfor  MUP, at least 90% of flat owners had voted in favour  of\r\n\r\nthe  standard  package.  So I believe  the  answer  is,  yes.\r\n\r\nResidents do find them very good value for money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the upgrading programmes are possible only because\r\n\r\nour   people   continue  to  support  the  Government   which\r\n\r\nconsistently generates budget surpluses through policies  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes which generate growth and which prudently  manages\r\n\r\nnational expenditures.  That is why in the implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe  MUP and IUP, the Government has given priority to  those\r\n\r\nwho  have actively supported these programmes.  Without them,\r\n\r\nit would not have been possible.  It is as simple as that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked specific questions about the\r\n\r\nupgrading  programme for this year.  I am pleased  to  inform\r\n\r\nthem  that  my Ministry will be introducing three initiatives\r\n\r\nthat will allow more HDB residents to benefit from upgrading.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, MND will revise the age criterion for the  Main\r\n\r\nand Interim Upgrading Programmes to enable the programmes  to\r\n\r\ncover  more  flats.  Secondly, we will step up the  upgrading\r\n\r\nschedules this year.  And, thirdly, we will introduce  a  new\r\n\r\nLift Upgrading Programme (LUP) to complement the MUP and  the\r\n\r\nIUP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, MUP and IUP. The age of an HDB block is one of\r\n\r\nthe   considerations  when  MND  selects  precincts  for  the\r\n\r\nupgrading.   Currently,  HDB blocks which  are  completed  in\r\n\r\n1975, or earlier, can be considered for the MUP.  HDB\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nblocks  that  were  completed  between  1976  and  1983   are\r\n\r\nconsidered  for IUP.  Based on these existing  criteria,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has announced MUP and IUP for more  than  230,000\r\n\r\nHDB  flats.   To  increase the number of HDB flats  that  can\r\n\r\nbenefit  from upgrading, I wish to inform Dr Teo Ho Pin  that\r\n\r\nthe  new cut-off age for the MUP will be HDB blocks completed\r\n\r\nby  1980,  while HDB blocks completed between 1981  and  1986\r\n\r\nwill  be considered for the IUP.  In other words, HDB  blocks\r\n\r\nthat  are  between 15 and 20 years today can look forward  to\r\n\r\nthe  IUP, those that are at least 21 years will be considered\r\n\r\nfor the MUP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This revision of the age criterion signifies the\r\n\r\nGovernment's commitment to the upgrading programmes on a long-term  basis  so  long  as  our  financial  situation  allows.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  as  the IUP is intended as a precursor  to  the\r\n\r\nMUP,  hence  the term  \"interim\", the revised  criteria  will\r\n\r\nallow  some HDB blocks that have already undergone IUP to  be\r\n\r\neligible for MUP.  With the revised criteria, another 240,000\r\n\r\nflats  can be considered for upgrading, making it a total  of\r\n\r\n540,000  flats, almost two thirds of the total stock  of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats which are now within the ambit of the IUP and MUP.  The\r\n\r\nadditional  Government  expenditure  is  estimated  at   $3.9\r\n\r\nbillion for the MUP and $760 million for the IUP in the  next\r\n\r\n10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MND will use the new age criterion to select MUP\r\n\r\nand  IUP  precincts for the year 2001 this year.  In view  of\r\n\r\nour  strong  budget  position in  financial  year  2000,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  increase  the  number  of  precincts   for\r\n\r\nupgrading  this year.  And MND will select 18  precincts  for\r\n\r\nthe  MUP  and 22 precincts for the IUP.  The numbers will  be\r\n\r\nsustained next year if we continue to enjoy budget surpluses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP). Several Members have\r\n\r\nasked  about lift upgrading for those blocks whose  lifts  do\r\n\r\nnot  stop  on every floor.  There are about 4,000 such  high-rise  HDB  blocks and they were all built before 1990.   Many\r\n\r\nMembers, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Chng Hee Kok, Mr Sinnakaruppan, Mr\r\n\r\nAng Mong Seng, among others, have spoken about the need for a\r\n\r\nseparate lift upgrading\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Last year, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the\r\n\r\nAgeing Population also recommended that the Government should\r\n\r\nprogressively retrofit HDB flats with lift landings on  every\r\n\r\nfloor   to  improve  accessibility  and  mobility   for   our\r\n\r\nresidents,  especially the elderly and the  disabled.   I  am\r\n\r\npleased  to  announce  that  MND will  introduce  a  new  and\r\n\r\nseparate lift upgrading programme for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new LUP will provide all flats in high-rise HDB\r\n\r\nblocks  built  before 1990 direct access  to  a  lift,  where\r\n\r\ntechnically  feasible of course.  The  scope  of  works  will\r\n\r\ninclude  addition of new lift, lift shaft, lift  landing  and\r\n\r\nrefurbishing of lift lobbies.  The LUP can be carried out  on\r\n\r\nits  own  or together with the MUP and IUP.  This is a  major\r\n\r\nexercise.  The total estimated cost is about $4.8 billion, if\r\n\r\nwe  are  talking of all the flats before 1990.  We  certainly\r\n\r\ncannot  afford to implement it overnight.  It  will  take  us\r\n\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lift upgrading is very costly, HDB will require all\r\n\r\nflat  owners  in an HDB block, except those who live  on  the\r\n\r\nground  floor, because they do not benefit from it,  to  poll\r\n\r\nand  to  co-pay for the lift upgrading works.  The co-payment\r\n\r\narrangement is in keeping with the philosophy adopted for the\r\n\r\nMUP, where the Government subsidises most but not 100% of the\r\n\r\ncost.   It  will give residents a sense of ownership  of  the\r\n\r\nproject and ensure that they consider carefully the need  for\r\n\r\nsuch works when they are asked whether they want it or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of the MUP, the Lift Upgrading Programme\r\n\r\nwill proceed only if at least 75% of eligible owners vote  in\r\n\r\nfavour.  The exact co-payment ratio and amount will depend on\r\n\r\nthe  flat type as well as the type of HDB blocks.  Generally,\r\n\r\nthe  smaller  flat type will pay less, as in  the  MUP.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment will bear the lion's share of the cost  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the programme is affordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several town councils have also indicated that they\r\r\n\r\nwould  like  to help make lift upgrading more affordable  for\r\n\r\ntheir  residents.  Hence, MND has included town  councils  in\r\n\r\nthe  co-payment arrangement to help flat lessees  defray  the\r\n\r\ncost of lift\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nupgrading.  The town council should be allowed to  use  their\r\n\r\nsinking funds for this purpose.  With the contributions  from\r\n\r\nGovernment and town councils, the co-payment amount will be a\r\n\r\nfew  hundred  dollars per flat for the majority  of  lessees,\r\n\r\nwhere the provision of lifts is relatively straightforward, a\r\n\r\nfew hundred dollars.  But for the so-called segmented blocks,\r\n\r\nwhich Prof Toh mentioned just now, where additional lifts and\r\n\r\nlift  shafts are needed, it can be more expensive.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will set a cap of $3,000 per  flat  on  each\r\n\r\nshare by the lessee and the town council.  In addition,  flat\r\n\r\nowners  who need help in paying their share of the costs  can\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  several assistance schemes that are  currently\r\n\r\navailable for MUP.  HDB will release further details on  this\r\n\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as other elderly and handicapped-friendly\r\n\r\nfeatures are concerned, such as those suggested by Prof.  Toh\r\n\r\nSee  Kiat,  I  wish to assure him that HDB will  continue  to\r\n\r\nincorporate  these features in the upgrading  programmes,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as in the design of new flats, and it will continue  to\r\n\r\nbe  mindful  of  the need to provide such facilities  in  HDB\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan touched upon the issue of SERS. I think he asked\r\n\r\nwhether  we  should do SERS instead of MUP  and  IUP,  and  I\r\n\r\nexplained earlier why I feel that there is still a continuing\r\n\r\nneed  for  the upgrading programmes.  Yes, we will  do  SERS,\r\n\r\nbecause  MUP,  IUP  and SERS all contribute  to  the  overall\r\n\r\nrejuvenation  of  our HDB estates, but they  serve  different\r\n\r\npurposes.  The MUP and IUP serve one purpose, and SERS serves\r\n\r\nanother   purpose.   SERS  is,  in  effect,  a  redevelopment\r\n\r\nprogramme that helps to optimise land use, as he pointed out.\r\n\r\nSo  we will continue to do all three, and we will select SERS\r\n\r\nsites as and when they are appropriate, and announce them  at\r\n\r\nthe appropriate time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the issues of allocation, pricing and\r\n\r\nfinancing  of HDB flats which some other Members brought  up.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, on the question of allocation, I agree\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  Dr Teo Ho Pin that HDB's flat allocation system can  be\r\n\r\nreviewed  to provide more options for flat buyers.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nseveral  MPs  earlier  alerted me that  flat  applicants  are\r\n\r\nactually  getting  their flats faster than  they  want  them.\r\n\r\nThis  is certainly a turnaround from the time when MPs  would\r\n\r\napproach the Ministry and HDB to ask for flats to be  brought\r\n\r\nforward  because their residents were waiting a long time  to\r\n\r\nget  their  flats.  But I realise that, in certain cases,  it\r\n\r\ndoes present certain problems.  I have, therefore, asked  HDB\r\n\r\nto  review  its  flat  allocation  system  to  make  it  more\r\n\r\nresponsive to applicants' needs.  I am pleased to inform  him\r\n\r\nthat  HDB  will  pilot a new system called the build-to-order\r\n\r\nsystem  later  this year, which will give  flat  buyers  more\r\n\r\nflexibility  in timing, as well as a greater say and  control\r\n\r\nover the location of their new flats.  Again, I will ask  HDB\r\n\r\nto release the details later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua wanted to know whether the pricing of\r\n\r\nHDB flats is linked to the prices of resale flats and private\r\n\r\nproperties,  or  whether  they are  independently  set.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  objective is to encourage  home  ownership,  so\r\n\r\nthat every Singaporean family can have a stake in the nation.\r\n\r\nSo, the primary consideration in the pricing of HDB flats  is\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the vast majority of Singaporeans, especially\r\n\r\nthe  young couples and the lower-income families, can  become\r\n\r\nhomeowners.  So, HDB takes into account the prevailing prices\r\n\r\nof HDB resale flats, when it reviews the selling price of its\r\n\r\nflats  every quarter.  This is because resale flats represent\r\n\r\nthe  true market value of HDB flats at any point in time, and\r\n\r\nthey  give  an  indication of Singaporeans'  willingness  and\r\n\r\nability  to  pay for their HDB flats.  It is not  appropriate\r\n\r\nfor  HDB to peg the selling prices of HDB flats to, say,  the\r\n\r\nprivate residential property prices because, obviously,  they\r\n\r\nare  catering to different markets.  But I can assure Mrs Lim\r\n\r\nthat  affordability of HDB flats is a paramount consideration\r\n\r\nin the pricing of our HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau suggested that we should introduce a\r\n\r\nrental scheme.  Again,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  reiterate that our objective is home ownership, so it does\r\n\r\nnot  make  sense  for us to encourage or set  up  a  separate\r\n\r\nrental scheme in parallel with the ownership programme.  Yes,\r\n\r\nsome  young couples or families may want to rent.  There  are\r\n\r\nample  opportunities for them to do so.  So, HDB has no  plan\r\n\r\nto implement a rental scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked whether we can help young couples to\r\n\r\npurchase  HDB  flats in older estates.  What this  means,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is  that those young couples who wish to  move  into\r\n\r\nolder  estates would have to buy resale flats from  the  open\r\n\r\nmarket.   To  help them to do so, the HDB has the  CPF  grant\r\n\r\nscheme,  either $30,000 or $40,000, depending  on  where  the\r\n\r\nflats are, which can be used to meet the 20% downpayment  for\r\n\r\nthe  resale  flat.   They  can also use  their  CPF  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount  contributions for the 20% downpayment, and  this,  I\r\n\r\nmust point out, is already a special concession for buyers of\r\n\r\nHDB  flats.  So there are no other schemes that are available\r\n\r\nfor young couples to buy into older estates, apart from these\r\n\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two more quick points. Mr Chng suggested that HDB\r\n\r\nshould  leave  the building of flats to the  private  sector.\r\n\r\nOver the years, HDB has in fact taken active steps to involve\r\n\r\nthe  private sector in the public housing programme,  through\r\n\r\nthe  design-and-build scheme and, in fact, even  through  the\r\n\r\nupgrading schemes, ie, the MUP and IUP.  With the closure  of\r\n\r\nthe  Executive flat queue about four or five years  ago,  the\r\n\r\nHDB  also  farmed  out  the development  of  ECs  to  private\r\n\r\ndevelopers.   So,  yes,  HDB is already  doing  so  and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to look for ways to involve the private  sector  in\r\n\r\npublic housing projects.  But it is not yet in a position  of\r\n\r\nsaying that it is not going to build any more flats, or it is\r\n\r\nnot going to build any more of the bigger flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Mr Chew Heng Ching's point about studio\r\n\r\napartments.  He asked for a review of the scheme  for  studio\r\n\r\napartments.  I wish to inform him that we will take  note  of\r\n\r\nhis  comments,  and  I  will ask HDB  to  review  the  studio\r\n\r\napartment scheme to make it more accessible to the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I remind hon.

We need 75% to agree for this upgrading.  But  if\r\n\r\nthe  lift landing is on alternate floors, there will only  be\r\n\r\n50% who is going to support it.  And, if it is on every third\r\n\r\nfloor,  it  is  very likely that the others,  who  have  lift\r\n\r\nlandings,  will not support it.  So I am not so sure  whether\r\n\r\nwe can get 75% of the residents to agree.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I think the general principle is\r\n\r\nthat  where there is benefit to the residents - the  benefits\r\n\r\nmay be more to certain residents because they happen to be on\r\n\r\nthe  floor  where there is no lift, and the  benefit  to  the\r\n\r\nresident who already has a lift landing may be less - but  it\r\n\r\nis  in the overall interest of the block - so they will  have\r\n\r\nto  take the overall interest into account.

I am\r\n\r\nconfident  that  they will be able to get that  75%  approval\r\n\r\nvote.   It really depends on how we sell the benefits of  the\r\n\r\nlift  upgrading programme and, of course, ultimately, on  the\r\n\r\namounts  that they would have to pay.

There are several criteria required to be met  by  the\r\n\r\nprecincts  or  blocks,  if they are  to  be  chosen  for  the\r\n\r\nupgrading programme.  These criteria include the age  of  the\r\n\r\nblock,  the location of the block - because we want  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that there is a spread throughout the island -  and  an\r\n\r\nindication of support for the programme.  So, if there is  no\r\n\r\nindication of their support for the programme or if,  indeed,\r\n\r\nthe  residents  in that area do not want the programme,  then\r\n\r\nthat precinct will not be chosen for upgrading, or it will be\r\n\r\nchosen   for  upgrading  at  a  lower  priority  than   other\r\n\r\nprecincts.

Spalling concrete from the ceiling, exposing the\r\n\r\nrusty metal bars; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Leaks from the kitchen and bathroom ceilings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with such complaints, the HDB's reply is,\r\n\r\ninvariably,  that the residents concerned should  be  jointly\r\n\r\nliable for the repairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the problem of spalling concrete, the HDB would\r\n\r\nnormally  undertake  one  repair  job  free  of  charge  but,\r\n\r\nthereafter,  if the same problem emerges again,  the  lessees\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  get their own contractors to carry  out  the\r\n\r\nrepairs,  at  their  own expense.   The problem  of  spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete occurs in the older flats.  It is said that, at that\r\n\r\ntime, the HDB was in a hurry to complete the construction  of\r\n\r\nthe  flats, and the sand imported from Indonesia and Malaysia\r\n\r\nfor use by the contractors had very high salt content.  After\r\n\r\nsome time, the metal bars became corroded because of the salt\r\n\r\nin  the  concrete.  The rust formed on the metal bars  caused\r\n\r\nthem to expand, resulting in the spalling of the cement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of repair, if the rust on the metal bars is\r\n\r\nnot  properly treated and thoroughly removed, the  bars  will\r\n\r\nbecome rusty again, and the cement will spall again.  Looking\r\n\r\nat  the  exposed  metal  bars on the ceiling,  the  residents\r\n\r\ncannot  help feeling uneasy and stressed.  When the HDB  asks\r\n\r\nthe residents to rectify the matter themselves, the residents\r\n\r\nwould  normally engage some small-time contractors to do  the\r\n\r\njob.   Not  having  the relevant expertise,  the  contractors\r\n\r\nwould  just patch up, plaster and paint over the part of  the\r\n\r\nceiling.  Soon after, the spalling would appear again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaks from the kitchen and bathroom ceiling are another\r\n\r\nnagging  problem. This may be due to the water-proof membrane\r\n\r\nat  the flooring of the unit above being defective.  It could\r\n\r\nhave  been  damaged  by  the resident upstairs  when  he  was\r\n\r\nrepairing the floor tiles too.  The dirty water dripping down\r\n\r\nfrom the ceiling\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  certainly  affect the daily living  of  the  residents\r\n\r\ndownstairs.  What HDB does is to ask the residents  to  share\r\n\r\nin  the  cost of repairs.  The resident downstairs is not  at\r\n\r\nfault at all.  Apart from suffering the inconvenience of  the\r\n\r\ndripping water, he has also to bear part of the repair  cost.\r\n\r\nThis  seems to be somewhat illogical and unfair.  It is  like\r\n\r\nthe stupid rulings made by the foolish mandarins who punished\r\n\r\nboth  the plaintiff and defendant irrespective of who was  at\r\n\r\nfault  we  saw  in the Teochew wayangs in our  younger  days.\r\n\r\nSometimes,  even when the resident downstairs is  willing  to\r\n\r\npay  for his share of the repairs, the resident upstairs  may\r\n\r\nnot  be prepared to come up with the money.  This will result\r\n\r\nin the matter being dragged on indefinitely and unsettled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that the HDB will take some positive steps to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  residents.  For the problem of  spalling  concrete\r\n\r\nfrom the ceiling, the HDB should engage contractors with  the\r\n\r\nrelevant expertise to carry out the repairs.  Otherwise,  the\r\n\r\nsmall-time  contractors engaged by the  residents  themselves\r\n\r\nmay  not  have  the  expertise and  they  may  just  do  some\r\n\r\nperfunctory  job of patching up.  The same problem  will  re-surface again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for leaks from the ceiling, HDB should investigate\r\n\r\nwhether  the  water-proof membrane has been  damaged  by  the\r\n\r\nresident  upstairs.  If so, the resident upstairs  should  be\r\n\r\nsolely  liable  for  the repair costs.  If  not,  HDB  should\r\n\r\narrange  for contractors with the expertise to carry out  the\r\n\r\nrepairs and, subsequently, ask the residents to jointly  bear\r\n\r\nthe  repair  costs.   In this way, the repair  work  will  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  expeditiously and properly, and  the  pointless\r\n\r\nquarrels between the affected residents can be avoided.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, for ceiling leakage,\r\n\r\nI support what Dr Ker has said.  According to the current HDB\r\n\r\nregulations, if there is a leakage in the ceiling of a  flat,\r\n\r\nboth  the  residents  above  and  below  would  have  to   be\r\n\r\nresponsible for the repair and pay for the costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receiving complaints about the ceiling leakage, HDB\r\n\r\noften  tells  the residents affected that the  ceiling  is  a\r\n\r\nparty\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstructure,  separating the unit above from  the  unit  below.\r\n\r\nHence,  the  two families have to share the cost  of  repair.\r\n\r\nHDB  would not be responsible.  The officials would tell  the\r\n\r\nresident below to discuss with the resident above on  how  to\r\n\r\nproceed with the repair and share the cost.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is a multiracial society, there is\r\n\r\nsometimes    some    difficulty    in    communication.    So\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  could arise when they  try  to  communicate\r\n\r\nwith  each other and this may lead to a conflict.  It is  bad\r\n\r\nfor  our  social  cohesiveness.  When such a problem  is  not\r\n\r\nresolved, the residents staying below will have to  carry  an\r\n\r\numbrella  whenever they use the toilet.   As  both  lack  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  flat  maintenance, they could  have  different\r\n\r\nviews  when approaching the contractor to repair the leakage,\r\n\r\nand on the question of cost sharing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that HDB, as the landlord, should come in to\r\n\r\nhelp.   After ascertaining the cost of the leakage,  the  HDB\r\n\r\ncould  get  a  qualified contractor to undertake  the  repair\r\n\r\nunder a standard package, and at a reasonable cost.  The work\r\n\r\ndone should be checked by the HDB.  To alleviate the hardship\r\n\r\nof  the residents, HDB should bear one-third or more of  such\r\n\r\nrepair cost.  I hope that HDB would accept my suggestions  so\r\n\r\nas  to  render a better service for the bulk of the residents\r\n\r\nin their estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, many of the flats in Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  estate, which were completed in a hurry in 1984 to  be\r\n\r\nin  time for the election that year, were poorly built.   The\r\n\r\nworkmanship  was sloppy and the materials used were  of  poor\r\n\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gable end of the building has two walls. The\r\n\r\noutside  wall comprises fence-faced red bricks and the  inner\r\n\r\nwall  is  made of cement blocks.  What has happened  is  that\r\n\r\nover the last ten years or so, rainwater has seeped into  the\r\n\r\ngable  end  walls and the water gets collected in  the  space\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two  walls. Due to bad workmanship,  the  water\r\n\r\ntrapped in the space between the two walls is unable to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nescape.   The holes in the lower end of the outside wall  are\r\n\r\nblocked by fallen cement during construction.  As a result of\r\n\r\npoor  workmanship,  the water in the space  between  the  two\r\n\r\nwalls is unable to escape and got trapped in the space.   The\r\n\r\nwater  can rise to about five or six feet.  The trapped water\r\n\r\nseeps  into  the wall in the inside of the rooms  and  causes\r\n\r\nthem  to be very damp.  The paint in the wall would peel off,\r\n\r\nno  matter  how many times the residents repainted the  walls\r\n\r\nover with a new coat of paint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this kind of a problem, my town council at Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  has to break the inner wall, draw the water  out,  get\r\n\r\nrid  of the fallen cement debris at the bottom of that space.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we build the wall and give that wall a fresh coat\r\n\r\nof  paint.  We have done this operation for many flats.   The\r\n\r\noperations have taken up a lot of effort and finances on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  my  town council.  These repair works need  not  be\r\n\r\nnecessary if the HDB had, in the first place, done  its  work\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only had such complaints of water seepage and\r\n\r\npeeling walls been satisfactorily done up by my town council,\r\n\r\nbut  other  complaints  of spalling concrete,  choked  sewage\r\n\r\ndrains, uneven drains, sunken aprons and water seepage at the\r\n\r\nceiling  had  all been repaired by my town council  at  great\r\n\r\ncost.   I  bring  these  matters up  to  highlight  the  poor\r\n\r\nworkmanship of the HDB and ask the Minister whether  the  HDB\r\n\r\nis  willing to accept responsibility for the poor workmanship\r\n\r\nin  those flats and whether it is willing to absorb the  cost\r\n\r\nof  repairs.  After all, HDB is the landlord and it has  been\r\n\r\n17  years since these flats were built.  It is time that  HDB\r\n\r\nspent  some  money  to  make good  the  faults  due  to  poor\r\n\r\nworkmanship.  We, at Potong Pasir, do not receive CIPC  funds\r\n\r\nand  the HDB should take this into consideration and be  more\r\n\r\ngenerous on us.  Those repairs are necessary.  They  are  not\r\n\r\nto  beautify the flats, but are required to make them livable\r\n\r\nor tenanted condition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I was chatting\r\n\r\nrecently to a young woman.  She was telling me about her\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamily.  It is a very typical Singaporean family, a family of\r\n\r\nfive  - mum, dad, two children and grandma.  Mum and dad  are\r\n\r\nboth 50, \"O\" level holders, both working.  She is a graduate,\r\n\r\nabout  to get started to work.  Her youngest sister is  about\r\n\r\n20  and is in university.  They live in a HDB apartment,  for\r\n\r\nwhich  there  is a loan, still being paid over  the  next  10\r\n\r\nyears  or so.  The family income is about $4,000-plus.   They\r\n\r\nare  a happy family and life has been very comfortable.   Dad\r\n\r\nis your true-blue solid Singaporean, very appreciative of how\r\n\r\nhe has seen life improve over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It puts a human face to the recently published Census\r\n\r\n2000  report.   The  family  sits  squarely  in  the  50-60th\r\n\r\npercentile  of average household incomes.  Mum  and  dad  are\r\n\r\nalso your typically asset rich, cash poor Singaporean couple.\r\n\r\nThere is very little in their CPF balance and they would  not\r\n\r\nbe saving very much between now and retirement.  There is not\r\n\r\nmuch left over monthly, with putting the younger daughter  to\r\n\r\nuniversity, plus some additional expenses for medication  for\r\n\r\ndad   who   had  an  angioplasty  done  a  few  months   ago.\r\n\r\nPresumably, the daughters would make some contribution to mum\r\n\r\nand  dad  after  they started working, even  after  they  get\r\n\r\nmarried and start families of their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this presumption, mum and dad's financial\r\n\r\nplanning  for  retirement rests entirely in converting  their\r\n\r\napartment  they live in into funds to see them through  their\r\n\r\nretirement  years.   In  a recent sitting  of  Parliament  in\r\n\r\nFebruary, the Minister of State, Dr John Chen, shared with us\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry  had  explored  reverse  mortgages  as  a\r\n\r\npossible source of additional income for elderly HDB  lessees\r\n\r\nfor  their  retirement needs, but had come to the  conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  not  a good idea as the monthly  returns  were\r\n\r\nmeagre and there was a risk of losing their homes at the  end\r\n\r\nof  the  term.   Dr Chen also shared that other schemes  were\r\n\r\navailable to assist elderly lessees, for example, those  with\r\n\r\n3-room  flats could sublet one or two or even the whole  flat\r\n\r\nto derive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome  income.  The last option, of course, is for the  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens to downgrade to a smaller apartment.  There was also\r\n\r\na  detailed  discussion  in  the Inter-Ministerial  Committee\r\n\r\nReport  on  the  Ageing  Population of  many  good  ideas  of\r\n\r\nbuilding more smaller flats, integrated with housing  estates\r\n\r\nfor senior citizens.  In fact, HDB has already done very good\r\n\r\nwork in developing its studio apartment scheme which, by  all\r\n\r\naccounts, has been very successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this seems like a very good proposition right now,\r\n\r\nmight  there  be  concern that when the  aging  baby  boomers\r\n\r\ndouble  and triple the numbers of over-65 a couple of decades\r\n\r\ndown  the  road, would there be too many downgraders  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket at the same time, looking to sell, and in fact,  would\r\n\r\nthe  aging  properties be able to hold their value  by  then?\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  the Minister could share with us his views  of  the\r\n\r\nscenario at that future time and what else we would  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  paying  attention to or addressing to try and  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat that scenario is a happy one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, it is in the\r\n\r\ninterest of the nation to promote family values.  It is right\r\n\r\nto  encourage  people to get married and  to  have  children.\r\n\r\nHowever, in our enthusiasm, we must also recognise the rights\r\n\r\nof  individuals to choose their future.  There will  be  some\r\n\r\nwho choose to remain single.  There will be others who end up\r\n\r\nbeing  single  after  the breakup of a  relationship.   These\r\n\r\nwould  include single parents.  Whilst we can and  should  do\r\n\r\nmore  to encourage people to form family units and to  remain\r\n\r\ntogether, some marriages would just not work out.  There  are\r\n\r\na  myriad of reasons why people would choose to remain single\r\n\r\nand why some marriages break up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a successful nation, we can and should cater for\r\n\r\nthose  who  by  choice, or by default,  are  singles.   Being\r\n\r\nsingle  does  not prevent them from being active contributing\r\n\r\ncitizens.   Some  may  even  care  more  for  Singapore  than\r\n\r\nfamilies which care only for themselves.  The most\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportant  possession for anyone must be the  roof  over  the\r\n\r\nhead.  Having a home provides the security and peace of mind.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the base from which one can function.  It is a  place\r\n\r\none  can  return to, after a hard day's work  and  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nprivacy and comfort invested in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every single would wish to live alone. Some would\r\n\r\nprefer  to  live  with  family  members  who  welcome   them.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there should be provisions for such individuals  to\r\n\r\nmake a choice, especially if he or she matters.  I hasten  to\r\n\r\nadd  that when addressing this issue, the Ministry must avoid\r\n\r\nthe  convenience of clustering units to be made available for\r\n\r\nsingles.   They  are  not infirm and do not  require  special\r\n\r\nservices.  Clustering tends to stigmatise.  Singles are  also\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  should  be  catered  for  like  any  other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Whilst it is essential that more  people  get\r\n\r\nmarried  earlier and have children, we cannot  and  must  not\r\n\r\nmarginalise the singles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I had intended to speak on the\r\n\r\nproblems  of ceiling leaks between neigbours.  But my  fellow\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleagues have already spoken in depth on this\r\n\r\nissue  and I would not repeat it.  I would, however, like  to\r\n\r\njoin  them  to  appeal  to  the HDB  to  use  its  influence,\r\n\r\nresources and power as the landlord to expedite the solutions\r\n\r\nto the problems wherever necessary and appropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John Chen Seow Phun):</b> Sir, I would first reply to Members on the\r\n\r\nproblems of spalling concrete and water leakage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, ceiling leakage usually is due to wear and tear\r\n\r\nand  natural deterioration of the water proofing membrane  on\r\n\r\nthe  toilet floor over time.  Because the ceiling is a common\r\n\r\nparty  structure, under HDB's lease agreement, the  two  flat\r\n\r\nowners, who share the structure, are jointly responsible  for\r\n\r\nits  maintenance  and repairs.  I think  Members  have  noted\r\n\r\nthat.  I want to first make clear that the responsibility  is\r\n\r\non  the lessees.  However, I want to assure Members that  the\r\n\r\nHDB will assist flat owners to resolve their problems. Flat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nowners who require assistance can approach HDB branch offices\r\n\r\nand  HDB  will help to investigate the cause of the leak  and\r\n\r\nsuggest remedial action.  HDB will also help to bring the two\r\n\r\nparties  together  and recommend suitable  contractors.   HDB\r\n\r\ncannot  take over the responsibility of repairing  the  leaks\r\n\r\nbecause  the lessees have to assume responsibility.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause the problem is due to normal wear and tear.   Let  me\r\n\r\ninform  Members that HDB build flats according to  prevailing\r\n\r\nstandards  of building control. Therefore, if there  is  poor\r\n\r\nworkmanship, the HDB will usually ask the building contractor\r\n\r\nto  make good.  But if it is due to wear and tear, then after\r\n\r\nthe  liability period of one year, the lessees would have  to\r\n\r\nassume responsibility for repair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For spalling concrete, let me correct Dr Ker that it is\r\n\r\nnot related to the salt content of the construction materials\r\n\r\nused,  but  is  a  result of a natural deterioration  process\r\n\r\ncaused  by  carbonization.   When  the  surface  concrete  is\r\n\r\ncarbonated, corrosion of the steel bars within the slabs sets\r\n\r\nin, causing the concrete surrounding the steel bars to crack.\r\n\r\nAgain, here, HDB flat owners will have to repair the spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete in their flats on their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mr Chiam's question about poor\r\n\r\nworkmanship,  as  I explained, HDB buildings  met  prevailing\r\n\r\nbuilding control standards and very likely, as the flats were\r\n\r\nbuilt  in 1984, I am sure, after so many years, deterioration\r\n\r\nwill  take place.  He mentioned about the specific cases.   I\r\n\r\nwould  ask  HDB to take another look if it is really  due  to\r\n\r\npoor workmanship.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to Dr Jennifer Lee's points. Last year, the\r\n\r\nInter-Ministerial  Committee (IMC) on the  Ageing  Population\r\n\r\nrecommended  a  policy framework to deal with the  challenges\r\n\r\nposed  by  a  greying society.  The IMC recommended  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  allow  residents to age in place.  So the  ageing  in\r\n\r\nplace  is  a  very important concept for the  future  housing\r\n\r\nneeds  of  our  elderly.   Also, the  IMC  recommended  other\r\n\r\nhousing options for the elderly and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nways  to  reinforce  financial security in  their  retirement\r\n\r\nyears.  So, to prepare for this greying population, HDB  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  incorporate elderly-friendly  features  in  the\r\n\r\ndesign  of  new  HDB  flats  and estates,  and  also  in  the\r\n\r\nupgrading of older ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee also mentioned about studio apartments that HDB\r\n\r\nhas  built.   The  studio apartment scheme  will  enable  the\r\n\r\nelderly  to  sell their existing flats and move into  smaller\r\n\r\napartments  to  generate income for their  retirement  needs.\r\n\r\nHDB  also grants the elderly who are in financial difficulty,\r\n\r\npriority  allocation to its rental flats  on  a  case-by-case\r\n\r\nbasis.  And HDB will continue to monitor the demand for these\r\n\r\nhousing  options and adjust its supply accordingly.  It  will\r\n\r\nalso continue to explore other ways to meet the housing needs\r\n\r\nof our elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me remind the Member that HDB's\r\n\r\nresponsibility  is to provide a roof over the  head  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly.   What is important is that these elderly must  also\r\n\r\ndo  active  financial  planning  during  their  golden  years\r\n\r\nbecause, if they do not, then they will have difficulties  in\r\n\r\nlater  years.   That  is why the IMC also  recommended  other\r\n\r\nfinancial  security programmes, like increasing  the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  contribution and also introducing the  Supplementary\r\n\r\nRetirement Scheme.  Coupled with the housing options provided\r\n\r\nby  the HDB, the ageing in place concept can be fulfilled  in\r\n\r\nfuture years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to Mr Gerard Ee's question about\r\n\r\nsingles.   I  would  like  to  assure  the  House  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment recognises the contribution of singles.   However,\r\n\r\nthere  are  two important considerations when we address  the\r\n\r\nhousing  policies for singles.  First, our pro-family  social\r\n\r\nframework  which  is  critical to our  social  stability  and\r\n\r\neconomic  survival  and, second, the need for  optimal  space\r\n\r\nallocation  in  land  scarce  Singapore.   Based   on   these\r\n\r\nconsiderations, we have decided to allow singles aged 35  and\r\n\r\nabove  to  buy 3-room resale flats in non-urban areas.   This\r\n\r\nwould give them a sufficiently large\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npool of flats throughout Singapore to choose from.  So it  is\r\n\r\nnot  clustering them into some areas.  All in all, there  are\r\n\r\n160,000  HDB  3-room or smaller flats that are available  for\r\n\r\nthe singles under this scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two singles aged 35 or above may also apply to buy a\r\n\r\nresale  flat  of  any flat type in any location.   To  assist\r\n\r\nsingles  in  their flat purchases, HDB provides each  single,\r\n\r\nwho is a first time flat buyer, a $11,000 CPF housing grant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rental flats, HDB has a limited stock of such flats\r\n\r\nthat  are  let  out  at subsidised rents.   These  flats  are\r\n\r\navailable only to low income families who have a greater need\r\n\r\nfor housing than singles.  Singles who wish to live in rental\r\n\r\nhousing  may sublet from HDB lessees, or pair up with another\r\n\r\nsingle to qualify for a HDB rental flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered all the questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, in speaking on this topic, I\r\n\r\nwish  to  declare  my  interest as a director  of  a  company\r\n\r\ninvolved in the construction trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the construction industry is going through\r\n\r\ndifficult times.  The Government's efforts to pump  prime  it\r\n\r\nby  stepping  up infrastructural projects and  public  sector\r\n\r\nbuilding  programmes  within the next  1-2  years  will  help\r\n\r\nrelieve   some  of  the  pressure  the  industry  is  facing.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  there will be a shake up in the  industry  and\r\n\r\nmany smaller construction companies or contractors are likely\r\n\r\nto fold up within the next 1-2 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local construction industry is made up of numerous\r\n\r\nrelatively  small to medium sized contractors, mostly  family\r\n\r\nrun  and  controlled.  There are a number of larger  publicly\r\n\r\nlisted  construction companies but, generally, they are  also\r\n\r\ncontrolled   and  run  by  families  and  a   few   principal\r\n\r\nshareholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the way forward is for the industry to\r\n\r\nquickly  consolidate,  and  the  Government  could  force   a\r\n\r\nmarriage among the construction companies.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncurrent phase of reform in the construction industry  is  too\r\n\r\nslow.   This  is  understandable, given that  many  of  these\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  owner run, and owners of different  companies\r\n\r\nhave  their  own pride and cultural differences.  This  makes\r\n\r\ntheir marriage difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Construction 21 Report, which was released in\r\n\r\nOctober 1999, calls for a revamp of the contractors' registry\r\n\r\nwith  the  aim  of  introducing more  rigorous  criteria  for\r\n\r\ncontractors'  turnover,  financial resources,  track  record,\r\n\r\nprofessional  management and so on.  These will differentiate\r\n\r\nthe   better   contractors  from  the   rest,   quicken   the\r\n\r\nconsolidation  of  the  industry, encourage  the  mergers  of\r\n\r\ncontractors  and help build a core of able local contractors,\r\n\r\nwhich  could  compete competitively for the bigger  projects,\r\n\r\nboth  locally and abroad.  I therefore urge the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nask the Building Control Authority to speed up the revamp  of\r\n\r\nthe contractors' registry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the longer term forward is for us to consciously\r\n\r\ndevelop  and  strengthen our promising local  contractors  in\r\n\r\norder  that  they could compete offshore for  projects.   Our\r\n\r\nbanks  have  expanded overseas.  Our manufacturing  companies\r\n\r\nare  penetrating overseas markets and investing abroad.   Our\r\n\r\nservice companies are also regionalising.  There is no reason\r\n\r\nwhy our construction companies cannot do the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our medium to bigger and more established\r\n\r\nconstruction  companies have good track  records.   They  are\r\n\r\ngood  in their respective fields or expertise.  Collectively,\r\n\r\nthey  can  be a force to be reckoned with, and could  compete\r\n\r\ncompetitively for projects abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to propose that we look into forming a\r\n\r\nconsortium of construction companies, which could include one\r\n\r\nor  two  GLCs,  with  the aim of exporting  our  construction\r\n\r\nexpertise  overseas  by  tapping  on  the  huge  market   for\r\n\r\ninfrastructural  projects available in our ASEAN  neighbours,\r\n\r\nIndia,  Bangladesh, Middle East and China.  Over  time,  this\r\n\r\nconsortium   of  companies  can  expand  to  be   world-class\r\n\r\ncompanies.  I would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the  Government, through the Building  Control\r\n\r\nAuthority or the Trade Development Board, conduct a study  on\r\n\r\nthe  viability  of  this  proposal in consultation  with  the\r\n\r\nindustry players, and perhaps initiate the formation of  this\r\n\r\nconsortium.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, players in\r\n\r\nthe construction industry range from entrepreneurs, builders,\r\n\r\nsuppliers,  professionals to home buyers.  I wish to  declare\r\n\r\nthat I am an architect in private practice.  My colleagues in\r\n\r\nthe  construction  industry said that  I  must  convince  the\r\n\r\nMinister that the SMEs and the construction industry continue\r\n\r\nto  suffer,  and have still not recovered.  More importantly,\r\n\r\nthere are no signs on the ground that indicate the likelihood\r\n\r\nof  recovery soon.  The four years of decline since 1997  had\r\n\r\nhurt the industry and its sustainability.  They are trying to\r\n\r\ncope.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to reduce the cost of business without\r\n\r\naffecting quality is a continuing struggle.  The reduction of\r\n\r\ntax  in  the  Budget  will help, but tax  rebates  will  only\r\n\r\nbenefit those who have made profits.  The industry is not  in\r\n\r\nthis happy state.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government agencies streamline and rationalise\r\n\r\ntheir  operations  to be more productive,  too  often,  their\r\n\r\nunproductive  works are simply passed to the private  sector.\r\n\r\nI  ask the Minister to look into operational procedures which\r\n\r\nhave  an  impact down stream.  In a downturn,  public  sector\r\n\r\nwork  is  critical to the private sector.  Of the $12 billion\r\n\r\nworks  in  the public sector, a disproportionate  volume  was\r\n\r\nundertaken  by  a Government-linked consultancy  corporation,\r\n\r\nleaving very few to private consultants.  Contracts,  on  the\r\n\r\nother hand, are being tendered and awarded at unrealistically\r\n\r\nlow prices.  This situation cannot go on without detriment to\r\n\r\nthe whole industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Construction 21 blueprint is a historical milestone\r\n\r\nfor  the  industry, as it adopts a total system  approach  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  problems of the industry.  The  consultative\r\n\r\napproach  involving  all  players in the  construction  value\r\n\r\nchain is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nespecially   significant.   Following  the  Construction   21\r\n\r\nblueprint,   the   construction  industry  joint   committee,\r\n\r\ncomprising the presidents of the various professional  bodies\r\n\r\nand   trade  associations,  was  formed  to  respond  to  the\r\n\r\nConstruction  21 initiatives.  They identified the  need  for\r\n\r\nthe  present  exploitative attitudes to be discarded,  and  a\r\n\r\ncommon  code  of conduct to be drawn up.  It  is  clear  that\r\n\r\nevery  player  has  to  act fairly, equitably  and  ethically\r\n\r\ntowards  one  another, serving the public and  their  clients\r\n\r\nwith honesty and impartiality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is becoming increasingly obvious that for the\r\n\r\nadvancement of the construction industry as a whole, and  for\r\n\r\nthe  achievement of a level of professionalism, it  is  vital\r\n\r\nthat  the  role  of  each  player in  the  industry  must  be\r\n\r\nsustainable.  I ask the Minister to support the  industry  in\r\n\r\nits endeavours and to license all parties in the construction\r\n\r\nindustry, so that a code of conduct can be enforced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultants and contractors undertaking public sector\r\n\r\nprojects  face a procurement procedure called  the  IM.   All\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies follow it faithfully, but  its  contents\r\n\r\nare  shrouded  in  mystery to the private sector.   Will  the\r\n\r\nMinister  make the IM transparent to players in the industry?\r\n\r\nIt  seems  that  the selection of consultancy  services  must\r\n\r\nfollow  a tender process, similar to buying pencils.   Surely\r\n\r\nprocuring  professional  services  cannot  follow  this  same\r\n\r\nroute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law, last week, confirmed that the\r\n\r\nGovernment will respect intellectual property rights, and yet\r\n\r\nwe  see  conditions in the procurement process requiring  all\r\n\r\ndesign  submissions to be surrendered to Government agencies.\r\n\r\nThe  design  and  build  (D&B) tender  system,  while  it  is\r\n\r\nsupported, is only one procurement method with the  intention\r\n\r\nof  bringing about an integration in the industry.  In  fact,\r\n\r\napplication  in Singapore is less than perfect  with  diverse\r\n\r\nversions  with the sole intention to passing all  risks.   In\r\n\r\nJapan,  it  has been successful because D&B tenders generally\r\n\r\ninvolve a more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsocial  conscious mindset, and only a very small  handful  of\r\n\r\ncontractors  are  invited  to participate  per  project.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  they are often negotiated contracts,  rather  than\r\n\r\ncontracts by tender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry wants to be more productive, but how can it\r\n\r\nif for some Government projects, it is not unusual to have 30\r\n\r\nteams  of  consultants  and builders  preparing  designs  and\r\n\r\ndetails  sufficiently  for pricing.  The  manpower  cost  and\r\n\r\nwastage of resources is debilitating.  As an example, in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  D&B  tender for the Defence Science  and  Technology\r\n\r\nAgency, for an expansion of a single building block, together\r\n\r\nwith some alterations and additions, 48 teams have signed  up\r\n\r\nto participate, giving an extremely conservative cost for the\r\n\r\npreparation  of  the tender at $50,000 per  team.   The  cost\r\n\r\nexpended  would be $2.4 million, when the contract  of  $3-$4\r\n\r\nmillion is 10-12 times the value of the eventual professional\r\n\r\nfees  for  the  project.  There must be  a  more  intelligent\r\n\r\nsystem  to  reduce  the  amount of wastage  of  manpower  and\r\n\r\nresources.   Perhaps  the HDB's system of pre-qualifying  not\r\n\r\nmore  than  five  teams and inviting  them  to  tender  on  a\r\n\r\nrotational  basis  could  be adopted.   Alternatively,  there\r\n\r\ncould  be  two  stages, where the first  stage  is  based  on\r\n\r\npricing of the rough order of merit where the extremely  high\r\n\r\nand   extremely  low  tenders  are  discarded,  and  only   a\r\n\r\nreasonable range of tenders in relation to the budget goes on\r\n\r\nto the next stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Government, through its champion agency, the\r\n\r\nBCA,  to  review the various D&B tender processes devised  by\r\n\r\nthe  various  agencies to optimise the use  of  valuable  and\r\n\r\nlimited  human  resources.  Otherwise, the D&B  process  will\r\n\r\nbleed  the  consultants and, eventually, it will  come  to  a\r\n\r\npoint where less effort will be invested and the country will\r\n\r\nsuffer  the poor work due to the unproductive misuse  of  D&B\r\n\r\ntenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Goh, \"guillotine\" time is at 3\r\n\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Yes, Sir, I am about to finish my\r\n\r\nspeech.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Sir, on\r\n\r\nbehalf\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  my  Minister, I want to thank all Members who have spoken\r\n\r\non behalf of the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND and BCA are both very concerned about the issues\r\n\r\nraised   and,  indeed,  we  have  been  applying  our   minds\r\n\r\nreligiously and diligently to these problems.  Mr Chew and Mr\r\n\r\nGoh  painted a rather pessimistic picture of the state of the\r\n\r\nindustry.   To  be  sure, the boom times of  the  1990s  were\r\n\r\ntemporarily over.  But the industry is consolidating and  the\r\n\r\nworse,  I think, may be over.  I have distributed a table  on\r\n\r\nthe state of the construction industry to all of you, and you\r\n\r\nwill  see from the table that the construction demand in  the\r\n\r\nyear  2000  actually grew by 42% over 1999 to $18.6  billion.\r\n\r\nSo  this  is the first sign that the worse has turned around.\r\n\r\nThe  second  indicator  is that the building  and  the  civil\r\n\r\nengineering  components  of  the  construction  demand   have\r\n\r\nactually  gone up.  Building demand, $3.8 billion last  year;\r\n\r\n$5.5  billion  forecast this year.  Civil  engineering,  $1.1\r\n\r\nbillion  last  year; $2.8 billion this year.   Insiders  will\r\n\r\nknow  that  most of the jobs generated for local  contractors\r\n\r\nand workers lie in the building and civil engineering works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew asked how fast can BCA speed up the revamp of\r\n\r\nthe  contractors' registry system.  We are working on a  fast\r\n\r\ntrack.   We  have spoken to SCAL.  We have formed a committee\r\n\r\ntogether  and we intend to firm up the register  sometime  in\r\n\r\nthe  middle  of  this year.  The register  will  tighten  the\r\n\r\nrequirements for some grades of contractors, and the idea  is\r\n\r\nto  make sure that these contractors who qualify for the best\r\n\r\ngrades are of certain size and competence.  Size is important\r\n\r\nbecause  competence is the function of size.  As Mr Chew  has\r\n\r\nrightly pointed out, banks need to merge to become bigger  to\r\n\r\ngo abroad, and so do contractors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked many questions. I am afraid I may not have\r\n\r\ntime to answer him.  But he asked several relevant ones.  One\r\n\r\nis  why  do  we  not license contractors now?   Licensing  of\r\n\r\ncontractors would be a long-term agenda.  In the short and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmedium-term,   we  would  like  to  revamp  the  contractors'\r\n\r\nregistry  system  to  make sure that our contractors  are  of\r\n\r\ncertain  size and with certain competence.  As it is now,  it\r\n\r\nis  impossible  to enforce licensing requirements  because  a\r\n\r\nlicensed contractor can always sub-contract his or her job to\r\n\r\nunlicensed contractors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we judge BCA's performance? BCA is both a\r\n\r\nregulator  as well as a promoter.  As a regulator, you  judge\r\n\r\nBCA's  performance by the buildings in Singapore.   Are  they\r\n\r\nsafe  or  not?  The answer must be a \"yes\".  BCA  is  also  a\r\n\r\npromoter.   So  BCA promotes the industry.  It is  trying  to\r\n\r\nrevamp the industry.  It also tries to educate consumers.  It\r\n\r\nis  working  with  CASE  to raise awareness  on  the  quality\r\n\r\nconsciousness.  It has implemented over the years the CONQUAS\r\n\r\nscore,  which is the national benchmark on quality, and  this\r\n\r\nCONQUAS score is available on BCA's website.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the Government helping contractors? There are\r\n\r\nmany schemes.  Government is providing a $10 million R&D Fund\r\n\r\nand  a $10 million Industry Productivity Fund.  There is  the\r\n\r\nexisting Local Enterprises Technical Assistance Scheme  which\r\n\r\ncontractors  are already tapping into.  There  are  also  the\r\n\r\nexisting   Trade  Development  Board  Scheme  and  Investment\r\n\r\nAllowance Scheme.  All these schemes are being tapped by  the\r\n\r\ncontractors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tender prices - this is a perennial complaint. Dr Teo\r\n\r\nand Mr Goh Chong Chia have raised it.  Government tenders are\r\n\r\nnot  awarded solely on price.  Price is one of the  criteria.\r\n\r\nIt  is an important criterion.  It is not the only criterion.\r\n\r\nMany   contracts  over  the  years  have  been   awarded   to\r\n\r\ncontractors  who  did not submit the lowest tender.   Because\r\n\r\nmany  contracting  jobs  are  prequalified,  contractors  who\r\n\r\nsubmit their tenders are judged on a level playing field, and\r\n\r\nprice  becomes an important selection criterion.  On  Mr  Goh\r\n\r\nChong Chia's question on whether the IM procedure can be made\r\n\r\npublic,  I  will  raise  this concern with  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance, which is in charge of IM procedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the questions which I do not have time to answer, I\r\n\r\nwill ask my staff to reply to Members directly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, the question I really have is\r\n\r\nthis.   While  it  is  very  encouraging  to  see  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has started this scheme late last year,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask whether, in addition to looking at the priority\r\n\r\nfor  older  estates,  there are wards where  there  are  more\r\n\r\nprivate  estates than public estates.  Can there  be  greater\r\n\r\npriority given to the many residents who have been supporting\r\n\r\nthe Government?  The two MPs, who are raising this topic, are\r\n\r\nfrom Kreta Ayer-Tanglin GRC, and we know that there are a lot\r\n\r\nmore  private estates there.  I hope that the Government  can\r\n\r\nconsider upgrading the flats in this GRC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, I would like to add my call again\r\n\r\nfor  more funds to be set aside for the upgrading of  private\r\n\r\nhousing estates and for this programme to be expedited.  Last\r\n\r\nyear, only five lucky estates were selected.  There are  many\r\n\r\nmore  old  estates  that could do with  a  comprehensive  and\r\n\r\nsystematic upgrading programme.  As the construction industry\r\n\r\nhas  been  in  a  slump for a number of  years  now,  perhaps\r\n\r\nbringing  forward  some of these upgrading  programmes  would\r\n\r\nalso help to boost the construction sector and save money for\r\n\r\nthe Government, as the cost will be lower too.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Singapore has made a name for itself as\r\n\r\nthe ornamental fish capital of the world with a 30% share  of\r\n\r\nthe  international market.  Singapore is the largest exporter\r\n\r\nof  ornamental fish.  The total export value of such fish  is\r\n\r\nabout $76 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore, I was a bit surprised that in the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times, there was a report of the Government clearing\r\n\r\nup  many of these fish farms which are in the outlying areas.\r\n\r\nThe  report concerns 36 fish farms in Fish Farm Road 1, 2 and\r\n\r\n3  of  Old Tampines Road.  My fear is that with resettlement,\r\n\r\nthese ornamental fish farms may be bogged down by heavy costs\r\n\r\nwhen they are resettled in agrotechnology parks and they  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  able to survive.  My concern is whether or  not  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  slow down on this resettlement  and  give\r\n\r\nthem a chance to survive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, Mr Chiam is right that we\r\n\r\nwant  to  promote  the  export of ornamental  fish.

The farms that he mentioned were  being\r\n\r\nrelocated  from  Tampines because  the  land  there  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired  for industrial development.

I have two suggestions\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich will make this housing scheme more accessible and  more\r\n\r\nequitable for all elderly Singaporeans.  Removal of  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  conditions will also help HDB to improve the success  of\r\n\r\nthe scheme which I understand has not been great.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an ageing population, the HDB's studio apartment\r\n\r\nscheme is an appropriate measure to alleviate the need of the\r\n\r\nelderly  for  suitable  housing.   However,  some  of   HDB's\r\n\r\nexisting  rules  and  regulations are,  in  my  opinion,  too\r\n\r\nrestrictive  and  unfair, and therefore  defeat  the  desired\r\n\r\nobjectives of the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind, the two objectives of the scheme should be\r\n\r\nas follows:  First, to build appropriate housing with special\r\n\r\namenities for the elderly.  Second, to enable the elderly  to\r\n\r\nlive  independently  while remaining in  close  proximity  to\r\n\r\nother family members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these objectives in mind, the HDB should reconsider\r\n\r\nthe condition of sale that only existing HDB lessees who have\r\n\r\nlived  in their flats for at least 10 years are eligible  for\r\n\r\nstudio  apartments under the scheme.  This regulation assumes\r\n\r\nthat  all  elderly  Singaporeans, who are not  currently  HDB\r\n\r\nlessees, will always have the financial means to afford  non-governmental housing.  This is incorrect.  Circumstances  can\r\n\r\nchange  for  anyone.   Even  if  the  issue  of  finances  is\r\n\r\ndiscounted,  let us not forget that some elderly persons  may\r\n\r\nchoose to live among other elderly persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of many elderly Singaporeans who, because of\r\n\r\nchanging  circumstances,  are  in  need  of  more  economical\r\n\r\nhousing.   For example, one can imagine the situation  of  an\r\n\r\nelderly  couple that has lived with their children in private\r\n\r\nproperty.   They themselves are not rich.  Such a couple  may\r\n\r\nbe  forced to look for alternative accommodation as a  result\r\n\r\nof  problems within the family or relocation of the  children\r\n\r\noverseas, whether for work or through immigration.   The  HDB\r\n\r\nstudio  apartment  could  be  the only  financially  feasible\r\n\r\noption for the couple - but the existing HDB regulation makes\r\n\r\nthem  ineligible.  Or an elderly couple may need to downgrade\r\n\r\nto a smaller,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  economical  property as a result of  a  change  in  its\r\n\r\nfinancial situation.  Let us also not forget that the elderly\r\n\r\ngenerally require more amenities - amenities which the studio\r\n\r\napartments  are especially designed to cater  for.   Finally,\r\n\r\nliving among other elderly persons can enhance the quality of\r\n\r\nlife for many elderly citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasise again that an important objective of\r\n\r\nthe   scheme   is   to  provide  housing  for   all   elderly\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, and not just elderly HDB lessees.  For all  the\r\n\r\nreasons  I mentioned above, elderly Singaporeans who are  not\r\n\r\nexisting HDB lessees should not be excluded from the  scheme.\r\n\r\nI therefore strongly urge the HDB to reconsider the condition\r\n\r\nthat  makes only existing HDB lessees who have lived in their\r\n\r\nflats  for  at least 10 years eligible for this scheme.   All\r\n\r\nelderly Singaporeans should be eligible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion to improve the scheme relates to\r\n\r\nthe  conditions that the owner is prohibited from selling the\r\n\r\nstudio  apartment  in the resale market.  I  am  recommending\r\n\r\nthat this condition be reviewed for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wan, \"guillotine\" time on this\r\n\r\namendment is 3.12 pm.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Yes, Sir. This condition restricts\r\n\r\nthe  mobility  of  owners  and  consequently  undermines  the\r\n\r\nobjective  of  the  HDB elderly housing scheme  to  encourage\r\n\r\nelderly  Singaporeans  to  live near  their  families,  while\r\n\r\nallowing  them  to  maintain a degree of  independence.   For\r\n\r\nexample, what happens when an elderly couple's children  move\r\n\r\nto  a different location?  While it would make sense for  the\r\n\r\nelderly  couple to sell their present unit and to buy another\r\n\r\nto  be  closer to the family, the current HDB condition  only\r\n\r\nallows owners to sell apartments back to the HDB.  This  will\r\n\r\ntotally  deter people from selling and therefore  limits  the\r\n\r\nmobility and flexibility of the elderly owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing the sale of the studio apartments in the resale\r\n\r\nmarket will provide an alternative to potential buyers in the\r\n\r\nqueue, similar to the circumstances\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexisting in the general HDB flats resale market.  I certainly\r\n\r\nappreciate that precautionary measures are needed to  prevent\r\n\r\nspeculative  purchases.  But since the  scheme  is  available\r\n\r\nonly  to those aged 55 and above, it is highly unlikely  that\r\n\r\nthose  who  apply for these studio apartments are  purchasing\r\n\r\nthe  flats for profit.  Furthermore, there are already  other\r\n\r\nrestrictions for purchase, such as non-ownership  of  private\r\n\r\nproperty  and  a  household income ceiling  of  $8,000  which\r\n\r\nprovide sufficient protection against speculative buying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the other HDB restrictions governing eligibility\r\n\r\nfor  housing under the scheme and the fact that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nlimited  pool  of potential buyers, the danger of  widespread\r\n\r\nspeculation in these studio apartments is, I believe,  highly\r\n\r\nexaggerated.   The studio apartments scheme is  an  excellent\r\n\r\nhousing  scheme  for the elderly.  All of  our  elderly  have\r\n\r\ncontributed  to  the  success  of  our  nation,  let  us  not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate amongst them, but instead ensure that  each  and\r\n\r\nevery  elderly  Singaporean can enjoy the  benefits  of  this\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I proceed to the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will ask Dr John Chen to respond to you\r\n\r\nand if there is time, you can then move on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, my response will be\r\n\r\nshorter than his.  As my Minister mentioned earlier, he  will\r\n\r\nask  HDB  to  review  the  eligibility  criteria  for  studio\r\n\r\napartments.  The review would take into account the  Member's\r\n\r\nsuggestion to allow other categories of the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on his second point, I would like to point out that\r\n\r\nthe  studio apartments are sold on a 30-year lease.  HDB will\r\n\r\ngive  studio apartment residents who wish to move out  before\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the  lease  period a pro-rated  refund  of  the\r\n\r\npurchase  price.   However,  they cannot  sell  their  studio\r\n\r\napartments  on  the  open  market.   This  restriction  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessary  condition for the discounted land rate  of  studio\r\n\r\napartment  sites.   If this restriction is removed,  the  HDB\r\n\r\nwould have to pay a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmuch  higher land rate for the studio apartment sites,  which\r\n\r\nwill translate into more expensive studio apartments for  the\r\n\r\nelderly.  So, to answer Dr Wan, the elderly can return  their\r\n\r\nflats  to  HDB and they will get a pro-rated refund and  they\r\n\r\ncan move to elsewhere if they like to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wan, there are three minutes left.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, one of the conditions for the\r\n\r\npurchase  of  new  HDB  flats is that the  household  monthly\r\n\r\nincome must not exceed $8,000.  This condition does not apply\r\n\r\nto the purchase of HDB flats in the resale market.  I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  HDB  review this condition in the light of the changing\r\n\r\nexpectations of the citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rising affluence, Singaporeans are demanding better\r\n\r\nquality  housing and, indeed, HDB has also changed  its  role\r\n\r\nfrom one that provides subsidised housing to the lower income\r\n\r\ngroup  to  one  that  provides affordable  yet  high  quality\r\n\r\nhousing to Singaporeans in general.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale of restricting the purchase of new flats\r\n\r\nto  households with a certain level of income is outdated and\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be re-examined.  Some Singaporeans whose household\r\n\r\nincomes  exceed  the  ceiling  may  nevertheless  prefer   to\r\n\r\npurchase   HDB  flat  instead  of  private  property.    Such\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should not be penalised by being forced to buy a\r\n\r\nprivate  property,  where  prices  are  prohibitive  and  the\r\n\r\nquality may even be inferior to that of an HDB flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that, generally, Singaporeans who can\r\n\r\ncomfortably  afford  a good private property  would  tend  to\r\n\r\nprefer  a private property.  Therefore, I believe that  there\r\n\r\nis  relatively little danger that people with higher  incomes\r\n\r\nwould queue to acquire an HDB flat unless they have some good\r\n\r\nreasons  to  do  so.   Further,  if  we  believe  that  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean   matters,  then  even  though  HDB   flats   are\r\n\r\nsubsidised, we should not discriminate between citizens  with\r\n\r\ndifferent  household  incomes.  If HDB  strongly  feels  that\r\n\r\nthere  should still be an income ceiling, then  at  least  it\r\n\r\nshould review it periodically as the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprofile of household incomes changes over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, HDB imposes an income\r\n\r\nceiling  because HDB flats are heavily subsidised.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmeans to allow Singaporeans who cannot afford private housing\r\n\r\nto  also become home owners.  The household income ceiling of\r\n\r\n$8,000  per  month  for the purchase  of  new  HDB  flats  is\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  the  88th  household  income  percentile   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   In  other words, nine out of  10  Singaporean\r\n\r\nhouseholds  are eligible to buy a subsidised flat  from  HDB.\r\n\r\nThe  top  10% of Singaporeans who can afford private  housing\r\n\r\nand  wish to live in public housing can buy resale HDB flats.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if they start young, they probably would qualify\r\n\r\nfor  HDB  flats  because their salaries would be  lower  and,\r\n\r\nlater  on,  they can upgrade.  So, in practice, almost  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean can buy a HDB flat if they know how.   Also,  the\r\n\r\nlast review was in 1996, just before the crisis.  And we have\r\n\r\nnot  even  gone  back to the pre-crisis level,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nproperty  prices.   Nevertheless,  HDB  reviews  the   income\r\n\r\nceiling  to purchase subsidised flats from time to time.   At\r\n\r\nthe moment, HDB has no plan to raise the income ceiling.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wan, can you withdraw your amendment,\r\n\r\nplease?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> I would like to thank the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  for the answer, although I am not satisfied with  what\r\n\r\nhe  has  said because these are standard answers  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen given to us year after year.

As a result, we have built  Singapore\r\n\r\ninto a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan  city  with  vibrant activities  in  an  orderly\r\n\r\nmanner.   With the emergence of the electronic age, the  time\r\n\r\nhas  come to take a review of the existing planning rules and\r\n\r\nregulations  to  see  whether some  of  these  rules  can  be\r\n\r\nmodified  to suit the needs of the new era.  It is heartening\r\n\r\nto  note  that URA has now designated more white sites  which\r\n\r\nallow  flexibility  in the land use.  URA  has  also  allowed\r\n\r\nresidences  to  be used as home offices for specific  trades,\r\n\r\nsuch as electronic and Internet-related business.  There  are\r\n\r\nhowever some other areas which warrant our attention.  I note\r\n\r\nfrom  the recent trend that the vacancy ratio of office space\r\n\r\nin  the  town  area  has declined and the office  rental  has\r\n\r\nrisen.   It is difficult for small and medium-sized companies\r\n\r\nto  pay high rentals, and there are not many office buildings\r\n\r\nin  the  fringe  areas.   Many have,  therefore,  moved  into\r\n\r\nindustrial buildings in various industrial estates.  However,\r\n\r\nthere  are  restrictions  on  the  maximum  area  within   an\r\n\r\nindustrial  building which can be used as  an  office.   Even\r\n\r\nwithin  each  unit  in  an industrial building,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nrestriction  that  the area used as an office  cannot  exceed\r\n\r\n40%.   These  restrictions make it difficult  for  small  and\r\n\r\nmedium-sized companies to be housed in industrial buildings.\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same spirit that URA allows home offices to be\r\n\r\nset  up in residence, I would like to appeal to URA to  relax\r\n\r\nits  restrictions  and allow industrial  space,  particularly\r\n\r\nlight  industrial  space, to be used  as  offices.   In  this\r\n\r\nconnection,  I  would like to declare my interest  that  some\r\n\r\ncompanies, within the group which I am associated  with,  are\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the  development of industrial  properties.   I\r\n\r\nwould  still  appeal to URA to consider allowing  more  space\r\n\r\nwithin each industrial unit to be used as offices.  It should\r\n\r\nalso  consider allowing certain floors within existing  light\r\n\r\nindustrial  buildings to be used as offices.  The  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  some of the activities, which are classified  as  light\r\n\r\nindustry,  such as research and training, are fairly  similar\r\n\r\nto  office activities.  In fact, the inclusion of offices  in\r\n\r\nlight industrial buildings will not cause inconvenience\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  the  existing  industrial users.  It will  alleviate  the\r\n\r\npressure on the demand for office space in the town area, and\r\n\r\nenable  small  and  medium-sized companies  to  reduce  their\r\n\r\nbusiness costs.  This is essential for their survival in  the\r\n\r\nyears of economic uncertainty ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ker, would you like to allow time for\r\n\r\nthe others?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> All right, Sir. As a fine tuning to\r\n\r\nsatisfy the long-term need, the Minister may wish to consider\r\n\r\nreplacing the existing category of light industry  use  by  a\r\n\r\nnew category of a combined light industry and office use.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, arising from the case of polluted\r\n\r\ndrinking water at Bukit Timah Plaza, I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nrelevant authorities if there are plans to set standards  for\r\n\r\nproperty  management, apart from looking into the  issues  of\r\n\r\nthe responsibilities of the parties, as spelt out in the Land\r\n\r\nTitles Strata Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As buildings age, problems resulting from poor\r\n\r\nmaintenance and management will increase.  Although there are\r\n\r\nstatutory  regulations that building owners  must  abide  by,\r\n\r\nthere is currently no legislation to ensure that the managers\r\n\r\nlooking   after  the  buildings  need  minimum   professional\r\n\r\nstandards.   Just as there are controls on the  professionals\r\n\r\ninvolved in the construction of a building, there is  also  a\r\n\r\nneed  to ensure that there are controls on professionals  who\r\n\r\nmanage  buildings.   I  would  therefore  urge  the  relevant\r\n\r\nauthorities  to  look  into  the control  and  regulation  of\r\n\r\nproperty managers, to whom we entrust the safety and security\r\n\r\nof our buildings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The CC is an important institution  in  the\r\n\r\nconstituency.   It  allows  different  races  with  different\r\n\r\nreligious  beliefs  to interact and socialise.   The  CC  is,\r\n\r\nthus, the common ground for all.  A big field fronting a  CC,\r\n\r\nI believe, is the best setting.  In the evening, children and\r\n\r\nfamilies can enjoy the open space and, more rewarding,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure the CC activities will attract more residents to attend.\r\n\r\nNational  Day  can be celebrated on a grander  scale  at  our\r\n\r\nconstituency  level.

Judging from the current state of sports\r\n\r\nin Singapore, it is obvious that we have still some way to go\r\n\r\nbefore we even come close to achieving these objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think that there is lack of political will\r\n\r\nto  give  sports  a  higher profile  and  more  attention  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  MCD was re-designated as MCDS in April last  year\r\n\r\nand  the  Committee  on Sporting Singapore,  chaired  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Community Development and Sports, was formed  in\r\n\r\nSeptember   last  year  to  review  sporting   policies   and\r\n\r\nprogrammes, and to chart the future of sports in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Committee, comprising several Ministers, released\r\n\r\nits  wide  ranging interim recommendations in  February  this\r\n\r\nyear  at  a  public forum.  Many suggestions  were  also  put\r\n\r\nforward  at the forum by the sporting fraternity and  members\r\n\r\nof the public. The recommendations and suggestions, excellent\r\n\r\nas  they  are, cannot really succeed if there is  no  mindset\r\n\r\nchange  among  our  population,  especially  parents  towards\r\n\r\nsports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports School, for example, is a marvellous\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to nurture our young, the sporting  potential\r\n\r\nto  become regional, if not, world-class athletes.   However,\r\n\r\nthis  facility will become a white elephant if there were  no\r\n\r\nmindset  change of parents towards their children's education\r\n\r\nand the mere obsession for academic achievement.  In order to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  this  mindset  change among  parents  and  school\r\n\r\nchildren  towards  sports, I would like to  request  MCDS  to\r\n\r\nconsider introducing sports excellence, sports merit and good\r\n\r\nprogress awards, similar to the Edusave Scholarship Merit and\r\n\r\nGPA   Awards,  given  to  citizens  each  year  for  academic\r\n\r\nperformance.  The proposed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsports  awards may convince students and parents  that  equal\r\n\r\nrecognition  can be achieved for performance  in  sports,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  in their studies.  MOE should also be persuaded  to\r\n\r\nmake  it  easier  for promising athletes  to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\ndemands of their sports and their studies by committing  them\r\n\r\na  longer timeframe to complete their studies and also  time-off   to  prepare  for  major  competitions.   Students  with\r\n\r\noutstanding achievements in sports could perhaps be permitted\r\n\r\nto  combine their \"O\" or \"A\" grades obtained at more than one\r\n\r\nsitting for advancement into institutions of higher learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sporting excellence in many sports also requires\r\n\r\nathletes' involvement in regular and sustained training, even\r\n\r\nafter  they  leave  school  and  join  the  workforce.   Many\r\n\r\nemployers  must  also  change  their  attitudes  towards  the\r\n\r\nemployees  who are sportsmen.  In order to help  bring  about\r\n\r\nthis  change,  could MCDS consider including  a  make-up  pay\r\n\r\nsystem for our best and most promising athletes whenever they\r\n\r\nare  required  to  be  away from work  for  sports  training,\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  the  NS  make-up pay  that  MINDEF  provides  to\r\n\r\nemployers with NSmen employees?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our promising sportsmen also experience\r\n\r\ndisruptions  in  their  training  schedules  when  they   are\r\n\r\nenlisted for National Service.  While national security is of\r\n\r\nvital  importance  and  must take precedence,  MINDEF  should\r\n\r\nexercise flexibility, wherever possible, to release sportsmen\r\n\r\nwho are non-key appointment holders for sports training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to urge MCDS and the Committee on\r\n\r\nSporting  Singapore, when formulating our sports  policy,  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  measures and concentrate its efforts to facilitate\r\n\r\nthese  mindset changes in order that sports would finally  be\r\n\r\nrecognised as the main stream pursued by Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the\r\n\r\ndebate.  Sir, have we run out of steam in producing sportsmen\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsportswomen to increase our medal tally in the SEA and  Asian\r\n\r\ngames?  I hope not, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on records, we have not produced respectable\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  champions in the last 10 years.   Gone  are  the\r\n\r\nheydays  when we hear of household names such as  C  Kunalan,\r\n\r\nJayamani, Ang Peng Siong, Patricia Chan and others.   We  are\r\n\r\nso lean now that we also have to import sporting talents.  Is\r\n\r\nthe Ministry actively scouting for talents from outside? What\r\n\r\nwould be the outcomes of the sports schools that we have  set\r\n\r\nup  which are supposed to nurture local talents?  Are  public\r\n\r\nfunds for promotion of sports effectively used?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have another point. In order that we can bring\r\n\r\nmore   innovations  to  promote  sports,  what   new   policy\r\n\r\ndirections and targets are being set by the Ministry?  May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest, for a start, that we invite various capable sporting\r\n\r\nassociations   and  country  clubs  to  manage   our   sports\r\n\r\ncomplexes,  obviously with grants from  the  Ministry?   This\r\n\r\nwill  bring more innovations and competition in the promotion\r\n\r\nof sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, many countries in the\r\n\r\nworld know the value of sporting champions to bond the nation\r\n\r\ntogether,  to bring glory to the nation.  In many  countries,\r\n\r\nthere   are  sports  ministries  which  actively   fund   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  sports.  Until recently, Singapore  did  not\r\n\r\nhave such.  And now that we have a Sports Minister, we can re-look at some of the policies that we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of sports in drawing people together\r\n\r\ncannot  be  too little emphasised.  The policy that Singapore\r\n\r\nhad  in the past has been Sports for All, let everybody enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  sports, and it is a rather lukewarm programme.  It is  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  like  a  bus  going up  Fraser's  Hill.   It  goes\r\n\r\nputtering on slowly.  We know that it will get somewhere,  we\r\n\r\njust do not know when.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important for us now to look at some of the\r\n\r\nways  of  grooming champions so that we can inspire  a  whole\r\n\r\ngeneration  of youths to bond together to say,  \"This  is  my\r\n\r\nnation.  I am proud of it.\"  Sports, of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncourse, is just one of those many things that we can do to do\r\n\r\nthis.    For  example,  we  have  got  some  very  attractive\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to encourage champions to be involved in  sports.\r\n\r\nWe  give  a million dollars, for example, if we can  have  an\r\n\r\nOlympic  champion.  Unfortunately, we are  doing  it  wrongly\r\n\r\nbecause we are giving a million dollars' reward to the person\r\n\r\nafter  he wins an Olympic medal. The correct approach  should\r\n\r\nbe   to  take  that  one  million  dollars  and  develop  the\r\n\r\npotentials that we spot until they become champions.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nafter  that, if we still want to reward them, that is another\r\n\r\nstory.  If we do not develop these champions over a number of\r\n\r\nyears  and  we leave them to struggle until they accidentally\r\n\r\nbecome champions, this is not the correct approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most focused ways of doing something will be\r\n\r\nto set up a national school for sports.  My daughter has been\r\n\r\nselected  to run track and field in her school. She does  not\r\n\r\ndo  it for a profession.  It is just a co-curricular activity\r\n\r\nbut  she  has to spend four days a week running and training,\r\n\r\nbecause nationals are coming up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, we have to realise that people, like my\r\n\r\ndaughter, do not need to do this as a profession.  They do it\r\n\r\nin  a less intensive way.  But for those who are spotted, and\r\n\r\nare  real  talents, they should then be put  into  a  special\r\n\r\nschool where they can do both their studies and sports  in  a\r\n\r\nbalanced way.  Otherwise, they would end up like my daughter,\r\n\r\ntoo tired to do her studies when national training is on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is to draw people together. We can have\r\n\r\na  new national stadium that people can be proud of, that  is\r\n\r\nnot  something that we are ashamed to boast about because  it\r\n\r\nis  grey,  and  greying even more.  When  we  have  a  status\r\n\r\nsymbol, an icon that all can aim for, we can then both do the\r\n\r\nsports  for all programme; and a programme for those who  are\r\n\r\ninspired and have great dreams to be the Michael Jordans  and\r\n\r\nbe  the  great stars of track and field that we want them  to\r\n\r\naspire to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than importing talent, we should also be\r\n\r\ndeveloping  our  local  talent.  I do, however,  support  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  import talents and I hope  that  the  Ministry\r\n\r\ncould  do it more proactively by going out into the world  to\r\n\r\nlook  for  the talents and bringing them or their parents  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, both the press and\r\n\r\nMCDS  reports have highlighted the fact that we are committed\r\n\r\nto  the  effort  of  building up Singapore  as  a  nation  of\r\n\r\nexcellence  in  sports.  MCDS has also laid down  a  goal  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up Singapore as one of the sporting hubs in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  very  challenging objective, but  with  concrete\r\n\r\nmeasures, we can achieve this goal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, there is room for enhancing and developing many\r\n\r\nsports  events in Singapore, be it individual or group event.\r\n\r\nI  myself am the President of the Volleyball Association  and\r\n\r\nthe Wushu Association. I would like to touch on three points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, manpower and finance. Before formulating a\r\n\r\nnational  goal in sports, the Government should discuss  with\r\n\r\nthe  various sports organisations to formulate plans to train\r\n\r\nour  national  team.   Presently, all the  officials  in  the\r\n\r\nNational Sports Associations are volunteers and they spend  a\r\n\r\nlot of  time in fund-raising activities rather than promoting\r\n\r\nsports.    All  these  sportsmen  are  voluntary  and   these\r\n\r\norganisations  have  spent a lot of time  in  raising  funds.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  at  the  same  time, the Government  should  also\r\n\r\nprovide them with financial assistance.  The funding could be\r\n\r\nin the ratio of 1:1 or 1:2.  We should give them enough funds\r\n\r\nif  we want them to perform well.  With enough funding,  they\r\n\r\nwould perform better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, MCDS intends to set up a sports institute in\r\n\r\n2003.   This is a good idea but before embarking on this,  we\r\n\r\nshould  provide  a  site  of software  for  the  training  of\r\n\r\nsportsmen  and sportswomen so that their potential  could  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped to their fullest.  Is the Singapore Sports  Council\r\n\r\nin  a  position to select people with potential for  training\r\n\r\nand award the scholarships for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntraining  in foreign countries?  Our local training  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able to achieve this purpose because our sportsmen have\r\n\r\nto  go  to school at the same time when they go for training.\r\n\r\nThey  should  be  awarded  the scholarship  for  training  in\r\n\r\nforeign  countries, for example, PM hopes that by  2008, our\r\n\r\nfootball team will be able to go into the World Cup.\r\n\r\nPromising players should be sent to Brazil and other\r\n\r\ncountries for training.  I believe when they come back in two\r\n\r\nyears' time, we will be able to achieve such a purpose.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  Japan  accepts  full-time training  for  volleyball\r\n\r\nplayers.   I have seen their training in Japan.  It is  full-time  training.   If our volleyball players  could  be  given\r\n\r\nopportunities to train in Japan, they will perform better and\r\n\r\nwin honour for our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on career prospects of professional sportsmen\r\n\r\nand women.  Most parents would like their children to take up\r\n\r\na  lucrative profession. Hence, we should change the  mindset\r\n\r\nof  parents that sports is not a perishing profession.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, in US, Australia and other  countries,  the\r\n\r\nsports  profession is a very lucrative one.  What a sportsman\r\n\r\nearns  is  not  inferior to that of any other profession.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to urge the Government to assure the parents  that\r\n\r\nthe  sports  profession  has a future  and  that  sportsmen's\r\n\r\ncareer is taken care of.  Therefore, we have to change  their\r\n\r\nmindsets.   MCDS  can also plan for this to ensure  that  our\r\n\r\nsportsmen,  especially our national team players, after  they\r\n\r\nhave contributed to the nation, could carry on as instructors\r\n\r\nin  schools  or in training up our national teams.   We  will\r\n\r\nbetter develop  our sport programmes.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Sir, our talent pool needs to be\r\n\r\neducated  and trained in order to sustain a sound  workforce,\r\n\r\nto support the growth we have experienced over the past three\r\n\r\ndecades.  We understand from the Budget Speech 2001 that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is investing significantly in education, training,\r\n\r\ninvestment schemes,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nendowment  funds,  etc.  The flipside of  this  must  be  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  a physically sound and a healthy  workforce,\r\n\r\nbecause  the workforce is only as productive as its state  of\r\n\r\nhealth.   It  is  scientifically established  that  the  only\r\n\r\nmechanism  to  ensure healthy and good quality  life  in  the\r\n\r\nlabour  force is through life-long physical exercise regimes.\r\n\r\nThe  setting up of the Health Promotion Board is timely.  The\r\n\r\nMCDS'  policy  to  promote the development  of  the  physical\r\n\r\nhealth  of the school children will ensure that people  carry\r\n\r\non a healthy lifestyle throughout their work life and even in\r\n\r\ntheir later years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports could be developed at several levels. (1)\r\n\r\nSports   as  a  lifestyle  to  ensure  a  healthy  population\r\n\r\nthroughout  life.  In schools, sports must  be  developed  as\r\n\r\npart  of  curriculum activities in parallel with the critical\r\n\r\nacademic curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Sports as a recreation and means of community\r\n\r\ndevelopment to ensure social bonding, allegiance and loyalty.\r\n\r\nMr  Minister, you encourage us each time we see you  in  your\r\n\r\nrunning shorts and shoes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Sports with the aim of allowing individuals to set\r\n\r\ntheir  own challenges and goals.  We remember the folk heroes\r\n\r\nlike Wong Peng Soon of Thomas Cup fame,  Khoo Swee Chiow  who\r\n\r\nreached  the summit of Mount Everest and Singapore's plan  to\r\n\r\nattain  a position in the World Cup.   However, we have  also\r\n\r\nfailed  to  honour  Tan Howe Liang, our only  Olympic  silver\r\n\r\nmedallist.   Ronald Soo got to the All-England quarter finals\r\n\r\nrecently.   No Singaporean had achieved this in two  decades.\r\n\r\nWill we forget him now that he is not in the semi finals?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read in the newspaper recently on a question put to a\r\n\r\nforeign  Olympics  medallist.  He was asked  whether  he  was\r\n\r\nrewarded  a  million dollars after he won the  Olympics  gold\r\n\r\nmedal.   He was puzzled but after some explanation,  he  said\r\n\r\nthat  he  would have preferred to have the financial  support\r\n\r\nbefore he won, and not after.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Sports as a career path. We must encourage people\r\n\r\nwith  sporting skills to excel.  A career path in sports must\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntreated  as equal to academic skills.  I would like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  Minister's  policy  towards  a  holistic   and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  approach  to  health  and  sports.   Will  the\r\n\r\nMinister  set  up  one  or  more  focus  groups  to   collect\r\n\r\ninformation,  analyse  data and come up  with  plans  on  two\r\n\r\nlevels?   First,  the software plans for the  development  of\r\n\r\nhuman  capital,  education, health and sports.   Second,  the\r\n\r\nhardware  plans,  inclusive  of feasibility  studies,  design\r\n\r\nbriefs,  master  plans  and plans for the  development  of  a\r\n\r\nsports   hub.   We  need  better  and  world-class   sporting\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as an architect in private practice, I cannot\r\n\r\nhelp  but  want to ask the Minister whether he will agree  to\r\n\r\norganise a national design competition to tap the best  ideas\r\n\r\nfor the new stadium and sports hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I mentioned earlier the\r\n\r\nneed  for both a Sports for Champions programme and a  Sports\r\n\r\nfor  All  programme.   I mentioned that our  Sports  for  All\r\n\r\nprogramme is rather lukewarm at the moment.  The reason I say\r\n\r\nthis is that we are not doing enough to provide facilities in\r\n\r\nevery community.  One of the reasons that American kids,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  grow up aspiring to be Michael Jordan is that  they\r\n\r\ncan  find  in schools and in their communities, even  outside\r\n\r\nschools, facilities to play their games.  Sometimes  even  on\r\n\r\nthe streets, because they are so keen to play games that they\r\n\r\nform  their own three against three teams and play  games  in\r\n\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now doing this, Sir. Increasingly, we are\r\n\r\nbuilding street soccer and street basketball pitches,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should do more of this.  Because,  ultimately,  if\r\n\r\npeople are aspiring to be Michael Jordans, Shaquille O'Neals,\r\n\r\nFandis and Peles, we must give them facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the national development debate that has just\r\n\r\nterminated, there was this indication that schools and  other\r\n\r\nfacilities  could be open to the youths of the community.   I\r\n\r\nknow the Ministry of Education, in fact, has asked principals\r\n\r\nto  encourage this.  But not every principal is able to do it\r\n\r\nbecause sometimes they are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconcerned about the security of the schools, and the ultimate\r\n\r\ndecision  of  opening up the school field is  really  at  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion of the principal.  In the end, it is too much of a\r\n\r\ntrouble  sometimes for people to use the school  field.   And\r\n\r\nyet  we  have  got patches of land all over which  are  being\r\n\r\nreserved  for future use, and the land sits there  for  years\r\n\r\nand  years and nobody is using them.  And when the grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  ask for these fields, they are charged  market\r\n\r\nrent.  If a grassroots organisation applies for it, they only\r\n\r\npay  30%  of  the market price.  And I am asking whether  the\r\n\r\nMCDS  could consider either helping to pay for this or  fully\r\n\r\nsubsidise  the  rental, so that the grassroots  organisations\r\n\r\ncan  indeed build facilities for the community.  Just looking\r\n\r\nat  the  fields  near my place, levelling  them,  putting  up\r\n\r\nfences, it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars - not to\r\n\r\nmention  the  TOL fees that we have to pay  later.   I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  urge  the Minister to consider ways  of  releasing\r\n\r\nfunds  to  help  the  communities build more  facilities  for\r\n\r\nsports.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  a very simple request and appeal to the Minister.  When\r\n\r\nwe  think  about  sports, let us not  just  think  about  the\r\n\r\nstructured  facilities  and  the  stadiums.   They  are  very\r\n\r\nimportant.   But  sports  is enjoyed and  played  by  people,\r\n\r\namongst friends and neighbours, in a very casual way,  before\r\n\r\nthey  get into something more serious.  And this is  where  I\r\n\r\nthink facilities must be accessible, and close as possible to\r\n\r\nour  people.  Therefore, I think the HDB is  important.   The\r\n\r\nparks  and  recreation  areas are important.   While  we  are\r\n\r\ntrying to promote sports,  I feel, as a soccer player, as  if\r\n\r\nthere  is a war against soccer players.  When you look  at  a\r\n\r\npiece of very nice ground which looks very inviting, you just\r\n\r\nwant  to put on your boots and kick a ball around.  There  is\r\n\r\nalways  a  suspicious looking mound or some trees  somewhere.\r\n\r\nWhat  could be a goal post, they put two trees and some other\r\n\r\nobstacles.  And sometimes more blatant, they put a  signboard\r\n\r\nwhich says \"No Ball Games\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we have to be very consistent about this,\r\n\r\nbecause we really want to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nencourage  sports  at  the casual level,  at  the  grassroots\r\n\r\nlevel.  People just want to run around.  If we go to the  NIE\r\n\r\nand  Chinese  High  School  -  these are two  very  excellent\r\n\r\nexamples   -  on a weekend, there is a whole sports community\r\n\r\nthat is being developed here, simply because the institutions\r\n\r\nallow  people from the neighbourhood to come and play  at  no\r\n\r\ncharge.   At  other  places, it is  more  difficult.   And  I\r\n\r\nsympathise with the principals of schools where on  weekends,\r\n\r\nboys will climb over the school fence or break into the fence\r\n\r\njust to get into a piece of ground where they can play soccer\r\n\r\ntogether.  While we think about all the big things, there are\r\n\r\nmany  small  things that we can do in our neighbourhood  that\r\n\r\ncan  make  individuals,  young boys and  children,  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nsports in a more casual manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, as\r\n\r\nwe progress in the 21st century, Singapore has begun to place\r\n\r\nmore importance on the other aspects of life.  We begin to be\r\n\r\nmore  concerned with the lighter parts of our life,  such  as\r\n\r\nthe   arts,  sports,  etc.   All  the  time,  we  have   high\r\n\r\nexpectations  of ourselves, and whatever we do,  we  must  do\r\n\r\nwell.    In  sports,  I  think  we  should  also  have   some\r\n\r\nachievements,  because sports is a very important  aspect  of\r\n\r\nour nation building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans are now better educated and they are\r\n\r\nmore mature.   Now they would want to have better quality  of\r\n\r\nlife  in order to balance off the stressful city state  life,\r\n\r\nbecause  sports  is  a good way to help Singaporeans  digress\r\n\r\nfrom their stressful life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of sports is gradually falling into place,\r\n\r\nparticularly with the formation of the Ministry of  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Sports.   Now,  all  the  national   sports\r\n\r\nassociations come under the purview of the MCDS.  Already, we\r\n\r\nhave seen many great sporting events being held in Singapore,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the Singapore Golf Masters, and we have the  Soccer\r\n\r\n<br><br>2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision,  etc.   Of course, we need to  improve  on  the\r\n\r\nfacilities for all these sporting activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a conference was organised by the Committee on\r\n\r\nSporting  Singapore to review and present the  findings  from\r\n\r\nits  various sporting committees.  We need to build a culture\r\n\r\namong Singaporeans to appreciate and accept sports as another\r\n\r\nworthwhile   endeavour  and  achievement.    In   all   these\r\n\r\npresentations,   there   were  many   creative   and   useful\r\n\r\nrecommendations that could raise the awareness  and  standard\r\n\r\nof sports in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this year's budget, the Singapore Sports Council\r\n\r\nis  only allocated $45.59 million.  This is only 4.1% or just\r\n\r\n$1.8 million more than last year.  If we compare it with  the\r\n\r\ntasks that the Singapore Sports Council needs to undertake to\r\n\r\nmeet  the increased demands, I think this is very negligible.\r\n\r\nThis increase in budget is mainly provided for the subvention\r\n\r\nof  land  cost,  provision for the operating of  Jurong  East\r\n\r\nswimming complex, salary revision and CPF adjustments of  the\r\n\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the national sports associations, they were\r\n\r\ntotally  neglected in this year's budget provision.   Are  we\r\n\r\nsaying  that the national sports associations have to survive\r\n\r\non  their  own?  Under such circumstances, how can we  expect\r\n\r\nthese   national  sports  associations  to  carry  out  their\r\n\r\nmission,  not  to mention the promotion of sports  activities\r\n\r\nand the advancement of sports?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, many of the national sports associations are\r\n\r\nstruggling  in their fund raising efforts.  Willing  sponsors\r\n\r\nare  increasingly  difficult to come by, as  national  sports\r\n\r\nassociations need to compete with so many other activities to\r\n\r\nfight for a slice of the sponsorship pie.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that not all the sports associations can be\r\n\r\nas  lucky as the Football Association of Singapore, which has\r\n\r\na  very  huge  sponsorship.  Many associations  need  to  get\r\n\r\ngrants  from  the Singapore Sports Council to  promote  their\r\n\r\ncause.   So  I  strongly call upon the Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\nincreasing  the budget in line with the increased  tasks  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities that are expected from the Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, I would urge the Government to increase the\r\n\r\nsubsidy to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnational sports associations.  I hope that the Minister  will\r\n\r\nconsider  giving   an off-budget subsidy  to  these  national\r\n\r\nsports   associations.   Then,  with  all  the  support   and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure in place, this will be the right time  for  us\r\n\r\nto  correct the negative perception and enhance the image and\r\n\r\nstatus of sports in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on the community sports\r\n\r\nclinic.   The  sports  for life programme,  launched  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Sports Council, has been successful  in  promoting\r\n\r\nhealthy  lifestyle among Singaporeans, especially the elderly\r\n\r\nand   housewives.    Many  Singaporeans  are   beginning   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the sports for life programme, such  as  brisk\r\n\r\nwalking  and  many  other games.  As we have  a  fast  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation, we should continue our efforts to keep our people\r\n\r\nhealthy.   But  the  push  for a  healthy  lifestyle  by  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  must  also  be supported by the  necessary  sports\r\n\r\nclinics and medicine infrastructure.  Presently, we have only\r\n\r\none  sports  clinic at the Sports Council serving mainly  our\r\n\r\nnational  and school athletes.   The centre has basic  sports\r\n\r\nmedical facilities but lacks the modern equipment for  sports\r\n\r\ninjury  diagnosis  and  therapy such  as  magnetic  resonance\r\n\r\nimaging (MRI) equipment.   The limited resources also do  not\r\n\r\npermit  the  centre to conduct sports medicine research,  and\r\n\r\neducation to the general public.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we become more active in mobilising the masses into\r\n\r\nsporting  activities, we need to provide adequate, accessible\r\n\r\nand  convenient sports clinics at the community level.  These\r\n\r\nclinics   can   provide  consultations  for  sports   injury,\r\n\r\nphysiotherapy  and  rehabilitation  services  at   affordable\r\n\r\ncosts.   It  is  a  form  of primary  healthcare  for  sports\r\n\r\ninjuries at the community level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to seek the following clarifications\r\n\r\nfrom the Ministry:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) What are the plans the Ministry has in providing\r\n\r\nsports medicine infrastructure in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) What are the resources committed to train sports\r\n\r\ndoctors and physiotherapists?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What is the appropriate ratio between the\r\n\r\npopulation  and sports doctor as compared to other  developed\r\n\r\ncountries?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Will the Ministry build more sports clinics at the\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;community level?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wang Kai Yuen is not here. Mr Chiam\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Tong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, if Singapore wants to promote\r\n\r\nsports, then I think the Government and the people in general\r\n\r\nmust  show respect for our sportsmen and sportswomen who have\r\n\r\nbrought  honour  to  Singapore by  winning  in  international\r\n\r\ncompetitions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to highlight the case of two brothers who\r\n\r\nrepresented  Singapore  in  water  polo.   The  two  brothers\r\n\r\naltogether  won  11  medals for Singapore,  comprising  seven\r\n\r\ngolds,  three  silvers and one bronze at the  Asian  and  SEA\r\n\r\nGames.   They  are  both  Singaporeans.   They  are  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and are blue-blooded Singaporeans and not  imported\r\n\r\nones.   They  are Mr Gan Eng Guan and his brother.   Although\r\n\r\nthey  have contributed so much to Singapore, they are shunned\r\n\r\nand  ignored by our sports officials.  In 1998, there  was  a\r\n\r\nmuch  publicised social function called \"Reunion (Water Polo)\r\n\r\n1998\",   organised   by   the  Singapore   Amateur   Swimming\r\n\r\nAssociation,  where other prominent past  and  present  water\r\n\r\npolo players were invited, including some from overseas.  But\r\n\r\nthe two prominent brothers who are genuine Singapore products\r\n\r\nwere  not  invited.  They were really outstanding water  polo\r\n\r\nplayers  in the 50s and 60s, and there was no excuse for  the\r\n\r\nofficials  of the Singapore Amateur Swimming Association  not\r\n\r\nto know them in 1998.  Yet, they were not the ones invited as\r\n\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the attitude of our sports officials towards\r\n\r\nour  better known sportsmen, we can then understand  why  the\r\n\r\nsports scene in Singapore is in such a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsorry state.  I can also understand why a female official  in\r\n\r\nthe Netball Association said that 95% of the Singapore sports\r\n\r\nofficials  should be sacked.  Our sportsmen spend  many  long\r\n\r\nhours to achieve international standards and bring honour  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Yet, when they retired, they were thrown into the\r\n\r\ndust heap and forgotten.  Can we then wonder why the standard\r\n\r\nof sports in Singapore is so low?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can look into this problem of the\r\n\r\ntwo  brothers.   They have brought honour to  Singapore,  yet\r\n\r\nignored  by  the  Singapore Amateur Swimming Association.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister can investigate and get to the bottom  of\r\n\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Sir, I would like to thank Members for\r\n\r\ntheir views and questions on sports.  This is something close\r\n\r\nto  my  heart  and close to the hearts of many  officials  in\r\n\r\nMCDS.   Let me address the issues and questions Members  have\r\n\r\nbrought up.  What I would do is to sketch the broad plans  of\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Ministry has on sports, and along the way  address\r\n\r\nMembers' concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry was renamed the Ministry of Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Sports in April last year,  to  signal  the\r\n\r\ngreater  priority the Government intends to give  to  sports.\r\n\r\nAnd we are ready to do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong, Dr Vasoo and Prof. Toh See Kiat are\r\n\r\nkeen  to  know what our plans are.  Sir, over the past  year,\r\n\r\nthe  Committee on Sporting Singapore (CoSS), which  I  chair,\r\n\r\nhas  been discussing the various ways in which sports can  be\r\n\r\nfurther  developed in Singapore.  Our vision  is  that  of  a\r\n\r\nSporting  Singapore based on three pillars: sports  for  all,\r\n\r\nsports excellence and the building of a sports industry.   We\r\n\r\nshared  some of the key recommendations of CoSS at  a  public\r\n\r\nseminar about three weeks ago.   I would like to repeat them.\r\n\r\nThese are to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Promote a sporting culture in Singapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Strengthen the National Sports Associations;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Establish a Sports School;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Enhance sports science and sports medicine;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Develop the sports industry; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Build a sports hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am indeed very pleased to announce that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  accepted  in  principle the interim  recommendations  of\r\n\r\nCoSS.  Let me talk about these in detail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sports participation rate was about 34%, according\r\n\r\nto  a  survey in 1997, an increase of 10% from 24%  in  1992.\r\n\r\nBeyond  improving  the participation rates,  we  aim  to  get\r\n\r\npeople  excited about sports by nurturing a sporting culture.\r\n\r\nBecause when we talk about sports, we are talking of passion,\r\n\r\ncommitment and discipline.  When people play sports together,\r\n\r\nthey  develop  bonds  which help build  a  cohesive  society.\r\n\r\nDuring  those Malaysian Cup days when the Singapore team  was\r\n\r\nplaying,  you  would  notice  how  the  audience  rooted  for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  how everyone became one.  When our  table  tennis\r\n\r\nplayer  Jing Junhong played at the semi-finals in the  recent\r\n\r\nOlympics, everyone in Singapore - even those who did not know\r\n\r\nthe difference between a golf ball and a tennis ball - rooted\r\n\r\nfor Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Chiam for his support for\r\n\r\nsports  and  assure him that the Government has  always  been\r\n\r\nsupportive  of  sports.   We  want  to  continue  our  sports\r\n\r\npromotion  efforts and do more to raise the status of  sports\r\n\r\nhere.   The  Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and the Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Olympic  Council  (SNOC)  are  already  giving  out\r\n\r\nseveral  awards.  This is in answer to some of  the  Members'\r\n\r\nquestions on whether we are giving out sports awards  to  our\r\n\r\nathletes.    We   do.   SSC,  for  example,   awards   sports\r\n\r\nscholarships.  Nevertheless, we will see how we  can  further\r\n\r\nimprove on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports clubs and associations also have important roles\r\n\r\nto play in building a sports\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nculture in Singapore and providing sports programmes  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.   Mr  Goh Chong Chia mentioned having to develop  our\r\n\r\nyoung  in  sports.  We agree.    In particular,  we  need  to\r\n\r\nactively promote sports among our youth.  We will see how  we\r\n\r\ncan  help  the clubs improve the quality of their  programmes\r\n\r\nand  services  so that more Singaporeans can play  and  enjoy\r\n\r\nsports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked if we should allow sports clubs and\r\n\r\nassociations to manage sports complexes.  There are strategic\r\n\r\nreasons  for  retaining the management  of  these  facilities\r\n\r\nunder  the SSC.  It would be in a better position to  promote\r\n\r\nsports  to  the  general  public and help  build  a  sporting\r\n\r\nculture  in  Singapore.  For example,  the  Sports  Council's\r\n\r\nRegional Sports and Fitness Centres are housed within  sports\r\n\r\ncomplexes, and they have comprehensive programmes to increase\r\n\r\nthe  sports participation rate of Singaporeans.  Perhaps over\r\n\r\ntime,  when the sports clubs and associations have  developed\r\n\r\nfurther, we can consider privatising the management of sports\r\n\r\ncomplexes in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note the concerns of Prof. Toh See Kiat and Mr\r\n\r\nZulkifli  Baharudin  regarding  the  availability  of  sports\r\n\r\nfacilities  in Singapore.  I take Mr Zulkifli's  point  about\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of  informal sports  activities,  like  just\r\n\r\nkicking  a ball around or just playing catching, as it  were,\r\n\r\nwith  your  kids.   Having  adequate  sports  facilities  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans is a prerequisite for building a sports  culture\r\n\r\nhere.   In  FY  2000, the Singapore Sports Council  committed\r\n\r\nabout $37 million on sports facilities for the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In land-scarce Singapore, there are limits on how much\r\n\r\nland  we  can  set aside for sports.  However,  we  can  find\r\n\r\ninnovative ways to maximise the use of land in Singapore  for\r\n\r\nsports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, my Ministry and Singapore Sports Council are\r\n\r\nconsidering three strategies: Firstly, we can explore the use\r\n\r\nof temporarily vacant state land for sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, existing facilities such as school fields and\r\n\r\nopen spaces, as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmentioned by Mr Zulkifli, are indeed important resources that\r\n\r\ncould be tapped.  As a pilot project, SSC is negotiating with\r\n\r\na  few  schools  to  manage and maintain the  school  fields.\r\n\r\nUnder  SSC's  management, these fields can be made  available\r\n\r\nfor  public use outside school hours.  This, hopefully, would\r\n\r\navoid  the  problem  which Mr Zulkifli  has  mentioned  about\r\n\r\nschools' property and premises being damaged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we can make use of technology to maximise the\r\n\r\nuse  of facilities.  For example, as an alternative to  grass\r\n\r\nfields,  artificial surfaces which are not  affected  by  wet\r\n\r\nweather  and  can  withstand heavier  continuous  usage  with\r\n\r\nminimal damage, will be introduced.  The utilisation rate can\r\n\r\nbe  increased  three-fold.   SSC has  in  fact  installed  an\r\n\r\nartificial  field  at St Wilfrid Sports Complex  as  a  pilot\r\n\r\nproject.  If this is successful, we will try to see  how  the\r\n\r\nuse of such artificial surfaces can be extended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree with Mr Ang Mong Seng that much can be\r\n\r\ndone  to raise the standard of sports in Singapore.  I  think\r\n\r\nwe  all  agree  to  that.  The National  Sports  Associations\r\n\r\n(NSAs)  must take the lead in developing and promoting  their\r\n\r\nrespective sports.  They are in the best position to  do  so.\r\n\r\nThey  know the athletes, they know the sports, and they  have\r\n\r\nthe  expertise.   Our  proposals to  develop  sports  can  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful only if the NSAs have the expertise and  resources\r\n\r\nto support the implementation of the recommendations of CoSS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to Prof. Toh's remark, we already have quite a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  schemes  in  place to  develop  athletes,  either\r\n\r\nthrough  the NSAs, or directly.  For example, since 1993,  $8\r\n\r\nmillion  has  been set aside for sports excellence  annually.\r\n\r\nBesides  the  $3.5  million for schemes to  support  athletes\r\n\r\ndirectly,  NSAs  are also given assistance to  develop  their\r\n\r\nadministration,  coaching  expertise  and  youth  development\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  and we will definitely see how we could  further\r\n\r\nimprove to help develop athletes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further strengthen the NSAs, we intend to work with\r\n\r\nthe NSAs to establish\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlong  term plans for developing their sports.  More resources\r\n\r\nwill  be  given - we have thought about this - to  help  them\r\n\r\nachieve their goals, so long as their performance targets are\r\n\r\nmet.  In other words, we are willing and will be working into\r\n\r\nproviding them more financial support, provided they are more\r\n\r\naccountable.   They  would  be held accountable  towards  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment and promotion of their sports.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year I mentioned the possibility of setting up\r\n\r\na  Sports  School  in Singapore.  This institution  has  been\r\n\r\nmentioned by several Members.  Some call it sports institute,\r\n\r\nsome  call  it sports school.  And I am pleased  to  announce\r\n\r\nthat the Government has approved this initiative.  The sports\r\n\r\nschool  will  give  students  with  talent  for  sports   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to hone their skills while ensuring their studies\r\n\r\nare  well  taken  care of.   The time is  right  for  such  a\r\n\r\nconcept, albeit a new one, in Singapore to be tried out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is vital that we get the concept right and put in\r\n\r\nplace  a  strong team to establish and run the sports school.\r\n\r\nThe  principal would be key to ensuring the success.  He must\r\n\r\nhave good standing in both sports and education and have  the\r\n\r\nability to build up an organisation from scratch.  We are  in\r\n\r\nthe process of searching for such a principal for the school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important the sports school provides the best\r\n\r\nsports  training available for students, while maintaining  a\r\n\r\nrobust  and  rigorous academic curriculum.  Parents,  as  you\r\n\r\nknow, must feel confident that their children's sporting  and\r\n\r\neducational  needs  are  well taken care  of  in  the  sports\r\n\r\nschool,  and  this  addresses some of the Members'  concerns.\r\n\r\nAnd  a clear pathway must also be available for graduates  of\r\n\r\nthe  sports school.  In this regard, the sports school  needs\r\n\r\nto  forge strategic alliances with tertiary institutions  and\r\n\r\nsports organisations.  Definitely, a lot of ground work needs\r\n\r\nto be done to set up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe school, and we schedule one to be ready in 2003 or 2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked about our efforts in building up\r\n\r\nsports  medicine and sports science expertise.  Sir,  we  are\r\n\r\nnow  in  an  era  where raw talent is no  longer  enough  for\r\n\r\nsporting  excellence.   At that level  of  competition  where\r\n\r\nphysical prowess and talent are almost equal, technology  can\r\n\r\ngive  you that edge, a milli-second, that extra inch, to  win\r\n\r\nyour  event.  The last Olympics, for example, we saw swimmers\r\n\r\nwearing  ribbed swim suits where it helps them glide  through\r\n\r\nthe  water.  You see how runners wear spectacles, instead  of\r\n\r\nhaving them over the ears, go over their heads, and they have\r\n\r\nto  have  a  bald  head  to wear such spectacles.   So  elite\r\n\r\nathletes will increasingly require sports science and  sports\r\n\r\nmedicine   support  to  give  them  the  extra  edge   during\r\n\r\ncompetitions at international level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fourth CoSS interim recommendation is to\r\n\r\ndevelop  Singapore as a centre for sports science and  sports\r\n\r\nmedicine.  The Sports Council will continue to take the  lead\r\n\r\nin providing sports medicine services, especially to national\r\n\r\nathletes  and to the National Sports Associations.  The  NSAs\r\n\r\nwill also be encouraged to develop sports medicine and sports\r\n\r\nscience   committees  with  the  Singapore  Sports  Council's\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the general public, SSC intends to improve sports\r\n\r\ninjury  management  among doctors and  physiotherapists.   It\r\n\r\nwill  do  this  through organising seminars and sourcing  for\r\n\r\nappropriate sports medicine courses here and abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But rather than the Government setting up sports clinics\r\n\r\nat  the community level, we feel that it would be more viable\r\n\r\nto leave this to market forces.  Because already there are  a\r\n\r\nfew  private sector clinics, which practise sports  medicine.\r\n\r\nAnd   I  believe  this  market  will  continue  to  grow   as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans become more aware of the importance of leading a\r\n\r\nhealthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these traditional areas of sports for all and\r\n\r\nsports  excellence,  we also see a need  to  build  a  sports\r\n\r\nindustry  to  provide  viable careers  for  athletes  and  to\r\n\r\nsustain  the sports delivery system in Singapore.  This  will\r\n\r\naddress  Mr  Ang  Mong Seng's and Mr Goh Chong  Chia's  point\r\n\r\nabout providing a career development path for athletes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to sports awards and full-time training\r\n\r\nscholarships  overseas, there is already such a scheme  under\r\n\r\nSPEX 21.  Several athletes, including thrower James Wong  and\r\n\r\nswimmers  Joscelin  Yeo and Sng Ju Wei, have  benefited  from\r\n\r\nthis  scheme.  We have also signed Memoranda of Understanding\r\n\r\nwith Korea and with China which facilitate full-time training\r\n\r\nstints overseas for all the athletes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSC also talks to athletes and counsels them when\r\n\r\nthey  embark  on  full-time training, to help them  formulate\r\n\r\ntheir  long-term plans for sports, for their career  and  for\r\n\r\ntheir  individual development.  So indeed, there  is  already\r\n\r\nsome counselling and guidance by the Sports Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSC has also provided employment to many national\r\n\r\nathletes  for a number of years, so long as they  fulfil  the\r\n\r\nentry  requirements for such job vacancies.  But in the  long\r\n\r\nterm,  the  solution must be to grow the sports  industry  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to provide wider career opportunities in sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore plan to institute a sports industry\r\n\r\ndevelopment programme to cultivate a vibrant sports sector in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We  will  set  up a marketing  team  to  promote\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a  venue  of choice for  world-class  sporting\r\n\r\nevents,    sports   service   providers   and   international\r\n\r\nfederations.   Such  events will help  create  that  buzz  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and make Singapore an even more attractive  place\r\n\r\nto live.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Chong Chia mentioned about building a new\r\n\r\nstadium; several others too.  This is precisely what we  have\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmind.  To complement the development of a sports industry, we\r\n\r\nintend  to  redevelop the National Stadium into an integrated\r\n\r\nsports hub.  Our Kallang Stadium has served us very well.  It\r\n\r\nis  decades  old now and is becoming outdated.  A sports  hub\r\n\r\nwill  provide Singaporeans with a world-class venue to  watch\r\n\r\ntop level sports, as well as provide excellent facilities for\r\n\r\nsports participation.  My Ministry will conduct a feasibility\r\n\r\nstudy  on  what form this sports hub would take  and  confirm\r\n\r\nwhere it should be located.   And I take the suggestion by Mr\r\n\r\nGoh Chong Chia about organising a national design competition\r\n\r\nfor the stadium, which we can consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the initiatives I have outlined will require\r\n\r\nadditional resources.  To build up the momentum, Members, and\r\n\r\nespecially  Mr  Ong Ah Heng and Mr Chiam See  Tong,  will  be\r\n\r\npleased  to know that the Government, together with Singapore\r\n\r\nPools,  will be committing $500 million to sports  over  five\r\n\r\nyears to implement these initiatives.  And this excludes  the\r\n\r\nredevelopment  of  the National Stadium, which  will  take  a\r\n\r\nlittle  longer to study in detail.   In reply to  Mr  Ong  Ah\r\n\r\nHeng's comment about the $45.59 million, this is actually the\r\n\r\nbudget  allocated to the Sports Council and is only  for  the\r\n\r\nannual  operating  grant  for  operation  of  programmes  and\r\n\r\nmaintenance of sports facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on Mr Chiam's point about recognising our past\r\n\r\nsports heroes, I take his point.  This is something we should\r\n\r\nbe  looking  into  and,  certainly,  we  will  accord  proper\r\n\r\nrecognition to our sporting heroes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the many MPs who have spoken in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  sports. Singapore sports seem set  for  exciting\r\n\r\ntimes  ahead.  The initiatives recommended by CoSS  will  set\r\n\r\nthe  scene for a paradigm shift in the way we view sports  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The CoSS will finalise its report by  June  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, a lot has already been said\r\n\r\nabout the widening income gap by many Members during the past\r\n\r\nfew years.  I shall try my best not to repeat the arguments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.40 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we may not be able to do much as a small economy\r\n\r\nto  influence  this global trend, we can and we should  start\r\n\r\nworking on measures that would ameliorate the consequences of\r\n\r\nthis  widening income gap.  However, attempting to do  so  by\r\n\r\nslowing down the most able from accelerating ahead, squeezing\r\n\r\nthe  rich  or  artifically boosting wages of  non-competitive\r\n\r\njobs  would  be  disastrous.  There are countries  that  have\r\n\r\ntried  some,  or  all of these measures, and  invariably  the\r\n\r\nresults  were not quite they expected.  Yes, it is true  that\r\n\r\nwe  are a meritocracy, that every Singaporean, regardless  of\r\n\r\nhow humble his or her family background, can succeed.  And we\r\n\r\nread  with admiration from time to time of cases of  students\r\n\r\nfrom humble families doing brilliantly in their studies.  But\r\n\r\nare  all our children, including those with disabilities  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  fall  or choose to remain outside the  mainstream\r\n\r\neducation  system, given an equal opportunity to  succeed  in\r\n\r\nlife  when  they  grow  up?  Or are these  people  likely  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the widening income gap when  they  join  the\r\n\r\nworkforce?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, working with the community, should\r\n\r\ncarefully  monitor and fine-tune our systems to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nevery  child is given the best chance to achieve his  or  her\r\n\r\nfull potential and equipped with the relevant skills to get a\r\n\r\ndecent  job  when they join the workforce.  It is  also  true\r\n\r\nthat  low  skilled  workers can get ahead  if  they  were  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  skills and to attend retraining.   But  those\r\n\r\nthat  could  should upgrade their skills to stay relevant  in\r\n\r\nthe  new economy.  However, we must be aware that there  will\r\n\r\nbe  a small number who would, if only they could.  Our policy\r\n\r\nmakers  must  realise that there will always  be  those  who,\r\n\r\ndespite their best efforts, will not be able to keep up  with\r\n\r\nthe  best,  or the rest.  Some may not have the literacy  and\r\n\r\nnumeracy  skills,  or  the intellectual ability,  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are to bond as a cohesive society, the low\r\n\r\nincome,  the less able and the disabled should never be  made\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfeel  disenfranchised and neglected.  As the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nso  aptly  put across in his Budget Statement when he  stated\r\n\r\nthat,  at  the end of the day, we have to ensure  that  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  has  a  place  in  the  Singapore  of  the   new\r\n\r\nmillennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the number of public assistance cases, although\r\n\r\ncomparatively  small, is beginning to show a  gradual  upward\r\n\r\ntrend over the last two years.  Even though the criteria that\r\n\r\nqualify  for  public assistance have not been made  any  less\r\n\r\nstringent, are more Singaporeans falling into poverty  amidst\r\n\r\nour  apparent  prosperity?  Could the  Minister  explain  the\r\n\r\ncause of this disturbing trend?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also find ways to create adequate social safety\r\n\r\nnets for these people, but in a manner that would not destroy\r\n\r\nthe  sense of self-worth, or the incentive for them  to  give\r\n\r\nout  their  best  however  humble that  may  be.   Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister tell the House what measures and strategies MCDS has\r\n\r\nadopted to assist low income families to cope with the  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges  taking  place  in the economy  and  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, children from low income households who do not have\r\n\r\na  strong  family support home environment benefit  the  most\r\n\r\nfrom  attending  good  childcare and  before-and-after-school\r\n\r\ncare  centres.  Unfortunately, many low income  families  may\r\n\r\nnot be able to afford to send their children to childcare  or\r\n\r\nbefore-and-after-school  care centres.   Would  the  Minister\r\n\r\ntherefore  consider  introducing  schemes  to  make  it  more\r\n\r\naffordable for these families to send their children to  good\r\n\r\nchildcare and before-and-after-school centres?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also institute measures that will make it\r\n\r\neasier  for the more successful to assist the less  fortunate\r\n\r\nin  order to enhance social cohesion.  For example,  the  CPF\r\n\r\ntop-ups are automatically credited into the accounts  of  the\r\n\r\neligible  Singaporeans, regardless of whether  they  need  or\r\n\r\nwant  the  money.  I therefore support the suggestion  by  Dr\r\n\r\nJennifer  Lee that eligible recipients of CPF top-ups  should\r\n\r\nbe  required  to submit applications for their  entitlements.\r\n\r\nThose who are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbetter off and who want to help the less fortunate should  be\r\n\r\npermitted to have their entitlements channelled to  the  CDCs\r\n\r\nin  order  to  help  the  poor in the community.   Would  the\r\n\r\nMinister  support such a measure to make it easier  for  more\r\n\r\nable Singaporeans to assist the less able?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I share the viewpoints expressed by Mr\r\n\r\nCharles  Chong.  With the restructuring of the economy,  low-income  families with semi-skilled and unskilled  backgrounds\r\n\r\nare  more  likely  to  be affected and they  will  also  face\r\n\r\neconomic setbacks.  The unemployment rate has increased, more\r\n\r\nolder-person households have been affected and they  are  the\r\n\r\nones who are likely to face various difficulties.  It can  be\r\n\r\nseen  that  low-income families with dependent children  are,\r\n\r\nparticularly,  the  ones  having  low  skills  and  unskilled\r\n\r\nbackgrounds, and are most vulnerable to problems.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of this situation, it is important that the\r\n\r\nMinistry   takes  a  more  pro-active  step   by   taking   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  review of various issues that  are  likely  to\r\n\r\naffect  the  low-income families.  By doing so, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nwould  be able to come up with a more comprehensive  plan  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with the problems of these vulnerable families, in  the\r\n\r\nlight of various economic restructuring and changes that  are\r\n\r\nlikely to take place.  I would like to ask the Minister  what\r\n\r\nnew  plans and programmes the Ministry will put in  place  to\r\n\r\nparticularly help low-income families.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, even as we find many positive\r\n\r\nthings  to note in our economic progress and achievements  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we are also very aware that the bottom 10%-20%  of\r\n\r\nour  households has seen the average income stagnate even  as\r\n\r\nthe  cost of living continues to rise.  I would like to touch\r\n\r\non two issues in extending a helping hand to such families in\r\n\r\nneed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, while we know that we have good social safety\r\n\r\nnets  and  many assistance schemes in place, it is often  the\r\n\r\ncase that those people who are most in need of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhelp  are  the  ones who least know how to access  it.   Last\r\n\r\nSaturday,  Dr Tan Cheng Bock spoke of the need for people  to\r\n\r\nbe   aware   of   how   to  access  the   healthcare   system\r\n\r\nappropriately, so that they can have maximum benefit  of  the\r\n\r\navailable subsidised services.  I would, therefore,  like  to\r\n\r\npropose  to MCDS that it conduct an educational programme  to\r\n\r\nprovide   comprehensive  but  easy-to-understand  information\r\n\r\ntargeted  at  the  lower-income households,  to  inform  this\r\n\r\ntarget  group of the various subsidised services provided  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and  how to access these  services,  through\r\n\r\nchannels  that  will  allow them  the  best  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\navailable subsidies, and of the variety of assistance schemes\r\n\r\navailable and how to go about applying for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reaching out to needy families on a case-by-case\r\n\r\nbasis, especially the lesser educated and the isolated, it is\r\n\r\nobviously  very difficult to be sure that no  one  who  needs\r\n\r\nhelp  is  missed.  In this context, the passing over  of  the\r\n\r\ndisbursement  of  subsidies, fees and other  assistance,  and\r\n\r\ncommunity-based facilities from MCDS to the CDCs, is  a  good\r\n\r\nmove,  as  the  latter should be able to be more  focused  on\r\n\r\nresidents in their jurisdiction who need a hand, and be  able\r\n\r\nto  reach  out  more extensively to them.  This  is  a  heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibility for the CDCs, and it is imperative  that  they\r\n\r\ngear up to discharge it well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is flexibility in implementing\r\n\r\nassistance  schemes.   We  understand  that  regulations  and\r\n\r\nguidelines for various assistance schemes may have been drawn\r\n\r\nin  ways to attempt to control or minimise the possibility of\r\n\r\nabuse.   However, there are often people in need who may  not\r\n\r\nfit  into pre-determined criteria, or may be genuinely  hard-luck  cases.   It  is therefore important  that  officers  in\r\n\r\ncharge   of   implementing  assistance   schemes   have   the\r\n\r\nflexibility  to exercise judgement in cases of genuine  need.\r\n\r\nOnly  in  this way can we truly say that any one who needs  a\r\n\r\nhelping hand in Singapore can be assured of getting it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, recent data from\r\n\r\nCensus 2000 indicated\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  8.7%  of  the total resident households are  households\r\n\r\nwith  no  income earners, up from 7.5%.  But translated  into\r\n\r\nabsolute numbers, that is a total of 80,000 households, which\r\n\r\nis  not  a  small number.  The statistics also show that  the\r\n\r\naverage  monthly  household income  for  the  lowest  10%  of\r\n\r\nfamilies  was a startling $61 per month.  Sir, these  figures\r\n\r\ndo  not represent the true picture, as the Chief Statistician\r\n\r\nhimself  admitted that the figures were misleading.  Firstly,\r\n\r\nit  is  actually  impossible for the lowest 10%  to  have  an\r\n\r\nincome  of only $61, unless they are not aware of the  public\r\n\r\nassistance scheme or, for various reasons, do not qualify for\r\n\r\npublic  assistance.  Anyone with such low income  would  have\r\n\r\nqualified  for public assistance, which gives  a  minimum  of\r\n\r\n$230  per  month.  Secondly, also as indicated by  the  Chief\r\n\r\nStatistician, the figures, for those without income,  include\r\n\r\nretirees  with savings, stocks, working children who  support\r\n\r\nthem, and some who own landed properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could MCDS help to normalise these data, using the\r\n\r\nretiree  factor, so that we can have a more accurate picture?\r\n\r\nWhat  I would like to know is the actual number of the really\r\n\r\npoor  no-income families.  For those families,  how  do  they\r\n\r\nsurvive?   Is public assistance able to help them?  How  does\r\n\r\nMCDS  tackle the income inequality of these households?   How\r\n\r\ndo  we  make sure that children from these no-income families\r\n\r\ncan get a decent education?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I note that the amount\r\n\r\nof  money  we give to needy families is a subject  of  review\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to time.  However, with the changing demands  and\r\n\r\nrequirements of the people, the categories, by which  we  use\r\n\r\nto  assess  what is adequate for families, may well  have  to\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether in the light of\r\n\r\nthe  changing  needs of Singaporeans today, and  taking  into\r\n\r\naccount  the higher cost of living, the assistance  given  to\r\n\r\nneedy families properly reflects these changes.  Secondly,  I\r\n\r\nwould also like to know whether our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeans test should be reviewed, in the light of the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe cost of living is now higher in Singapore and the general\r\n\r\nwage  level  has  gone up.  Thirdly, is the Ministry  working\r\n\r\nclosely with the Ministry of Manpower to work on the prospect\r\n\r\nof employability for those who are on public assistance?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, the increase in the number of dual-career families would pose problems for the care of the\r\n\r\nelderly  who are frail, because this will become a tremendous\r\n\r\nburden  in terms of care by such families.  About 82% of  our\r\n\r\nhouseholds are one-family nuclear families.  It is  therefore\r\n\r\nexpected   that  many  of  these  families  will  be   facing\r\n\r\ntremendous stress in having to care for the elderly  who  are\r\n\r\nfrail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to review what comprehensive\r\n\r\nsupport network will be available to these families.   It  is\r\n\r\nvery  important that we develop as quickly as  possible  some\r\n\r\nsupport system within the neighbourhood or the locality where\r\n\r\nthere are more elderly persons living, to provide support for\r\n\r\nsuch  families.   I  would  like to  ask  the  Minister  what\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  plans are there to provide programmes  at  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  level  to support families  which  have  frail\r\n\r\nelderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, with a rapidly aging population,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  need  for  a comprehensive  infrastructure  for\r\n\r\neldercare.   Currently, most of the eldercare facilities  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes are operated by VWOs.  My questions are:  Are  the\r\n\r\ncurrent eldercare facilities sufficient?  What measures  will\r\n\r\nbe taken to improve the quantity and quality of elderly care?\r\n\r\nWhat  role  can  the private sector play in  caring  for  the\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens?

But many of  these\r\n\r\nvolunteers  and  befrienders are themselves  aging.   Efforts\r\n\r\nwill  need  to  be  made  to develop a sufficient  number  of\r\n\r\nsuitable  care-givers for the aged.

One\r\n\r\nproblem,  Sir, is the mindset of employers.  While retraining\r\n\r\nwill  help  to  a certain extent, however, not all  jobs  are\r\n\r\nsuitable  for the elderly.  Many jobs would need  to  be  re-engineered to make them suitable for the elderly to  perform.\r\n\r\nWhat   measures   will  be  taken  to  encourage   and   help\r\n\r\norganisations re-engineer some of their jobs,  to  make  them\r\n\r\nsuitable for the older people in our community?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I thank Members for speaking\r\n\r\nup  for  our low-income families, as this is another  subject\r\n\r\nwhich  is  actually very close to my Ministry's heart.   Many\r\n\r\nMembers,  including Mr Charles Chong, Dr Vasoo,  Dr  Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee,  Dr  Ho  Tat  Kin  and Mr Sin Boon Ann,  have  expressed\r\n\r\nconcern about the growing income divide and the needs of  the\r\n\r\nlow-income families in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, at MCDS, empathise with this concern. Our approach\r\n\r\nhas   always   been   to   facilitate   self-reliance   among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, including the lower-income, by helping them  to\r\n\r\ndevelop skills and the capability to help themselves because,\r\n\r\nusually,  this  is  the  best  way  to  help  the  low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies.   As  the saying goes, if we give someone  fish  to\r\n\r\neat,  it would only make him full for a day, but if we  teach\r\n\r\nhim  to fish, he would have food for a lifetime.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime we promote the \"Many Helping Hands\" approach, where  the\r\n\r\nmore  successful help those who are less fortunate,  a  point\r\n\r\nmentioned by some Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the transition to the new economy has brought the\r\n\r\nissue of helping low-income families into sharper focus.   We\r\n\r\nhear that there are more and more families not being able  to\r\n\r\ncope,  and  that there is a bigger gap between the haves  and\r\n\r\nthe  have-nots.  But I agree with Dr Ho Tat Kin when he  says\r\n\r\nthat the data, which we have, do not really show the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nactual  extent  of  the  problem  among  the  low-income   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   My  officers  will  certainly  work   with   the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of Statistics to refine the data on  retiree  and\r\n\r\nlow-income  households, so that we get accurate  data.   With\r\n\r\naccurate  data, we will be able to assist low-income families\r\n\r\nmore effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that the less educated\r\n\r\nworkers,  especially older employees, are very vulnerable  to\r\n\r\nretrenchment  and slower re-employment.  The recent  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn  shows this very starkly.  Dr Vasoo spoke at  length\r\n\r\nabout  this problem.  These people need to keep their  skills\r\n\r\nrelevant  through  continuous  learning  and  upgrading,  and\r\n\r\nhelping  them  to  remain employable  is  a  priority  of  my\r\n\r\nMinistry.  The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund will help the\r\n\r\nlower skilled by subsidising relevant skills programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will complement these efforts by enhancing\r\n\r\nthe social safety net for families in difficulty.  Indeed,  a\r\n\r\nrange  of  resources for social assistance has been built  up\r\n\r\nover  the  years  and, together with the private  and  people\r\n\r\nsectors,  we  will  do  more.  Those  in  need  of  long-term\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance can turn to Public Assistance (PA).   PA\r\n\r\nrecipients  not only get financial assistance, but  they  get\r\n\r\nother  assistance too.  This is, I think, something  which  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  people do not know.  For example, PA recipients  get\r\n\r\nfree medical attention at the polyclinics, and many charities\r\n\r\nalso,  over and above the PA amounts, regularly provide  them\r\n\r\nwith  assistance,  either in cash or in  kind.   My  Ministry\r\n\r\nregularly reviews the various schemes to align them with  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of the recipients.  In January this year, we increased\r\n\r\nthe PA rates by between 15% and 32%, and we will continue  to\r\n\r\nreview this according to the cost and standard of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the churn and uncertainties of the new economy\r\n\r\nmean   that  there  is  an  increasing  need  for  short-term\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance, to help families tide  over  difficult\r\n\r\nperiods,  either due to retrenchment, illness or  slower  re-employment.  To meet this need, we will merge two  charitable\r\n\r\nfunds that we have now, ie, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n25th  Anniversary  Endowment  Fund  and  the  Silver  Jubilee\r\n\r\n(Singapore)  Fund,  into  a  new endowment  fund  called  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Assistance Fund (CAF).  The Government will  inject\r\n\r\na  further $200 million into the Community Assistance Fund on\r\n\r\n1st  April  this year.  The interest from the CAF  will  fund\r\n\r\nvarious short-term assistance schemes, such as the Rental and\r\n\r\nUtilities   Assistance   Scheme  (RUAS),   the   Centre-based\r\n\r\nFinancial Assistance for Childcare and Back-to-Work Childcare\r\n\r\nSchemes,  and  the Short-term (Interim) Financial  Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme.   These  schemes would provide short  term  financial\r\n\r\nassistance in the community.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from financial assistance, social workers from\r\n\r\nfamily service centres will work with needy families to  help\r\n\r\nthem  address related social problems and acquire  the  life-skills needed for them to stand on their own feet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing educational and developmental opportunities to\r\n\r\nchildren   from  low  income  families  is  another  critical\r\n\r\nstrategy   in   breaking  the  poverty  cycle.   School-going\r\n\r\nchildren already receive various forms of assistance from the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education.  There is also a range of free tuition\r\n\r\nprogrammes  run  by  self-help groups  and  other  charitable\r\n\r\norganisations.  No child in Singapore, I repeat, no child  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  is  deprived  of  an  education  for  reasons  of\r\n\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many studies show that quality childhood programmes can\r\n\r\nhelp  improve the development and functional achievements  of\r\n\r\nchildren,   especially  those  from  disadvantaged  families.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my Ministry will help ensure affordable  childcare\r\n\r\nservices  for  low income families.  At the same  time,  this\r\n\r\nallows their mothers to work, and therefore, also boost their\r\n\r\nfamily income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently have two specific financial assistance\r\n\r\nschemes to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  One\r\n\r\nis the Centre-based Financial Assistance for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChildcare  (CFAC).  The second is the Back-to-Work  Childcare\r\n\r\nScheme.   The CFAC helps subsidise childcare fees of children\r\n\r\nfrom  low-income families by between $50-$200 a month,  while\r\n\r\nthe Back-to-Work scheme gives a one-time grant to pay for the\r\n\r\ncosts   of   entering  childcare,  such  as   fee   deposits,\r\n\r\nregistration fees and uniforms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st April this year, MCDS will step up the subsidy\r\n\r\nlevels of the CFAC to between $150-$230 a month for the first\r\n\r\ntwo  children  of  low income families.   Together  with  the\r\n\r\nuniversal  childcare  subsidy of  $150  and  funds  from  the\r\n\r\nChildren Development Co-savings (or Baby Bonus) Scheme, which\r\n\r\nwill be having the Second and Third readings soon, low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies  will not need to pay more than 5%-25% of  childcare\r\n\r\nfees for the first two children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee has pointed out that part of the\r\n\r\neffective  delivery  of social services  is  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\npeople  know where to get help when they need it.  We  agree.\r\n\r\nOften  enough, our experience has been that the  very  people\r\n\r\nwho  need the help are the most difficult people to reach and\r\n\r\ncertainly  we will look at ways to try to reach them  better.\r\n\r\nThe  pilot scheme to delegate the administration of financial\r\n\r\nassistance  schemes  from MCDS and the  National  Council  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Services  to  the  Marine Parade  and  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nCommunity   Development  Councils  (CDCs)  has  proven   very\r\n\r\nbeneficial.  CDCs, as you know, are closer to the ground  and\r\n\r\nthey  are  able  to exercise more flexibility  and  speed  in\r\n\r\nadvising  and  responding to the needs of their  constituents\r\n\r\nbecause they know what their constituents want, they know the\r\n\r\nsituation and the conditions of those living in the district.\r\n\r\nFrom  1st  April  this year, we will delegate  all  financial\r\n\r\nassistance schemes to the remaining CDCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me thank Dr Vasoo and Dr Ho Tat Kin for their\r\n\r\ninterest  on  eldercare issues.  I would like  to  provide  a\r\n\r\nconsolidated reply to both of them.  But allow  me  first  to\r\n\r\nreport generally on the implementation of the recommendations\r\n\r\nof  the  Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing Population\r\n\r\n(IMC for the Aged).  Progress\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmade on the implementation of the 78 IMC recommendations  has\r\n\r\nbeen  good.   Overall, about 75% of the recommendations  have\r\n\r\nseen significant progress in implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of providing community-based services, MCDS\r\n\r\nrecently  announced  its  new $93  million  5-year  Eldercare\r\n\r\nMasterplan for FY2001-FY2005. The formulation of the plan was\r\n\r\nguided  by two key policy considerations.  One, the  emphasis\r\n\r\non  the  social  integration of our senior  citizens.   Older\r\n\r\npeople  should age gracefully in the community, and  continue\r\n\r\nto  be  valued as contributing members of society, and  there\r\n\r\nare programmes under the plan to engage our healthy elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the family will continue to be the first line of\r\n\r\nsupport in the care of our aged.  My Ministry, together  with\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health, will ensure that more attention  and\r\n\r\nsupport  will  be  given  to  care-givers,  in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nservices, information and training.  We will seek to  provide\r\n\r\nintegrated, accessible and affordable services to the elderly\r\n\r\nand their care-givers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the care of our aged requires a coordinated and\r\n\r\nconcerted effort of the Government, as well as all sectors of\r\n\r\nour  society  - the people and private sectors,  the  elderly\r\n\r\nthemselves and their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to help the VWOs set up\r\n\r\neldercare facilities through acquiring suitable premises  and\r\n\r\nproviding  capital  funding for new facilities.   We  provide\r\n\r\nclear  guidelines to VWOs on the provision of these services.\r\n\r\nMore  significantly, from 1st April 2001, we will revise  the\r\n\r\nfunding  framework  to  lighten  the  VWOs'  burden  of  fund\r\n\r\nraising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is currently studying two key measures to\r\n\r\nencourage and facilitate the entry of private operators  into\r\n\r\nthe  eldercare sector.  First, we will be  building  purpose-built   facilities   for  subsidised  rental   to   eldercare\r\n\r\nproviders, or to private operators, at market rates.  Second,\r\n\r\nwe will fund the majority of eldercare services on per capita\r\n\r\nbasis.  We envisage moving eventually to a means-tested user-subsidy system where an elderly can receive a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubsidy, regardless of which service provider he or she  goes\r\n\r\nto.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will ensure that the number of facilities planned is\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  meet the demand.  The needs  of  the  various\r\n\r\ngroups  of  elderly will be assessed regularly  and  we  will\r\n\r\nadjust  the supply of services accordingly.  Where  possible,\r\n\r\nthe  facilities for eldercare services will be co-located  in\r\n\r\nmulti-service centres, together with services for  other  age\r\n\r\ngroups  such as childcare centres.  This will promote  inter-generational interaction and convenience for the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry, together with NCSS, has developed a\r\n\r\nprogramme  evaluation  system  to  evaluate  programmes   and\r\n\r\nservices  based  on  a set of output and outcome  indicators.\r\n\r\nThis, we hope, will help raise the standards in the eldercare\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho pointed out that it is important to make available\r\n\r\nadequately-trained manpower. We will work with NCSS  and  the\r\n\r\nservice  providers  to  identify the training  needs  of  the\r\n\r\neldercare  industry.   We plan to work with  the  educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions  such as the polytechnics and  ITEs  to  develop\r\n\r\nsuitable training modules for new entrants to this field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important human resource is our elderly volunteers\r\n\r\nthemselves.   Over the next five years, we  will  expand  the\r\n\r\navenues  available for our seniors to contribute their  time,\r\n\r\nenergy and experience.  Resources will be given to promote an\r\n\r\nactive  volunteer movement and mutual help among our seniors.\r\n\r\nMy Ministry will also work with NCSS to look into measures to\r\n\r\nbetter support and sustain the interests of these volunteers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin mentioned the issue of employment for\r\n\r\nolder  people.  Sir, the continual employment of  our  senior\r\n\r\nworkers  remains a key challenge to the Government.  We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to work with the Ministry of Manpower to help  older\r\n\r\nworkers.   I  am pleased to inform the House that  the  first\r\n\r\nGolden  Manpower  Centre  is being  piloted  at  the  Central\r\n\r\nSingapore   CDC.    The   Centre   sources   for   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities for those more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthan  55  years old at the community level, and works towards\r\n\r\nchanging mindsets of employers, vis-a-vis, the employment  of\r\n\r\nolder  people.  It also links up with training facilities  to\r\n\r\nsource for appropriate training opportunities for people  who\r\n\r\nregister with them.  If the GMC pilot is successful, we  will\r\n\r\ncertainly look into the feasibility of extending the  concept\r\n\r\nmore widely in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will continue to monitor the need for community-based services for the elderly. My Ministry will also\r\n\r\ncontinue to follow-up with the implementing agencies  on  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of the Inter-Ministerial Committee  for  the\r\n\r\nAged.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, point of clarification. I had\r\n\r\nearlier  asked the Minister on the criteria in  which  Public\r\n\r\nAssistance  is  given  to  needy  families.   The  underlying\r\n\r\nprinciple in respect of extending Public Assistance to  needy\r\n\r\nfamilies  is one of basic necessity.  I have made  the  point\r\n\r\nearlier  that  the definition of basic necessity  may  change\r\n\r\nover  time.  Is the acquisition of IT equipment, IT  lessons,\r\n\r\nmusic lessons or dance lessons a luxury or a basic necessity?\r\n\r\nParents  these  days  would want to enrich  their  children's\r\n\r\nlives  as much as possible.  Is it unreasonable for a  family\r\n\r\nfrom a lower income group to want to extend these benefits to\r\n\r\ntheir  children?  Can they rely on Public Assistance to  help\r\n\r\ntheir children attain these skill sets?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, it is reasonable for us not\r\n\r\nto  include activities like music lessons, ballet lessons  or\r\n\r\nIT  lessons  to recipients of Public Assistance.  After  all,\r\n\r\nthe  very  concept of the assistance itself is  to  help  the\r\n\r\ndestitute,  ie, those who are unable to get  an  income.   It\r\n\r\nwould  not be right for us to go into supporting or financing\r\n\r\nactivities  like IT lessons, dance lessons or  music  lessons\r\n\r\nfor  such  families.   If children of  such  families  go  to\r\n\r\nschool,  and if these are provided in the school, the  school\r\n\r\nwill definitely be helping the children from such families to\r\n\r\nattend these lessons and activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I recall asking the Minister to\r\n\r\ncomment  on  the rising trend of PA cases.  I do  not  recall\r\n\r\nhearing a response.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Charles Chong did ask that\r\n\r\nquestion.   I  will  give him some statistics  on  the  cases\r\n\r\napproved.   In  1998, we approved 2,246 cases;  in  1999,  we\r\n\r\napproved  2,295,  and  last year,  we  approved  2,603.   The\r\n\r\npossible  cause of this is the economic recession  when  more\r\n\r\nmembers  supporting the aged dependants find it difficult  to\r\n\r\ndo  so, especially during this period.  The ageing population\r\n\r\nis  also  a  factor in explaining this rise in the number  of\r\n\r\npeople who have asked for PA and we will monitor the numbers.\r\n\r\nAs  I mentioned earlier, we review the amounts we give to our\r\n\r\nPA  recipients and we adjust them according to  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving as appropriate at the moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, MCDS is currently\r\n\r\nactively  encouraging Singaporeans to have more babies.   The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  also announced the baby bonus  to  encourage\r\n\r\nyoung  couples  to  have  second and  third  babies.   In  my\r\n\r\ndialogue  with the people, I found out why they did not  want\r\n\r\nto have babies. One of the questions asked was, \"Who is going\r\n\r\nto  look  after my baby?\"  Apart from help from the  extended\r\n\r\nfamily  or hiring a maid, the provision of childcare services\r\n\r\nis the best solution.  I would like to ask the Minister three\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what is the projected number of childcare centres\r\n\r\nwhich  will be needed in the next three years?  Is there  any\r\n\r\nplan  to  build  new  childcare centres?   Second,  will  the\r\n\r\nMinistry set up childcare centres in community centres in the\r\n\r\nconstituency?   In  my  constituency, childcare  centres  are\r\n\r\nsited  in  the  community centres.  This will  make  it  more\r\n\r\nconvenient  to the young couples.  Third, will  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  setting  up infant centres for babies  between  the\r\n\r\nages of 18 months and two years?  If not, why not?\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the traditional style of weddings seems to be out\r\n\r\nof fashion among the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyoung couples nowadays.  Instead, we have various packages to\r\n\r\nattract  the  young people.  Young people think that  getting\r\n\r\nmarried entails a lot of trouble and expenses.  They have  to\r\n\r\ngive dinners in a big ballroom in a hotel.  Friends have told\r\n\r\nme  that  young people nowadays do not want to  get  married,\r\n\r\nbecause of the high expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there was an English friend who came to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  He told me that there are many single persons and\r\n\r\nunmarried  mothers in England today.  I hope  this  will  not\r\n\r\nhappen  in  Singapore.   Therefore, I would  urge  our  young\r\n\r\npeople to get married before they have babies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make the following suggestions in\r\n\r\norder  to encourage young couples to get married.  They  need\r\n\r\nnot spend a lot of money in planning for their weddings.    I\r\n\r\nhope  MCDS will conduct mass weddings for the young  couples.\r\n\r\nThis  is  quite popular in Taiwan and China.  We can  conduct\r\n\r\nmass  weddings during Valentine's Day, June and  August,  and\r\n\r\nalso  arrange  for  honeymoon cruise tours  for  these  young\r\n\r\ncouples, with MCDS footing part of the bill.  After they  are\r\n\r\nmarried, and if they have babies during the first two  years,\r\n\r\nthe  Government should give them a special ang pow  of  $888.\r\n\r\nIn  this  way,  this will encourage them to have  second  and\r\n\r\nthird babies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also encourage Government departments and the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector to grant one week's paid leave to the husband\r\n\r\nin  order  to  keep  the wife company during  her  post-natal\r\n\r\nconfinement.  HDB could also hasten the process of allocating\r\n\r\nthe   flats they applied for.  Newly-wed couples normally  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  much  money.   Therefore, HDB  should  reduce  the\r\n\r\nquantum  of  deposit  to  10%,  and  payable  in  two   equal\r\n\r\ninstalments of 5% each, and the rest can be repayable in  25-30  years.   Therefore,  encouraging  young  couples  to  get\r\n\r\nmarried  should not be the responsibility of MCDS alone.   It\r\n\r\nshould  be  the  joint responsibility of  the  Ministries  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development, Manpower, Education  and  so  on.   We\r\n\r\nshould have an Inter-Ministerial committee to work on how  to\r\n\r\nencourage young people to get married.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is this. I have not been to the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Marriages (ROM) for the last 20 years.  Recently,\r\n\r\nMCDS  arranged for members of the GPC to visit  the  ROM.   I\r\n\r\nfound the building to be very old and very crowded, and there\r\n\r\nis a lack of romantic atmosphere in the building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our HDB flats have been upgraded and many Government\r\n\r\nbuildings have been upgraded.  Our Parliament House has  also\r\n\r\nbeen rebuilt.  I would like to ask the Minister whether there\r\n\r\nis  a  plan to build a new Registry of Marriages, to  provide\r\n\r\nmore  space,  more romantic surroundings, so that  our  young\r\n\r\ncouples can invite their friends and relatives there to share\r\n\r\nthe most memorable moment in their lives with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I feel\r\n\r\nthat  if we were to give a wedding ang pow, it should not  be\r\n\r\njust  $888  but  $999.  In Chinese, the  figure  \"9\"  depicts\r\n\r\neternity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New technology and the widespread use of IT has changed\r\n\r\nthe  way we work, and has tremendously increased the pace  of\r\n\r\nwork.   At  the same time, intense competition has  compelled\r\n\r\ncompanies  to reduce cost, by maintaining a leaner  workforce\r\n\r\nand  thus  increasing the workload of the existing employees.\r\n\r\nThe  worst  is that, with all these changes taking  place  at\r\n\r\nwork  and because of our ageing population, all these  people\r\n\r\nwho  work very hard in their office will have to take on  the\r\n\r\nadditional  responsibility of taking care  of  their  elderly\r\n\r\nfolks  and  raising young children as well.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nall  our  working people will have to acquire  the  necessary\r\n\r\nknowledge and skills to cope with all these changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, there must be more willingness on the\r\n\r\npart of the employers to explore initiatives such as flexible\r\n\r\nwork  arrangements and adopt pro-family work practices.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  there  is a necessity for our employers  to  extend\r\n\r\nchildcare  sick  leave to the male employees  to  look  after\r\n\r\ntheir children who are sick.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, on its part, should consider innovative\r\n\r\nways to provide incentives and motivate companies to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadopt such pro-family practices.  While we should not try  to\r\n\r\nlegislate  for  pro-family practices  at  the  workplace,  we\r\n\r\nshould examine the existing laws to see whether there is  any\r\n\r\nprovision  therein  that  would encourage  our  companies  to\r\n\r\nprovide  such pro-family practices.  I hope that  MCDS  would\r\n\r\nencourage the media to support and give more publicity on pro-family   practices,  to  create  better  awareness  of   such\r\n\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister, besides the\r\n\r\nFamily  Friendly Firm Award, what measures would the Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  to  effectively encourage  more  companies  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  to  implement work  options  and  pro-family\r\n\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, it is great to hear Mr Ang and Mr\r\n\r\nYeo  speak in support of the family.  For today, I would like\r\n\r\nto focus just on one subject, one that is of great concern to\r\n\r\nfamilies  with young children, which is childcare  or  child-minding arrangements.  Dr Vasoo also earlier spoke of helping\r\n\r\nto  facilitate young couples live close to their  parents  in\r\n\r\nHDB  estates,  and  that is one aspect  of  it,  because  the\r\n\r\nassistance  of grandparents in supervising childcare  is  one\r\n\r\npossible solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On childcare centres, many families are already sending\r\n\r\ntheir  kids  to  childcare centres.  I think  the  acceptance\r\n\r\nlevel has increased a lot over the years.  And, increasingly,\r\n\r\nthere is also an added demand for infant care cases, and this\r\n\r\nis  a  need that should be addressed.  But number of  centres\r\n\r\nand places aside, the fees that you have to pay for child and\r\n\r\ninfant  care  can take a significant bite out of the  average\r\n\r\nfamily's  income,  particularly if you  have  more  than  one\r\n\r\nchild.  So the ability to use baby bonus dollars towards fees\r\n\r\nwill certainly be most helpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from institutional care, however, there are also\r\n\r\nless  structured  child  minding  arrangements  that  already\r\n\r\nexist,  to  some  extent,  in the community.   Some  families\r\n\r\nfoster out the kids during the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nweekdays  to  bring  them  home on  weekends.   In  addition,\r\n\r\nsuggestions have been raised on developing neighbourhood baby\r\n\r\nsitting  networks,  which  can do child-minding  on  a  daily\r\n\r\nbasis.   If  these  can be organised, it  will  not  only  be\r\n\r\nhelpful for working parents, it would also bring income to  a\r\n\r\ngroup of women who would otherwise be unemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment for these services would also surely be a\r\n\r\nlegitimate use of the baby bonus account.  If we can put  all\r\n\r\nof  these things together and help with the fees that parents\r\n\r\nwill  have to bear, they will surely give families the  wider\r\n\r\nrange  of  childcare and child-minding options  possible,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can come to arrangements that will best suit their\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to thank Members for their concern  on  family\r\n\r\nissues.   We  all  know that strong and stable  families  are\r\n\r\nimportant for social cohesion and nation building.   To  help\r\n\r\nnurture  such  families, the Government,  together  with  the\r\n\r\npeople sector, had been providing resources, promoting family\r\n\r\nvalues,  sharing  knowledge and skills for family  life,  and\r\n\r\ngiving support services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me explain, first, providing resources. Many\r\n\r\nfamilies struggle with the lack of two critical resources   - time  and  money.  Many parents say that they face the  \"time\r\n\r\nbind\".   This  is  very true in a new economy  where  we  are\r\n\r\nexpected to work longer and faster, and upgrade continuously.\r\n\r\nTo  help  such families, my Ministry has set up the Work-Life\r\n\r\nUnit  last September to promote family-friendly practices  in\r\n\r\nthe workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked about the measures that my\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  considering  to  promote  family-friendly  work\r\n\r\npractices.   We  have made quite substantial progress.   MCDS\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministry  of  Manpower, the National  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress  and  the  Singapore National Employers'  Federation\r\n\r\nhave formed a Tripartite Committee on Work-Life Strategy.  It\r\n\r\nsets  directions  and promotes  pro-family  practice  at  the\r\n\r\nworkplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower is reviewing the Employment Act\r\n\r\nwhich,  among  other things, will also examine  the  existing\r\n\r\nlegislation   to   ensure  that  it  will  not   impede   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of family-friendly practices  that  would  be\r\n\r\nadopted for family-friendly practices in the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, MCDS has conducted 17 sharing and training\r\n\r\nsessions on work-life strategies to more than 2,000 employers\r\n\r\nand  human  resource practitioners.  We will continue  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.  We have also leveraged on family-friendly champions to\r\n\r\nhelp  persuade  employers  that  it  is  in  their  business'\r\n\r\ninterest  to  help their employees find ways  to  manage  the\r\n\r\n\"time bind\".  For instance, the Nominated Member, Dr Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee,  is  also a champion in this area.  If employees  cannot\r\n\r\nmanage their work and family commitments well, they cannot be\r\n\r\nproductive at the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry and the Public Education Committee on the\r\n\r\nFamily, which I am chairing, are already working closely with\r\n\r\nthe  community and the media to generate publicity  on  work-life  issues.  We will continue to work with the media.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  we  have an excellent partnership with the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes on a regular 24 x 7 Life column every Tuesday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the multi-pronged approach that we are taking,\r\n\r\nemployers will progressively buy the need to create a family-friendly  work culture.  So far, NTUC has been supportive  in\r\n\r\npromoting family life.  I urge Mr Yeo Guat Kwang to  join  us\r\n\r\nin this call to create family-friendly workplaces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me explain what my Ministry is doing to\r\n\r\ninculcate  values.  We seek to work in partnership  with  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  community to promote family  values,  especially\r\n\r\namongst  our  young.  The Public Education Committee  on  the\r\n\r\nFamily  (PEC) has a special focus on getting our young people\r\n\r\nto  marry  and have more children.  We are very pleased  that\r\n\r\nthe  people sector has stepped forward to help address common\r\n\r\nconcerns.   We thank the Workgroup Chairman and  members  for\r\n\r\nworking  so  hard, as well as the media and  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic for their enthusiastic support.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise that decisions on marriage, procreation\r\n\r\nand  the  family  are  private  matters  of  the  individual.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  we  must want to marry and have children  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  we  want  to.   We must also  be  realistic  and  be\r\n\r\nprepared for the responsibilities and the commitment involved\r\n\r\nin keeping a marriage fulfilling and in raising a child well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last six months, the PEC has been actively\r\n\r\nreviewing  how  we can strengthen the Singapore  family.   We\r\n\r\nwill finalise our recommendations by July this year.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to my third point, that is, sharing knowledge\r\n\r\nand  skills  of family life.  Public education  is  not  just\r\n\r\nabout  influencing values and attitudes.  It  is  also  about\r\n\r\nsharing tips on how to live our roles as couples and parents.\r\n\r\nWe  will  explore  innovative ways to  reach  various  target\r\n\r\ngroups,  for  example, developing an interactive family  life\r\n\r\nwebsite,  developing more real life stories on TV, radio  and\r\n\r\nmedia, bringing mobile kits to workplaces, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October last year, MCDS launched the Family Life\r\n\r\nAmbassador  (FLA)  programme  to  build  resources   in   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.    The   FLA  programme  is   a   partnership   of\r\n\r\nindividuals,  civic  groups, schools, businesses,  Government\r\n\r\nand  private  organisations to promote and  implement  family\r\n\r\nlife  education  programme.  It  aims  to  make  family  life\r\n\r\neducation more accessible and convenient to everyone.   Since\r\n\r\nOctober  last  year,  we  have  appointed  227  family   life\r\n\r\nambassadors.  These FLAs have been organising events,  talks,\r\n\r\nseminars  as  well  as  distributing  family  life  education\r\n\r\nmaterials.   We  will  be appointing another  batch  of  FLAs\r\n\r\nduring the National Family Week in May this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me come to my fourth point - giving support\r\n\r\nservices.  Sir, as I have mentioned earlier, building a total\r\n\r\nsocial  environment  conducive to  raising  a  family  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  goal of my Ministry.  A key programme is  to  have\r\n\r\ngood quality childcare centres which are accessible.  Mr  Ang\r\n\r\nMong Seng asked about the demand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  supply  of  childcare places.   Enrolment  in  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres  has  increased from 33,000 to 35,200 over  the  last\r\n\r\nthree years.  With the trend towards dual income families and\r\n\r\nthe  injection  of fund from the baby bonus  into  the  early\r\n\r\nchildhood industry, MCDS forecasts that the demand for places\r\n\r\nin  childcare centres will increase.  My Ministry pledged  in\r\n\r\nAugust  last year to increase the number of childcare  places\r\n\r\nby  25%, from 46,000 to 58,000 over the next three years.  We\r\n\r\nhave  already seen an increase of 28 new centres in the  last\r\n\r\nsix months providing nearly 2,400 more places.  We expect  to\r\n\r\nsee 60 new centres by end of FY2001.  For FY2002 and 2003, we\r\n\r\nexpect  to  develop another 50 centres a year.   This  should\r\n\r\nincrease the number of childcare centre places to our  58,000\r\n\r\ntarget by FY2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has delegated social service functions to\r\n\r\nthe Community Development Councils or CDCs.  Mr Ang mentioned\r\n\r\nabout setting up childcare centres in community clubs.   CDCs\r\n\r\nare  in  the  best  position to decide  on  the  location  of\r\n\r\nchildcare centres and how these centres best serve the  needs\r\n\r\nof the local community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that the increase in the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  childcare places would not be at the  expense  of\r\n\r\nquality.   MCDS  has  also  put  in  place  a  new  licensing\r\n\r\ninstrument  for  childcare centres to improve their  quality.\r\n\r\nThe  criteria  of  assessment  of  centres  are  transparent,\r\n\r\nholistic and comprehensive.  Centres find it useful in  their\r\n\r\npreparation  for  licence renewal and in maintaining  quality\r\n\r\nchildcare programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new Joint Teacher and Accreditation Framework\r\n\r\nintroduced   together  with  MOE  recently,  all   pre-school\r\n\r\nteachers  and supervisors will be required to be  trained  in\r\n\r\nthe  Certificate in Pre-School Teaching and  the  Diploma  in\r\n\r\nLeadership respectively.  Currently, 82% of the teachers meet\r\n\r\nthe  training  requirement.  By the year 2004, MCDS  requires\r\n\r\nall  supervisors and at least one teacher in a centre  to  be\r\n\r\nDiploma trained.  I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nam  happy  to report that reception by the childcare industry\r\n\r\nhas  been  positive.  This will further raise the quality  of\r\n\r\npre-school education in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang, as well as Dr Jennifer Lee, has asked about the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of  infant care centres.  We have  reviewed  the\r\n\r\nlicensing requirements to facilitate the setting up  of  such\r\n\r\ncentres.  There are currently seven centres providing  infant\r\n\r\ncare  service.  Although it is generally believed  that  home\r\n\r\ncare  is  best  for infants for bonding between  parents  and\r\n\r\nchild, MCDS will facilitate the provision of this service  if\r\n\r\nsuitable operators wish to set up infant care centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee asked about the promotion of a formal\r\n\r\ncare arrangement.  Family-based care for infants is an option\r\n\r\nonce  used  by  parents  who  prefer  closer  attention   and\r\n\r\nsupervision  of  their children.  CDCs are already  providing\r\n\r\nsuch  a  service for their residents.  We can help to promote\r\n\r\nthis  further through registration and matching of users  and\r\n\r\ncaregivers  at  the  local level.  We are looking  into  some\r\n\r\nbasic  training  for caregivers.  But we  should  allow  this\r\n\r\ninformal service to grow without too much regulation.  As for\r\n\r\nsubsidy,  they  should go to the end-user and  not  the  care\r\n\r\nprovider.   Part of the baby bonus scheme will  be  given  as\r\n\r\ndirect cash grant and may be used to cover such expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has made a number of proposals to\r\n\r\npromote marriages and procreation.  With regard to organising\r\n\r\na  group wedding package, Mr Ang may be pleased to know  that\r\n\r\nMCDS  and  People's Association are supporting an  effort  by\r\n\r\nTimes  Periodicals of Singapore Press Holdings to organise  a\r\n\r\nMass  Wedding  2001 in September this year.  I  hope  he  can\r\n\r\nencourage more couples to join in this wedding.  There is  no\r\n\r\nnecessity  for  the Government to organise  mass  wedding  or\r\n\r\nhoneymoon packages.  The private sector and community will be\r\n\r\nin  a  better position to promote such programmes.   As  some\r\n\r\nwedding  expenses are optional, we will continue to encourage\r\n\r\ncouples, through public education, to spend on what is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnecessary  to go for the marriage of their lifetime  and  not\r\n\r\nwedding of the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang also suggested that we should look into the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of a new ROM.  Mr Ang would be pleased  to  know\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  actively  looking into new  premises  for  the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of Marriages and the Registry of Muslim  Marriages.\r\n\r\nApart  from  a  conducive garden setting  befitting  such  an\r\n\r\nimportant occasion, we also make sure that we will try to  be\r\n\r\nromantic  as  possible.  Our concept is also to  co-locate  a\r\n\r\nresource  centre for the family.  As for couples who  want  a\r\n\r\nflat early so that their wedding plans could proceed earlier,\r\n\r\nMr Ang is requested to refer such couples to HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang has proposed lowering the downpayment for new\r\n\r\nflats.   MAS has set the mortgage financing limit at  80%  of\r\n\r\nthe purchase price or valuation of the property, whichever is\r\n\r\nlower.    This  limit  is  for  financial  prudence  and   to\r\n\r\ndiscourage couples from buying a flat bigger than their needs\r\n\r\nor  means.  To further assist young couples, HDB has  allowed\r\n\r\nthose buying a new 4-room flat to pay the downpayment through\r\n\r\nstaggered downpayment scheme.  The couple need only pay a 10%\r\n\r\ndownpayment  upon  signing  the  agreement  for  lease.   The\r\n\r\nremaining 10% will have to be paid only when they are  called\r\n\r\nto collect the keys to the flat which may be one to two years\r\n\r\nlater.   Thus, there is no need to lower the downpayment  for\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang has also suggested giving incentives to couples\r\n\r\nhaving  their  first  child within the  first  two  years  of\r\n\r\nmarriage.  According to feedback, we learn that generally our\r\n\r\nyoung  couples  can manage financially for the  first  child.\r\n\r\nAfter  their second or third child, they may have  a  bit  of\r\n\r\nproblem.   The  baby bonus however would help  these  couples\r\n\r\nwith  their  second and third child.  Mr Ang has  recommended\r\n\r\ngiving  one week's paternity leave to fathers.  He  would  be\r\n\r\npleased  to know that since last October, male civil servants\r\n\r\nare  eligible for three days' paternity leave.  Many  private\r\n\r\nsector companies already provide paternity leave or even sick\r\n\r\nleave  for the parents to help their children.  We  hope  the\r\n\r\nrest would follow suit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the future for the family in Singapore is both\r\n\r\nchallenging   and  exciting.   Challenging  because   tension\r\n\r\nbrought about by modern living could place a strain on family\r\n\r\nlife.   Exciting  because  my Ministry  has  built  a  strong\r\n\r\npartnership  with  both the private and people  sectors,  and\r\n\r\ntogether we are putting in place many services and programmes\r\n\r\nthat  will make Singapore one of the best places to  raise  a\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Sir, the disabled and the elderly\r\n\r\nare  an  integral part of our society.  They do not need  our\r\n\r\nsympathy.     They   only   need   our   understanding    and\r\n\r\nconsideration.  I have four suggestions for the Minister:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For many disabled people and the elderly,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  who  have  severe  physical  disabilities,\r\n\r\nengaging  a  foreign  maid is something  they  could  not  do\r\n\r\nwithout.   The maids help in the activities of daily  living,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  bathing, toileting, cooking, feeding and  movement.\r\n\r\nMost  of  these severely disabled are usually unemployed  and\r\n\r\nare  dependent on their family members for financial support.\r\n\r\nHowever, the cost of employing and maintaining a maid is very\r\n\r\nhigh and is unaffordable to many deserving cases.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  hope MCDS will coordinate with the Ministry of Manpower to\r\n\r\nconsider  waiving  or reducing the foreign  worker  levy  for\r\n\r\nmaids  employed by this group of people.  It may  not  be  an\r\n\r\nacross-the-board waiver or reduction, but on  a  case-by-case\r\n\r\nbasis.  To minimise any abuses and that only deserving  cases\r\n\r\nenjoy  such privileges, a certified assessment by a qualified\r\n\r\nmedical practitioner or a therapist must be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Disabled citizens spend a substantial amount of\r\n\r\ntheir  income  on medical fees, transport expenses,  mobility\r\n\r\naids,   like  wheelchair,  calipers,  etc.   Currently,   the\r\n\r\nhandicapped  earned income relief for a disabled taxpayer  of\r\n\r\nbelow  55 years is $2,000.  I propose for consideration  that\r\n\r\nthe  earned income relief be increased to $4,000 for disabled\r\n\r\ntaxpayers below 55 years.  Similarly, I would like to propose\r\n\r\nfor consideration that the handicapped\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndependent   spouse  relief,  handicapped  child  relief   and\r\n\r\nhandicapped  brother  and  sister relief  be  increased  from\r\n\r\n$3,500  to  $5,000.  This is on the same  rate  as  the  aged\r\n\r\nparent relief.  Financially, there is not much difference  in\r\n\r\nsupporting   a   handicapped  person  or  an   aged   parent.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it makes sense to adopt a uniform rate applicable\r\n\r\nto both reliefs.  I would like to ask MCDS to study the above\r\n\r\nsuggestion with the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) With the recent announcement by the Government to\r\n\r\nupgrade  all food centres and markets throughout the  island,\r\n\r\nmay  I  suggest  that provision be made to  ensure  that  all\r\n\r\nupgraded facilities be made family-friendly and accessible to\r\n\r\nthe  disabled,  the  elderly and babies  in  prams.   Besides\r\n\r\nproviding toilets with facilities for the handicapped,  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  gentle ramps and gradients for  the  less  mobile\r\n\r\npatrons.   The  spaces between the fixed  tables  and  stools\r\n\r\nshould  be  wide  enough  to  allow  children  in  prams  and\r\n\r\nwheelchair users to sit closer to the table.  Currently,  the\r\n\r\nfixed  tables and stools of many food centres are located  so\r\n\r\nclose  to one another that it is impossible or difficult  for\r\n\r\nchildren  in prams and wheelchair users to manoeuvre through.\r\n\r\nI  request MCDS to study this suggestion with MND to make the\r\n\r\nupgraded food centres more user-friendly to the disabled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) I have seen disabled people in wheelchairs playing\r\n\r\na form of football, mountain climbing, and I have even seen a\r\n\r\none-legged  skier.  With the current emphasis on  Sports  for\r\n\r\nLife for all Singaporeans, it is imperative that the needs of\r\n\r\nthe  disabled and the elderly for sporting activities are not\r\n\r\nmarginalised.    I  think  it  is  important  that   adequate\r\n\r\naccessibility  provisions must be made in all  public  sports\r\n\r\nfacilities, so that people with disabilities and the  elderly\r\n\r\ncan  participate  and/or patronise these areas.   This  would\r\n\r\nenable  them  to  keep themselves fit  and  healthy.   If  we\r\n\r\nincorporate such features during the planning stage, it would\r\n\r\ncertainly be less costlier than to revamp or renovate them at\r\n\r\na later stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I am speaking to the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  his  capacity as Minister  in-charge-of  Muslim\r\n\r\nAffairs.   It is a bit odd to be speaking just after  Mr  Goh\r\n\r\nChong Chia who spoke about the disabled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me compliment the Minister and the Malay-Muslim MPs for taking this initiative to want to lead the\r\n\r\nMalay-Muslim community to face new challenges in the KBE era.\r\n\r\nMy  view  is that the Malay-Muslims now face a challenge  far\r\n\r\nlarger than they have ever faced before.  This requires three\r\n\r\nvery important things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It requires enormous financial resources which as a\r\n\r\nminority community we are very short of;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A major change of mindset, one that focuses on the\r\n\r\nfuture, one that focuses on new challenges and opportunities;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) We need structural and organisational changes within\r\n\r\nthe  Malay-Muslim community.  This is where I want  to  focus\r\n\r\nsome of my thoughts today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen how, through the mosque building fund, the\r\n\r\nMalay  community  has been able to raise huge  mosques  which\r\n\r\nresulted  in all kinds of activities, not only religious  but\r\n\r\nsocial and educational activities in mosques.  It has brought\r\n\r\nabout   a  wealth  of  infrastructure  for  the  Malay-Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  that  we should all be proud of.   But  this  came\r\n\r\nabout because of the resources that are behind it.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nwe  have  seen how the establishment of the AMP  and  Mendaki\r\n\r\nresulted   in   an  entire  upliftment  of  the   educational\r\n\r\nachievement  of  the Malay-Muslim community.   And  something\r\n\r\nelse that is far more important is that the Malay-Muslims now\r\n\r\nrealise  education is the primary and most  important  factor\r\n\r\nthat will bring them forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we look at the challenges in the future, like I\r\n\r\nsaid, this is a far larger challenge that we have seen,  even\r\n\r\nfar  larger than mosque building fund, or setting up  Mendaki\r\n\r\nand AMP.  This is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhere I hope the Minister will consider looking into ways  in\r\n\r\nwhich the entire Malay-Muslim community could be restructured\r\n\r\nin  a way so that they provide some organisational capability\r\n\r\nto  make  sure that whatever programmes and schemes that  you\r\n\r\nare  going to introduce can be better executed.  By  this,  I\r\n\r\nmean two things.  One, perhaps as much as possible, a lot  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes  should be done in tandem and in association  with\r\n\r\nthe national programmes which have already infrastructure and\r\n\r\norganisational capability.  It is also part of, what we  have\r\n\r\ntalked  about the last few days - integration.  I  hope  this\r\n\r\nmust be the main thrust in the way we go forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is also a problem of duplication and\r\n\r\ncompetition amongst the Malay-Muslim organisations.   Already\r\n\r\nwe  are  short  of resources and if we carry on to  duplicate\r\n\r\nhaving different people competing with the kind of programmes\r\n\r\nthat they have, we are not going to achieve our objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than these two things, I hope the Minister could\r\n\r\nalso  enlighten  me and the House, ever since the  convention\r\n\r\nand  the publication of the report, what other resources  and\r\n\r\nsupport   is  the  Government  prepared  to  help  in   these\r\n\r\ninitiatives.    I  certainly  look  forward   to   a   better\r\n\r\nenlightened  response from the Government to make  sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  Malay-Muslim  community is  prepared  to  take  on  this\r\n\r\nenormous challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nSingapore 21 Report acts as a very important pillar, the idea\r\n\r\nof  active  citizenry.   To this end, last  year,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in July opened the National Volunteer Centre.   And\r\n\r\nin  his  opening speech, he mentioned that 74% of  those  who\r\n\r\nhave not volunteered for community work cited work and family\r\n\r\ncommitments as their main reason for not volunteering.   Also\r\n\r\nmentioned   in  the  speech  was  that  less  than   10%   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are volunteers, as compared to 25% in Japan  and\r\n\r\nover 50% in the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this problem has to be tackled quite seriously if\r\n\r\nactive citizenry is going to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nan  important  concept in Singapore 21.   And  we  should  be\r\n\r\ntargeting the  young working population - and if we do  that,\r\n\r\nthen  obviously the key is in the companies they are  working\r\n\r\nfor.   And  the  question  is how  public  spirited  are  the\r\n\r\ncompanies or the corporate sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of corporate social responsibility has at least\r\n\r\nthree  elements.  The  first is, of  course,  straightforward\r\n\r\nphilanthropy,  that  is for financial support  for  community\r\n\r\nprojects.   Many  companies  do  support  this.   The  second\r\n\r\nelement is to allow their workers, employees to have time off\r\n\r\nto  do  charitable or community work, to be involved  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  But the third element, the element that I do  not\r\n\r\nsee much of, is to take into account the social work that  is\r\n\r\ndone  by employees in actually assessing the quality of their\r\n\r\nemployees  for  the  purposes of promotion  or  upgrading  in\r\n\r\nsalaries, and so on.  These are very important concepts  that\r\n\r\nhave to be taken into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask whether MCDS has actually taken\r\n\r\nsteps  to involve the corporate sector to increase the social\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the corporate  sector in the building up of\r\n\r\nan  active  citizenry.  Has there been  an  improvement,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  in  the  number  of volunteers  in  Singapore  and,\r\n\r\nparticularly, has there been an improvement in the number  of\r\n\r\nyoung workers in the volunteer movement in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Members\r\n\r\nfor  their contributions.  Let me first address Mr Goh  Chong\r\n\r\nChia's  question on the help that he thinks the disabled  and\r\n\r\nthe  elderly will need.  Sir, I would agree with him that the\r\n\r\ndisabled  and  the  elderly  are  integral  members  of   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  We should not make it difficult for them to  live\r\n\r\nwithin the community because that is what we want them to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has called for more help for families with disabled\r\n\r\ndependants.  Sir, my Ministry works with the various VWOs  to\r\n\r\nset  up  social services and programmes to help persons  with\r\n\r\ndisabilities to integrate with the community and support\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamilies  in their care responsibilities.  MCDS and  NCSS  in\r\n\r\nfact heavily subsidise the services which range from day care\r\n\r\nactivity centres to residential homes providing both  respite\r\n\r\nand  long-term  care.  A family with elderly  dependants  can\r\n\r\nalso turn to equivalent facilities, such as day care centres,\r\n\r\nrespite care services and home care services, also funded  by\r\n\r\nMCDS  and  the National Council of Social Service.  From  1st\r\n\r\nApril this year, lower income families using elderly day care\r\n\r\ncentres will enjoy sliding scale subsidies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, families maintaining their parents or disabled\r\n\r\ndependants  are being helped with tax reliefs  already.   The\r\n\r\nsavings  from the tax reliefs, for example, $5,000  for  each\r\n\r\nelderly dependant, $3,500 for each disabled dependant  living\r\n\r\nwith  them  and $3,500 for each elderly dependant not  living\r\n\r\nwith  them,  could  partially offset the  cost  of  employing\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic  maids or workers to be  used  to  purchase\r\n\r\nother care services of professional care givers.  With regard\r\n\r\nto  whether tax reliefs could be increased or not, this would\r\n\r\nhave to depend on the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh has also asked that maids be made more accessible\r\n\r\nto encourage marriage and procreation.  Sir, engaging foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  maids, whether to look after children  or  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  disabled or the elderly, has been an issue  which\r\n\r\nhas  been  recurring.   But it is just one  of  several  care\r\n\r\ngiving options for family relief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to barrier-free accessibility, I understand\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry  of  National  Development  is  currently\r\n\r\nupdating the code on barrier-free accessibility in buildings.\r\n\r\nThis   we   feel  will  ensure  that  buildings  and   public\r\n\r\nfacilities, such as hawker centres mentioned by Mr Goh, would\r\n\r\nbe  accessible not only to physically disabled, but  also  to\r\n\r\nthe  elderly, to mothers with wheelchairs, pregnant  mothers,\r\n\r\netc. MND will continue to look further into this area and see\r\n\r\nwhether  it  could  make this area more accessible  to  these\r\n\r\nmembers of the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Mr Goh that sports should also be for\r\n\r\nthe disabled, just as it is for the able.  There is already a\r\n\r\nseparate organisation, I am not too sure whether Mr Goh knows\r\n\r\nabout  it, but there is the Singapore Sports Council for  the\r\n\r\nDisabled  (SSCD)  which looks precisely  after  the  sporting\r\n\r\nactivities and interests of persons with disabilities.  In FY\r\n\r\n2000,  for  example,  the SSCD received  $95,000  as  funding\r\n\r\nsupport from the Singapore Sports Council.  We will certainly\r\n\r\nbe  looking  into more ways to help the disabled  with  their\r\n\r\nsporting  activities and also to help them to  go  into  more\r\n\r\nsports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the code for barrier-free access, it is also now a\r\n\r\nstandard  equipment  or  requirement  that  all  new   sports\r\n\r\nfacilities be accessible to persons with disabilities.  These\r\n\r\nfacilities  include Bishan, Jurong East  and  Chua  Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nStadiums.   And over and above what is required by the  code,\r\n\r\nthese   facilities   have  reserved   spaces   for   disabled\r\n\r\nspectators, and these spaces are near the designated  parking\r\n\r\nlots  for  the disabled to make access easier for them.   The\r\n\r\nolder sports facilities that do not have such features as yet\r\n\r\nwill be made disabled-friendly when they are upgraded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin asked how we could prepare the\r\n\r\nMalay-Muslim community better for the new economy.   I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  Mr  Zulkifli about the seriousness of the challenge  of\r\n\r\nthe new economy to the community.  This is precisely what the\r\n\r\nMalay-Muslim MPs are worried about; which keeps us  awake  at\r\n\r\nnight.   We  feel  that the Malay community must  be  single-minded  and  serious  in  facing the challenges  of  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.   The  Malay-Muslim  organisations  must  coordinate\r\n\r\ntheir  efforts as well as leverage on the national programmes\r\n\r\nand  resources because it is no point re-inventing the  wheel\r\n\r\nand  set  up new organisations or new initiatives, when  they\r\n\r\nare available nationally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may wish to know that the KBE Facilitation\r\n\r\nCommittee  (FC), which is chaired by Dr Yaacob  Ibrahim,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  working closely, in fact several months now,  with  key\r\n\r\nMalay-Muslim organisations to identify critical programmes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich  meet the needs of the Malay community.  The  committee\r\n\r\ntook   into   account  the  existing  programmes   to   avoid\r\n\r\nduplication  of  efforts and it has proposed  at  the  moment\r\n\r\nthree  programmes.  One is a parent centre to be  managed  by\r\n\r\nthe Young Muslim Women Association (PPIS), and the other is a\r\n\r\nworker  mentoring scheme to be managed by Mendaki, and three,\r\n\r\nthe  IT  Student Development Programme to be managed  by  the\r\n\r\nMalay Youth Literary Society, or more popularly known as 4PM.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this programme has started already.  This initiative\r\n\r\nhas been incorporated into the Malay MPs' blueprint to uplift\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  community for which Government funding  is  being\r\n\r\nsought.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FC also launched the Technopreneurship Club, called\r\n\r\nMind  2000,  and  it also formed the Malay Internet  Steering\r\n\r\nCommittee.   These  two  bodies,  we  hope,  will  help   the\r\n\r\ncommunity better understand the challenges of the new economy\r\n\r\nand  what they have to do to face the challenges in  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the project partners of this project are fully\r\n\r\ncommitted  to achieving the objectives of the programmes  and\r\n\r\nclear  lines of accountability have been established  between\r\n\r\nthe  Facilitation Committee and the project partners that  we\r\n\r\nare  working  with.  Also co-funding by the project  partners\r\n\r\nwill   enhance  accountability.   Therefore,  I   am   rather\r\n\r\nreluctant  at the moment to create new organisations  or  new\r\n\r\nstructures  which,  I  feel,  would  add  another  layer   of\r\n\r\nbureaucracy.  What is needed, really, is effective management\r\n\r\nin  the  implementation of the programmes and this, we  feel,\r\n\r\ncould  be  achieved by having a committee which  is  directly\r\n\r\nresponsible   to  me,  with  enough  resources   to   attract\r\n\r\nparticipation  from  the community.   Nevertheless,  we  will\r\n\r\nmonitor the situation to see whether restructuring is  really\r\n\r\nnecessary,  because  restructuring of  the  whole  organising\r\n\r\ncapability  of the community is a big job in itself.   We  do\r\n\r\nnot want to be distracted in our pursuit of trying to prepare\r\n\r\nthe community\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  the  KBE,  and  instead  concentrate  our  resources  on\r\n\r\nrestructuring the community's organisational structure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung asked about volunteers and corporate\r\n\r\nresponsibility.   He has highlighted the need  for  the  more\r\n\r\nable  in society to help the less able, and for the corporate\r\n\r\nsector   to   engage  in  community  involvement,   and   for\r\n\r\nvolunteerism  to  strengthen these social bonds.   We  cannot\r\n\r\nagree more with this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, my Ministry, together with the National\r\n\r\nVolunteers  Centre (NVC) and the National Council  of  Social\r\n\r\nService (NCSS), is actively encouraging community involvement\r\n\r\nin volunteerism, from the young to even the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NVC, which was set up in July last year, promotes\r\n\r\nvolunteerism as a way of life, to all levels of society.  The\r\n\r\nresponse, I must say, has been most encouraging.  Some  3,000\r\n\r\nindividuals  have  signed  up for volunteering  opportunities\r\n\r\nthrough  the NVC's website, while some 60 organisations  have\r\n\r\nin fact expressed interest in doing community work.  NVC also\r\n\r\nadministers an annual grant of some $600,000 to provide  seed\r\n\r\ncapital  for  new  volunteer initiatives.  It  also  provides\r\n\r\ntraining   and   research,  and  work  with  volunteer   host\r\n\r\norganisations to develop good volunteer management practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to companies, many companies and public\r\n\r\nsector  organisations are, in fact, already giving donations.\r\n\r\nThey  help raise funds, and involve staff in volunteer  work.\r\n\r\nBoth  NVC  and  NCSS work closely with companies  to  set  up\r\n\r\nCommunity  Involvement Programmes for their staff and,  since\r\n\r\nJuly  1999,  the NCSS has signed up about 110 companies  from\r\n\r\nboth the private and public sectors in the programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Chest Awards are presented to outstanding\r\n\r\ncorporate   donors  and  fund-raisers  to   recognise   their\r\n\r\ncontributions.  The NCSS-organised \"Tribute to Volunteers\" is\r\n\r\nyet  another  occasion to acknowledge outstanding  individual\r\n\r\nand corporate volunteers, and a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnew  category of awards will be introduced in September  this\r\n\r\nyear, in conjunction with the President's Challenge for 2001,\r\n\r\nto  recognise  outstanding individuals and  corporations  for\r\n\r\ntheir  contributions to the social service sector.  This,  we\r\n\r\nhope,   would   further  incentivise  people   to   go   into\r\n\r\nvolunteerism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector is yet another key partner that can\r\n\r\nmobilise many people to do their part for the community.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  working with the PS21 Committee on Staff  Well-Being  to  launch  a  movement called the \"Public  Sector  in\r\n\r\nAction for the Community\" (PSAC) in April this year.  It will\r\n\r\nhighlight what public service organisations are doing for the\r\n\r\ncommunity and encourage even greater involvement by them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading organisations have, in fact, deliberate policies\r\n\r\nto encourage their staff to volunteer, eg, Keppel Corporation\r\n\r\nand  DBS  Bank grant their employees two days off a year  for\r\n\r\nvolunteer  work,  and  the staff of Jurong  Town  Corporation\r\n\r\nspend  Friday mornings helping out at the Spastic  Children's\r\n\r\nAssociation.   My  Ministry, NCSS and NVC  see  our  role  as\r\n\r\npromoting, sharing and recognising such practices, but it  is\r\n\r\nreally  for the employer to decide how to encourage staff  in\r\n\r\ntheir  volunteer efforts.  But, certainly,  we  will  try  to\r\n\r\nmotivate  them  and enthuse them into getting more  of  their\r\n\r\nstaff  to get into volunteer work and, I think, the trend  is\r\n\r\nmoving upwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year is the International Year of Volunteers. I\r\n\r\nhope many more companies will seize this opportunity to bring\r\n\r\nout the volunteers in their people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the Senior Parliamentary Secretary  for  their\r\n\r\nresponses  to  the  Members, and beg leave  to  withdraw  the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2).

Mr\r\n\r\nAbdullah Tarmugi.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about\r\n\r\nBefore-and-After-School-Care.  By the way,  Before-and-After-School-Care has now been renamed Student Care Centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SCCs provide a useful service in the care of\r\n\r\nchildren.  However, current overall demand is still  low  for\r\n\r\nthese  student care centres.  For example, a survey conducted\r\n\r\nby  the Ministry in 1998 shows that only about 3% of children\r\n\r\nbetween seven and 14 years old need student care services, as\r\n\r\nmost parents have alternative care arrangements at home, with\r\n\r\nrelatives  or foster families.  The number may have  gone  up\r\n\r\nsince, but we do not think it would have increased much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our data for the 136 student care centres operated by\r\n\r\nnon-profit organisations show an average enrolment rate of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout 70%.  There are another 70 student care centres run  by\r\n\r\ncommercial  operators, but I do not have the  information  on\r\n\r\ntheir enrolment, as we do not license these centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when planning for the SCCs, we work closely with\r\n\r\nnon-profit   organisations,  schools  and  local   grassroots\r\n\r\nadvisers,  to assess the demand and to site them at locations\r\n\r\nwhere  both usage and demand are highest.  For the  next  3-5\r\n\r\nyears, our projection is for 20 SCCs to be set up each  year.\r\n\r\nTwenty  new centres will indeed be set up by the end of  this\r\n\r\nyear.  Sengkang, a new estate with one centre currently, will\r\n\r\nhave  six  new  ones  over the next two years,  and  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to monitor the demand closely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instead of having a general subsidy for all, as in\r\n\r\nchildcare, our preference is for the subsidies for  the  SCCs\r\n\r\nto be targeted at low-income families.  For children enrolled\r\n\r\nin  centres  operated  by non-profit organisations,  the  fee\r\n\r\nassistance  is  up  to  75%, which is  extended  to  families\r\n\r\nearning  below  $2,500  per  month.   Anyway,  we  are  still\r\n\r\nmonitoring  the  situation and will try to improve  the  help\r\n\r\nthat we can give to such families and centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\nreply, and beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3).

We regularly collect accolades  for  our\r\n\r\nachievements  in  education, and economic and infrastructural\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  It is therefore timely to review our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsports  facilities, to ensure that they keep abreast  of  the\r\n\r\nlatest, if we hope to produce world-class sports talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the apex of our sports infrastructure is the National\r\n\r\nStadium, which is, by now, a rather middle-aged facility.   I\r\n\r\nwas therefore delighted to hear the Minister inform the House\r\n\r\nthat a new stadium would be built.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without doubt, it will require a substantial investment\r\n\r\nto build a stadium of international standards.  Therefore, it\r\n\r\nis crucial that we do not develop a facility that buzzes only\r\n\r\nonce  a  year,  on  National Day, or  during  the  occasional\r\n\r\nfootball  match.  We should have an integrated stadium,  with\r\n\r\nsufficient   commercial  facilities  and  at   a   convenient\r\n\r\nlocation, to ensure high usage and pedestrian traffic, making\r\n\r\nit therefore a viable enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, we aspire to be a sporting nation,\r\n\r\nwhere  sports excellence will strengthen national pride.   We\r\n\r\nhope  to  be  a  society where sports binds our  multi-racial\r\n\r\ncommunity.   We  want  to encourage our  people  to  exercise\r\n\r\nregularly and enjoy sports for a healthy lifestyle.  And,  if\r\n\r\nwe  can  increase the size of our sports industry, that  will\r\n\r\ncreate and add value to the country, offering many new career\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve all these ideals, we will need not just a new\r\n\r\nbuilding for the National Stadium, but a whole new sports and\r\n\r\nrecreation  complex,  which will be a  focal  point  for  all\r\n\r\nthings  related  to sports and healthy recreation.   The  new\r\n\r\nsports  complex  must have transportation  convenience,  with\r\n\r\neasy  access from a nearby MRT or light rail station, to  cut\r\n\r\ndown  traffic build-up and car park congestion.  To encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to be a sporting nation, our new sports  complex\r\n\r\nshould be one of the best in this region, comparable to  some\r\n\r\nof  the best in the world.  After all, we are now a developed\r\n\r\nnation, a First World economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be commercially viable, the new sports complex must\r\n\r\nhave sufficient commercial abilities to ensure viability\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  that  it  will  not  be a dead  town  in  between  major\r\n\r\ncompetitions.  It should be located where people could go  to\r\n\r\non  an  average evening in a normal day, for workouts,  games\r\n\r\nand recreation, and therefore it should not be tucked away in\r\n\r\nsome outlying location with difficult access.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote an example of such a sporting\r\n\r\ncomplex  that  has  been  built in  Wales,  at  Cardiff,  the\r\n\r\nMillennium Stadium, right inside the city.  This new  stadium\r\n\r\nwas  rebuilt with a seating capacity of 72,500, with  a  roof\r\n\r\nthat  can  be  fully opened and closed within 20 minutes,  to\r\n\r\nenable events of all kinds to be held under all weather.  The\r\n\r\nonly  other stadium with a retractable roof in Europe is  the\r\n\r\nAmsterdam Arena, which has a capacity of 50,000.  The stadium\r\n\r\nhas  an  adjoining retail, leisure and pleasure  development,\r\n\r\nincluding  shops, restaurants, pubs and hotels.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nfull   year-round  programme  of  international   and   local\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote arts, we are spending a sum of $594.8 million\r\n\r\nfor the building of the Esplanade Concert Hall, which will be\r\n\r\ncompleted next year.  For the promotion of sports, we  should\r\n\r\nspend  no  less for a first-class all-weather sports  stadium\r\n\r\nwhich  would  be  the  centrepiece in  our  efforts  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  sports  hub.  This sports  hub  would  help  to\r\n\r\nincrease  our  capabilities  in  sports  science  and  sports\r\n\r\nmedicine.  May I have the Minister's views on this?\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I cannot but agree more with\r\n\r\nthe MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh and the MP for Pasir Ris that our\r\n\r\nNational Stadium is outdated and should be redeveloped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I mentioned the need to develop a sports industry\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  To do this and to attract world-class sporting\r\n\r\nevents in Singapore, we need world-class venues to host these\r\n\r\nevents.  Our intention is to go\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeyond simply redeveloping the National Stadium. Instead,  we\r\n\r\nhave planned to build an integrated multi-purpose sports hub,\r\n\r\nwith entertainment, convention, commercial and other revenue-generating  facilities. It is important that the place  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  a viable one.  As Dr Ho has aptly pointed  out,\r\n\r\nthis  is  increasingly  the trend  world-wide  and  this  new\r\n\r\nconcept  will  help ensure that the sports hub is  viable  by\r\n\r\nkeeping the place active all the time outside of match  days.\r\n\r\nHe  also  mentioned the stadium would have to be conveniently\r\n\r\nlocated  so  that  people can go to the place  easily,  which\r\n\r\nmeans  you  need  to have good communications  and  transport\r\n\r\nfacilities.  This certainly will have to be  looked into.  We\r\n\r\nwill  do  a detailed feasibility study to ascertain what  the\r\n\r\ncommercially viable model for the sports hub would be.   This\r\n\r\nwould  include  ascertaining where the sports hub  should  be\r\n\r\nlocated, what sort of activities should be included, and  how\r\n\r\nit  should be run.  If need be, we will go to other countries\r\n\r\nto see what their experiences are with such facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (6), Mr Ibrahim Othman.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code JJ 3100.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS is managing many wakaf properties.

At the same time, I also wish to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether MUIS has decided on the number of mosques to be built\r\n\r\nunder  Phase  IV.   Apart from the number of  mosques  to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt, where will the locations of these mosques be?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Ibrahim Othman has asked about\r\n\r\nthe  mosque  development programme.  I would like  to  report\r\n\r\nthat  there  are six mosques under Phase III  of  the  Mosque\r\n\r\nBuilding  Programme  under MUIS.  The  first  mosque,  Masjid\r\n\r\nKhair  at  Choa  Chu  Kang  was completed  in  1997.   Masjid\r\n\r\nIstiqamah at Serangoon and Masjid Istiqhfar at Pasir Ris were\r\n\r\ncompleted  in  1999.  MUIS is now building three  mosques  in\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang,  Sembawang and Bishan.  The mosque  in  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  will  be scheduled to be completed  in  2002,  while\r\n\r\nthose  in  Sembawang  and  Bishan  will  be  expected  to  be\r\n\r\ncompleted in 2003.       MUIS has started planning for  Phase\r\n\r\nIV  of  the Mosque Building Programme and it will submit  its\r\n\r\nproposal to the Government soon before it is being announced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to corporatisation, Mr Ibrahim Othman has\r\n\r\nalso  asked about MUIS' plans on corporatisation.  Under  the\r\n\r\nAdministration  of  Muslim  Law  Act,  MUIS  undertakes   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment, maintenance and management of mosque  and  wakaf\r\n\r\nproperties,   amongst   other   functions.    Such   property\r\n\r\ndevelopment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand management functions are more efficiently and effectively\r\n\r\ncarried out, we think, on a commercial basis.  Hence, MUIS is\r\n\r\nnow   embarking  on  the  corporatisation  of  its   property\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and management activities.  This is expected  to\r\n\r\ntake place sometime in July this year.  MUIS will continue to\r\n\r\nbe  responsible for policy and regulatory matters in  respect\r\n\r\nof  mosques and wakaf properties. With the corporatisation of\r\n\r\nthe property department, MUIS, we feel, could better focus on\r\n\r\nits  core  functions  of  legal,  administrative  and  social\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and,  at  the  same  time,  develop  the   wakaf\r\n\r\nproperties more efficiently and effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for\r\n\r\nhis explanation and beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (7), Mr Charles Chong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code JM 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are children with varying forms of\r\n\r\ndisabilities and handicaps.  Some of these disabilities, such\r\n\r\nas  physical,  sight  and hearing impairment  can  easily  be\r\n\r\nidentified.    However,  there  are  dysfunctions   such   as\r\n\r\nattention  deficiency, mild intellectual and  other  learning\r\n\r\ndisabilities that may not be so easily diagnosed.   How  many\r\n\r\nof  our  children suffer from such disabilities?  We may  not\r\n\r\nknow  for certain as I am not aware of any population  survey\r\n\r\ndone to ascertain this figure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we do know that such children have special\r\n\r\nneeds.   Many  will  be  capable  of  achieving  their   full\r\n\r\npotential  with early diagnosis and professional help.   Some\r\n\r\nwould need special facilities with specialist teachers.  Some\r\n\r\ncan  be  integrated into the mainstream schools, while others\r\n\r\nmay benefit from a combination of both special and mainstream\r\n\r\nschools. Are we doing enough for this group of children?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that there is currently a two-year waiting\r\n\r\nlist  for  admission into some special schools.

Outside the hospital system, children with disabilities\r\n\r\nare  referred  to  organisations that  can  best  meet  their\r\n\r\nspecial needs, for example, autistic children are referred to\r\n\r\nthe Autistic Association of Singapore. These are associations\r\n\r\nwhich  have  the  expertise and the people are  committed  to\r\n\r\nworking with these kids.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, there are six VWOs and three special schools\r\n\r\nthat  have  set up what we call EIPIC, or Early  Intervention\r\n\r\nProgramme for Infants and Children below five years old  with\r\n\r\nvarious   disabilities.
