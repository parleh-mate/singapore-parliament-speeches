Legislation has already been  passed  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  which empowers  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nclose  down insurance companies which conduct  their\r\n\r\nbusiness in an improper way. Further legislation  is\r\n\r\nin hand to empower the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment to wind up these companies and distribute\r\n\r\ntheir  assets  to  policyholders. I understand  that\r\n\r\nsuch  legislation will shortly be introduced in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Parliament on a Certificate of  Urgency.\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore  Government intends to  take  similar\r\n\r\naction here, combining the two pieces of legislation\r\n\r\ninto   one.  I  have  been  assured  that   in   the\r\n\r\ndistribution  of the assests of these  companies  to\r\n\r\npolicy-holders,  there  will  be  no  discrimination\r\n\r\nbetween policy-holders in Singapore and those in the\r\n\r\nFederation  whether the company is  incorporated  in\r\n\r\none  territory or the other. I am informed, however,\r\n\r\nthat the mismanagement of several of these companies\r\n\r\nhas  been  so  bad that it is unlikely that  policy-holders  will get more than a portion of  the  money\r\n\r\nthey  have  put  in. Fortunately, however,  most  of\r\n\r\nthese   companies   have  only  recently   commenced\r\n\r\nbusiness  before  the  Federation  Government   took\r\n\r\naction to deal with them. The probable loss of money\r\n\r\nwhich  policy-holders may suffer has therefore  been\r\n\r\nlimited by the prompt action taken by the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  These  insurance  com  panics   receive\r\n\r\npayments of small sums of money, usually between  $3\r\n\r\nand  $12  per month per policy-holder. A $3  monthly\r\n\r\ncontribution  would entitle the policy-holder  to  a\r\n\r\nsum of $400 on death or in ten years' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since most of the companies were incorporated in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, the initiative in taking action  to\r\n\r\nwind  up  these companies rests with the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. As I mentioned before, policy-holders in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  be  treated on the  same  basis  as\r\n\r\npolicy-holders in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the near future, the two Governments intend to\r\n\r\nintroduce  full  and comprehensive legislation  over\r\n\r\nthe insurance business and there will be appointed a\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Insurance which will take charge  of\r\n\r\na  pan-Malayan department with authority to  enforce\r\n\r\nthe  law  in  both territories. The present  set  of\r\n\r\ninsurance   laws  which  the  two  Governments   are\r\n\r\nproposing  is only the first step in the control  of\r\n\r\nthe  insurance business. It is intended specifically\r\n\r\nto combat the mushroom insurance companies which had\r\n\r\nbeen springing up in recent months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I an very glad to know  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance has declared to this  I  louse\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  near  future the Government  will  be\r\n\r\nintroducing  legislation  to  protect  the   policy-holders.

Of course, when the  Ordinance  is\r\n\r\npassed  here, we can un a sep further  and  wind  up\r\n\r\nthese   companies  and  distribute  whatever  assets\r\n\r\nremain to policy-holders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

The reason is\r\n\r\nthat  they do not conduct insurance business in  the\r\n\r\nproper  actuarial  way.

We,  the  Government,  have  constantly\r\n\r\ngiven  our  wholehearted support to their  struggle.\r\n\r\nWe  view with grave concern the events taking  place\r\n\r\nin  the  neighbouring country of Indonesia.  We  are\r\n\r\nfully  conscious  of the fact that  developments  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  have  repercussions or reactions  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry.

This  good\r\n\r\nrelationship already  existed, more particularly  so  during  the\r\n\r\ntime of the present Government. He also charged that\r\n\r\nthe Government had intimidated the people who put up\r\n\r\nplacards  or  posters in support of  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nstruggle   against  Dutch  colonialism.   But,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  in addition to what has already been  said\r\n\r\nby  my  colleague, the Member for Ulu Pandan,  about\r\n\r\nthe work of putting up posters late at night, it  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  fact that they were put up in great numbers\r\n\r\nbearing the symbol of the Barisan Sosialis. So  they\r\n\r\nwere putting up these posters in order to make known\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our stand wholeheartedly in support of the struggle of the Indonesian people is not false. It is\r\n\r\npositive. We support the struggle  in all  consciousness.\r\n\r\nWe  have  no  ulterior  motive. However, what we are surprised at,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker,  are the  tactics and the attitude of the mover  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion.  His  attitude, like  the  proverbial  Malay\r\n\r\nsaying, is just like a cock crowing. This means that\r\n\r\npeople  who  only  talk and find fault  merely  make\r\n\r\nempty  noises,  and they fail to realise  their  own\r\n\r\nmistakes. Mr Speaker, this attitude of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis astounds us. When we ridicule them,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  direct it at Indonesia. We direct our  ridicule\r\n\r\nor insult at the Members of the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let us recollect some of the past events and of the people who live in the Malay Archipelago,\r\n\r\nor Temasek. Temasek is an old name  for Singapore. It has been \r\n\r\nwilled by God that people who are sincere and honest should have\r\n\r\nbeen oppressed by the  Western colonialists who, because of\r\n\r\ntheir lust and  greed,  succeeded in dividing the  people.  The\r\n\r\nWestern colonialists shared the spoils of the  Malay\r\n\r\nArchipelago amongst the Dutch, the British  and  the\r\n\r\nAmericans.  Thus the Malay Archipelago  was  divided\r\n\r\ninto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthree spheres until the end of the Second World War.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  God has also willed that  the  people\r\n\r\nshould  rise  in order to free themselves  from  the\r\n\r\nyoke of colonialism. The Indonesian people woke  up.\r\n\r\nThey  declared their independence in  spite  of  the\r\n\r\nsacrifices  which they had to make to achieve  their\r\n\r\nindependence.  Finally,  the  independence  of   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  people  was  recognised  by  the  world,\r\n\r\nincluding  the Dutch. It was, however, decided  that\r\n\r\nthe problem of West Irian should be resolved through\r\n\r\nnegotiations.    American   colonialism    in    the\r\n\r\nPhilippines was uneasy. Finally, the Americans  also\r\n\r\ngave  independence  to the Filipinos.  But  American\r\n\r\ncolonialism preferred to make an orderly retreat  to\r\n\r\nbeing   forced   to   retreat.   Likewise,   British\r\n\r\ncolonialism   had  no  alternative   but   to   give\r\n\r\nindependence to the Malayan nationalists.  They  did\r\n\r\nit  before  they  were ejected  forcibly.  For  that\r\n\r\nreason,  Mr Speaker, it is our duty, as one  nation\r\n\r\nin  the  Malay  Archipelago, to  be  united  in  our\r\n\r\nefforts   to   wipe  out  colonialism.   Since   the\r\n\r\nPhilippines  has thrown away the yoke of colonialism\r\n\r\nand  the  Indonesian people have  broken  away  from\r\n\r\ncolonialism,  we  will  not only  wipe  out  British\r\n\r\ncolonialism  here but will also wipe out colonialism\r\n\r\nin the Borneo territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the era of colonialism in Asia will definitely end. British colonialism is on its way out.\r\n\r\nThe  Dutch colonialists are adopting a  stone-headed attitude. \r\n\r\nThey forget Asian nationalism. They are  stubborn in wanting to \r\n\r\nhold on to  West  Irian. For  that  reason, Mr Speaker, we  give them  this\r\n\r\nwarning. Although the cow is a weak animal,  we  get\r\n\r\nmilk  from  it.  It  is  also used  to  pull  carts.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may not have horns, one day it will rise\r\n\r\nand use all its energies to free itself. This is the\r\n\r\nspirit  and the determination of the people  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay Archipelago in South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the people of Malaya, especially in Malacca, were under the rule of the Dutch. I still remember, when\r\n\r\nI  was in school,  a  history  book entitled \"Hikayat Abdullah\".\r\n\r\nIt was related in  this book how tyrannical the Dutch were \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntowards  her  subject people. The Dutch colonialists\r\n\r\nwill pay heavily for this tyrannical attitude. Their\r\n\r\ninhuman  action  took  the  form  of  torturing  and\r\n\r\nburying  people alive. Some were tied and beaten  to\r\n\r\ndeath.  Some  were hung to death.  There  were  many\r\n\r\nother  inhuman  atrocities committed by  the  Dutch.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an  excerpt  from  history  to  show   the\r\n\r\natrocities  of  Dutch  colonialism,  especially   in\r\n\r\nMalacca.  The  same  atrocities  were  committed  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia. For instance, the name of Westerling will\r\n\r\nremain  in  our memory, for he killed  thousands  of\r\n\r\ninnocent people in the Island of Celebes. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhen  we talk about colonialism in whatever form  it\r\n\r\nis,  what  is  fresh in our mind are the  atrocities\r\n\r\nwhich  the  colonialists committed on their  subject\r\n\r\npeoples.  For  this reason, if there  are  among  us\r\n\r\nthose  who are satisfied or who are complacent  with\r\n\r\nthe  power given to us by the colonial powers,  they\r\n\r\nare  only  the puppets of the colonial  power.  Only\r\n\r\nstooges  are prepared to tolerate such  a  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs.  This  clearly shows the attitude  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  when they moved  this  motion  of\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia. The Barisan Sosialis  opposed\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia. I think Mr  Speaker  himself\r\n\r\nknows the position as well as I do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we recollect, since the West Irian issue could not be resolved through negotiations at the conference\r\n\r\ntable, how the Dutch then  tried  to offer self-government to West \r\n\r\nIrian by changing  the name  of West Irian to Papua, and suggesting \r\n\r\na  flag for  Papua,  thereby  using  the  Papuans  as  their\r\n\r\nstooges or puppets to support their action. It would\r\n\r\nappear,  in  the words of the Minister for  Culture,\r\n\r\nthat if there were a Barisan Sosialis in West Irian,\r\n\r\nthey  would accept the Dutch plan, i.e., to  form  a\r\n\r\nself-government under the auspices of  the  colonial\r\n\r\nDutch.  This  is clear from their stand  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  complete self-government for  Singapore,\r\n\r\nrather  than  that Singapore should merge  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Is this the type of people who  wish  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the struggle of the Indonesian  people  for\r\n\r\nthe   return   of  West  Irian  to  the   Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment? Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   if  we  support  the  struggle   of   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian people, it is not because our support  is\r\n\r\nsuperfluous, or because we are anti-colonialists, or\r\n\r\nto gain publicity and make political capital out of\r\n\r\nthis  in order to get political support. People  who\r\n\r\nat  all times say, \"I love you,\" are not genuine  in\r\n\r\ntheir  love. It is false and has a sinister  motive.\r\n\r\nSuch  people make only empty promises. They  produce\r\n\r\nonly  noises,  but no results. In order  to  achieve\r\n\r\npeace and happiness, we say frankly and openly  that\r\n\r\nour  stand is that we love peace and justice. So  we\r\n\r\nwarn  the  Dutch to resolve this dispute peacefully,\r\n\r\nsurrender  West Irian to the Indonesian people,  and\r\n\r\nleave Irian Barat in an orderly manner. All this  is\r\n\r\nfor the sake of world peace and harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are wholeheartedly behind the people of\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  The  spirit  and  determination  of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  people are the same as ours. We  support\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly  and  we give  our  sympathy  to  the\r\n\r\nstruggle  of the Indonesian people. Our  support  is\r\n\r\nbehind  the  Indonesian people  who  were  once  the\r\n\r\nsubject  people of the Dutch, because we are against\r\n\r\ncolonialism  in any kind or form. This anti-colonial\r\n\r\nattitude  is embedded in our soul and in the  people\r\n\r\nof Asia. For that reason, Mr Speaker, we are making\r\n\r\nour  appeal in the interest of peace. If  we  hit  a\r\n\r\nsnake, we are going to make sure it is dead and that\r\n\r\nthe  stick  which we use to hit it is undamaged.  As\r\n\r\nlong as there is hope for negotiations, we must make\r\n\r\nuse  of  it. I also appeal to Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  to go back to the main road if  they  are\r\n\r\nlost  in  a cul-de-sac. I ask them not to  use  this\r\n\r\ninternational  issue to make political  capital  and\r\n\r\ngain  followers  in  the country  to  support  their\r\n\r\nParty.  We  realise  that our people  are  comprised\r\n\r\nmainly  of  anti-colonial people. But, as  has  been\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Member for Geylang Serai,  although\r\n\r\nthey  can see the germs across the sea, they cannot\r\n\r\nsee  the elephant in front of their nose. So I  wish\r\n\r\nto  appeal to the Barisan Sosialis not to dig  holes\r\n\r\nbecause they will be buried in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem. They should not always behave like a cock.  As\r\n\r\nI  have said just now, the cock crows, but there  is\r\n\r\nnothing in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I say that if we have been laughing at the motion which is being debated now, it is not because we wish to insult or show disrespect to the Indonesian people in their struggle. But what we are amused at are the tactics and behaviour of Members of the Barisan Sosialis when they speak on this motion. Once again, Mr Speaker, I wish to say that\r\n\r\nwe  wholeheartedly support the Indonesian people  in\r\n\r\ntheir  struggle to wrest West Irian from  the  Dutch\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  We  have  not  lost  hope  that  this\r\n\r\ndispute  may  be  settled peacefully.  This  is  our\r\n\r\nstand.   Once   again   I  deny  categorically   the\r\n\r\naccusation  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  that  we  are\r\n\r\ntreating this motion lightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nfully support the intention of the motion, but I  am\r\n\r\nnot  the same as the Barisan Sosialis who use filthy\r\n\r\nmud to thrown before the people's eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today I would only like to make a point on this motion. We have heard the Member for Thomson say that\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. has no sympathy with the Indonesian struggle to regain\r\n\r\nWest Irian, because  a number  of people have been detained for\r\n\r\nquestioning by the police for sticking up posters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I am surprised that the Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  should have repeated this allegation  after\r\n\r\nthe  correction  made  in the  Government  statement\r\n\r\nissued  on  13th January. I would like to  quote  to\r\n\r\nyou,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Straits Times  of  13th\r\n\r\nJanuary - this statement was issued by the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A Ministry of Culture statement today said the\r\n\r\nattempt  \"to  mislead the listeners\" could  only  be\r\n\r\ndeliberate,  as  the speakers well  knew  why  their\r\n\r\nfollowers had been detained for questioning  by  the\r\n\r\npolice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statement said that in pasting posters all\r\n\r\nover  the  place, including traffic  signs,  without\r\n\r\npermission  from  the appropriate  authority,  these\r\n\r\npeople  were  deliberately breaching regulations  in\r\n\r\nregard to the putting up of posters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Some of the Barisan Sosialis leaders, as former\r\n\r\nCity  Councillors  and Assemblymen,  know  of  these\r\n\r\nregulations.  The fact that these posters  were  put\r\n\r\nup... late at night is further evidence that  these\r\n\r\npeople knew that they were breaching regulations,...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations existed to ensure that no mischievous\r\n\r\nand  dangerous  posters were put up by irresponsible\r\n\r\npeople - such as racialists or Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were also necessary to ensure that there was\r\n\r\nno  unauthorised  defacement  of  public  places  by\r\n\r\nuncontrolled pasting of posters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting up posters without permission and under\r\n\r\ncover  of  darkness, the Barisan  Sosialis  prowlers\r\n\r\nquite  rightly invited the attention of  the  police\r\n\r\nwho  detained them for questioning and then released\r\n\r\nthem.\" the Government said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It pointed out that there seemed to he a growing\r\n\r\nimpression  on  the  part of  some  members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis that they Were a privileged  group\r\n\r\nto  whom the laws and regulations of the land should\r\n\r\nnot  apply and that any attempt to enforce obedience\r\n\r\nof these regulations constituted injustice.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis could have\r\n\r\ncomplied  with the simple regulations that a  permit\r\n\r\nshould  be obtained to put up posters. In any  case,\r\n\r\nthe  police  released those who put up  the  posters\r\n\r\nonce  the police were told that the posters were  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the Indonesian struggle to regain  West\r\n\r\nIrian. The police came suddenly upon people who were\r\n\r\nputting up posters in the middle of the night.  Some\r\n\r\nof  the  posters were in a language that the  police\r\n\r\ndid  not  understand. So they had  to  detain  these\r\n\r\npeople  for questioning. They had to make sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  posters  were not being put up  by  mischievous\r\n\r\npeople  for  mischievous ends. These  posters  could\r\n\r\nhave  incited people to violence or to racial hatred\r\n\r\npr  to  some other undesirable things. So was  there\r\n\r\nanything  wrong  in  the  police  detaining  unknown\r\n\r\npeople   for  questioning?  Once  the  police   were\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the posters were in support  of  West\r\n\r\nIrian,  they  let the bill-posters go,  even  though\r\n\r\nthey had breached the regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  let  me  ask the Barisan  Sosialis  and\r\n\r\nothers  not to break the law wilfully and, when  the\r\n\r\npolice  try  to  enforce the law, to  complain  that\r\n\r\nthere  is injustice and intimidation. Let them  also\r\n\r\nnot  use this as evidence that the Government is not\r\n\r\nsympathetic to Indonesia over the West Irian  issue.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. Government supported Indonesia over  the\r\n\r\nWest  Irian issue in a statement over two years ago.\r\n\r\nIt  has again declared its stand on the issue a  few\r\n\r\nweeks ago in a statement in support of Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the P.A.P. support this motion\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly, but we do so for different  reasons.\r\n\r\nThe  leader of the Barisan Sosialis at a mass  rally\r\n\r\non West Irian tried to draw suitable lessons for the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. For example,  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  said  that  the\r\n\r\nstruggle    in   West   Irian   showed   that    the\r\n\r\nconstitutional struggle was useless. We say that, as\r\n\r\nfar  as  Singapore is concerned,  that  is  not  the\r\n\r\nlesson.  We  have always said that  any  attempt  to\r\n\r\ncarry on the anti-colonial struggle by violence in a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial and multi-cultural society is to invite\r\n\r\ndisaster  for  the people. It is all  too  easy  for\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders to talk bravely of  revolutionary\r\n\r\nviolence and incite people to violence. But, Sir, it\r\n\r\nis  not the leaders who get hurt, injured or killed,\r\n\r\nbut  ordinary  people. The leader gives  orders  and\r\n\r\nmakes fierce speeches knowing full well that he will\r\n\r\nnot  get hurt or killed. I am not saying that  there\r\n\r\nmay  not be circumstances when force may have to  be\r\n\r\nused in defence of one's rights, but we say there is\r\n\r\nnothing  to  suggest that in the case  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nthere  is justification for using violence in  order\r\n\r\nto  get  independence for Singapore. The leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis have given no good reasons why\r\n\r\nwe should use violence in Singapore to get freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, to anyone who has any\r\n\r\nconscience  or realisation to want independence  and\r\n\r\nto  hate oppression, he would surely give support to\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian Government in order to get rid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof Dutch colonialism in West Irian.

This is   known  by  the  people  and \r\n\r\nalso  by  the   13 representatives of the Barisan Sosialis, and also \r\n\r\nby the  leaders of the Barisan Sosialis who  have  gone\r\n\r\nout  of  the P.A.P. In a fiery speech when he  moved\r\n\r\nthis motion, the leader of the Barisan Sosialis, the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown, said that this House supports\r\n\r\nthe  struggle of the Indonesian people to take  back\r\n\r\nWest  Irian from the Dutch. He said that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis had organised a mass rally in Geylang Serai\r\n\r\nand  that  more than 10,000 people were  present.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask them why they held  a  rally  at\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai. We know the reason why they have  not\r\n\r\ngot  the  support  of  the  Malays.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nintention  of holding a mass rally at Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\nwas   to   draw  the  Malays  there  and  take   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  influencing  them  to  support  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis. There is a Malay saying: while  we\r\n\r\ndive,  we drink. It is customary for the leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis to find opportunities and adopt\r\n\r\ntactics to confuse the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we still remember when we\r\n\r\ndiscussed  the  education policy the representatives\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis only talked about  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation  and they did not talk about the education\r\n\r\nof  others - not to mention Malay education.  In  this\r\n\r\nmotion  moved by the leader of the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Queenstown, we have the opportunity\r\n\r\nof studying the irresponsible tactics of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis to confuse the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Members of the Barisan Sosialis very often, talk very loudly in this Assembly that they have the support\r\n\r\nof the people, that the P.A.P. has no more the confidence of the \r\n\r\npeople, that it is no more supported by them, that it is better\r\n\r\nfor the P.A.P. to resign and hold general elections. I would\r\n\r\nlike   to  state  to  the  Members  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  who  are sitting on the Opposition,  that\r\n\r\nthey have not been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelected  on the Barisan Sosialis ticket but  on  the\r\n\r\nPetir   ticket.

The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  opposed  merger  but  suddenly  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  their  leaders  communicated  with   the\r\n\r\nBritish Government's representative in Singapore. Is\r\n\r\nthis  their  way to indicate their wish to  liberate\r\n\r\nthe  people  from British colonialism in  Singapore?\r\n\r\nThey  would  rather  the  British  rule  this  place\r\n\r\nlonger,  and  it  is possible that they  would  have\r\n\r\nguarantees for the future of their leaders  and  not\r\n\r\nof  the people. These are the tactics of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis in order to get the support of the  people.\r\n\r\nWe  can study their irresponsible tactics to confuse\r\n\r\nthe  people as a result of the motion moved  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Queens-town put up his hands at the rally at Geylang Serai and said, \"Let us get rid of\r\n\r\ncolonialism.\" I would like to ask him, since when had he \r\n\r\nstruggled against colonialism  and opposed  capitalists and \r\n\r\nimperialists, and how  many times has he gone to jail? He was\r\n\r\nonly known to  the\r\n\r\npeople when he joined the P.A.P.

It  seems\r\n\r\nto  me  also  that this is not the  time  for  fiery\r\n\r\nlanguage  but  for a cool head, a calm  mind  and  a\r\n\r\nsteady heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circumstances surrounding West Irian are not\r\n\r\nyet  unfavourable for a peaceful solution.

Under\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances, it does not seem proper that  we\r\n\r\nin  this  House should try to incite any  particular\r\n\r\nParty in the dispute to precipitate action. For what\r\n\r\nis at stake, Sir, is not merely a piece of territory\r\n\r\nbut the question of world peace or world war. We  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have been through a world  war  and  have\r\n\r\nsuffered the horrors of an enemy occupation. We know\r\n\r\nthat  when there is a world conflagration the people\r\n\r\nwho  suffer most are very often the innocent people.\r\n\r\nTherefore, before we incite the parties concerned to\r\n\r\nserious  military  action,  we  should  support  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of  the  Secretary-General  of  the  United\r\n\r\nNations   and  the  good  intentions  of   President\r\n\r\nSoekarno  to  keep  the door of peaceful  settlement\r\n\r\nopen  and  contribute our bit to finding a  solution\r\n\r\ntowards world peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of colonialism, we have said\r\n\r\nagain  and  again here in this House  that  all  the\r\n\r\nParties represented here are against colonialism. We\r\n\r\nknow that colonialism is an anachronism in this part\r\n\r\nof  the  world. It is no longer and should no longer\r\n\r\nbe   an  issue.  The  question  is,  how  soon   can\r\n\r\ncolonialism  be  removed from  South-East  Asia?  We\r\n\r\nbelieve that it can be made to retire gracefully, as\r\n\r\nthe  British are about to do. We are seeing it, Sir;\r\n\r\nwe  have  seen  it  in Malaya; we have  seen  it  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia; and there is no doubt that we shall see it\r\n\r\nin  the  case of West Irian, provided the people  do\r\n\r\nnot incite the participants concerned to unnecessary\r\n\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, we should not make anti-colonialism\r\n\r\na  platform  to discriminate between one  Party  and\r\n\r\nanother  Party.  It  seems  to  be  the  fashion  to\r\n\r\nindicate  that  one Party is more anti-colonialistic\r\n\r\nthan  another  Party, and the people  are  asked  to\r\n\r\njudge  the  degree of incitement or  firey  language\r\n\r\nbeing  used. I believe that it all depends on  their\r\n\r\nconvictions.  Today  we all agree  that  colonialism\r\n\r\nshould  be  removed. The question is  how  soon  and\r\n\r\nwhether  by violence or by peaceful means. It  seems\r\n\r\nwe  have come to the stage where the colonial powers\r\n\r\nknow  that if they can retreat gracefully, they  can\r\n\r\nsalvage something from the wreck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we therefore appeal to the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers  not to keep on drawing the line that  there\r\n\r\nare  Parties which are more against colonialism  and\r\n\r\nothers  which are less against colonialism,  because\r\n\r\nwe  are  all agreed on that issue.

For 400  years  the  European\r\n\r\npowers carved out the territories of Asia and Africa\r\n\r\nand  exploited  the natural and human  resources  of\r\n\r\ntheir  colonial  empires. No historian  of  economic\r\n\r\nhistory  has  attempted to deny that the  industrial\r\n\r\nrevolution of the countries of Europe was, in  large\r\n\r\nmeasure,  due  to  the  capital  accumulation   made\r\n\r\npossible  by  the large surpluses drawn  from  their\r\n\r\ncolonial  possessions. Even America,  a  country  at\r\n\r\npresent with the world's highest standard of living,\r\n\r\nowes  its  wealth to the tremendous human sacrifices\r\n\r\nwhich  the  negro  slaves, taken  out  from  Africa,\r\n\r\nlaboured  to  produce for the Americans of  European\r\n\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep and abiding hatred for the injustices and\r\n\r\niniquities  of  the colonial system aroused  by  the\r\n\r\ndomination  of the European peoples over the  Asians\r\n\r\nand  Africans became an irresistible force after the\r\n\r\nend  of  the  Second  World War.  Those  imperialist\r\n\r\npowers who have yielded and bent to the will of  the\r\n\r\nnationalists have fared better than those  who  have\r\n\r\nsought  to suppress and continue to subjugate  their\r\n\r\npeoples. Although the Portuguese looked like winning\r\n\r\nthe  first  prize  for obstinacy and  obtuseness  in\r\n\r\nrefusing  to  recognize that the  days  of  European\r\n\r\nempires in Africa and Asia are over, that is not  to\r\n\r\nsay that any Asian or African will easily forget the\r\n\r\nbrutalities of the French in Algeria or the Dutch in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to Indonesia in January 1960, I could\r\n\r\nwell  understand the ferocity and intensity  of  the\r\n\r\nhatred  of the Indonesians for the Dutch. The  Dutch\r\n\r\nhad  sucked  the wealthy Indonesia Archipelago  dry.\r\n\r\nThey  had  squeezed everything they could have  from\r\n\r\nthe  then Netherlands East Indies for the enrichment\r\n\r\nof the Dutch and their country in Europe. They had a\r\n\r\nhead tax or a capitation tax on all natives for  the\r\n\r\nprivilege  of  being alive, not for the  purpose  of\r\n\r\neducating  the  natives  but  for  the  purpose   of\r\n\r\nenriching the Dutch. The local population  was  kept\r\n\r\ndown to the position of serfs and slaves. A Javanese\r\n\r\nservant was so crushed and dispirited an animal that\r\n\r\nhe  crawled every time he passed the master  of  the\r\n\r\nhousehold. And no Javanese was good enough to be  an\r\n\r\nadministrator  in his own country.  The  postmaster,\r\n\r\nand  sometimes even the assistant postmaster, was  a\r\n\r\nDutchman.  And  so the end of Dutch rule  came  with\r\n\r\nmuch bitterness, hatred and vengeance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one day some Afro-Asian historian will\r\n\r\nwrite and  analyse history from the  purely  Afro-Asian  point of view and equate the skilful  running\r\n\r\nof  an  empire with the smooth and rapid dismantling\r\n\r\nof  it. Those countries which ran their empires  and\r\n\r\nsqueezed the riches of the colonies not to the point\r\n\r\nof  utter sterility were usually wise enough to know\r\n\r\nwhen it was time to make a graceful withdrawal. When\r\n\r\nthe  British left India and Pakistan in  1947,  they\r\n\r\nhad  moved  billions of crores of  rupees  worth  of\r\n\r\nwealth  from the soil of India created by the  sweat\r\n\r\nof  the  Indian people for over 300 years. But  they\r\n\r\ndid  leave  behind a coterie of well-trained  Indian\r\n\r\nadministrators in the Indian Civil Service,  trained\r\n\r\nand    able   Indian   judges,   teachers   in   the\r\n\r\nUniversities, and an incorrupt and disciplined army.\r\n\r\nTrue,  the army was made use of as cannon fodder  in\r\n\r\ntwo  world  wars, but at least there was a  coherent\r\n\r\nfighting force of nearly half a million men  with  a\r\n\r\ncore of able Indian officers from the subahdar-major\r\n\r\nto the major-general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the Dutch were pitch-forked out of\r\n\r\nIndonesia in 1949, they had ruined the country  even\r\n\r\nmore  than the Japanese had done during the 3\u00bd years\r\n\r\nof  Japanese  occupation. There were  no  Indonesian\r\n\r\nadministrators, no technicians\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand no apparatus to run the wherewithal  of  a\r\n\r\nmodern  State.  The bitterness and hatred  have  not\r\n\r\nworn off. I was not surprised to find, when I was in\r\n\r\nIndonesia in January 1960, that the deep and abiding\r\n\r\nhatred had eaten into the soul of the nation, partly\r\n\r\nby the selfish and greedy Dutch industrial combines,\r\n\r\npartly  by  the  arrogance and  superciliousness  of\r\n\r\nDutch  officials and the Dutch people towards  their\r\n\r\nformer  subjects; and last but not least,  by  their\r\n\r\nstupidity in clinging on to West Irian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as this motion seeks to give expression\r\n\r\nto  the  hatred that all subject peoples  must  feel\r\n\r\nstrongly  against  Western  imperialist  domination,\r\n\r\nparticularly   in  the  case  of  the   intransigent\r\n\r\nDutchmen, we give our solid wholehearted support. At\r\n\r\nthe end of my visit to Indonesia in January 1960,  I\r\n\r\nsigned a declaration jointly with the First Minister\r\n\r\nof  the  Republic  of Indonesia, Dr  Djuanda.  This\r\n\r\ndeclaration  included a statement  of  our  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards the West Irian issue. May I quote, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of Singapore fully supports the\r\n\r\nIndonesian struggle for the return of West Irian  to\r\n\r\nthe  territorial  jurisdiction of  the  Republic  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  The Singapore Government  expresses  the\r\n\r\nhope  that  the West Irian question will be  settled\r\n\r\npeacefully soon.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my quarrel with the Barisan Sosialis is that\r\n\r\ntheir intention in moving this motion is not to give\r\n\r\nexpression  to the solidarity of the former  subject\r\n\r\npeoples of Asia and Africa. Their whole object is to\r\n\r\nplay  party politics over a great national issue  of\r\n\r\nour  neighbour, to play Communist politics over  the\r\n\r\nstruggle of subject peoples seeking freedom.  Theirs\r\n\r\nis the cynical philosophy of utilising every current\r\n\r\npolitical movement, every strong political force, by\r\n\r\nassociating themselves with the high ideals  of  the\r\n\r\nstrong  nationalist movements and forces and  hoping\r\n\r\nthereby  insidiously to pervert these  movements  to\r\n\r\nthe Communist cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years since 1945 saw the expulsion of European\r\n\r\nempires from Asia. The years after 1957, when  Ghana\r\n\r\ngot  her  independence,  saw  the  European  nations\r\n\r\nkicked  out  of Africa. All this had nothing  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  Communism. It was the desire of men to be free\r\n\r\nand to be rid of domination by another race,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  desire  which  is as old as history  itself.  But\r\n\r\nlistening to the diatribes of the Communists through\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis, one might be led  to  believe\r\n\r\nthat   it   was  they  who  started  the  liberation\r\n\r\nmovements,  the movements for freedom of the  former\r\n\r\ncolonial   peoples   of  Asia   and   Africa.   They\r\n\r\nconveniently forgot the fact that it is  nationalism\r\n\r\nand  not  Communism which gave the driving force  to\r\n\r\nfreedom  movements throughout Asia  and  Africa.  To\r\n\r\nthem,  in  their cynicism, this desire  for  freedom\r\n\r\noffers  a magnificent opportunity to use and pervert\r\n\r\nit  for  their  own  objective  of  world  Communist\r\n\r\ndomination.  But  because they know  that  Communism\r\n\r\nwill not invoke enthusiasm in the subject countries\r\n\r\nof  Asia and Africa in the way that the desire to be\r\n\r\nfree  from  domination of colonialism has  done,  so\r\n\r\nthey   have  hidden  behind  the  slogan  of   anti-colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nationalist hates colonialism because he loves\r\n\r\nindependence. He wants his countrymen to be free and\r\n\r\nto  run  their  own  country. He is anti-colonialist\r\n\r\nbecause  he  loves  nationalism  and  freedom.   The\r\n\r\nCommunist  does not love nationalism or  freedom  in\r\n\r\nthe  sense  that the mass of nationalists throughout\r\n\r\nAfro-Asia   understand  it.  He  hates   colonialism\r\n\r\nbecause   he   wants  to  establish  the   Communist\r\n\r\nmillennium   which   he   believes   can   only   be\r\n\r\naccomplished by the dictatorship of the  proletariat\r\n\r\nled  by  the  cadres in the steel framework  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunist combat party. And because the mass of  the\r\n\r\npeople  are nationalists, not Communists,  he  hides\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  he is a Communist by talking  about\r\n\r\nanti-colonialism.  But unlike the  nationalist,  the\r\n\r\nCommunist does not end his anti-colonialism with the\r\n\r\nachievement  of independence. He cannot  afford  to,\r\n\r\nbecause  with  the  achievement of independence  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people who are nationalists want  to\r\n\r\nstart  building up their independent nation  into  a\r\n\r\nmodem  State  with all the sinews of  an  industrial\r\n\r\nsociety. The Communist anti-colonialist fears  this,\r\n\r\nand  rather  than  come out and say  that  he  is  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  and  therefore does not  believe  in  the\r\n\r\nnationalist  solution  in  trying  to  build  up   a\r\n\r\nnational State, he says the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanti-colonial  struggle is not  over.  He  keeps  on\r\n\r\nasking everybody to go on fighting authority in  the\r\n\r\nname  of  anti-colonialism, hoping that out  of  the\r\n\r\nanarchy and economic chaos that will result, he will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to assume power and establish a  Communist\r\n\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask the Member for Thomson, if not now in\r\n\r\nthis   House,  then  at  a  subsequent  time,  after\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  his  colleagues,  not  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  but possibly in the Opposition  Committee\r\n\r\nRoom, the following questions. After West Irian  has\r\n\r\nbeen  returned to Indonesia, will they say that  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian   people  have  completed   their   anti-colonialist  struggle? Are they  prepared  to  admit\r\n\r\nthat   the   Federation  of  Malaya  is   free   and\r\n\r\nindependent? Are they going to admit that the  anti-colonial  phase is over after independence and  that\r\n\r\nthe time has come to settle what kind of independent\r\n\r\ncountry  Malaya  should be? The Communists  are  now\r\n\r\nstill fighting in Malaya. In the same way after West\r\n\r\nIrian, the anti-colonial struggle for the Communists\r\n\r\nwill  have to go on and on and on, because  in  that\r\n\r\nway  they  hope to conceal their desire to carry  on\r\n\r\ntheir   struggle  for  Communism  by   using   anti-colonialism  as  the  camouflage  and  avoid   being\r\n\r\nisolated as Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is clear in the speech of the Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis when he spoke at a\r\n\r\nspecially  sponsored  mass  rally  of  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis at Geylang Serai. He was reported  to  have\r\n\r\nmade,   without  any  subsequent  denials,   several\r\n\r\nsignificant  statements.  First,  may  I  quote  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times of 8th January, page 4:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We realise that the moment is coming when we too\r\n\r\nwill  receive  the support and help of  other  peace\r\n\r\nloving people to free us from colonial domination.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, who are these peace loving people? Does he mean\r\n\r\nthe  U.S.A. and the Western imperialist  countries?\r\n\r\nSurely  not.  They,  are  war-mongering  imperialist\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  Does  he mean the decadent  bourgeois\r\n\r\nnationalists or neutralist States? Surely  not.  Can\r\n\r\nhe  mean  the  Russians and the Communist  blocs  of\r\n\r\npeace loving people whose intense and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassionate desire for peace led them to explode  the\r\n\r\n90  megaton  bomb?  And he went on  to  say  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Colonialism cannot be ended by any form of\r\n\r\nconstitutional imposition, and all should have their\r\n\r\neyes open who imagine that they can end all forms of\r\n\r\ncolonial exploitation of the Borneo people simply by\r\n\r\nhaving merger.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the Chinese report of this speech is even more\r\n\r\ninteresting. The Secretary-General spoke in  Chinese\r\n\r\nand  the  Sin  Chew Jit Poh on the  8th  of  January\r\n\r\nreports  him as differentiating between the  warlike\r\n\r\nWestern  countries, the neutral  countries  and  the\r\n\r\npeace  loving  countries. As there  are  only  three\r\n\r\npower blocs in the world, there can be little doubt,\r\n\r\nreading  the  Chinese Press, who are the  people  he\r\n\r\nrefers to when he talks of peace loving people. Sir,\r\n\r\nI  do  not want to have an unnecessary argument with\r\n\r\nMembers   of  the  Barisan  Sosialis   over   my   -interpretation of what is quoted here.

This is the philosophy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis, through the  Communist  open\r\n\r\nfront leader - Mr Lim Chin Siong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `Colonialism cannot depend on any\r\n\r\ncontrol  or  cannot  be ended by any  constitutional\r\n\r\nmeans.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is  a very important point. I did not want  to\r\n\r\nhave  this  misinterpreted by me.  As  I  heard  the\r\n\r\ninterpreter:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Colonialism cannot be ended by any constitutional\r\n\r\nmeans.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is the basic philosophy. And I did not know why\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Thomson was equivocating  when  we\r\n\r\nasked  him  what  he  meant by the  policy  of  open\r\n\r\nconfrontation  of force. But then  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson does not read the Chinese papers. So he  can\r\n\r\nperhaps  be excused of the fiercer line being  taken\r\n\r\nby  the  Secretary-General. Then he talks about  the\r\n\r\nstrength of progressive forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `The progressive forces, some\r\n\r\npeople are of the opinion that b) going through  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia plan they will be able to help the  Bornean\r\n\r\npeople to end all sorts of exploitation in any form.\r\n\r\nThis  incident should be able to serve  as  an  eye-opener. The people in these territories must  decide\r\n\r\nfor  themselves  and make their own  claims.  It  is\r\n\r\nuseless  to  go by constitutional means. The  people\r\n\r\nhave  been  given up to the pro-Western  people  and\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by them.

Let me give my version of  this.  There\r\n\r\nare  people who think that through Malaysia they can\r\n\r\nend all the various forms of colonial exploitation in  the  Borneo  territories,  and  this  happening,\r\n\r\nnamely,  in West Irian, should awaken them and  open\r\n\r\ntheir  eyes.  These things must be  settled  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  and their demands themselves. The  plan - this\r\n\r\nis  to  be  fair  to  the Secretary-General  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis - I would like to read again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `It is useless attempting to play\r\n\r\nwith constitutional means.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Prime Minister):</b> `For anybody with the intention\r\n\r\nto  play around with the constitution is a waste  of\r\n\r\ntime.

If  the leader of a country is pro-Western,\r\n\r\nin other words, he does not take the Moscow line or\r\n\r\nthe line of the Afro-Asian Conference in Bandoeng or\r\n\r\nin Cairo or in Belgrade, then he is pro-Western, and\r\n\r\nhanding over power to any group of men who are  pro-Western cannot bring freedom. That is a very strange\r\n\r\nproposition. Sir, I am not defending the  policy  or\r\n\r\nthe  approach of countries in Asia and Africa  which\r\n\r\nmaintain good relations with the West. Every country\r\n\r\nand  its  people have the right to choose their  own\r\n\r\nleaders who decide on their own policy.

But, of course, not U.M.N.O.'s Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya.  According to that thesis, espoused  and\r\n\r\nexplained  by  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  it  is   the\r\n\r\ncolonialist  stooge line. Therefore, freedom  is  an\r\n\r\nutter mockery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `We have nothing to be afraid of.\r\n\r\nAll   the  progressive  forces  in  the  world   are\r\n\r\nexpanding  and  this fact makes our  job  very  much\r\n\r\neasier.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Prime Minister):</b> `We have nothing to be afraid\r\n\r\nof.

With  your  kind  permission,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I was able to ask him where he thought\r\n\r\nI had lost it, and he said in the Colonial Office in\r\n\r\nLondon.  I have been wondering whether it  is  worth\r\n\r\nwhile  writing to the Colonial Office in  London  to\r\n\r\nfind  out  if  I had dropped anything there.  But  I\r\n\r\nrefrain  from doing such an irrational thing because\r\n\r\nI  came back from the Colonial Office in June  1958,\r\n\r\nand  at  that time the Member for Thomson was  quite\r\n\r\nhappy;  he was convinced that I had the right degree\r\n\r\nof  anti-colonial  fervour and he was  working  very\r\n\r\nhard  with  me  together  in  the  unions  competing\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Communist cadres  throughout  all  the\r\n\r\nyears  since  June 1958 to September  1960  when  he\r\n\r\ndecided to go over to the other side. Sir, can it be\r\n\r\nthat  after he has gone over, when he talks of anti-colonialism, he really means pro-Communism and  that\r\n\r\nmy honest brand of anti-colonialism, which means pro-nationalism, is no longer admired by him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thought he made a singularly unhappy\r\n\r\nspeech,  but then he had a singularly unhappy  task.\r\n\r\nHe  tried  to  show why the desire to liberate  West\r\n\r\nIrian  and to integrate it with Indonesia  is  anti-colonialism.  But  the desire to liberate  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  three Borneo territories and to  integrate\r\n\r\nthem with Malaya in a Federation of Malaysia is  not\r\n\r\nanti-colonialism.  Then he gave a  whole  series  of\r\n\r\nexcuses. Perhaps I should be fair to him. His Brains\r\n\r\nTrust closeted in the Opposition Committee Room have\r\n\r\nbrought  out a whole series of excuses  to  try  and\r\n\r\nshow why West Irian is different from Malaysia.  The\r\n\r\ncurious  thing about this Brain Trust is that  since\r\n\r\nthey  moved over from this side of the House in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee   Room  to  a  far-away  corner   in   the\r\n\r\nOpposition Committee Room -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I do not know if  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  they realise that they have got the plague,\r\n\r\nand,  in  decency and humanity, they  want  to  keep\r\n\r\ntheir  malady  to themselves. But the fact  is  that\r\n\r\npeople  like  Messrs.

But let  me  read  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson what his Secretary-General  has\r\n\r\nsaid in the Sin Chew Jit Poh. I will read this first\r\n\r\nin  English,  Sir, and then I will read the  Chinese\r\n\r\ntext:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The struggle of the Indonesian people against\r\n\r\ncolonialism  is not finished. The Dutch must  return\r\n\r\nto  Indonesia all the islands which once constituted\r\n\r\nthe former Dutch East Indies.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the basis of the Barisan Sosialis support\r\n\r\nfor West Irian. The Secretary-General of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis explained that West Irian belonged  to  the\r\n\r\nDutch  East  Indies, that Indonesia is the  rightful\r\n\r\nsuccessor  of  the Dutch East Indies, and  that  the\r\n\r\nwhole  empire  must be given up to  the  nationalist\r\n\r\nheir   and   successor,  namely,  the  Republic   of\r\n\r\nIndonesia;  and  he, Mr Lim Ching Siong,  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant open front Communist leader, has logically\r\n\r\ndenounced  that  all this talk of self-determination\r\n\r\nin  West Irian and the giving of self-government  to\r\n\r\nPapuans in West Irian is so much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprevarication  and  duplicity on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nwicked Dutch colonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have summarised it in one short\r\n\r\nparagraph - about  three paragraphs in  Chinese - and  I\r\n\r\nlay  it upon the Table for the interpreter to  spell\r\n\r\nit out in Hansard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the same way, we expect them to dismiss as\r\n\r\nutter rubbish any British talk of self-determination\r\n\r\nfor  a  few  hundred thousand people in  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.  As  far  as  I  can  see,   the   only\r\n\r\ndifference  is  that, unlike the  stubborn  and  the\r\n\r\nstupid   Dutch  who  insist  on  talking  of   self-determination  for  a few hundred thousand  Papuans,\r\n\r\nthe   British  are  sensible  enough  to  know   the\r\n\r\nabsurdity of making such excuses and are yielding to\r\n\r\nthe   logic  and  the  relentless  pressure  of  the\r\n\r\nnationalist solidarity for Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I cannot understand is how a troupe of\r\n\r\ndialectical jugglers can get themselves into such an\r\n\r\nabsurd position where they support the anti-colonial\r\n\r\nstruggle for the liberation of West Irian, and hence\r\n\r\ndenounce  the hypocrisy of the Dutch in  talking  of\r\n\r\nself-determination for the Papuans, and, at the same\r\n\r\ntime,  support the same anti-colonial nonsense about\r\n\r\nself-determination for a few hundred thousand people\r\n\r\nin  the Borneo territories when the whole desire  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Malaysia is to be free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson tried to explain this\r\n\r\nin  several  ways. He said that the British  support\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  that  the Dutch  oppose  West  Irian.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   one  is  pro-colonialist  because   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists  support it, and  the  other  is  anti-colonialist  because the colonialists oppose  it.  I\r\n\r\nasked  him, therefore, whether if the British oppose\r\n\r\nMalaysia he would support it, because then it  would\r\n\r\nbecome, by his reasoning, an anti-colonial issue. He\r\n\r\nwas  not able to give me a reply but he promised  me\r\n\r\none  when  the Malaysia debate comes on. Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nsorry  that  from  time to time I have  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Thomson  embarrassing  questions,   so\r\n\r\nembarrassing that he has absented himself from  this\r\n\r\nChamber. But it seems to me that whether an issue is\r\n\r\nanti-colonial  or not depends not upon  whether  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists stupidly oppose it, or wisely, in their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nown  self  interest, support it. A  stupid  colonial\r\n\r\npower   opposes  any  form  of  withdrawal  of   his\r\n\r\nimperialist position. Was the Member for Thomson  in\r\n\r\nhis right mind when he suggested that this should be\r\n\r\nthe  yardstick,  whether a nationalist  movement  is\r\n\r\nanti-colonial   or   not?  Did   he   suggest   that\r\n\r\nnationalism should be measured not by the desire  of\r\n\r\na   people  to  liberate  every  portion  of   their\r\n\r\nterritory  but  by  whether or not  the  imperialist\r\n\r\npower yields? And if it does, then it cannot be anti-colonialist, because the colonialists have  yielded.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  as a corollary, the Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  any plan supported by  the  British\r\n\r\nmust be pro-colonialists. So I asked him whether the\r\n\r\nplan  to integrate the three Borneo territories into\r\n\r\na  Federation  of Borneo is a colonialist  plan.  It\r\n\r\nmust  be because, according to him, a plan supported\r\n\r\nby  the  colonialists is colonial. He had difficulty\r\n\r\nin  answering  that question about the  West  Borneo\r\n\r\nFederation because it was the British who  sponsored\r\n\r\nthe  scheme and it has been reported to be supported\r\n\r\nby   one  of  the  few  non-Communist  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nParties   in  the  Borneo  territories   which   has\r\n\r\nrelations  with the Barisan Sosialis, namely,  Party\r\n\r\nRa'akyat   of  Brunei.  The  President  has   warmly\r\n\r\nsupported  this plan of the Borneo Federation  which\r\n\r\nis  a colonialist plan because the British sponsored\r\n\r\nand  supported  it. But was the Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\nsuggesting   that  Inche  Azahari   is   thereby   a\r\n\r\ncolonialist stooge for supporting a colonialist plan\r\n\r\nlong  after the colonialists have abandoned it? Sir,\r\n\r\nhe  then  said that West Irian is the  wish  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Indonesia including the people  of  West\r\n\r\nIrian.  Sir, how did he know this? Did he  not  know\r\n\r\nthat Malaysia is strongly supported by the people of\r\n\r\nour  five  territories?  After  he  went  at  public\r\n\r\nexpense to Borneo. We allowed him to go, but he  has\r\n\r\nnot  been to West Irian, although I have assured the\r\n\r\nHouse  the other day that if he volunteers  for  its\r\n\r\nliberation, although as a Government we will not  be\r\n\r\nable to pay for his passage, as a Party we will  pay\r\n\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> One-way ticket!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And if he believed that the\r\n\r\nclaim  is  supported  by the  West  Irianians,  then\r\n\r\nsurely  he was in fact advocating that there  should\r\n\r\nbe  acceptance  of the colonialist proposition  that\r\n\r\nthe  Papuans or West Irianians or West Irians should\r\n\r\ndecide   whether  or  not  they  should  come   into\r\n\r\nIndonesia. But then no nationalist in his right mind\r\n\r\nconcedes to such colonialist nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he went on to say that whether or not the\r\n\r\ndesire  to  complete  the  liberation  of  a  former\r\n\r\nempire,  a part of which is still under subjugation,\r\n\r\nis  anti-colonialism depends upon whether the people\r\n\r\nresisted it at the time of separation. He said  that\r\n\r\nthe Dutch were resisted by the Indonesians when they\r\n\r\nseparated West Irian. This is a strange thing  about\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis - whenever they deal with people\r\n\r\nwhom  they think they can eat up, they denounce  and\r\n\r\nabuse  them  in vicious terms, name them by  vicious\r\n\r\nand  vile  epithets. But when they deal with  people\r\n\r\nwhom  they feel they are an unequal match for,  they\r\n\r\nbegin  to  talk in innuendoes; they have  an  unholy\r\n\r\nfear of talking direct. As the people in high places\r\n\r\nsupported  the  separation  of  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nFederation and of the Borneo territories when Malaya\r\n\r\nwas  allowed  to become independent.  Sir,  does  he\r\n\r\nseriously  suggest that whether an  issue  is  anti-colonial  or otherwise depends upon whether  when  a\r\n\r\nportion   of  the  territory  is  allowed  to   gain\r\n\r\nindependence, people in high places protest  at  the\r\n\r\ncontinued   subjugation  of  other  parts   of   the\r\n\r\nterritory?  In  other  words, it  depends  upon  the\r\n\r\naccident of the actions of people in high places  at\r\n\r\nthe  time  of separation, and not upon the intrinsic\r\n\r\nqualities  of  an anti-colonialist situation.  I  am\r\n\r\nsurprised that the Member for Thomson, who  is  such\r\n\r\nan  avid  student  of  dialectical  materialism  and\r\n\r\nsocialist realism, should be led to propound such  a\r\n\r\nsubjective and not an objective theory, of sizing up\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not the movement is anti-colonial.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson said that it does not depend upon\r\n\r\nwhether  West  Irian is really a part of  Indonesia,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  quite  contrary to  what  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan Sosialis,  as  I  read  in\r\n\r\nChinese, said in Geylang Serai, but that it  depends\r\n\r\nupon whether President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoekarno  opposes it or whether the Tunku  does  not\r\n\r\noppose it.

But if he keeps on talking like\r\n\r\nthat,  I can assure him that he will fail the  first\r\n\r\nelementary  examination in dialectical  materialism.\r\n\r\nThen  he  said that West Irian is different  because\r\n\r\nthe  Dutch retained it by force. These were all  his\r\n\r\nwords.  They were reported in the Straits Times.  We\r\n\r\nheard  it  in  this  House.

The other one is Soekarno and this one is the\r\n\r\nTunku.  And anyway the Dutch retained West Irian  by\r\n\r\nforce,\" implying that if the Dutch did not retain it\r\n\r\nby  force  but by popular consent, then  it  is  all\r\n\r\nright,  it  is not anti-colonialism. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  he  realised the full implications  of  his\r\n\r\nproposition.  But  this  is  really  the  height  of\r\n\r\ndialectical  absurdity because, by implication,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson, the great anti-colonialist,  was\r\n\r\ngiving,  in  a  back-handed way, a  bouquet  to  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Raj, suggesting of course that the  British\r\n\r\nare   not   retaining  Singapore  and   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories by force but by the popular consent  and\r\n\r\nwill  of  the  people. Now are the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nanti-colonialist? When it suits them, they say, \"No,\r\n\r\nwe must have the colonial struggle to carry on. Then\r\n\r\nwe can use this slogan, hide ourselves together with\r\n\r\nthe nationalists, because the nationalists are anti-Communist  and  non-Communists  but  all  are  anti-colonialists.  Therefore, let us  all  get  together\r\n\r\nunder  a common denominator - anti-colonialism.\"  Then\r\n\r\nhe   reached   the  culmination  of  his  tremendous\r\n\r\nargument  against Malaysia. He said  that  what  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis wanted is the original Malaysia. He\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Melayu Raya, for merger of Singapore. Malaya\r\n\r\nand the Borneo territories into the Republic of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\" He left out the Philippines.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether it is because in his definition it  is\r\n\r\nnot included, but anyway he was quite happy to merge\r\n\r\nwith  the  Republic of Indonesia. Well, there  speak\r\n\r\nBintang  Timor and Harian Rakyat  - the voice  of  the\r\n\r\nP.K.I. (Parti Komunis Indonesia). And he quoted  all\r\n\r\nthis  without so much as saying with the  leave  and\r\n\r\nconsent of Bintang Timor and Harian Rakyat.  He  was\r\n\r\npropounding  this as a new and original  proposition\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis. Sir, I can understand this\r\n\r\nline  of  the  Bintang Timor and the  Communists  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  They want Malaysia as part of Indonesia.\r\n\r\nWhy?  They say that Malaysia as a separate State  is\r\n\r\nanti-Indonesia. That is what the Member for  Thomson\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Malaysia is anti-Indonesia.\"  And  why?  The\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson may or may not know; he has  made\r\n\r\nso  many  elementary mistakes in explaining away  in\r\n\r\ndialectical terms the political situation in  South-East   Asia.  Perhaps  he  may  not  know  that   an\r\n\r\nindependent and nationalist State of Malaysia  would\r\n\r\nbe  difficult  of  absorption by Indonesia  because,\r\n\r\nunlike   West  Irian,  they  would  have   to   meet\r\n\r\nnationalists and not colonialist forces. He  may  or\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  sincere when he says that he  wants  a\r\n\r\nmerger  of  Singapore  and the  territories  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation   and   Borneo  into  the   Republic   of\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  We  can  only assume  that  he  and  his\r\n\r\nSecretary-General are sincere. I read the Secretary-General just now praising in very glowing terms  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Republic of Indonesia, that he is a\r\n\r\ngreat man; and according to this picture of the mass\r\n\r\nrally, in the honoured place on the right-hand  side\r\n\r\nof  the  symbol  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis - the  Red\r\n\r\nStar - is a great portrait of President Soekarno.  And\r\n\r\nhe  said, \"Oh, this is the struggle of righteousness\r\n\r\nagainst  wickedness.\" The Barisan Sosialis  keep  on\r\n\r\ntelling us that they represent the people. I say  to\r\n\r\nthem  that if they keep on repeating that Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo  territories and Malaya should  go  into\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and merge with it and they  say  that  it\r\n\r\nrepresents the view of the people, they will wind up\r\n\r\nin  Woodbridge Hospital and not just as  members  of\r\n\r\nthe Advisory Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson made what he thought\r\n\r\nwas  a  scathing statement which would reduce me  to\r\n\r\nutter  ridicule.  He said that I spent  my  time  in\r\n\r\nKuching  playing golf all the time. Sir,  he  forgot\r\n\r\nthat  only  three weeks previously he  had  bitterly\r\n\r\ndenounced me when he returned from Borneo for having\r\n\r\nspent my time advising the Federation delegation  on\r\n\r\nhow  to  answer  the  difficult  questions  put   by\r\n\r\ndelegates from Sarawak and North Borneo and how,  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  my assistance, he referred to  me  as  an\r\n\r\nastute  personality  - I am deeply honoured;  a  back-handed  compliment from an ideological mortal enemy.\r\n\r\nOf  course, personally we are still good friends. He\r\n\r\nbuys me a drink -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> And you buy him two!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have not bought him two yet,\r\n\r\nSir,I  always put it on the account of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Nee  Soon who is the wealthiest of  us  all  in\r\n\r\nprivate practice and whose wealth is clearly visible\r\n\r\nnow.  However,  he  said that in  spite  of  all  my\r\n\r\nassistance,  there were so many difficult  questions\r\n\r\nthat  could  not be answered; he had to go  back  to\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur, adjourn the meeting there for further\r\n\r\ntime  to  consider  and  give satisfactory  answers.\r\n\r\nWhere   is   the   truth - two  utterly  contradictory\r\n\r\nstatements made at two different times? I  can  only\r\n\r\nassume that the Member for Thomson had forgotten the\r\n\r\nabsurdity of his first allegation when he  made  his\r\n\r\nsecond  allegation.  Perhaps he  has  forgotten  the\r\n\r\ntruth that, as a member of the Singapore delegation,\r\n\r\nI  worked  hard to put the Singapore point  of  view\r\n\r\nacross. And the day's work having been done, I  took\r\n\r\nthe opportunity of a bit of recreation to play golf,\r\n\r\nwhile  he bemused himself at the bar of the  Aurora.\r\n\r\nMind  you, Sir, the Aurora is the poshest  hotel  in\r\n\r\nKuching - all paid for by C.P.A.

As Speaker, I was just\r\n\r\ndebating  in my mind whether or not conduct  at  the\r\n\r\nbar  of  the Aurora is personal conduct. If  it  is,\r\n\r\nthen perhaps the Prime Minister should not refer to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat,  just as I told the Member for Thomson not  to\r\n\r\nrefer to golf playing in the first instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I would like to lay\r\n\r\nmyself  open to criticism of any conduct - whatever  I\r\n\r\ndo in public is public conduct, be it on my personal\r\n\r\nbehalf  or  on behalf of the public weal that  I  do\r\n\r\nthese things. However we will leave it at that.  All\r\n\r\nI  need say about golf, Sir, is that it is a pity he\r\n\r\ndid  not pursue the game because three years ago the\r\n\r\nMember  for Thomson and Dominic Puthucheary and  his\r\n\r\ngood friends went up to Fraser's Hill and tried  out\r\n\r\nmy clubs on the golf course there. Had he persisted,\r\n\r\nhe  might  have  understood the potential  political\r\n\r\nvalue of golf which has led to his undoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am glad the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas made that statement, because it seems to me that\r\n\r\nprobably modren golf is public conduct!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Certainly, Sir, and quite rightly, from time to time I anxiously watch the\r\n\r\ncomings  and goings on the golf course,  because  in\r\n\r\nthe free and lax atmosphere when one looks at vistas\r\n\r\non  the  wider  horizon, one is not worried  by  the\r\n\r\nhothouse atmosphere of synthetic revolution bred out\r\n\r\nof  anxiety and neurosis in a smoke-filled Committee\r\n\r\nRoom. In calm and detachment, forces are analysed to\r\n\r\ntheir  last and absolute fundamentals, and prognoses\r\n\r\nare  more  likely often made in quiet  and  peaceful\r\n\r\nsurroundings  than  in  synthetically  excited   and\r\n\r\nanxious ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all I need say before I close the subject of\r\n\r\ngolf  is that I have a clear encouragement from  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of the Barisan  Sosialis  that  I\r\n\r\nshould  play more golf. I met him on Friday  in  the\r\n\r\nC.P.A.  Room,  and  he inquired anxiously  after  my\r\n\r\nhealth.  He said he heard that I went and  addressed\r\n\r\nthe  University of Malaya students and  that  I  had\r\n\r\nblacked out. I said, \"Yes, I had.\" And he said, \"Ah,\r\n\r\nyou  worked too hard and the strain was too much for\r\n\r\nyou.\" I said, \"No, it was just one minute. It was an\r\n\r\nold complaint\". He said he know about it because - and\r\n\r\nthis  happened when he was in this Assembly - you will\r\n\r\nremember I once recounted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  problem  of  people who suffer  from  low-blood\r\n\r\npressure,  of which I am an unfortunate sufferer.  I\r\n\r\nwent  on  to assure him that even if I were to  pass\r\n\r\nout permanently, it would be unlikely that merger or\r\n\r\nMalaysia would be forgotten. And he ruefully agreed.\r\n\r\nHe   is   a   man   better  trained  in  dialectical\r\n\r\nmaterialism  and socialist realism than  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson. He understands that history is not made\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P. or  the Prime Minister.  There  are\r\n\r\nimportant movements and forces and peoples, and  one\r\n\r\nof  those  forces  and  peoples  is  nationalism  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  And  those  who  stand  in  the  way   of\r\n\r\nnationalism  and  want to throw  themselves  against\r\n\r\nthis  overwhelming  might may well  have  reason  to\r\n\r\ndespair  when  the relentless process and  logic  of\r\n\r\nforces  and events unfold in Malaysia. In any  case,\r\n\r\neverything is all right and I hastened to assure him\r\n\r\nwhat  he  had  already known many  years  ago,  that\r\n\r\npeople who suffer from low-blood pressure live  long\r\n\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson should remember that\r\n\r\nmost people do not change their basic beliefs as  he\r\n\r\nhas  done. He melted away at the thought of  a  long\r\n\r\nand  protracted struggle for supremacy  against  the\r\n\r\nCommunist cadres in the unions. He became tired  and\r\n\r\nin  his  exhaustion - he was in a  state  of  physical\r\n\r\nexhaustion  in September 1960 when he  asked  us  to\r\n\r\nsend him away to England on a T.U.C. course, to  run\r\n\r\naway  from it all for a while - he believed  that  the\r\n\r\nworld  would belong to the zealous Communists. Well,\r\n\r\nthat is his mistake and that is his business. But he\r\n\r\nmentioned  Ferhat Abbas and Lumumba and how  utterly\r\n\r\ndisgusted  he  was  that we were not  sincerely  and\r\n\r\navidly  in  favour of the great causes of peace  and\r\n\r\nanti-colonialism represented in these two men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first remind him - he knows all this - these\r\n\r\nare  things  which were uttered between us.  Let  me\r\n\r\nremind him first of Lumumba and what I said in  this\r\n\r\ndebate - the  thing  that made the  late  Mr  Lumumba\r\n\r\npolitically  important was that his  opponents  were\r\n\r\nstupid  enough to assassinate him. But for the  fact\r\n\r\nthat he died such a cruel death at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  hands of political opponents, he may well  have\r\n\r\ngone down as a comic figure in Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in those days - I think it was January last\r\n\r\nyear - we  were all still comrades in the P.A.P.,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Thomson and Mr Sandra Woodhull were\r\n\r\ndiscussing with me in the C.P.A. Room as to  why  we\r\n\r\nshould  not only move a resolution about Mr Lumumba\r\n\r\nbut  that  I  should name a road after Lumumba,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, Lumumba Highway. I told them then,  and  I\r\n\r\ntell them now that I am quite happy to call a circus\r\n\r\nafter  Lumumba,  if  the  next  roundabout  lacks  a\r\n\r\nsuitable  name, but I see no reason  why  we  should\r\n\r\ncommemorate the name of an anti-colonialist whom the\r\n\r\nRussians thought they could use as their stooge  but\r\n\r\nwho  lacked  basic  stability,  both  emotional  and\r\n\r\npolitical.  He  let  his people  down,  among  other\r\n\r\nthings, by using the resources of the Congo to  take\r\n\r\na  Belgian popsy with him to the United Nations,  so\r\n\r\ndescribed  in Time magazine, Sir, and in  unpleasant\r\n\r\ndetail -  \"the redhead daughter of a curio dealer\".  I\r\n\r\ntold  both  Mr Woodhull and the Member for  Thomson\r\n\r\nthat  that  was  not my idea of a great  nationalist\r\n\r\nleader.  Mr Woodhull said I should make allowances\r\n\r\nfor  the African ethos. And I had a sneaking feeling\r\n\r\nthat  perhaps Mr Woodhull was already  finding  his\r\n\r\nexcuses  for  the  day  when he  would  be  measured\r\n\r\nagainst  the  austere and puritannical standards  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese revolution. However, we will  let  that\r\n\r\npass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Ferhat Abbas, nobody in his right senses\r\n\r\nwould  doubt  the sincerity with which  we  welcomed\r\n\r\nhim.   Here  was  a  French  scholar,  the  Algerian\r\n\r\nnationalist,  the  moderate in an  extreme  Algerian\r\n\r\nsituation.  Now, unfortunately, by the  dictates  of\r\n\r\nthe  situation he has been replaced by  fiercer  and\r\n\r\nsterner  men.  We welcomed him and  his  people  for\r\n\r\ntheir  heroic  struggle against the stupidities  and\r\n\r\nthe  atrocities of the French. But just in case  the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson does not know it, let me tell him\r\n\r\nthat   the  F.L.N.,  which  formed  the  Provisional\r\n\r\nGovernment of Algeria, expels anybody who  is  found\r\n\r\nto be a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunist  or  have Communist connections.  And  the\r\n\r\nF.L.N. have   not  forgotten  that  the   Algerian\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party  opposed  the  revolt  against  the\r\n\r\nFrench when they started it in 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, Sir, even though a nationalist\r\n\r\nmovement does not lend itself as a stooge instrument\r\n\r\nof  the  Communists, objective circumstances  compel\r\n\r\nthe   Communists   to   support  it.   International\r\n\r\nCommunists,  in utter and complete cynicism  of  the\r\n\r\nfate of Communists both in Algeria and in Egypt, who\r\n\r\nare  smacked  down with considerable regularity  and\r\n\r\nruthlessness,  support both the Aswan  Dam  and  the\r\n\r\nF.L.N. So one does not have to be a pro-Communist in\r\n\r\norder  to be an anti-colonialist. That is the  first\r\n\r\nlesson    to    learn   in   objective   dialectical\r\n\r\nmaterialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of the Communists is simply this:\r\n\r\nunlike  the nationalists, they cannot afford to  say\r\n\r\nwhat  they  believe in. And so they start  on  false\r\n\r\npremises.  They say they believe in democracy  when,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  they believe in Communism. They say  they\r\n\r\nbelieve  in the freedom of the individual  when,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  they  believe  in  the  dictatorship  of  the\r\n\r\nproletariat.  We  have  the  advantage   of   saying\r\n\r\nhonestly and frankly what we believe in, and  to  do\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  stated  we  believed  in,  like  an\r\n\r\nindependent,  democratic,  non-Communist,  socialist\r\n\r\nMalaya,   not   an  independent,  democratic,   non-Communist, socialist Malaya in the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nbecause that is not what they believe in. We believe\r\n\r\nthat  West Irian belongs to Indonesia, so we support\r\n\r\nthis   motion.  In  the  same  way,  logically   and\r\n\r\nconsistently,  we  believe that  Malaya,  Singapore,\r\n\r\nNorth Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei belong to Malaysia,\r\n\r\nand  we are not afraid of supporting history.  Since\r\n\r\nthere  are  people who always cite history  whenever\r\n\r\nthey find a dearth of ideological arguments, let  me\r\n\r\nassure  them  that very shortly history  will  prove\r\n\r\nthat they are on our side, the side of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a convenient time to suspend.

Sir, this is the third time this House\r\n\r\nis  discussing foreign affairs. I remember the first\r\n\r\ntime  when we discussed foreign affairs, it  was  on\r\n\r\nthe  motion  on  Algeria moved by the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture.  At  that  time, this  House  censured  the\r\n\r\nFrench colonialists for their atrocities in Algeria.\r\n\r\nThe  second topic discussed was the motion moved  by\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister in regard to the assassination of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister of the Congo, Mr  Lumumba.  At\r\n\r\nthat time we condemned the Belgian colonialists  for\r\n\r\ntheir actions against the Congo people. Today we are\r\n\r\ndiscussing  the Dutch colonialists and their  bloody\r\n\r\nadministration  in West Irian. These  three  motions\r\n\r\nshow  us  very clearly that the motive is to condemn\r\n\r\nthe   imperialists  and  their  suppression  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  people.  The  two  previous  motions  were\r\n\r\nunanimously supported by this House. But today,  the\r\n\r\nmotion that we are discussing and the speeches  made\r\n\r\nsupporting the Indonesian people in their liberation\r\n\r\nof  West  Irian  are  different  from  the  previous\r\n\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have listened just now to the speech of the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister. It took him about  two  hours.  His\r\n\r\nspeech and the speeches by the Ministers in the past\r\n\r\nfew days clearly show the Government's stand on West\r\n\r\nIrian.  From  the Prime Minister's  speech,  we  can\r\n\r\nclearly see that the Government is not honest in its\r\n\r\nsupport of the Indonesian people in their liberation\r\n\r\nof  West  Irian. The Government says the  motive  of\r\n\r\nthis  motion  is  inspired by  the  Communists.  The\r\n\r\nspeech  by the Prime Minister clearly shows that  he\r\n\r\nis anti-Communist. He says that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government support the Indonesian people\r\n\r\nin their efforts to retake West Irian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1960, after his tour of Indonesia, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister signed a joint communique  with  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian   First  Minister,  Dr  Djuanda,   which\r\n\r\nclearly states the P.A.P. stand. I do not deny  that\r\n\r\nthis  communique  was  about the  support  which  we\r\n\r\nexpressed  for the Indonesian people.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  we  hope  the  West Irian question  could  be\r\n\r\nsolved  by  peaceful  means. However,  the  one  who\r\n\r\ndrafted  this  joint communique was  not  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  I  was one of the delegates  who  visited\r\n\r\nIndonesia. The joint communique was drafted  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Upper  Serangoon and  Mr  S.  Woodhull\r\n\r\njointly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in our support of the struggle\r\n\r\nagainst   colonialism,  it  is  not   necessary   to\r\n\r\ndistinguish  between those who belong to  this  camp\r\n\r\nand  those  who  belong to that camp and  those  who\r\n\r\nbelong to which political Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has said just\r\n\r\nnow  that  we  said at our mass rally that  we  love\r\n\r\npeace  but  that we love freedom more. According  to\r\n\r\nthe  analysis made by the Prime Minister,  this  was\r\n\r\nCommunistic. But the Prime Minister did  not  notice\r\n\r\nthat  this phrase was uttered by President  Soekarno\r\n\r\nat  a  mass  meeting  at  Djokjakarta  on  the  29th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1961. Does it mean that President Soekarno\r\n\r\nis a Communist?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nalso mentioned my colleague. He said that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson was pro-Communist and that he went over\r\n\r\nto  the  Communists in June 1960. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister said that  if  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson wanted to join the first class for the cause\r\n\r\nof  dialectical materialism, he would fail.  We  can\r\n\r\nsee very clearly that the speeches made by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  are  contradictory. If he  failed  in  his\r\n\r\ndialectical  materialism,  how  could  he  become  a\r\n\r\nCommunist?

Mr Speaker, Sir, when we  open  our\r\n\r\nmap, it clearly shows that West Irian belongs to the\r\n\r\nIndonesian   Republic.  It  is  part  of  Indonesian\r\n\r\nterritory.  Except  for  the  colonialists  and  the\r\n\r\nimperialists,   the  people  of  the   whole   world\r\n\r\nrecognise   West   Irian   as   belonging   to   the\r\n\r\nIndonesians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from news agency reports, we\r\n\r\nknow  that  Dutch  warships  have  opened  fire   on\r\n\r\nIndonesian  warships.  This has  clearly  shown  the\r\n\r\npeople in Asia and Africa that the Dutch do not want\r\n\r\nto  give back West Irian to the Indonesians. As part\r\n\r\nof  the  Asian people, we should solemnly  warn  the\r\n\r\nDutch  colonialists and the imperialists that  their\r\n\r\nparasitical   way   of  occupying   other   people's\r\n\r\nterritory  in  this twentieth century  will  not  be\r\n\r\ntolerated any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the 700,000 people in West Irian\r\n\r\nhave  been  exploited and suppressed  by  the  Dutch\r\n\r\ncolonialists for more than 300 years.  In  the  past\r\n\r\ntwo  years, they have still not been able  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe same political life as that of their compatriots\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia. They have also suffered at the  hands\r\n\r\nof  the  Dutch  colonialists. The Dutch colonialists\r\n\r\nhave  not  given  back West Irian to the  Indonesian\r\n\r\npeople.  From the time of the round-table conference\r\n\r\nup   to  1962,  the  Dutch  colonialists  have   not\r\n\r\nexpressed  their desire to surrender West  Irian  to\r\n\r\nthe  Republic of Indonesia. In the General  Assembly\r\n\r\nof the United Nations, the reasonable demands of the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  representatives  were  objected  to  and\r\n\r\nfrustrated  by  the imperialists. The so-called  big\r\n\r\nfamily  of nations have not been able to help  solve\r\n\r\nthe problems of the member States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recollect that in April\r\n\r\n1955,  a  conference was organised by the Afro-Asian\r\n\r\ncountries  at  Bandoeng. 29 nations  from  Asia  and\r\n\r\nAfrica  attended  and  they discussed  economic  and\r\n\r\ncultural co-operation. More important than that  was\r\n\r\nthe   fact  that  the  conference  passed  the  five\r\n\r\nprinciples  and  their  stand  against   the   Dutch\r\n\r\ncolonialists and their continued domination of  West\r\n\r\nIrian. This conference\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreflects   the  struggle  waged  by  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\npeople. Their anti-imperialist struggle is also part\r\n\r\nof  the struggle of the Afro-Asian peoples. In  this\r\n\r\nsolemn  struggle, there are two methods  of  solving\r\n\r\nthe  problem;  first,  the  problem  can  be  solved\r\n\r\npeacefully at the conference table; this is the best\r\n\r\nway   of  solving  the  problem:  secondly,  on  the\r\n\r\nbattlefield, i.e., by force: this is the last resort\r\n\r\nand  is  the  only alternative which  could  not  be\r\n\r\nsolved  by peaceful means. We, the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nare   glad  to  see  that  this  problem  is  solved\r\n\r\npeacefully. We are not against the Indonesian people\r\n\r\nfor trying to liberate West Irian by force, just  as\r\n\r\nthe Indian Government have used force to retake Goa.\r\n\r\nThe  Indonesian people wish to liberate West  Irian.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  first round of the Afro-Asian  people\r\n\r\nagainst  colonialism.  In  this  struggle,  we,  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, should not remain indifferent\r\n\r\nand  neutral.  We  should not  also  sabotage  their\r\n\r\nstruggle.  Therefore, my Chairman, representing  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, has clearly explained his  motive\r\n\r\nwhen he tabled this motion. In this struggle against\r\n\r\ncolonialism, there should not be any barrier  placed\r\n\r\non  language,  race or custom. There  should  be  no\r\n\r\ndistinction. As regards the people in Singapore, who\r\n\r\nare  still under colonialism, they should try  their\r\n\r\nbest  to help the Indonesian people. Therefore, this\r\n\r\nmotion  which has been tabled in this House reflects\r\n\r\ntheir  support of the Indonesian people against  the\r\n\r\nDutch colonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the P.A.P. theoretician, namely, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture, spoke on  this  motion.  His\r\n\r\nspeech showed the reactionary and childish stand the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has taken on the question of West Irian.  The\r\n\r\nFront Benches of the Government treated this serious\r\n\r\nproblem  with levity and frivolity. I doubt  whether\r\n\r\nthe  theories  propounded by the Front  Benches  are\r\n\r\nsupported by the Back Benches of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recollect that on the 22nd of\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1961,  the Minister for Culture  moved  a\r\n\r\nmotion  in  support of the Algerian  people.  It  is\r\n\r\nbarely  one  year since the motion was  tabled,  but\r\n\r\nthey have changed entirely. They have already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nturned  Right. In the motion tabled by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture  last year, he asked the Government  to\r\n\r\nallot $10,000 to help the Provisional Government  of\r\n\r\nAlgeria. He also appealed to the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nto support generously the Algerian Fund. At the same\r\n\r\ntime, the P.A.P. also donated $2,000 to this fund as\r\n\r\na  kind  of  show. Mr Speaker, Sir, the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  donated the money to the Algerian  people\r\n\r\nin  their  struggle against the French colonialists.\r\n\r\nThey gave what they could materially and spiritually\r\n\r\nto  support the Algerian people in order to let them\r\n\r\nfight    more   effectively   against   the   French\r\n\r\ncolonialists. But, on the question of the Indonesian\r\n\r\nstruggle  against  the Dutch over West  Irian,  what\r\n\r\nkind  of  argument did the Minister for Culture  put\r\n\r\nforward? Let me now quote what he said last week  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly concerning the question of West Irian.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister for Culture said the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nnot  only supported these conditions, but they  were\r\n\r\nalso  prepared to support the Indonesians to  invade\r\n\r\nand  to  continue to invade West Irian. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nhere  are  certain Barisan supporters who  willingly\r\n\r\nvolunteered   to  take  part  in  the   West   Irian\r\n\r\nliberation struggle. Is the P.A.P. really supporting\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian claim over West Irian? Its  attitude\r\n\r\nhas  been  entirely  exposed by the  speech  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture. What is  invasion?  Military\r\n\r\ninvasion?   What  is  the  definition  of  \"military\r\n\r\ninvasion\" as used by the Minister for Culture?  Does\r\n\r\nit mean that the Indonesians have to use force as  a\r\n\r\nlast  resort to claim back West Irian? Does it  mean\r\n\r\nthat this is the so-called military invasion by  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian people? When a country could not but  use\r\n\r\nforce to reclaim its territories, does it mean  that\r\n\r\nthis can be termed as a military invasion? Now,  who\r\n\r\nhas occupied West Irian? Who has invaded West Irian?\r\n\r\nAccording to the logic of the Minister for  Culture,\r\n\r\nIndia's reclamation of Goa by force is also  a  kind\r\n\r\nof  military  invasion. Does he mean  that?  If  the\r\n\r\nhouse  of the Minister for Culture has been occupied\r\n\r\nby  other people and he uses the police to  take  it\r\n\r\nback, can it be termed as a military invasion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Rajaratnam):</b> What\r\n\r\nabout P.A.P. branches?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nif  the motion on Algeria tabled by the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture  had been hypocritical, then his  speech  on\r\n\r\nthe  motion on West Irian must be a reactionary  one\r\n\r\nand  a kind of sell-out speech. The people will then\r\n\r\nsee clearly who are really selling out the interests\r\n\r\nof  the people, who are really pro-colonialists, and\r\n\r\nwho  are  really anti-colonialists in the course  of\r\n\r\nthe  struggle against the colonialists. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs and his colleagues  have  already\r\n\r\nalleged  on  many occasions that the action  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers  who pasted up posters was against  the  law\r\n\r\nand  a  breach  of the regulations.  It  is  a  very\r\n\r\nregrettable matter. This goes to show that they  are\r\n\r\nalready  deviating  from the  original  course  they\r\n\r\nadopted  once  upon a time  - they are deviating  from\r\n\r\nthe people. The people who went out to paste posters\r\n\r\nin  support  of West Irian were workers and  farmers\r\n\r\nwho   had   suffered  under  colonial   rule.   They\r\n\r\nunderstand that the Indonesian struggle against  the\r\n\r\nDutch  over  the question of West Irian  is  closely\r\n\r\nconnected with them, and that was why they took part\r\n\r\nin  putting up posters. On the other hand, as I have\r\n\r\njust  said, they belong to the working class-farmers\r\n\r\nand workers. They made use of their spare time - after\r\n\r\ntheir  normal working time; that is to say,  in  the\r\n\r\nnight  time - to go out and paste posters.  In  actual\r\n\r\nfact,  they did not go out to paste posters  in  the\r\n\r\nearly  hours of the morning. For instance, in  Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu,  a few workers were detained by the police  at\r\n\r\nabout  9  p.m. and not at 1 a.m. or 2  a.m. in  the\r\n\r\nmorning. They were brought to the Paya Lebar  Police\r\n\r\nStation   awaiting  investigation  by  the   Special\r\n\r\nBranch. They were kept there up to midnight.  So  it\r\n\r\nis  the  pro-colonialist stand of  the  P.A.P. that\r\n\r\nshould be blamed; also the bureaucratic attitude  of\r\n\r\nthe police. I would like to express my gratitude and\r\n\r\nadmiration   to  the  workers  who  were   arrested.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  reports, some were  detained  on  two\r\n\r\noccasions  for  two nights by the police.  All  this\r\n\r\ngoes to show that in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  anti-colonial struggle the reactionary  group,\r\n\r\nin spite of resorting to all methods of suppression,\r\n\r\ncould  not  suppress the fervour of the  people  who\r\n\r\ntake part in the anti-colonial struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday, we heard a speech made by One who\r\n\r\nappeared to be worse than a Fascist - the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance.  After hearing his speech, I  came  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that  he was worse than  a  Fascist.  He\r\n\r\ndisclosed  his true colours in his speech.  He  said\r\n\r\nthat the Dutch had not derived any benefit from West\r\n\r\nIrian and that they did not acquire much money;  but\r\n\r\nthat, on the other hand, they had to invest a lot of\r\n\r\nmoney in building schools, hospitals, roads, and  so\r\n\r\non.  Obviously he was speaking in the same  vein  as\r\n\r\nthe colonialists. There is no difference between the\r\n\r\nopinions   he   holds   and  those   held   by   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  [Interruption] If you will  refer  to\r\n\r\nthe official records, you will then know what he has\r\n\r\nsaid.  His  speech was very puerile and foolish.  He\r\n\r\nhas  forgotten that the main purpose of the invasion\r\n\r\nof  colonies by the imperialists - such as the French,\r\n\r\nPortuguese, Belgians and the British  - was  to  carry\r\n\r\nout  economic exploitation with a view  to  personal\r\n\r\nbenefit. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me give a very simple\r\n\r\nand practical example to show that the speech of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance was nonsensical and puerile. On\r\n\r\n23rd  June, 1959, the Financial Times published that\r\n\r\nthe  British obtained over \u0153600 million  every  year\r\n\r\nfrom the colonies. As an economist, the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  was not aware of this. How can  he  explain\r\n\r\naway  this  kind  of  economic exploitation  by  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday, he made a speech in which he\r\n\r\nmentioned the merger forum organised by the  Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  of Commerce. He described it as  the  fifth\r\n\r\nround with the Barisan Sosialis. In my opinion,  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber  of Commerce organised  this  forum\r\n\r\nbecause  after  the  speech of the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara last year - it was a policy speech on behalf of\r\n\r\nthe Government - the Government did not give any reply\r\n\r\nto  questions raised by civic organisations. Instead\r\n\r\nthe Government continued with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits  attitude of smearing and giving excuses,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  which the representatives at  the  forum\r\n\r\nwere very dissatisfied with the answers given by the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  forum  was  closely   watched   by\r\n\r\npersonnel  from  the Special Branch. The  Government\r\n\r\nsent  out  personnel  from the  Special  Branch  and\r\n\r\nphotographs  were  taken of all representatives  who\r\n\r\nwere  allotted special seats. This clearly  goes  to\r\n\r\nshow that the P.A.P. do not only want to control the\r\n\r\nPress and the radio but also all civic organisations\r\n\r\nin   order   to   carry   out  their   retrogressive\r\n\r\nconstitutional arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the reference to the\r\n\r\nfifth  round  by the Minister for Finance,  we  have\r\n\r\nalready seen his true colours. We have been used  to\r\n\r\nhis  smears in the past. We understand that clearly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he would say that the question of West Irian\r\n\r\nis  the sixth round and the question of Malaysia  is\r\n\r\nthe  seventh  round. We are not  interested  in  all\r\n\r\nthis.  What We are interested in is that the welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  people should not be adversely affected  by\r\n\r\nthe  so-called fifth or sixth round struggle by  the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the Barisan Sosialis will try our best to\r\n\r\nunite  our people and to step up our efforts in  the\r\n\r\nanti-colonial struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  I  first  moved this motion, I never  for  one\r\n\r\nmoment thought that the debate would develop in  the\r\n\r\nway t has.

Some say we are proud.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministers  used  insulting  words,  calling  us\r\n\r\npuerile,   half-baked  anti-colonialists,  Communist\r\n\r\nstooges, hypocrites and a whole host of words  which\r\n\r\nyou normally do not allow, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown must\r\n\r\nknow that certain words used in certain contexts may\r\n\r\nnot be offensive or insulting to Members. But I must\r\n\r\nrely on Members getting up on a point of order,  if,\r\n\r\nin fact, a word is offensive or insulting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what I say has\r\n\r\nno  reflection  on the Chair. It happened  when  you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow that. That is\r\n\r\nalso a reflection on the Chair. Even if I am not  in\r\n\r\nand the reflection is on the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As I have said, Sir, the issue\r\n\r\nbefore  the House is a simple one. The motion  says,\r\n\r\n\"That  this  House  , expresses admiration  for  the\r\n\r\ndetermination  and courage of the Indonesian  people\r\n\r\nand  expresses  full sympathy with their  hopes  and\r\n\r\naspirations\"  - just expressing our sympathy  and  our\r\n\r\nadmiration  for  the determination and  courage  and\r\n\r\nhopes  and  aspirations  of the  Indonesian  people.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very much wrong with that. And  the\r\n\r\nmotion  also \"calls upon the people of Singapore  to\r\n\r\ngive  their  wholehearted support to our  neighbours\r\n\r\nand friends,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   people  of  Indonesia,  in  their   just   and\r\n\r\nlegitimate  struggle  against colonial  domination\".\r\n\r\nAgain,  Sir,  there is nothing wrong  with  that.  A\r\n\r\nsimple,  straightforward issue.  When  I  moved  the\r\n\r\nmotion  I  addressed the House in all solemnity  and\r\n\r\nseriousness.  I  made it a point to explain  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  the West Irian issue s an anti-colonial\r\n\r\nissue.  All  political Parties that are truly  anti-colonial   should  not  have  any  difficulty,   any\r\n\r\nreservation,   any  hesitation  in  supporting   the\r\n\r\nmotion.  And  if they are truly anti-colonial,  they\r\n\r\nshould  not worry about the question of which  Party\r\n\r\nhas  moved this motion. If only they are truly anti-colonial  and if they are sincere, they  should  not\r\n\r\nread  into the anti-colonial sentiments more meaning\r\n\r\nthan  there  is, and meanings which are  not  there.\r\n\r\nThey  should  not fear that their support  may  give\r\n\r\ncredit  to  the Party that has moved the motion.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  we in the Barisan Sosialis make no secret  of\r\n\r\nthe fact that we are uncompromisingly anti-colonial,\r\n\r\neither now or in the future. And if the P.A.P.,  for\r\n\r\nexample, had moved this motion, we would have  given\r\n\r\nour support unreservedly and without qualification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what has happened? All their talk of support\r\n\r\nfor  the  motion  has  been  introduced  with  party\r\n\r\npolitics. They bring in a lot of irrelevant matters,\r\n\r\nand  they  point to our insincerity. All  this  only\r\n\r\ngoes  to  prove the hypocrisy of the P.A.P. Possibly\r\n\r\nthey  support  the motion as a matter  of  political\r\n\r\nexpediency, for unfortunately they are forced into a\r\n\r\nposition  where they have to support this motion.  I\r\n\r\nwill  come  to that later, Sir,In actual  fact,  in\r\n\r\ntheir  heart  of  hearts, they  are  not  really  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  motion at all. We  are  forced  to\r\n\r\nassume   this,   as  there  is  no  other   possible\r\n\r\nexplanation for their attitude and behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question, as I say, is whether we are pro-colonial or anti-colonial. Are we pro-Dutch or are\r\n\r\nwe  pro-Indonesia? It is as simple as that, and they\r\n\r\nequivocate,  they  twist  and  turn,  and  say,  \"We\r\n\r\nsupport and we do not support.\" What do they  really\r\n\r\nmean?  The  U.M.N.O., for example, say that  we  are\r\n\r\ninsincere and they advance the reason for  their  so\r\n\r\nthinking on the fact that we had put up posters late\r\n\r\nat night. That has already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  answered by the Member for Choa Chu Kang.  But\r\n\r\nlet  me  just remind them once more: that as in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in the days of old, our workers are voluntary\r\n\r\nworkers. They can come out to help voluntarily  only\r\n\r\nafter they have finished their day's work, and  have\r\n\r\ntaken  their bath and have had their dinner. But  me\r\n\r\nP.A.P. say that just because these people come  out\r\n\r\nat night, therefore, we are insincere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Till 1 a.m.!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Surely that is not a good\r\n\r\nreason for calling us insincere.

They also say that we held the rally\r\n\r\nin  Geylang Serai in order that we might gain  Malay\r\n\r\nsupport.  I  must ask: Why not, Sir? What  is  wrong\r\n\r\nwith  that?

This is not a racial\r\n\r\nissue.  It  is  an issue clear and simple,  repeated\r\n\r\nagain  and  again,  of whether  you  want  to  fight\r\n\r\nagainst colonialism or not. They may think it is  an\r\n\r\nabstract idea. And to the P.A.P. it is, because they\r\n\r\nhave completely forgotten what anti-colonialism  is.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. come out with the question of  peace  or\r\n\r\nwar.  As  I have said, Sir, the P.A.P. unfortunately\r\n\r\nhave  been  pushed  into  a  very  unfortunate   and\r\n\r\nembarrassing  position. First, because  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis first came out with a statement in  support\r\n\r\nof the Indonesian people on the 28th December, 1961.\r\n\r\nSecond, because the Barisan Sosialis held a rally in\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai in support of Indonesia's struggle and\r\n\r\nbecause   the   P.A.P. were   forced   again    by\r\n\r\ncircumstances  to allow us to hold  a  rally  there.\r\n\r\nThis  has to be explained to you, Sir.

We  have\r\n\r\nshown them up to be completely pro-colonial in their\r\n\r\noutlook and approach. They have deviated so much  to\r\n\r\nthe Right that they do not know what anti-colonialism\r\n\r\nis all about. In this particular motion, in spite of\r\n\r\nthemselves,   they  have  to  support  the   motion.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, their secret will be shown up for all  to\r\n\r\nsee,  and I am sure the Prime Minister does not like\r\n\r\nthat.  He would like to keep up the posture that  he\r\n\r\nis  still anti-colonial, and he would like  to  show\r\n\r\nthe people that he is still fighting colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, compelled to support this motion, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis now also forced to play politics. They say we are\r\n\r\nnot  sincere.  They  accuse us of  playing  politics\r\n\r\ninstead, and they adopt the contemptible attitude of\r\n\r\nmaking fun, joking, laughing, and smearing - an air of\r\n\r\nlight-heartedness, frivolity and ridicule.  Looking\r\n\r\nat  their feces, Sir, you can see hypocrisy  written\r\n\r\nall over them. We are deciding a very serious issue,\r\n\r\nSir,  and  see what they do - they laugh!

Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  in  order  to  show  that  they  are  anti-colonial,  they also bring up their pet  subject  of\r\n\r\nCommunism.  They  do  so  first  by  belittling  our\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai rally. They harped on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact  that  there were only about 5,000  people  and\r\n\r\nthat we had to shepherd-in unions in order to form a\r\n\r\ncrowd. Sir, we have had pictures taken of the rally.\r\n\r\nFor  the  edification of the House and you,  we  can\r\n\r\neasily  see  that  from  only  one  section  of  the\r\n\r\ncrowd - that   is   here    - [indicating]   the    most\r\n\r\nconservative estimate on this picture alone would be\r\n\r\n8,000. We ourselves have estimated the crowd  to  be\r\n\r\n10,000 but there are other people who have estimated\r\n\r\nthe  crowd to be anywhere between 12,000 and 15,000.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime  Minister should have  seen  the  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion there. If he had gone there, he would not\r\n\r\nhave  been  able to pass through. That alone  should\r\n\r\nshow what happened.

I  remember  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister saying something about suckling babes.

I personally do not know the three  ladies\r\n\r\nconcerned.  But  we  take strong  exception  to  the\r\n\r\nridicule which Members of the Government Party  have\r\n\r\nshowered  on  these volunteers. By  this  very  fact\r\n\r\nalone, the P.A.P. have proved to the House that they\r\n\r\nare  not  sincere  at all in the way  they  talk  of\r\n\r\nsupporting this motion. By the manner in which  they\r\n\r\nridicule  these volunteers, they have already  shown\r\n\r\nthat  they  are not friendly towards the  Indonesian\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order.

Member:</b> Who is starting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, it is perfectly natural\r\n\r\nfor  people who feel deeply about certain things  to\r\n\r\nvolunteer for service in West Irian, especially when\r\n\r\nthe  issue  has turned into a burning issue.  It  is\r\n\r\nunnatural, to say the least, to stop this inevitable\r\n\r\npolitical  process in spite of what the P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nsaid  and  will  say. It does not take  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  to incite them to volunteer, in  fact,  so\r\n\r\nfar  as  we know, popular sentiment as regards  West\r\n\r\nIrian  has existed long before now. And if the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  does not take my statement as the  genuine\r\n\r\ntruth,  I am sure he can inquire from the Indonesian\r\n\r\nConsulate  whether there have indeed been volunteers\r\n\r\nshowing  readiness to help the Indonesian people  as\r\n\r\nregards  the  West Irian issue. It is as  simple  as\r\n\r\nthat.  Why must they link it up with this and  that,\r\n\r\nand  twist  and turn it into something sinister?  In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  might mention that there are other  people\r\n\r\nwho  feel  agitated over the West Irian  issue.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  the Member for Geylang Serai himself  has\r\n\r\ntold us that he felt so deeply about the matter that\r\n\r\nhe  helped  to  run  guns for the freedom  fighters.\r\n\r\nThings  like  this have happened long, long  before.\r\n\r\nThey  keep  on  asking  why  we  ourselves  do   not\r\n\r\nvolunteer  when  we  talk of  supporting  the  anti-colonial struggle in West Irian. Sir, this is a very\r\n\r\nvicious  question.  After all,  let  me  remind  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. that  they themselves had  held  rallies  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of the Algerian struggle and in support  of\r\n\r\nthe condemnation of the murder of Lumumba. Did they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  any  time suggest to themselves that they should\r\n\r\ngo  and  fight in the Congo or in Algeria?  Did  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  do  that? The P.A.P. want  the  13\r\n\r\nAssemblymen to volunteer. They are even  willing  to\r\n\r\ndraw  out  funds from the P.A.P. for the  first  one\r\n\r\nhundred  volunteers  from the Barisan  Sosialis  and\r\n\r\nthey  would  join  the merry chorus  and  say,  \"Bon\r\n\r\nvoyage.\"  Let  me tell them this, Sir.  This  is  no\r\n\r\njoking  matter to the 96 million Indonesian  people.\r\n\r\nThe  time  may  come  when everybody  will  have  to\r\n\r\nundergo  heavy  sacrifices.  Families  may  be  torn\r\n\r\napart. Fathers may have to mourn for sons. Wives may\r\n\r\nhave  to  mourn for husbands, sisters for  brothers,\r\n\r\nand friends may never meet again. Do they think that\r\n\r\nit  is  such  a frivolous matter that they  have  to\r\n\r\nlaugh about it? Do they dare to laugh in the face of\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian people? Let them laugh that out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat what the Member for Thomson has said,\r\n\r\nSir.  Even if they do not want to respect the  mover\r\n\r\nof  the  motion, even if they do not want to respect\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis, at least let them  pay  some\r\n\r\nrespect  to  the Indonesian people. The  West  Irian\r\n\r\nissue  is  not  a  simple, joking  matter  to  them.\r\n\r\nRecently,    President    Soekarno    was     almost\r\n\r\nassassinated. That is no joking matter. I was hoping\r\n\r\nthat  Members opposite would join with me  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"What  a  barbaric thing it was.\" But  instead  they\r\n\r\npoked fun. They ridiculed. Volunteers from Singapore\r\n\r\nor  from  anywhere for that matter,  will  not  make\r\n\r\nmuch,  material difference to what is  happening  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  The Indonesians have nearly 100  million\r\n\r\npeople against Holland's meagre 10 million, or  less\r\n\r\nthan  that. They could just swarm over them.  A  few\r\n\r\nhundred  or a few thousand from Singapore  will  not\r\n\r\nmake  any  difference to the numerical  strength  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia. But we admire these volunteers for  their\r\n\r\nnoble  gesture. It is this noble gesture, Sir,  that\r\n\r\ngoes to give moral support to the Indonesian people.\r\n\r\nThat  is all we ask for. Not material strength  from\r\n\r\nMembers of the Government Benches. As far as  I  can\r\n\r\nsee  with regard to some Members, a strong wind  can\r\n\r\nblow  them  off the ground. They cannot  even  stand\r\n\r\nupright.  No  wonder, the Member for  Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\nsaid that the debate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  an  embarrassment  to  the  Indonesian  people.\r\n\r\nBecause,  after the Prime Minister had  signed  that\r\n\r\nsolemn  document  of  support  two  years  ago,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment now has turned round and made fun of  our\r\n\r\nfriends who are hoping for a gesture of support.  We\r\n\r\nget  derogatory remarks from the Government  Benches\r\n\r\nabout people getting senile, needing gimmicks. We in\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis definitely do not need gimmicks\r\n\r\nand  we are not senile. Everybody in Singapore knows\r\n\r\nthat.  I would not like to compare, Sir. Comparisons\r\n\r\nare  odious, they say, and it may be mistaken as  an\r\n\r\narrogant attitude on our part when we say how strong\r\n\r\nwe  are  as  against the P.A.P.

Reference has already been made to  it  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Choa Chu Kang. But the point I  want\r\n\r\nto  make is this. The joint statement was drafted by\r\n\r\nMr  S.  Woodhull in conjunction with the Indonesian\r\n\r\nofficials, and - now this is important - it included the\r\n\r\nWest  Irian issue. And when the Prime Minister heard\r\n\r\nthat  the  West  Irian  issue was  included  in  the\r\n\r\nstatement,  he  was  very,  very  unhappy.   It   is\r\n\r\nunfortunate that I have to mention this, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> On a point of elucidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way. The\r\n\r\nMember does not give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All this shows that the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nin  their  support  of  the motion,  have  not  been\r\n\r\nsincere.  If they had been, they would have  held  a\r\n\r\nrally in support of Indonesia too. You will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremember  that  we held a rally in  support  of  the\r\n\r\nAlgerian  struggle  and we  also  held  a  rally  in\r\n\r\ncondemnation of the murder of Lumumba. Of course, at\r\n\r\nthat  time, there was the Hong Lim by-election which\r\n\r\nwas  about to come on. In answer to the charge  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. had lost all anti-colonial fervour,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. were compelled to dig up something  to  show\r\n\r\nthat  they  were not pro-colonial and had  not  lost\r\n\r\ntheir anti-colonial fervour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Sir, I might say I felt very\r\n\r\nunhappy and sorry that the Prime Minister had  again\r\n\r\nthought it good politics to make fun of the name  of\r\n\r\nLumumba.  We  do  not hold brief for any  particular\r\n\r\nperson,  but the name Lumumba today is held in  high\r\n\r\nesteem by all the people who are taking part in  the\r\n\r\nanti-colonial  struggle.  But  what  did  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  say? If he gave consent to naming anything\r\n\r\nafter  the  name Lumumba, he said,  it  would  be  a\r\n\r\ncircus.   Such  derogatory  remarks  from  a   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of a so-called elected people's government\r\n\r\nis  very,  very  hard to believe. All these  remarks\r\n\r\nshow  up  the actual nature of the P.A.P., and  also\r\n\r\nincidentally why we left the P.A.P. So you  see  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. actually support this motion  Just  to  suit\r\n\r\nthemselves,  as I have demonstrated all  along.  But\r\n\r\nhere  is where the fun starts. Having supported  the\r\n\r\nanti-colonial struggle of the Indonesian  people  in\r\n\r\nspite of themselves, the P.A.P. leaders have now  to\r\n\r\nexplain  their inconsistent stand, in  other  words,\r\n\r\nthey  have to rationalise their inconsistencies  and\r\n\r\ncontradictions.  The Minister for Culture  says  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. support  the Indonesian struggle  over  West\r\n\r\nIrian  because  they support the same  principle  as\r\n\r\nthey  support  the principle of Malaysia.  He  makes\r\n\r\ngreat  play  of the words \"Malaysia is  historically\r\n\r\ninevitable;  and  similarly,  because  reunification\r\n\r\nbetween  West  Irian and Indonesia  is  historically\r\n\r\ninevitable,   therefore,  the  P.A.P. support   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian people in their struggle to recover  West\r\n\r\nIrian.\"  I  say  this  to the  Government  Ministers\r\n\r\nsitting  opposite: \"Go and tell that to the Marines,\r\n\r\nthe Dutch Marines!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Not the Dutchmen of Malaysia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> First, let me debunk this\r\n\r\n\"inevitable\" theory of the Minister for Culture.  If\r\n\r\ninevitability  were  to be carried  to  its  logical\r\n\r\nconclusion, then one would have expected  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  include Indonesia in this matter.  I  am  not\r\n\r\ngetting  into  the controversy of Malaysia,  how  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  or  should not be. But if they  want  to\r\n\r\nargue,  if  they want to use the word  \"inevitable\",\r\n\r\nthen  let us say the inevitable conclusion  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  a merger - a union of a  much  larger\r\n\r\nunit,  and it includes Indonesia. Is that  what  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture says? Is that the  logic?  Are\r\n\r\nthose  the dialectics of the P.A.P.? Of course,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance knows that it is all nonsense.\r\n\r\nSo  he  quickly tries to turn the attention  of  the\r\n\r\npeople to the stand of the Barisan Sosialis instead,\r\n\r\nand  attempts  to show the so-called inconsistencies\r\n\r\nand  contradictions in our stand as regards Malaysia\r\n\r\nand West Irian. He says in the case of Malaysia,  we\r\n\r\nask for consultations, control of internal security,\r\n\r\nself-determination  and general  elections.  And  he\r\n\r\nasks, why do we not ask the same in the case of West\r\n\r\nIrian?  Sir, the trouble with the P.A.P. is that  in\r\n\r\ntheir dictatorship and supercilious arrogance, their\r\n\r\nleaders  have mistaken the wood for the trees.  They\r\n\r\nhave  deviated so far from the original  stand  that\r\n\r\nthey now cannot distinguish friend from foe, and foe\r\n\r\nfrom   friend.  They  have  lost  the  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nfervour,  as I have said, and they try to masquerade\r\n\r\ntheir  true  nature.  They  use  catch  phrases   of\r\n\r\ninevitability  of  this and inevitability  of  that,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  know  such words  are  used  by  real\r\n\r\nLeftists. They do not see the West Irian issue as an\r\n\r\nanti-colonial issue. They do not see it as an  issue\r\n\r\nof  the  struggle of oppressed peoples  against  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists and the imperialists. They do  not  see\r\n\r\nthat  it is part of a global struggle. To us, it  is\r\n\r\njust  as simple as that. And either they do not  see\r\n\r\nit or, if they see it, purposely twist it, purposely\r\n\r\npretend not to see it, refuse to see it. It is  just\r\n\r\nan  issue of the people fighting against colonialism\r\n\r\nand  in  our  support, we want to  add,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nindicated in my speech when I moved the motion,  our\r\n\r\nsmall voice to that of the world forum of more  than\r\n\r\nhalf the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  of  the  world. Is there anything  wrong  in\r\n\r\nthat?  There  is no similarity between Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nthe West Irian issue.

Sir, I was outside the\r\n\r\nChamber and did not wish to interrupt the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown. He stated that the joint declaration  on\r\n\r\nWest  Irian signed by Dr Djuanda and myself was  an\r\n\r\ninsertion  of a draft by Mr Sandra Woodhull.  As  a\r\n\r\npoint  of order, I would like now to ask you when   I \r\n\r\ncould  make  a statement in this Chamber to  clarify\r\n\r\nthis, because I think this is a matter of some grave\r\n\r\nimportance and one should not in matters  of  inter-State relations make so mischievous a statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. But I\r\n\r\ntake  it the Prime Minister could allege that he  is\r\n\r\nbeing  misunderstood in some material  part  of  his\r\n\r\nspeech, and the Standing Order is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A Member who has spoken to a question may again\r\n\r\nbe  heard  to offer an explanation of some  material\r\n\r\npart of his speech which has been misunderstood; but\r\n\r\nhe shall not introduce any new matter.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that when the Member for Queenstown has\r\n\r\ncompleted  his speech, the Prime Minister  may  make\r\n\r\nhis clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was trying to explain that\r\n\r\nthere is no similarity between Malaysia and the West\r\n\r\nIrian  issue.  In  the case of West Irian,  complete\r\n\r\nsovereignty  of the whole of the Dutch  East  Indies\r\n\r\nwas transferred to the Indonesian people at a round-table  conference in the Hague in August  1949.  The\r\n\r\nceremonial  transfer was effected in December  1949,\r\n\r\nthe  same year, and the transfer of sovereignty  was\r\n\r\nunconditional and irrevocable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson referred to the International\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Justice in his argument. But  we  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis are not lawyers  and  we  are  not\r\n\r\narguing  in  any  court of law. We  only  deal  with\r\n\r\ngeneral  principles and, to us, the issue is  simply\r\n\r\none of driving out colonialism\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  of  restoring national sovereignty and national\r\n\r\nintegrity. In the case of the proposed Malaysia, the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories  are  all  separate.  If  Sabah,\r\n\r\nBrunei  and Sarawak are to form some sort  of  union\r\n\r\nfrom  separate  entities, then the people  in  these\r\n\r\nareas  must  decide.  If the P.A.P.'s  argument  for\r\n\r\nunification  is that all these separate  territories\r\n\r\nare under the same British flag, if that is the only\r\n\r\nlogical contention they have, then I must ask  them,\r\n\r\nwhat  about other areas  - what about Hongkong, Malta,\r\n\r\nAden?  They  are  all under the same  British  flag.\r\n\r\nSimilarly.  Sir,  I  take it that  Indonesia  Cannot\r\n\r\nclaim  Dutch  Guiana in South America, because  they\r\n\r\nare all separate. They do not claim territories just\r\n\r\nbecause they happen to be under the same flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difference which I would like to stress\r\n\r\nbetween  Malaysia and the West Irian issue is  this.\r\n\r\nIndonesia  recovers West Irian as part of  Indonesia\r\n\r\nand  the West Irians are going to be treated  as  as\r\n\r\nequal brothers and sisters of other Indonesians  and\r\n\r\nnot  as outcasts, and the West Irians will be given,\r\n\r\nas  we  can  see  from  the  pronouncements  by  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian   authorities,   full   citizenship   and\r\n\r\npolitical  freedom. This is not what will happen  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia. As far as Singapore is concerned, we  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  given full citizenship and we will  not  be\r\n\r\ngiven political freedom. Where is the similarity? In\r\n\r\nfact, I would say there is a contrast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just touch briefly on this self-determination which the Minister for Culture and the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister talk so much about.  Just  like  the\r\n\r\nword  \"merger\",  Sir,  the word \"determination\"  has\r\n\r\nbeen  twisted  out  of  shape  by  the  P.A.P.   The\r\n\r\nprinciple   of  self-determination  is  raised   and\r\n\r\nsupported  by  the  Dutch for two reasons.  One,  to\r\n\r\nencourage the formation of a puppet State and,  two,\r\n\r\nto  prevent  the  reunification of West  Irian  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   That   is,   to   sabotage   Indonesian\r\n\r\nterritorial    integrity   and   sovereignty,    and\r\n\r\ntherefore,  it is a pro-colonial move.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   wants  self-determination  for   entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent  reasons. Self-determination is  to  allow\r\n\r\nus, even you included, Mr Prime Minister -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

They can be said to be -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Russians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - Tshombes, Syngman Rhees, Ngo\r\n\r\nDinh  Diems and Chiang Kai-sheks. That is what  they\r\n\r\nare.  That  is  why the P.A.P. are  supporting  this\r\n\r\nMalaysia scheme together with -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Chiang Kai-shek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the British colonialists and\r\n\r\nother Right-wing forces. But before I close on  this\r\n\r\ntheme,  one  last word on this \"inevitability\",  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  this. One thing is inevitable in the  next\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections - the P.A.P. will be  out  and  the\r\n\r\nMinisters will be jobless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is sometimes a little entertaining to\r\n\r\nlisten  to  the Minister for Finance to see  how  he\r\n\r\nties himself into knots and contradictions. You will\r\n\r\nremember he agreed that West Irian should go back to\r\n\r\nthe Indonesians. He ridiculed the volunteers, saying\r\n\r\nthat  it  is nonsense to fight, and yet he came  out\r\n\r\nwith a thesis that force would have to be used if no\r\n\r\nother  way  was  possible.  Then  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  came  out  with his plea  for  a  peaceful\r\n\r\nsettlement. I was most touched by what he said,  and\r\n\r\nwe  all  share with him those sentiments. I said  as\r\n\r\nmuch  in my opening speech. Probably when the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister said that, he did not hear me when  I\r\n\r\nfirst addressed the House on this issue. I said that\r\n\r\nwe  all hope for a peaceful settlement, and we  hope\r\n\r\nthat  those \"first\" shots will be the \"last\"  shots.\r\n\r\nAs   we  have  seen  in  the  newspapers,  even  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  people themselves, through Major-General\r\n\r\nJani,  Chief  of  West  Irian  Liberation  Operation\r\n\r\nStaff, have also expressed their hope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  some  peaceful solution will come out  of  the\r\n\r\nWest  Irian dispute. But I think we should  be  very\r\n\r\nclear  on one point. However the dispute may develop\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia  and West Irian, it  is  entirely  the\r\n\r\naffair of the Indonesians themselves. We on our part\r\n\r\ncan  only  hope for peace. We cannot  say  that  the\r\n\r\nsettlement  must be by peace or that it must  be  by\r\n\r\nwar.  Whatever  the  method  the  Indonesian  people\r\n\r\nthemselves choose, we, as outsiders, have no say  on\r\n\r\nthe  matter.  If  the Indonesian people  think  that\r\n\r\nforce  has to be used, well, that is what it  should\r\n\r\nbe.  If they think that force is necessary, who  are\r\n\r\nwe  to say. \"No, you just put down your guns and  be\r\n\r\nshot at by the Dutch.\" Surely, that is not what  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are  advocating.  Therefore,  we  are   not\r\n\r\ninciting any one at all when we ask for support  for\r\n\r\nthe   Indonesians.  We  should  not  be   blind   to\r\n\r\nrealities.  The Dutch - as the Member for Thomson  has\r\n\r\nsaid - have been holding on to West Irian by force. If\r\n\r\nin   the  final  resort,  when  patience  has   been\r\n\r\ncompletely  exhausted, as in the case  of  Goa,  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  people  take  up  arms  to   force   the\r\n\r\nimperialists out of West Irian, then I say  that  we\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Indonesian people. The issue  is  very\r\n\r\nclear:  whether  we  support the  Indonesian  people\r\n\r\nunder  those circumstances, or we support the Dutch.\r\n\r\nLet the House declare itself straightaway there.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  simple decision and there is no need to argue\r\n\r\non it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has accused us of making fierce speeches, shouting empty slogans and inciting the people to volunteer for something which they do not understand. He says he knows what war is. I do not know, Sir,I know that the Member for Anson knows what war is. He was a prisoner of war. I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  anyone on the Government  Front  Benches\r\n\r\nknows anything about war. They do not know what  war\r\n\r\nis. But I can tell them that I know what war is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!

We had to push\r\n\r\ntrains for more than two weeks before we could  come\r\n\r\nback.   We   had  to  push  trains - not  sitting   in\r\n\r\ntrains - over wrecked bridges. The first thing when we\r\n\r\narrived in Kanchanaburi - I can get witnesses to prove\r\n\r\nit - we  were  nearly bombed to smithereens.  We  were\r\n\r\nvery lucky. We escaped the bombing by about 10 or 15\r\n\r\nminutes.  I just want to tell the P.A.P. - it  is  not\r\n\r\nthat  I want to talk about it, Sir - that we know what\r\n\r\nwar  is - not the Deputy Prime Minister whose only war\r\n\r\nexperience consisted of carrying bed-pans.  That  is\r\n\r\nnot  war  experience. For a person  who  was  merely\r\n\r\nmewling  and puking in a nurse's arms - as it  were - to\r\n\r\ntry  to  tell  people who have war experience  about\r\n\r\nwar, is laughable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are a stooge of the\r\n\r\nBritish then, are you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister made\r\n\r\na plea that there should be no war. The Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  contradicted him by  saying  that  when  it\r\n\r\nbecame  necessary he did not mind war.  He  did  not\r\n\r\nmind war if it was a quick one - if it was going to be\r\n\r\na   blitzkrieg.  He  would  mind  if  the  war   was\r\n\r\nprotracted.  Under those circumstances,  he  thought\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian  people would suffer  and  that  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian economy would not be able to stand up  to\r\n\r\nthe  strain. That is the thesis of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.  Of  course, when they come to  that,  they\r\n\r\nmust  link  it  up  with the Barisan  Sosialis.  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance quoted the other day,  and  the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister   himself  quoted  again   tonight,\r\n\r\npassages  from  the  speech made by  the  Secretary-General  of  the Barisan Sosialis at the mass  rally\r\n\r\nheld in Geylang Serai two Sundays ago. They want  to\r\n\r\ngive   the  impression  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nadvocates violence, because then it will all link up\r\n\r\nwith  their smear campaign that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nis   a   Communist  front  organisation.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister quoted almost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  same  passages which the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nquoted  the other night. But let me tell them  this.\r\n\r\nIn  their  quotations,  they  made  sure  that  they\r\n\r\ntwisted  and  distorted the whole thing.  Paragraphs\r\n\r\nwere  quoted  out of context; in one paragraph  they\r\n\r\nquoted  only  the second half. I will  only  mention\r\n\r\nthree  paragraphs in this paper from which the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has quoted today, and I will show  how  he\r\n\r\nhas  tried  to give a false and distorted impression\r\n\r\nto  the  people.  One - may  I  read  the  passage  in\r\n\r\nMandarin,  Sir, and it is also from the  same  paper\r\n\r\nwhich he quoted:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Assembly Interpreter's version in English):\r\n\r\n`Indonesia  is  a  peace loving and  neutral  strong\r\n\r\nforce  in South-East Asia. India is the same and  so\r\n\r\nis Burma. Cambodia and Ceylon are also the same.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This passage was not quoted, but the following words\r\n\r\nwere  quoted - the words which I will now read - by  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No mention was made of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And these are the words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Assembly Interpreter's version in English):\r\n\r\n`South-East Asia is becoming from day to day a peace-loving territory. The Western bloc in Laos and South\r\n\r\nKorea have their puppet governments whose powers are\r\n\r\ngoing  from bad to worse, and they are meeting  with\r\n\r\nmore  and  more difficulties. The West and the  pro-colonialist countries are afraid of and dissatisfied\r\n\r\nwith  the neutral and free people countries who  are\r\n\r\npeace-loving for their influence in this region.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  will give my own translation. I am not very  good\r\n\r\nat   it,  but  this  will  do,  I  think.  It  says,\r\n\r\n`Indonesia is a great force for peace and neutrality\r\n\r\nin  South-East Asia. India is the same; Burma  also,\r\n\r\nCeylon  and  Cambodia.' And the rest  [Interruption]\r\n\r\nAnd  therefore, there was a definite  distortion  in\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Prime Minister has said. And  I  wish  to\r\n\r\ncorrect that distortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second quotation which I would like to bring\r\n\r\nto your notice, Sir, is this, and I wilt read.

Dr\r\n\r\nLee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was telling the House, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the issue is clear and the lesson is also very\r\n\r\ncleat.  The  West Irian issue is part  of  a  global\r\n\r\nstruggle  of  oppressed peoples against colonialism.\r\n\r\nSome  people  seem  to believe that  colonialism  is\r\n\r\nalready  dead. According to the Prime Minister,  the\r\n\r\nback-seat driver is no more there. But we  know  the\r\n\r\nback-seat driver is still there. Colonialism is  not\r\n\r\ndead.  This has been proved by what is happening  in\r\n\r\nAlgeria,  the Cameroons, the Congo, Angola, Northern\r\n\r\nRhodesia,  Kenya, recently Goa and now  West  Irian.\r\n\r\nThe  lesson is that colonialism will not retreat  of\r\n\r\nits  own  accord.  In  order to  gain  our  freedom,\r\n\r\nequality,    justice,   democracy,   progress    and\r\n\r\nprosperity,  we  must keep up a relentless  struggle\r\n\r\nagainst  colonialism. We want a peaceful  settlement\r\n\r\nwhenever possible. In the present West Irian  issue,\r\n\r\nthe  peaceful overtures of the Indonesians have been\r\n\r\nmet   with   force   from  the  intransigent   Dutch\r\n\r\ncolonialists. Under the circumstances, we, like more\r\n\r\nthan  half of the people in the world, and like  the\r\n\r\nUnited Arab Republic and others, wish to express our\r\n\r\nadmiration for the courage and determination of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  people. We call on all in  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Indonesian people in  their  just  and\r\n\r\nlegitimate struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of explanation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, when I\r\n\r\nwas not in this Assembly for the express purpose  of\r\n\r\nnot  interrupting the Member for Queenstown,  I  was\r\n\r\ninformed  that the Member for Choa Chu Kang  alleged\r\n\r\nthat  the draft of the joint statement made  by  Dr\r\n\r\nDjuanda and myself was the work of Mr Woodhull  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Upper Serangoon.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  subsequently  alleged  that  the   draft\r\n\r\nstatement was done by Mr Woodhull and an Indonesian\r\n\r\nofficial and that I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  very  unhappy when I discovered that the  draft\r\n\r\nincludes  West Irian. Mr Speaker, Sir, I  draw  the\r\n\r\nattention  of the House to the fact that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Upper  Serangoon, who is alleged to have  known\r\n\r\nwhat  took place, did not have the temerity  himself\r\n\r\nto say this in this Chamber, but had done so via the\r\n\r\nMember  for Choa Chu Kang who cannot claim  he  knew\r\n\r\nanything about it. All I need say is that I have not\r\n\r\nknown, either the Member for Upper Serangoon or  Mr\r\n\r\nSandra Woodhull to have ever expressed any desire as\r\n\r\nwas stated in the memorandum that there should be  a\r\n\r\npeaceful settlement in the West Irian dispute.  This\r\n\r\nis an utter misrepresentation of what took place.  I\r\n\r\nam  sorry that both the Member for Choa Chu Kang and\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown, who knew nothing of these\r\n\r\nmatters,   have  lent  credence  to   a   completely\r\n\r\nirresponsible falsehood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 40; Noes, Nil; Absent, 6;\r\n\r\nAbstentions, 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Ayes.
