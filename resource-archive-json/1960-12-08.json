In the colonial era  and\r\n\r\nthe era of the Lim Yew Hock Government, there has\r\n\r\nnever  been such a Minister for Finance who could\r\n\r\nhave  given  such a comprehensive and substantial\r\n\r\nanalysis  of the financial and economic situation\r\n\r\nconfronting  the  people of Singapore.  From  the\r\n\r\neconomic  point  of view, had  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  given  us  in his Statement  approximate\r\n\r\nfigures of the profits derived locally by foreign\r\n\r\nenterprises in the past one year, and had he told\r\n\r\nus  what  percentage of their profits  they  were\r\n\r\nprepared  to re-invest locally, then  his  speech\r\n\r\nwould have been more complete, though perhaps  we\r\n\r\nhave no such need. But anyway, we must thank  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance for his  great  effort  in\r\n\r\nhandling the finance and economy of Singapore  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  one year. He has pointed  out  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore the right way of overcoming\r\n\r\nthe  financial and economic difficulties  through\r\n\r\ntheir  own effort. The people can see,  from  his\r\n\r\nreview of the conditions of economy and trade  in\r\n\r\nour  State this year, that in the 1\u00bd  years  of\r\n\r\noffice, the P.A.P. has not only brought about  an\r\n\r\nunprecedented stable political situation but also\r\n\r\na  new situation of increased trade and expansion\r\n\r\nin  production after a short period  of  economic\r\n\r\nstandstill.   Our  Friends  on   the   Opposition\r\n\r\nstrongly put forth their propaganda that when the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. gained power, factories would  be  closed\r\n\r\nand  trade  would  come  to  a  standstill.  This\r\n\r\nphenomenon has not come about at all. Of  course,\r\n\r\nwe  have  no  reason at all to be too  satisfied,\r\n\r\nbecause  the increase in trade and the  expansion\r\n\r\nin  export still cannot raise the living standard\r\n\r\nof   the   workers  and  labourers.  Our  rapidly\r\n\r\nincreasing  population  gives  us  many  problems\r\n\r\nwhich are difficult to settle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think it is necessary to emphasise\r\n\r\nthe   realistic  policy  adopted  by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment in dealing with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  economic  problem. The P.A.P. believe  in  a\r\n\r\nsociety  where there is no exploitation. However,\r\n\r\nwe  will  not  be so blind as to enforce  radical\r\n\r\nsocialistic  and economic measures, because  this\r\n\r\nwill  unnecessarily upset the social and economic\r\n\r\norder  or  structure.  According  to  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  of  the  Minister  for  Finance,   our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme  will   be   carried\r\n\r\nmainly  through  the system of private  and  free\r\n\r\nenterprise.  Thus  honest  capitalists  need  not\r\n\r\nworry  about their capital investments not  being\r\n\r\nprotected by political measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working classes of Singapore, as a whole,\r\n\r\nhave  fully understood the situation in Singapore\r\n\r\nand have expressed their tolerance and wisdom  in\r\n\r\ntheir  struggle  for  better  living  conditions.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year, without their co-operation,\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing industries and trade could not\r\n\r\nhave  expanded. Generally speaking,  the  working\r\n\r\nclasses  are  not  to  be blamed  for  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest under the free enterprise system, except a\r\n\r\nfew  of  them.  In my opinion,  so  long  as  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists  and  employers give their  employees\r\n\r\nreasonable pay and reasonable working conditions,\r\n\r\nthe  workers  of  Singapore will  shoulder  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities to proceed with their production\r\n\r\nwork for the sake of the State's prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debates today and the coming days, our\r\n\r\nfriends  on the Opposition will certainly scratch\r\n\r\ntheir  heads  to think out some minor  points  in\r\n\r\norder  to attack the Government, so as to pretend\r\n\r\nthat  they  are the champions who fight  for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of the people. I maintain that they  are\r\n\r\nall  short-sighted people. No matter how or  what\r\n\r\nthey  say,  even when their lips become  dry  and\r\n\r\ntheir tongues get parched, they will not be  able\r\n\r\nto  show  their talents in order to convince  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Surely they will exaggerate  and  attack\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  saying that it  has  given  the\r\n\r\npeople a burden to shoulder in respect of the tax\r\n\r\nproposals  put forth by the Government.  But,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   the  Minister  for  Finance  has  already\r\n\r\npointed out that in the eight new taxes of $10\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion,  only $750,000 will be directly  derived\r\n\r\nfrom bachelors whose income is less than $310 per\r\n\r\nmonth, or from those families whose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome is less than $500 per month. What is  more\r\n\r\nimportant is that all the revenue from these  new\r\n\r\ntaxes  will  be  completely spent on  the  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  of the people as well as on the economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while reviewing the financial\r\n\r\nconditions of our State, I think it is  necessary\r\n\r\nto   comment  on  several  points.  Firstly,   at\r\n\r\npresent,  the  two  countries - the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  Indonesia, which are inseparable  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  our  State's economy  is  concerned - are\r\n\r\npressing ahead along their own courses they  have\r\n\r\nchosen.  It  is not an easy task to maintain  and\r\n\r\npromote efficiency in the co-operative offices in\r\n\r\nthese    territories    under    these    complex\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  The  efforts  put  forth  by  our\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance in this respect deserve  our\r\n\r\nappreciation. Secondly, up to the present moment,\r\n\r\ncapitalist  countries  have  not  given  us   any\r\n\r\npositive   and  practical  assistance.   In   the\r\n\r\napportionment   of  finances   for   our   future\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plan, our Minister for  Finance  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he  has  no undue  hope  for  foreign\r\n\r\nfinances.  This  is  very  proper  and   correct.\r\n\r\nThirdly,   the   expenditure   of   the   various\r\n\r\ndepartments  in 1960 is less than  the  estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure  by  $37  million.  Naturally  it  is\r\n\r\npartly  due  to the savings in the administrative\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  On the other hand,  it  also  shows\r\n\r\nthat  our  State  lacks highly skilled  technical\r\n\r\npeople.   At  present  the  Government  has   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of recruiting technically  skilled\r\n\r\npeople  either from overseas or locally in  order\r\n\r\nto  fill these vacancies.

The Works Brigade is cheap  labour  at\r\n\r\nbelow  the  market rates for Government projects.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, this is an unhealthy approach to\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of the country and one to  which  the\r\n\r\ntrade unions of the country should awaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> No, Sir, I do not wish any more\r\n\r\ninterruptions.  It is the duty of Government,  as\r\n\r\nan  employer,  not to undermine the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement by a reserve of cheap labour, but to pay\r\n\r\nin full for the services it receives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter on which I must touch is the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the treatment of the civil servants,\r\n\r\nand  the  tender generosity of the Government  in\r\n\r\nstating   that   they   are   willing   to   have\r\n\r\nnegotiations for partial restoration of  variable\r\n\r\nallowances;  or is \"restitution\"  the  word  used\r\n\r\ninstead  of \"restoration\"? I cannot remember.  It\r\n\r\nis a tragic farce that Government should offer to\r\n\r\ngive  the  civil servants a very small percentage\r\n\r\nof  what is their rightful due with one hand, and\r\n\r\nthen  take  it  away in their increased  taxation\r\n\r\nwith the other. And what is more deplorable,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  is that there is in  existence  a\r\n\r\nfreely    negotiated   agreement   between    the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the Civil Service for arbitration\r\n\r\non  pay and conditions of service, and the  civil\r\n\r\nservants   have   pleaded   earnestly   for    an\r\n\r\nArbitration Tribunal to be appointed to  consider\r\n\r\ntheir  legitimate complaints about the manner  of\r\n\r\nthe  reduction of variable allowances  and  about\r\n\r\nthe  need for such reduction in the light of  the\r\n\r\nSurplus Budgets of the P.A.P. Government. Despite\r\n\r\nthe   formal  agreement  freely  negotiated,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment refuse to arbitrate because they state\r\n\r\nthat this is a matter of policy. I am reminded of\r\n\r\nthe  story  of  the  Chinese  cook  in  a  Muslim\r\n\r\nhousehold,  who  was in no uncertain  terms  told\r\n\r\nthat  pork should never be brought to the  house.\r\n\r\nOne  day he was found eating pork. When asked for\r\n\r\nan  explanation,  he said, \"This  no  pork;  this\r\n\r\nfish.  I  put pork in water. I say, `Pork,  pork,\r\n\r\nyou no pork.

In the case of the  Civil\r\n\r\nService  the sum involved is not very great,  but\r\n\r\nthe  number of people involved are a large number\r\n\r\nof  loyal servants of the country. Not only they,\r\n\r\nbut  their dependants, and the trade which  their\r\n\r\nexpenditure brings.

The  newspapers\r\n\r\nhave given the impression that the Government has\r\n\r\npromised to stand-still taxation for three years.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of the Finance Minister's speech\r\n\r\nis that that is only in respect of Property Tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

To put a business  tax  of\r\n\r\n$1,000  on a big limited company would  not  hurt\r\n\r\nthat company.

Yet,  Sir,\r\n\r\nby  his  own calculation, he says that about  $30\r\n\r\nmillion  will  not  be  spent  from  this  year's\r\n\r\nBudget.

In\r\n\r\nother  words,  Sir,  we - I  mean  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore - live on the exertions and  goodwill  of\r\n\r\nour  neighbours.  This state  of  affairs  cannot\r\n\r\ncontinue,  and will not continue for  long.  This\r\n\r\nHouse  is  no  doubt  aware that  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  is making every effort to expand  the\r\n\r\nport  facilities at Port Swettenham and  Sebarang\r\n\r\nPrai;  and  then there is even talk of exploiting\r\n\r\nthe  harbour at Port Dickson, not to mention  the\r\n\r\nproposed  international airport at Kuala  Lumpur.\r\n\r\nNothing,   Sir,   can   induce   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment to stop proceeding with these schemes.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same  time, they are in the  process  of\r\n\r\nestablishing  a rubber and stock exchange  market\r\n\r\nin the Federal capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this hive of activity in the Federation\r\n\r\npoints  to  one  fact. Very  soon,  and  probably\r\n\r\nduring the life-time of this Government, a  large\r\n\r\nportion  of  our  entrepot trade  will  cease  to\r\n\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other support of our\r\n\r\neconomic  life,  Indonesia, has already  shown  a\r\n\r\ntendency  to crack. The Minister for Finance,  in\r\n\r\nhis  Budget  speech, and here, Sir, I quote  from\r\n\r\nHansard, Vol. 14, No. I col. 14, which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Many of the problems arising in our trade with\r\n\r\nIndonesia are long standing and difficult.  While\r\n\r\nwe are a free trade economy with controls reduced\r\n\r\nto  the barest minimum, the Indonesians prefer  a\r\n\r\npolicy  of  \"guided economy\".  This,  in  effect,\r\n\r\nmeans  the imposition of controls over all  major\r\n\r\naspects of trade and production. What we have  to\r\n\r\ndo  is  to  meet  the legitimate requirements  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia's guided economy in such a way  as  not\r\n\r\nto destroy our entrepot trade.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  was what the Minister for Finance  said  in\r\n\r\nhis Budget speech. Whilst on the one hand we must\r\n\r\ngive credit to the Prime Minister for his efforts\r\n\r\nto improve friendly, relations with Indonesia - and\r\n\r\nI admit he has to some extent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  successful - the economic  relations  between\r\n\r\nthe  two  countries  have not shown  any  visible\r\n\r\nsigns  of  improvement. The key to  our  economic\r\n\r\nsurvival is our entrepot trade. This is  not  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time that the Government of Singapore  has\r\n\r\nsent  missions  across the Java sea.  During  the\r\n\r\nDavid  Marshall  regime,  a  similar  Ministerial\r\n\r\nmission  spent  some  time in  Djakarta  followed\r\n\r\nlater   by   two   fact-finding   missions   from\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   Though   there   was   some   slight\r\n\r\nimprovement   in   relations  between   the   two\r\n\r\ncountries, nothing came out of the whole  affair.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, Sir, at that time, there was no  guided\r\n\r\ndemocracy and no guided economy to contend  with.\r\n\r\nAs  I see it. Sir, the basic fact then was, as it\r\n\r\nis  now,  the desire of the Indonesian Government\r\n\r\nto  eliminate what it calls the smuggling  trade.\r\n\r\nSingapore,   being  a  free   port,   places   no\r\n\r\ninsurmountable restrictions on its  imports,  and\r\n\r\nhence  does  not in the nature of things  control\r\n\r\nthe commodities that enter its waters nor enquire\r\n\r\ninto  the sources of the imported goods. In other\r\n\r\nwords, Sir, not all goods imported into the State\r\n\r\nof Singapore from Indonesia have gone through the\r\n\r\nproper  controlling authorities at  the  port  of\r\n\r\nloading.  Hence  what  we call  free  trade,  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  call smuggling. What the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment wanted Singapore to do was to  be  its\r\n\r\npoliceman.  And  this  situation  Singapore   was\r\n\r\nunwilling to accept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only would it create a bad precedent, Sir,\r\n\r\nbut  it  would also upset the whole structure  of\r\n\r\nour free port status. The position today is still\r\n\r\nthe   same,  guided  economy  or  not.   To   the\r\n\r\nIndonesians, it is not only a matter of  national\r\n\r\npride but also a matter of economic survival.  If\r\n\r\nthey  can  manage to seal this  leak  and  a  few\r\n\r\nothers in Borneo and Sarawak, they feel they  can\r\n\r\ncertainly overcome the periodic economic stresses\r\n\r\nthat seem to confront them from time to time.  My\r\n\r\nsympathies, Sir, are with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from this, it could be seen\r\n\r\nthat  the economic survival of Singapore  depends\r\n\r\nlargely on the goodwill and tolerance of our  two\r\n\r\ngreat neighbours, Indonesia and the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  How long we can depend on this goodwill,\r\n\r\nagain only the gods can tell. It is therefore the\r\n\r\nduty  of the Government of Singapore, whether  it\r\n\r\nbe the P.A.P. Government or any other, to provide\r\n\r\nalternative sources of livelihood for its  people\r\n\r\nbefore disaster overtakes them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's Five-Year Plan is an admirable\r\n\r\npaper,   but  what  are  the  basic  facts?   The\r\n\r\nindustries  that  are  envisaged - flour   milling,\r\n\r\ntextile  weaving, steel milling  and  a  host  of\r\n\r\nother   manufacturing  projects -  will  no  doubt\r\n\r\nprovide  employment  to many.  But,  Sir,  having\r\n\r\nproduced  such  goods, the job is to  sell  them.\r\n\r\nUnless   we   can   produce  cheaply   and   sell\r\n\r\ncompetitively I see no hope for an industrialised\r\n\r\nSingapore,  however hard Government  may  try  to\r\n\r\ninduce investors to set up industries. We are not\r\n\r\nthe  only  country in Asia which is  thinking  in\r\n\r\nterms of industrialisation. And we are not in the\r\n\r\nfortunate  position which some of these countries\r\n\r\nare  in,  where they have a huge local population\r\n\r\nwho  can  easily consume the products that  their\r\n\r\nindustries   produce  without   bothering   about\r\n\r\nexports.   As   I   see  it,  Sir,   Government's\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  policy,  among  other  things,\r\n\r\nfaces  two uncompromising barriers. The first  is\r\n\r\nthe  lack of a ready and large enough home market\r\n\r\nto   act  as  a  cushion  and  to  make  industry\r\n\r\nworthwhile;  and, secondly, the  tariff  barriers\r\n\r\nthat  have been and will ultimately be put up  by\r\n\r\nother   producing  countries,  as   has   already\r\n\r\nhappened in Indonesia and only a few days ago  in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  of  Malaya.  Both   these   two\r\n\r\ncountries  which  are  our  logical  buyers   and\r\n\r\nconsumers  have  their own  Five-Year  Plans  and\r\n\r\nindustrial  policies; hence we cannot  place  any\r\n\r\nconfidence  in these markets. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nSir,  we cannot hope to follow the lead taken  by\r\n\r\nHongkong,  where primarily because of  its  very,\r\n\r\nvery  cheap  labour it has been able  to  capture\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  world's markets.  It  is  obvious,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  by the time our  industries  go\r\n\r\ninto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfull  gear  most  of  the  possible  markets  now\r\n\r\navailable to us will have already been  taken  up\r\n\r\nby   the  local  industries  in  the  territories\r\n\r\nconcerned, or will have been checked one  way  or\r\n\r\nanother by tariff barriers. Sir, I do not dare to\r\n\r\npredict  that Government's industrial  plan  will\r\n\r\nend in failure. But I do say this - that so long as\r\n\r\nour  economy  is tied in the way  it  is  to  the\r\n\r\ngoodwill  of  our neighbours, the  way  ahead  is\r\n\r\nindeed  bleak  and dark. I therefore  hope,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  while  implementing  its  industrial  plan,\r\n\r\nGovernment  would at the same time  make  greater\r\n\r\nefforts  to convince our neighbours, particularly\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya, that they need  us  as\r\n\r\nmuch as we need them. The only way to do this  is\r\n\r\nto  put  the general political atmosphere in  its\r\n\r\nproper perspective. Our Prime Minister here, Sir,\r\n\r\nproclaims  that  his  Government  is  a   Leftist\r\n\r\nSocialist  Government.  Across  the  Straits   of\r\n\r\nJohore,  we find the Tunku vociferously repeating\r\n\r\nthat  his  is  a  Rightist  people's  government.\r\n\r\nWhilst, on the one hand, the people of both these\r\n\r\nterritories   tend   to  regard   themselves   as\r\n\r\nMalayans, the Government of both territories  are\r\n\r\npoles  apart.  Somewhere, Sir, there  must  be  a\r\n\r\nlink, a link that would strike the right note and\r\n\r\nbring  about  a  common  understanding  of   each\r\n\r\nother's  problems.  For only then  can  there  be\r\n\r\nmutual  trust and mutual respect, the foundations\r\n\r\nupon which to build a prosperous Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we are on the subject of our\r\n\r\nrelations  with  the Federation,  I  am  somewhat\r\n\r\nperturbed to note that it is the intention of the\r\n\r\nGovernment   eventually   to   have    a    trade\r\n\r\nrepresentative in Kuala Lumpur. I wonder  whether\r\n\r\nthis  is  a wise move. If the object is  to  have\r\n\r\ncloser  relations  with  the  Federation  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic field, then I think it is the wrong  way\r\n\r\nto  go  about it. Kuala Lumpur is only 200  miles\r\n\r\naway,  a  matter  of only an hour's  flight  from\r\n\r\nSingapore. Nothing would jeopardize the relations\r\n\r\nbetween these two countries more than to  have  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  in  Kuala Lumpur,  a  fact  which\r\n\r\nwould  only  tend  to emphasise  the  distinction\r\n\r\nrather than the common interests of both. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  advise Government to think again  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlast  year  we  humbly and earnestly  warned  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that their policy of the big knife and\r\n\r\nthe big axe-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The broad axe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - and the broad axe was being\r\n\r\ncarried out too far; that the drastic cut in  the\r\n\r\nvariable allowances of Government servants was  a\r\n\r\nhasty   and   premature  step  and  might   prove\r\n\r\nunnecessary because the threatened deficit  might\r\n\r\nturn  out  to  be a surplus. As usual,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\narguments of the Opposition were met by a barrage\r\n\r\nof  ridicule sneers and laughter. We also  warned\r\n\r\nthe Government that the drastic reduction in the\r\n\r\nspending   power  of  thousands   of   Government\r\n\r\nemployees  to  the  tune of millions  of  dollars\r\n\r\nwould  have a chain reaction and that there would\r\n\r\nbe  repercussions on the economy of the  country.\r\n\r\nSir,  after  14  years, the  truth  is  out.  Our\r\n\r\nforecasts  were correct. The year 1959 ended  not\r\n\r\nwith  a deficit but with a surplus of $9 million,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the speech of the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara, and the year 1960 is likely to end with a\r\n\r\ndeficit of $37 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> A surplus!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> With a surplus of $37\r\n\r\nmillion.  Ordinarily, Sir,  surpluses  should  be\r\n\r\nwelcomed.  But  these surpluses as  a  result  of\r\n\r\ndrastic  under-expenditure and drastic  pay  cuts\r\n\r\nhave  had  very adverse effects on the  country's\r\n\r\neconomy.  The  result is that there  has  been  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  tightening  up  of  the  people's  purse\r\n\r\nstrings.  People who have money are reluctant  to\r\n\r\nspend, and those who would like to spend have not\r\n\r\ngot  the money or have not got jobs' whereby they\r\n\r\ncan earn money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister has mentioned two\r\n\r\naspects which are considered remarkable.  In  the\r\n\r\nlight  of  what I have said, Sir, the explanation\r\n\r\nis  quite  simple. May I refer to  Hansard,  29th\r\n\r\nNovember,  1960, Vol. 14, No. 1,  col.  18  which\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All in all, the indications are that there was\r\n\r\na  solid  and substantial revival of the  economy\r\n\r\nthis  year.  What is remarkable in this  economic\r\n\r\nrevival  is  that  the  expansion  in  trade  and\r\n\r\nproduction  did not bring about any  inflationary\r\n\r\nprocess.  The  currency in  circulation  for  the\r\n\r\nMalayan    dollar   area   remained   practically\r\n\r\nstationary,  being $1,162 million in January  and\r\n\r\n$1,166 million in September.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, we know now why. Because there was\r\n\r\nnot  much  money  in  circulation  owing  to  the\r\n\r\ndrastic cut in the millions that could have  been\r\n\r\nspent   and  that  could  have  started  a  chain\r\n\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Prices of consumer goods did not rise.

The fact that the Indonesian  trade\r\n\r\ndeclined was another sign. I shall later on  deal\r\n\r\nwith  what  I consider to be the real reason  for\r\n\r\nthe  surpluses.

If  the\r\n\r\ncut   in   the  variable  allowances   was   made\r\n\r\nunilaterally,  on the basis of  a  wrong  premise\r\n\r\nthat there would be a huge deficit, then whatever\r\n\r\nthe  Government gained thereby should  belong  to\r\n\r\nthe  employees.  If there should be  negotiations\r\n\r\nfor  a  partial restoration of that cut, then  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  made hereafter but it could  not  have\r\n\r\nretrospective effect. What was cut  off  was  cut\r\n\r\noff  on  the  assumption that the Government  was\r\n\r\nfacing  a  huge  deficit. That  deficit  did  not\r\n\r\nmaterialise  because,  as  a  result  of  \r\n\r\nunder-expenditure,  there  was no  deficit.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nSir,  part  of  that  surplus  belonged  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  employees. Sir, it is  time  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to show by their actions that they are\r\n\r\na  model  employer. If an employer,  on  a  wrong\r\n\r\npremise, retained part of his employee's pay  and\r\n\r\nin  due  course he finds out that he had  made  a\r\n\r\nmistake, then I am sure, Sir, that the Government\r\n\r\nwould demand that that employer should return all\r\n\r\nthe money that had been wrongly retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

However,  it  is\r\n\r\npossible that in the process of negotiations, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  might be able to persuade  the  Staff\r\n\r\nSide,  out  of  loyalty to the State  or  out  of\r\n\r\nsympathy   for   the  unemployed,   to   make   a\r\n\r\ncontribution to an unemployment fund;  but  I  am\r\n\r\nsure that morally the civil servants are entitled\r\n\r\nto  that sum of money which has been retained  on\r\n\r\nwrong premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the first quarter of his Budget\r\n\r\nStatement, the Minister for Finance launched  out\r\n\r\non  what he described as \"a dissertation on basic\r\n\r\nprinciples\".  There is much in that statement  of\r\n\r\nprinciples with which we agree, but now and  then\r\n\r\nhe varied cleverly, interposing a sparkling claim\r\n\r\nwhich  might impress foreign readers  or  passing\r\n\r\ntourists  but  which is startling and  in  a  way\r\n\r\nsurprising to local people with local knowledge.\r\n\r\nSuch   claims   cannot   be   allowed   to   pass\r\n\r\nunchallenged.   In  column  10  of   the   Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  at  paragraph  2,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This is the ultimate test.

Then he went on\r\n\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By this standard the people of Singapore have\r\n\r\ndone well.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"Have  done  well\", Sir?

If the Government had said that\r\n\r\nsome  of the people of Singapore have done  well,\r\n\r\nwe  could  have accepted that. The  people  would\r\n\r\nhave  accepted that without any protest.  But  to\r\n\r\nsay  that the people of Singapore have done  well\r\n\r\nthroughout  last year, Sir - that is  like  asking\r\n\r\npeople to believe what they have not experienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people who have eyes to see and ears to\r\n\r\nhear  can  see and hear for themselves  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened.  The  people who have benefited  are  a\r\n\r\nsmall section of the community - the merchants  who\r\n\r\nhave  trading interests with the Federation.  The\r\n\r\nmerchants  and  companies who own tin  mines  and\r\n\r\nrubber  estates or who own shares have benefited.\r\n\r\nThe  increases  have only been increases  through\r\n\r\nbank  transfers, but the profits  have  not  gone\r\n\r\nquickly  to  the  employees and then  on  to  the\r\n\r\nconsumers.   Therefore,   there   is   not   much\r\n\r\nmoney - more  than  what  is usually  circulated - to\r\n\r\ncirculate. There is less spending power. With the\r\n\r\npopulation  increasing, naturally there  is  less\r\n\r\nmoney per head to spend. Sir, those who have made\r\n\r\nmoney  and  who have really prospered  have  most\r\n\r\nprobably salted it away somewhere - [Interruption]\r\n\r\nmaybe  to  the Federation, Borneo or  Sarawak - and\r\n\r\nthey will not invest in Singapore until they  see\r\n\r\nmore   signs  to  indicate  that  they  can  have\r\n\r\nconfidence  in the Government. One way  in  which\r\n\r\nthe  Government can show that they  are  able  to\r\n\r\nkeep their promises is for them as employers, -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Who is talking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> -to do what they expect other\r\n\r\nemployers to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What is that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But  can  the  Government  really\r\n\r\nsucceed if with one hand they promise to give one\r\n\r\nthing,  and  with the other hand they  cause  the\r\n\r\npeople's  confidence to be shakened? To give  one\r\n\r\ninstance,  Sir, there is in the trade unions,  as\r\n\r\nwe  know,  a struggle for control. The Government\r\n\r\nside  know  better than we, Sir, what forces  are\r\n\r\ninvolved.  But the general workers  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  not interested in the political struggle  in\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions. They are only  interested  in\r\n\r\nbetter wages and better living conditions, and if\r\n\r\nthey  could  share  in  the prosperity  of  their\r\n\r\nemployers, they would be glad to do so. They  are\r\n\r\nnot  interested in the political struggle, except\r\n\r\nthose who are interested in political power. Sir,\r\n\r\nif  the trade unions in Singapore could be really\r\n\r\nset   free,   like  the  trade  unions   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation,   that  would  be  a   step   towards\r\n\r\nindustrial peace and stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government have declared that they are\r\n\r\npartial  to  the workers. If they want stability,\r\n\r\nthen  they will have to be partial, fair or  just\r\n\r\nto  three sides: to the workers, to the employers\r\n\r\nand  to  the  general  public.  Very  often,  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public are left out from  that  picture.\r\n\r\nHow  can people believe that politics do not play\r\n\r\nan  important  part  in  trade  unions  and  that\r\n\r\npolitics  do not have a final say in business  if\r\n\r\nthe  Government  still have  political  advisers?\r\n\r\nWith   political  advisers  advising   Government\r\n\r\nMinisters  and playing a very prominent  part  in\r\n\r\ntrade  unions, it must naturally be assumed  that\r\n\r\nshould  there be any disagreement, then there  is\r\n\r\nno chance for the business people to have justice\r\n\r\non  their  side.  So  if the Government  want  to\r\n\r\nindicate  that  they are sincere  in  wanting  to\r\n\r\nbring  over foreign capital and in getting  local\r\n\r\npeople  interested in investing  money  in  local\r\n\r\nenterprises, then one way would be to abolish the\r\n\r\nposts of Political Secretaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nreferred  to Japan and West Germany as  countries\r\n\r\nwhose economic revival has been nothing short  of\r\n\r\nmiraculous.   Sir,   these  countries   are   not\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by  extreme Left-wing  groups.  I  am\r\n\r\nglad,  Sir,  that the Government  say  that  free\r\n\r\nenterprise  can  play a great  part  in  bringing\r\n\r\nprosperity to the country. We believe, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nany  industrial peace based on the ideology of  a\r\n\r\nclass  war  will never work. It is time  that  we\r\n\r\nthink  about the basis on which we want  to  have\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace and stability in this  country.\r\n\r\nWe  should not set workers against employers  nor\r\n\r\nemployers   against  workers.  We   are   against\r\n\r\nexploitation of the workers by employers. But the\r\n\r\ntime  has  come  when  we cannot  have  political\r\n\r\nbosses  also exploiting the workers for the  sake\r\n\r\nof political power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of unemployment casts a shadow\r\n\r\nover  the  future  of Singapore.

At\r\n\r\nthat rate, Sir, Government will need $800 million\r\n\r\nto provide employment for 20,000 workers, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  be  the  annual intake of  labour  into  the\r\n\r\nlabour  market each year.

Since  June  1959,\r\n\r\nthis  Government has introduced 12 new taxes.  In\r\n\r\nthe  1961  Budget  these  12  new  taxes  in   my\r\n\r\nestimation will yield approximately $45  million.\r\n\r\nMost of these millions will be squeezed, cent  by\r\n\r\ncent,  dollar by dollar, from the poor, from  the\r\n\r\nwage earners, from the shopkeepers, from the \r\n\r\ntaxi-drivers   and  the  hawkers,  from  the   working\r\n\r\npopulation, from the small private companies  run\r\n\r\nby  local merchants. An estimated $100,000 out of\r\n\r\nthe  $45  million  is all the  contribution  this\r\n\r\nGovernment has asked from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbig  European firms which control our economy and\r\n\r\nmake most of the profits.

The 12 new taxes introduced\r\n\r\nby  this so-called socialist Government and their\r\n\r\nrespective  revenue  in  1961  are  estimated  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              Million\r\n\r\n                                                 $\r\n\r\n            1  Tax on local made                8.0\r\n\r\n               cigarettes \r\n\r\n               \r\n\r\n            2  Tax on petrol                    6.0\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n        On  these two taxes, when they were  \r\n\r\n        introduced in  September 1959, it was  \r\n\r\n        expected that they  would yield about  \r\n\r\n        $14 million.

Who are the people affected? Are\r\n\r\nthese taxes just and equitable? Are they based on\r\n\r\nthe  principle of \"ability to pay\",  a  principle\r\n\r\nrecognised  and adopted even by openly  confessed\r\n\r\nRight-wing  capitalist Governments?  And  we  ask\r\n\r\nourselves: is this a Government working  for  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people? Sir, what is  the  real\r\n\r\nnature of these new taxes? I shall describe  them\r\n\r\nbriefly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, tax on local made cigarettes. This tax\r\n\r\nwas  introduced  on 17th September,  1959,  after\r\n\r\nmonths  of disagreement between the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand myself. This tax has two effects. It is a tax\r\n\r\non  the poor. The worker and the wage earner  are\r\n\r\nthose  who smoke local-made cigarettes. This  tax\r\n\r\nalso suppressed local cigarette manufacturers for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  the  big American  and  British\r\n\r\ncigarette  monopolies. A worker or a wage  earner\r\n\r\nwho smokes, say, 20 cigarettes a day will have to\r\n\r\npay  an  additional tax of $6  a  month.  I  have\r\n\r\ncorrespondence between the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nand myself on this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what is the impact and incidence of the\r\n\r\npetrol  tax?  Out  of  an  estimated  $6  million\r\n\r\nadditional  revenue  a year from  petrol  tax,  I\r\n\r\nestimated $2 million will come from taxi drivers,\r\n\r\npirate  taxis, lorry operators and fishermen;  $2\r\n\r\nmillion from wage earners, teachers and salesmen;\r\n\r\n$1\u00bd  million  from shopkeepers, and  less  than\r\n\r\n$1\u00bd  million  from those who  can  afford  cars\r\n\r\nworth  more than $12,000 each. The petrol tax  is\r\n\r\nprimarily a tax on taxi drivers, the white collar\r\n\r\nworkers and the small shopkeepers. This tax  will\r\n\r\nbe  an  intolerable burden on taxi  drivers.  The\r\n\r\nplans  we  have finalised with the Taxi  Drivers'\r\n\r\nUnion  to  give coupons to the taxi  drivers  was\r\n\r\nvetoed.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, at  the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nsitting, I wish to put on record in this House  a\r\n\r\ncopy  of the plan for a Petrol Coupon Scheme  for\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we come to the lotteries tax. What is the\r\n\r\nincidence  of  the  lotteries tax?  How  does  it\r\n\r\noperate?  The  lotteries tax  is  a  tax  on  the\r\n\r\nunderprivileged  sections of the  population  who\r\n\r\nhoped  to  change their fortunes, and  have  been\r\n\r\nencouraged by this so-called socialist Government\r\n\r\nto  do  so, especially the hawkers, taxi drivers,\r\n\r\nwage  earners and all those in debt. Out of every\r\n\r\ndollar \"invested\" in lotteries, 30 per cent  goes\r\n\r\nto the Government as tax. 40 per cent goes to the\r\n\r\nSingapore Turf Club and the horse owners, and  30\r\n\r\nper cent goes back to the purchasers of lotteries\r\n\r\nas  prizes. The lotteries tax introduced by  this\r\n\r\nGovernment is to raise revenue from the poor  and\r\n\r\nto benefit the European and Compradore controlled\r\n\r\nSingapore  Turf  Club and the  millionaire  horse\r\n\r\nowners,  unlike  the  Federation  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nlottery which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis a tax on the poor for the benefit of the poor.\r\n\r\nOurs  is  not so. The peculiar characteristic  of\r\n\r\nthe  lotteries  tax  is  that,  with  increasing\r\n\r\nunemployment  and  bad  business  conditions,  an\r\n\r\nincreasing  number  of  people  who  hardly  earn\r\n\r\nenough  to eat, the collection from the lotteries\r\n\r\ntax  will  increase.  The  Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nsounded  very  happy when he  said  this  in  his Budget Speech (col. 29):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As against an estimate of $4 million on taxes\r\n\r\non  totalisators and sweepstakes [in  1960],  the\r\n\r\nactual  collections  for  the  first  ten  months\r\n\r\namounted  to  $4.7 million and, it is anticipated\r\n\r\nthat  the  original estimate will be exceeded  by\r\n\r\n$1.2 million by the end of the year.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>On the other hand, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Stamp duty was estimated at $3.8 million but\r\n\r\nthere  is  likely  to  be  a  shortfall  of  $\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a very great example of\r\n\r\nbusiness conditions and the state of the  economy\r\n\r\nof our country. This decrease in collections from\r\n\r\nstamp duty means that the volume of business  and\r\n\r\nproperty transactions has decreased. More revenue\r\n\r\nfrom   the  lotteries  tax  than  expected,  less\r\n\r\nrevenue from stamp duty than expected - nothing  is\r\n\r\na  better indication that times are bad. But, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  to  Mr Ah Q,  however,  this  is\r\n\r\n\"prosperity\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we come to the pay cuts. Ex-civil\r\n\r\nservants hate civil servants. Ex-professional men\r\n\r\ndislike professional men. Is it not true that the\r\n\r\noriginal plan hatched by ex-civil servants to tax\r\n\r\nformer colleagues was even more severe? Not  many\r\n\r\ndays after the issue of the Hong Lim resolutions,\r\n\r\nthe   Prime  Minister  despatched  his  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary, Mr Jek Yuen Thong, to Cairnhill where\r\n\r\ncivil servants were told that their pay cuts were\r\n\r\nthe  result  of that scapegoat, Ong Eng  Guan.  I\r\n\r\nchallenge the Minister for Finance, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  tell the truth about the pay  cuts  and\r\n\r\ntell them what was his original plan.

I\r\n\r\nremember   in  1959  the  Minister  for   Finance\r\n\r\ntransferred  Mr  Rajendra,  who  works  in   the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department, from  Hill  Street\r\n\r\nto  Jurong  without  my  knowledge,  when  I  was\r\n\r\nMinister  in  charge  of  the  Telecommunications\r\n\r\nDepartment and was responsible for any  breakdown\r\n\r\nin  the  service. Mr Speaker, Sir, I  never  did\r\n\r\nthat to all those members of the Staff Unions  in\r\n\r\nCity Council times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present political strategy of the Government\r\n\r\nis  this.  Hang a carrot in front  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  but let them bite it some time  later,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the period of negotiations,  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  decided by the interplay  of  political\r\n\r\nforces.   The   Government   will   engage   more\r\n\r\nexpatriates; it is considered local engineers and\r\n\r\narchitects cannot do the job. The Government will\r\n\r\nseek  more funds from the United Kingdom and  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States - build and build, spend and  spend,\r\n\r\nno  matter  whether  such  construction  or  such\r\n\r\nexpenditure is to the interests of the people  or\r\n\r\nnot,  for it can be left to posterity to pay  the\r\n\r\nforeign  debts.  By  1962, anti-colonial  slogans\r\n\r\nwould   be   slowly   but  surely   reintroduced.\r\n\r\nEventually  it  hopes to spring a  snap  election\r\n\r\nbefore  1964,  perhaps in 1963 if conditions  are\r\n\r\nfavourable.  This is considered by the  political\r\n\r\nstrategists  to  be the only chance  left  to  be\r\n\r\nreturned  a  second time, and the civil  servants\r\n\r\nwould  be given partial restoration of their  pay\r\n\r\ncuts  to  make them play a more decisive role  to\r\n\r\nsave them. Mr Speaker, Sir, the legislation  for\r\n\r\nsnap elections was passed last year. The Press is\r\n\r\nnow  rigidly  controlled. Special articles  under\r\n\r\npseudonyms   supplied  by  Government   regularly\r\n\r\nappear  in the Chinese papers whenever there  are\r\n\r\nhot  political issues. The radio is fast becoming\r\n\r\na  Party  radio; television will  also  become  a\r\n\r\nParty television. Expensive pamphlets printed  on\r\n\r\ngloss  paper from public funds with high-sounding\r\n\r\ntitles   like   \"The  Socialist  Solution\",   \"An\r\n\r\nAnalysis   of   Current   Political   Forces   in\r\n\r\nSingapore\", and \"Towards Socialism\",  Vol.  1,  a\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture Publication; 30,000 to 40,000\r\n\r\ncopies  had  been scattered and nobody  wants  to\r\n\r\nread  them.  It begins with the Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nspeech  made  in  this Assembly. These  pamphlets\r\n\r\nwith  high-sounding titles but containing nothing\r\n\r\nconcerning  socialism, more will be  printed  and\r\n\r\nthrown around. And despite this rigid control  of\r\n\r\nthe  Press,  and  the threats of  laws  like  the\r\n\r\nCriminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, in\r\n\r\ncase some people who do not toe the Lee Kuan  Yew\r\n\r\nline still start distributing pamphlets like  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim, the Member for Aljunied  and\r\n\r\nthe Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPunggol  once  used  to do, there  would  be  the\r\n\r\nlatest  amendment to the Undesirable Publications\r\n\r\nOrdinance on the 17th November, 1960, which would\r\n\r\nenable  the  Government  to  raid  premises   and\r\n\r\nimpound  such pamphlets. I knew on that day.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  but  would all these  suppressive\r\n\r\nmeasures  work? Would all these gadgets ensure  a\r\n\r\nreturn  to  power in 1964? The former  Government\r\n\r\nalso  tried  many  gadgets. For instance,  George\r\n\r\nThomson  went to New Zealand to study  compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting.  But  it did not succeed. Any  government\r\n\r\nwhich   works  sincerely  and  honestly   without\r\n\r\nresorting to electioneering and political gadgets\r\n\r\nwill be returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the taxes I have described\r\n\r\njust   now,  the  cigarettes  tax,  petrol   tax,\r\n\r\nlotteries  tax  and  the  pay  cuts  which   were\r\n\r\nintroduced in 1959 and 1960, would continue to be\r\n\r\ncollected in 1961. We now come to the other eight\r\n\r\nnew taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the income tax. Among the eight\r\n\r\nnew taxes, the decrease in the rates for personal\r\n\r\nallowances  is the most important. $4 million  is\r\n\r\nexpected  from this new tax. This is a tax  aimed\r\n\r\nmainly  at  the lower income groups, particularly\r\n\r\nthe  wage-earners and the shopkeepers. Due to the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  personal  allowances,  the  middle\r\n\r\nclass will also be slightly affected by having to\r\n\r\npay  higher  rates. The increase of  the  maximum\r\n\r\nrate  to 55 per cent on incomes above $100,000  a\r\n\r\nyear is a propaganda eye-wash, to give people  an\r\n\r\nimpression  that  the  1961  change  in  the  tax\r\n\r\nstructure is directed not only towards the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  groups. This 5 per cent increase  on  the\r\n\r\nover   $100,000  income  group  attracts   little\r\n\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nhaving  difficulty in reading the speech  because\r\n\r\nof the lighting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That matter has been raised as a\r\n\r\npoint  of information.

This 5  per\r\n\r\ncent  increase  on those with more than  $100,000\r\n\r\nattracts  little  revenue.  There  are  only  118\r\n\r\npeople  in this income group as contained in  the\r\n\r\nIncome Tax 1958 Annual Report. The Federation  is\r\n\r\nagain as usual being used as a convenient excuse.\r\n\r\nFor  several  years there have  been  differences\r\n\r\nbetween our respective tax laws, the tax base and\r\n\r\nthe  tax rates in the two territories. Very  soon\r\n\r\nthere are to be two different currencies, whether\r\n\r\nwe  like it or not. People are tired and  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  in the Federation scapegoat for all  the\r\n\r\nacts  of  commission and omission  done  by  this\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Federation had years ago repealed\r\n\r\nthe  Business  Registration Tax due  to  protests\r\n\r\nfrom  the  shopkeepers. Why should Singapore  now\r\n\r\nintroduce  this tax? Why does Singapore  want  to\r\n\r\nintroduce a tax rejected by the Federation? It is\r\n\r\ncommon knowledge that the shopkeepers tax,  which\r\n\r\nis  the  real  word for the Business Registration\r\n\r\nTax,  was  the  main form of tax used  mainly  by\r\n\r\ncolonial  countries  like  Sarawak  and  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation   before  Merdeka   to   benefit   the\r\n\r\ninterests of the big foreign companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by reducing the personal\r\n\r\nallowances the Government also hopes to  draw  an\r\n\r\nestimated 20,000 people into the Income Tax  net.\r\n\r\nIt  expects to collect $750,000 from these 20,000\r\n\r\nnew    taxpayers,   mostly   wage-earners.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  estimates  it  will  collect  on   an\r\n\r\naverage of about $36 from each new taxpayer.

The Business Registration  Tax\r\n\r\nis  actually the shopkeepers' tax. It is proposed\r\n\r\nto  raise $2\u00bd million in 1961 from this tax. If\r\n\r\nall  shops  and  businesses are taxed  equitably,\r\n\r\nthen there is nothing so objectionable about  the\r\n\r\nBusiness  Registration Tax. But this is  not  the\r\n\r\ncase.  Public limited companies, owned mostly  by\r\n\r\nEuropean enterprises possessing on the average  a\r\n\r\ncapital of $20 to $30 million each and earning on\r\n\r\nthe  average  millions of dollars  of  profits  a\r\n\r\nyear,  are  only asked to pay an  annual  tax  of\r\n\r\n$1,000.  For instance, the Hongkong and  Shanghai\r\n\r\nBank,  with a capital of $120 million and earning\r\n\r\na  profit  of  $14 million a year,  pays  $1,000.\r\n\r\nPrivate   companies,  owned   mostly   by   local\r\n\r\nbusinessmen,  some  of  which  have  only  a  few\r\n\r\nthousand  dollars capital, pay $750 a  year.

But neither are the private companies.\r\n\r\nShopkeepers are asked to pay $50 or $100 for sole\r\n\r\nownership and partnership respectively. The  shop\r\n\r\ncould be a small coffeeshop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson):</b> On a\r\n\r\npoint of order, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since we\r\n\r\nunderstand  that you have ruled  before  that  no\r\n\r\nMember  can read from a text, it seems  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong Lim throughout his  speech  has\r\n\r\nbeen reading from his text.

The Chair's ruling is very simple, that a\r\n\r\nMember   should  not  refer  to  his  notes   too\r\n\r\nfrequently  unless, of course, there are  volumes\r\n\r\nof  figures that he wishes to quote from.

The shop could be a  small  coffee\r\n\r\nshop  with a few hundred dollars capital. In this\r\n\r\nmanner,  the  Business  Registration  Tax  is  an\r\n\r\nunjust tax, throwing a heavy burden on the  small\r\n\r\nand medium sized shopkeepers. We propose that the\r\n\r\n$2  million expected from the business tax should\r\n\r\nnot  be  borne  mainly  by the  shopkeepers,  but\r\n\r\nshould  be  spread out proportionately among  all\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  big  or  small, European  or  local,\r\n\r\naccording  to  capital. The Government  must  not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate against small shopkeepers and  small\r\n\r\nprivate  companies in favour of the big  European\r\n\r\nfirms.  Those shops and private companies with  a\r\n\r\ncapital of under $10,000 or so should be exempted\r\n\r\nfrom  this tax. Otherwise small shops and private\r\n\r\ncompanies with less than $10,000 capital might be\r\n\r\ncompelled to close down.

Shopkeepers are not capitalists.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister for Finance said in his  speech  at\r\n\r\ncolumn 44:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The reason for introducing this form of\r\n\r\ntaxation  is apparent. A large majority of  small\r\n\r\nshopkeepers do not contribute whatsoever  to  the\r\n\r\nInland Revenue.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these small shopkeepers were\r\n\r\nnot paying income tax because many of them do not\r\n\r\nearn one-tenth of the income of our Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries.  That  is, they  do  not  even  make\r\n\r\n$2,000  a  year. The shopkeepers are, in general,\r\n\r\npeople   who  have  started  from  the   humblest\r\n\r\norigins,  through self denial and hard work,  and\r\n\r\nsometimes  with the help of friends and relatives\r\n\r\nthey  manage  to open a shop either alone  or  in\r\n\r\npartnership.  They  are  now  singled   out   for\r\n\r\ncriticism  by the Minister for Finance for  their\r\n\r\nabstemious habits. Were it not for the fact  that\r\n\r\ngenerations  of them had sweated and  toiled  and\r\n\r\nexercised  self-denial  and  were  of  abstemious\r\n\r\nhabits,  would there have been built  the  public\r\n\r\ninstitutions  and the schools and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nthat we see today?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the other new taxes, the tax on private\r\n\r\nlotteries yields a meagre $100,000. Why look into\r\n\r\nthe  haystack for such a small needle? A few free\r\n\r\noverseas  trips would cost that amount. The  only\r\n\r\nconclusion  I  can  draw is  that  certain  small\r\n\r\norganisations,  which occasionally  sell  private\r\n\r\nlotteries  for  charities or to  boost  up  their\r\n\r\nfunds, are hurting the sales of the lotteries  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Turf Club. Lumped  together  with\r\n\r\nthis tax on private lotteries is the tax on\r\n\r\njackpots. And, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimagine  how much tax is to be raised from \r\n\r\njackpots.  $50,000! Just sufficient to  beautify  Sri\r\n\r\nTemasek  with marble. The purpose of this jackpot\r\n\r\ntax  is  to conceal the motive behind the private\r\n\r\nlotteries  tax  by  the  familiar  technique   of\r\n\r\nlumping together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new tax proposal is to raise the\r\n\r\nassessment of properties in the rural areas.  Why\r\n\r\nnot  assess those beautiful Shell properties  and\r\n\r\nbungalows  in Pulau Bukom which should  yield  at\r\n\r\nleast  a million dollars a year? The poor  Malays\r\n\r\nin the Southern Islands have to pay assessment on\r\n\r\ntheir  shabby  attap huts. The Shell  Company  in\r\n\r\nPulau  Bukom do not have to observe building  and\r\n\r\nplanning by-laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S.

The\r\n\r\nShell  properties in Pulau Bukom are worth  about\r\n\r\n$125  million. They do not pay even one  cent  of\r\n\r\nassessment.  Does the Prime Minister  know  this,\r\n\r\ndespite  the fact that this matter is  under  his\r\n\r\ncharge?   That   is   the  reason   why   certain\r\n\r\ndepartments  have had to be taken over  from  his\r\n\r\nformer  Minister for National Development. Again,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, why not open negotiations with\r\n\r\nthe  British on assessment of houses on  military\r\n\r\nproperties? This will probably yield millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars annually. After all, the British Military\r\n\r\nand   the  Shell  Company  are  benefiting   from\r\n\r\nservices provided by the City Council in the form\r\n\r\nof  health measures, roads, public utilities  and\r\n\r\nso  on. We are only asking them to pay their fair\r\n\r\nshare, and nothing more. The proposed increase in\r\n\r\nassessment on rural properties will affect mainly\r\n\r\nthe farmers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the rural shopkeepers. There have been little\r\n\r\nsignificant  improvements  in  the  rural  areas.\r\n\r\nRural  poverty,  farmers  heavily  in  debt,  and\r\n\r\nsqualid  living conditions. The farmers  are  now\r\n\r\nsuffering,  due  to the reduction  of  prices  of\r\n\r\npigs,  eggs, chickens and vegetables. The general\r\n\r\npoverty  of  the  farmers has also  affected  the\r\n\r\nrural  shopkeepers. The least the Government  can\r\n\r\ndo  is  to  leave them alone. Has the  Government\r\n\r\nreally  the  heart to increase their  taxes?  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance described the jackpot  as  a\r\n\r\none-armed bandit. It is not as oppressive as  the\r\n\r\ntwo-armed  bandit,  who searches  anxiously  with\r\n\r\nhungry looking eyes for the poor as his prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it is expected to raise $500,000 from\r\n\r\nimposing  a  stamp  duty  on  import  and  export\r\n\r\ndeclarations.  I  agree  with  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance that this will not impose a burden on the\r\n\r\nimporters and exporters. However, is it necessary\r\n\r\nin the interests of Singapore's trade? The charge\r\n\r\nis  small but it has a nuisance value. This stamp\r\n\r\nduty  will  hinder the smooth and quick  flow  of\r\n\r\ntrade.  There will be more queues. The Department\r\n\r\nhas to stamp 3,000 forms each day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is it necessary to introduce\r\n\r\nall  these taxes to raise $45 million? I am  sure\r\n\r\nthere are many more soak-the-poor gimmicks in the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance's bag. In my opinion,  all\r\n\r\nthese are not necessary. The Government can prune\r\n\r\ndown  its  wasteful and extravagant  expenditure,\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministers  themselves  should  set   an\r\n\r\nexample like leaders in other countries do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Finance remembers what\r\n\r\nhe  said  on  22nd March. 1959. This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nuseful book at times [Indicating]. His speech  is\r\n\r\ncontained  in  page 26 of Part I of the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\n\"The Tasks Ahead\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You still read that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Why not? When it is to find\r\n\r\nout  the consistencies or the inconsistencies  of\r\n\r\nthe  present  Ministers. On page 26 is  a  speech\r\n\r\ndelivered by Dr Goh Keng Swee at a mass rally at\r\n\r\nDhoby Ghaut on 22nd March, 1959. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By ruthless pruning of Government expenditure,\r\n\r\nwe may be able to add $20 million annually to the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the excuse now is to wait for the\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry on Government  expenditure\r\n\r\nto make its recommendations, and our Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance will wait till 1965. A more simple method\r\n\r\nto  prove  one's  consistency is  by  adding  $20\r\n\r\nmillion   or   $25  million  to  the  Expenditure\r\n\r\nEstimates,  and in the following  year  prune  it\r\n\r\ndown by the same amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us assume for one moment\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister for Finance has no experience\r\n\r\nin  Government affairs, that it is impossible  to\r\n\r\nprune Government expenditure by $20 million, that\r\n\r\nit is even necessary to increase expenditure, and\r\n\r\nthat $45 million should be raised from taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In framing a tax policy, considerations of\r\n\r\nyield,   justice,   administrative   costs,   and\r\n\r\neconomic  effects must be taken into account.  No\r\n\r\ntax law can be enforced for any reasonable length\r\n\r\nof  time  if  it  is against the  wishes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. The repeal of the shopkeepers' tax in the\r\n\r\nFederation  is a clear example. The  people  must\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the tax is just and that  they  are\r\n\r\nasked  to  contribute  on a  just  basis  to  the\r\n\r\nnational effort, and the running of the State. It\r\n\r\nis  possible to convince the people for  a  short\r\n\r\nperiod   of  time  that  the  burden   from   the\r\n\r\nimposition  of new taxes is equitable.  But  this\r\n\r\npropaganda  cannot last for any length  of  time.\r\n\r\nWhen   the   petrol   tax  was  introduced,   the\r\n\r\npropaganda line was that car owners are  \r\n\r\nwell-to-do,  so  they pay petrol tax. When the cigarettes\r\n\r\ntax  was introduced, it was like this: cigarettes\r\n\r\nare  a luxury; beer drinking is not. That is  why\r\n\r\nthere  is no tax on beer. The propaganda  on  the\r\n\r\nlotteries tax was this: this tax is to deal  with\r\n\r\nchap-ji-kee and four digits. However, the  people\r\n\r\nare   waking  up,  when  they  find  that   their\r\n\r\nstandards of living are going down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the basic taxation policy\r\n\r\nadopted  even  in  capitalist  economies  is  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of ability to pay. According  to  this\r\n\r\nprinciple, those who have the greatest wealth  or\r\n\r\nincome  pay  most  of the tax regardless  of  any\r\n\r\nbenefits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  derive.  The ability-to-pay-principle  also\r\n\r\nhelps to equalise the distribution of income  and\r\n\r\nwealth, and leads to progressive taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the new measures introduced by this\r\n\r\nGovernment  are not progressive taxes,  that  is,\r\n\r\ntaxes calculated to tax the wealthy to help-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member must\r\n\r\nrealise  that if he is reading a speech  he  must\r\n\r\nread  a  little slowly, because the  interpreters\r\n\r\nare finding a little difficulty in following him.\r\n\r\nI have indicated that the Member may refer to his\r\n\r\nnotes, but he seems to be doing more than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are\r\n\r\nthree  types  of taxes - progressive, proportional,\r\n\r\nor  regressive. The petrol tax is an  example  of\r\n\r\nproportional  taxation. The taxi-driver  and  the\r\n\r\nsalesman  pay  the same tax as  the  owner  of  a\r\n\r\nMercedez  Benz. Most of the taxes  introduced  by\r\n\r\nthis Government are regressive taxation, that is,\r\n\r\nthe  poor  and  the  wage-earners  are  asked  to\r\n\r\ncontribute more taxes than the rich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the marked characteristics of this\r\n\r\nGovernment's taxation policy is not  that  it  is\r\n\r\nresorting    to    regressive    taxation.    The\r\n\r\ndistinguishing feature in the taxation policy  of\r\n\r\nthis  Government is that it is dovetailed to suit\r\n\r\nthe  interests of big European concerns.  Out  of\r\n\r\nthe 12 new taxes the only contribution from these\r\n\r\nbig European concerns is $1,000. That is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a known fact that\r\n\r\nBritish capital controls our economy. The mode of\r\n\r\norganisation used is the public limited liability\r\n\r\ncompany. May I refresh the memory of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance,  quoting from no less an  authority\r\n\r\nthan  the  Manager  of  the Industrial  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard.  Mr J. J. Puthucheary, who wrote  a  book\r\n\r\ncalled  \"Ownership  and Control  in  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nEconomy\"?  These quotations will serve  to  bring\r\n\r\nhome the point that our economy is dominated  and\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by  European capital  through  public\r\n\r\nlimited companies. It will also show that it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwrong to tax the shopkeepers in favour of British\r\n\r\ncapital. In the preface on page xiv is written:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is a popular view, widely held, that \"the Chinese\" control commerce. This is false. The estimates in the study show that\r\n\r\nEuropean-owned  firms  controlled 65-75 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nexport  trade in 1953 and 60-70 per cent of  the\r\n\r\nimport trade in 1955. European-owned firms  held\r\n\r\nabout 75 per cent of the import agencies against\r\n\r\nsome 10 per cent held by Chinese firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The popular misconception that commerce is\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by  the  Chinese  is  due   to   the\r\n\r\nubiquitous  activity of the  Chinese  middleman.\r\n\r\nCertainly a very large number of Chinese traders\r\n\r\nare  engaged in buying and selling.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nquite  wrong to think that in their  buying  and\r\n\r\nselling these traders in any way control  trade.\r\n\r\nIn   fact,  the  misconception  is  an  \"optical\r\n\r\nillusion\"  due  to  the  very  large  number  of\r\n\r\ntraders. The control of commerce is in  fact  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of  the exporter-importer,  and  the\r\n\r\nimport  and  the export firms are  very  largely\r\n\r\nEuropean.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And on page xix of the Preface:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We can, however, say with confidence that the\r\n\r\ncommonly  held  view that Chinese  dominate  the\r\n\r\neconomy is false. As yet, the Chinese are mainly\r\n\r\nmiddle-men and compradores of European  capital.\r\n\r\nSome   have  become  partners  and  a  few   are\r\n\r\nindependent. The capital that dominates Malaya's\r\n\r\neconomy is European.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And on page xvi of the Preface:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The most important conclusion, I think, of\r\n\r\nthis  study is that much of Malaya's economy  is\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by large-scale units. Of these,  the\r\n\r\nagency  houses and the mining agencies  are  the\r\n\r\nmost  important.  The  belief  that  small-scale\r\n\r\nproducers  and traders dominate the  economy  is\r\n\r\ncaused  by  an incomplete understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nposition of Chinese-owned capital. Another cause\r\n\r\nof   this   mistaken  belief  is  the  lack   of\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the extent of the control  that\r\n\r\nagency   houses,  mining  agencies  and   import\r\n\r\nagencies have over the economy of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A corollary of this is the importance of\r\n\r\npublic limited companies. People who assume that\r\n\r\nChinese  capitalists control the economy  assume\r\n\r\ntoo  that public limited companies play  a  part\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  to that played by private  companies\r\n\r\nand  family  or clan organisations.  The  second\r\n\r\nassumption is false because the first is false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main finding of this study is the\r\n\r\nover-whelming evidence that European-owned firms  are\r\n\r\npredominant in almost all industries. Almost all\r\n\r\nEuropean-owned   firms   are   public    limited\r\n\r\ncompanies  or  subsidiaries  of  public  limited\r\n\r\ncompanies. Some of the large Chinese-owned firms\r\n\r\nare  also  public limited companies.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  can  be any doubt that the most important\r\n\r\ntype  of  business organisation - though not  the\r\n\r\nmost common - is the public limited company.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me give an idea of what\r\n\r\nthis   $1,000  tax  means  to  a  public  limited\r\n\r\ncompany. More than 95 per cent of public  limited\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  owned  by European  capital.  The\r\n\r\n$1,000  tax is a mere facade. In Lyall and  Evatt\r\n\r\n\"Handbook  of  Malayan Stocks and Shares\",  there\r\n\r\nare  listed 37 public limited companies known  in\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange language as Industrials.  I  have\r\n\r\nignored  the  tin  and rubber companies  for  two\r\n\r\nreasons:   firstly,  the  operations   of   these\r\n\r\ncompanies   are  mostly  carried   out   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  and, secondly, the private  companies\r\n\r\nmostly  owned by local capital are more  akin  in\r\n\r\ntheir     activities    to    these     so-called\r\n\r\n\"Industrials\". Mr Speaker, Sir, these 37  public\r\n\r\nlimited  companies classified in  Stock  Exchange\r\n\r\nlanguage as Industrials have a capital of  $6,064\r\n\r\nmillion  and  in one year make a  profit  of  $74\r\n\r\nmillion.  I  lay upon the table a list*  of  them showing  their capital and profits computed  from\r\n\r\nthe handbook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Copy placed in the Assembly Library.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the $45 million additional revenue raised\r\n\r\nby   this   self-proclaimed  Left-wing  socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment,  these  37 public  limited  companies\r\n\r\nwill pay only $37,000 in other words, $37,000 out\r\n\r\nof $45 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me dwell for a few minutes on the so-called company tax in this country. The\r\n\r\ncompanies in Singapore do not pay company tax the\r\n\r\nway  they  do in the United States, Australia  or\r\n\r\nIndia.  This is a colonial device to protect  the\r\n\r\nprofits  of the big European firms. The companies\r\n\r\nin  Singapore do not actually pay company tax the\r\n\r\nway we know it. The present so-called company tax\r\n\r\nis  a  misnomer.  If  I  could  explain  in  \r\n\r\nnon-technical language, the 40 per cent tax paid by a\r\n\r\ncompany on its profits is being paid back to  the\r\n\r\nshareholders  when  the company  distributes  its\r\n\r\nprofits  in the form of dividends. The Government\r\n\r\ncollects 40 per cent from the company and pays it\r\n\r\nback to the shareholders. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheory,  the Government holds the money collected\r\n\r\nfrom  the  companies as a security and not  as  a\r\n\r\ntax.  In other countries even governed by\r\n\r\nRight-wing  capitalists, like the United States,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  company tax, sometimes as high as  50  per\r\n\r\ncent  or  60 per cent, and this tax is  not  paid\r\n\r\nback  to  the  shareholders when the profits  are\r\n\r\ndistributed in the form of dividends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the big European firms make millions of dollars annually and do not\r\n\r\ncontribute to the running of the State because of\r\n\r\nthe nature of our company tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, 40 per cent of the profits of the\r\n\r\ncompanies are collected by the Government in  the\r\n\r\nform of the so-called company tax. When a company\r\n\r\ndistributes  its  profits, the  shareholders  are\r\n\r\npaid back this 40 per cent by the Government. Say\r\n\r\na  shareholder,  Mr  X, has  some  shares  in  a\r\n\r\ncompany.  He  gets a cheque of $6,000  from  this\r\n\r\ncompany  this year. When he declares this  income\r\n\r\nof  $6,000 to the Government, what the Government\r\n\r\ndoes  is to add up his $6,000 to the $4,000, that\r\n\r\nis,  40 per cent of $10,000 and assess him  on  a\r\n\r\ngross income of $10,000. If he is a married  man,\r\n\r\nMr  X  will  pay $350 tax and the Tax Department\r\n\r\nwill send him a cheque of $3,650. In other words,\r\n\r\nMr X in that particular year will receive $6,000\r\n\r\nfrom  the company and $3,650 from the Government,\r\n\r\nmaking  a  total of $9,650. In other  words,  the\r\n\r\ncompany pays no tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is this not a Government of\r\n\r\nthe big business?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> On a point of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Is the Member for Hong Lim,\r\n\r\nas  a practising accountant, seriously suggesting\r\n\r\nthat companies do not pay tax at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker.

We say that  there  are\r\n\r\nmore  than  adequate capital resources  initially\r\n\r\navailable locally. Indeed, the position  is  that\r\n\r\nlarge sums of local capital are being invested in\r\n\r\nforeign    countries,   often   in   unprofitable\r\n\r\ninvestments.   The  total  amount  of   Singapore\r\n\r\ncapital  invested by banks, insurance  companies,\r\n\r\ncentral  government,  local authorities  and  the\r\n\r\npublic boards is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknown  with  certainty.

The\r\n\r\ntaxation  policy of this Government  in  general,\r\n\r\nand  the  1961 Budget in particular,  is  another\r\n\r\nconcrete proof that what this Government seeks to\r\n\r\nuphold  are the interests of big European capital\r\n\r\nand colonial interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance,  whose  real  income  has\r\n\r\nincreased more than ten times since May 1959, the\r\n\r\npeople are worse off now than before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Of all the classes in society, the\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers  are  the worst  hit.  First,  they\r\n\r\nsuffer  a cigarette tax. If a taxi driver  smokes\r\n\r\n20  cigarettes a day, he has to pay about $6  tax\r\n\r\nper  month. We then come to the petrol tax  which\r\n\r\nmakes  him incur an additional $30 per month.  On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, the taxi fare, for instance, from\r\n\r\nBras  Basah Road to Upper Serangoon Circus before\r\n\r\nthe  elections  was 50 cents each passenger,  but\r\n\r\nnow it is 30 cents. In other words, very few taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  are  charging  fares  according  to  the\r\n\r\nmeter.  And if the taxi driver is susceptible  to\r\n\r\nthe  propaganda of this Government and  tries  to\r\n\r\nchange  his  fortunes, then he will be encouraged\r\n\r\nto  pay  lottery  tax, taking  into  account  the\r\n\r\nincreasing   number  of  summonses  and   heavier\r\n\r\npenalties. Mr Speaker. Sir, the taxi  driver  is\r\n\r\nactually between the devil and the deep  sea.  He\r\n\r\nis  considered lucky if he can at present earn $4\r\n\r\na day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to workers and shop assistants.\r\n\r\nTheir   greatest  problem  is  the   problem   of\r\n\r\nretrenchment.   If  he  is  unfortunate   to   be\r\n\r\nunemployed,  he  would be  lucky  to  get  a  few\r\n\r\ndollars from the Social Welfare at reduced  rates\r\n\r\nof  relief. The 1961 Budget estimates to get  $27\r\n\r\nmillion from the sale of lottery tickets. Out  of\r\n\r\n$27 million, $8 million will go to Government  as\r\n\r\ntax,  $11  million will go to the Singapore  Turf\r\n\r\nClub  and the millionaire horse owners as profits\r\n\r\nand  expenses,  and $8 million will  go  back  to\r\n\r\nthese poor people in the form of prizes. In other\r\n\r\nwords, as a class, the workers and all other poor\r\n\r\npeople who are estimated to buy more than 90  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the  lotteries will be made  poorer  in\r\n\r\n1961, by an estimated total of $19 million.  This\r\n\r\n$19  million on the red is a \"gift\" from this\r\n\r\nso-called socialist Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not all. A worker smoking 20 local brand\r\n\r\ncigarettes  daily  will be  made  poorer  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment by $6 per month. There have  been  few\r\n\r\ncases of wage increases in the past 18 months. In\r\n\r\n1958,  the  City Council worker got an  automatic\r\n\r\nincrease  of  40  cents  a  day.  And  now   with\r\n\r\nintegration  in the air, I am wondering  what  is\r\n\r\nthe  Government going to do. Would the Government\r\n\r\nreduce  the wages of the City Council workers  by\r\n\r\n40  cents  or  would the Government increase  the\r\n\r\nwages of the Government workers by -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  on a point of order.

Mr Ong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we now come\r\n\r\nto  the  hawkers. The 1957 census  of  population\r\n\r\nshows   that   there  are  37,180   hawkers   and\r\n\r\nstallholders.  Due  to the increasing  volume  of\r\n\r\nunemployment - the Minister for Labour and Law  has\r\n\r\ngiven  the  figures  of 11,186  unemployed  being\r\n\r\nregistered on 1st November, 1958, i.e. two  years\r\n\r\nago, and 52,963 being registered on 1st November,\r\n\r\n1960, i.e. today - the number of hawkers must  also\r\n\r\nhave   increased  considerably  since  the   1957\r\n\r\ncensus,  which was 37,180 hawkers. More  hawkers,\r\n\r\nmore  taxes  on  the poor and  the  wage  earners\r\n\r\nimposed  by  the  Government would  mean  smaller\r\n\r\nincomes for the hawkers. Smaller incomes, heavier\r\n\r\npenalties,  and further economic exploitation  by\r\n\r\nthe Government in the form of these soak-the-poor\r\n\r\ntaxes  are driving many of the hawkers  to \r\n\r\nsemi-starvation.  Would the Government understand  the\r\n\r\nproblems and the sufferings of the hawkers? I  do\r\n\r\nnot   think   they  do.  The  recent  unfortunate\r\n\r\nincident in St. Michael's Market could have  been\r\n\r\navoided.  There was no necessity to send  a  riot\r\n\r\nsquad  van to chop away the stalls and break  the\r\n\r\ncrockery of the hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we come to the farmers. The 1957 census\r\n\r\ngave  the  number of fanners as 24,289.  This  is\r\n\r\nanother badly hit section of the population.  The\r\n\r\nfarmer  is  now getting less for his produce  but\r\n\r\nhas to pay more taxes. Many of the farmers are in\r\n\r\ndebt,   which   in   turn   affects   the   rural\r\n\r\nshopkeepers, which in turn affects the  retailers\r\n\r\nin  the towns supplying goods to the rural  shops\r\n\r\nand so on. The farmers will be badly exploited by\r\n\r\nthe present proposal to increase assessment rates\r\n\r\nin the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we now come to the general\r\n\r\nwage  earner.  In  my analysis,  the  classes  of\r\n\r\npeople  most  hit are the taxi drivers,  hawkers,\r\n\r\nwhite  collar workers and shopkeepers.  The  wage\r\n\r\nearner  or the teacher has to pay several dollars\r\n\r\na  month more for his smokes, $6 to $10 more  for\r\n\r\npetrol, and a few dollars for lotteries. Is  that\r\n\r\nall,  Mr Speaker, Sir? No, Sir, he is now  asked\r\n\r\nto  pay  more income tax. Among the wage earners,\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  suffer the most - more  hours,  less\r\n\r\npay.  If  everybody tightens  his  belt  for  the\r\n\r\nnational effort, then well and good. But is  that\r\n\r\nthe situation? By no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeans.  The  teacher  did  not  get  a  10  times\r\n\r\nincrease  in  income. He is in a most unfortunate\r\n\r\nposition - no occupational mobility except  perhaps\r\n\r\nrunning  away to the Federation - he  has  to  work\r\n\r\nmore  hours, get less pay, pay more taxes (petrol\r\n\r\ntax, cigarettes tax and now income tax).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shopkeepers. Among the business community,\r\n\r\nthe  small shopkeepers are the hardest  hit.  The\r\n\r\nincreasing  number  of  hawkers  due  to  soaring\r\n\r\nunemployment  share some of their  business.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  else can the hawkers do? Contrary  to  what\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance knows, many shopkeepers\r\n\r\nare affected by the cigarettes tax - for themselves\r\n\r\nand their customers - and sometimes even the petrol\r\n\r\ntax  if  they have a second-hand car used in  the\r\n\r\nshop,  and  other Government licences  and  fees.\r\n\r\nUnder  the recent amendment to the tax laws,  the\r\n\r\nshopkeeper  has  to engage extra hands  to  write\r\n\r\nreceipts,  or  buy a cash register  costing  more\r\n\r\nthan  $1,000.  And when this law  is  introduced,\r\n\r\nthere is only one type of cash register and  that\r\n\r\nis  monopolised  by  an American  firm.  The  new\r\n\r\nBusiness  Registration Tax is aimed at collecting\r\n\r\n$2  million  from  about  40,000  shopkeepers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This is unjust. The change  in  income\r\n\r\ntax   will  also  affect  the  shopkeepers.   The\r\n\r\ncumulative effect of these taxes is that many  of\r\n\r\nthem will join the ranks of the unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a Government which\r\n\r\nbelieves  in  taxing  the  people  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nmainly  the  poor, the workers, the wage  earners\r\n\r\nand  the shopkeepers, for the benefit of the  big\r\n\r\nEuropean   companies.  This  is  not  an   honest\r\n\r\nnationalist  Government.  It  is  a  pro-colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It  is  a  Government  for  the  big\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   Dr   Frederick  Benham,   foremost\r\n\r\nauthority on the economics of colonies,  and  the\r\n\r\nformer  Economic Adviser to the ex-Chief Minister\r\n\r\ncould not have done better for England, and would\r\n\r\nbe  ashamed of himself if he were here today. The\r\n\r\ntaxation  and  economic policies of our  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  who succeeded to the  post  of  Dr\r\n\r\nBenham was in the best tradition of Dr Frederick\r\n\r\nBenham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has also\r\n\r\nforgotten  what  he had said. In column  1015  of\r\n\r\nVol. I of the Hansard, dated 21st November, 1955,\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, a Socialist Government shows\r\n\r\nitself  in  its  taxation and its expenditure.  A\r\n\r\ndemocratic  Socialist  Party  seeks   through   a\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, to introduce taxation in\r\n\r\norder  that money could be taken from  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  and  to introduce social services in  order\r\n\r\nthat money or benefits can be given to those  who\r\n\r\nhave not.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>However, Mr Speaker, Sir, this Government is not\r\n\r\na Socialist Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hansard (12th December, 1958, col. 1217) the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are surprised that the Hon. the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  [i.e. under  the  former  Government]\r\n\r\nshould  have  had the audacity  to  say  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  that  they  can  quite  safely  put  up\r\n\r\ncompany  tax to 40 per cent. He was the same  man\r\n\r\nwho  told  us  last year that there should  be  a\r\n\r\nsafety  margin of at least ten, if not more,  per\r\n\r\ncent.  We  were the first to advocate  that  they\r\n\r\nshould tax companies up to the hilt, according to\r\n\r\nBritish  standards, because most of them  in  any\r\n\r\ncase  are  registered in Britain or the investors\r\n\r\nare from Britain. They can easily go up to 9s, in\r\n\r\nthe  pound  [i.e. nearly 50  per  cent]  without\r\n\r\naffecting anybody's pocket other than that of the\r\n\r\nBritish Treasury.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>However, the best description of this 1961 Budget\r\n\r\nis the one given by the Minister for Health in  a\r\n\r\ndebate   on   the  Labour  Front's  1957   Budget\r\n\r\n[Hansard, Vol. 2 col. 676, 19th November,  1956].\r\n\r\nAt  that  sitting of the Assembly the  \r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  the  P.A.P. was  absent,  and   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health was speaking on behalf of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Mr Speaker, Sir, if, in the process of my\r\n\r\nquoting this speech, I could substitute the words\r\n\r\n\"so-called P.A.P.\" for the words \"Labour  Front\",\r\n\r\nand  the  word  \"S.P.A.\" for the  words  \"Liberal\r\n\r\nSocialist\",   it  would  make  very   interesting\r\n\r\nreading:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, it appears to me that the\r\n\r\nLabour Front Coalition Government is slowly being\r\n\r\nabsorbed  by  the  colonialism they  set  out  to\r\n\r\nconquer  about  a  year  and  a  half  ago.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is ostensibly a Socialist Government.\r\n\r\nWe  heard a great deal of Socialism during  those\r\n\r\nhappy  days  when  the  gentlemen  opposite  were\r\n\r\nwooing  the voters but that was a long time  ago,\r\n\r\nSir.  Since  then,  they have  been  successfully\r\n\r\nbrainwashed by their colonial backseat drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget, Sir, is proof that the Labour Front\r\n\r\nhas  been purged of all Socialist deviations. Not\r\n\r\nonly  is  that  Budget purged of every  tinge  of\r\n\r\nSocialism  but  it  is utterly shameless  in  its\r\n\r\nconcern   for   great   business   and   colonial\r\n\r\ninterests. With the Labour Front Government as  a\r\n\r\nfront, the colonial backseat drivers had tried to\r\n\r\nsoak the poor while leaving the rich untouched. I\r\n\r\nsaid \"tried\", Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  since the announcements of  the  Budget,\r\n\r\nthere has been some panicky backtracking. It  may\r\n\r\nbe  because the Labour Front Coalition Government\r\n\r\nwas   particularly  impressed  by   the   Liberal\r\n\r\nSocialists.  Even  the Liberal  Socialists,  Sir,\r\n\r\nfelt  that  the Budget was an attempt to  balance\r\n\r\nthe  budget  at the expense of the  lower  income\r\n\r\nworkers.  Surely the Government could  have  told\r\n\r\nthe  backseat  drivers to produce a Budget  which\r\n\r\nlooked  like  a Socialist Budget... Ask  yourself.\r\n\r\nThe  fact that the blunder over the lower  income\r\n\r\ngroups  has  been put right does  not  make  this\r\n\r\nBudget any better. In fact, the protests over the\r\n\r\ninjustice  done to the low wage earner have  only\r\n\r\ndrawn attention to the fact that this is still  a\r\n\r\nBudget  designed to aid and comfort big  business\r\n\r\nand  colonial interests. This is certainly not  a\r\n\r\nBudget  expected of a Party which  claims  to  be\r\n\r\nSocialist, Nationalist or champion of the Welfare\r\n\r\nState.  The only kind of welfare that this Budget\r\n\r\nwill  further  is  capitalist  welfare  and,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, the foreign capitalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget was designed to meet a specific\r\n\r\nproblem  and  that  was the $37  million  deficit\r\n\r\nexpected in 1957. This deficit was to be  met  by\r\n\r\nthe  increase in income tax by lowering the basic\r\n\r\npersonal allowance which would have hit hard  the\r\n\r\nlower  income  group but the higher income  group\r\n\r\nwas  let off very lightly, indeed so lightly that\r\n\r\neven   the  Liberal-Socialists  felt  happy   and\r\n\r\njubilant enough to take up the cudgels on  behalf\r\n\r\nof   the   poor  wage  earner.  For  a  Socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Sir  - and I hope I  am  not  unduly\r\n\r\nembarrassing the Government by assuming  that  it\r\n\r\nstill  believes  in its election pledges - taxation\r\n\r\nis  one way of bringing about greater equality of\r\n\r\nincome  and  Malaya is a country where inequality\r\n\r\nof   income  prevails.  This  was  the  necessary\r\n\r\noutcome of a colonial economy. There has been  no\r\n\r\nproper  survey of distribution of  income  but  a\r\n\r\nsurvey of urban income-'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In my opinion, it\r\n\r\nis   not   necessary.  We  can  prune  down   all\r\n\r\nextravagant expenditure. There is no intention to\r\n\r\ncomplete  all  the  Development  Estimates.   The\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates are prepared in a haphazard\r\n\r\nmanner with hardly any plans. I remember that  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  1960  I  instructed  the  Public   Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  to obtain details of plans  from  the\r\n\r\nrespective  Ministries, particularly  the  Health\r\n\r\nand  Education Ministries, to submit their  plans\r\n\r\nin   order   to   fulfil  the  1960   Development\r\n\r\nEstimates.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I was  shocked  to\r\n\r\nlearn  that there were hardly any plans.  On  1st\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1960, the Public Works Department  was\r\n\r\ntaken  over  by the Prime Minister. He  formed  a\r\n\r\nPublic Works Standing Committee to run the Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department and to be responsible  for  all\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects. The Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  was  refused even  the  minutes  and\r\n\r\nagenda of the meetings. The Public Works Standing\r\n\r\nCommittee  was  made responsible to  the  Cabinet\r\n\r\nBudget  Sub-Committee,  its  Chairman  being  the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister,  and  its  members  being   the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Finance  and  the  Deputy   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.   The  Budget  Sub-Committee   is   not\r\n\r\nresponsible to the Cabinet and does not report to\r\n\r\nthe Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than a year, Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works  Standing  Committee  did  nothing.\r\n\r\nDuring the few meetings that they had, they spent\r\n\r\nmost  of  their time talking on the  minor  works\r\n\r\nprojects,  an item in the Development  Estimates,\r\n\r\nfrom  which funds could be allocated for purposes\r\n\r\nsuch   as  beautifying  Sri  Temasek.  The   best\r\n\r\narchitects  and  engineers were directed  towards\r\n\r\nsuch  jobs.  Many other architects and  engineers\r\n\r\nremained idle, having no work to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other reason for there\r\n\r\nbeing no necessity to dig into the pockets of the\r\n\r\npoor,  the  wage earners and shopkeepers  in  the 1961 Budget  is  that there is a possibility  of\r\n\r\nreducing   millions  of  dollars  of  extravagant\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  and only our Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\ncould set an example. In my opinion, there is  no\r\n\r\nneed  to  dig into the pockets of the  people  at\r\n\r\nthis hour when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntimes  are especially bad. What the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance said is not true.

There has been a marked expansion  in\r\n\r\ntrade, in industrial output, in the standards  of\r\n\r\npersonal consumption, in business confidence,  in\r\n\r\nthe  conditions of workers, and in the  level  of\r\n\r\npublic services.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, this is not true,  because  on\r\n\r\nthe same day the Minister for Labour and Law,  in\r\n\r\nreply  to  an  oral question from  an  Opposition\r\n\r\nMember  [col.  4],  said that there  were  11,186\r\n\r\nunemployed  on  1st November,  1958,  and  52,963\r\n\r\nunemployed  two years later, i.e.  1st  November,\r\n\r\n1960. Mr  Speaker, Sir, these facts  speak  for\r\n\r\nthemselves. The unemployment figure is  the  best\r\n\r\nyardstick  of  the  economic  welfare   and   the\r\n\r\nprosperity of a people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> No, Sir, If it is necessary to\r\n\r\nfind  this  money with the sincere  intention  of\r\n\r\ncarrying on with capital construction in the 1961\r\n\r\nBudget  rather  than  just  for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\npropaganda,  like  in  the 1960\r\n\r\nBudget -  window-washing - then boost the economy.

It is  not\r\n\r\nan abstract talk on political propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put forward these alternative proposals for\r\n\r\nthe consideration of Government:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Reform, the present archaic so-called company\r\n\r\ntax  by  stages. The Tax Department  wastes  much\r\n\r\ntime computing repayments of tax to shareholders.\r\n\r\nLevy  a  tax. Let us call it the Corporation  Tax\r\n\r\nfor   distinction,   as   practised   in   India,\r\n\r\nAustralia,  or  the  United  States   and   other\r\n\r\ncountries.  This  non-refundable corporation  tax\r\n\r\ncan  be  fixed at 10 per cent in the first stage,\r\n\r\nwhile  at  the same time the 10 per cent  can  be\r\n\r\nincreased  by  stages  to a  maximum  which  will\r\n\r\nensure  a reasonable profit to investors. At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  the  present  so-called  company  tax\r\n\r\nshould  be  reduced by an equivalent  percentage.\r\n\r\nThis  method  of  taxation  will  discourage  the\r\n\r\nprivate  companies  from distributing  all  their\r\n\r\nprofits in dividends which they are now doing  so\r\n\r\nas  to  claim  repayment from the Tax Department.\r\n\r\nThis is not healthy for the country at present as\r\n\r\nit  is  not  conducive to economic and industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion. Later, when the economic situation  is\r\n\r\nbetter  and things are not as gloomy as they  are\r\n\r\nnow,  an income tax on undistributed profits  can\r\n\r\nbe  levied to ensure a reasonable distribution of\r\n\r\nprofits  as  dividends in the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nExchequer. The present tax of $750 and $1,000  on\r\n\r\nprivate  and  public  companies  respectively  is\r\n\r\nunnecessary. Mr Speaker, this tax proposal  will\r\n\r\nnot  impose undue hardships on those shareholders\r\n\r\nwho  are Singapore residents, due to the benefits\r\n\r\nfrom big joint stock companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Open negotiations with the British\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the Shell Company, for  instance,\r\n\r\nabout  paying  assessments on  their  properties.\r\n\r\nPerhaps   negotiate   also   with   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  a tax on their military  trucks;\r\n\r\nsome  of them are 18-ton trucks and they  do  not\r\n\r\npay even one single cent of road tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Review the death duties tax. I am sure few\r\n\r\npeople will move their residence to Johore  Bahru\r\n\r\njust  for  the  purpose of evading heavier  death\r\n\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these are my humble proposals.\r\n\r\nI  have not been given time to work them out on a\r\n\r\nmore  concrete  basis for more details.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  Government does not lack experts. What  they\r\n\r\nlack is a correct policy in the interests of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The experts, after all, carry  out  that\r\n\r\npolicy.  The taxes introduced by this  Government\r\n\r\nto  tax  the poor and the wage earners should  be\r\n\r\nreconsidered really on the principle  of  ability\r\n\r\nto pay. Some of the new taxes should be repealed.\r\n\r\nOthers can be amended or reformed. Those who  can\r\n\r\nafford should contribute more; those who are less\r\n\r\nwell-off  should  contribute  less.  The  present\r\n\r\npolicy of opening all guns on those who are  less\r\n\r\nwell-off and on the poor must be reversed. We are\r\n\r\nnot  asking  the Government to tax  the  European\r\n\r\nfirms until they bleed and run away. No, Sir.  We\r\n\r\nonly   ask  that  the  taxation  policy  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  should be fair and just.

There is a shortage  of\r\n\r\ndoctors  and  their posts have not  been  filled.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the many points stated therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with regard to the Government's financial policy on the whole, we know clearly\r\n\r\nthat  the question of trade with Indonesia - import\r\n\r\nand  export - could be said to be slackening.  This\r\n\r\nis what the Members of the Opposition have talked\r\n\r\nabout earlier. Although there is a surplus in the\r\n\r\nGovernment  financial estimates, I am  completely\r\n\r\nsurprised why the Government has failed to  spend\r\n\r\nmoney  in  the  public interest, with  particular\r\n\r\nreference  to  the rural areas.  There  are  many\r\n\r\nservices which could be provided to the public if\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure  provided for is  utilised.  But\r\n\r\nfrom  what  I  can see, the monies  provided  for\r\n\r\nthese services are not spent but are put into the\r\n\r\nEstimates   so  that  the  so-called  inefficient\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  balance expenditure  and  income\r\n\r\nwith  a  view  to having a surplus for  the  year\r\n\r\n1961. Mr Speaker, I am unable to understand  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for  the vacant posts not being  filled.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  given is that persons  from  abroad,\r\n\r\nsuch as engineers, doctors and others, cannot  be\r\n\r\nobtained.

Those who contravene\r\n\r\nthese  regulations or who default will be  fined.\r\n\r\nHas  the Government estimated the yield from such\r\n\r\nfines?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I still remember the Prime Minister's reply to the Member for Cairnhill when\r\n\r\nthe  latter challenged the Government to hold \r\n\r\nby-elections   in   Singapore   in   a   number   of\r\n\r\nconstituencies. The Prime Minister said  that  no\r\n\r\nuseful purpose would be served because there  was\r\n\r\nno  need  to waste public funds, which  had  been\r\n\r\ncollected  from  the  people  of  Singapore,   on\r\n\r\nholding such by-elections. Whether the Government\r\n\r\nwas  afraid of the challenge or whether it wanted\r\n\r\nto  save  money,  it is left to all  Members  to\r\n\r\ndecide  for  themselves. But I am surprised,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,    since    it    seems    that - although\r\n\r\nunofficially in this Chamber - the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty, through its official organ and through the\r\n\r\nmedium  of local newspapers has challenged  three\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. Members in this Assembly to contest  the\r\n\r\nby-elections  because they say we are  no  longer\r\n\r\nrepresenting our Party. I am shocked that, on the\r\n\r\none  hand,  they  are making an  effort  to  save\r\n\r\nmoney,   but,  on  the  other  hand,  they   have\r\n\r\nchallenged  U.M.N.O. Members  to  stand  for \r\n\r\nby-elections.  It  is  clear  that  the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nchallenging the U.M.N.O. Members to prove to  the\r\n\r\nMalays   whether  or  not  they  are,  in   fact,\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the Malays. So I am at  a  loss  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  this, Mr Speaker. But our  faith  is\r\n\r\nstill firm, and God Almighty will have compassion\r\n\r\non  us  and  our  Organisation will  go  back  to\r\n\r\nnormal.  Although  the  challenge  has  not  been\r\n\r\nvoiced in this House, I hope, not because we want\r\n\r\nto preserve our seats but because -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. My difficulty now is to\r\n\r\nrelate the hon. Member's speech to the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Standing Order which perhaps I ought  to\r\n\r\nread.  Standing  Order 83, paragraph  (1),  inter\r\n\r\nalia, reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... the debate ... shall stand adjourned for not\r\n\r\nless  than  seven clear days and,  when  resumed,\r\n\r\nshall  be  confined to the general principles  of\r\n\r\nGovernment policy and administration as set forth\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister  in moving the  motion  and  as\r\n\r\nindicated in the Main Estimates.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So,  in  so far as this challenge to the U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nis  concerned, I have up till now failed  to  see\r\n\r\nhow  that  is  related to the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nStanding Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nmerely wish to clarify the financial position  as\r\n\r\nit  stands.  However, Mr Speaker,  the  question\r\n\r\nwhich I have raised just now could be related  to\r\n\r\nanother matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Singapore Government in 1954, that is, the then Colonial Government, had loaned\r\n\r\nmoney   to  the  tune  of  $30  million  to   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya to fight  Communism.  That\r\n\r\nloan  is  to be paid by the latest in ten  years'\r\n\r\ntime.  Therefore, the surplus which is  indicated\r\n\r\nhere  includes  the  $30  million  paid  by   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya to the Singapore Government.\r\n\r\nI pay tribute to the Federation Government who is\r\n\r\nsympathising with the Government of Singapore  by\r\n\r\nrepaying  the  loan before the  time  is  due.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the reason  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment asking for the $30 million loan to  be\r\n\r\nrepaid  during  the  life-time  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party is that it could be used for various\r\n\r\naspects  for the benefit of the State.  It  means\r\n\r\nthat  before the forthcoming elections,  the  $30\r\n\r\nmillion  will  have  been  spent  by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment to defend its ability in the matter of\r\n\r\nthe  financial state of affairs of Singapore.  We\r\n\r\non  the Opposition are not surprised. If the view\r\n\r\nof  the  present P.A.P. Government is to ask  for\r\n\r\nthe  repayment of the $30 million so that victory\r\n\r\ncould be achieved in the next elections, it  does\r\n\r\nnot matter. But it is clear that the solution  to\r\n\r\nthe  question of finance is still lagging behind,\r\n\r\nwhereas the population is on the increase and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunemployment  is  also on the increase.  This  is\r\n\r\nanother  major  problem which has  not  yet  been\r\n\r\nresolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nthere  is  also  a  surplus  to  the  amount   of\r\n\r\n$400,000.  Good,  well  done!  The  Ministry   is\r\n\r\nefficient in the performance of its tasks. But  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  to  use millions of dollars  for  the\r\n\r\npropaganda  purpose of creating  one  culture  in\r\n\r\nSingapore on the basis of Government's concept of\r\n\r\na  Malayan  culture  is most unsatisfactory.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health, who has elucidated  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of culture, is absent from the  Chamber\r\n\r\ntoday.  He has accused me and has alleged that  I\r\n\r\nam  conservative  and am afraid that  this  House\r\n\r\nwill  be  dissolved. But outside this Chamber,  a\r\n\r\ndifferent version was told in the newspapers.  So\r\n\r\nI  do not know whether the Government is wrong in\r\n\r\ngiving  an answer that is motivated by sentiment.\r\n\r\nWe  from  the Opposition, however, bring  forward\r\n\r\nthe  opinion of the electorate we represent.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  whether the Government, especially  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture,  in spending  millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars,  could evolve a culture  or  whether  it\r\n\r\ncould  accept  Malay culture as the  basis  of  a\r\n\r\nMalayan culture, it is left to it to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am not a member of the P.A.P., but I have been presented with a booklet entitled\r\n\r\n\"The  Tasks Ahead\" by the Hon. Minister.  But  it\r\n\r\nmay be that our Minister for Health has forgotten\r\n\r\nthat   in  \"The  Tasks  Ahead\"  there  have  been\r\n\r\nmentioned  topics  dealing with  such  things  as\r\n\r\n\"Economic  Roots of Communalism\", \"Racialism  and\r\n\r\nEconomic Status Quo\" and \"Poverty Knows No  Race\"\r\n\r\nand  many  other  topics. I have gone  over  them\r\n\r\ncarefully.  I admit that the writer is efficient,\r\n\r\nwise and smart, but I am surprised at the mention\r\n\r\nin  the  Budget  speech that the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty  has been elected by the people and  is  on\r\n\r\nthe   side  of  the  workers  by  protecting  and\r\n\r\nsafeguarding their interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not my intention to speak outside the confines of this debate, but I wish\r\n\r\nto  stress this: will the Government be  able  to\r\n\r\nrecruit personnel with such a financial policy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently it also accused communal parties without\r\n\r\nfirst making investigations into the question  of\r\n\r\nlabour   relations.  I  am  sure  that  such   an\r\n\r\naccusation  is  levelled at  the  Opposition  and\r\n\r\nparticularly at U.M.N.O. I wish to  say  that  if\r\n\r\nthere  are  among  us those who indulge  in  such\r\n\r\nmatters, I hope the Government with the power and\r\n\r\ncomplete  State  machinery at its  disposal  will\r\n\r\ntake the necessary action. But it should not just\r\n\r\npoint  an  accusing finger at us. We on our  side\r\n\r\nrealise  that  before a common  identity  can  be\r\n\r\nestablished, it is difficult to depart  from  the\r\n\r\npolicy of our Party. I hope, Mr Speaker, it  can\r\n\r\nbe said in this Chamber whether U.M.N.O. has ever\r\n\r\ndone such a thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to cut short my speech, I wish to say that I do not know what is going to happen to\r\n\r\nthe  Malays  as they are governed by a  socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment.   There  are  Malays  who   represent\r\n\r\nSocialist Parties. But I hope what is enunciated\r\n\r\nin  the Singapore Constitution of 1958, which was\r\n\r\npromulgated and tabled in the English  Parliament\r\n\r\nand  which became effective since then,  will  be\r\n\r\ndischarged.  If the Estimates are  based  on  the\r\n\r\nConstitution, I cannot really see what  help  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will be able to give to the Malays  as\r\n\r\nthe  indigenous  people of the  island  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Mr Speaker, if it is said that I am a\r\n\r\ncommunalist,  I accept that. But that  cannot  be\r\n\r\neradicated  until  there is positive  proof  that\r\n\r\nmonetary  help  will be given to  the  Malays  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  fail  to see in  the  Government's\r\n\r\nplans  the  methods  by which the  Government  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to help the Malays in the economic  field.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if they are compared with the plans  of\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Action Party,  they  are  directed\r\n\r\nentirely towards the Federation of Malaya. But  I\r\n\r\ncannot see why they are not being implemented  in\r\n\r\nSingapore today. If the Government wishes to  do\r\n\r\nit, there is nothing to prevent it from doing so.\r\n\r\nI   note,  Mr  Speaker,  that  there  are  Malay\r\n\r\nsettlements,   low-cost   houses,    and    their\r\n\r\nallocation,  and so on, but I think,  aside  from\r\n\r\nall  this,  that  the  question  of  raising  the\r\n\r\neconomic  status  of the Malays should  be  fully\r\n\r\nencouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in col. 10 of Hansard, Volume 14, No. 1  of\r\n\r\n29th  November,  1960, the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... during election campaigning, irresponsible\r\n\r\nRight-wing  Parties  worked  themselves  into   a\r\n\r\nfright.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It would not have mattered if the hysteria they\r\n\r\ngenerated  confined itself to those  parties  and\r\n\r\ntheir  few  well-wishers.

That\r\n\r\nis what she cannot do in this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the\r\n\r\nBudget   Statement  made  by  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance,  he  said (Hansard dated 29th  November,\r\n\r\n1960, Vol. 14 No. 1, at column 23:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A right-wing government would view this\r\n\r\n[increasing unemployment] not with alarm but with\r\n\r\ndelight.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>How  irresponsible can a Government statement be?\r\n\r\nDoes  the  Minister for Finance suggest that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment across the Causeway - because they  are\r\n\r\na    Right-wing   Government - would   view   their\r\n\r\nincreasing unemployment with delight? Moreover, I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that the public would like to know  who\r\n\r\nare  the  Right-wing and who form the  Left-wing!\r\n\r\nThe  Government say that the Opposition is  Right\r\n\r\nof them and then they claim that there is a group\r\n\r\nthat  is  Left of them. Sir, relatively they  are\r\n\r\nRight  of that group and they can still be called\r\n\r\na  Right-wing Government. Sir, instead of telling\r\n\r\nthe  House how the Government intend to solve the\r\n\r\nunemployment  problem,  the  Minister   is   more\r\n\r\ninterested   in  predicting  the  reaction   that\r\n\r\nincreasing unemployment would have on a  Rightist\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  all that the  Minister  has  to\r\n\r\noffer  is  employment  for 2,500  out  of  nearly\r\n\r\n60,000 unemployed - and that too if the progress is\r\n\r\nwhat the Minister expects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On income tax, Sir, the Minister goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A socialist Government will get the money\r\n\r\nthrough taxation in such a way that those who can\r\n\r\nafford   to   pay   taxes  share   the   greatest\r\n\r\nresponsibility.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, Sir, the question arises as to whether\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. is a socialist Government. If we judge\r\n\r\nthem by their proposal of the new income tax,  we\r\n\r\nwould  say that they are not, because in the  new\r\n\r\nproposal,  the poor and the lower middle  classes\r\n\r\nare  the  hardest hit. The Minister  proposes  to\r\n\r\nlower  the  personal  allowance  from  $3,000  to\r\n\r\n$2,000,  and  from $2,000 to $1,000 so  that  the\r\n\r\nrates between Singapore and the Federation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould not differ substantially. We cannot hope to\r\n\r\nimitate  the Federation. In the Federation  where\r\n\r\nthere is a boom, it could be easily expected that\r\n\r\na family of three or four grown-up children would\r\n\r\nall be working; but in Singapore where 60,000 are\r\n\r\nunemployed  a family with three or four  grown-up\r\n\r\nchildren  and a few small children may have  only\r\n\r\none  son working and supporting the whole family.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  common thing in Singapore  to  find  a\r\n\r\nbachelor  working to support his father,  mother,\r\n\r\nbrothers,  sisters,  and grandparents  sometimes,\r\n\r\nand  because of his many dependants, he is forced\r\n\r\nto   remain  a  bachelor  and  be  penalised   by\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  being one by having  his  relief\r\n\r\nreduced  to $2,000 with no relief whatsoever  for\r\n\r\nhis  dependants. This is not the case in England.\r\n\r\nWorse hit than the bachelor is the married woman.\r\n\r\nImmediately  she  gets married, her  relief  goes\r\n\r\ndown  to  $1,000 and the rate of her tax goes  up\r\n\r\nbecause  her  income is pooled with that  of  her\r\n\r\nhusband's.   Sir,   this  is   the   price   that\r\n\r\nSingapore's   young  people  pay  for   a   legal\r\n\r\nmarriage.  When a couple live in sin they  escape\r\n\r\nall  these  penalties, because in so far  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   are  concerned  they  are   separate\r\n\r\nindividuals.   Surely,   Government    are    not\r\n\r\nencouraging  people to live in sin  in  view  of\r\n\r\ntheir  policy  against  yellow  culture.  Or,  on\r\n\r\nsecond  thoughts, could that be  the  reason  for\r\n\r\ntheir delay in reintroducing the Women's Charter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of a deficit, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance had this to say in  Hansard\r\n\r\nof  29th November, 1960, Vol. 14, No. 1 at  column\r\n\r\n25:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It may also be noted that total expenditure\r\n\r\nnever  does  keep  up  with  the  Estimates...  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  from  1950 to 1958, total  expenditure\r\n\r\nhad  never  exceeded  total estimates  except  in\r\n\r\n1954... it was only in 1951 and 1952 that estimates\r\n\r\nwere  nearly achieved by actual expenditure.  For\r\n\r\nthe rest, expenditure fell short of estimates...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  when the Member for Tanglin tried to  point\r\n\r\nthis  outlast  year,  he  was  ridiculed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, who is now saying  exactly\r\n\r\nthe  same thing in almost the same words.  Surely\r\n\r\nan economist who is able to change an $8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion deficit into a $37 million surplus  never\r\n\r\nneeds  to  panic at a threatened  deficit  of  $6\r\n\r\nmillion  that  was budgeted for. It  is  commonly\r\n\r\nbelieved, Sir, that this panic was whipped up for\r\n\r\nthe following purposes:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To justify the slash in pay of civil servants\r\n\r\nwho  perhaps  have been suspected of  not  having\r\n\r\nvoted for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To scare the public and antagonise them\r\n\r\nagainst the civil servants who dare object to the\r\n\r\nslash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To antagonise the public against the previous\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slashing of pay by Government and this\r\n\r\narrangement  of a Member of the Government  Bench\r\n\r\nto   fight   against  the  Government   for   the\r\n\r\nrestitution of the pay and Government's  dramatic\r\n\r\ngesture  of  restoring part of the  cut - Sir,  all\r\n\r\nthese  performances are signs of an immature  and\r\n\r\nan  amateur government. However, for the sake  of\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants  who  have  suffered  enough\r\n\r\nhardships,  we too will join the \"let's  pretend\"\r\n\r\ngame  and  wish the Government Member \"Good  luck\r\n\r\nand   success!\"  in  his  negotiations  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on behalf of the civil  servants.  We\r\n\r\nhope  that he will succeed in getting not only  a\r\n\r\npartial restoration, but a full restoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to point out that when\r\n\r\nconsidering  the  proposals  of  income  tax  and\r\n\r\nassessments, it is necessary to bear in mind that\r\n\r\na  million  dollars  may seem  very  small  to  a\r\n\r\nmillionaire. But the last mite is very  great  to\r\n\r\na, widow. So when Government says. \"It is only  a\r\n\r\nfew  dollars  that the poor have to  pay\",  well,\r\n\r\nthose few dollars mean much more to them than the\r\n\r\nmillions  mean  to  a millionaire.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nfurther promised to return all taxes garnered  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to the people  in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nschools,  hospitals, etc. May I be so bold,  Sir,\r\n\r\nas  to remind him that 18 months have gone by and\r\n\r\nthe Government has built neither a hospital nor a\r\n\r\nschool?  And  with  due  respect,  Sir,  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister, may I again quote what he said at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  his speech, that \"a government  is\r\n\r\njudged  not  so much by its expressions  of  good\r\n\r\nintentions but by its concrete achievements\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the\r\n\r\ndebate  on the Minister's Annual Budget Statement\r\n\r\nfor  the  year  1961, I take this opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexpress my views because of the importance of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  financial  policy,  since  it  will\r\n\r\ndetermine whether it will be good or bad for  the\r\n\r\nState  of Singapore. From what we have been  able\r\n\r\nto  gather from the statement of the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance,  it  cannot be said to be a  progressive\r\n\r\nstatement  which one can be proud of,  especially\r\n\r\nfor  its surpluses and programmes formulated  for\r\n\r\n1961.  There is no need for me to go into  detail\r\n\r\non  the  surpluses, because this point  has  been\r\n\r\ntouched upon by my colleagues on this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse.   But  when  we  plan  for  progress   for\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  its people in the future,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant to consider the reasons for the present\r\n\r\ncondition   and  the  difficult  situation   that\r\n\r\nexists.  Mr Speaker, the Party which is  now  in\r\n\r\noffice,   during   the   general   elections   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  hoping  to  be  returned  to   power,\r\n\r\nformulated  a  programme to  attract  the  masses\r\n\r\nwithout  going  deeply into the question  of  its\r\n\r\nability to fulfil its promises. Apart from  that,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, the modus operandi of the Government\r\n\r\nshocked many important sections in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch upon the speech which is\r\n\r\nbeing  strongly defended in Hansard, at col.  20,\r\n\r\nwhen  it  said,  \"The  P.A.P.  Government  is   a\r\n\r\nGovernment elected by the people and is one  that\r\n\r\nis partial to the working class.\" I think that as\r\n\r\na government, it cannot take sides, but it should\r\n\r\nbe  impartial to all and not merely to  side  the\r\n\r\nworkers or businessmen or Government workers.  If\r\n\r\nwe  take sides, as has been mentioned, it  means,\r\n\r\nin  effect,  that that section of  the  community\r\n\r\nwhich the Government is unable to side with  will\r\n\r\nnot  receive  a guarantee that they can  live  in\r\n\r\npeace in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.  For instance, we know  that  although\r\n\r\nimports  of  commodities  are  on  the  increase,\r\n\r\nbusiness  is declining. Mr Speaker, if we  study\r\n\r\nthe  lives  of  the trishaw riders and  the  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers,  we  will find that they are  frustrated\r\n\r\nand worried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the plan to industrialise in\r\n\r\nthe  year to come, it is indeed a good programme.\r\n\r\nIt  is a programme in which we can have faith and\r\n\r\nin which certain sections of the unemployed could\r\n\r\nfind  employment.  But the  possibility  of  such\r\n\r\nindustrialisation being carried out still remains\r\n\r\na  question mark, because, Mr Speaker, we in the\r\n\r\nState  of  Singapore are exactly like the  waiter\r\n\r\nwho,  if  he  is  unable  to  serve  his  patrons\r\n\r\nproperly,  will cause dissatisfaction  among  his\r\n\r\npatrons,  and  so cannot expect a good  business.\r\n\r\nTherefore, what has been achieved during the past\r\n\r\none   and   a   half  years  has  brought   about\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction among the people. Can we be proud\r\n\r\nof  our  ability to govern the people? We can  do\r\n\r\nthis;  we can do that; but all the means of doing\r\n\r\nthem should come from the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I feel that the Government has somewhat slowed down in their momentum.\r\n\r\nPreviously  their hatred for the capitalists  has\r\n\r\nbeen great, but today the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Prime Minister has blamed the capitalist\r\n\r\ncountries for not giving assistance to Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt looks as though we in Singapore are going down\r\n\r\non  our knees to the capitalists for aid. On  the\r\n\r\nquestion of how to live, Mr Speaker, we could do\r\n\r\nwonders.  Today  we say one thing,  and  tomorrow\r\n\r\nanother   thing.  This  shows  our   inconsistent\r\n\r\nattitude,  our tendency to distort facts.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot practise what we preach. We should put a stop\r\n\r\nto  this. On the other hand, we must rectify  our\r\n\r\nmistakes  made  during the past one  and  a  half\r\n\r\nyears.  It  is hoped that the State of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  give impartial treatment to all the  people\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  so  that  all  sections  of   the\r\n\r\npopulation may benefit. That is all that  I  have\r\n\r\nto  say  in the debate on the Government's fiscal\r\n\r\npolicy  for the year 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nas  we are approaching the time for the moment of\r\n\r\ninterruption, I do not propose to take much  time\r\n\r\nfor  my  speech on the Finance Minister's  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement.  But there are a few important  points\r\n\r\nin  that statement which require me to make  some\r\n\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is obvious to us that the Budget\r\n\r\nstatement   of  the  Minister  for   Finance   is\r\n\r\nspecifically  meant for foreign consumption.  The\r\n\r\nMinister recently went a-begging overseas, and we\r\n\r\nare  informed that he has been told that we  must\r\n\r\nshow  what  we  are prepared to do for  ourselves\r\n\r\nbefore  overseas  assistance can be  forthcoming.\r\n\r\nWith  an  eye  to  this, Sir,  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\ntherefore  injected into his Budget  statement  a\r\n\r\nsynthetic buoyancy. The Minister claims that 1960\r\n\r\nhas  been a better year than 1959 and that  there\r\n\r\nhas  been considerable improvement all round.  He\r\n\r\nquotes  statistics, Sir, to prove his contention.\r\n\r\nWe know that figures can sometimes give the wrong\r\n\r\npicture. Take, for instance, Sir, the figures for\r\n\r\nbank   advances.  It  is  claimed  that   because\r\n\r\nSeptember bank advances were very much more  than\r\n\r\nJanuary  advances, therefore, the trade  position\r\n\r\nhas improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (MR G. KANDASAMY) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a totally different interpretation can also\r\n\r\nhold  good.  The  fact  that  bank  advances   in\r\n\r\nSeptember were very much higher than advances  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  could be due to the fact that businesses\r\n\r\nfinanced by bank loans were having difficulty  in\r\n\r\nmeeting  their commitments. I know  for  a  fact,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  many  rice and sugar  merchants  have\r\n\r\nsuffered  considerable losses, and that they  are\r\n\r\nhaving difficulty in meeting their bank bills. We\r\n\r\nknow,  Sir,  that  it  is a  common  practice  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  banks not to take drastic  action\r\n\r\nagainst  businesses to whom they have lent  large\r\n\r\nadvances  in the hope that, if given time,  these\r\n\r\nbusinesses  would  be able to pull  through  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, cut their losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Sir, there is a common barometer\r\n\r\nto   gauge  the  economic  circumstances  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation. I refer to coffee shops, Sir. Sir, it\r\n\r\nhas  never  happened in Singapore  before  for  a\r\n\r\ncoffee  shop to close down business. And  yet  in\r\n\r\nthe year 1960 many coffee shops have closed down,\r\n\r\na year which has been claimed by the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  to  be a good year, a year in  which  he\r\n\r\nsays there has been considerable improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a number of goldsmiths of long\r\n\r\nestablished reputation have also closed  down  in\r\n\r\n1960.  If  there  is considerable improvement  in\r\n\r\n1960,  why  is  it that the unemployment  figures\r\n\r\nhave increased? If 1960 has been a good year, why\r\n\r\nis  it that hawkers, taxi-drivers and businessmen\r\n\r\nare  groaning, and a large number of workers  are\r\n\r\nearning much less?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If 1960 is better than 1959,\r\n\r\nwhy  is  that  the T.U.C. is more concerned  with\r\n\r\nworking  out a scheme for retrenchment of workers\r\n\r\nthan  concerning itself with the placing  of  new\r\n\r\nemployees  in  employment?

I quote the same Hansard,  at\r\n\r\ncol. 16:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The cigarette industry continues to make great\r\n\r\nstrides, the quantity produced in the first  nine\r\n\r\nmonths  of  the year increasing from 1.6  million\r\n\r\npounds  in 1959 to 2.1 million pounds this  year,\r\n\r\nan increase of 28 per cent.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  wonder, Sir, whether this increase of  28  per\r\n\r\ncent  is on the credit side or on the debit  side\r\n\r\nof Government's economic policy. The Minister has\r\n\r\nstated,  Sir, that as a result of this change  in\r\n\r\nconsumer habits, there will be a shortfall of  $3\r\n\r\nmillion  this year. In this connection, Sir,  let\r\n\r\nus  see  what  the Minister said  in  his  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech last year. I quote Hansard, volume 11, No.\r\n\r\n13, col. 805, at the bottom of the column:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There may be adjustments to the tax on tobacco,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  factors which  I  have  previously\r\n\r\ndiscussed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  what are these facts, Sir? The same Hansard,\r\n\r\ncol. 791, gives the answer. What are these facts?\r\n\r\nAt the middle of the column:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The duty on tobacco goes up from $34.2 million\r\n\r\nto  $43.1  million.  But this  item  needs  close\r\n\r\nwatching.  It  is  based on  certain  assumptions\r\n\r\nabout   consumer   preferences  between   locally\r\n\r\nproduced  cigarettes and imported cigarettes.  It\r\n\r\nremains  to  be  seen whether  these  assumptions\r\n\r\nwill, in fact, be justified.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the  Minister quotes the cigarette industry\r\n\r\nas  an  expanding industry. And if this  industry\r\n\r\nkeeps on expanding, as it is bound to do, because\r\n\r\nthe   people   will   have   to   smoke   locally\r\n\r\nmanufactured  cigarettes which are  cheaper  than\r\n\r\nimported  cigarettes,  then  said  the  Minister,\r\n\r\n\"there may be adjustments to the tax on tobacco\".\r\n\r\nWhat   do  we  want?  Do  we  want  an  expanding\r\n\r\ncigarette  industry or do we want more money  out\r\n\r\nof tobacco revenue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance took great pains\r\n\r\nto   reiterate   the  economic  policy   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  two significant  facts  emerged\r\n\r\nfrom  this  dissertation. The  first  significant\r\n\r\nfact  is  that it is the Government's  desire  to\r\n\r\nadjust themselves in the eyes of those supporters\r\n\r\nwho  hold  the  belief that  the  Government  are\r\n\r\ncommitted to pursuing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  more  vigorous  socialist policy.  The  second\r\n\r\nsignificant fact is the Government's  anxiety  to\r\n\r\nimpress on capital that they are not so bad after\r\n\r\nall,  that  they have done a lot of  barking  but\r\n\r\nthat there will be no biting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have all along said that Singapore\r\n\r\ncannot survive without giving capital as well  as\r\n\r\nlabour  its  due  part to play  in  the  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of Singapore. And we  see  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  today  are  getting  more  and   more\r\n\r\nfriendly with capital. The Minister made  mention\r\n\r\nof  persons  in  left-wing  organisations,  trade\r\n\r\nunions, political parties and so forth, and I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  what  is  meant  by  this.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said  in no uncertain  terms  that\r\n\r\nanything  left of the P.A.P. are the  Communists.\r\n\r\nIs  the  Minister  for Finance referring  to  the\r\n\r\nCommunists? I do not think so. What I think he is\r\n\r\nreferring to is that group in the P.A.P. which is\r\n\r\nmore  left,  which is hoping for a more  vigorous\r\n\r\nsocialist policy than the group that is in  power\r\n\r\ntoday. Therefore, if there is such a group in the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. today, that group which the Minister  has\r\n\r\ndescribed as left, then the Party in power  today\r\n\r\ncould   justly  be  described  as  a   Right-wing\r\n\r\nGovernment. After all, Sir, what is Left-wing  or\r\n\r\nRight-wing? It is just relative. When one is less\r\n\r\nleft  than the left, one becomes right; and  when\r\n\r\none  is  more left than the Left-wing,  then  the\r\n\r\nLeft-wing  becomes the Right-wing. We  really  do\r\n\r\nnot  care  what the P.A.P. describes \r\n\r\nitself-Left-wing,   Right-wing,   non-Communist,   democratic\r\n\r\nsocialist  political party. We do not  care  what\r\n\r\nthey describe themselves. But we do wish to point\r\n\r\nout that what they claim they are going to do for\r\n\r\nthe economic development of Singapore is based on\r\n\r\nthe legislation introduced and brought into being\r\n\r\nby  the previous so-called Right-wing Government.\r\n\r\nIt  was  the  previous Government that introduced\r\n\r\nlegislation  to enable the present Government  to\r\n\r\nput   up  plans  for  the  industrialization   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You need money!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Tin mines!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, now I come to the tax\r\n\r\nproposals.

In  1956,   the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government,  in  conjunction  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government, proposed to introduce this\r\n\r\nreduction  in  personal  allowances  and  it  was\r\n\r\nbecause  of strong opposition not only  from  the\r\n\r\npeople,  but from the T.U.C. and from members  of\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. that  that  proposal  had   to   be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You got cold feet!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And now, Sir, it is the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment that proposes to introduce  this  kind\r\n\r\nof a tax.

It is that there should be no difference  in\r\n\r\nthe  rates of taxation between Singapore and  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  But then, Sir, that is not  correct.\r\n\r\nThere  is  already  a  difference.  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nhaving  a  55 per cent tax on personal income  as\r\n\r\nagainst 45 per cent in the Federation. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe argument that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  must  have the same rates with the Federation\r\n\r\ndoes not hold good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance for doing his utmost to encourage and\r\n\r\npromote industrial expansion. The economic \r\n\r\nwell-being of Singapore is dependent on the success of\r\n\r\nthis  plan, and it is the duty of every  citizen,\r\n\r\nbe  he rich, be he poor, be he an employer, be he\r\n\r\na worker, be he a Minister, be he an Assemblyman,\r\n\r\nto do all he can to help the Government to see to\r\n\r\nit  that  the industrial plan succeeds; otherwise\r\n\r\nSingapore  may  perish.  But  there  are  certain\r\n\r\nthings  which the Government, and the  Government\r\n\r\nonly,  can  and should do to create an atmosphere\r\n\r\nof  goodwill, confidence and tolerance. Singapore\r\n\r\nis  not  a poor country. It would have got enough\r\n\r\ncapital  to finance its own developments  had  it\r\n\r\nnot  been  for  the fact that local  capital  had\r\n\r\nflown away to Kuala Lumpur, to Hong Kong, to  the\r\n\r\nBornean  territories  and  elsewhere  since  last\r\n\r\nyear. The Government, Sir, cannot deny that  they\r\n\r\nhave  made  mistakes. And I do not  relish  using\r\n\r\nthis   forum  here  to  try  and  make  it   more\r\n\r\ndifficult-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> -for the Government. What we\r\n\r\nall  hope, Sir, is that the Ministers will profit\r\n\r\nby  their mistakes and that they will learn \r\n\r\nfast - very,  very  fast.  In  the immediate  past,  the\r\n\r\nFederation   has   been  very  friendly   towards\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  to  regain  this  very  friendly\r\n\r\nrelationship is of the utmost importance  if  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme is to  succeed.  Last\r\n\r\nyear,  the Minister in his Budget speech  touched\r\n\r\non   the  necessity  for  establishing  a  common\r\n\r\ncommodity  market with the Federation.  One  year\r\n\r\nhas  passed, and we are told that discussions are\r\n\r\nstill  continuing. One year has  passed  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister has not given this House even a hint  of\r\n\r\nsome  hope  that  there  may  be  good  news  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  One year has passed, Sir, and  during\r\n\r\nthe  course of that year, while discussions  were\r\n\r\nprogressing, the Minister had found it  necessary\r\n\r\nto  impose, for the first time, an import duty on\r\n\r\nsoap,  which  import duty directly  hits  at  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  because there is  no  soap  imported\r\n\r\ninto Singapore other than from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Federation. What do we see today? We see that\r\n\r\nonly  a  week ago, the Federation Government  has\r\n\r\nfound  it  necessary to take action to bring  the\r\n\r\nposition  back  to status quo in so  far  as  the\r\n\r\nFederation soap manufacturers are concerned. Sir,\r\n\r\nhas  the imposition of this import duty benefited\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  any way? Surely the Government  in\r\n\r\nits  talks  with the Federation Government  on  a\r\n\r\ncommon  commodity market could have  made  out  a\r\n\r\ncase  for  soap  to  be classified  as  a  common\r\n\r\ncommodity?  Or  surely the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\ncould have consulted the Minister for Finance  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  on  his proposal  to  impose  an\r\n\r\nimport  duty on soap and sound his views  on  it;\r\n\r\nand if the Minister for Finance were to hear from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance in the Federation  that\r\n\r\nany imposition of an import duty would result  in\r\n\r\nan  increased  import duty on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation, then surely there would have been  no\r\n\r\nneed  for both Governments to do something  which\r\n\r\nis  now giving the impression outside that  there\r\n\r\nwill  soon be a tariff war between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.  Surely these two  things  could\r\n\r\nhave been done. What a foolish way of going about\r\n\r\nwinning friends for Singapore!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the common commodity market is of some\r\n\r\nimportance  to  the  industrialsation   plan   of\r\n\r\nSingapore;  but  a common currency  is  of  vital\r\n\r\nimportance to Singapore and we are told that  the\r\n\r\nFederation Bank Negara will presently be  issuing\r\n\r\nand  managing  the Federation's own currency.  We\r\n\r\nwere  told  by  the Minister for Finance  in  his\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement last week that it was the  hope\r\n\r\nof  his  Government  that the currency  agreement\r\n\r\nwould continue. I would urge the Government to do\r\n\r\nmore  than hope that the currency agreement would\r\n\r\ncontinue.  They  should do  everything  in  their\r\n\r\npower  to persuade the Federation Government  not\r\n\r\nto break away from the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as time is getting short, I will therefore\r\n\r\nend my speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That the debate on the Annual Budget\r\n\r\nStatement be continued\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter 8 p.m. today and that the proceedings\r\n\r\nthereon be exempted from the provisions of\r\n\r\nStanding Order No.1 for two hours.\"-[Dr Toh Chin\r\n\r\nChye.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

On  the\r\n\r\nfirst  occasion,  he was a much younger  Minister\r\n\r\nwhen  presenting his first Budget. I am told that\r\n\r\nit  was his maiden Budget. He was also a Minister\r\n\r\nof  a young, vigorous and virile political Party.\r\n\r\nA year has passed and, as time passes, decay sets\r\n\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are hoping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is so with human beings.

It\r\n\r\nwas   quite  hesitant  in  many  places  and   it\r\n\r\nexplained why things had not happened in the  way\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  had hoped would  happen;  and  all\r\n\r\nthese things have made him a wiser man after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  year.  And  now it is a wiser Budget  on  this\r\n\r\nsecond  presentation of a P.A.P. Budget  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the first\r\n\r\nBudget, I ventured to suggest to the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  that it did not need a wizard of finance\r\n\r\nlike  himself to be able to end up that financial\r\n\r\nyear  with a surplus. He has so ended up  with  a\r\n\r\nsurplus of $37 million. I am going to suggest  to\r\n\r\nhim  again  this  time that at the  end  of  this\r\n\r\nBudget  year he will also end up with a  surplus,\r\n\r\nnot  because  he does not want to spend  money - he\r\n\r\nwants  to  very much - but because the actions  and\r\n\r\nthe policies of the P.A.P. over the past year  or\r\n\r\nso  have  been such as to curtail the functioning\r\n\r\npowers  of the P.A.P. as a Government. It is  one\r\n\r\nthing to vote the monies, but it is quite another\r\n\r\nthing to carry out the schemes: to plan them, and\r\n\r\nthen  execute them. Policies may be laid down  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  but those policies  have  to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  by  civil servants, technicians  and\r\n\r\nengineers.    The   failure   of    the    P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment - and  this  reflects  itself   in   the\r\n\r\neconomic life of Singapore - is that they have  not\r\n\r\nbeen able to manage the government of the country\r\n\r\nin  the  way they should have. The management  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  been such  that  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice has fallen down on its job, the technical\r\n\r\nside  has  fallen  down  on  its  job,  and   the\r\n\r\nprofessional side has fallen down on its job; and\r\n\r\nthat  is  why, Mr Deputy Speaker, we  have  this\r\n\r\nsurplus. Had all sections of the Government,  had\r\n\r\nall sections of the Executive been functioning as\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Ministers had hoped they would have, I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that  a large portion of  this  surplus\r\n\r\nwould  have been spent; and if it had been  spent\r\n\r\nby  the  Government, then there would  have  been\r\n\r\ngreater  prosperity in Singapore  and  a  greater\r\n\r\nfeeling of confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, governing a country is\r\n\r\na difficult matter. However brilliant the Cabinet\r\n\r\nmay  be - on  one occasion I did say that  we  have\r\n\r\nperhaps  the most brilliant Cabinet in South-East\r\n\r\nAsia - it  is not enough to be brilliant  in  one's\r\n\r\nacademic    life   or   in   one's   intellectual\r\n\r\nattainments.

To  that   extent,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  failed, not, it  would  appear,\r\n\r\nbecause  they do not want to succeed, but because\r\n\r\nthe  manner  of  approach to  the  problems,  and\r\n\r\nbecause  the  speeches made by certain  of  their\r\n\r\nMinisters  were such as to create a situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  where the people have lost confidence.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Government are seriously  interested  in\r\n\r\nknowing  why there is this feeling of uncertainty\r\n\r\nin Singapore-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> -why there is this feeling of\r\n\r\nuncertainty in Singapore - not there was but  there\r\n\r\nis - which  is  increasing from  day  to  day,  and\r\n\r\nunless the Ministers are prepared to do something\r\n\r\npositive  [Laughter] about the situation  instead\r\n\r\nof     laughing     from    their     Ministerial\r\n\r\nBenches - laughing  from their Ministerial  Benches\r\n\r\nmight  save their egos for the moment - it  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing to help Singapore one bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to put it shortly, my advice to the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is  this:  create  a  situation   of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  Singapore.

We are on the  even  more\r\n\r\ndifficult matter of trying to keep Singapore in a\r\n\r\nposition  where  it  will be able  to  appreciate\r\n\r\nculture  because, on an empty stomach,  one  does\r\n\r\nnot think of culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the economic policy of\r\n\r\nthe  Government, for the first time, has been set\r\n\r\nout  in a guarded, a right-handed and left-handed\r\n\r\nsort  of  manner,  without  going  into  it  very\r\n\r\ncarefully; what the Minister wants to say is that\r\n\r\nhe  finds  himself  in  a capitalistic  state  of\r\n\r\nsociety, that he finds he cannot alter it because\r\n\r\nof   circumstances   beyond  his   control,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore  he  has  to accept  and  to  work  the\r\n\r\nsituation as he finds it; otherwise there must be\r\n\r\neconomic  collapse and chaos. I congratulate  the\r\n\r\nMinister   on  making  that  statement   in   the\r\n\r\nAssembly, because it must have been a very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficult statement for him to make, seeing  that\r\n\r\nwhat  the  P.A.P. were seeking to  give  outside\r\n\r\nbefore   the   elections   is   something   quite\r\n\r\ndifferent.  People had expected that there  would\r\n\r\nbe  a  radical  change  in the  handling  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic situation in Singapore, but, however, it\r\n\r\nappears  that the present Government has  changed\r\n\r\nits  policy. If that is true - and it must be  true\r\n\r\nbecause the Finance Minister says it - then  it  is\r\n\r\nup  to  the  Government to see that  capital  and\r\n\r\nlabour  work  together. And if the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance says, \"I want to encourage capital\",  and\r\n\r\nhis   other   Ministers  or   Backbenchers   make\r\n\r\nstatements  in the Press - sometimes the  Ministers\r\n\r\nand  Backbenchers do this in one  day,  each  one\r\n\r\nspeaking  a different tongue and giving different\r\n\r\nviews - why,  in  one Sunday paper  there  was  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance  side  by  side  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour and one of the Backbenchers\r\n\r\n(not  all appeared in the same page but they were all in the same paper) all saying quite different\r\n\r\nthings,  one not compatible with the other -  then\r\n\r\nthat  is  not  the  sort  of  thing,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, which would engender confidence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore;   certainly  not  in  the   mercantile\r\n\r\ncommunity. If the Minister for Finance wishes  to\r\n\r\nengender  confidence in the mercantile community,\r\n\r\nthen  I  would  suggest  to  him  that  when  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  or Backbenchers make statements  which\r\n\r\nare  not compatible, he would at least see to  it\r\n\r\nthat they do not appear together in the same page\r\n\r\nof the same paper on the same day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to some of the specific proposals for\r\n\r\ntaxation  for the forthcoming year, my colleagues\r\n\r\non  this  side of the House have dealt  with  the\r\n\r\nvarious  aspects of the taxation policy  and  the\r\n\r\nvarious items on which the Government proposes to\r\n\r\nincrease taxes. There is only one item on which I\r\n\r\nwish  to  address the House this  afternoon,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  and that  is  the  question  of\r\n\r\nprofessional  taxation, \"Fees levied  on  certain\r\n\r\nprofessions\", Hansard, Vol. 14, No. 1, col. 47.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not at the moment concerned with the\r\n\r\nfees  which  the  Minister proposes  to  levy  on\r\n\r\ncertain  professions. I wish  to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nprofession of advocate and solicitor, not because\r\n\r\nI want to deal with that particularly but because\r\n\r\nI  think  that I might be able to put  my  points\r\n\r\nbetter   as   I  know  that  profession   better.\r\n\r\nOriginally the fee for admission for an  advocate\r\n\r\nand  solicitor  in  the  Colony  of  the  Straits\r\n\r\nSettlements was $500. That had been so  for  some\r\n\r\nconsiderable  time, until I think about  1948  or\r\n\r\n1949  when  it was reduced to $50.  The  fee  for\r\n\r\nadmission  of  a solicitor in the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nprior  to  1948 was, I understand, \u00a350. When  the\r\n\r\nfirst  Labour  Government or  some  other  Labour\r\n\r\nGovernment - anyway it was a Labour Government - came\r\n\r\ninto  power in the United Kingdom and formed  the\r\n\r\ngovernment, they reduced the fee from \u00a350 to  \u00a35.\r\n\r\nThe  basis of the argument was that the right  to\r\n\r\npractise a profession was the right to work,  and\r\n\r\nno government had a right to tax a man's right to\r\n\r\nwork,  to  earn  a living. It is  a  question  of\r\n\r\nprinciple - that the right to work in any system of\r\n\r\nsociety  should be free and unfettered. Now,  the\r\n\r\nMinister might well ask me, \"Why then was the fee\r\n\r\nof \u00a350 charged in the first instance?\" I think it\r\n\r\nwas because a fee of \u00a350 was felt not to be a fee\r\n\r\nfor  admission but a fee very much higher than  a\r\n\r\nlicensing fee. And because of that, it  had  been\r\n\r\nconsidered to be in the nature of a taxation, and\r\n\r\nthe fee was reduced to \u00a35. When it was reduced to\r\n\r\n\u00a35,  Singapore after some time followed suit, and\r\n\r\nreduced the fee to $50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government proposes to increase\r\n\r\nthat  $50  to  $250, and the suggestion  is  that\r\n\r\nprofessional  people can afford  it.  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in all humility,  I  say  to  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister that not all professional people\r\n\r\ncan afford to pay it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Surely you can!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I am not speaking for myself; I\r\n\r\ncertainly can afford to pay! But I would like  to\r\n\r\ninform the Deputy Prime Minister that there are a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  my professional brothers outside  who\r\n\r\nwill find it difficult to pay, particularly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  one realises that every year we are getting\r\n\r\n20   people   from   England  admitted   to   the\r\n\r\nprofession,   and  we  are  now  going   to   the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya which will give us a  number\r\n\r\nof  professional lawyers also. And when all these\r\n\r\npeople come into the legal market in Singapore, I\r\n\r\ncan  assure the Deputy Prime Minister  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  have  it  so  good.  And,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, young professional people have  not\r\n\r\ndeveloped    a   cynicism   which   Readers    in\r\n\r\nuniversities have developed; not for  some  time.\r\n\r\nThey are full of life and full of hope; they  are\r\n\r\nnot  cynical yet. But when one reads too long  in\r\n\r\nuniversities  on abstruse matters, one  tends  to\r\n\r\nbecome  cynical. And one can understand a  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  who  has  been  a  Reader  at  a\r\n\r\nuniversity  getting that way. But I think  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  good  thing. Mr Deputy Speaker,  to  get\r\n\r\ncynical in one's young age, particularly when one\r\n\r\nis a bachelor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I put the point to you that the sum of $250\r\n\r\nis  in the nature of a taxation and is not a  sum\r\n\r\nwhich  one  can equate to a fee. Over  and  above\r\n\r\nthat,  it has been suggested that this particular\r\n\r\nprofession should be called upon to pay a fee  of\r\n\r\n$500  a  year, payable every quarter at $125  per\r\n\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that a young barrister or a young solicitor\r\n\r\nwho  gets  himself enrolled in  Singapore  as  an\r\n\r\nadvocate and solicitor pays in his first year  an\r\n\r\nadmission fee of $250; and before he can practise\r\n\r\nhe  has  to  pay a quarterly fee of  $125,  which\r\n\r\nimmediately  makes the fee in the first  instance\r\n\r\n$375.  Over  and  above  that  he  has  to  incur\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in the way of acquisition  of  books\r\n\r\nand  other  material,  without  which  he  cannot\r\n\r\npractise. And this $375 is a terrible burden, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  on  young lawyers. Young  lawyers  have\r\n\r\nalready approached me and put their point to  me,\r\n\r\nand  I  speak now in this Assembly voicing  their\r\n\r\nviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister thinks that professional people\r\n\r\nare  making money - yes, some are certainly  making\r\n\r\nmoney,  but  not  all,  and certainly  not  young\r\n\r\nlawyers - might I make a suggestion to the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister that if he feels that he must go\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough  with  his  proposal for  a  professional\r\n\r\nlevy,  might I ask him not to make this  levy  on\r\n\r\nwhat we call junior advocates and solicitors;  in\r\n\r\nother  words, anybody who has practised for  less\r\n\r\nthan  seven years should be exempted from  paying\r\n\r\nthis  fee  but should be called upon to pay  this\r\n\r\nnormal  fee.

But\r\n\r\nthere  would be others not quite so fortunate  as\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister has been in his professional\r\n\r\npractice.  He  had it good because  he  got  here\r\n\r\nfirst.  But  let  me assure the  Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nthrough  you,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  very  few\r\n\r\nundergraduates  coming  out  from  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to have it as good as he had it  when  he\r\n\r\ncame  out.  And let us not forget that the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister is not an ordinary man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so much for the practice of the\r\n\r\nprofessions. But the main point I wish to make on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the professional people is that  this\r\n\r\nsocialist  Government, and a socialist government\r\n\r\nmust  encourage people to work, seems to pick  on\r\n\r\ncertain people and say to them, \"You, I am  going\r\n\r\nto  discourage. Why should you be allowed to work\r\n\r\nwithout  paying the Government a tax?\" Next  time\r\n\r\nwill  this Government charge the clerk a  fee  to\r\n\r\nply  his  work as a clerk? Where does this  stop,\r\n\r\nSir?  Once you break into the principle  that  in\r\n\r\norder  to be permitted by the State to work,  you\r\n\r\nmust  before  you work pay the  State  a  tax  in\r\n\r\nadvance.  Once  that principle is forced  through\r\n\r\nthis   Legislature  by  the  present  Government,\r\n\r\nparticularly by a socialist Government,  what  is\r\n\r\nthere to prevent any other government from coming\r\n\r\nalong and saying, \"Before you can be engaged as a\r\n\r\nlabourer, you must pay $3 or $5 per year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is not private practice.\r\n\r\nClerks do not go into private practice!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Or if a clerk wants to work for\r\n\r\nsomebody else, is the Government going to  charge\r\n\r\nhim  a  fee?

On  this\r\n\r\noccasion, we are happily agreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Friends!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, there are other aspects of this\r\n\r\nBudget which I do not wish to touch upon at  this\r\n\r\ntime  because the time to debate it  is  limited,\r\n\r\nbut I will raise them in the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we have heard quite a great deal about what\r\n\r\nmany  Members of the Opposition have called,  and\r\n\r\nespecially  what  the Member  for  Hong  Lim  has\r\n\r\nchosen to call, the so-called socialist P.A.P. We\r\n\r\nhave  also  heard  a  lot  of  rather  irrelevant\r\n\r\ndetails, especially from the Member for Hong Lim,\r\n\r\nall  on  nothing.  I  do not intend  to  go  into\r\n\r\ndetails. I will only touch on general principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all claim that the P.A.P. Budget is not the\r\n\r\nBudget of a socialist government. There are  many\r\n\r\ntypes   of  socialist  governments  or  socialist\r\n\r\nparties.  In  Singapore  alone  we  had   Lib-Soc\r\n\r\nsocialism, later on S.P.A. socialism, and we have\r\n\r\na  new addition, Hong Lim socialism. I wonder  if\r\n\r\nthey  understand what socialism really means,  or\r\n\r\nwhat  a socialist economy really entails.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot my job here this evening to teach them, but I\r\n\r\nfeel obliged to enlighten people who have been so\r\n\r\nignorant  of  the greatest - at least  one  of  the\r\n\r\ngreatest,   if  not  the  greatest - of   political\r\n\r\nphilosophies in the modern world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me tell them how a socialist\r\n\r\ngovernment  goes  about the socialisation  of  an\r\n\r\neconomy that is essentially and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbasically capitalistic, especially in a  backward\r\n\r\nand under-developed semi-independent country like\r\n\r\nSingapore. For the benefit of the Members of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  the basis of Socialist  construction\r\n\r\nis  industrialisation. It should be plain even to\r\n\r\npeople  who  know  nothing about  economics  that\r\n\r\nindustrialisation   and   the   construction   of\r\n\r\nfactories  mean more jobs and more  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  employment for the people, especially so  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  which  has  limited  resources  and  a\r\n\r\nrapidly  increasing  population  which  has  been\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  \"explosive\". You may notice,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  we  have recently held our family  planning\r\n\r\ncampaign  and,  of  course, the industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme of the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back, however, how do these countries\r\n\r\nembark  on  industrialisation?  Let  us  look  at\r\n\r\nhistory  a  little. Some countries  industrialise\r\n\r\nthrough  plunder and the exploitation of colonies\r\n\r\nthrough  decades and for ages. There  are  others\r\n\r\nthat  industrialise through the winning  of  wars\r\n\r\nand  the  exacting of heavy reparations from  the\r\n\r\ndefeated   enemies.  Still  others  industrialise\r\n\r\nthrough  leases  or  concessions  and  loans   in\r\n\r\nenslaving terms. All this, Sir, Singapore  cannot\r\n\r\ndo.  It  leaves  only  for  us  to  go  back   to\r\n\r\nindustrialisation through our own efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how do Socialist countries industrialise\r\n\r\nthrough  their own efforts? To industrialise  you\r\n\r\nhave first of all to need capital. And how do  we\r\n\r\nget  that  capital? Let us look around again  and\r\n\r\nfind  out  how  certain Socialist  countries  get\r\n\r\ntheir  capital.  The Communist countries  acquire\r\n\r\ntheir  capital in various ways. First,  there  is\r\n\r\nthe   method  of  expropriation  of   lands   and\r\n\r\nproperties  and  the other means  of  production.\r\n\r\nThen  there  is the method of nationalisation  of\r\n\r\nkey industries and other dictatorial methods that\r\n\r\nwill  provoke stubborn resistance or  even  armed\r\n\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the benefit of the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\n(unfortunately  he  is  not  here),  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialist  Government. It is not only a Socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment but also a Government that believes in\r\n\r\nconstitutional   advance  through   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  In other words, the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nis  a Government that believes in and carries out\r\n\r\ndemocratic  Socialism. What do we do  in  such  a\r\n\r\ncase?  Can  we go about dictatorially  and  start\r\n\r\nnationalisation  and  expropriation  of  all  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists?  Is that what some  of  the  Members\r\n\r\nopposite  want? Do they know what that means?  It\r\n\r\nwill  only mean armed revolution, and the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nas we have very often repeated, abhors violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the only alternative to the P.A.P. Socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment is to go about acquiring capital in  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  and constitutional way. Some  of  the\r\n\r\nways   are  by  saving  and  the  husbanding   of\r\n\r\nresources, or by ensuring that there is no  waste\r\n\r\nand  dissipation of whatever resources there  may\r\n\r\nbe, or by channelling these resources into useful\r\n\r\nand  purposeful  projects,  and,  of  course,  by\r\n\r\ncalling  for  local loans. So in the  context  of\r\n\r\nSingapore whose economy is entrepot and basically\r\n\r\ncapitalistic,  and whose economy is  also  linked\r\n\r\nwith  capitalist  countries of the  Western  bloc\r\n\r\nthrough   external  trade,  it   becomes   doubly\r\n\r\ndifficult for a Socialist Government to go  about\r\n\r\nsocialising such an economy. Previous Governments\r\n\r\nnever did anything in the way of making provision\r\n\r\nfor   the   employment  of  our  fast   expanding\r\n\r\npopulation that come out from our schools. It has\r\n\r\nto  be left to the P.A.P. Government to plan  for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  so that  all  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   may   have  a   chance   of   gainful\r\n\r\nemployment. As has often been repeated, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nfruits  of  toil never fall down from heaven.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  work  hard and toil for whatever  fruit\r\n\r\nthat we can get. The P.A.P. Government is at  the\r\n\r\npresent  moment  embarking on  a  most  difficult\r\n\r\nexperiment  of democratic Socialism in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  should be the aim and hope of each and  every\r\n\r\none of us to see this experiment succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Opposition Members have said that\r\n\r\nwe  go for class ideology. Some of them say  that\r\n\r\nwe  are not Socialists, not left enough. Let them\r\n\r\nall  realise  that we, as democratic  Socialists,\r\n\r\nare  working  democratically and constitutionally\r\n\r\nto lay a foundation for the final objective of  a\r\n\r\nsociety  that  will give the maximum satisfaction\r\n\r\nto all our cultural and material requirements. In\r\n\r\nour  present Budget, it is absolutely untrue that\r\n\r\nthe  poor has been taxed. Anyone who is worth his\r\n\r\nsalt knows that the introduction of earned income\r\n\r\nis a special move to help the working man. Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Budget unreservedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  second  Budget presented  by  the People's  Action Party Government, and framed  in\r\n\r\nthe  light  of the last Government's  experience.\r\n\r\nYou  will remember, Sir, that the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nin  his speech during the debate on the Yang \r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara's  Speech, described  the  second\r\n\r\nyear of office of the P.A.P. Government as a year\r\n\r\nof  construction. This fact is well reflected  in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget which was presented to this  Assembly\r\n\r\nby the Minister for Finance last week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget makes provision for considerable\r\n\r\nexpansion  in  the field of social  services  and\r\n\r\nindustrial development. Sir, it can be seen  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government  is  resolved  to  pursue\r\n\r\nvigorously  its  policy of industrial  expansion.\r\n\r\nIndustrialisation  is  for  Singapore  the   only\r\n\r\navailable    means   of   providing    employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  for our growing young  population.\r\n\r\nThe  economic  basis  of  Singapore  has  to   be\r\n\r\nmodified from that of a commercial entrepot to an\r\n\r\nindustrial  one. Even with the rate of  expansion\r\n\r\nwhich    can    be   expected   in    Singapore's\r\n\r\ninternational trade, there will not be enough  of\r\n\r\nnew   jobs   for  the  vast  numbers   of   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are  coming  into  the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket year by year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary planning for a five-year\r\n\r\ndevelopment plan is now going on in the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Finance, and we can expect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto see a detailed plan published early in the new\r\n\r\nyear.  We  hope,  Sir, that  with  the  continued\r\n\r\nstability   in   Singapore   under   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  more and more foreign  capital  will\r\n\r\nfind  its  way into Singapore and supplement  our\r\n\r\nown efforts at industrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side by side with our proposals to bring about\r\n\r\nan  industrial economy, the Government will  also\r\n\r\nhave  to  take  into  account  the  necessity  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  and  improve the  highest  standard  of\r\n\r\nsocial services available for our people, and the\r\n\r\nprogramme  both  in the fields of  education  and\r\n\r\nhealth  is enormous. The funds available  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Sir,  have to  be  well  apportioned\r\n\r\namong the departments of Government which provide\r\n\r\nthese social services. The continued expansion of\r\n\r\neducational  facilities,  building  schools   and\r\n\r\nemploying  teachers and the expansion  of  health\r\n\r\nservices in the rural and city areas call  for  a\r\n\r\nhigh rate of capital investment. The expansion of\r\n\r\nthese facilities, Sir, also makes heavy demand on\r\n\r\nthe existing Government machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen from the Budget that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  almost  achieved  its   aim   of\r\n\r\nabolishing   the   cumbersome  local   government\r\n\r\nmachinery and incorporating most of the functions\r\n\r\nof  the  former  City Council  into  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It can be expected, Sir,  that  when\r\n\r\nthis  process  of  integration is  completed,  it\r\n\r\nwould facilitate the provision of social services\r\n\r\nto the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also noticed, Mr Speaker, that during\r\n\r\nthe  last  twelve months the Government has  made\r\n\r\nconsiderable   progress   in   regard   to    the\r\n\r\norganisation   of  community  associations.   The\r\n\r\nPeople's Association has now co-ordinated  social\r\n\r\nservices   and   is   also   taking   over    the\r\n\r\nadministration of community centres.  As  regards\r\n\r\npublic assistance, we hope that as more and  more\r\n\r\njobs  become  available to  our  population,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can bring about some reduction in  the\r\n\r\namount of money that is now being spent to assist\r\n\r\nthe unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is obvious that to bring about the\r\n\r\nproposed expansion in the spheres of industry and\r\n\r\nsocial services, certain adjustments will have to\r\n\r\nbe made to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting  tax  structure.  Every  proposal,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhich  was presented by the Minister for  Finance has  been  well received. The additional  revenue\r\n\r\nwhich  is required to implement our programme  of\r\n\r\nexpansion  will have to come from  these  revenue\r\n\r\nproposals. As the Minister has pointed out,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  still  remain one of the most  lightly  taxed\r\n\r\ncountries in the world. The Government has  given\r\n\r\nconsideration  to the necessity of spreading  out\r\n\r\nthe  effects  of these new taxes as equitably  as\r\n\r\npossible.  As  a  Socialist Government,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nbelieve in the principle that the heaviest burden\r\n\r\nmust rest on the strongest shoulders. At the same\r\n\r\ntime, we should be on our guard. Will these taxes\r\n\r\nin  any way kill the incentive without which  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment plans cannot proceed? As  the  result\r\n\r\nof  the  stringent economic policy of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment during the last 12 months, we are  now\r\n\r\nin  the  happy  position where the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  indicated  the  readiness  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to consider the question of  restoring\r\n\r\nin  part  the variable allowances which were  cut\r\n\r\nsoon  after we took office. I have no doubt, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  as  Singapore proceeds along  the  road  to\r\n\r\nprosperity, our civil servants will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nget  back as much of their variable allowance  as\r\n\r\nthe finances of the State would permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget, Sir, presents yet another milestone\r\n\r\nin   the  P.A.P.  Government's  progress  towards\r\n\r\nachieving its long-term objective, which was made\r\n\r\npublic  in  our  election manifesto.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the  present  Government   to\r\n\r\nensure that during the next 3\u00bd years, they will\r\n\r\nhave  made some progress towards achieving a more\r\n\r\nequal  and just society. The people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nSir,  I am sure, would not grudge such sacrifices\r\n\r\nand  such  extra effort as would be  required  of\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I fully support the\r\n\r\nGovernment's financial policy as presented by the Minister for Finance. A genuine government is one\r\n\r\nthat presents facts to the people and not put  in\r\n\r\nsomething  which  is ambiguous; neither  does  it\r\n\r\ngive an estimate which is full of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheories, because the Government side is not full\r\n\r\nof  theoreticians  as claimed by  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nside. They also claimed to be Socialists. But  we\r\n\r\ndo not know what kind of socialists they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have heard a lot of things, especially from those Members who have put up\r\n\r\nmany  questions asking for elucidation  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance. There are also  those  who\r\n\r\nattack  us. But, unfortunately, when we start  to\r\n\r\ngive  elucidation, we find that the seats on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition side are empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not wish to speak at length on this matter, because what has been expressed by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance is clear. But  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  touch on the subject mentioned  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Mountbatten relating to  the  things\r\n\r\nthat  were  perpetrated by  the  ex-Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development regarding  the  S.I.T.  She\r\n\r\nsaid  that  had  the  former  Minister  not  been\r\n\r\nexpelled  the mismanagement would have  continued\r\n\r\nuntil today. This is most misleading, because the\r\n\r\nGovernment is aware of it. The Singapore  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board was established in January\r\n\r\nthis  year, a few months before the expulsion  of\r\n\r\nthe  ex-Minister  for National Development.  This\r\n\r\nindicates that the Government is always aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of the people of  Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  will always do all it can in its  power\r\n\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I should not mention this matter, but the Member for Kampong Kembangan has in his\r\n\r\nreview   of   the   Government   economising   on\r\n\r\nexpenditure taken the opportunity to challenge or\r\n\r\naccuse the P.A.P. Government. He has stated  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. organ challenged U.M.N.O. Members  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly to resign their seats and  contest\r\n\r\nthe     by-elections    in    their    respective\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  This  is  most  confusing,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. We have never issued a challenge to\r\n\r\nanybody, because we know that it is no use.  What\r\n\r\nactually happened is that the U.M.N.O. Members in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly were challenged by other  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nmembers,  who  were faithful to the directive  of\r\n\r\nTunku  Abdul  Rahman, the President of  U.M.N.O.,\r\n\r\nMalaya.   The   domestic  crisis   in   U.M.N.O.,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  should  not  be  mixed  up  with  the\r\n\r\naffairs of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  also seized the opportunity,  when  he\r\n\r\ntouched  on the estimated budget for the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Culture, to sing old tunes regarding what took\r\n\r\nplace between myself and the Minister for Health.\r\n\r\nActually, after the incident, I was approached by\r\n\r\na  number  of officials, especially the President\r\n\r\nof   the  Literary  and  Language  Congress,  who\r\n\r\nexpressed their regret at the Member for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  touching on the question  of  culture,\r\n\r\nbecause they felt that cultural matters should be\r\n\r\nleft to cultural bodies and organisations to deal\r\n\r\nwith  and should be looked after by those  people\r\n\r\nwho   are  really  in  the  know  about  cultural\r\n\r\nmatters.  Mr  Speaker, the  Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan said that the Government, in the course\r\n\r\nof  carrying out cultural works, should force the\r\n\r\npeople to practise a Malayan culture based on the\r\n\r\nconcept   of  the  Government.  It  is  not   our\r\n\r\nintention to force something on anybody. But  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of a government is to  give  every\r\n\r\nencouragement to the people so that they may have\r\n\r\nself-respect for the various cultures that are to\r\n\r\nbe found in Singapore, with a view to creating  a\r\n\r\nMalayan culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan also accused\r\n\r\nthe  Government of ignoring the special  position\r\n\r\nof  the  Malays  as embodied in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  I  feel I can ask  this  question:\r\n\r\nDuring the four years of the coalition Government\r\n\r\nled  by  Tun Lim Yew Hock and his colleagues,  to\r\n\r\nwhat  extent had they gone to help the Malays  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with  the efforts carried  out  by  the\r\n\r\nsocialist P.A.P. Government towards the Malays? I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to reiterate that the memorandum  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  Education Council, submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government  of  U.M.N.O.,  M.C.A. and\r\n\r\nLabour  Front in 1950, was put into cold  storage\r\n\r\nuntil  1957. The P.A.P. Government never practise\r\n\r\nthat  method  with  reference to  any  particular\r\n\r\ndemand submitted by the Malays, because it is our\r\n\r\npolicy  to give all assistance to the Malays  who\r\n\r\nhave    been   ignored   by   previous   colonial\r\n\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have observed that many\r\n\r\nOpposition Members have moved amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nHead, Ministry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation.  I  have  no doubt that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned could explain the position. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong  Kembangan said that the  Government\r\n\r\nprovided  low-cost houses at the expense  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy  of the Malays. Mr Speaker, the question\r\n\r\nof  drawing up a plan for the economic uplift  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malays is not an easy task. Mr Speaker, our\r\n\r\nhelp  to  the  Malays  is based  on  giving  them\r\n\r\neducation,  because it is through education  that\r\n\r\ntheir  economic  and  living  standards  will  be\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that my brief elucidation will clear up\r\n\r\nthe  confusion  caused by persons in  responsible\r\n\r\npositions who make political capital out  of  the\r\n\r\nso-called  special  position of  the  Malays,  as\r\n\r\nthough  the present Government is neglecting  the\r\n\r\nConstitution. We believe in deeds, and I am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  what we have done for the Malays will prove\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier this evening the House\r\n\r\nwas  given  a  very  short entertainment  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanglin when in his speech in which he\r\n\r\nfought  strongly for the partial  restitution  of\r\n\r\nvariable  allowances for the civil  servants  and\r\n\r\naided teachers, he made the statement that should\r\n\r\nhe  get  a restitution he would donate it to  the\r\n\r\nunemployed. It is, I think, public news that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin will have retired  from  the\r\n\r\neducation service in three weeks' time;  so  that\r\n\r\nit  is  very likely that he will not receive  any\r\n\r\npartial  restitution  of the  variable  allowance\r\n\r\nbecause  it  will  only  be  effective  in  1961.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he will be making a contribution which\r\n\r\nwould not-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nable to cut down its expenditure - especially  the\r\n\r\nannually  recurrent expenditure for a  number  of\r\n\r\nsocial  services for the State - that sum of  money\r\n\r\nwhich  is available should not be frittered  away\r\n\r\nbut should be set aside either to reserves or  be\r\n\r\nploughed  back  for the purpose  of  development,\r\n\r\nthat  is, for the future prosperity of the State.\r\n\r\nSo  if  there have been surpluses for  the  years\r\n\r\n1959  and  1960,  these sums of  money  would  be\r\n\r\nneeded for the industrialisation programme of the\r\n\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this evening, the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nwas talking loudly about company tax, and he went\r\n\r\neven  as  far as to say that the present  company\r\n\r\ntax  was  no tax at all. You will remember,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  I stood up and put a question to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong  Lim - who  is not in the  House  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment -  whether  as a practising  accountant  he\r\n\r\nseriously meant that companies, in fact,  do  not\r\n\r\npay tax. His answer, which is typical of him, was\r\n\r\na  passing insinuation that I did not know what I\r\n\r\nwas talking about. I do not profess, Sir, to be a\r\n\r\npractising  accountant, but  I  think  I  know  a\r\n\r\nlittle about accounts and income tax laws.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  the Member for Hong Lim is not  quite  an\r\n\r\naccountant and I fear for the clients who  go  to\r\n\r\nhim  for such service if he cannot interpret  the\r\n\r\nincome  tax  law for their benefit. According  to\r\n\r\nthe Laws of the State, Chapter 166 on Income Tax,\r\n\r\nPart  XIII - Rates of Tax, Rights of Deduction  and\r\n\r\nAllowances for Tax Charged, section 43 states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of section 40 of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance there shall be levied and paid for each\r\n\r\nyear of assessment upon the chargeable income of-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) every company tax at the rate of forty per\r\n\r\ncentum  on  every dollar of  the  chargeable\r\n\r\nincome thereof.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  happens  is  this. Before arriving  at  the\r\n\r\npayment  of dividends, a company will be  charged\r\n\r\ntax on its profits. Let us say that a company has\r\n\r\nmade a profit of a million dollars; then the  tax\r\n\r\nwould be $400,000. It is left to the company then\r\n\r\nto  decide on the rate of dividend which it would\r\n\r\nlike to pay to its shareholders. I am afraid that\r\n\r\nthe Member for Hong Lim has somehow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngot   confused  with  the  question  of  tax   on\r\n\r\ndividends  which  the  company  is  permitted  to\r\n\r\ndeduct  but which it will hold in trust  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  That is referred to in  section  44,\r\n\r\nthe  next  section  to the section  I  have  just\r\n\r\nquoted, where it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every company which is resident in Singapore\r\n\r\nshall  be  entitled to deduct from the amount  of\r\n\r\nany  dividend paid to any shareholder tax at  the\r\n\r\nrate  of forty per centum on every dollar of such\r\n\r\ndividend.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, if the company should make  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars  profit,  it  is  taxed  to  the  sum  of\r\n\r\n$400,000.  If  the company wishes  to  declare  a\r\n\r\ndividend  equivalent, say,  to  $100,000  to  its\r\n\r\nshareholders, then it is entitled to pay out  the\r\n\r\nnet  sixty per cent and hold back forty per  cent\r\n\r\nfor   which  it  will  have  to  account  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment under section 44 (3) which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`At the end of each year of assessment every\r\n\r\nsuch  company  shall render to the Comptroller  a\r\n\r\nstatement  in  such form as the  Comptroller  may\r\n\r\ndirect, showing the total amount of the tax which\r\n\r\nhas been deducted from all dividends...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  this  sum is accountable to the Comptroller.\r\n\r\nTherefore, far from not knowing what I am talking\r\n\r\nabout,  I am afraid that the Member for Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nwho  professes to be an accountant does not  know\r\n\r\nwhat he is talking about. May I now refer to page\r\n\r\n3   of  the  Annual  Report  of  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment,  1958,  which  was  tabled  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly on 30th December, 1959?

I think I will\r\n\r\nhave  to  request my colleague the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  to look into the accounts of the clients\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Hong Lim as to  whether  they\r\n\r\nhave been fiddled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the point raised by the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Hong  Lim - who  is  absent - on   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment plan of the Ministry of Education  as\r\n\r\nbeing  a  Ministry without any plan  at  all.  He\r\n\r\nmentioned the fact that in January 1960, when  he\r\n\r\nwas  the  Minister for National  Development,  he\r\n\r\nasked  the  Director of Public  Works  about  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plan of the Ministry  of  Education,\r\n\r\nand  he  got an answer that there was  none.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, this gives me an opportunity to say\r\n\r\na   few  words  about  the  former  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development. Soon  after  I  came  into\r\n\r\noffice,  I  got wind of his tendency to  what  is\r\n\r\ncalled  \"a  land  grab\".  As  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nNational  Development, he was in  charge  of  the\r\n\r\nLand Office and construction, and every available\r\n\r\npiece  of  land was grabbed by his department  of\r\n\r\ncourse   for  the  purpose  of  building  houses,\r\n\r\nbecause  he  was also in charge of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust.  Well, the  people  concerned\r\n\r\nwith  an  aided  school known as  St.  Margaret's\r\n\r\nSchool came to see me. They said that acquisition\r\n\r\nof a piece of land which was allotted to them for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of building a new school  had  been\r\n\r\nturned  down  by the S.I.T. on the  pretext  that\r\n\r\nthat  land  was  to be used for the  building  of\r\n\r\nhouses. I decided not to take action then because\r\n\r\nthis  was land which was partly to be used  as  a\r\n\r\nplaying  field, and I felt that perhaps  the \r\n\r\nex-Minister  for  National  Development  was  really\r\n\r\ndesperately in need of land. After a few  months,\r\n\r\nI  had another complaint from my officials that a\r\n\r\npiece  of  land in Selegie Road/Short Street  was\r\n\r\nbeing  frozen  also for the purpose  of  building\r\n\r\nflats. This time I decided to take action, and  I\r\n\r\nhad  a reply from his junior officer. In fact,  I\r\n\r\nwrote  a  personal letter to the ex-Minister  and\r\n\r\nasked  him  for a discussion, and this supposedly\r\n\r\ncolleague of mine did not even have the  courtesy\r\n\r\nto  reply to my letter but instructed his  junior\r\n\r\nofficer  to write to me to say that such a  thing\r\n\r\ndid  not  take place. A few months later,  I  had\r\n\r\noccasion  to  tick him off over the telephone.  I\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he should write a letter of  apology,\r\n\r\nwhich  he did. It just shows that If there was  a\r\n\r\nlack  of  building activity during the time  when\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Hong Lim was the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  it  was due to his stranglehold  on\r\n\r\nevery  Ministry except his own, that there should\r\n\r\nbe  nothing  coming  up except  what  he  thought\r\n\r\nshould  be built. For example, he had a  fanciful\r\n\r\nidea of building $450 million worth of houses for\r\n\r\nthe  State  of Singapore. That was  all  a \r\n\r\npipe-dream. The statement was unauthorised and he  did\r\n\r\nnot  even have the decency and the courage to say\r\n\r\nthat  he  released  it. Instead,  he  blamed  the\r\n\r\npressmen  for  having got something  out  of  him\r\n\r\nwithout  authority. Far from there being no  plan\r\n\r\nfor  the  development  of  schools,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nconcerted   drive,  as  stated  in   the   Budget\r\n\r\nStatement made by the Minister for Finance,  that\r\n\r\nthe  1961 Development Plan is in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe   Five-Year   Development  Plan   which   all\r\n\r\nMinistries were asked to bring together before-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> No, I will not give way. We\r\n\r\nare now building schools with the co-operation of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of National Development. It was not\r\n\r\nso  in  the past. We never got that in the  past.\r\n\r\nThe  Plan envisages 19 new schools each year:  14\r\n\r\nprimary  and 5 secondary schools. We go according\r\n\r\nto  plan  and  we work in co-operation  with  one\r\n\r\nanother - no  more  the  failure  nor  the   dismal\r\n\r\nexhibition of the Member for Hong Lim when he was\r\n\r\nthe Minister for National Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he is also not here. He  spoke  on\r\n\r\nthe  new  tax  which the Government  proposes  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  for  the professional workers  and  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  right  to  work  should  not  be\r\n\r\nfettered. The Budget of this Government for  1961\r\n\r\ndoes take into account the socialist principle of\r\n\r\nencouraging  every  citizen  to  work   for   his\r\n\r\nlivelihood.  That is why for this  year  we  have\r\n\r\nintroduced a 20 per cent relief for earned income\r\n\r\nup to a maximum of $1,000. This will take care of\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of  the salaried workers  who,  as\r\n\r\nsingle persons, will get the equivalent of $5,000\r\n\r\nper annum. And\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat, I think, takes into account the majority of\r\n\r\nthose  who are in the lower-middle class  outside\r\n\r\nthe net for income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, as I have said\r\n\r\nearlier on when commenting on what the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  had  to  say, the Government  is  to  be\r\n\r\njudged not on a year-to-year Budget alone but  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time on its development plans  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  It will be seen that our plan  envisages\r\n\r\nthe expenditure of $876 million, vide Hansard  of\r\n\r\n29th November, 1960, Volume 14 No. 1, column  41.\r\n\r\nIt is the intention of the Government to spend as\r\n\r\ncapital  expenditure the fantastic  sum  of  $876\r\n\r\nmillion,  of which $500 million will be from  our\r\n\r\nown  efforts, and we hope to bridge  the  gap  of\r\n\r\n$376  million  either  from  overseas  loans   or\r\n\r\nassistance from overseas. It is only by ploughing\r\n\r\nback all that we have (all our surpluses) that we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to build a base  for  the  future\r\n\r\nprosperity  of the State. And therefore  I  fully\r\n\r\nsupport the Budget proposed by my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the last few hours we\r\n\r\nhave   had  different  views  expressed  by   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  about the Budget policy  outlined  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance. For example, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin thinks that the Budget is too  Left,\r\n\r\nthat  it  stresses too much on class  issues  and\r\n\r\nthat   it  holds  no  lolly  for  the  well-to-do\r\n\r\ngentlemen  with  whom  obviously  he   has   been\r\n\r\nhobnobbing  and whose views have been transmitted\r\n\r\nto us during the course of his speech. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill takes a rather confused  view.  On\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand,  he thinks we are  not  socialist\r\n\r\nenough, and on the other hand, he thinks  we  are\r\n\r\ntoo  socialistic in our approach and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nfrightened off our investors. The Member for  Joo\r\n\r\nChiat  also  thinks that this is not a  socialist\r\n\r\nBudget.   The  Member  for  Farrer  Park,   after\r\n\r\ncongratulating  the  Minister  for  Finance   for\r\n\r\nproducing an excellent Budget, goes on to express\r\n\r\ndoubts  about the validity of some of  the  taxes\r\n\r\nwhich have been imposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can sympathise with the hon. Members\r\n\r\nopposite over their predicament when dealing with\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  policy outlined by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.  They have to play a role which  becomes\r\n\r\nincreasingly  awkward  and  tedious   with   each\r\n\r\npassing  day.  Their predicament  is  this:  they\r\n\r\ntried  very hard before the elections to convince\r\n\r\nthe  people that the P.A.P. Government must bring\r\n\r\nterror,  chaos, strife, and economic misery,  and\r\n\r\nthat  there must be a gradual decline of business\r\n\r\nand trade. That was what they solemnly stated  in\r\n\r\nthe newspapers. They swore to the electorate that\r\n\r\nif they elected a P.A.P. Government, these things\r\n\r\nmust  come  about. Fortunately the  converse  has\r\n\r\nbeen true. They know it, as you can judge by  the\r\n\r\ndemeanour of the Opposition Members, who  do  not\r\n\r\nlook   frightened  or  impoverished,   and   they\r\n\r\ncertainly look with confidence to the future. But\r\n\r\npolitically   they   have   to   maintain    this\r\n\r\npretence - that  there must be  chaos,  oppression,\r\n\r\nand  terror. So the less true the myth that  they\r\n\r\npropagated during the elections becomes, the more\r\n\r\ndifficult  it  is for them to try to  whip  up  a\r\n\r\nfeeling  of  pretence that there is  uncertainty,\r\n\r\nand  oppression  and  that the  people  are  more\r\n\r\nmiserable  than they were before. So  today  they\r\n\r\nhave tried to present the Budget as an oppressive\r\n\r\nand unfair one. But is it oppressive or unfair?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance made it quite\r\n\r\nclear   in   his   Budget  statement   that,   in\r\n\r\nformulating its Budget, the P.A.P. Government has\r\n\r\ncertain social and political purposes behind  it.\r\n\r\nBriefly,  these  revolve  around  two  questions.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the Budget is formulated with a  view  to\r\n\r\nexpanding  the economy, and, secondly,  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  greater social and economic justice. These\r\n\r\nare  the two social goals aimed at in the  Budget\r\n\r\npolicy  outlined by the Minister.  In  the  past,\r\n\r\nthere  have  been  governments  which  had   also\r\n\r\ndeclared these aims, but because they were either\r\n\r\ncontrolled   by   colonial   officials   or   - by\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of vested interests, the  Budgets\r\n\r\nthat   they   designed - though  they  might   have\r\n\r\nproclaimed  admirable intentions - were,  in  fact,\r\n\r\ndeigned to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprotect the interests of those classes which  had\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the government. Nobody can  say  that\r\n\r\nthis   Government  has  either  colonial   vested\r\n\r\ninterests  or  representatives of wealth  in  its\r\n\r\nmidst,  and therefore we have no reason to defend\r\n\r\nthe  interests either of colonialism or of vested\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, that not many of us like to pay\r\n\r\ntax.  If  we could avoid paying taxes,  we  would\r\n\r\ncertainly try to do so. But the first question to\r\n\r\nask here is are these taxes necessary? The answer\r\n\r\nto  that  question will depend on what  uses  the\r\n\r\ntaxes  would be put to. If we have an inefficient\r\n\r\ngovernment  or a government composed of  men  who\r\n\r\nare  more interested in filling their pockets and\r\n\r\nsetting  up  enterprises in other  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld,  or  men who work for and in the interests\r\n\r\nof  a  privileged minority, then all taxes become\r\n\r\noppressive  because  they  would  be   used   for\r\n\r\nstrengthening   an   inefficient,   corrupt   and\r\n\r\nreactionary government. But where taxes are  used\r\n\r\nresponsibly to expand the economy, to  make  life\r\n\r\nbetter for the people, to ensure a more equitable\r\n\r\ndistribution of wealth and opportunities for  the\r\n\r\npeople,  then taxes cease to be an imposition  on\r\n\r\nthe  people because the taxes will eventually  be\r\n\r\nreturned  to  the  people in  the  form  of  more\r\n\r\nschools,  more hospitals, better social services,\r\n\r\nan  expanding economy, and opportunities for more\r\n\r\njobs.  Therefore, the thing to do is not  to  ask\r\n\r\nwhether the tax is good or bad, but to judge  the\r\n\r\ngoodness or badness of the tax by asking to  what\r\n\r\nuse  would the money collected from taxes be put.\r\n\r\nAre  they going to be spent on enriching selected\r\n\r\nindividuals,   either  inside  or   outside   the\r\n\r\ngovernment, or is the money going to be  used  to\r\n\r\nenrich  the material and cultural wealth  of  the\r\n\r\npeople?  But  I  know, Sir, that  the  Opposition\r\n\r\ncannot afford to ask these questions because,  if\r\n\r\nthey  have regard for facts, then they would know\r\n\r\nthat  these  monies are going to  be  transformed\r\n\r\ninto  services for the people. But they  have  to\r\n\r\nkeep  up this pretence of increasing misery under\r\n\r\na socialist government, and therefore they try to\r\n\r\nexploit this natural disinclination of the people\r\n\r\nnot  to want to pay more taxes than is necessary.\r\n\r\nSir, they might\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay  that  these taxes are unnecessary  and  that\r\n\r\nthere is no need for these taxes; but during  the\r\n\r\ncourse of the next year the same people will  get\r\n\r\nup  and say, \"What is the Government doing  about\r\n\r\nbuilding  more schools?\"; \"What is the Government\r\n\r\ndoing  about building more hospitals?\"; \"What  is\r\n\r\nthe  Government doing about providing more jobs?\"\r\n\r\nThe  Government cannot produce all these by  just\r\n\r\nintroducing a Bill and saying that this Bill will\r\n\r\nnot  cost  the taxpayer any money.  To  do  these\r\n\r\nthings,  Government  needs revenue,  and  revenue\r\n\r\ndoes not come out of the pockets of a government.\r\n\r\nIt has no private coffers, but it comes by way of\r\n\r\ntaxation.  And  therefore, even long  before  the\r\n\r\nelections,  the P.A.P. has taken  the  view  that\r\n\r\nprosperity,  expansion, and a better life  cannot\r\n\r\ncome  about  under the slogan of  \"prosperity  by\r\n\r\nshaking  legs\". If you want prosperity, you  must\r\n\r\nwork  for  it. In fact, just before the elections\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. outlined its economic  proposals  in\r\n\r\nwhich it is frankly stated: (a) that socialism is\r\n\r\nnot   possible  under  the  present  setup,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore all the doubts that have been expressed\r\n\r\nabout  this policy, that it is not 100  per  cent\r\n\r\nsocialist, are groundless. We have never  claimed\r\n\r\nit  to be 100 per cent socialist. All we said was\r\n\r\nthat  we  shall try to do what we can to  rectify\r\n\r\nsuch  injustices as may exist within the  present\r\n\r\nframework.  And  that  is all  that  this  Budget\r\n\r\nclaims to do. And (b) that economic expansion and\r\n\r\nreconstruction   in   Singapore   would    entail\r\n\r\nsacrifices on the part of everyone, including the\r\n\r\nworkers. When that was published, I remember some\r\n\r\nof  the  newspapers and Members of the Opposition\r\n\r\nmaking  capital out of it. In fact, a  leader  of\r\n\r\none  Party who is no longer represented  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  gave  a  long interview  to  the  Press\r\n\r\nwherein  he said, \"This shows that the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nnot  fit to be a government because it enunciated\r\n\r\nan  economic policy of what he called `policy  of\r\n\r\ndesperation'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We knew, and we frankly stated, that if we\r\n\r\nwanted   prosperity,  everybody   had   to   make\r\n\r\nsacrifices, from the wealthiest down to even  the\r\n\r\nworker.  In the past, Singapore had been  built\r\n\r\non   the  sacrifices  of  many  people,  but  the\r\n\r\nmajority who made the sacrifices reaped only a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmall  fraction of the benefits, and  the  people\r\n\r\nwho  really benefited out of the sacrifices  made\r\n\r\nby  the  community as a whole were the  minority.\r\n\r\nBut  under  the  P.A.P.  Government,  unlike  the\r\n\r\nprevious government, certainly this Budget  tries\r\n\r\nto  put forward the view that if it is prosperity\r\n\r\nthat  is  wanted, then everybody has to pay;  and\r\n\r\nthe  sacrifice  will be distributed  fairly - those\r\n\r\nwho  are  better  off  will  have  to  make  more\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  the community's  coffers,  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  are not well off, less so. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is  very  easy  to say,  \"Why  put  up  these\r\n\r\ntaxes?\",  \"Why not go without taxes?\".  In  fact,\r\n\r\nSir,  if  this  Government  were  mad,  it  could\r\n\r\nperhaps  follow the implications or some  of  the\r\n\r\nsuggestions put forward, including those  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim who has said that taxes  are\r\n\r\nunnecessary.  We could say that we will  dispense\r\n\r\nwith  all taxes for three or four years; that  we\r\n\r\ncan  all  make  whoopee, and perhaps  we  can  be\r\n\r\nreturned  under conditions where it will  not  be\r\n\r\nnecessary for, and perhaps there will not be,  an\r\n\r\nOpposition.  We  could live on  our  capital;  we\r\n\r\ncould   disburse  rewards;  increase  everybody's\r\n\r\nsalaries;  free  housing,  free  schooling,  free\r\n\r\nclothes, and even free food. That sort of  policy\r\n\r\nis not one which the P.A.P. is willing to follow,\r\n\r\nbecause we know that that will eventually end  in\r\n\r\nmisery  and  starvation. And all the things  that\r\n\r\nwould  come  about as implied by  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nwould be a situation of terror and starvation and\r\n\r\nmisery. We have always stated quite frankly  that\r\n\r\nevery advance is made through the efforts of  the\r\n\r\npeople, and these efforts include sacrifices  and\r\n\r\nhard work. Because it is only in that way that we\r\n\r\ncan  show that the democratic system which we are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  establish can work. It is the  people\r\n\r\nwho  have  voted us in today - we have  transferred\r\n\r\npolitical  power to the community as a  whole  on\r\n\r\nthe  principle of one man one vote. The  majority\r\n\r\nof  them  are  underprivileged. They  live  in  a\r\n\r\nsociety which has never given them a chance,  and\r\n\r\nthey  will be increasingly doubtful and resentful\r\n\r\nof  the democratic system if we can offer them no\r\n\r\nprospect and no future in the coming years.  That\r\n\r\nis why we say we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  make  the  democratic system attractive  by\r\n\r\nasking  everybody, and in particular the\r\n\r\nbetter-off  classes, \"You had better contribute  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity's   coffers  to  ensure  that   social\r\n\r\njustice  can  be  brought  about  peacefully  and\r\n\r\nconstitutionally. If you are not prepared to make\r\n\r\nthose sacrifices, especially you, the well-to-do,\r\n\r\nthen  the sacrifices might be imposed on  you  by\r\n\r\nother more radical and more vigorous means.\"  The\r\n\r\ncontribution that everyone is making is really  a\r\n\r\nkind  of  social and political insurance  against\r\n\r\nthe  wrath  of revolutionary violence. The  price\r\n\r\nthat  we  are asked to pay today is  not  at  all\r\n\r\noppressive.  Nobody has said that  the  insurance\r\n\r\npremium,   as  it  were,  to  ensure   that   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic   system   survives   is   all    that\r\n\r\noppressive.  So the Opposition has  to  make  the\r\n\r\npretence - they have lately been saying  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  carried out private Gallup polls where  the\r\n\r\npeople  said  that things had gone  from  bad  to\r\n\r\nworse.  Let  me say this. If the P.A.P. economic\r\n\r\npolicy  succeeds, this is the consolation that  I\r\n\r\noffer  them, though they might have  to  keep  up\r\n\r\nthis  pretence by saying that things are  getting\r\n\r\nfrom  bad to worse - then the fears which they have\r\n\r\nbeen  trying to inculcate remain largely a  thing\r\n\r\nof  the imagination. But if it fails, then  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid that this myth which they have been trying\r\n\r\nto  propagate would become a reality, and  pursue\r\n\r\nthem  God knows to what nearest lamp-post. Social\r\n\r\njustice can be brought about only by the well-off\r\n\r\nclasses,  so  let them be prepared  to  make  the\r\n\r\nsacrifices.  There  is no  other  way.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthough the Opposition Members have criticised the\r\n\r\nBudget,   none  of  them  has  put   forward   an\r\n\r\nalternative  to  the  policy  outlined   by   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance. Therefore, I say that  this\r\n\r\nis a small price that we have to pay for ensuring\r\n\r\nthat the democratic system survives, by making it\r\n\r\nclear  to the majority of the people that  it  is\r\n\r\npossible for us to get social justice under  this\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  this is the second Budget  debate\r\n\r\nsince  the P.A.P. Government took office.  May  I\r\n\r\npreface my remarks by the observation that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevery   Assembly,  every  Chamber,   acquires   a\r\n\r\ncharacter  of  its own? Politically speaking,  in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore context, this Chamber  is  a  much\r\n\r\nmore  cynical and literate Chamber than the  last\r\n\r\none. We all make noises here not for the cut  and\r\n\r\nthrust   of  debate,  but  for  the  radio,   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  our friends and supporters  outside.\r\n\r\nWe  put  forward  a  point of  view,  whether  we\r\n\r\nbelieve in it or not; we shoot a line. Perhaps it\r\n\r\nis  inevitable,  as  a  result  of  the  election\r\n\r\nreturns on the night of 31st May, 1959, that this\r\n\r\nChamber,  consisting  of  51  Members  who   were\r\n\r\nreturned on that day, will go down in the  annals\r\n\r\nof  Singapore not as a debating Chamber but as  a\r\n\r\nconvenient  forum for declamation,  telling  lies\r\n\r\nand,   in  some  cases,  downright  perfidy   and\r\n\r\nuntruth; all in the hope that in this vicious rat\r\n\r\nrace  for newspaper space, you can get your point\r\n\r\nacross and kill the other chap; to try and convey\r\n\r\nan image to the public that you are a champion of\r\n\r\nthe  people when, in fact, you are no  more  than\r\n\r\njust  a  scamp  or  a scallywag seeking  personal\r\n\r\npower  and  glory; or to paint your  enemy  as  a\r\n\r\nwicked, reactionary and treacherous man who  sold\r\n\r\nout on his promises, either to win support or  to\r\n\r\ndeny  it to his opponents. All of us know in this\r\n\r\nrespect that we are more sophisticated, including\r\n\r\nour  dear  Member  for Tanglin. His  predecessors\r\n\r\numpteen  years  ago  in the  Chamber  across  the\r\n\r\nstreet  in  the  Victoria Memorial  Hall,  to  my\r\n\r\nrecollection,  were  of a  different  vein.  They\r\n\r\nplayed  up to the gallery in the Chamber  and  to\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  think  we must face  the  fact  that\r\n\r\ngranted the system of one man one vote, then  we\r\n\r\nare   not  interested  in  what  the  other  chap\r\n\r\nopposite  thinks. But the effect is different  on\r\n\r\nthe  thinking  of men away from the  Chamber  who\r\n\r\nread  two, three or four paragraphs or maybe  one\r\n\r\nheadline, or even half a caption. Therefore,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, while we are trying to maintain the\r\n\r\nbest  traditions of the parliamentary  system  of\r\n\r\nopen encounter in a debating Chamber, let us  not\r\n\r\ndelude ourselves that anybody is really seriously\r\n\r\ninterested in making an impression in this  House\r\n\r\nas  against making an impression in the  country.\r\n\r\nTherefore, for that reason, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember   for   Hong  Lim  fighting   bare-fisted,\r\n\r\ncontinued reading his speech. He said he had  the\r\n\r\nfigures.  I called him many things in many  other\r\n\r\nplaces, where there was no privilege, without ill\r\n\r\nresult  to myself. But Mr Speaker, Sir, when  we\r\n\r\ndevelop  our traditions and the rules of  debate,\r\n\r\nlet  us remember that if we do not modify and fit\r\n\r\nthem  to  our  circumstances,  as  the  rules  of\r\n\r\nWestminister were fitted for the circumstances of\r\n\r\nanother country, and at a different time, then we\r\n\r\nshall  only  let  ourselves be made  use  of  for\r\n\r\npurposes   for  which  this  Chamber   is   never\r\n\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those preliminary remarks, Sir, may I go on\r\n\r\nto   say  that,  although  we  have  become  more\r\n\r\nsophisticated and hard-boiled politically,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  believe  that  we have thereby  become  more\r\n\r\nadept   at  working  the  democratic  system   of\r\n\r\nperiodic mandates from the people on the basis of\r\n\r\none  man one vote. For the major premise  of  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful operation of that system postulates an\r\n\r\nintelligent Opposition, intelligent not  only  in\r\n\r\ntheir  immediate self-interest but also in  their\r\n\r\nlong-term  self-interest,  the  interest  of  not\r\n\r\nbringing the House down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have since half-past two this afternoon\r\n\r\nlistened through a series of declamation. I would\r\n\r\nsay that it contributed nothing, not one iota, to\r\n\r\nthe  people's  understanding of what  the  Budget\r\n\r\nmeant.  The  Member  for  Joo  Chiat,  with   his\r\n\r\ngrievous concern for businessmen, his friends and\r\n\r\ncolleagues  who  keep on telling  that  they  are\r\n\r\nlosing money and that the world is getting greyer\r\n\r\nand  greyer, had nothing to say. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai was speaking back.  I  think  this\r\n\r\nmust have been a special occasion for him - for  he\r\n\r\nspoke  in English today and tried to live  up  to\r\n\r\nwhat he thought one of the leaders of a secondary\r\n\r\nparty  in  the Opposition should do  on  such  an\r\n\r\noccasion.  And I congratulate him for  trying  to\r\n\r\nmake the effort and play this role, and keep  the\r\n\r\nsystem  that  we  want  to  preserve  going   and\r\n\r\nticking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Member for Tanglin could not\r\n\r\nhelp  himself. He honestly believed - I had a  word\r\n\r\nwith him outside; I did not want to interrupt him\r\n\r\nor make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim unhappy - and he said that Hugh Dalton's theory\r\n\r\nsupported him in the belief, that because we  cut\r\n\r\ndown  the  civil servants' allowances,  therefore\r\n\r\nthe   currency  circulation  of  Singapore,   the\r\n\r\nFederation and Borneo was stagnating at 1,000 odd\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars  and, therefore,  that  was  the\r\n\r\nreason for the general slump. Had we not cut down\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants' salaries, there would  have\r\n\r\nbeen a boom generated here, in the Federation and\r\n\r\nin  Borneo. I thought he had made a mistake, that\r\n\r\nhe  believed the figures given for currency  were\r\n\r\nonly  confined  to Singapore. But he  said  that,\r\n\r\nbeing  a  meticulous man who carefully  read  his\r\n\r\nfacts and figures, he knew that they covered  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of Borneo and the Federation, and he  was\r\n\r\nconvinced that the chain reaction-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> On a point of explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, surely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I did not want to go\r\n\r\ninto  details to explain that there was  a  slump\r\n\r\nhere.

Otherwise,  Sir, if there  had  also  been\r\n\r\nanother   slump  in  the  Federation,  then   the\r\n\r\nposition would have been different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We never cease to be\r\n\r\nsurprised  in  this  Chamber by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin.

What I wanted\r\n\r\nto  convey was the tremendous ease with which  he\r\n\r\ncould  go  through the contortions of a  complete\r\n\r\ncircle   and  come  back  to  where  he   started\r\n\r\nfrom - back to the Member for Farrer Park  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin who were once his  political\r\n\r\nopponents.  They  now wind up  as  his  political\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  friends and mentors.  What  does  he\r\n\r\nreally  believe  in? He is anti the  professional\r\n\r\ntax. Why? The Member for Farrer Park has given  a\r\n\r\nseries  of  reasons.  I am sure  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill really does not know why, but he has to\r\n\r\nbe  anti  something. He is anti the  professional\r\n\r\ntax. We have not taxed the poor, so he is against\r\n\r\nour  taxing the professions. He says he  supports\r\n\r\nthe  income tax increase but not the decrease  in\r\n\r\nthe allowances. Then the sly lie that we are more\r\n\r\nfriendly  to  capital. Sir,  we  want  to  create\r\n\r\nconfidence. The hon. Member knows just as well as\r\n\r\nwe  do that what we have to face in Singapore all\r\n\r\nthese  years  is  not  just to  be  friends  with\r\n\r\ncapital,  because that is not going to  help  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  But  we  have to  devise  within  our\r\n\r\nlimited  situation  a  balance  whereby  we   can\r\n\r\nconvince the workers that in this situation  they\r\n\r\nhave  the  best possible deal; and  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  to ensure that the best possible deal  for\r\n\r\nthe workers does not kill the goose that lays the\r\n\r\ngolden egg. The hon. Member tried, but he did not\r\n\r\nsucceed  in convincing the workers that they  got\r\n\r\nthe   best  possible  deal.  He  convinced   the\r\n\r\nemployer. Indeed I suppose the bosses in Tay  Koh\r\n\r\nYat and Hock Lee were convinced that that was the\r\n\r\nway, to ensure that business went on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut that is not our way of bringing confidence to\r\n\r\npeople with capital. My postulation is that  even\r\n\r\nif  a  person with capital had nothing but  \r\n\r\nself-interest at heart, then he would be interested in\r\n\r\nseeing,   not   that  he  alone  is   given   the\r\n\r\nconfidence, and that the worker is kept down, but\r\n\r\nthat  both should be, and the system, kept  going\r\n\r\nuntil such time as there is a major change in the\r\n\r\nsurrounding  circumstances. We must  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  worker is given a fair deal to his knowledge\r\n\r\nand  to his satisfaction, so that an armed revolt\r\n\r\nto change the social order never takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Farrer Park is, I think, the\r\n\r\nleast  hard-boiled  of all  the  Members  on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   benches.   He   has   unloaded   his\r\n\r\nconscience  of what he believes should  be  said,\r\n\r\nand  he therefore feels that he has done his  job\r\n\r\nas  leader  of  an Opposition Party  by  bringing\r\n\r\nacross  the  point  of view which  he  thinks  he\r\n\r\nrepresents. May I first dispose of his one  major\r\n\r\npoint in the whole speech really relating to this\r\n\r\nBudget, and that is the professional tax? He says\r\n\r\nthe  right to work should never be taxed.  Nobody\r\n\r\nis  trying  to tax the right to work.  Nobody  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to  tell  the  lawyer,  doctor,  dentist,\r\n\r\naccountant, engineer, or structural engineer that\r\n\r\nhe  should not work. But we know that in a  given\r\n\r\nsocial  order  these self-employable  professions\r\n\r\nare  lucrative ones; that if there  is  an  extra\r\n\r\nmillion  and  a  bit to be paid,  they  can  well\r\n\r\nafford  to pay it. I say, without any hesitation,\r\n\r\nthat  if we are to appreciate that amount of give\r\n\r\nand  take  which is necessary to the  running  of\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of  social order,  then  we  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared  not to be dogmatic but to be  practical\r\n\r\nin   the  circumstances  obtaining.  We  are  not\r\n\r\ntalking of a socialist Britain where almost every\r\n\r\nschoolboy  has the right to be a lawyer,  doctor,\r\n\r\ndentist  or engineer, because he has a completely\r\n\r\nfree  education sustained by the State  from  the\r\n\r\nprimary  school  to  the university.  We  have  a\r\n\r\ndifferent social order here. If you want to be  a\r\n\r\nlawyer,  doctor,  dentist or engineer,  then  the\r\n\r\nodds  are that you are one of the very few  lucky\r\n\r\nscholars  of the State, or you have a  father  or\r\n\r\nmother sufficiently wealthy to pay for it.  These\r\n\r\nare  privileged professions. You cannot  practise\r\n\r\nas a lawyer unless you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare   qualified  and  unless  the  Bar  Committee\r\n\r\nempowered   by   the  Advocates  and   Solicitors\r\n\r\nOrdinance says that you can practise. This is the\r\n\r\nmonopoly we are giving to certain professions. It\r\n\r\nis the same with the doctors and the dentists.  I\r\n\r\ncannot practise as a dentist by just learning how\r\n\r\nto  drill holes in a tooth and how to pull  teeth\r\n\r\nout.  If  I  do,  I  will be  sent  to  gaol  for\r\n\r\nbreaching the Ordinance governing who can and who\r\n\r\ncannot  practise  as  a dentist.  In  this  given\r\n\r\nsituation, therefore, we say that these  are  the\r\n\r\ngroup  of  people  fortunately  endowed  in   the\r\n\r\npresent  social order to pay the extra  bit.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer Park thought  that  $500  per\r\n\r\nannum   or   $125  per  quarter - it  sounds   more\r\n\r\ndrastic - is too much. Sir, he did not say  it  was\r\n\r\ntoo much for him. He was spilling a few tears for\r\n\r\nthose who would come after him. Well, if that  is\r\n\r\nso,  then  we will wait and see what it  is  like\r\n\r\nfrom  the  income  tax  returns,  including   the\r\n\r\nreturns from the young lawyers, doctors, dentists\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  We  are quite confident  that  this\r\n\r\nprofessional tax is just a flea-bite. If it comes\r\n\r\nto  that,  they are the people who  have  special\r\n\r\nprivileges.  In  the Supreme  Court  there  is  a\r\n\r\nspecial Bar room for lawyers to change. It is\r\n\r\nair-conditioned at the expense of the State. They are\r\n\r\nnot  charged for it. And there are lots of  other\r\n\r\nparks.   They  go  to  courts  which   are \r\n\r\nair-conditioned  now  in order that they  can  better\r\n\r\ndischarge their duties. It is the same  with  the\r\n\r\ndoctors. They have hospitals, ambulances on  tap,\r\n\r\nand  laboratories  to tell them  what  particular\r\n\r\nvaccine  is  required  to  kill  what  particular\r\n\r\nbacilli. On principle, in this situation,  I  say\r\n\r\nthis  levying of a professional tax is definitely\r\n\r\na  progressive move. You are getting  money  from\r\n\r\nthe  people who can pay. It would be much easier,\r\n\r\nof  course, for the Minister for Finance to  slip\r\n\r\nin  a  10  cent  tax on every pair  of  shoes  or\r\n\r\numbrella  or  frying pan. Nobody would  feel  it.\r\n\r\nAfter  all,  hon. Members opposite will  buy  one\r\n\r\nfrying  pan each probably once in every three  or\r\n\r\nfour  years. Lots of other people would  want  to\r\n\r\nbuy  frying  pans. But we do not want to  collect\r\n\r\nmoney  that way. If this is not socialism, it  is\r\n\r\nat least a little bit of social conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park then went on to make\r\n\r\nanother point. He said a few nice things. Usually\r\n\r\nit  is  done by any practised advocate. One  says\r\n\r\nnice  things  in  order that one can  destroy.  A\r\n\r\nbrilliant   group  of  Ministers,  but   terribly\r\n\r\npractical  and realistic. Sir, we are accused  of\r\n\r\nhaving  failed  because we have not  managed  the\r\n\r\ncivil service. We have lost the confidence of the\r\n\r\npeople. There is uncertainty in Singapore.  There\r\n\r\nis   economic   stagnation.  The   situation   is\r\n\r\ngenerally  depressed. I could not  help  thinking\r\n\r\nthat  we  would individually have all  been  much\r\n\r\nbetter off and probably leading happier and  less\r\n\r\nburdensome  lives,  if we had  made  a  different\r\n\r\ndecision  before the elections and had  for  some\r\n\r\nreason  or other decided not to contest  to  win.\r\n\r\nThe  only consolation I have is that it would not\r\n\r\nhave  been as it is today. They never had  it  so\r\n\r\ngood.  Not since 1955 has there been a government\r\n\r\nwhich   has   established   confidence   in   the\r\n\r\nemployers.  We  are not interested  in  employers\r\n\r\nalone, but we are interested in creating a system\r\n\r\nwhich  is  just  fair,  honest,  above-board  and\r\n\r\nlikely  to  endure because it is fair, clean  and\r\n\r\nhonest.  That  makes  a  big  difference  to  our\r\n\r\nfuture.   I  do  not  pretend,  Sir,  that   this\r\n\r\nGovernment  exists  for the  benefit  of  keeping\r\n\r\nemployers  happy, but if it is necessary  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people as a whole to ensure that\r\n\r\nemployers  are  not destroyed  or  taxed  out  of\r\n\r\nexistence, then we have the courage to  stand  up\r\n\r\nand  see that balances are maintained, regardless\r\n\r\nof what tortured unbalanced minds may try to make\r\n\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, eight new taxes were listed by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance. I would have thought that he  would\r\n\r\nhave  taxed to the limit of human ingenuity, that\r\n\r\nhe  would have tried to make out that here was  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  out to tax the poor,  not  the  rich.\r\n\r\nProperty    tax    and    assessment,    business\r\n\r\nregistrations,  stamp duty, increased  assessment\r\n\r\non  rubber  estates, increased rates  on  private\r\n\r\nlotteries,  fees  for  the  practice  of  certain\r\n\r\nprofessions,  passenger  tax  on  embarking   air\r\n\r\ntravellers,  decrease  in the  rate  of  personal\r\n\r\nallowances on income tax, increase in the maximum\r\n\r\nrate  of  tax on personal income, and  a  special\r\n\r\nallowance for earned income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly  a tortured and sick mind would try and read\r\n\r\ninto  this  an  attempt to help  colonial  vested\r\n\r\ninterests,  to tax the poor to help the  European\r\n\r\ncompanies which did not vote us in, and  in  whom\r\n\r\nwe  are  not interested. For what earthly ghastly\r\n\r\nreason?   As  the  odds  become  more  and   more\r\n\r\ndifficult for those who have found themselves out\r\n\r\non  a lonely limb, it is not unlikely that as  we\r\n\r\ngo  on, more and more fantastic allegations  will\r\n\r\nbe  made,  but  not for the purposes  of  winning\r\n\r\nsupport in this debating Chamber, because nobody,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  with no disrespect  to  your\r\n\r\naugust   position,  wants  really  to  win   your\r\n\r\nsupport.  It  would be flattering to  know  that,\r\n\r\namongst the many thousands of people outside, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, there are many who believe that the\r\n\r\npolicy  one is expounding is fair and  just.  One\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  sufficiently cynical  to  understand\r\n\r\nthat. The play of the system of one man one  vote\r\n\r\nin  this  given  situation leads gradually  to  a\r\n\r\ndebasement  in  some  cases  where  integrity  of\r\n\r\npolitical purpose and principles are lacking,  to\r\n\r\na  complete debasement of everything and anything\r\n\r\nworth  valuing  in  any  society - things  such  as\r\n\r\ntruth, honesty and decency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after one past sitting, I have had\r\n\r\noccassion  to  say in no uncertain terms  outside\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber what I thought of people  here  who\r\n\r\nbehaved in this way and we had peace and serenity\r\n\r\nfor  two sittings thereafter. Our intentions  are\r\n\r\nquite clear. It may be quite possible that in the\r\n\r\nnext  few  days, you, Sir, will have a much  more\r\n\r\nlively  time  than  you really  deserve.  We  all\r\n\r\nexpect lively debates. In fact, it is part of the\r\n\r\nplay  of intellect and wit; or if wit is lacking,\r\n\r\nthen  at  least some buffoonery to take away  the\r\n\r\ntedium  and monotony of the day. But one thing  I\r\n\r\nsay:   in   any   wicked  and  deliberate   lies,\r\n\r\nfalsehoods and distortions, people play them with\r\n\r\ntheir gloves on, but we play them with our gloves\r\n\r\noff.  In  this Chamber, Sir, it is bad to  expose\r\n\r\nknuckle-dusters, but one can use  knuckle-dusters\r\n\r\nall  the  same, and outside this Chamber  we  can\r\n\r\nwell look after ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that Members of the House have to\r\n\r\nwaste  the  time  of other Members  who  have  to\r\n\r\nlisten to why hawkers and taxi-drivers are  being\r\n\r\nbled to death by smoking 20 cigarettes a day, and\r\n\r\nwhy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people's income tax has increased to  $1,000\r\n\r\nright  up  to  infinity in the lower range;  from\r\n\r\nnever  having  to  pay income tax  to  paying  $5\r\n\r\nincome  tax, and it goes up to infinity.

B. C. on this business of hawkers  and\r\n\r\ntaxi-drivers. They are in the public image partly\r\n\r\nbecause  we  made it so. We built  it  up  as  an\r\n\r\nexample  of  the man in the Clapton omnibus.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim did not think of  it.  There\r\n\r\nwere  other brains in the Party. The man  in  the\r\n\r\nClapton  omnibus  was  the English  idea  of  the\r\n\r\ncommon man. The common man here is your worker in\r\n\r\nthe  factory, your hawker, your taxi-driver, your\r\n\r\ntrisha-rider,  and I defy anybody, including  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim, despite the extent to  which\r\n\r\nhe  can comport his mind, to spell out from  this\r\n\r\nBudget  an  intention to take one cent from  them\r\n\r\nwhich they should not pay. Property tax, business\r\n\r\ntax,  stamp duty, increased assessment on  rubber\r\n\r\nestates.  Well, if any taxi-driver has  a  rubber\r\n\r\nestate,  he  should pay assessment on  it.  Rates\r\n\r\nfrom private lotteries? He is not a member of the\r\n\r\nclubs that run these private lotteries and I know\r\n\r\nof no working men's club that runs this one-armed\r\n\r\nbandit.  Those  who  run it are  usually  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle income groups. Professional tax, passenger\r\n\r\ntax-taxi-drivers and trisha-riders going  by  air\r\n\r\nto  Kuala Lumpur pay an extra dollar. Decrease in\r\n\r\nrates of income tax-do they pay tax? There is  no\r\n\r\ntaxi-driver  or  trisha-rider or  hawker  in  the\r\n\r\nincome  tax books. The Member for Hong Lim  ought\r\n\r\nto  know  these things, but he has to go back  to\r\n\r\nthe taxes which he agreed on to try and spell  it\r\n\r\nout.

Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   the  first  day  of  the  debate  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment financial policy is generally regarded\r\n\r\nas  a  field day for the Opposition. This is  the\r\n\r\nopportunity for them to roam far and wide on  the\r\n\r\nproposals  contained in the Budget  Statement.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  help feeling, however, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Opposition on this occasion have  been\r\n\r\nsingularly insipid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate started off with the Member for Joo\r\n\r\nChiat who came out with a rollicking big piece of\r\n\r\njesting.  Here  is a man who wants  to  introduce\r\n\r\nunemployment  insurance, old-age  insurance,  the\r\n\r\nrestoration of the whole of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  variable allowance to the civil service,  to\r\n\r\nincrease the pay of the Work Brigade, to  set  up\r\n\r\ntrade  commissions all over the world,  including\r\n\r\nthe  City of Peking; and yet he is worried  about\r\n\r\nthe tax increases that we are introducing. Having\r\n\r\ndelivered his speech, he duly departed from  this\r\n\r\nChamber,  never to return.

I do not want - and time does not permit me - to\r\n\r\ncover  in  any  detail the  points  made  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  I do want at a later stage  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  some  of the statements made by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong Lim. But generally, the principal point\r\n\r\nput  forward by Members of the Opposition was  to\r\n\r\nchallenge  my contention that there  has  been  a\r\n\r\nsolid and substantial economic revival this year.\r\n\r\nI made my Statement and produced as much evidence\r\n\r\nas  possible  by  way  of  statistics  of  trade,\r\n\r\nproduction   and  finance  in   support   of   my\r\n\r\ncontention. On the other hand, the Opposition, on\r\n\r\nthe  most dubious of evidence, disputed the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  any  revival  has taken place.  They  cited\r\n\r\nunnamed  business friends of theirs - and there  is\r\n\r\nno  doubt  that  members of the S.P.A. are  well\r\n\r\nrelated to businessmen - without specifying at  all\r\n\r\nin what trade, in what business and in what form,\r\n\r\nstagnation  has  taken  place.  The  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill attempted to be more specific than  the\r\n\r\nothers,  and  cited the closing  down  of  coffee\r\n\r\nshops as a true indication of business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstagnation. Now, no serious student of  economics\r\n\r\nwill  pay the slightest attention to evidence  of\r\n\r\nthis kind. Only in one respect, however, did  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Cairnhill  produce   evidence   in\r\n\r\nrebuttal,  and  that  is when  he  challenged  my\r\n\r\nfigures  of cargo loaded in the Singapore Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard. There is no discrepancy at all between the\r\n\r\nstatement that he read in the newspapers  and  my\r\n\r\nremarks in my Budget statement. What he failed to\r\n\r\nunderstand was that my figures related to general\r\n\r\ncargo  and  did  not  include  mineral  oil   and\r\n\r\nvegetable  oil  in  bulk. And quite  rightly  so,\r\n\r\nbecause  for  the last four or five years,  there\r\n\r\nhas  been a long-term decline in the quantity  of\r\n\r\nmineral  oil,  petroleum, crude oil,  and  bunker\r\n\r\noil.  The  long-term decline  in  that  trade  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  nothing to do with  the  internal\r\n\r\nconditions  in  Singapore. It is just  due  to  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  over-supply in the oil industry, fiercer\r\n\r\ncompetition,  and  installation  of  oil   supply\r\n\r\npoints  in  various ports of the world. Excluding\r\n\r\nthis  declining element of oil, my figures, as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  did indicate a fairly substantial increase\r\n\r\nin both volume and value of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a general point made, too, that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. economic  policy has  differed  from  the\r\n\r\npolicies enunciated before the general elections.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, if you will recall, I went  to\r\n\r\ngreat   lengths  to  explain  that  our   present\r\n\r\npolicies  are  absolutely  consistent  with   the\r\n\r\npolicies  we declared to the electorate  and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public  before  the  elections.  I  will\r\n\r\nreturn to this point later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said sometime ago that I intended to spend\r\n\r\nsome  time dealing with some statements  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim. Mr Speaker, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  has been called various  names  and\r\n\r\nepithets  which  may  not  be  repeated  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber.  You  will  recall, Sir,  that  after  a\r\n\r\nsitting  of  this  Assembly two months  ago,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister called the Member for Hong Lim  a\r\n\r\nliar and a rogue. In the course of proceedings in\r\n\r\na  Press conference following that, my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Labour, added in another  term\r\n\r\n\"coward\". Now, Sir, in Biblical times, there  was\r\n\r\na  legendary character named Beelzebub,  who  was\r\n\r\nknown as the prince of liars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd,  of  course, lying has been a human  failing\r\n\r\nfrom   time  immemorial.

Speaking more broadly,  I\r\n\r\nwas about to develop the theme that there are two\r\n\r\ntypes  of  lying. One is what Dr Goebbels  said,\r\n\r\nthat   is,  to  repeat  a  big  lie  and  do   it\r\n\r\npersistently,  eventually  making   the   general\r\n\r\npublic  believe in it. The other is what we  have\r\n\r\nseen   more  recently  in  the  case  of  Senator\r\n\r\nMcCarthy, who did not believe in hammering home a\r\n\r\nbig  lie, but in spreading a lot of little  lies,\r\n\r\nwhich add up then to a big smear. The Member  for\r\n\r\nHong Lim, I would say, is no Dr Goebbels and the\r\n\r\nvarious mis-statements of fact and distortion  of\r\n\r\nopinion  contained  in  his  statement  make  one\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  he is a supporter of the  McCarthy\r\n\r\nschool.  Now,  Sir, if we were not restricted  by\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders, I would have come  straight  to\r\n\r\nthe  point and said that I want to talk about his\r\n\r\nwhopping downright big lies. But the rules of the\r\n\r\ndebate  being  what they are, I will  merely  say\r\n\r\nthat  I will deal with a number of terminological\r\n\r\ninexactitudes indulged in by the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to deal with matters of principle, but I\r\n\r\nthink it is necessary to show the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim as a man who is extremely reckless, extremely\r\n\r\nblatant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  unashamed  when it comes  to  distinguishing\r\n\r\ntruth from falsehood, facts from illusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now come to the ten items? I will\r\n\r\nhave to go through them very quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.

There   was   no\r\n\r\nevidence whatsoever, although he assured us  that\r\n\r\nhe  had  spent a week in making his calculations.\r\n\r\nIf  he  refers to the 1958 Annual Report  of  the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax Department, he will find that profits\r\n\r\nmade  in  Singapore amount to  $375  million.  He\r\n\r\nproduced a book of sharebrokers and gave  details\r\n\r\nof  profits  of  the biggest European  firms.  My\r\n\r\nrecollection  is that the total  profits  do  not\r\n\r\nexceed  $7  million. I am not here to defend  the\r\n\r\nproposition  whether  European  firms  should  or\r\n\r\nshould not make money. The point is that he  made\r\n\r\nthat statement and that it was inaccurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Member said that he saved the civil\r\n\r\nservants  in  the lower grades from pay  cuts.  I\r\n\r\ndeny this most categorically. I had no assistance\r\n\r\nand no advice at all from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. He said that a 5 per cent increase in tax on\r\n\r\nincomes  of $10,000 a year would yield little  by\r\n\r\nway of additional tax. This is completely untrue.\r\n\r\nWe  expect  this increase to yield an  additional\r\n\r\ntax of $1 million per year or more than the whole\r\n\r\nincrease from new taxpayers brought into the  tax\r\n\r\norbit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Inexactitude No. 4. He said that Shell Company\r\n\r\npays no tax on profits in Pulau Bukom. That was a\r\n\r\ndefinite statement and he challenged me  to  deny\r\n\r\nit. Sir, the Member was formerly the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational  Development,  under  whose  charge  the\r\n\r\nassessment of properties is allotted. An ordinary\r\n\r\nman  will  say that he knows what the facts  are.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  facts are that Shell Company is  paying\r\n\r\ntax  on  the profits in Pulau Bukom at the  rates\r\n\r\napplicable to that section in the rural areas. It\r\n\r\nis  true  that  when  he  was  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development, he tried to  increase  the\r\n\r\namount of assessment that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShell  Company  was paying - a very worthy  effort.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  this  led to  no  result  at  all\r\n\r\nbecause he had chased away all the officers  from\r\n\r\nhis Assessment Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Time does not permit me, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Could I ask the Minister -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

These are\r\n\r\nminor - I   cannot   use   a  four-letter   English\r\n\r\nword - inexactitudes.  He  said  that  the  Cabinet\r\n\r\nEstimates  Committee was not responsible  to  the\r\n\r\nCabinet. That is absolutely untrue. He made  some\r\n\r\nstatements    regarding    the    incidence    of\r\n\r\ntaxation - that taxi drivers woud have  to  pay  so\r\n\r\nmany  million  dollars, trishaw  riders  so  many\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars, and so on and so  forth.  There\r\n\r\nwas  no explanation of how the calculations  were\r\n\r\nmade.  Where were the data? None whatsoever.  The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has already disposed of this point\r\n\r\nand  I  will  press on to the next  one.  In  the\r\n\r\nopinion of the Member for Hong Lim, tax increases\r\n\r\nwere unnecessary, having regard to the amount  of\r\n\r\nadditional  tax, namely, $45 million, because  we\r\n\r\ncould have saved that amount of money by pruning\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  And he even went to the  extent  of\r\n\r\nquoting  from  an election campaign statement  of\r\n\r\nthe Party saying that this is what we shall do. I\r\n\r\nwas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlooking  forward  to  some suggestions  from  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim as to how we could  save  an\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  this magnitude from  the  public\r\n\r\nfund.  Indeed,  if he had made any proposals,  we\r\n\r\nwould  have  listened to them with interest.  But\r\n\r\nhaving said that he would save $45 million in the\r\n\r\nExpenditure  Estimates, he did not  specify  even\r\n\r\none item - not a single one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, he said that companies do\r\n\r\nnot  pay tax, and when my colleague, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education, sought clarification on that,  he\r\n\r\nconfirmed that that was the case. It seems to  me\r\n\r\nabsolutely   appalling  that  a   person,   whose\r\n\r\nprofession is accountancy, could have  made  this\r\n\r\nmost    elementary   blunder.

At\r\n\r\npresent  the company tax is 40 per cent  and  the\r\n\r\nmoney  so  paid can be used as a set-off  against\r\n\r\ndividends  distributed.

No studies have been made  here,\r\n\r\nto  my  knowledge,  of  the exact  percentage  of\r\n\r\nprofits   that  have  been  ploughed  back.   But\r\n\r\nobviously  under  the  present  arrangements,  if\r\n\r\npublic companies were to keep back one-quarter of\r\n\r\ntheir  gross profits and not distribute  them  as\r\n\r\ndividends, then the yield from tax would  be  the\r\n\r\nsame  as under the present tax arrangement.  That\r\n\r\nis  a  matter of simple arithmetic. But  if  more\r\n\r\nthan a quarter of the gross profits are retained,\r\n\r\nthen  this  new tax proposal will have a  smaller\r\n\r\nyield than the present arrangement. And if I were\r\n\r\nto  hazard a guess as to the proportion of  gross\r\n\r\nprofits retained in businesses, I would say  that\r\n\r\nit  would be nearer half than one-quarter, taking\r\n\r\nall the companies as a group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the bright proposal to tax\r\n\r\nmilitary   vehicles.  This  has  a  rather   long\r\n\r\nhistory.  The implication here seems to  be  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government does not receive any payment from\r\n\r\nthe Defence Department of the U.K. Government  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  property, vehicles and other  things\r\n\r\nowned and run by the War Department. This is  not\r\n\r\nquite  true. They are paying a sum of $900,000  a\r\n\r\nyear  in  lieu of the payment of rates  on  their\r\n\r\nproperty. We have not agreed that this amount  is\r\n\r\na  fair and equitable compensation. But the point\r\n\r\nis  that  payment is being made. When the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong  Lim  was  the  Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  we protested strongly  against  the\r\n\r\ninadequacy   of   this   contribution,   and   he\r\n\r\naccordingly undertook to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreassess  all Service properties with a  view  to\r\n\r\nincreasing   this  contribution -  a  praiseworthy\r\n\r\nundertaking. I remember distinctly  that  I  gave\r\n\r\nhim  four  months to let me have details  of  the\r\n\r\nrevaluation  of Service properties.  But  he  was\r\n\r\nquite unable to produce it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of information, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister does not give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It was quite beyond his\r\n\r\nmeans, for the same reason that he had chased out\r\n\r\nall his technical staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I be permitted, in the short time at my\r\n\r\ndisposal,  to  bring  to perspective  the  Budget\r\n\r\nproposals?  As  I  have  said,  this  cannot   be\r\n\r\nconsidered as a one-year attempt in isolation. We\r\n\r\nmust  see  it  in  the economic setting  we  find\r\n\r\nourselves  today - a  tremendous population  growth\r\n\r\nwith  its  inevitable increase in the numbers  of\r\n\r\nyoung  men and women looking for work every year.\r\n\r\nWith  political changes, there is a need not only\r\n\r\nto  create  more jobs for the growing population,\r\n\r\nbut  also to bring about more social justice. All\r\n\r\nthis  means  getting  money.  Money,  first,   to\r\n\r\nfinance  development expenditure so that  we  can\r\n\r\nmake   it  easier  and  more  certain  that   new\r\n\r\nindustries will be established in Singapore, both\r\n\r\nby local businessmen and overseas businessmen, or\r\n\r\nby  joint participation between themselves. Then,\r\n\r\non  the  other  hand,  we  have  to  provide  for\r\n\r\nimproved  social  services,  more  schools,  more\r\n\r\nassistance  to  those  who do  not  have  regular\r\n\r\nincomes - assistance   in   the   way   of   public\r\n\r\nassistance,  unemployment relief schemes  and  so\r\n\r\nforth. In order to get this extra money, we  have\r\n\r\nto  decide from which sectors of the economy  the\r\n\r\nmoney  must  come from, and who are the  type  of\r\n\r\npeople to pay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor this. It is very clear from the nature of the\r\n\r\nnew  tax proposals that the general principle  is\r\n\r\nto  spread  the  burden as  broadly  as  possible\r\n\r\namongst  those  who  can afford  to  pay.  Hence,\r\n\r\npeople  such  as  shopkeepers, lawyers,  doctors,\r\n\r\nengineers, landlords, people who travel  by  air,\r\n\r\nlimited companies, and so forth have been  called\r\n\r\nupon  to make a small extra contribution  to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  welfare.  The amounts  are  well  within\r\n\r\ntheir capacity to pay. To represent the Budget as\r\n\r\nsoaking  the poor to pay for the rich is  such  a\r\n\r\ntravesty of the truth that it is hardly necessary\r\n\r\nfor me to rebut it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to conclude with some observations as to\r\n\r\nthe  general problem that is facing  us  and  the\r\n\r\nsolutions that are available to us. Let us  never\r\n\r\nassume  that the difficulties ahead are going  to\r\n\r\nbe   easily   disposed  of  without  effort   and\r\n\r\nsacrifice  by  large numbers of  people.  I  have\r\n\r\nreferred in my Budget statement to the fact  that\r\n\r\nall   Asian  countries  try  to  create  material\r\n\r\nprosperity for their subjects. But few people are\r\n\r\naware  that this is going to be a long and  harsh\r\n\r\njourney.  What  I  have tried to  explain  in  my\r\n\r\nBudget  statement is that we must take  a  longer\r\n\r\nperspective, and within the development plan, try\r\n\r\nto  form a framework of our period 1961 to  1964.\r\n\r\nBut  even this period itself, with all the  money\r\n\r\nand  the  resources  that we  intend  to  put  in\r\n\r\ndevelopment, represent but the first  step  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  long  journey.  But this  I  can  say  with\r\n\r\nconfidence.  In  taking  this  step,  we  have  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  is  in sound  condition  and  a\r\n\r\ncountry in good heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy\r\n\r\nof the Government for the year 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn.\"\r\n\r\n-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">one minute to Ten o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1960/19601208/19601208-HA-0140205.pdf\"\">MAIN ESTIMATES AND DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES, 1961 (Cols 0205-0210)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
