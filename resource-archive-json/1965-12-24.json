With  the\r\n\r\nseparation  of Singapore from Malaysia, it is  necessary\r\n\r\nto  promulgate  our own Telecommunications  legislation.\r\n\r\nThe   Telecommunications  Bill  seeks   to   enact   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Telecommunications Ordinance, 1950, of\r\n\r\nMalaysia with the necessary amendments consequent on the\r\n\r\nattainment of independence by Singapore and its  ceasing\r\n\r\nto be a part of Malaysia. The penalties in the Bill have\r\n\r\nbeen  equated  to the penalties set out in the  repealed\r\n\r\nTelegraphs  Ordinance, Chapter 108, of Singapore.  These\r\n\r\nare   higher   than   those  in  the  Telecommunications\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1950, of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nsay  a few words about external telecommunications which\r\n\r\nhad  previously been operated by the company of Cable  &\r\n\r\nWireless  Ltd.  The legal position with respect  to  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  external  telecommunication  services  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is as follows. Licences were granted to  Cable\r\n\r\n& Wireless Ltd, as follows - Cable Lending Licence by Deed\r\n\r\ndated 9th November,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1939, Licence for Underground Lending by Deed dated 22nd\r\n\r\nNovember,  1940, and the Wireless Telegraph  Licence  by\r\n\r\nDeed  dated  1953. These Licences appear to be  licences\r\n\r\nfor  definite  periods and were due to  expire  on  31st\r\n\r\nDecember, 1962. On the expiry of these licences, it  was\r\n\r\nthe  intention of the Singapore Government to take  over\r\n\r\nthe  services  under  the provisions  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nOverseas Telecommunications Board Ordinance, 1962, which\r\n\r\nwas  passed  in the last Singapore Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nearly  in  1962.  However, action on the  Ordinance  was\r\n\r\ndeferred  because of a written request by  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Works  and  Telecommunications  and  Posts  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation    of   Malaya,   that   the    subject    of\r\n\r\ntelecommunications should be discussed at meetings of  a\r\n\r\nGovernment Committee set up to deal with the details  on\r\n\r\nthe   transfer   of  subjects  to  the  future   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Malaysia. Arising out of this request  by\r\n\r\nthe  Kuala  Lumpur Government, the Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nagreed  to  extend the licences of Cable &  Wireless  to\r\n\r\noperate for another period of two years from the 1st  of\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1963, to the 31st December, 1964. Subsequently\r\n\r\nwith   Singapore  joining  Malaysia,  telecommunications\r\n\r\nbecame  the responsibility of the Central Government  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  and  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong  by   Order\r\n\r\nrepealed the Telegraphs Ordinance of Singapore, repealed\r\n\r\nthe    Singapore   Overseas   Telecommunications   Board\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1962,  and  extended the  Telecommunications\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1950, of Malaysia to Singapore. On  the  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1965,  the licences of Cable & Wireless  Ltd.,\r\n\r\nhaving  expired, the Government of Malaysia  decided  to\r\n\r\ntake  over the assets of the company and to operate  the\r\n\r\nservice with effect from 1st January, 1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal position appears to be that the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment   acted   under   the   provisions   of   the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications  Ordinance,  1950,  under  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has the exclusive privilege of  establishing\r\n\r\nradio communications stations, and on the expiry of  the\r\n\r\nlicence  of Cable & Wireless Ltd., took over the running\r\n\r\nof  the  services.  Now,  if Singapore  had  not  joined\r\n\r\nMalaysia, Singapore would similarly have terminated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nthe  licence of Cable & Wireless Ltd, and taken over the\r\n\r\nservices.  This right comes within the terms  \"Property,\r\n\r\nRights,  Liabilities,  and  Obligations\"  which,  before\r\n\r\nMalaysia Day, belonged to and were the responsibility of\r\n\r\nthe Government of Singapore and must, under Article 9 of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution and Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Act\r\n\r\nrevert  to  Singapore.  It  is  the  intention  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  on  the  Telecommunications  Bill\r\n\r\nbecoming   law  to  take  action  to  operate   external\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  services which had  previously  been\r\n\r\ncarried out by Cable & Wireless Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government understands that the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Malaysia had not finalised  an  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  Cable & Wireless Ltd, on the quantum which had  to\r\n\r\nbe  paid to the company as a result of the take-over  of\r\n\r\nthe  assets of the company. However, we believe that  so\r\n\r\nfar  only  a  sum  of $5 million has been  paid  by  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government of Malaysia to Cable & Wireless  Ltd.\r\n\r\nin  respect  of the take-over of movable assets  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Singapore Government that,\r\n\r\non  our  taking over the assets of the previous Cable  &\r\n\r\nWireless Ltd., we would reimburse the Central Government\r\n\r\nof Malaysia whatever sums they have paid to the company.\r\n\r\nI  would like to emphasise that the takeover of external\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  in Singapore will  not  in  any  way\r\n\r\nendanger  the  defence or the security or  the  external\r\n\r\ncommunications of Malaysia. The armed services defending\r\n\r\nMalaysia  already have their own circuits at Jurong  for\r\n\r\nexternal communications. Furthermore, Malaysia could use\r\n\r\nthe  Seacom  circuits  for  external  communications  as\r\n\r\nMalaysia herself is a partner to the Seacom project  and\r\n\r\na  member  of the Commonwealth Cable Committee.  And  as\r\n\r\nsuch,  Singapore could not deny Malaysia the  facilities\r\n\r\nof Seacom, of which Singapore is also a partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also want to make this reassurance, that\r\n\r\nSingapore, in keeping with the spirit of friendship  and\r\n\r\nco-operation  accompanying  the  establishment  of   the\r\n\r\nindependent and sovereign State of Singapore, will  want\r\n\r\nto extend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall   facilities   provided  by  the  Telecommunications\r\n\r\nDepartment  (External)  to the Malaysian  Government.  I\r\n\r\nwould  only like to inform the House that Malaysia today\r\n\r\nalso  has  its  own external communications  station  in\r\n\r\nPenang  when  it  took over Cable & Wireless  assets  in\r\n\r\nPenang  and ran it as a Government department  after  it\r\n\r\nbecame a sovereign and independent country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have communicated with the Central Government of\r\n\r\nMalaysia of our intentions to move the Second and  Third\r\n\r\nReadings of the Telecommunications Bill today and  that,\r\n\r\non the Bill becoming law, the Singapore Government would\r\n\r\ntake  over  all  responsibility  for  the  operation  of\r\n\r\nexternal communications in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.-{Dr Toh Chin Chye}.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE ASIAN SEAMEN'S</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CLUB INCORPORATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7 (1) of the Singapore Asian Seamen's Club\r\n\r\nIncorporation  Ordinance requires that  members  of  the\r\n\r\nAsian   Seamen's   Club  Committee  be   appointed   for\r\n\r\nnominations  by  seafarers'  trade  unions  and  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Shipowners' Association.

Before the P.A.P. Government assumed  office\r\n\r\nin  1959,  there were only 28 community  centres  and  3\r\n\r\nholiday  camps.  Today  it has,  under  its  control,  a\r\n\r\nnetwork  of  180 community centres and 7  holiday  camps\r\n\r\nspread  throughout  the island. It has  also  set  up  a\r\n\r\nmillion-dollar   National  Youth   Leadership   Training\r\n\r\nInstitute at South Buona Vista Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 60 per cent of our population is below 21\r\n\r\nyears  of  age. The question of channelling the abundant\r\n\r\nenergies of youths towards constructive ends in national\r\n\r\nbuilding and leadership poses a major problem that needs\r\n\r\nto be urgently\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntackled. The Government has, therefore, established this\r\n\r\nTraining  Institute at South Buona Vista Road  and  this\r\n\r\nhas  marked  a  new  phase  in the  concerted  long-term\r\n\r\nefforts of the Government to solve the problem of youths\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, youth is not the only problem that needs to\r\n\r\nbe  tackled  through organised activities  at  community\r\n\r\ncentres. Through experience, it has become evident  that\r\n\r\nthere   is   a  need  for  organised  social,  cultural,\r\n\r\neducational  .and athletic activities in  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres  to  meet the varied demands of  the  other  age\r\n\r\ngroups.  One outstanding example is the need to  set  up\r\n\r\nkindergarten classes and children's clubs for  children,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the rural areas of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found that anti-national elements in the\r\n\r\nCommunist  United Front have been making use of  various\r\n\r\nkindergarten  classes organised by them,  especially  in\r\n\r\nrural areas, as a convenient instrument for carrying out\r\n\r\ntheir   subversive   activities  and  furthering   their\r\n\r\nnefarious  political ends. It may puzzle those  innocent\r\n\r\nof  the  villainy  of  which  pro-Communist  agents  are\r\n\r\ncapable,  how  such  innocuous  institutions   such   as\r\n\r\nkindergartens  can be used as a channel  of  subversion.\r\n\r\nSir,  this  is done in two ways. The first is  to  teach\r\n\r\ninfants and toddlers to sing anti-government jingles. In\r\n\r\nancient  China, the chanting of anti-government  jingles\r\n\r\nby children usually heralds popular uprising against the\r\n\r\nimperial  dynasty. Our modern Marxist-Leninists  do  not\r\n\r\ndespise  this well-tried and ancient method. The  second\r\n\r\nway  of  subversion is provided by access to parents  of\r\n\r\nthe  children  in  their kindergarten  classes.  In  the\r\n\r\ncountryside,   where  the  population  is   lacking   in\r\n\r\nsophistication, parents believe that their children  are\r\n\r\nbeing   educated   in   these  kindergartens   and   are\r\n\r\naccordingly  grateful  to the teachers.  These  teachers\r\n\r\nare,  of  course, Communist United Front  operators  who\r\n\r\nnever  fail  to cash in on such gratitude by propagating\r\n\r\nthe party line. The Communist United Front kindergartens\r\n\r\nare  completely illegal and are conducted  by  untrained\r\n\r\nand  unlicensed  teachers. However, summarily  to  close\r\n\r\nthem down\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout providing replacements would play into the \r\n\r\npro-Communists' hands, as this would only direct towards the\r\n\r\nGovernment  the  wrath of irate parents  whose  children\r\n\r\nhave  been deprived of kindergartens. Therefore, it  has\r\n\r\nbecome  necessary  to organise kindergarten  classes  in\r\n\r\ncommunity centres. Action to organise such classes along\r\n\r\nproper lines was taken at the beginning of last year. To\r\n\r\ndate, there are 129 kindergarten classes carried out  in\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres mainly those in the rural areas.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  children attending them is in the region  of\r\n\r\n3,800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make more effective the services provided\r\n\r\nby  the  community centres, it is an advantage to enlist\r\n\r\nthe  support and active participation of local community\r\n\r\nleaders  in community centre activities. Experience  has\r\n\r\nshown  that such support and participation are essential\r\n\r\nto the success of a centre in organising a wide range of\r\n\r\nactivities  to  meet the varied needs of the  community.\r\n\r\nThe   People's   Association   has   formed   Management\r\n\r\nCommittees  consisting of local community leadership  so\r\n\r\nthat  their support and guidance for the benefit of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  could be placed on a regular basis.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  local leaders forming the Management Committees are\r\n\r\npeople  who  are residents in the neighbourhood  of  the\r\n\r\nrespective community centres and they are not members of\r\n\r\nthe Corporation within the meaning of section 10 (2) (b)\r\n\r\nof   the   People's  Association  Ordinance,  1960.   In\r\n\r\nconsidering the great number of centres involved and the\r\n\r\nnumber of members for each Management Committee, ranging\r\n\r\nfrom  seven  to fourteen, it would not be  possible,  in\r\n\r\npractice, to appoint only members of the Corporation  to\r\n\r\nbe  members of Management Committees, as provided  under\r\n\r\nthat  section. Amendment to the Ordinance is accordingly\r\n\r\nnecessary.  I may mention, in passing, that a Conference\r\n\r\nof  Management Committees will be held on 8th January to\r\n\r\n10th January at the Conference Hall in Shenton Way, when\r\n\r\nall  aspects  of  community centre  management  will  be\r\n\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have briefly indicated some of the main\r\n\r\ndevelopments  of  the Association during  the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears, a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreflection of the changing dimensions of the  task  that\r\n\r\nhas  to  be performed by the Association.

As a  reward  all\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament, including the Opposition Members,\r\n\r\nare  given  $500  tax-free allowance.  If  there  is  no\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, there will be no such allowance\r\n\r\nfor  anybody.  Since  Members  have  the  privilege   of\r\n\r\nreceiving   such   allowances,   it   is   also    their\r\n\r\nresponsibility   to   serve  the   people   as   genuine\r\n\r\nParliamentarians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the policy adopted by the Barisan Sosialis to\r\n\r\nboycott  this  Session  of  Parliament  is  utterly  an\r\n\r\ninsult  as well as a challenge to the whole process  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy. I would like to  substantiate\r\n\r\nthis  because  what  I have said  is  nothing  but  the\r\n\r\ntruth.  I would like to quote the organ of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,   the  Plebeian  Express  dated  mid-December\r\n\r\n1965. Page 5 of the Plebeian Express states here:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the middle of the last century, the House of\r\n\r\nCommons  was  a  centre of real political  power  where\r\n\r\nimportant  decisions  on policy  and  legislation  were\r\n\r\nmade.  Since those days the growth in the power of  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  based  on  development  of  the  modern  party\r\n\r\nsystem  has  brought  about a fundamental  change.  The\r\n\r\nHouse  continues  to  occupy the  centre  of  political\r\n\r\nstage  but merely for propaganda purposes. It has  long\r\n\r\nceased to be the centre of political power.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in another paragraph in the same issue of the\r\n\r\nPlebeian, at page 8, it is stated:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`At the most it is a forum of criticism of the\r\n\r\nGovernment, for ventilation of grievances and for the\r\n\r\nextraction of information. This revealed that the\r\n\r\ncentral power does not lie in the House of Commons as\r\n\r\ncommonly believed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pro-Communist Barisan Sosialis have clearly\r\n\r\nstated here that this House is not important at all, and\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  only a forum for political propaganda  and\r\n\r\nnothing much could be done in this House. They have gone\r\n\r\nto  the extent of saying that they even do not wish this\r\n\r\nHouse  to exist. Therefore, this speaks for itself - that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  want to turn  Singapore  into  a\r\n\r\nCommunist State based on the bible of Karl Marx. They do\r\n\r\nnot want\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\na  democratic  system to prevail in  Singapore.  So  the\r\n\r\nboycott is one way to attain their political aims. It is\r\n\r\nsimple logic that once they boycott this Parliament,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  more admirable for them to \"boycott\" the  $500\r\n\r\ntax-free allowance too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have claimed time and again that\r\n\r\nthey  are  the only angels that represent the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But by their boycotting of this Session,  it\r\n\r\nhas cast a shadow of doubt on whether they are really or\r\n\r\ngenuinely  representing the people. If  not,  they  must\r\n\r\nsubmit  to  the  fact  that they  are  nothing  but  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the poorly butchered  Partai  Komunis\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer again to another paragraph of the\r\n\r\nPlebeian, dated December 1965, page 12, which states  as\r\n\r\nfollows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The P.A.P. hopes to use the parliamentary Session to\r\n\r\nconfuse  and  deceive  the people with  its  propaganda,\r\n\r\ndistortions,    lies    and   fabrications.    In    the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,   attending  the   coming   parliamentary\r\n\r\nSession  in  Singapore  would mean  giving  support  and\r\n\r\nrespectability to the P.A.P. ... and in helping,  wittingly\r\n\r\nor  unwittingly, the pro-imperialist P.A.P. to  deceive\r\n\r\nthe  people with all its deceptive talk of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, would have lent credence and support  to  the\r\n\r\nphoney independence of Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if it is true that the P.A.P. really confuse and\r\n\r\ndeceive  the  people,  and if the Barisan  Sosialis  are\r\n\r\nreally  or  genuinely responsible  birds  and  have  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the people at heart, then they should  come\r\n\r\nforward  and express their views in this House.  Instead\r\n\r\nthey have chosen to run away from the open argument  and\r\n\r\ndare not face the truth. The whole trouble with them  is\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  never be voted to form  the  Government\r\n\r\nbecause the people know that they are a useless lot  and\r\n\r\nhave  no  ability  to govern.

However, in a constitutional  State\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Government  honours its  Constitution,  such\r\n\r\nallowances  will  be continued to be paid.

This spirit  of  a\r\n\r\nplural society - multi-lingual, multi-cultural and \r\n\r\nmulti-religious should not only he confined to our people  but\r\n\r\nshould be disseminated to people all over the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aims of our Parliament are as I have expounded\r\n\r\njust  now,  the  people  must possess  those  qualities.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament must debate a  subject  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the  people  as a  whole,  while  you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, act as the guardian of Parliament.

On looking up that  word  in\r\n\r\nthe dictionary, I came across the word \"alligator\" which\r\n\r\nmeans \"crocodile\", if it means \"crocodile\", so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe it; it does not matter, so long as all my speeches in\r\n\r\nthis  Parliament are for the benefit of our multi-racial\r\n\r\npeople. I quote paragraph 3 of the Utusan Melayu of 16th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1965:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He then mentioned the speech of Tun Razak which\r\n\r\nappeared  in  the  Utusan  Melayu  quoted  from   Malaya\r\n\r\nMerdeka. Tun Razak considered the policy speech  of  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara as an old film.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it goes on to another paragraph. But in our Official\r\n\r\nReport,  Volume 24, No. 3, page 20, line 12,  after  the\r\n\r\nwords  \"old film\", the Member for Geylang Serai  said  a\r\n\r\nlittle  more  but  this  did not appear  in  the  Utusan\r\n\r\nMelayu. What he said was:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But they will realise that with the victory achieved\r\n\r\nrecently in the by-election in Rahang ----`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, you, Mr Speaker, called him to order;\r\n\r\nthis  was  reported  in  tire Utusan  Melayu  correctly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the word \"Rahang\" is not pleasant to the ears of\r\n\r\ncertain  parties  with the result that  his  speech  was\r\n\r\nbelittled.  After you pulled him up,  he  stood  up  and\r\n\r\ncontinued speaking:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This proves that the people of Malaysia are aware\r\n\r\nthat what the people of Singapore have achieved will  be\r\n\r\ngood for them...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This part of the speech was not reported in the Utusan\r\n\r\nMelayu,  but it does appear in our Official Report.  The\r\n\r\nreport in Utusan Melayu is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No sooner had Mr Speaker pulled him up than Inche\r\n\r\nRahamat sat down and did not continue his speech.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, they wish to indulge in \"twists\" even\r\n\r\non  proceedings  in the Parliament of  the  Republic  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If they confine themselves to  \"twists\",  it\r\n\r\ndoes not matter, but they continue to \"shake\". If it  is\r\n\r\na  hand-shake,  then we accept it. I am  at  a  loss  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the aims of Utusan Melayu. I hope  they  will\r\n\r\nrealise  that  peace cannot be endangered.  Let  us  not\r\n\r\ndiscuss Utusan Melayu with its \"old film\". I will  bring\r\n\r\nout  a  \"new film\" in the issue of the Utusan Melayu  of\r\n\r\n21st December, 1965, page 3, column 3.

Originally I thought the heading in the\r\n\r\nUtusan Melayu was for the benefit of \"polo\", but\r\n\r\nactually it is for the facilities for the Southern\r\n\r\nIslanders, because the word spelt in Jawi - \"pa-wow \r\n\r\nlam-wow\" - can be pronounced as \"polo\" as well as \"pulau\".\r\n\r\nThe news item in the Utusan Melayu reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Singapore Government spent the sum of $232 from\r\n\r\n1962  to  1965 to provide facilities for the inhabitants\r\n\r\nof  the  Southern Islands.

I  am\r\n\r\nangry,  because  I personally heard the  speech  of  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the  Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  on Saturday, 18th December,  1965,  on  the\r\n\r\noccasion  of the official opening of the jetty  east  of\r\n\r\nBukom  Kechil  by the Minister of State  for  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Department,  who  is  also  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands. I heard very well  that  the  sum  of\r\n\r\n$99,300  was  spent in 1964 and that  $77,970  has  been\r\n\r\nspent  for  1965,  making a total of  $177,270  for  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of two years 1964/1965. This covers a period  of\r\n\r\nonly two years, because prior to 1964 the votes were not\r\n\r\nunder  the jurisdiction of the Urban and Rural  Services\r\n\r\nCommittee.  This  relates to a  news  item  outside  the\r\n\r\nParliament.  But  what  I  am  discussing  here  is  how\r\n\r\nproceedings of Parliament should be reported  faithfully\r\n\r\nand in a responsible manner to preserve the peace of the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no objection even if the\r\n\r\nnews were to be blacked out.

The reporters referred\r\n\r\nto  are  from  the newspaper, the Utusan  Melayu.

At  this  stage,\r\n\r\nthe  Speaker  pulled  him  up  because  his  speech  had\r\n\r\ndeviated  from  the original motion.

If we examine  our  Official\r\n\r\nReport  of  the  proceedings of this Parliament  on  the\r\n\r\nspeech which I made on 14th December, we can clearly see\r\n\r\nthat  a  lot  of  my  speech has been \"twisted\"  by  the\r\n\r\nreporters concerned with a nefarious object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel very sorry because I spoke in Malay and the\r\n\r\nreporter himself is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalay  from the Utusan Melayu.

The people of Singapore have\r\n\r\nlived  in  peace and harmony for hundreds of years.  We,\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore,  do  not  wish  to  see  the\r\n\r\nincidents  of  July  and September  1964  re-enacted  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

Even in\r\n\r\ncolonial  times,  when  British  interest  required  the\r\n\r\nseverance of Singapore in order that it should exist  as\r\n\r\na  separate political and constitutional unit  from  the\r\n\r\nformer  Malayan  Union, which became the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  hostel  facilities for  Malayan  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nstudents   studying  abroad  had  always  been   jointly\r\n\r\nprovided.  Malaysia Hall in London, which  was  formerly\r\n\r\nknown  as  Malaya  Hall, had not  only  provided  hostel\r\n\r\naccommodation  for both Singapore and  Malayan  students\r\n\r\nhut  it  was also a meeting place of students both  from\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students whether from the island of Singapore or\r\n\r\nthe Malay peninsula have never regarded themselves other\r\n\r\nthan  as one people. The student associations which they\r\n\r\nformed and run had for more than one generation, been on\r\n\r\na  pan-Malayan  basis,  that is to  say,  there  was  no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination in the membership between those who  came\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore and those from the Malayan  mainland - \r\n\r\neveryone  was regarded as a \"Malayan\". This is  true  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan  Students' Union and the Malayan  Forum  in\r\n\r\nLondon which were formed nearly two decades ago. One  of\r\n\r\nthe  leaders  of the Malayan Forum happened  to  be  Tun\r\n\r\nRazak during his student days. This is also true of  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Society of Great Britain which later  became  the\r\n\r\nKesatuan  Melayu United Kingdom (the K.M.U.K.),  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  founders of which happened to be Tunku Abdul Rahman\r\n\r\nhimself during his student days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was in these student associations which had\r\n\r\ntheir  meeting place in Malaysia Hall that some  of  the\r\n\r\npresent leaders of both Singapore and Malaysia had first\r\n\r\nmet as students. As stated by our Deputy Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Hall held memories for him and his colleagues,\r\n\r\nand it was there that political thinking on independence\r\n\r\nfor Malaya and the reunification of Malaya and Singapore\r\n\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to remind the House of the news\r\n\r\nexpressed  by the Prime Minister of Malaysia soon  after\r\n\r\nSingapore's separation from Malaysia. He was reported to\r\n\r\nhave  said that he was happy to note that students  from\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia would continue united in  Britain\r\n\r\nand  Eire  in  spite of the political changes  at  home.\r\n\r\nHowever  it  is  also significant that the  decision  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  hostel  facilities to Singapore  students  was\r\n\r\ntaken at a top level meeting of the Alliance Council  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur where, in the same meeting, the  important\r\n\r\ndecision  to  open  their  Party  membership  direct  to\r\n\r\nindividuals  who do not belong either to  U.M.N.O.,  the\r\n\r\nM.C.A. or  the  M.I.C. was taken. One cannot  therefore\r\n\r\ndismiss this latest move as something routine, logically\r\n\r\nfollowing on the political separation of Singapore  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia. It is certainly a decision with deep political\r\n\r\novertones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can one argue that this is just a matter of hostel\r\n\r\nfacilities   for   Malaysian   students   abroad   being\r\n\r\ninadequate, as the Straits Times editorial puts  it?  If\r\n\r\nit  is  only a matter of hostel facilities abroad  being\r\n\r\ninadequate, the correct solution should be to expand the\r\n\r\nexisting  facilities by acquiring  more  hostels.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  sure our Government will be more than willing  to\r\n\r\nbear  a fair share of the capital expenditure that  this\r\n\r\nwill  entail.  As  a matter of fact, our  Government  is\r\n\r\ncontributing  a  sum  of $150,000 towards  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nrunning Malaysia Hall without even having any say in the\r\n\r\nrunning of it. No such approaches have been made to  our\r\n\r\nGovernment. The fact that our Government is bearing part\r\n\r\nof  the  cost of running Malaysia Hall requires, out  of\r\n\r\ncommon  courtesy, that we should be consulted  before  a\r\n\r\ndecision   is   taken  to  deny  our   students   hostel\r\n\r\nfacilities.  But  no  such thing  was  done  before  the\r\n\r\nunilateral  announcement  was  made  by  the   so-called\r\n\r\nMalaysian Alliance Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was further argued by the Straits Times editorial\r\n\r\nof  the  22nd  of  December that no doubt  the  Alliance\r\n\r\nCouncil  was influenced in its decision by the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment's  action that, as from  next  year  onwards,\r\n\r\nMalaysian students in Singapore in primary and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecondary schools have to pay unsubsidised school  fees.\r\n\r\nOn  this decision of our Government, I wish to point out\r\n\r\nthat  it  is based purely on finance and economics,  for\r\n\r\nSingapore being a small country cannot and should not be\r\n\r\nexpected  to pay or subsidise the education of  children\r\n\r\nof  citizens  of  her bigger neighbour. Further,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant to note that our Government by this action  is\r\n\r\nnot  in  any  way  denying  educational  facilities   to\r\n\r\nMalaysian  students  as  in the case  of  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nAlliance  Council decision of denying hostel  facilities\r\n\r\nto  our students. As I have stated, our Government  will\r\n\r\nbe willing to pay for these hostel facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that only the other day, our\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture and Social  Affairs  spoke  at  a\r\n\r\nluncheon  given  by the Lion's Club in  honour  of  five\r\n\r\nvisiting   Malaysian  students  to  Singapore   on   the\r\n\r\ndesirability  of  exchange of students between  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  Singapore. He stated that this was one of the  ways\r\n\r\nof   promoting   good  relationship  between   the   two\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now refer to some of the views expressed by the\r\n\r\nstudents  who  are directly affected by this  deplorable\r\n\r\nmove  as it was reported in the Press. Sir, I am quoting\r\n\r\nfrom the Malay Mail dated 21st December:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"Reactionary\" was the description given to the\r\n\r\ndecision by an Ipoh woman law student who is an official\r\n\r\nof one of the student associations.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continue to quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"It's a very unfair move against our students\r\n\r\nabroad,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"During the past year, we Malaysian and Singapore\r\n\r\nstudents  in  Britain  and Eire  have  tried  to  remain\r\n\r\nunited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This decision shatters all our hopes and aspirations\r\n\r\nof  maintaining unity and working towards the  formation\r\n\r\nof   a  single  Malaysian-Singapore  Students  Union  in\r\n\r\nBritain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another association official, also a Malaysian,\r\n\r\nexpressed a similar view. He said: \"It's a wedge in  the\r\n\r\nhearts  of  students who have over the years aspired  to\r\n\r\nbelong  to  a single family. We deplore the government's\r\n\r\naction.\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of the London Union of Malaysian and\r\n\r\nSingapore   students,  Tengku  Noone,   also   expressed\r\n\r\nsurprise and regret and has this to say: \"When Singapore\r\n\r\nparted  from Malaysia, the Tengku praised the union  for\r\n\r\nsaying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  would  continue  to promote good  relations  between\r\n\r\nMalaysian and Singapore students and that the government\r\n\r\nitself  would  endeavour to promote  this  undertaking.\" [Malay Mail, 21-12-65]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Malaysian Alliance do not think it fit to\r\n\r\nseek  the views of our Government on this issue, perhaps\r\n\r\nthey should consult and listen to the views of their own\r\n\r\nMalaysian  students, particularly  the  leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  student associations abroad, since it has  been\r\n\r\ntheir  constant protestations of being model  democrats.\r\n\r\nBy  this far-reaching move of theirs, they have not only\r\n\r\narrogated to themselves the right to shape the lives not\r\n\r\nonly of the present generation but also of the next, for\r\n\r\nthe   present  student  leaders  are  bound  to  be  the\r\n\r\npolitical leaders of the next generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, one cannot help viewing this move by the\r\n\r\nM.A.C. as  one  designed  to close  the  minds  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian   students   from   any   outside   influence,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  ideas of freedom of  thought,  \r\n\r\nmulti-racialism,  multi-lingualism that are  being  encouraged\r\n\r\nand  practised  in our country Singapore.  Perhaps  they\r\n\r\nfear  the  meeting of minds with the Singapore  students\r\n\r\nwho  are  being  brought  up in such  an  atmosphere  of\r\n\r\nfreedom, just as they fear the plague carrier who  might\r\n\r\ninfect  the  Malaysian  students  in  these  \"subversive\r\n\r\nideas\"  and end up in destroying the fabric of  Alliance\r\n\r\npower in Malaysia. One begins to wonder whether this  is\r\n\r\nnot  the first step towards the development of a  closed\r\n\r\nsociety  of  one race, one language, one  religion  and,\r\n\r\nabove all, one idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore can only view such moves towards\r\n\r\nperdition  with  sadness. Perhaps it would  not  be  too\r\n\r\ninappropriate  for me to remind them that  however  much\r\n\r\nyou  can achieve in separating people physically,  ideas\r\n\r\ncan  never  be  isolated or killed.  We  have  too  many\r\n\r\nexamples of such determined but unsuccessful attempts in\r\n\r\nworld  history. We saw the campaign in Hitlerite Germany\r\n\r\nof the burning of books; and in more recent history, the\r\n\r\nnotorious Berlin Wall. Ironically, it was only the other\r\n\r\nday that the Tunku was castigating the Opposition in the\r\n\r\nMalaysian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament  by  accusing them of adopting Hitlerite  and\r\n\r\nCommunist tactics. One wonders where the cap fits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, in the event of our good advice not being\r\n\r\nheeded  and if they still persist in denying the use  of\r\n\r\nsuch  facilities  to  our  students  abroad,  will   our\r\n\r\nGovernment immediately set up a Singapore Hall  so  that\r\n\r\nour  students can be accorded hostel facilities and  not\r\n\r\nbe left stranded? Perhaps when we have our own Singapore\r\n\r\nHall,  I  am  positive that the door to such  facilities\r\n\r\nwill  be  left  wide  open  for  brother  students  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed AI-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   it  seems  that  the  question  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nstudents in London is not only heard in this House,  but\r\n\r\nit  is  also  heard in the Dewan Negara as stated  in  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper  today --- the Utusan Melayu, page  6,  headed\r\n\r\n\"Students of Singapore in Dewan Raayat at\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister for Lands and Mines said that it is the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Malaysian Government to look after\r\n\r\nour students abroad.

An  increase  in this amount  may  give  rise  to\r\n\r\nvandalism  by  drivers  who  often  take  advantage   of\r\n\r\nbreakdowns  to  stay idle. There are common  allegations\r\n\r\nagainst  our Government drivers, though these  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen   substantiated,  that  they   deliberately   cause\r\n\r\nbreakdowns  and  send  their  vehicles  to  the  P.W.D.,\r\n\r\nKallang, for repair, so that they can stay idle.  As  to\r\n\r\nwhy  these drivers intentionally cause these breakdowns.\r\n\r\nI  am afraid there is no need for me to mention here the\r\n\r\nreasons, which are best known to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As their services are essential and important, we can\r\n\r\nhardly afford to go without them in our daily life.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  drivers  of the  Health  Department,  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D.,  the  Social Welfare Department, the  Veterinary\r\n\r\nDepartment, etc. provide valuable services to the public\r\n\r\nevery  day.  Since  our  Government  cannot  afford   to\r\n\r\nmaintain   many   vehicles,   readily   available,    as\r\n\r\nreplacements in cases of breakdown, I sincerely urge the\r\n\r\nheads of departments concerned to exercise greater  care\r\n\r\nby supervising the drivers in order to bring down to the\r\n\r\nminimum  the consequential cost of repairs and accidents\r\n\r\ninvolving Government vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law and National Development\r\n\r\n(Mr  E. W.  Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first explain\r\n\r\nthat this  vote  is  to  cover the cost of damages  to  other\r\n\r\nvehicles  which have come into collision with Government\r\n\r\nvehicles. Government vehicles are not insured,  so  that\r\n\r\nthis  item  is to provide for all damages  that  may  he\r\n\r\ncaused  to other vehicles, the damage having been caused\r\n\r\nand the accident having arisen due to the negligence  of\r\n\r\nour  own  drivers. The increase of $5,500 for this  item\r\n\r\nhas  come about through the separation of Singapore from\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  As a result of the separation, many vehicles,\r\n\r\nwhich  prior  to Malaysia Day belonged to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment, revert to the Government of Singapore  after\r\n\r\nSingapore  Day. So with the increase in  the  number  of\r\n\r\nGovern  ment  vehicles  in  Singapore,  this  item   has\r\n\r\nincreased by $5,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the allegations of sabotage, there has been no\r\n\r\nevidence  of this. But whenever a Government driver  has\r\n\r\nbeen  grossly  negligent, disciplinary proceedings  have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken against him. In fact, in the past few years,\r\n\r\na  few  drivers  have been dismissed  because  of  gross\r\n\r\nnegligence. I can assure the hon. Member for Mountbatten\r\n\r\nthat  this figure has not been increased because  of  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  number  of accidents  or  more  heavy\r\n\r\nsabotage by our own drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $820,850 for Head 0105 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0301\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0301 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead 1015.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, citizenship is very important to\r\n\r\neverybody,  because if a person has  citizenship  he  is\r\n\r\nentitled  to  all  facilities  and  amenities,  such  as\r\n\r\neducation, social welfare, housing and the enjoyment  of\r\n\r\nfree  medical attention.

There  was   expansion   of\r\n\r\nfacilities both from an operational and commercial point\r\n\r\nof  view.  The  standard of service  was  high  and  the\r\n\r\nintegrity of the Department of Civil Aviation staff  was\r\n\r\nunquestioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Singapore became part of Malaysia in September\r\n\r\n1963,  when  the  control  of the  Department  of  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation  was  vested with the Kuala Lumpur  Government,\r\n\r\nthe amenities provided for passengers and members of the\r\n\r\npublic  meeting passengers at Singapore Airport leave  a\r\n\r\nvery great deal to be desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of serious criticisms have been levelled at\r\n\r\nthe  Airport  Administration, and I feel it  my  bounden\r\n\r\nduty  to  voice it here, with the hope that  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  will  inquire and  take  the  necessary\r\n\r\naction to put things right. During the last two years  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of senior officials of the Department  of  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation  have accepted complimentary air trips  offered\r\n\r\nby  foreign airlines for their personal pleasure.  These\r\n\r\nofficials  include the Director of Civil  Aviation,  Mr\r\n\r\nTan  Beng San, the Airport Manager, Mr Devan,  and  the\r\n\r\nAirport officer-in-charge of the Police, Ungku Adam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an independent Singapore, the same officials will\r\n\r\nbe responsible for negotiating traffic rights granted to\r\n\r\nforeign  operators,  very possibly  those  same  foreign\r\n\r\noperators who have extended hospitality to the officials\r\n\r\nconcerned in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Department of Civil Aviation. Acceptance  of  these\r\n\r\nfavours,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, will no doubt weaken  their\r\n\r\nnegotiating  power  in protecting the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1964 the new Passenger Terminal Building was\r\n\r\nopened. Before it was opened, various airlines operating\r\n\r\nthrough  Singapore  protested to the Director  of  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation,  Mr Tan Beng San, about the manner  in  which\r\n\r\nthe   restaurant  had  been  run  in  the  old  terminal\r\n\r\nbuilding.  These  airlines made  strong  representations\r\n\r\nthat  the  concession  for the  restaurant  in  the  new\r\n\r\nterminal building should not be given to the same person\r\n\r\nby  the name of Mr Neo Tai Kim, who exercised the right\r\n\r\nin  the  old terminal building, on the grounds  of  very\r\n\r\ninferior   service  and  malpractices.  However,   these\r\n\r\nrepresentations  were ignored by the Director  of  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation,  Mr  Tan Beng San, and the airline  operators\r\n\r\nwere most disappointed at this. And to crown it all, the\r\n\r\nD.C.A. saw fit to grant a further concession to operate\r\n\r\nthe  duty-free  liquor and cigarette  shop  at  the  new\r\n\r\nterminal  building.  This  new company  called  Sharikat\r\n\r\nMalaysia, which was formed to conduct this business, had\r\n\r\nno  previous  experience in the handling of  liquor  and\r\n\r\ncigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to touch on the Airport restaurant.\r\n\r\nThis  is let out on the basis of a concession, but after\r\n\r\n10  p.m, each  evening it functions as  a  night  club,\r\n\r\nremaining  open  until the small hours of  the  morning,\r\n\r\nlong  after  other such establishments in Singapore  are\r\n\r\nclosed.  During  the  day  the prices  charged  in  this\r\n\r\nrestaurant are excessive, particularly for refreshments.\r\n\r\nFor example, the price of a cup of coffee or a bottle of\r\n\r\ncoca-cola is 60 cents. For a public place like Singapore\r\n\r\nAirport,  where the concession is virtually a  monopoly,\r\n\r\nthe   charge   of  60  cents  is,  to  say  the   least,\r\n\r\nextortionate. Surely it is unthinkable for the D.C.A. to\r\n\r\ngive  protection  to the concessionaire  to  fleece  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When evening comes and the restaurant is turned into a\r\n\r\nnight  club,  prices  are  increased  further  and   the\r\n\r\npremises are crowded with large numbers of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyoungsters  who are aware that the premises remain  open\r\n\r\nuntil the early hours of the morning. During this period\r\n\r\nit  is  very difficult for passengers and persons having\r\n\r\nessential business at the Airport to obtain service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to say here that I am\r\n\r\nnot  against the operation of a night club, but  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat with the restricted facilities at the Airport where\r\n\r\nthe  place  is meant as a restaurant for passengers  who\r\n\r\nuse  the Airport, the night club, if it has got to be  a\r\n\r\nnight  club, can be operated elsewhere. In this respect,\r\n\r\nI   would  also  like  to  quote  the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nrecommendation that night clubs should be for foreigners\r\n\r\nso  that  we  can  earn their money but  our  youngsters\r\n\r\nshould  go to bed early and have physical jerks  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning so that they can keep fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the granting of concessions is decided by a\r\n\r\nCommittee  under the chairmanship of Mr Tan  Beng  San.\r\n\r\nSurely  in  an area as important as this, a high-powered\r\n\r\ncommittee  should be established and advice sought  from\r\n\r\nairlines  and  other  commercial  concerns  prior  to  a\r\n\r\nconcession  being  granted. Surely also  some  provision\r\n\r\nshould be made for persons tendering for concessions  to\r\n\r\nguarantee that the price levels at the Airport will  not\r\n\r\nexceed general prices in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Deputy Prime Minister to review the\r\n\r\ncomposition of the Airport Commercial Committee and have\r\n\r\nit  reconstituted, so that there can be  proper  control\r\n\r\nover all the various aspects of commercial activities at\r\n\r\nSingapore Airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various shops at the Airport are let out on\r\n\r\nconcession,  and the prices charged in these  shops  are\r\n\r\ngenerally  higher than those charged  in  the  city.  In\r\n\r\nparticular,  transit passengers shopping in the  Transit\r\n\r\nLounge   frequently   complain   about   price   levels,\r\n\r\nparticularly   those   passengers   who,   on   previous\r\n\r\noccasions,  have  actually stopped  over  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nPassengers who regularly transit at Singapore frequently\r\n\r\nask their friends to do their purchasing in the City and\r\n\r\nbring the goods to the Airport, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  know that the prices charged in the Airport  shops\r\n\r\nare excessive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of what I have said and in\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the public and the country, I urge  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister seriously to consider  conducting\r\n\r\nan  inquiry into the activities of the Director of Civil\r\n\r\nAviation,  Mr Tan Beng San, and the commercial  aspects\r\n\r\nof  the  Department  of  Civil  Aviation,  and  to  take\r\n\r\nappropriate  action  against  the  person   or   persons\r\n\r\nresponsible for the maladministration. It surely must be\r\n\r\nthe  objective  of  the Government to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Airport  is  a showpiece  and  an  attractive\r\n\r\ngateway  for  tourist  traffic  visiting  the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I close, Mr Speaker, Sir, the irons of all\r\n\r\nthis is that the Airport restaurant concession is run by\r\n\r\na  Mr  Neo  Tai Kim. The duty-free liquor and cigarette\r\n\r\nshop  licensee is also a Mr Neo Tai Kim. I believe this\r\n\r\nMr  Neo Tai Kim also operates the Shamrock Hotel  which\r\n\r\nis  in  my constituency. It is a bit fishy when  I  find\r\n\r\nthat  officials of the Department of Civil Aviation have\r\n\r\nparties at the Shamrock Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank the\r\n\r\nMember for River Valley for drawing my attention to  all\r\n\r\nthe deficiencies in the administration of the Airport. I\r\n\r\nmust say that the responsibility for Civil Aviation left\r\n\r\nmy charge for the last two years when Singapore was part\r\n\r\nof Malaysia. It became the responsibility of the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment of Malaysia and it was only recently that the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   for  administering  the   Airport   has\r\n\r\nreverted  back  to me. Being occupied  with  other  more\r\n\r\nurgent  matters.  I have been unable to  look  into  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  which  have  been  registered  against   the\r\n\r\nadministration  at the Airport. But the allegations  the\r\n\r\nMember  has made are quite serious and I will  certainly\r\n\r\nlook  into  them  and rectify whatever maladministration\r\n\r\nhas taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to clarify, not only to the Member but also\r\n\r\nto the House, that in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  far  as  the granting of traffic rights  to  airline\r\n\r\noperators  is  concerned, ultimately it is the  Minister\r\n\r\nwho  has the responsibility of signing the agreement and\r\n\r\nlooking  into the clauses of the agreement.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nquite  correct to say that officials at the Airport  are\r\n\r\nresponsible for negotiating traffic rights. They have no\r\n\r\nsuch responsibility at all. It is the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nmy  officials,  who  are  in my  Headquarters,  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do admit that I have also heard from other transit\r\n\r\npassengers,  who  have  passed through  Singapore,  that\r\n\r\nshops in the transit lounge leave much to be desired. In\r\n\r\nfact,  when  I  was in Moscow, my interpreter,  a  young\r\n\r\nRussian,  was on his way back to Moscow from Jakarta - he\r\n\r\nwas transiting in Singapore - and he visited the shops  in\r\n\r\nthe  transit lounge and bought a radio, and when he went\r\n\r\nback  to  Moscow he found that he could not even receive\r\n\r\nRadio  Moscow.  He  sent  his  transistor  radio  to  he\r\n\r\nexamined  and  it  was found that the insides  were  all\r\n\r\nrusty  although the brand was a very famous  brand.  The\r\n\r\nman  was evidently very much cut up and I am afraid that\r\n\r\nsuch  oneupsmanship on transit passengers by shopkeepers\r\n\r\nin Singapore is going to do themselves no good and do  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable amount of harm to our reputation as  honest\r\n\r\ntraders and dealers. This is not the only story  I  have\r\n\r\nheard.  In  fact, it was heard somewhere else in  Africa\r\n\r\ntoo.  Somebody had bought a watch with a reputable  name\r\n\r\non  the face of tile watch. But after one week the watch\r\n\r\nrefused  to work. He opened up the watch and found  that\r\n\r\nits  mechanism was not what it was supposed  to  be;  it\r\n\r\ncame  from a cheap company. All in all, I must say  that\r\n\r\nthis  fraud,  which is perpetrated on  tourists  and  on\r\n\r\npeople  who  pass  through Singapore,  is  damaging  our\r\n\r\nreputation. This fraud, if it exists, must certainly  he\r\n\r\nstopped, and I will make it a point to see what is going\r\n\r\non  in the transit lounge. Certainly if it is discovered\r\n\r\nthat  shopkeepers in the transit lounge  are  trying  to\r\n\r\ndefraud  transit passengers who are in  a  hurry  to  do\r\n\r\ntheir  purchases, then the licence which has been  given\r\n\r\nto  them for opening shops in the transit lounge will be\r\n\r\ncancelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the Airport restaurant is concerned, I\r\n\r\nfind  it  very difficult indeed to see what can be  done\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  the prices which are  charged  by  the\r\n\r\nAirport  restaurant  for drinks,  Coca  Cola  and  other\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs.  The restaurant is allowed to operate  on  a\r\n\r\ntender  fee,  and there is no condition imposed  to  say\r\n\r\nthat the operator must fix a certain price for the sales\r\n\r\nof  drinks.  Just as much as a licence  is  given  to  a\r\n\r\ncoffee shop in town to operate an eating shop, I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  there is any law to say that the owner must  sell\r\n\r\nhis  soft  drinks at 25 cents a bottle  or  20  cents  a\r\n\r\nbottle.  The price of drinks must, of course, be related\r\n\r\nto  the  cost of production and the number of  customers\r\n\r\nwho patronise it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair to the Director of Civil Aviation, the\r\n\r\nMember for River Valley ought not to blame him as  being\r\n\r\nthe  evil man who has granted concessions to Neo Tai Kim\r\n\r\nand  others,  because  he himself has  admitted  that  a\r\n\r\nCommittee  studies  all  applications  and  it  is   the\r\n\r\nCommittee  which makes the decision, although  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthe  Director of Civil Aviation is the Chairman of  this\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was rather curious indeed when I listened to the\r\n\r\nMember  for River Valley saying that he has on occasions\r\n\r\nmet   officials   of   my   Civil  Aviation   Department\r\n\r\npatronising the Shamrock Bar which is also owned by  Neo\r\n\r\nTai   Kim  who  also  operates  the  concession  at  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Airport  Restaurant.  This  is  an  important\r\n\r\npoint, and if there is reason to believe that there  are\r\n\r\nundesirable  dealings  under  the  table  or  under  the\r\n\r\ncounter,  then  I have no hesitation in  referring  this\r\n\r\nmatter  to  the  C.P.I.B. which  will  be  qualified  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate any innuendoes or allegations of corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the House that it is the intention of the\r\n\r\nGovernment to ensure that everybody who makes use of the\r\n\r\nAirport  and  the terminal building will  be  given  all\r\n\r\nfacilities and all courtesy, because we do realise  that\r\n\r\nmore  people pass through the Airport in Singapore  than\r\n\r\nin  any other part of the State. So it is very necessary\r\n\r\nindeed  that  the  Airport, as a gateway  to  Singapore,\r\n\r\nshould  give  all  travellers a good impression  of  our\r\n\r\nintegrity and honesty, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  there are any shortcomings, I will be only too happy\r\n\r\nto hear from any Member of the House, or for that matter\r\n\r\nany member of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only add now that the Member for River Valley\r\n\r\nhas  very  usefully raised these points in this  debate,\r\n\r\nand I shall certainly look into all the allegations that\r\n\r\nhe has made this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> In view of the assurance by the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker.

As Singapore  is\r\n\r\nnow  an  independent country, it is most undesirable  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  using  the Malaysian passport longer  than  is\r\n\r\nnecessary. It is a risky business.

I refer to\r\n\r\nthe   current   arrangement  whereby  Singapore-destined\r\n\r\npassengers are required to clear immigration formalities\r\n\r\nat  the first port of entry in Malaysia and, vice versa,\r\n\r\nKuala   Lumpur-destined  passengers  in   transit   from\r\n\r\nSingapore  are required to clear immigration formalities\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  This, I understand, is not satisfactory,\r\n\r\nmore  so  now that Singapore is an independent  country.\r\n\r\nWill  the  Deputy Prime Minister please consider  taking\r\n\r\nsteps to revise the procedure?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, another item concerning immigration is\r\n\r\nthat Singapore is still\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepending  on  Malaysian and British embassies  to\r\n\r\ngrant visas or entry permits to people wishing  to\r\n\r\nenter Singapore. This procedure should be remedied\r\n\r\nas  soon  as we open up our own overseas missions.\r\n\r\nComplaints  are  being received that  applications\r\n\r\nfor  approval  for  visas  and  entry  permits  by\r\n\r\nintending  tourists and businessmen  to  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  unduly  and unnecessarily delayed at  Bangkok\r\n\r\nand  Hongkong. In view of the volume of  passenger\r\n\r\ntraffic  between these two places  and  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwould  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  consider  the\r\n\r\nposting of passport officers at these places?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, at the moment,\r\n\r\nwe  are  issuing provisional Singapore  passports,\r\n\r\nAny  person who holds a Malaysian passport or  any\r\n\r\nother  type of passport, provided he is a  citizen\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, and he wishes to change over to the\r\n\r\nSingapore passport, can do so. The main reason why\r\n\r\nwe  have  not  urged  every Singapore  citizen  to\r\n\r\nacquire a Singapore passport is simply because  of\r\n\r\nthe suddenness of Singapore being independent.  We\r\n\r\nwere  caught  flat-footed with regard to  passport\r\n\r\nfacilities,  and  we,  therefore,  arrived  at  an\r\n\r\nagreement with the Central Government of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nthat   Singapore   citizens  who  hold   Malaysian\r\n\r\npassports  could  continue to use these  passports\r\n\r\nuntil  they  expire  or until the  holder  of  the\r\n\r\npassport  wishes  to exchange it for  a  Singapore\r\n\r\npassport.  I  have  indicated just  now  that  new\r\n\r\npassports  are being ordered from abroad,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  informed that it would take about  six\r\n\r\nmonths or so for them to reach us. So we should be\r\n\r\nin a position probably some time in the early part\r\n\r\nof next year to issue normal Singapore passports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the second point raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for River Valley on immigration  clearance\r\n\r\nat  Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, I agree  with  him\r\n\r\nthat this is an established procedure. I would not\r\n\r\nsay  that  all procedures initiated by ex-colonial\r\n\r\nmasters  are  bad.  Whether  it  will  be  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of both Singapore and Malaysia  to  have\r\n\r\ndifferent  arrangements with  regard  to  clearing\r\n\r\npassengers  by  air at Kuala Lumpur and  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas to be discussed, but if it appears\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it  is necessary that we should review  this\r\n\r\nquestion, then, of course, it shall be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the issuing of visas or entry\r\n\r\npermits to those who wish to visit Singapore, I am\r\n\r\nafraid   as  far  as  overseas  applications   are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we  are  very much  dependent  on  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Embassy and the British Embassy to  help\r\n\r\nus out, for the simple reason that, at the moment,\r\n\r\nwe  just  do  not  have a single  embassy  abroad.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  have made arrangements to  allow  the\r\n\r\nTrade  Commissioner in London to issue  visas  and\r\n\r\npassports, and subsequently when we have appointed\r\n\r\na  permanent representative to the United  Nations\r\n\r\nin  New York, he also will be empowered to perform\r\n\r\nthis   function.  When  our  Ministry  of  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs  has  established our embassies  in  those\r\n\r\ncapitals - this has already been indicated - then\r\n\r\nthis  problem  will  no longer arise.  However,  I\r\n\r\nshall  look  into  the matter of taking  immediate\r\n\r\nsteps  to  find an agency or an agent in  Hongkong\r\n\r\nwho  will  be given the power of issuing visas  to\r\n\r\nthose  who  wish to visit Singapore.  However,  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  remembered that the issuing of visas  is\r\n\r\nnot  as  simple as just chopping the stamp  of  an\r\n\r\nimmigration  passport  on to  a  piece  of  paper,\r\n\r\nbecause many of these applications have to be sent\r\n\r\nback to Singapore for examination, and it may turn\r\n\r\nout  that  some of the applicants are undesirables\r\n\r\nwhom we do not wish to allow entry into Singapore.\r\n\r\nSo  if  there  is some inconvenience  due  to  the\r\n\r\ndelay, I am afraid it cannot be helped because  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  consider  the security  aspect  of  such\r\n\r\napplications also. Nevertheless, I will look  into\r\n\r\nthe  matter of expediting the issuing of visas and\r\n\r\nentry  permits at Bangkok and Hongkong  to  places\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Member for River Valley has  just  now\r\n\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,369,410 for Head 0305 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

I do not think it is fair to criticise  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  this.

These   are   the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities   of  the  entire  Police   Department.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  I may say so, the Police have  become  a\r\n\r\nvery  important and integral part of our nation. We  are\r\n\r\nliving  in a multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-lingual\r\n\r\nand multi-religious society. It is, therefore, important\r\n\r\nthat  in  the case of the Police Force we must bear  all\r\n\r\nthese  facts  in  mind. In view of this, our  Government\r\n\r\nshould introduce the policy of multi-racialism into  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force, so that it will be organised and  staffed\r\n\r\nby people of different races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out today that in the course of\r\n\r\na  nation  which  has  just achieved  independence,  the\r\n\r\npeople may have some erroneous impression of the Police.\r\n\r\nIn  this particular case, the impression that our people\r\n\r\nmay have of our Police is not very good. This impression\r\n\r\nwas  created particularly during the period when we were\r\n\r\nin Malaysia. I noted that during this period the work of\r\n\r\nthe  Police  had  been  out of  the  normal  trend.  For\r\n\r\nexample, the people and the Police must get along  well;\r\n\r\nin other words, both parties must understand each other,\r\n\r\nparticularly the Police who must understand the problems\r\n\r\nof  our  people, so that they will be able to  discharge\r\n\r\ntheir duties and responsibilities according to the needs\r\n\r\nof  the people. But, unfortunately, some members of  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force tend to forget that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  in  uniform  and  that they have  certain  specific\r\n\r\nresponsibilities to discharge; they do things which they\r\n\r\nshould  not do. For example, when some of them  on  beat\r\n\r\nduty  along  the  streets come across  a  woman  in  an\r\n\r\nattractive  dress, they whistle and make wolf-calls.  So\r\n\r\nif a foreign female tourist finds this sort of behaviour\r\n\r\nof  members of the Police Force, then it will damage the\r\n\r\nreputation  of Singapore and will show up the  stupidity\r\n\r\nof such people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to say is that Members of the Police\r\n\r\nForce must be well behaved in public, particularly so in\r\n\r\na   multi-racial,   multi-cultural  and  multi-religious\r\n\r\nsociety.  This  is very important, because,  in  certain\r\n\r\ncases,    language   barriers   may   give    rise    to\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding between members of the Police Force and\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public. I remember that when  Singapore\r\n\r\nwas  a  State of Malaysia, we had two civil disturbances\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and  the  work of  the  Police  was  very\r\n\r\nimportant  and difficult. We, of course, could  not  put\r\n\r\ntoo  much blame on them. The important point is language\r\n\r\ndifficulty. Some members of the public had reasons to go\r\n\r\noutdoors  during curfew hours. For example, in emergency\r\n\r\ncases  of  women  who  wanted to  go  to  the  maternity\r\n\r\nhospital,  their  husbands had to go  out  of  doors  to\r\n\r\nsummon  ambulance or other forms of vehicles  to  convey\r\n\r\ntheir  wives  to the hospital, and thus they  broke  the\r\n\r\ncurfew.  But  some members of the Police Force  did  not\r\n\r\nseem  to  understand their difficulties. For example,  a\r\n\r\nman  who  went  out  of doors to summon  a  taxi  or  an\r\n\r\nambulance  was  unable  to put his  point  across  to  a\r\n\r\npoliceman who did not understand his language and so  he\r\n\r\nwas taken to a police station and all the while his wife\r\n\r\nwaited for the ambulance or some car to take her to  the\r\n\r\nhospital.  Because  of  such  misunderstandings,  a  bad\r\n\r\nimpression  has been created in the minds of the  people\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Police.  And to  some  extent,  some \r\n\r\nill-feelings  have  been  created. It  is,  therefore,  very\r\n\r\nimportant for us to note that the duties of the  Police\r\n\r\nForce in independent Singapore are more onerous and more\r\n\r\nimportant than at any time in our history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge therefore that, apart from the basic\r\n\r\ntraining  that a policeman must have, say, in  training,\r\n\r\nparade and other matters of responsibility, we must also\r\n\r\ninculcate  into  their  minds  a  feeling  of  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness,  so that they will be able  to  discharge\r\n\r\ntheir  duties more efficiently and with a greater  sense\r\n\r\nof responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to emphasise is that our\r\n\r\nmulti-racial country is made up of women who constitute  about\r\n\r\nhalf  our  population.  It  is therefore  important  and\r\n\r\nnecessary  that this sex ratio in the population  should\r\n\r\nbe maintained when employing people in the Police Force.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, we must have more policewomen  in  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force.  I  understand that, although  there  are\r\n\r\npolicewomen in the Police Force, further recruitment  of\r\n\r\nwomen police constables has been suspended. I feel  that\r\n\r\nthis is not proper, because women P.C.s have done a good\r\n\r\njob,  and they have shown that they are able to  do  the\r\n\r\njobs  that a policeman normally does. They have played\r\n\r\ntheir  part in the defence and maintenance of our social\r\n\r\norder,  and so they should not be a minority section  in\r\n\r\nthe Police Force. As befitting our independent status, I\r\n\r\nurge  the Minister concerned to give further thought  to\r\n\r\nthis matter and recruit more women police constables  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  other half of our population  is  also  well\r\n\r\nrepresented in our Police Force and they will be able to\r\n\r\ndo their share and play their part in the maintenance of\r\n\r\nsocial order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, since our Party came to  power,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Police Force, which is an important arm of the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  has been re-moulded from a colonial  Police\r\n\r\nForce  into  a people's Police Force. It is  well  known\r\n\r\nthat  the  Police Force is a friend, helper and guardian\r\n\r\nof  the public. Unfortunately, during the last two years\r\n\r\nwhen  we  were  in Malaysia, the Police  Department  was\r\n\r\ntaken  over  by  the Central Government from  our  State\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Therefore,  during  those  two  years,  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force was not under our control and some officers\r\n\r\nand even the rank and file from the Federation came down\r\n\r\nhere to serve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  our Police Force. In those circumstances, we believe\r\n\r\nthat the good image of the Police Force we had built  up\r\n\r\nduring the pre-Malaysia days was erased and that  a  bad\r\n\r\nimage was created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, we are now an independent\r\n\r\ncountry and the Police Force is again controlled by  us.\r\n\r\nEvery  step  is being taken to erase the bad image  that\r\n\r\nwas  created  during the period when  Singapore  was  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  I  can assure the Member for Delta  that  our\r\n\r\nPolice Force now has gone hack to the pre-Malaysia  days\r\n\r\nwhen they gave a good impression to the people that they\r\n\r\nwere not colonial tools used to oppress and suppress the\r\n\r\npeople; they are law officers going about their duty  to\r\n\r\nhelp protect the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Delta has cited a few\r\n\r\ninstances  that  occurred  during  Malaysia  days.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  am afraid that that  was  beyond  our\r\n\r\ncontrol.  However,  if  any police  officer  misconducts\r\n\r\nhimself  now,  he  will,  of  course,  be  subjected  to\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  action. And if anyone  is  aware  of  such\r\n\r\nmisconduct,  he can report it to the police  or  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry concerned, and immediate action will be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of women police\r\n\r\nconstables, at present we have enough to cope  with  the\r\n\r\npresent  situation.

Although   many\r\n\r\ndifficulties  are encountered, I suggest  that  children\r\n\r\nshould be admitted to schools in their respective areas.\r\n\r\nCertain  difficulties may be encountered by the Ministry\r\n\r\nin  making  these arrangements, especially in regard  to\r\n\r\ntransport   facilities,  but,  as   far   as   possible,\r\n\r\narrangements  should be made for children  to  enrol  in\r\n\r\nschools  in  their  own areas. Parents  should  also  be\r\n\r\nprivileged to enrol their children in schools  of  their\r\n\r\npreference and such requests should not be refused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, regarding School inspectors. In schools of all\r\n\r\nlanguage   streams,   proper   supervision   should   be\r\n\r\nmaintained.  School Inspectors should visit  schools  to\r\n\r\nsee  for themselves how they function and make out their\r\n\r\nreports.  Experienced teachers should he transferred  to\r\n\r\nthe higher classes according to their merits, as this is\r\n\r\nthe  way  in  which  we  will be  able  to  improve  our\r\n\r\neducation system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, while beating of students should be barred. I\r\n\r\nfeel   that  students  should  respect  and  fear  their\r\n\r\nprincipals.  Teachers, however, should behave  with  due\r\n\r\nconsideration.  They should not adopt  modern  ways  and\r\n\r\nmodern  styles of dress. They should remember that  they\r\n\r\nare Asians at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the points the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  has raised is the question of  children  who\r\n\r\npass   the  Secondary  Entrance  Examination   and   are\r\n\r\ntransferred to schools which are a little too  far  away\r\n\r\nfrom  their houses. Although this situation exists,  the\r\n\r\nfact  is that it is actually a problem which concerns  a\r\n\r\nvery  small minority from among 40,000 pupils  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  transferred from primary to secondary  schools  in\r\n\r\nthe  last examination. This has been a recurring problem\r\n\r\nsimply  because  when parents have been  asked  to  make\r\n\r\nfirst,  second and third choices - as was the  case  the\r\n\r\nyear  before last, and two choices this year - they have\r\n\r\nmade their choices, and in a very small number of cases,\r\n\r\ntheir  children  have not been allotted the  schools  of\r\n\r\ntheir choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals of primary schools which presented\r\n\r\ncandidates  for  the Primary School Leaving  Examination\r\n\r\nwere  actually  instructed on the 7th of  December  this\r\n\r\nyear  to inform their pupils, who request for transfers,\r\n\r\nto  submit their applications to the Principals  of  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools  where they have  been  posted.  This\r\n\r\napplies  to cases where parents have not been satisfied,\r\n\r\nand  invariably they have not been satisfied because the\r\n\r\nschools are too far away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application forms may be obtained from principals of\r\n\r\nthe  secondary schools concerned from the 3rd of January\r\n\r\nto the 7th of January, 1966, that is five days after the\r\n\r\nschools reopen for the New Year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to add\r\n\r\nthat  parents naturally are anxious to know whether they\r\n\r\nhave  to buy textbooks for their children who have  been\r\n\r\nso  promoted to Secondary 1. Well, in cases  where  they\r\n\r\nare  not satisfied with the schools where their children\r\n\r\nhave been sent to, they need not buy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntextbooks  until they have made fresh appeals for  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to  be  transferred to  schools  nearer  their\r\n\r\nhomes. Also they need not make school uniforms for their\r\n\r\nchildren  because of the uncertainty of  their  children\r\n\r\nbeing  transferred to some other school or back to their\r\n\r\nold school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson was worried about school teachers\r\n\r\nwearing  modern dress. I did not hear him  actually  say\r\n\r\nwearing  drainpipe trousers. I do not exactly know  what\r\n\r\nhe meant by the word \"modern\" - whether the clothes are\r\n\r\nof  the  transparent type - very \"flimsy voile\" a  term\r\n\r\nused  by  textile merchants - or with very  low-plunging\r\n\r\nnecklines.  Also I do not know whether he was  referring\r\n\r\nto  men or women teachers in the schools. At any rate  a\r\n\r\nfew  years ago, I read complaints along these  lines  in\r\n\r\nthe  Utusan Melayu (that is before it became an U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nnewspaper)  from  readers, parents  and  others  against\r\n\r\nMalay  school  teachers who were fond  of  wearing  Baju\r\n\r\nKebaya   which   is  very  transparent.   However,   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  think  the  complaint  is  not  all  that\r\n\r\nwidespread. As a matter of fact, this is the first  time\r\n\r\nthat I have heard of such a complaint, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  complaints are made to  the  Ministry,  we\r\n\r\nshall deal with them. But I have full confidence in  our\r\n\r\nteachers.  Probably the Member for  Anson  saw  them  in\r\n\r\ntheir  off-duty hours along Changi Beach. He might  have\r\n\r\nrecognised them as teachers in Singapore, but  I  should\r\n\r\nthink  that  in their classrooms, in their work  places,\r\n\r\nthey wear very appropriate and very decent clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Perhaps the Minister did\r\n\r\nnot  quite  understand what I meant.

If a  teacher\r\n\r\nwears this type of dress, we can imagine the effect this\r\n\r\nwill  have  on his pupils. He has to set an example  and\r\n\r\nthen only will his pupils dress correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, some inconvenience may be caused to teachers in\r\n\r\nthis   respect,   but  they  must  fully   realise   the\r\n\r\nimplications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  living  in  a democratic society: they  must  behave\r\n\r\naccording to the circumstances.

However, the question  of  transport\r\n\r\nbursaries  has  never  arisen  in  connection  with  the\r\n\r\nprimary to secondary school postings of children.

But each and every case, as it arises,  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken into consideration for transport bursaries and, to\r\n\r\nthat extent, the allocation for transport bursaries  not\r\n\r\nonly in the main island but in the Southern Islands will\r\n\r\ntake into consideration every single case which comes to\r\n\r\nour attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Inche\r\n\r\nMohd.

From the facts I have  gathered,\r\n\r\nthis increase in $600,000 is still not enough.

I strongly feel that  our\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education should look into  this  matter.\r\n\r\nSince   the   Lembaga  Gerakan  Pelajaran   Dewasa   was\r\n\r\nconstituted in April 1960, adult education in the State\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  taken  on a new meaning and new purpose in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government's overall education policy.  While\r\n\r\nhelping   the  State  to  eradicate  illiteracy,   other\r\n\r\nactivities have been engaged in to link adult  education\r\n\r\nwith  the State's national aspirations, i.e. helping  to\r\n\r\nraise  the level of living so that all its citizens  can\r\n\r\nhave  a  better life. It is in this context  that  adult\r\n\r\neducation   has  come  to  be  regarded  as   continuing\r\n\r\neducation  to meet the urgent needs of adults  to  forge\r\n\r\nlinks between the multi-racial heritage of the past  and\r\n\r\nnew  knowledge, techniques and those of the present  and\r\n\r\nfuture.  However, it is noted that the  adult  education\r\n\r\nprogramme  of the Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran  Dewasa  has\r\n\r\nbeen  somewhat  limited by lack of funds. Perhaps,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  following  grants made by the Government  for  last\r\n\r\nyear  and this year will help to explain. In 1964,  only\r\n\r\n$900,000  was  provided  in  the  Estimates  for   Adult\r\n\r\nEducation.  In  the  course of the year,  it  took  much\r\n\r\nconvincing  to  get  a  further supplementary  grant  of\r\n\r\n$300,000 to help the Board meet its commitments for  the\r\n\r\nyear. Again for this year only $1.2 million was provided\r\n\r\nfor in the year's Estimates and further efforts have  to\r\n\r\nbe made to get a supplementary grant of $435,000 to meet\r\n\r\nall  the  financial commitments of the  Board  for  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Board applied for $2 million for\r\n\r\n1966 but only $1.8 million has been put down in the 1966\r\n\r\nEstimates.   It  is  apparent  that  the  Board's   past\r\n\r\nsubmissions  for  annual  grants  have  not  been  fully\r\n\r\naccepted,  despite  the fact that  for  1964  and  1965,\r\n\r\nGovernment had to provide later supplementary grants  to\r\n\r\nenable  the Board to meet its commitments for these  two\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would interest the House to note the yearly\r\n\r\nincreases  in  the number of persons attending  all  the\r\n\r\nBoard's classes and courses for the years 1961 to  1965.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the  House will bear with me  if  I  give  some\r\n\r\nfigures. The following figures speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On literacy and language classes -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin 1961 there were 11,749 students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  1962  it  was increased to 12,670. In 1963,  it  was\r\n\r\n20,491; in 1964, 27,353; and in 1965, 34,633.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the secondary evening classes, in 1961 there\r\n\r\nwere 4,394 students. In 1962, there were 5,712 students;\r\n\r\nin 1963, 6,934 students; in 1964, 9,854 students; and in\r\n\r\n1965, 10,826 students. In the other classes and courses,\r\n\r\nthat is, commercial, vocational, recreational, local and\r\n\r\nforeign  languages; in 1962, we had 7,357  students;  in\r\n\r\n1963,  there were 10,524 students; in 1964,  there  were\r\n\r\n14,858  students; and in 1965, 15,026 students.  So  you\r\n\r\ncan see, Sir, that every year there is a big increase in\r\n\r\nthe  student population in the classes conducted by  the\r\n\r\nEducation Board. In 1961 the two main activities of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  were literacy and language, and secondary evening\r\n\r\nclasses.  In  1962 it extended its activities  to  other\r\n\r\nfields. The increase in the number of persons the  Board\r\n\r\ncatered for was very marked last year and this year.  In\r\n\r\nthe  last  five years the Board has nearly  trebled  the\r\n\r\nenrolment  in its literacy and language classes.  It  is\r\n\r\nexpected  that  given more grants the  Board  can  still\r\n\r\nexpand  its  activities  in the other  fields  of  adult\r\n\r\neducation. Sir, I hope I have painted a clear picture of\r\n\r\nthe  activities  of  the  Adult Education  Board  and  I\r\n\r\nsincerely hope our Minister for Education will look into\r\n\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank the\r\n\r\nMember for Punggol for the very long compliment he  gave\r\n\r\nto   the  Ministry  of  Education  in  regard  to  adult\r\n\r\neducation  in  Singapore.  He  not  only  mentioned  the\r\n\r\nconsistent   increases  in  enrolment  in  the   various\r\n\r\nclasses,  language, literacy, secondary  and  the  other\r\n\r\nkinds   of  classes,  but  he  also  thought  that   the\r\n\r\nallocation was not enough and that it should  get  more.\r\n\r\nThose are very kind words indeed. It is a fact that  for\r\n\r\n1966  we  have asked for more; almost 40 per  cent  more\r\n\r\nthan  for 1965. The contribution to the Lembaga  Gerakan\r\n\r\nPelajaran  Dewasa is expended mainly on the  running  of\r\n\r\nlanguage,  literacy and secondary evening  classes.  The\r\n\r\nadministrative  cost, including personnel  -  emoluments\r\n\r\nfor the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermanent  staff - has remained  relatively  stable\r\n\r\nover  the past few years since the formation  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  in  1960.  The  demand  for  adult  education,\r\n\r\nhowever, has been increasing year by year, so much so\r\n\r\nthat  the annual provision in recent years has always\r\n\r\nhad  to  be supplemented. That fact alone shows  that\r\n\r\nfor  1966 we cannot go purely by previous figures and\r\n\r\nthat   should   there  be  any   need   for   further\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  then  supplementary provision  will  be\r\n\r\nsought for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already 10,000 students in 340 secondary\r\n\r\nclasses,  and the 1966 provision is for 355 secondary\r\n\r\nclasses - a further increase - with an estimated\r\n\r\nenrolment  of  12,000  students.  In  the  field   of\r\n\r\nliteracy  and language education, the 1966  provision\r\n\r\nis  for  355  literacy  and language  classes  up  to\r\n\r\nStandard 3 level for 33,000 students. Fifteen Primary\r\n\r\n6  classes catering for 450 students are also planned\r\n\r\nfor  1966.  The Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran  Dewasa  is\r\n\r\nalso conducting extra-mural courses to cater for  the\r\n\r\nvocational,  civic and recreational interest  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  all  of  which  are run  without  Government\r\n\r\nsubsidy. I do not know if the Member for Punggol  was\r\n\r\nthinking  of these classes. But if he was,  then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  as I said a minute ago, they are  being  run\r\n\r\nwithout   Government  subsidy,  despite   the  \r\n\r\never-expanding  activities  of these extra-mural  classes.\r\n\r\nEvery so often, Sir, you will hear of Japanese flower\r\n\r\narrangement   classes,  photography  classes,   motor\r\n\r\nmechanic  classes,  classes  on  radio  repair,   T.V\r\n\r\nrepair. They will probably soon go into other courses\r\n\r\non electronics. Besides that, the extra-mural section\r\n\r\nof  the  Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa also caters\r\n\r\nfor  the more intellectual type of courses with which\r\n\r\nyou  are familiar, Sir, like Hindu philosophy,  Islam\r\n\r\nand so on, given by very prominent people well versed\r\n\r\nin these subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

And will\r\n\r\nthe Minister expedite this application?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in regard to the\r\n\r\ncomplaint  raised  by  the Member for  Anson  about  the\r\n\r\nslowness  in giving grant-in-aid to schools -  I  presume\r\n\r\nhe  means  new schools - I do not think there has  been\r\n\r\nsuch  a  complaint  for  a long  time,  except  for  new\r\n\r\nschools.  As for the new schools, there are a number  of\r\n\r\nproblems  which arise, and quite often the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation alone is not responsible. There are the health\r\n\r\nand   other   requirements  with  which   the   Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment, the Chief Building Surveyor's Department and\r\n\r\na  host  of  other  departments are connected,  and  the\r\n\r\nproblems  are  finally issued to the  School  Management\r\n\r\nCommittee  before  the  Ministry of  Education  actually\r\n\r\ndishes out the grant-in-aid. As far as possible, we have\r\n\r\nmanaged to get things done, and I can assure the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  that there have not been many complaints  of\r\n\r\nsuch type of cases. If he can bring to our attention any\r\n\r\nparticular  case of grant-in-aid coming too slowly,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education will take it up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the remark made by the Member for\r\n\r\nAljunied  regarding a particular school, I  am  able  to\r\n\r\nanswer  in specific terms. He mentioned Yun Fong School.\r\n\r\nIt is a Government-aided school and, therefore, receives\r\n\r\ngrant-in-aid to enable it to pay the staff  as  well  as\r\n\r\nfor  the  cost of administration of the school. I  think\r\n\r\nwhat  he  wants  to  know  comes under  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  -     Head D 03 Subhead 004. I  shall  however\r\n\r\nanswer  the question though it is a little out of  place\r\n\r\nat  this  time. Yun Fong School in Potong Pasir  applied\r\n\r\nfor  a 1965 Capital Grant on the 25th of November, 1964,\r\n\r\nin respect of furniture and equipment under that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhead  - 200 sets of pupils' desks and chairs at $20  per\r\n\r\nset, costing a total of $4,000. It also applied, at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, for a grant for minor works to cover repairs,\r\n\r\ncolour wash to the school building, painting, altogether\r\n\r\ncosting $1,000. Incidentally, Yun Fong School is  not  a\r\n\r\nnew Government aided school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the first application for furniture and\r\n\r\nequipment, the Ministry has already processed it  and  a\r\n\r\ndecision will be given soon. It must be pointed out that\r\n\r\nreplacement  of furniture of old schools should  not  be\r\n\r\nundertaken  all  at once, but should be done  in  stages\r\n\r\nover  a  period of time, in order to enable the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  provide funds for other schools as well, whose needs\r\n\r\nare  equally as urgent as Yun Fong's if not more  so  in\r\n\r\nsome cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the second application which is for\r\n\r\nminor  works,  the Ministry does not as a  rule  approve\r\n\r\ngrants of projects which have already been initiated  or\r\n\r\ncompleted. It is, therefore, unlikely that consideration\r\n\r\nwill be given to this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

From  this  we  can see how much  importance  the\r\n\r\nGovernment attaches to higher education. I would like to\r\n\r\nmention   one   thing   in  passing,   namely,   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  When  it was first initiated,  it  received\r\n\r\ndonations from members of the public. Now I want to talk\r\n\r\nabout the problems relating thereto. Ten years ago  when\r\n\r\nNanyang  University was about to be  set  up,  different\r\n\r\nclasses   of  the  people,  including  trishaw   riders,\r\n\r\nmerchants,  traders, workers, all responded  keenly  and\r\n\r\ndonated  generously  to  the  Nanyang  University  Fund,\r\n\r\namounting to tens of millions of dollars, but  10  years\r\n\r\nhence  - today - we find that about $6.13 million  of\r\n\r\nsuch  donations  has not been received  by  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  authorities. I would like to mention  a  few\r\n\r\npoints in regard to this sum. For instance, Mr Tan Lark\r\n\r\nSye  was  one  of  the sponsors or founders  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  and  he was the Chairman of  the  Board  of\r\n\r\nDirectors  of Nanyang University until 1963. He  donated\r\n\r\n$5  million. From 1954 to 1959 he paid $2.5 million.  He\r\n\r\nis  still in debt to the Nanyang authorities to the tune\r\n\r\nof  $2.5  million.  The  Nanyang Siang  Pao  donated  $1\r\n\r\nmillion, but it has paid only $99,662.50 and is still in\r\n\r\ndebt  to  the tune of $900,337. Another example is  Shaw\r\n\r\nBrothers  Co. Ltd. They donated $250,000, but  they  are\r\n\r\nstill in debt to the amount of $0.2 million. It has only\r\n\r\npaid  $50,000. So from these examples, you can see  that\r\n\r\nsuch  people  have won general acclaim  from  all  sides\r\n\r\nthrough   the  newspapers  because  their   names   were\r\n\r\npublicised. But up till now, in the course of 10  years,\r\n\r\nlarge  sums from them are still not yet paid. There  are\r\n\r\nother  minor  examples I would not like to enumerate.  I\r\n\r\nonly  hope that the Ministry of Education can  urge  the\r\n\r\npresent Nanyang University Council quickly to claim such\r\n\r\noutstanding donations from these people and collect the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsums quickly so as to satisfy the general members of the\r\n\r\npublic.  At the same time, Nanyang University is  almost\r\n\r\nbankrupt. If such sums can be collected, then I  believe\r\n\r\nit   will  he  a  great  help  to  Nanyang  University's\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the Member for Anson has  mentioned  the\r\n\r\nrevision  of  school fees just now. I think  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  me  to  go into  the  reasons  for  this\r\n\r\nrevision of school fees for non-citizens. I have already\r\n\r\nexplained  this  in great detail when  I  spoke  on  the\r\n\r\nmotion  thanking  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  for  his\r\n\r\nSpeech.  The revision of school fees really only applies\r\n\r\nto  non-citizens; in other words, children who were  not\r\n\r\nborn  in  Singapore, or whose parents were not Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens. So all the other cases will not be affected by\r\n\r\nthis ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the contributions promised by certain members\r\n\r\nof  the  public  towards  the establishment  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  I think legally I would say the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  no  power  to  compel them to  contribute  if  they\r\n\r\nrefuse.  At best what the Government can do is to  exert\r\n\r\nsome  moral pressure, but beyond that I do not see  what\r\n\r\nwe  can do. But, of course, I agree completely with  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the  Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment that these well-wishers who have already got\r\n\r\nall  the  publicity  they  received  should  keep  their\r\n\r\npromises.
