Sir, when you\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwant  to  communicate with the masses, the commonest way, as you  know,  at  the\r\n\r\nprescnt moment, is by way of the newspapers, the radio and Rediffusion.  So  far\r\n\r\nas  we  know,  orders have been given to newspapers that at least two-thirds  of\r\n\r\nnewspaper  space be given to Government Benches and only one-third of  newspaper\r\n\r\nspace  be  given  to Opposition Benches. Since we have been limited  under  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, Sir, we will have to depend on other means of communication  with\r\n\r\nthe  public,  and  one of these very important means is by the  use  of  posers,\r\n\r\nplacards and banners. The use of posters, placards and banners can be seen  this\r\n\r\nway,  Sir. When you have a mass rally or a referendum meeting, you speak to  the\r\n\r\nparsons  who can come to listen to you. There are many persons in Singapore  who\r\n\r\nmay not be able to attend rallies because the time is not suitable, because they\r\n\r\nmay  have  to  do work or because of the distance between their  homes  and  the\r\n\r\nplaces  at  which rallies are held. Under those circumstances,  the  only  other\r\n\r\nmeans  left for us to communicate with the masses would be by means of  posters,\r\n\r\nbanners  and  placards. On the banners, on the placards and on  the  posters  we\r\n\r\nshall  be  able to tell the people what we may not be able to tell them directly\r\n\r\nby  word  of mouth. It is imperative that this be allowed in order that  we  may\r\n\r\nreally  and  truly communicate with the masses and let them know what  we  would\r\n\r\nlike them to know.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has already explained that canvassing would\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  as  in  general elections and when I asked him last  night  whether\r\n\r\nrallies  would be allowed in parks, playgrounds and other places which  are  now\r\n\r\nprohibited,  he  said,  \"Yes.\"  In other words,  places  like  Hong  Lim  Green,\r\n\r\nFullerton  Square and other parks and playgrounds will be available to political\r\n\r\nParties  for  the holding of rallies when canvassing starts for the  referendum.\r\n\r\nSir,  all  these  localities are available to political Parties at  least  three\r\n\r\nmonths  before the date of a general election. Today we know that the referendum\r\n\r\nwill  probably  be  held  either at the end of July or early  August.  There  is\r\n\r\nalready a guillotine on\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nour  debate  in order that the Prime Minister may sell the rights  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ndown  the  river on time. Therefore, if we were to ask for the use of  Fullerton\r\n\r\nSquare  and Hong Lim Green at this moment, the Government should have no  reason\r\n\r\nto  reject  our  applications for the use of these places. Yet,  we  have  their\r\n\r\ncurious official explanation as to why they have disallowed three public rallies\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been requested for by the Council of Joint Action.  Concerning  the\r\n\r\napplication for the use of Dhoby Ghaut, they say that the details have not  been\r\n\r\nsent  in; so they cannot give the answer. As regards the application for a rally\r\n\r\nin  Colombo  Court, they say that it is too near the precincts of the  Assembly.\r\n\r\nThen as regards the application to hold a rally at Fullerton Square, I will read\r\n\r\nthe  explanation given by the Government, Sir, It is in the Malay Mail of today,\r\n\r\ncol. 7:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Government statement explained that application for Fullerton Square\r\n\r\nrally  was refused because meetings there during office hours were allowed  only\r\n\r\nduring election time.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is already referendum time. Election time means three months before\r\n\r\nthe date of the general election. If the Ministers are sincere in their granting\r\n\r\nof  canvassing  as  in  a  general election, then  they  have  no  justification\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  for  refusing us the use of Fullerton Square at the present  moment,\r\n\r\nunless  they  want  to give us a promise that the referendum will  not  be  held\r\n\r\nwithin the next three months.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> On a point of information.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ngive way.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I thought I heard the Member saying that an election\r\n\r\ncampaign starts three months before polling day.

But then, Sir, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, being the Prime Minister, can do anything that he likes. He gazetted a\r\n\r\nnotice  saying  that Fullerton Square was allowed because it was on  a  national\r\n\r\nissue,  or because the P.A.P. wanted to explain more things to the people.  That\r\n\r\nwas  exactly how it was done.

I have already remarked right through the course of this\r\n\r\ndebate  that  there  has  been a great deal of repetition,  and  repetition,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  eats  into time. I think the Member for Queenstown was very  vociferous\r\n\r\nwhen  there  was  the debate on the guillotine motion. I would suggest  that  if\r\n\r\nthere  has  not been and will not be any repetition.

I would first point out that we have had no indication\r\n\r\nwhy  it is necessary to have this provision preventing these five articles  from\r\n\r\nbeing utilised during the period of propaganda. That is one. Two: I have pointed\r\n\r\nout,  Sir, that having, say, this placard showing the sign of the Workers' Party\r\n\r\noutside  our headquarters is political propaganda, although it is not  referable\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  referendum. It is unfortunate that they have not sought to  substitute  the\r\n\r\nword \"referendum\" for \"political\" here because it would make criminal those whom\r\n\r\nthey  have no intention, I am satisfied, to attack. Now, Sir, further than that,\r\n\r\nI  would also ask you to notice this: the amendment under this clause refers  to\r\n\r\nfive articles: (1) a symbol; (2) a set of colours; (3) a flag; (4) a banner; and\r\n\r\n(5)  a  placard.  Now,  Mr Speaker, if you will look  at  the  next  amendment,\r\n\r\namendment (ii) to clause 41, it seeks to leave out the same.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M.

Do the Government distinguish between placard\r\n\r\nand poster, or do they say that those two mean the same thing?

There,  he  talks  of\r\n\r\nanybody  carrying or displaying a poster, not a placard. If you carry a  placard\r\n\r\nand  you  merely exhibit a poster, surely he has used the wrong term  there.

I have committed a criminal offence,  because  I\r\n\r\nhave  visited an elector. There is no doubt, Sir, that the adults  in  the  Cold\r\n\r\nStorage  Creameries are Singapore citizens who are electors, and I have visited\r\n\r\nthem at their place of work, that is, the Singapore Cold Storage Creameries, for\r\n\r\na  purpose in connection with a referendum in that I am supplying refreshment to\r\n\r\na  person who is being engaged in referendum work.

The\r\n\r\noffences  that  it  is  sought to unearth are not of that  gravity  which  would\r\n\r\nnormally  require the utilisation of power of search. If you will  notice,  Sir,\r\n\r\nSection  73A of the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance to  which\r\n\r\nthe  Minister referred me, there is no power to go in and search. The only power\r\n\r\nis  to  arrest  if the offence is committed in the view of a police  officer - not\r\n\r\neven otherwise.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not like these additional powers.

The\r\n\r\naddition of such a sub-clause goes to show that the Government intend to use it\r\n\r\nto  deal  a blow at the people who do not support them and also against  Members\r\n\r\nsitting  on  this side of the House. The police officers should be  employed  in\r\n\r\nother  fields. They should use their power in a more useful way. The  Government\r\n\r\nshould make use of policemen on criminal offences, such as thefts and robberies.\r\n\r\netc. It is not right to give the police such powers as are embodied here because\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. and their supporters may suppress our supporters with the  help  of\r\n\r\npolice  officers. For instance, police officers can always resort to the powers\r\n\r\ngiven  under  sub-clause (3) to enter any home or place of work to  disturb  our\r\n\r\nsupporters and cause trouble to us by searching for documents, papers, and other\r\n\r\nthings  in our premises. We know this from experience when we found it necessary\r\n\r\nto  carry  out publicity work to educate the people. If the Government  want  to\r\n\r\nsuppress  and persecute any of our members, they will find it easy to resort  to\r\n\r\nthe powers provided in this sub-clause.

With this new sub-clause, it means if the police go into  premises  to\r\n\r\nsearch  and  if nothing incriminating is found, then the people whom the  police\r\n\r\nhave  searched  will  be asked to prove that they have not done  anything  wrong\r\n\r\nalthough  they  have not committed any offence. Now this is very ridiculous  and\r\n\r\nabsurd. This National Referendum Bill is infringing on and destroying the  basic\r\n\r\nrights  of  our  citizens. This sub-clause proposed by  the  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs will even infringe on the normal freedom of our citizens in their  daily\r\n\r\nactivities. If the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

Now, can we say that these women have committed  an  offence?\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  say  the  whole National Referendum  Bill  is  absurd.

May  I, Sir, draw your attention to the existing clause 43  (3)?  What\r\n\r\nwill  happen to a lady with her shopping basket who goes first to Lim  Koon  Ann\r\n\r\nand then goes to Prince's Flower Shop? She has been found in two \"places of work\r\n\r\nof electors in the same polling district\" - places which are other than her home\r\n\r\nor her place of work. What happens to her, Sir? Let me read sub-clause (3):\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any police officer [an officer includes a constable] may arrest without\r\n\r\nwarrant  any person offending in his view against any of the Provisions of  this\r\n\r\nsection  and take him before Magistrate's Court to be dealt with according  to\r\n\r\nlaw.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the lady can be forthwith arrested and she will be taken to the police\r\n\r\nstation.

The very spirit of the Bill is perfidious. But I do want to say this, and I do not think I am\r\n\r\nexaggerating. To make everybody in Singapore a presumptive criminal is even more\r\n\r\nperfidious than the clause which says that all negative votes shall be deemed to\r\n\r\nbe positive. Sir, this sub-clause that takes it as a matter of course that every\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen  by definition is a criminal is the most perfidious  thing  I\r\n\r\nhave  seen. Sir, you will forgive me if I take up the time of this House to call\r\n\r\nfor a division in respect of this clause.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, according to\r\n\r\nthe  general  law  existing in Singapore, for example, if the  police  arrest  a\r\n\r\nperson  who  is  suspected of robbery, they have to produce enough  evidence  to\r\n\r\nprove  his crime in Court. Only if there is ample evidence to prove his criminal\r\n\r\nactivity  can  he  be deemed a criminal and be convicted. But according  to  the\r\n\r\nwords in this sub-clause \"unless he proves the contrary\", a person seen entering\r\n\r\nmore  than  two  houses or places of work will have to prove  that  he  has  not\r\n\r\ncommitted an offence. This sub-clause is contrary to the general law prevailing in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry.  It  also  goes to prove that the police are incompetent  because  they\r\n\r\ncannot produce ample evidence and they have to ask the suspected person to prove\r\n\r\nhis  innocence,  it  looks  as if the Government are  going  to  deal  with  its\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents  in  an  unfair manner by using  this  provision.  If  this\r\n\r\nprovision  is  passed, there may be an atmosphere of fear on  polling  day,  and\r\n\r\nelectors will be forced to cast their votes in an atmosphere of fear on  polling\r\n\r\nday. When an elector goes to cast his vote, he cannot enter more than two houses\r\n\r\nto talk to the people living in them on polling day. On that day, if a person on\r\n\r\nhis  way  to  the  polling  station enters a coffee shop  to  buy  a  packet  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes, and at the same time has a chit-chat with the shopkeeper, and  after\r\n\r\nthat  because he forgets to buy a box of matches, he enters a grocer's  shop  to\r\n\r\nbuy  it and if at the same time he talks to the shop, keeper, then by virtue  of\r\n\r\nthis  provision, he can be deemed as having committed an offence because he  has\r\n\r\nentered more than two shophouses and talked to the different shopkeepers. He can\r\n\r\nbe accused of canvassing and therefore the police can arrest him. But the police\r\n\r\ncannot  produce  ample  evidence, and, therefore, he is required  to  prove  his\r\n\r\ninnocence. This provision is very unfair and infringes upon the individual  freedom of the citizens.

If\r\n\r\nyour  memory  is  good,  you  will remember that the Assembly  has  amended  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  a \"police officer\". From what I know, before the definition  was\r\n\r\namended, a \"police officer\" meant a police inspector or the Police Commissioner.\r\n\r\nBut  with  the  amendment, the P.A.P. has amended the  definition  to  mean  any\r\n\r\npoliceman. Therefore, applying that definition to this clause, we see  that  any\r\n\r\npoliceman, irrespective of his political affiliations, will have the  power  to\r\n\r\narrest anybody who commits an offence under this clause.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to procedure in the judiciary, if a person commits\r\n\r\nan  offence it is up to the police to charge the offender in court, that  is  to\r\n\r\nsay, the police must bring up the charge against the offender in court, and also\r\n\r\nto produce evidence. And in prosecuting, the police must at least be represented\r\n\r\nby a police officer who must produce the evidence to prove his charge. But under\r\n\r\nthis  clause the Government is going against common judiciary procedure.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot the accuser who has to produce the evidence but the accused who has to prove\r\n\r\nhis innocence.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has every day been crying out in defence of legal\r\n\r\nprocedure,  but  at  the  same time, as we can see from this  clause,  they  are\r\n\r\ndisrupting  the  rule  of  law.  This procedure for  prosecution  is  completely\r\n\r\nunacceptable  to  us.  It  is  also an infringement  on  personal  freedom.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, a teacher finds that his student has committed a dishonest act  in  an\r\n\r\nexamination. Now, he must produce evidence before he can punish the student. And\r\n\r\naccording to the definition laid down by Government, the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nstudent  must  himself produce evidence to show that he has not  committed  this\r\n\r\ndishonest act.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this kind of provision of the law can only be made by the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  which has no serious regard for the law. According  to  this\r\n\r\namendment,  of which we are very much afraid, during the poll on the referendum,\r\n\r\nthe  Government allows only the Superintendent to supervise the proceedings. But\r\n\r\nevery  Opposition Party has its offices, and there will be a lot of  workers  in\r\n\r\neach  of  these  offices. Those workers may be transferred from  one  office  to\r\n\r\nanother. Accordingly the Opposition workers will be prosecuted by the provisions\r\n\r\nof  this  clause, unless they can prove that they have not been  canvassing  and\r\n\r\nhave not infringed any of the clauses in the Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clear that in a referendum, unlike in a general election, there are no candidates, and the Government will do all the work of the\r\n\r\nreferendum.  Since it is like this there is no necessity for  the  inclusion  of\r\n\r\nthis clause. Therefore, we can see very clearly the motive of the Government and\r\n\r\nthe plot behind it in bringing out this clause. The Government are making use of\r\n\r\nthis  clause to deal with their political opponents, that is, those who  do  not\r\n\r\nagree  with the P.A.P. The Government will be able to use this clause  for  this\r\n\r\ntype of suppressive act.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the reply of the Minister for Home Affairs was to\r\n\r\nthe  effect  that  according to past experience in the elections,  there  was  a\r\n\r\nnecessity for adding this clause. He also pointed out that in the Hong  Lim  by-election  certain  things  took place which make the inclusion  of  this  clause\r\n\r\nnecessary. Mr Speaker, Sir, are the P.A.P. Government adding this clause  after\r\n\r\ntheir  experience in the Hong Lim by-election? I can see it is not like this  at\r\n\r\nall, if the explanation of the Minister for Home Affairs is well founded on  the\r\n\r\nHong Lim by-election, such incidents took place.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs should have amended the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance before the Anson by-election and added this clause\r\n\r\n82\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto that Ordinance. The addition of this clause is not for the purpose of preventing  other  political Parties from canvassing on polling day or influencing  the\r\n\r\nvoters  in their decision on the referendum, but the Government's real intention\r\n\r\nis  to  take  action, through this clause, to deal with those  people  whom  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. do not like.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home Affairs has pleaded that we should give powers  which  would\r\n\r\nprovide  effective  enforcement of the provision against canvassing  on  polling\r\n\r\nday.  Let  us see how this clause will work if it is passed. Imagine  me  for  a\r\n\r\nmoment,  Sir, to  be one of those deep-dyed cleverly trained subversive  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncadres. I am trained to go on polling day with contempt for the law in order  to\r\n\r\ncanvass house-to-house for the P.A.P. point of view. I go into one house  and  I\r\n\r\nsay,  \"If you do not vote for this referendum, you know what the Government will\r\n\r\ndo?\"  I come out and I go into another house, and then let us assume that  there\r\n\r\nis a policeman with courage enough to arrest the known P.A.P. canvasser and I am\r\n\r\narrested.  It  is  Saturday afternoon. I am taken to the police  station.  I  am\r\n\r\ngranted bail. I come back on Monday morning to the Magistrate's Court. A date is\r\n\r\nfixed  for trial and in about two months I am tried. The evidence is given  that\r\n\r\nthe  police constable watched me as I went into house A, remained there for some\r\n\r\ntime, and I went into house B and I went into house C. Now, Sir, that is all the\r\n\r\nevidence.  If  that  is  all the evidence, it means that  the  persons  who  are\r\n\r\nresident in houses A, B and C or shops are not prepared to give evidence against\r\n\r\nme.  Otherwise  there will be no need of a presumption and those  witnesses  can\r\n\r\ncome  forward and say, \"This man came to our house and tried to canvass for this\r\n\r\nreferendum.\" There would be no need for this clause. So it is when  we  envisage\r\n\r\nthe  possibility  that  if  no  witnesses  are  forth, coming  to  support  the\r\n\r\nprosecution's case, it means that those witnesses will be coming to support  the\r\n\r\ndefence  case  and  the defence case will be, \"Oh yes, I went  to  house  A  and\r\n\r\ninquired after his daughter's health; I went into house B in order\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto  have  a drink with an old friend of mine, and I went to house C in order  to\r\n\r\nplay  mahjong.\" And I call these people and they all say that it is true.  Where\r\n\r\nis  the effectiveness of this clause? Quite seriously, the Minister, I see,  was\r\n\r\nearnest,  and  in  his  earnestness he stumbled upon  a  horrible  provision,  a\r\n\r\nprovision  which  says that everybody shall be deemed to  be  guilty  unless  he\r\n\r\nproves  himself innocent. Even then, Sir, does it provide an effective means  of\r\n\r\nenforcing  this clause? The truth is it does not. Unless you can  get  evidence\r\n\r\nfrom the persons who are approached by the canvassers, no amount of presumptions\r\n\r\nare  going  to be of any weight. The Minister says that not a single person  has\r\n\r\nbeen  apprehended  in the years past for this offence of canvassing  on  polling\r\n\r\nday.  Surely  the Minister recognises that there can be two or more  answers  to\r\n\r\nthat.  First,  no such offence was committed. He says he knows  the  P.A.P. had\r\n\r\ncommitted it. All right. I will accept his word for that. Second, if the offence\r\n\r\nwas committed, the police did not notice it. Third, if the police did notice it,\r\n\r\nthey  were  afraid to arrest the P.A.P. Now, Sir, a presumption is necessary  in\r\n\r\norder  to  bring home a conviction to a person already apprehended, it does  not\r\n\r\nhelp  you  to  apprehend  him. The Minister tells us that  no  person  has  been\r\n\r\napprehended for this offence.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law has made an extraordinary statement, considering that he is the Minister for Law, Sir. He says that this is in the tradition of presumptions of guilt which are to be found peppered in our law. I say to you with respect, Sir, I question that statement. There are presumptions of various kinds\r\n\r\nbut  never  a presumption of guilt of this character in respect of circumstances\r\n\r\nwhich  are wholly consistent with innocence. Sir, can there be any circumstances\r\n\r\nmore  consistent with innocence that you should in a twenty-four day - let us make\r\n\r\nit  a  twelve-hour day in order not to exaggerate - in a twelve-hour day that  you\r\n\r\nshould visit more than two homes or places of work in one polling district?  Can\r\n\r\nyou  imagine  anything more consistent with innocence than that?  Where  is  the\r\n\r\nindication  of  guilt in the conduct of that character? Where in all  the  laws,\r\n\r\nwhether democratic or not, can the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister find me\r\n\r\na  presumption  which  makes all human beings in the  normal  pursuit  of  their\r\n\r\nordinary  activities,  criminals in the eyes  of  the  law,  unless  they  prove\r\n\r\nthemselves innocent? This is a horrible provision, Sir, I could see the value of\r\n\r\nclause  29  to them. I am not going into it. But I could understand  the  Machiavellian  plan  behind it whereby the Government had to have  it  for  their  own\r\n\r\nnefarious purpose. All right. They went through it with cold-blooded calculating\r\n\r\ndishonesty.  They  need it. But this one is not necessary for their  plan.  This\r\n\r\nclause  is  not necessary for a Machiavellian purpose. This clause is  merely  a\r\n\r\ngratuitous  exhibition of inordinate sadism. This clause is totally unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThis  clause  merely proves in a manner beyond question the  incapacity  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to understand the elements not only of democracy but of the  concept\r\n\r\nof criminal law that is inherent in respect for the human being.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister speaks of conscience. Mr Speaker, I do not like to say this because the Minister may well in his private capacity be a man of complete\r\n\r\ndecency. I have no reason to think otherwise. But I do say to the Minister  that\r\n\r\nin  the context of the present debate, the word \"conscience\" comes ill from  his\r\n\r\nmouth.  I  say  this,  however necessary the other foul clauses  of  this  Bill,\r\n\r\nhowever  necessary we might think it was to make an exhibition of the  potential\r\n\r\nof  democracy for cold-blooded traitorous conduct towards their own people, this\r\n\r\nis not necessary. There is no sense in pursuing this clause.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (in Mandarin):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I find it necessary to add something to our reason for objecting to this sub-clause.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision for a presumption as embodied in this sub-clause will cause\r\n\r\ntrouble  to  the person who is presumed to have committed an offence under  this\r\n\r\nclause. Let us examine the person who is presumed to have committed the offence.\r\n\r\nLet  us  see  what is the nature of the offence a person would presumably  have\r\n\r\ncommitted. Does it mean that he\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhas  destroyed any State property? Has he infringed on the personal  liberty  of\r\n\r\nother  people?  Or has he attacked or done any harm or wounded anybody?  Has  he\r\n\r\nslandered the reputation of any other citizen? No. It is not so. And yet to  presume  that  such a person has committed an offence the presumption is only  that\r\n\r\nhe has tried to influence the thoughts of other electors! For instance, can  he\r\n\r\ninfluence anyone just by a chance meeting? The answer is no. That is impossible.\r\n\r\nWhen  an elector goes into a polling station at the time of voting, nobody would\r\n\r\nhe  able  to threaten or intimidate him. That is why I say this presumed offence\r\n\r\nis  in  fact groundless because this person has not done anything wrong. He  has\r\n\r\nnot  caused any damage to State property and has not infringed on the  right  of\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  any other citizen. Under such circumstances, why should the  Government  give  so much trouble to that person? The Government itself has  obviously\r\n\r\ndeprived the people of speech and freedom of expression by passing certain laws.\r\n\r\nWhy do the Government not provide some provision to make such an act an offence?\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  tell  this to the Ministers of the P.A.P.  The  people  will\r\n\r\nremember  who  have committed offences. The people will know how to  deal  with\r\n\r\nsuch people who have committed such offences against the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Mammen, I do not wish to play the same old record again\r\n\r\nand  again  like the Members of the Barisan Sosialis. I just want  to  be  brief\r\n\r\nabout  it.  The  purpose  of this amendment is to see that  the  prohibition  on\r\n\r\ncanvassing  on polling day would be effectively enforced. It is not  to  prevent\r\n\r\nlaw-abiding citizens from their normal pursuit of earning their living. That  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  purpose. The examples quoted by the Member for Punggol and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tampines are ridiculous. No sensible police officers will try to  interfere\r\n\r\n[Laughter].

If the true wishes of the people are to be ascertained, then\r\n\r\nthe  Government  must ensure that the referendum or the elections  are  properly\r\n\r\ncarried out. Knowing very well that the Communists and their stooges are  intent\r\n\r\non wrecking the referendum and thus trying to prevent merger and Malaysia taking\r\n\r\nplace,  it is not beyond their capacity, judging from past experience, to resort\r\n\r\nto  all forms of canvassing by means of intimidation to get the voters to do the\r\n\r\nthings which they want them to do.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, let us examine again why the leaders of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwant  to  provide such a sub-clause as this in the National Referendum Bill.  We\r\n\r\ncan  see very clearly from this provision that the Government has been and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  very undemocratic and very unreasonable in  carrying  but  the\r\n\r\nnational  referendum. We can further see, from this provision, the  Government's\r\n\r\nintention and its guilty conscience.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, the Government has this provision in the National Referendum Bill for the purpose of carrying out an undemocratic national referendum and to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  occasions when there may be certain incidents when the proceedings\r\n\r\nof  voting  cannot be continued, so that the Government may find scapegoats  for\r\n\r\nnot carrying out the national referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, you can see that this Bill is very unpopular, unconvincing and unacceptable to the people. We can also see that the leaders of the Party in\r\n\r\npower  are  very,  very  cunning,  and that their  usual  trick  is  to  set  up\r\n\r\ncommissions  of  inquiry. That is what they are most clever in  doing,  but  in\r\n\r\nfuture when their falsehoods and the true nature of the national referendum  are\r\n\r\ndisclosed  to  the people - when everybody can see through their acts - then  they\r\n\r\nmay set up again Commissions of Inquiry to cover up their\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nshameful acts with regard to the provisions in this Bill. Their acts are usually\r\n\r\nvery ugly, and these are facts which everybody can see.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, today the fact is that the Government are bent on forcing\r\n\r\nthrough  their White Paper merger proposals. They will resort to  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\ntactics  and methods, however mean, to achieve their purpose. Through  this  provision, they try to explain that they want to better their relations between the\r\n\r\npolice and the people, but in fact it is to the contrary.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that since the P.A.P. Government came to power, they have only\r\n\r\nbeen  pretending to do good things. Though they have been giving wide  publicity\r\n\r\nto  the  co-operation between the police and the people and co-operation between\r\n\r\nall  classes,  the fact is that their true colours have been revealed.  For  the\r\n\r\npurpose of forcing through their White Paper merger proposals, they even try  to\r\n\r\nmake use of police officers to achieve their purpose.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, in the past, the relationship between the police and the\r\n\r\npeople  was very bad. Indeed, we could all see that. The people were  not  happy\r\n\r\nabout how the police carried out the policies of the colonial government and the\r\n\r\nLint  Yew Hock Government. The P.A.P. Government was aware of this. After coming\r\n\r\nto  power the P.A.P. used to say that the people and the police should mix well,\r\n\r\nand  the people should regard police officers as public servants. But today  the\r\n\r\naddition of this provision in the National Referendum Bill is giving the  police\r\n\r\ngreat  powers. There is such a provision here and I believe that all responsible\r\n\r\npolicemen will feel that such powers given to them are really a burden, and they\r\n\r\ncan  realise that the addition of such a provision is for the purpose of  asking\r\n\r\nthem  to arrest more people during a national referendum, especially those  whom\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. do not like. In other words, if there is a policeman more  liked  by\r\n\r\nthe  P;A.P. or an officer liked by the P.A.P. and eager to get promotion, he can\r\n\r\nalways  arrest more people to please the P.A.P. From this we can  see  that  the\r\n\r\nplots and intrigues of the Government have been exposed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, in the system of parliamentary democracy, the people have\r\n\r\ndemocratic  rights. They elect their representatives in order to  improve  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood and to pass good laws to provide for good government. In deciding  on\r\n\r\nany  matter  of national importance, the Government should let the people  take\r\n\r\npart  in the decisions on such matters. The people will then be pleased if  they\r\n\r\nare given such a chance.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the matter before us is another chance for the Government to let the\r\n\r\npeople participate in deciding on matters of national importance, but the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment are trying to make use of the Bill for the purpose of achieving their\r\n\r\nown  ends  at  the  expense of the people, forcing them to  vote,  and  this  is\r\n\r\ncontrary  to the spirit of democracy. Everybody knows it very well, Mr  Mammen.\r\n\r\nFrom this provision, we can see that on the day when the people go to cast their\r\n\r\nvotes  to decide their destiny, it should be a happy day for them to cast sacred\r\n\r\nvotes.  But  what  should be so will, instead, become a day of  terror  for  the\r\n\r\npeople, as they will not have the occasion to be merry because polling day  will\r\n\r\nbe  like  a curfew day to them. The P.A.P. are only trying to use good names  to\r\n\r\ncover their shameful acts.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the P.A.P. used to accuse the Lim Yew Hock Government of showing\r\n\r\na  goat's head while selling dog's meat, but the P.A.P.

If we had counted we would have noted how  many  times\r\n\r\ndemocracy  has been mentioned and that any step taken by the Government  is  not\r\n\r\ndemocratic\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I should also like to explain more of this in my future speeches; but now\r\n\r\nI  would  just like to say this - they say that every law and procedure is anti-democracy,  because there is unity under that one law and one procedure.  \"Nothing\r\n\r\ncan be done as one likes; this is to limit liberty,\" they say, because there  is\r\n\r\none  law.  Thus they say that this Bill is to limit their liberty.  Up  to  this\r\n\r\ntime, they have been free and independent to rob; now because there is a law  to\r\n\r\nrestrict  that freedom, they cannot do what they like. For a thief to  say  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  restriction on their liberty is not democratic; so  also  for  the\r\n\r\ngangsters, the thieves and the robbers and so too for those who commit offences.\r\n\r\n\"There  is  no  democracy,\"  they  say, \"and the  purpose  of  this  law  is  to\r\n\r\nretaliate.\" But because of this same law the public are at liberty to move about\r\n\r\nand  to  liberate themselves from gangsters and evil-doers. Their peace in  life\r\n\r\nwill  not be interfered with because there is law and order. So the term  \"good\"\r\n\r\nor  \"bad\"  of any arrangement or law depends on the motive of the person  making\r\n\r\nuse  of the law. If the mind of the person is dirty, then the interpretation  is\r\n\r\nalso  dirty. But there are some Members of the Barisan Sosialis, not the people,\r\n\r\nwho  have to be forced to see that there are Members of this Assembly who cannot\r\n\r\nbe forced. They are the persons who bring letters to compel people! We have seen\r\n\r\nwhat  they  have done! Yet they protest against just anything, against  any  law\r\n\r\nwhich  gives  freedom  to the people to think and so on: they  say  this  is  an\r\n\r\narrangement which restricts freedom and is not democratic!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem before us is a national problem. It is a national matter. It is a\r\n\r\nthing  which  will decide our future and that of our children - a future  that  is\r\n\r\nfree  from  all suppression and evil influence - so that people can go  and  vote\r\n\r\naccording  to  their own feeling and conscience. I ask the Member for  Anson  to\r\n\r\nsay, if a person wants to buy meat here and fish there, or if a person goes to a\r\n\r\ntextile  store to buy cloth, whether all this is nonsense?

It all depends on the motive of the  person\r\n\r\nshaking  hands with the woman; and this can be proved. In the same way  too,  it\r\n\r\nall depends on the mind of the person who interprets this law.,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Prime Minister is rather delightful, but I think he will  agree\r\n\r\nwith  me  that it would be undemocratic to pass a law to say that everybody  who\r\n\r\nshakes  hands with a woman is to be presumed to do so lustfully and  criminally,\r\n\r\nunless he proves the contrary. Ha, ha, ha! He must agree that, Sir. And this  is\r\n\r\nwhat, in fact, this law is doing. You see, this law says that if a person enters\r\n\r\nmore than two places, whether a house or a place of work in the same polling district,  he  is  presumed to be a guilty person and he can  be  arrested.  It  is\r\n\r\npresuming  it  and  that is why I say language has no meaning  if  this  is  not\r\n\r\nundemocratic. I know he has his feelings and we should repeat it,  but  I  would\r\n\r\nask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister to recognise, for example,\r\n\r\nthat the Singapore National Union of Journalists - it is not a Communist body, it\r\n\r\nis  not  a Barisan body - but does he know that in their anxiety, they have  today\r\n\r\nissued a public statement in which with moderation and with dignity they protest\r\n\r\nagainst the undemocratic Referendum Bill, whereby they say the people are to  be\r\n\r\nbarred from expressing their free and frank will on constitutional propositions,\r\n\r\nand where they are appealing to us, Members of the Assembly, to allow the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore to express the right to express their views freely and frankly  on\r\n\r\nall constitutional issues?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I admire them for having had the courage to do this, since they are\r\n\r\nemployees  of  newspapers  whose proprietors with a healthy  eye  to  their  own\r\n\r\ncommercial  prosperity  have bowed their necks to the  yoke  of  Government  propaganda.  And  these men who have issued this appeal know that their  Committee\r\n\r\nmembers  would  henceforth be pinpointed and singled  out  for  attack  by  this\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and that they will thereby be deemed by their employers  to  be  an\r\n\r\nembarrassment and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmay - probably  will - find  them in a position where their public-spirited  courage\r\n\r\nwill mean personal sacrifice and discrimination in their careers.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister must bear with us. This is perhaps the occasion when we must refer to the basic concepts of democracy which\r\n\r\nare  in  essence  the  basic concepts of decent relations between  man  and  his\r\n\r\nfellowman. I think he will agree with me that apart from these issues,  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  unfair  in  our attitude towards the Government when  we  make  these\r\n\r\ncharges,  and  they come from various facets of the Opposition; they  come  even\r\n\r\nfrom  a  Member  who  was loyal to her Party until the day before  yesterday.  I\r\n\r\nreally  cannot understand the insistence on this clause. The Minister  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  it will help the police. He knows very well that it can do no such thing.\r\n\r\nIt  is not giving the police the right to arrest somebody whom they suspect;  it\r\n\r\nis  giving them the right to arrest anybody whom they want to. Can the  Minister\r\n\r\nseriously  tell me that on polling day he will not go to three different  places\r\n\r\nin  the  same  polling district? Can he really say that? Can any Member  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Benches tell me - tell this House - that on polling day he will  not  be\r\n\r\nseen in more than two places in the same polling district? Does not every Member\r\n\r\non  the Government Benches recognise that there are thousands of people whom  he\r\n\r\nrespects  who  are  close to him, who are honest, decent  people,  who  will  on\r\n\r\npolling day be going to more than two, places in the same polling district? Does\r\n\r\nhe  not recognise that those people are subject to immediate arrest? That is the\r\n\r\npoint at issue.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He would have us believe that society consists of only a few\r\n\r\ninnocent  people!  Mr Mammen, it is true that people do go shopping.  If  I  go\r\n\r\nshopping  to three different places on polling day, it does riot follow  that  I\r\n\r\nwill be arrested. What I say to the Barisan is that if they are found organising\r\n\r\ncanvassing  in a big way, it is this section of the law which will enable  their\r\n\r\nactivities to be detected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  which will enable some meaning to be given to the prohibition of canvassing\r\n\r\non  referendum  day.

The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth and Law eventually confessed that the purpose of this new provision is to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  Barisan  Sosilias  boys. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  as  a  responsible\r\n\r\nOpposition Party, we cannot allow the Government to make use of legal  machinery\r\n\r\nto deal with its opponents in an unfair way because we will have to face all the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. The object of any government legislation should be for  the\r\n\r\ninterest of all the people of Singapore, but the Minister for Health and Law has\r\n\r\nclearly said that the purpose of this provision is specifically to deal with the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis boys. We cannot allow the Government to abuse the provisions of\r\n\r\nthe law to protect their own interests.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister said that we\r\n\r\nwere  undemocratic. He said that if a thief is arrested, we cannot say  that  democracy is at fault. Now, what he meant was that the Barisan Sosialis is  an  undemocratic  Party  because  we are supposed to know  the  fact  very  well.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, this is common logic. Nobody denies that if a thief is arrested he\r\n\r\nshould  be tried by law. According to the law, if he is proved to have committed\r\n\r\nan offence, then he should be legally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npunished.  But if you just shout saying that certain people are thieves  without\r\n\r\nany concrete evidence, then you cannot be right. The P.A.P. Government have been\r\n\r\nshouting that we are not democratic; that is not right. Now, what is the  actual\r\n\r\nfact?  The fact is that the P.A.P. are the thieves because they want to  deprive\r\n\r\nthe  people  of their basic democratic rights in broad daylight. The  Government\r\n\r\nwant to resort to legislation and to all sorts of legal provisions to carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  undemocratic act under cover of democracy. In doing this, they are acting\r\n\r\ncontrary to the basic democratic rights of the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister said that the purpose of this additional sub-clause is to enable all good law-abiding citizens to be\r\n\r\nprotected to express their free choice and views. Mr Speaker, Sir, according to\r\n\r\nparagraphs  (a)  and (b) of sub-clause (1) of clause 43, we  can  see  that  all\r\n\r\ncitizens on polling day will not be able to carry out canvassing. When there  is\r\n\r\nsuch  a specific provision, how can there be any fear that canvassing will  take\r\n\r\nplace on polling day? Now, the logic of the Parliamentary Secretary is only  the\r\n\r\nlogic  of  the P.A.P., and it is not the kind of logic acceptable to the  common\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are most concerned that under this new provision, anybody\r\n\r\ncan  at any time be arrested by any police officer. The Minister for Health  and\r\n\r\nLaw  has  also  very clearly disclosed that the purpose of this  additional  provision is to deal with the Barisan Sosialis boys, and now we can see clearly the\r\n\r\ntrue  purpose of this new provision of the Government, which is to suppress  the\r\n\r\npeople  and political Parties which are working in the interests of the  people.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Anson and the United People's Party' representatives  here  have\r\n\r\nalso  expressed their views against this undemocratic provision.  I  am  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion  that if the Government want to forge through the passage  of  this  provision; it will only go to show that they are making a mockery of democracy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the words proposed to be added, be there added.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee divided: Ayes, 27; Noes, 17; Absent, 7; Abstentions, Nil.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n       Ayes.

In\r\n\r\nother  words,  Sir, if anyone should petition to a Judge and if  there  is  some\r\n\r\nsecret information against him placed at the disposal of the Referendum Judge by\r\n\r\nthe  Special Branch, or whatever branch the Ministers can think of, then he  can\r\n\r\nsay, \"Oh! this man is a Communist.

Our fear is this. If any written or other report is presented  to  the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Judge  and  treated as secret, and therefore not  available  to  the\r\n\r\ndefendant  or to the petitioner, then he will not be in a position to rebut  the\r\n\r\ncharge  made  against him. We want to stress once again, Sir, that justice  must\r\n\r\nnot  only be done but must be seen to be done.

It is the end of (a)?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is right. I am just referring to the material part. I do\r\n\r\nnot wish to take up unduly the time of the House. Mr Speaker, you will remember\r\n\r\nthat originally this Government in presenting this Bill made no provision at all\r\n\r\nfor  a referendum petition. They knew that they were going to extract a 100  per\r\n\r\ncent  return  through their own tortuous way and they wanted no referendum  petition. When this extraordinary lacuna was drawn to their attention and they recognised  that  it was indefensible, they brought in provisions, loaded ones,  Sir.\r\n\r\nNow,  Sir, I know of no similar provisions it the democratic world whereby  the\r\n\r\nState Advocate-General must, according to the Minister for Law, hand over to the\r\n\r\nReferendum Judge any memoranda he receives from the police or from Ministers or,\r\n\r\nno  doubt, from P.A.P. organisations. And those passages that are marked  secret\r\n\r\nwill  not  be disclosed to the petitioner, will not be disclosed to the  public,\r\n\r\nand  the  Judge  is  required to take them into consideration.  Sir,  first  and\r\n\r\nforemost,  let us ask ourselves whether it is fair to the Judge, with his  sense\r\n\r\nof  integrity, to compel him by law to act in this dishonest fashion. For it  is\r\n\r\ndishonest  to  take  into consideration a statement not  on  oath,  prepared  in\r\n\r\nsecret, compiled from sources unknown, not subjected to cross-examination and in\r\n\r\nrespect of which the persons accused cannot make a defence because they  do  not\r\n\r\neven know the accusation. I say to you, Sir, that this is grossly unfair to  our\r\n\r\nJudges, to seek of them P.A.P. conduct. You know, Mr Speaker, that if you  make\r\n\r\na law that a defendant shall not know what the plaintiff says, he shall not know\r\n\r\nwhat  the  plaintiff  claims,  he  may not cross-examine  the  plaintiff,  every\r\n\r\nplaintiff would necessarily win his case because it is only the power to  cross-examine\r\n\r\nhim, the power to give contrary evidence which helps to bring out the truth  and\r\n\r\noften to rebut a claim which, on the face of it, may seem legitimate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if there was a law, as this law, whereby I could go to court and say you borrowed $1,000 from me\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbut  you  are not allowed to hear what I said, the Judge is not allowed to  tell\r\n\r\nyou what I said to him, and I said to him, \"This is your signature agreeing that\r\n\r\nyou  borrowed $1,000 from me\" and you are not allowed to cross-examine  me;  you\r\n\r\nare  not even allowed to know what I said. What can the Judge do but give  me  a\r\n\r\njudgment  against you for $1,000? You will appreciate that the Referendum  Judge\r\n\r\nhas the power to send to prison and to disfranchise citizens and Assemblymen.  I\r\n\r\nask  you,  Sir,  in what possible circumstances can there be the  need  for  the\r\n\r\nsecrecy reminiscent of the Star Chamber?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would enquire, are there other countries in the world where there are Communists? I would enquire, are there democracies honestly seeking to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  forces of subversion and seeking a healthy development of  the  human\r\n\r\npersonality  and  human society? And I would ask in the  context  of  the  reply\r\n\r\nwhether  this  Government knows of any country in the  world  with  a  provision\r\n\r\nsimilar to this, if they want a loaded verdict, put in the clause in respect  of\r\n\r\nevery referendum petition, the Referendum Judge shall make such findings as  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs directs. Can he not recognise, Mr Speaker, that  one\r\n\r\nday,  maybe, given the opportunity, the Barisan would seek to play  on  him  the\r\n\r\nsame foul tricks that he is playing on the people of Singapore? I know they  are\r\n\r\nmaking  certain  that these provisions will not apply to them.  Because  of  the\r\n\r\nextent of filth which is beginning to seep through the consciousness of all  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, the Government recognises that it cannot cannot keep  this\r\n\r\nBill  on  the  statute  book for its own health. But I  ask,  wherein  lies  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  for this additional perfidy? What is it conceived for?  What  set  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances  would require our Judges to be made the tools  of  darkness,  the\r\n\r\ninstruments  of  P.A.P. dishonesty,  who are  compelled  to  give  judgment  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the  reports received from the Special  Branch  and  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs? Even if those reports are honestly compiled, does the\r\n\r\nMinister not recognise the possible\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndubious  character of the sources from which such reports are compiled? He  will\r\n\r\ntell  you,  Sir, it is in the discretion of the Judge to reject the  memorandum.\r\n\r\nWhat  discretion has the poor Judge when he cannot even ask whether this is true\r\n\r\nof the petitioner, because that which is marked \"Secret\" may not be communicated\r\n\r\nto anybody else? What discretion is there? He may not hear the defendant. He may\r\n\r\nnot  tell  the  defendant what the accusation is, but you say that  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndiscretion whether he accepts the plaintiff's case or no. On what basis?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a long list of classic perfidious provisions, let us add one more\r\n\r\nexample  of  a  government that has not the slightest clue or  understanding  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  or  respect for the people; a government that would  have  been  more\r\n\r\nappropriate in the time of Hitler and in his country.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nsaid  before  that there is very little coordination between the  brain  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson and his tongue -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Cannot you say something new?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> - but today I found that there is no proper co-ordination between\r\n\r\nhis  eyes  and his mouth, Sir. He has not looked at these clauses very carefully\r\n\r\nas  we have done. I see nothing objectionable in the sub-clause. The Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  has said that this sub-clause is objectionable because it will allow  the\r\n\r\nplaintiff's case to be put without the defendant knowing what it is,  and  being\r\n\r\ngiven an opportunity to cross-examine and the court therefore can be bamboozled.\r\n\r\nThat is what he said before the Select Committee, Sir. What is the purpose of  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  petition? It invites a judicial determination  whether  or  not  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of the referendum or part of it held in any electoral division or polling\r\n\r\ndistrict should be held to be void because of general bribery, general treating,\r\n\r\ngeneral  intimidation and other forms of misconduct which may have prevented  or\r\n\r\nmisled  or confused a voter in recording his vote at the referendum; or  because\r\n\r\nof non-compliance with the provisions of the Bill where it can be\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nshown  that such non-compliance materially affected the result of the  whole  of\r\n\r\nthe returns or the return of any electoral division or polling district. That is\r\n\r\nthe purpose of a referendum petition.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 52 (5), to which he has taken objection, would be necessary and useful\r\n\r\nto  inform the Referendum Judge of what has taken place. This information  would\r\n\r\nreach  the  Referendum Judge through the State Advocate-General, and  only  such\r\n\r\ninformation as is classified to be secret cannot be disclosed. The  rest  of  it\r\n\r\ncan  be disclosed. This protection of secrecy is obviously in the protection  of\r\n\r\nwitnesses.  This  sub-clause itself provides that the Judge can  only  use  this\r\n\r\ninformation when determining upon a referendum petition. It is so stated in sub-clause (5).\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the petitioners in a referendum petition can only be the Superintendent\r\n\r\nor  a  person  who  has voted or has the right to vote at the referendum.  In  a\r\n\r\nreferendum petition there are no accused persons and there is no danger of  this\r\n\r\nsecret information, which is made available to the Judge, being used to the  prejudice of any individual person in the way the Member for Anson has suggested.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to making a determination on the merits of the referendum\r\n\r\npetition itself when such secret information can be seen by the Judge, the Judge\r\n\r\ncan  also  at the conclusion of the trial of the referendum petition report  the\r\n\r\nnames  of  all  those  who have been concerned in illegal and corrupt  practices.\r\n\r\nReferendum  proceedings are not secret judicial proceedings and  clause  52  (6)\r\n\r\nprovides  that  the  Referendum  Judge shall be  attended  at  the  trial  of  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  petition in the same manner as if he were a Judge of the High  Court\r\n\r\nsitting  at  the Assizes. But before the Judge can report those  who  have  been\r\n\r\nguilty  of corrupt or illegal practices, he is required under clause 57  (2)  to\r\n\r\ngive  such  persons  an  opportunity of being heard and of  giving  and  calling\r\n\r\nwitnesses  to  show  why  they should not be so reported.  The  proceedings  for\r\n\r\ncalling upon persons to show cause why they should not be separated are separate\r\n\r\nfrom the proceedings of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nreferendum  petition itself, and in such proceedings this Bill does  not  permit\r\n\r\nsecret  information available to the Judge on the referendum petition itself  to\r\n\r\nbe  used against them. Where then is the injustice of which the Member for Anson\r\n\r\ncomplains?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to involve you in a legal argument,\r\n\r\nbut  bear  with  me for a moment. The Minister says there is no  accused  person\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Referendum Judge. In truth and in fact, Sir, under clause  57  sub-clause (3):-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When a Referendum Judge reports that a corrupt or illegal practice has been\r\n\r\ncommitted  by  any person, that person shall be subject to the same incapacities\r\n\r\nas if at the date of the said report he had been convicted of that practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will see, Sir, he will be subject to the incapacities of standing for\r\n\r\nelection or voting, and, if he is an Assemblyman, he shall forthwith vacate  his\r\n\r\nseat according to the law if passed. Sir, it is said that before that can happen\r\n\r\nhe  must be given an opportunity to reply. But do not forget that already it has\r\n\r\nbeen proved in his absence that he is guilty. He is merely given the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  rebut.  To rebut what, Sir? [Interjection] The Minister is making noises  of\r\n\r\nprotest. Let me read it:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Before any person, not being a party to a referendum petition...'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>which  does not include the petitioner. Supposing I am a petitioner in  a  referendum  petition; I am not allowed to see those secret documents. I  can  be  condemned,  Sir, without any further ado. I can be condemned under sub-clause  (3).\r\n\r\nBut  supposing there are other persons who have never been in court;  the  Judge\r\n\r\nshall  call them before he makes that report naming them. And he shall ask  them\r\n\r\nto  give evidence to show cause why they should not be found guilty. You follow,\r\n\r\nSir, the presumption is one of guilt, the finding is there, and they are given a\r\n\r\nchance to rebut. Rebut what, Sir? Will the secret documents be read out to them?\r\n\r\nOh,  no, Sir. Have the secret documents had an effect on the Judge? Sir, if they\r\n\r\nwere  not supposed to have an effect, they would not be supplied with them.  So,\r\n\r\nwhere am I being misleading in saying to this Assembly that\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nin  truth and in fact a person can be deprived of his citizenship rights by  the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Judge  guided by secret documents of which the  poor  citizen  knows\r\n\r\nnothing, not even their existence. Is that fair enough? Not only that, Sir,  but\r\n\r\ninsofar  as the petitioner himself is concerned, he has no right even  of  being\r\n\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these penalties - let us look at the general issue. I bring a petition to say that through dishonest manoeuvering the P.A.P. has misled the people\r\n\r\ninto  thinking  that the Penang and Malacca type of merger means  depriving  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  their citizenship and, therefore, many of them have  been  misled.\r\n\r\nRight.  I  go  and  present my evidence. The Minister for Home Affairs  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Law submit memoranda to the State Advocate-General. According  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Law, it will be the duty of the State Advocate-General to send\r\n\r\nthose memoranda on.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Surely.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am glad he agrees, because I could quote chapter and verse.\r\n\r\nSome  people  study  the Bible. I have the unhappiness of combing  these  tragic\r\n\r\nproceedings from their inception last March.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is the duty of the State Advocate-General to submit the memoranda, and\r\n\r\nin  the  memoranda,  Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs  will  collect  all  the\r\n\r\nscandal \r\n\r\n- as  being reliable information - and you know, Sir, that does happen - you know the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch,  with a straight face, again and again and again  produces  so-called  reports from reliable sources which are of pure invention.  But  whether\r\n\r\ninvention or not, the point is that I, who am honestly, openly and publicly  presenting a petition in the public interest, have met with a blank wall. I do  not\r\n\r\neven know that documents have been produced, marked secret.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, you will say, \"Yes, but it will not be marked secret unless it was\r\n\r\nserious.\"  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I can assure you I know of an instance  where  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs chopped, as secret documents for  the  P.P.S.O.  Committee, newspapers which have been selling in Singapore at 10 cents a copy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nThose  were chopped as secret to the horror of the Judges who saw them. But  the\r\n\r\nminions   of  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs - they  no  doubt  have  their   instructions - 'when  in doubt mark it secret.' So they mark everything  secret.  In\r\n\r\nthat way they could not get into trouble with their bosses. So the petitioner is\r\n\r\nmet with a blank wall, and the poor Judge is in the acutely unhappy position  of\r\n\r\nnot  being able to tell him what is in the memoranda before him.

That is the answer to the Minister for Law. I do not\r\n\r\nsee.  My eye does not co-ordinate with my tongue. I wish the Minister could  see\r\n\r\nthe image that he presents.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, the motive of this provision is to make use of the name of the\r\n\r\nJudge  to cover up the P.A.P.'s crime. The Member for Anson has clearly  pointed\r\n\r\nout that this provision is unreasonable and is contrary to the procedure of law.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Law has just said that the Referendum  Judge\r\n\r\nhas  obtained the secret information from reports, but in those reports he  will\r\n\r\npoint  out  the  names  of those persons who are committed for  corruption.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for Law is seeking to explain and prove to the House that  the  secret\r\n\r\nreport  of  the Government is democratic. But in fact the Referendum  Judge  can\r\n\r\nindicate  in  his  memorandum the list of those persons who  are  committed  for\r\n\r\nbribery and corruption. Mr Speaker, we cannot accept\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhis  explanation. His explanation is grossly contrary to common sense. When  you\r\n\r\nsay  that a person is guilty, first of all, he has the right to ask what  he  is\r\n\r\nguilty  of. But under this provision this person has not the right to find  out\r\n\r\nwhat  crime  he has committed and against what provision in the law.  Concerning\r\n\r\nthe  secrecy of the report and information, we realise that the so-called secret\r\n\r\nreport  is  a report of the Special Branch. But is this secret report  reliable?\r\n\r\nAnd  will  the Referendum Judge he influenced and misled by this secret  report?\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  I  can say categorically that the Judge will be  misled  by  this\r\n\r\nsecret  information  and pass a wrong judgment. I can give  you  a  very  simple\r\n\r\nexample which the Government cannot deny.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few months ago the Singapore Chinese Secondary IV Examination created a\r\n\r\ncrisis. The Minister for Education, during a session of this House, submitted  a\r\n\r\nreport  to  the  House halfway during the sitting, saying that there  were  some\r\n\r\nCommunist elements exciting and propagating this examination boycott, that these\r\n\r\nelements participated in this boycott, and that Tommy Koh was one of them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Choa Chu Kang is going too much into details. The\r\n\r\nother objection is that the subject is the subject of a Commission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nLet  me  prove  to you that the information from the Special Branch  is  not  reliable. On that day Tommy Koh was in Kuala Lumpur but the Minister for Education-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point at issue is whether or not that information should be\r\n\r\ndisclosed or made use of in the manner suggested in the clause.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, my argument is this:\r\n\r\njust  as  you  have  directed this House, all information should  be  disclosed,\r\n\r\notherwise the person accused or judged will not be able to know what kind of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncrime he has committed. For instance, the incident of Tommy Koh. If the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education did not disclose that information in the Assembly, then Tommy Koh\r\n\r\nwould have been reported wrongly by the Special Branch that he had taken part in\r\n\r\nthe  agitation of the students' boycott. Mr Speaker, Sir, you can see from  the\r\n\r\nincident  of  Tommy  Koh  that the information of  the  Special  Branch  is  not\r\n\r\nreliable. Therefore, unreliable secret information should be disclosed to enable\r\n\r\nthe  accused to understand the source of this information and to enable  him  to\r\n\r\nhave a chance to prove to the Judge that he has not committed any crime of which\r\n\r\nhe has been accused.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs can present his secret report\r\n\r\nto the State Advocate-General for submission to the Judge. The Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs,  in addition to getting information from the Special Branch, can  also\r\n\r\nget other information from his\r\n\r\nP.A.P.     Branches. And he can also present such information to the  Judge.  If\r\n\r\nthis  secret information or report is not disclosed, then what about the  Government's  accusation that unionists, workers and cultural workers are engaging  in\r\n\r\nsubversive  activities, sabotaging Malaysia and merger? The  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs and the Government may make use of unreliable and groundless information\r\n\r\nto  prosecute  them. If this information is presented to the  Judge,  then  such\r\n\r\npeople  will be wronged and will have no chance to clear themselves.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nunder  such circumstances, the P.A.P. would be able to make use of the Judge  to\r\n\r\ndeal with their opponents and to escape the blame for their crime. Therefore, we\r\n\r\ncannot accept this provision. The argument of the Member for Anson is in keeping\r\n\r\nwith  the  basic demands and reasoning of the common people. It is important  to\r\n\r\nlet  the  accused  person know what he is accused of and the  grounds  for  such\r\n\r\naccusation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the words proposed to be left out, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee divided: Ayes, 17; Noes, 25; Absent, 9.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n        Ayes.

There must be these provisions if you  want  to  keep\r\n\r\nelections clean, and if you want to bring to book those who commit such offences\r\n\r\nas  general intimidation of voters, general bribery, general treating,  so  that\r\n\r\nyou  could get an election or a referendum declared void when those offences are\r\n\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  just now our Party Chairman has pointed  out  that  we  are\r\n\r\nobjecting  to  this particular provision because in it there are such  words  as\r\n\r\n\"confused\"  and  \"misled\". \"confused\" and \"misled\" cannot have a very  objective\r\n\r\ndefinition. For example, during the by-election in Hong Lim, the people did  not\r\n\r\nsupport  the P.A.P. Government, but the Government said that the people in  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  had  been misled. Then when the result of the Anson by-election was against\r\n\r\nthe Government, they, looking from their own point of view, said that the people\r\n\r\nin  Anson had been misled. So if you have this provision in the Bill, and should\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper be objected to and rejected by the people, the Government  can\r\n\r\nturn  round and say, \"Oh, the people have been misled again.\" So we want to  ask\r\n\r\nwhether it is the intention of this provision to declare the referendum null and\r\n\r\nvoid. We do not agree to this provision if it is so.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have the question of confusion.

If  the  manner in which the electorate vote and the ballot  papers  and\r\n\r\nsymbols  connected  therewith  are different from  those  used  in  the  general\r\n\r\nelections,  therefore, some of the electors, because of these  changes,  may  be\r\n\r\nconfused.  This confusion arises out of ballot papers, and so if the  Government\r\n\r\nallow  the  various Parties in Singapore to reproduce some documents similar  to\r\n\r\nthe  ballot  papers  to  explain to the people,  then  this  confusion  will  be\r\n\r\nconsiderably  reduced. But now it is not possible to do so and so we  feel  that\r\n\r\nshould  there  be any confusion at all, this confusion is brought about  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment itself and because of this we propose that this provision should  not\r\n\r\nbe incorporated in this Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, could I ask the Minister for Law to indicate the\r\n\r\nprovision  he  states  that  is copied from the Singapore  Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections Ordinance?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while the Minister for Law is looking up\r\n\r\nthe  Elections Ordinance, I just want to reply to one point raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Upper  Serangoon.

Let us examine the whole position. At the time of the referendum, the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties  Can  go Out to the electorate  to  explain  to  them  their\r\n\r\npolitical  stand  on merger. At the present moment, the Opposition  Parties  are\r\n\r\nagainst  the  White  Paper. Now, if we should, in our canvassing,  persuade  the\r\n\r\npeople to vote against the White Paper, then the Government can make use of this\r\n\r\nprovision  to  say  that  we are trying to confuse and  mislead  the  people  by\r\n\r\nintimidation.  So  I hope the Government can give an explanation  for  these  to\r\n\r\nwords,  otherwise  their so-called permission for canvassing work  by  political\r\n\r\nParties is all eyewash.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 54 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We now come back to the postponed clauses.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 2 is consequential on the amendment of clause 41.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page Al, line 16, at end, to add-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The period of any referendum\" means\r\n\r\nthe period from the date of the issue of the order of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nmade under the provisions of subsection (1) of section 5 of this Ordinance up to\r\n\r\nand including the day fixed for the taking of a referendum;'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"The period of any referendum\" is tied up with clause 41,\r\n\r\nand, read together, states what the period of any referendum means and what  can\r\n\r\nand cannot be done during that period.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 6 was postponed.

That majority  especially  when  it\r\n\r\nconcerns  a national matter is fifty-one per cent. Without this provision,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere will be a danger of the minority imposing its will on the majority and, as\r\n\r\nwe  all know, Sir, if a minority imposes its will on the majority, then it is  a\r\n\r\ndictatorship.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am strengthened in my belief, Sir, by a chance remark of the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  when  he said, if the majority is slim and the results close,  then  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  very  courageous for any Government to claim  that  a  referendum  is\r\n\r\ncarried.  It is a very important principle, Sir, and I am glad that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance, on that particular occasion,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nexpressed  his views so clearly, because we believe that the minority view  must\r\n\r\nnot be covered up and dressed up and presented as a majority view. It is because\r\n\r\nof  this  majority  principle on national matters that you  have  safeguards  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections  every few years. Sir, we realise that with  the  passing  of\r\n\r\nclause  29 the Government can easily turn a minority into a majority. I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  we  need  go  over  old ground, but I would nevertheless  urge  that  the\r\n\r\nMinisters at least listen to reason and logic on this occasion before they carry\r\n\r\nall  of  Singapore  along with them in their plunge to the depths  of  doom  and\r\n\r\nperdition.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also strengthened in my contention by the words of the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance on another occasion when he said that on any referendum the will of  the\r\n\r\nmajority  must  be  demonstrated beyond all doubt,  because,  according  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance, no proposition can be said to have the  support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople unless it is supported by the majority of the people beyond all doubt. To\r\n\r\npush  through  a  national issue without obtaining the genuine  support  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people of Singapore will not only be a mockery of democracy, but\r\n\r\nwill,  in fact, kill democracy in Singapore. I may even say this, Sir,  that  on\r\n\r\nmany national issues of less importance, governments have resigned and gone back\r\n\r\nto the people for a new mandate, but it looks as if the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  are  so desperate and want to cling to power so very much  that  they\r\n\r\nthink  only  of  themselves  and  not of the people  of  Singapore.  Merger,  as\r\n\r\neverybody  knows,  is  a major national issue; it concerns  everyone  of  us  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and future generations to come. The P.A.P. have always  boasted  from\r\n\r\nthe  very  first  day, when they started on their merger negotiations  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government, that their White Paper merger proposals have the  support\r\n\r\nof  the  people. I do not see any reason why they should fear to put it  to  the\r\n\r\ntest  and make sure that their merger proposals have the support of the majority\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore, at least fifty-one per cent.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was greatly amused, Sir, seeing the way the Government Ministers have been\r\n\r\ngoing  about,  how the Minister for Education not so very long  ago,  after  his\r\n\r\ninterview  with a school boy in a ward of the General Hospital, gave a statement\r\n\r\nto  the Press - I have not got the newspaper with me, Sir, but I can refer you  to\r\n\r\nthe  Straits Times of the 23rd of May, page 18, column 3, these are  the  words\r\n\r\nwhich I have copied down:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister for Education said, \"Democracy will only work where the views of\r\n\r\nthe  majority are accepted by the people and where the views of the minority are\r\n\r\nnot pushed\r\n\r\ndown the throats of others.\".'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>I  heartily  agree with him, Sir, and I only hope that the other Ministers  will\r\n\r\nshare  the  same  views as the Minister for Education. Unless  they  accept  our\r\n\r\namendment, it looks as if they will be pushing down the throats of others  their\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals. The Minister for Education further stated that only  Fascists\r\n\r\nand  Communists in the minority would like to force their views on the majority.\r\n\r\nSir,  these  are noble sentiments and nobody could disagree with him,  but  look\r\n\r\nwhat  has happened today. The Government already intends to turn a minority into\r\n\r\na majority through their clause 29.\r\n\r\nAnother short sentence of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education - he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is necessary for everyone to maintain democracy in Singapore-'\r\n\r\n<br><br>We all agree - \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'and to stand up for their rights and not be cowed by threats and\r\n\r\nintimidation.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Noble  words, Sir, and now we in the Opposition are standing for the  rights  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.

It was the  Second\r\n\r\nReading  of the Singapore National Referendum Bill and the Prime Minister  said,\r\n\r\nin page 31, third paragraph [Vol. 17, No. 3, col. 284]:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A referendum is a process - these are carefully chosen words for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Queenstown - [Well, I have listened, and I am quoting  him  to\r\n\r\nremind him\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nof  the  words he told me, Sir] by which we ascertain the wishes of the majority\r\n\r\nof the people.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And then further down he said it again:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am reasonably confident that this accords with the wishes of the majority\r\n\r\nof the people.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But if it so happens that the majority of the people want a different mode\r\n\r\nand manner .\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again \"the majority\", Sir.

Now,\r\n\r\nmay  I  refer you again, Sir, to the 18th of April when the Prime Minister spoke\r\n\r\non a motion by the Member for Anson.

As there was not a clear majority [these are very important words\r\n\r\n\"As there was not a clear majority\"]\r\n\r\nin that first referendum for any one of the\r\n\r\nthree issues, a second referendum was held.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, Sir, in the case of Newfoundland they had two referenda. In the\r\n\r\nfirst  one that was held, there was no clear majority. And because there was  no\r\n\r\nclear  majority, a second one had to be held to make sure that there was a clear\r\n\r\nmajority  on any one of the propositions put to the people. Then in column  210,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Arising out of that, it reinforces the argument. You see, Sir, it is a fair\r\n\r\ninference  to  say that that referendum must be in pursuance of  the  law  which\r\n\r\nrequired a clear majority of votes east in respect of one of the issues and, not\r\n\r\nhaving got that, they had to have a second referendum.'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>This should be clearly understood by the Minister for Health and Law.

It is in col. 300 of the\r\n\r\n15th  of  May  [Official  Report  of  Select  Committee  on  Singapore  National\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill  No. 5 dated 15th May, 1962]. And it is this paragraph  that  I\r\n\r\nreferred  to  as having strengthened my conviction that he possibly would  admit\r\n\r\nthe  logic  and common sense of our argument and maybe accede to our  amendment.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Finance says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I should imagine, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if the result of the referendum were\r\n\r\nso  close  as to show a difference of, say, 300 votes one way or the  other,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  a very audacious government to say one way or the other, because  the\r\n\r\npopulation has, for practical purposes, been split into half. I think  the  best\r\n\r\nway  and the reasonable thing for the government to do, under the circumstances,\r\n\r\nis either to hold another referendum or just leave matters at the status quo.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if there is no clear-cut majority. Sir, it would be a most\r\n\r\naudacious  government to claim that the referendum has been carried one  way  or\r\n\r\nthe  other.  And  300  votes is not good enough for the  Minister  for  Finance.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose, and he will admit, that at least 51 per cent would be  the\r\n\r\nminimum  for  a clear-cut majority. I may also mention here from the \"Plebeian\",\r\n\r\n8th of June, on page 3, an article by the Member for Anson. He was quoting \r\n\r\n- it  is  only a short paragraph - a few lines. It is in col. 2. The Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  said,  \"I  found in Hitler's law, on the 14th of July 1933,  under  which\r\n\r\nthree referendums were held in 1933, 1934 and 1938 -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is in section 3:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The majority of the votes for or against in a particular issue decides the\r\n\r\nresult of the plebiscite.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even Hitler had the gall to be openly dishonest, at least in this matter,\r\n\r\nas the P.A.P.

Therefore,  all  this\r\n\r\nshows  that  the Prime Minister, the Ministers for Home Affairs, for Health  and\r\n\r\nLaw,  and  for  Finance all recognise the logic of this 51 per cent  principle.\r\n\r\nBecause  the  essence  of  democracy  is  that  the  Government  must  be  truly\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the majority will of the people. I have explained to you that,\r\n\r\nbecause any government should represent the majority will of the people, we have\r\n\r\nthis  system  of  periodic  elections. Under  any  circumstances,  the  simplest\r\n\r\nmajority is fifty-one per cent. Therefore, if the Government are fair and  just,\r\n\r\nthey  have  no reason not to accept our amendment. Our claims are not excessive.\r\n\r\nThey are perfectly reasonable, especially when our contentions are reinforced by\r\n\r\nthese  words  of the Minister for Finance when he said that if the majority  was\r\n\r\nslim,  and  the  result was close, then the Government would be very  courageous\r\n\r\nindeed  if  they ever claimed that the referendum was carried. The  P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  said that they will follow the will of the people. So  there  is  no\r\n\r\nneed  to fear this fifty-one per cent provision, and they need not baulk at  and\r\n\r\nreject  it.  Let them make certain and demonstrate that they really  accept  the\r\n\r\nwill of the majority of the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper which they will be posing as one of the questions to the\r\n\r\npeople  has been much publicised. Day in and day out they say what a good  thing\r\n\r\nit  is over Radio P.A.P. and Rediffusion. Now is the time to put it to the  test\r\n\r\nand to show the people that their merger proposals really have the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nsupport  of the people.

And may\r\n\r\nI  refer  you,  Sir,  to  section 105 of the Singapore (Constitution)  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Assembly may, by law enacted under this Order, amend, add to, replace or\r\n\r\nrevoke  any of the provisions of this Order set out in the first column  of  the\r\n\r\nThird  Schedule  to this Order to the extent specified in the second  column  of\r\n\r\nthat Schedule:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that no Bill for that purpose shall be deemed to be passed unless at\r\n\r\nthe final vote thereon it has received the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of all the Members of the Assembly.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular case, Sir, it is not just the case of Members voting, but\r\n\r\nof  the  total  number of Members in the Assembly and it is laid down  that  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  two-thirds and not just 51 per cent.

In the case of Switzerland,  Bills\r\n\r\ncannot become laws unless they have the majority support of 51 per cent. In  the\r\n\r\ncase of Jamaica, may I refer you, Sir, to column 480 at the top. I was referring\r\n\r\nto  the  Referendum  Federation Law, 1960, section 3, subsection  (3),  and  the\r\n\r\nquotation is as follows:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the purpose of determining under this section the opinion of the people\r\n\r\nof  Jamaica  regard shall be had of the opinion expressed by a majority  of  the\r\n\r\nelectors voting at the referendum\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the electors voting - majority, that is, of course, 51 per cent minimum.\r\n\r\nThen, further down, Sir, I also quoted\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nfrom  the Statesman's Year-Book of 1958 which again tells you that it is a  case\r\n\r\nof  the  majority of all electors voting. Then, at the bottom of the same column\r\n\r\n480, it specifically explains how in South Australia a majority is constituted:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the purposes of ascertaining the result a majority shall be deemed to\r\n\r\nmean any number which is more than half the total number of votes recorded:'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is a clear indication that in any majority it must be 51 per cent.

I am trying to say that a simple\r\n\r\nmajority is not 51 per cent. I am having considerable difficulty from the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown  to understand this proposition which I thought would  be  self-evident to anyone who has passed Primary Five, but he has clearly not understood\r\n\r\nit.  Democracy demands that all issues should be made quite clear. So with  your\r\n\r\npermission,  Mr  Mammen.  Sir, I shall continue  with  this  lesson  in  simple\r\n\r\narithmetic to convince the Member for Queenstown beyond all doubt that a  simple\r\n\r\nmajority  does  not  mean 51 per cent. If I have made this point  clear  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown, then I think Mr Mammen, Sir, a great  blow  has  been\r\n\r\nstruck for democracy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, so far we have gone up to 100.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Now,\r\n\r\nis  that  a  simple majority or is that not a simple majority? I  have  asked  a\r\n\r\nsimple question, Mr Mammen, Sir, which admits of a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer\r\n\r\n- the sort of question the Member for Queenstown likes. Now, I say if he wants to\r\n\r\nchallenge me, I am prepared to sit down and listen to his other point  of  view.\r\n\r\nIf  you  have 1,000 voters, 501 vote \"Yes\", 499 vote \"No\", I say that there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a simple majority, but there has been less than 51 per cent. The light  of\r\n\r\ncomprehension dawns on his mind, Mr Speaker, Sir. So, if that is the case, need\r\n\r\nwe  go  to 10,000, need we go to 100,000, need we go to 600,000? I think  it  is\r\n\r\ncompletely  unnecessary, Mr Mammen, Sir. Obviously, the Member  for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nnow  concedes that a simple majority does not mean 51 per cent. He has taken  45\r\n\r\nminutes  of  the  time of this House on this completely erroneous,  this  simple\r\n\r\nfallacy which a schoolboy in the fourth standard would be ashamed to make. So we\r\n\r\nhave  cleared this point, Mr Mammen, Sir, that a simple majority does not  mean\r\n\r\n51  per  cent.  And  I  say a signal victory has been struck  in  the  cause  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  because the Member for Queenstown acknowledges this fact. Throughout\r\n\r\nthe  debate in Select Committee, everyone was trying to convince him  that  that\r\n\r\nwas not so; and when it came to the vote, he was the only one in support of this\r\n\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the other point I want to make is blank votes.

Obviously, that is too  difficult  for  him  to\r\n\r\ncomprehend.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he gave us some rigmarole about simple majority and things like that. I\r\n\r\nwish  he  had  listened to what I said when I started, and I  said  that  I  was\r\n\r\nstrengthened in my belief by what the Minister for Finance himself had  said.  I\r\n\r\nrefer you again, Sir, to col. 300 of the Official Report of the Select Committee\r\n\r\nof  15th  May,  1962.  I have already indicated to you and  enumerated  so  many\r\n\r\ninstances of a clear-cut majority.

I think  the  best\r\n\r\nway  and the reasonable thing for the government to do, under the circumstances,\r\n\r\nis either to hold another referendum or just leave matters at the status quo.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these words clearly show that the Minister for Finance admits that if it\r\n\r\nis  a  case of just one or two or three or four majority out of a large  number,\r\n\r\nthen  it  is not considered a majority even 300, according to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance,  is  not considered to be a majority of any consequence. He  has  \r\n\r\nrecommended  that  under  those circumstances, we either hold another  referendum  or\r\n\r\nleave  matters  just  at  the status quo. This is a  clear  admission  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance himself, and it is a pity that he never heard  me  when  I\r\n\r\nfirst began, otherwise he would not have queried and quoted all those small  \r\n\r\npiddling figures. What we want is a clear-cut majority. If it is the \r\n\r\nMinister's contention  that  he  does  not like the figure 51 per cent,  can  he  give  me  an\r\n\r\nassurance  that he will not consider the referendum carried unless  there  is  a\r\n\r\nmajority?

I have no wish to repeat what I  said  the\r\n\r\nother  night,  but  he  is asking me to do so again. This  explanation  or  this\r\n\r\nsupposition of the Minister for Finance is just an excuse to justify the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfor  their  pinching  blank votes as votes for the Government.  I  have  already\r\n\r\nexplained  to you, Sir, that this 51 per cent principle has nothing to  do  with\r\n\r\nblank votes. Any important national matter must have at least 51 per cent  or  a\r\n\r\nclear  majority -  if  he  does  not like the  words  \"51  per  cent\",  \"a  clear\r\n\r\nmajority\" - to  indicate that that issue has the support of the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. It is a very simple proposition, it has nothing to do  with\r\n\r\nblank votes one way or the other. However, just to take him on his argument that\r\n\r\nblank votes are supposed to be anti-government votes. According to the questions\r\n\r\nthat are going to be posed to the people - one is the P.A.P. merger and one is the\r\n\r\nso-called complete merger - both of them are on merger. I am telling the  Minister\r\n\r\nthat  blank votes do not mean anti-a or anti-b. If the Minister wants  to  claim\r\n\r\nthat they are anti-P.A.P. merger votes, similarly they can be anti-b, c, d, e, f\r\n\r\nand  g proposition votes. Therefore, supporters of the other propositions b,  c,\r\n\r\nd,  e,  f  and g, can similarly claim that they are anti- b, c, d, e,  f  and  g\r\n\r\nvotes.  Can  they not see their own illogical argument? That has nothing  to  do\r\n\r\nwith the 51 per cent principle, the majority principle.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Mammen,\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to remind the Member for Queenstown of what his colleague  in\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition said last night.

But this is a matter of judgment and a matter of policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It  is  not a matter of legislation. If the Member  for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nmakes  it  a  matter of legislation, and instead of 51 per cent, let  us  say  a\r\n\r\nmajority of the votes, then I think we would have been spared all these  tedious\r\n\r\narguments  on  what a clear majority means. But it is obvious that somewhere  in\r\n\r\nthe  process of his education, he has got his understanding of simple arithmetic\r\n\r\nmixed up, and therefore\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwe are subjected to an hour of completely unnecessary argument.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards blank votes, Mr Mammen, Sir, he does not understand why we ask him\r\n\r\nwhether  he  wants  to  pinch blank votes.

But every time they speak about blank votes, i.e. blank votes\r\n\r\nshould  count  as anti-merger votes, it provides further proof that  it  is  the\r\n\r\nintention of the Barisan Sosialis to induce people to cast blank votes  in  this\r\n\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Is that something new?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nothing new.

So\r\n\r\nperhaps  it will be better for the Minister for Finance to leave out that  point\r\n\r\nand  come back to this new clause.

All  I am saying is that every time the Barisan  Sosialis  make  a\r\n\r\nstatement  on blank votes, it all goes to prove their evil intention to  confuse\r\n\r\npeople  into casting blank votes.

He gave these examples to  show\r\n\r\nthat  51  per  cent is, in fact, not 51 per cent, but there is one  common  \r\n\r\ncharacteristic  in our argument, which is that the people casting \r\n\r\naffirmative  votes\r\n\r\nshould be more than half of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthose  casting  votes, and the Minister for Finance will not be able  to  \r\n\r\nrefute\r\n\r\nthis  argument.  The  common  characteristic is  that  the  votes  cast  in  \r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\naffirmative  should be over half. That is why we have mentioned 51 per  cent  \r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\nprovide  for  that fact. That is a very logical argument and is in keeping  \r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\ncommon  sense.  That  also is our principle in relation to this  amendment.  \r\n\r\nOur\r\n\r\ncontention  is  that as the matter is in relation to our constitutional\r\n\r\narrangements,  it  should get the support and consent of more than half of   \r\n\r\nthe  electorate\r\n\r\nbefore it can be put into effect.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Party Chairman has just now quoted the Singapore (Constitution) Order in\r\n\r\nCouncil  to  show that f you want to amend certain sections of the Constitution,\r\n\r\nit  needs a two-thirds majority of votes in the Assembly before an amendment can\r\n\r\nbe  carried, in the Federation there are also examples. Recently the  Government\r\n\r\nof  the Federation also introduced certain amendments to their Constitution. But\r\n\r\nthere are also provisions saying that although a two-thirds majority will not be\r\n\r\nrequired in future, the affirmative votes should be more than half of the  total\r\n\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question facing us is more serious than the other questions. That is why\r\n\r\nour  request  for  51  per  cent of the votes cast in the  affirmative  is  very\r\n\r\nreasonable  and  very  logical.  I would like  here  to  remind  politicians  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  Federation of Malaya that if  the  Federation  /  Singapore\r\n\r\nconstitutional arrangements cannot get the positive affirmative support of  more\r\n\r\nthan half of the people, then the consequences will be bad. I give an example. I\r\n\r\nmention  the  United  Arab Republic as an example to show how  the  United  Arab\r\n\r\nRepublic was later on divided again. That is a lesson from history.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I have already pointed out in the Select Committee\r\n\r\nproceedings  that  in a by-election or in a general election in  a  constituency\r\n\r\nwhere  the  votes are split even, an additional vote is given  by  lot  and  the\r\n\r\ncandidate  who  is lucky enough to get this additional vote is returned  as  the\r\n\r\ncandidate for that particular constituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so laid down in section 47 (8) of the Singapore Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nElections  Ordinance. Furthermore, in a constituency, if there are,  say,  three\r\n\r\ncandidates,  it is also possible for the votes to be split almost  even  amongst\r\n\r\nthese three candidates. The one who gets the highest number of votes is returned\r\n\r\nfor that particular constituency. But in the case of a referendum, anything that\r\n\r\nis  more than half - that is what the Minister for Finance has said just now - would\r\n\r\nbe  considered to be a simple majority. We cannot work on percentages like 51 or\r\n\r\n52 or 53.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am surprised at the examples given by the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  and Law. He brought up that example in the Select Committee and  it  was\r\n\r\nrebutted. The comparison is no comparison at all. He is bringing up the  example\r\n\r\nof  a  by-election concerning the individual, and he wants to compare it with  a\r\n\r\nnational matter that concerns 1.7 million people in the whole of Singapore. What\r\n\r\nsort of a comparison is that? But in spite of that, until now they have not even\r\n\r\nanswered  our questions. If they do not like the words \"51 per cent\",  are  they\r\n\r\nwilling  to accept the principle that it must be a clear-cut majority?  If  they\r\n\r\nare  willing to accept, let them say so. Let them say so categorically  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber.  If 51 per cent is not acceptable, we can come to certain arrangements.\r\n\r\nWe  will let them make the amendment. As long as it is a clear majority - if it is\r\n\r\n60  per  cent - good. Whatever it is. But it must be the majority  because  only\r\n\r\nthen  can you say that you have the majority support of the people. In no  other\r\n\r\nway  can you say that you have the majority support of the people. I have quoted\r\n\r\nthe  sayings of all the Ministers: the Prime Minister, the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Home Affairs, the Minister for Health and Law, and  even  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education. I quoted all of them, Sir, a little while back. Are they\r\n\r\ngoing to live up to  their words or are they going to eat their words again?

Its purpose is to reunite\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Federation of Malaya.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>Surely, Sir, nothing could be clearer and there was no dissentient voice on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment benches as to the fact that this was a specific Bill exclusively  for\r\n\r\nmerger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They emphasised it, Sir, when one month later I moved a motion seeking a\r\n\r\nreferendum in respect of the White Paper proposals, and on that day the Deputy\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nPrime  Minister moved an amendment, to which I referred earlier, and  in  moving\r\n\r\nthat  amendment, Sir, he said, on the 17th of April, at page 8  of  the  revised\r\n\r\ntranscript [Vol. 17, No. 8, col. 774]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, as I have already explained, the Minister for Home Affairs last year,\r\n\r\nduring  the debate on merger, introduced the Singapore National Referendum  Bill\r\n\r\nwith  one prospect, and that was to enable the people of Singapore in their  own\r\n\r\ninterest  to  go to a referendum to state specifically how the reunification  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation should be brought about.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  the original Bill itself, Sir - and I would like to draw your attention to  it\r\n\r\nas  a  matter of curiosity - you will find at page 23 under \"Expenditure of Public\r\n\r\nMoney\",  this Explanatory Statement at the end of the Bill: \"This Bill  will  involve the Government in an estimated expenditure of $400,000.\" We have been\r\n\r\ntold by the Minister for Finance that it costs $400,000 to hold one referendum.\r\n\r\nIf  any further confirmation was required, there is a confirmation that the Bill\r\n\r\nwas\r\n\r\nintended at that juncture for one referendum - the only referendum anybody  inside\r\n\r\nor outside this House had in mind. On that basis, the Bill was committed to\r\n\r\nSelect Committee. On that basis the opposition filed its amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Mr Speaker, the heavy weather we had in Select Committee\r\n\r\nwhen the Government through its three Ministers - the Minister for Home Affairs in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  the  Bill,  the  Minister for Law  and  the  Minister  for  Finance - repeatedly stated that they could not accept the Opposition's amendments because\r\n\r\nthe  Bill was a general Bill for all referenda, including possible referenda  on\r\n\r\ntoddy  shops,  smoking  and the Malay language. I draw attention  to  this,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, not merely to rub salt in the wound - the wound is ours, Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\npeople's.  I  draw attention to this devious and dishonest conduct in  order  to\r\n\r\nexplain how by these dishonest tactics in Select Committee the Ministers  sought\r\n\r\na  facade  of  logic for the rejection of legitimate Opposition  amendments  and\r\n\r\nforced the Select Committee into a discussion of the Bill on false premises.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer, for example, Sir, to the very first day, when the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill in utter exasperation said, at column 108 [Official Report of Select\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nCommittee on Singapore National Referendum Bill No. 3 dated 8th May, 1962]:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In regard to the point raised by the Minister for Finance that this is a\r\n\r\ngeneral  law,  we  all know that this Bill is introduced to  meet  the  proposed\r\n\r\nreferendum on merger.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>He went on, and you, Sir, as Chairman, pulled him up:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Order. I must pull the Member back to the idea that this, in fact, is a\r\n\r\ngeneral Bill, and as the Minister for Finance has indicated...'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a manoeuvre of the Government to treat the Bill as a general Bill in\r\n\r\nthe  semblance  of logic to some of the objections they raised  to  Opposition's\r\n\r\namendments both in Select Committee and in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is pertinent to see how they sought to destroy the logic of our amendments by this dishonest manoeuvre that we were dealing with a general Referendum\r\n\r\nBill  for  toddy shops, smoking and the Malay Language. Let us take only  a  few\r\n\r\nexamples:  I am not here, Mr Speaker, to filibuster, nor can I hope to  achieve\r\n\r\nmore than to register a constitutional protest.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take clause 5, Sir, In the debate in Select Committee, the Minister for\r\n\r\nLaw  stated, on the issue whether the Assembly should frame the question - I refer\r\n\r\nyou to column 110, the very first day:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My point here, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that this is a general referendum Bill.\r\n\r\nIf  there  was  before  the Committee a Bill dealing with a specific  referendum\r\n\r\nissue,  there  is nothing to prevent the Legislative Assembly from deciding  the\r\n\r\nquestions to be put to a Referendum.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have a specific Referendum Bill, but no questions framed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At column 118 of the same day, still on the same clause, the same Minister for\r\n\r\nLaw said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, this is a general referendum Bill. There might be various matters. One\r\n\r\nis  the  matter  of smoking - whether the public should be allowed to  smoke.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anion does not like smoking. One day we might hold a referendum  on\r\n\r\nthis. That is one matter. Merger is another matter.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>You  see? Sir, merger is as if of no more importance than smoking. These matters\r\n\r\ninvolve all sorts of questions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, at column 138 on the 8th of May:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Member for Anson has moved an amendment that there shall be only one\r\n\r\nquestion on one issue. Mr Chairman, I have pointed out repeatedly that this  is\r\n\r\na  general Referendum Bill and there is a procedure in the Bill for the  putting\r\n\r\nof  questions. But the difficulty is to put the questions. Quite apart from  the\r\n\r\nprecedents that I have brought to the notice of this Committee, when we met  the\r\n\r\nrespective  associations that came here, it was pointed  out  that  difficulties\r\n\r\ncould   arise  in  the  putting  of  questions.  For  instance,  there  may   be\r\n\r\ncircumstances where it is not possible to put a single question - the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson admitted that just now. Take the case of toddy shops . . . [and then]  the\r\n\r\nMalay language.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law has the assistance of the Minister for Finance in this dishonest manoeuvre to confuse the Select Committee. I refer to the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance's  statement still on this clause. At col. 131 - still on the  very  first\r\n\r\nday, this is very interesting:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is an advantage, in principle, in\r\n\r\nrestricting a referendum to posing one question.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>I  wonder  how he will try to dodge that when we come to the issue of  the  questions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is an advantage, in principle, in restricting a referendum to posing\r\n\r\none  question.  But  whether that should apply to all  referenda  which  may  be\r\n\r\ncarried out in future I am not so certain.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And he went on to refer to the Malay language and whether it should be official\r\n\r\nin three, seven or ten years.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, at column 134, the Minister for Finance stated:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In view of the practice in other countries, I think it is unduly restrictive\r\n\r\nin  the  general  referendum  law - such as we are considering  now - to  limit  the\r\n\r\nquestions of the type which require only a yes or no answer.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it fair to state that by inference he would have been prepared in a\r\n\r\nspecific referendum law to permit a question which requires a yes or a no?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, on the question of forms. You know that in Australia and in other\r\n\r\nlegislation  which we have examined, there are always Schedules of the  form  of\r\n\r\nballot paper and of the form of the Superintendent's returns. In fact, Sir,  our\r\n\r\nown Elections Ordinance has seventeen forms in the Schedule including a form  of\r\n\r\nballot paper and a form or returns.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Minister for Home Affairs to say on the amendment of the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown to introduce\r\n\r\na Schedule to provide for a ballot paper?\r\n\r\nI refer to column 228 [Official Report of\r\n\r\nSelect Committee on Singapore National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill No. 4 dated 11th May,\r\n\r\n1962]:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a difference between the Jamaican Referendum\r\n\r\nOrdinance and this Bill. This is a general referendum Bill. The Jamaica one is a\r\n\r\nspecific  one;  and  therefore  the  ballot paper  could  be  suitably  designed\r\n\r\nbeforehand  for that particular referendum. The Schedule proposed  will  not  be\r\n\r\nsuitable  or  appropriate  to the nature of this Bill which  covers  all  future\r\n\r\nreferenda and not one particular referendum.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, we now have one particular referendum, and the Minister had before\r\n\r\nhim the model of Jamaica. He did admit that where there is a specific referendum\r\n\r\nin mind, one can draft an appropriate paper. Has he done it? This attitude, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  rejecting  the  ballot  paper  which the Member  for  Queenstown  sought  to\r\n\r\nintroduce was supported by the Minister for Law. At column 233, if I might  read\r\n\r\nonly  excerpts instead of reading a long column - Mr Speaker, you  can  check  my\r\n\r\naccuracy:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister for Home Affairs has quite rightly pointed out that this is a\r\n\r\ngeneral  referendum Bill and we cannot possibly frame Schedules on the forms  of\r\n\r\nquestions in such a Bill.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, according to the Minister for Law\r\n\r\non a specific Bill, a little later he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We have shown good reasons why we cannot frame Schedules on the forms of\r\n\r\nquestions in a general referendum Bill. It is not possible.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And again, a little down - the way they obstruct us; the way they are unashamedly,\r\n\r\ncalculatedly dishonest:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There are so many different matters on which referenda can be held and so\r\n\r\nmany  different questions can be posed in each referendum. So it is not possible\r\n\r\nto do that.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>That is on the ballot paper.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot have questions, because it is a general Bill. We cannot have a yes\r\n\r\nor no, because it is a general Bill. We cannot have a ballot paper because it is\r\n\r\na general Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to the returns of the Superintendent where, again in answer to the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown's efforts to clarify the Bill and to make it conform to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nconstitutional principles - he has introduced a Schedule incorporating a form  of\r\n\r\nreturn  by the Superintendent - this is what the Minister for Home Affairs had  to\r\n\r\nsay  on  16th  of  May,  at column 388 [Official Report of Select  Committee  on\r\n\r\nSingapore National Referendum Bill No.\r\n\r\n6]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Finally, one common form of statement prescribed in the Bill, which is a\r\n\r\ngeneral  referendum Bill, may not be suitable for use on all  occasions  when  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  is  held.  The  declaration  of  the  result  of  the  poll  is   an\r\n\r\nadministrative matter and it is for the Superintendent to compile the  statement\r\n\r\nin  the form best suited for a particular referendum. It is a general referendum\r\n\r\nBill. We should not have a Schedule which will be only suitable for a particular\r\n\r\ntype of referendum.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, according to him, this is now for a particular type of a referendum.

In the next column 389, you will find the same Minister, the Minister for Home Affairs:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said, this Bill is a general referendum Bill and\r\n\r\nwe  should not have in it a definite form of Schedule which cannot be applicable\r\n\r\nfor all occasions.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, on the same day, Sir, at column 392:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In fact, I consulted my officials on this matter and they advised against it,\r\n\r\nbecause  no one can anticipate what type of referendum or what type of  question\r\n\r\nwill  be  posed  in  future, and it is difficult to design a  set  Form  in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule to this Bill.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>Well,  Sir, have these officers also advised him now that he cannot draft a  set\r\n\r\nForm for a specific Referendum Bill? Why not?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us hear what the Minister for Finance had to say, Sir, In the same column,\r\n\r\nthat is column 392:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This is a general referendum Bill. We are trying to straitjacket everything\r\n\r\ninto  a  set pattern to \"as near as may be\".

I am\r\n\r\nnot  going  to weary you with more, Sir. The purpose is merely to highlight  the\r\n\r\nway  this  House has been kicked about in a most shameful exhibition  within  my\r\n\r\nexperience in the last seven years.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have made my point that this Bill, which was dealt with by the\r\n\r\nGovernment on the Second Reading as a specific Referendum Bill for the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nspecific purpose of the merger, was, in Select Committee, treated as a  general\r\n\r\nBill  and had the Government Members been honest or at least consistent, if  not\r\n\r\nhonest, then there would have been no arguments in Select Committee against  the\r\n\r\ninclusion  of  provisions for the Assembly to frame the questions, inclusion  of\r\n\r\nprovisions for an answer of 'yes' or 'no', inclusion of provisions for a  ballot\r\n\r\npaper  where the answer was 'yes' Or 'no', inclusion of provisions for a  return\r\n\r\nby  the  Superintendent of the polling results. The attempts to introduce  those\r\n\r\nlegitimate  provisions  and  specific  law  were  shut  out  by  this  dishonest\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we come to this House, I would like to remind you of the time\r\n\r\nchronologically.  The Second Reading when the Government had made  up  its  mind\r\n\r\nthat  this  was a specific Bill was 16th and 17th March. The Ministers,  in  the\r\n\r\nabsence abroad of the Prime Minister, decided in Select Committee to treat  this\r\n\r\nBill  as a general Bill. This was between the 8th of May and, I think, the  16th\r\n\r\nor 17th of May. Recommittal of the Bill started on the 27th of June. Between the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading  and  the  Committee Stage two  months  had  passed. Between\r\n\r\nCommittee stage and recommittal here in public, we had a little over a month. On\r\n\r\nthe first two days, Sir, the 27th and 28th of June, last Wednesday and Thursday.\r\n\r\nthe  Government sought to keep up this dishonest suggestion that it is a general\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill. The Deputy Prime Minister at page 91 of the transcript  of  the\r\n\r\n27th of June [Vol. 18, No. 1, col. 127] said:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I think the great difficulty in our discussions in this\r\n\r\nCommittee  is to come back to the point - to the amendments which are being  moved\r\n\r\nin the National Referendum Bill.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>That  was his great difficulty, Sir, to bring us to the point, and what  is  the\r\n\r\npoint?  The  main contention of the Opposition is that the Bill  should  contain\r\n\r\nprovisions for only one question to be asked. I pointed out during the debate on\r\n\r\nthe  motion moved by the Member for.Anson on the 17th of April, 1962,  that  the\r\n\r\nNational Referendum Bill was a general Referendum Bill. He did\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nnot point that out; on the contrary, he made exactly the opposite statement.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  on the 17th that this Bill was for one prospect only, the merger prospect.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Sir, we have Hansard. Some comfort, some comfort! Then, Sir,  if  I\r\n\r\nmight  skip the middle part because I do not wish to weary you, and  go  to  the\r\n\r\nlatter  half,  \"I  put  to you a very simple question\" still  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  \"If it is agreed that the National Referendum Bill is a general  Bill\r\n\r\nfor  referenda that may be held in the future, it is pretty obvious that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible  to pre-determine, the nature of the question that may  be  asked.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  allowance  must  be  given to the  fact  that  the  question  to  be\r\n\r\nformulated in future years will vary according to the problem that is put before\r\n\r\nthe people.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this shameless specious humbug, he sought to field the legitimate request,\r\n\r\nthe  legitimate amendment moved. And in that very statement, Sir, it is  clearly\r\n\r\nimplied that if the Bill were a specific Bill for referendum on merger, then not\r\n\r\nonly  could  the  questions but the questions should be formulated  in  the  law\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday, Sir, only Thursday last, the 28th of June, the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance at page 42, second paragraph [Vol. 18, No. 2, col. 205]:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let me get down to the gist of the matter. These people (that is us, Sir)\r\n\r\nwant  the referendum to contain only one question, which will admit only a \"yes\"\r\n\r\nor \"no\" answer. We have stated quite correctly that in a general Referendum Bill\r\n\r\nsuch a limitation is unnecessarily restrictive.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Right now, this is a specific Referendum Bill; obviously it is not unnecessarily\r\n\r\nrestrictive. Do we have such a provision? No. It was still a general  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill to Thursday, the 28th of June. On the next day, Sir, the 29th of June,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law supported his colleagues on the same ground that, as this is  a\r\n\r\ngeneral Referendum Bill, there could not be a provision that there should be one\r\n\r\nquestion  and  that the answer should be a 'yes' or 'no'. This is a particularly\r\n\r\nedifying passage and I crave your indulgence if I read it out\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfull.  I  refer to page 14 of the transcript of Friday, the 29th of June  [Vol.\r\n\r\n18, No. 3, col. 303]. The Minister said:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, we on the Government side have all along maintained that\r\n\r\nthis Bill is a general Referendum Bill...'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust I have said enough to prove how\r\n\r\nfalse that statement is.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. . . and that it would be improper to incorporate in it a provision like the\r\n\r\namendment  proposed which would have the effect of limiting  the  scope  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  The Member for Anson argued that if it was clearly the intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to use this Bill for the purpose of holding a referendum on  merger,\r\n\r\nwould  the  Government not have acted more appropriately and  fairly  if  it  introduced a specific Referendum Bill to hold a referendum on merger? He said that\r\n\r\nthis was done in all countries where referenda were held. Is there any merit  in\r\n\r\nthis argument?'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And,  Sir,  the curious thing is, the Minister for Finance on the  previous  day\r\n\r\ncharged  me  for  not  asking for a specific Bill. But on  the  29th  June,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Law  found  no merit in the suggestion that  there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nspecific Referendum Bill. But let us read on:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. . . All Bills which deal with referenda matters, whether they are called\r\n\r\ngeneral  Referendum  Bills  or  specific  Referendum  Bills,  must  provide  the\r\n\r\nmachinery whereby questions can be put to the electorate, and whereby the choice\r\n\r\nof the electorate can be ascertained through the usual electoral procedures.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, notice this. The only\r\n\r\ndifference between a Bill to hold a\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nreferendum on a specific issue and a\r\n\r\ngeneral Referendum Bill is that in the\r\n\r\nformer the questions are framed as a\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nclause in the Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now it is admitted that this is a specific Referendum Bill. Is there a\r\n\r\nclause incorporating the question? No.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, may I refer you to the Minister for Finance who on the 28th June\r\n\r\nsaid specifically that some of our amendments were unacceptable because they are\r\n\r\ninappropriate to a general Referendum Bill. And, by necessary inference, implied\r\n\r\nthat if this were a specific Referendum Bill, of course, the Government, would\r\n\r\naccept them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is at page 41 of the transcript of the 28th June [Vol. 18, No. 2, col.\r\n\r\n205]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Some proposed amendments are unacceptable,' he said, 'because they are\r\n\r\ninappropriate to a general Referendum Bill, and others are because the Bill will\r\n\r\nbe used to carry out a referendum on merger.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice the next day the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Law said there was no merit in any suggestion for a specific  law,\r\n\r\nbut  notice what the Minister for Finance said on the 28th June on page 42 [Vol.\r\n\r\n18, No. 2, col. 205]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The hon. Member even offered the utterly preposterous suggestion that in\r\n\r\naddition  to this general Referendum Bill, we should have a specific  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill  on  merger. Sir, I can see some point, in logic, if he maintains  that  we\r\n\r\nshould scrap this general Referendum Bill and in its place have one specifically\r\n\r\nfor the referendum on merger. I can see some point in this.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, on the very first day in Select Committee, I asked the Government for\r\n\r\na  specific Referendum Bill. I refer to column 135. [Official Report  of  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee on Singapore National Referendum Bill No. 3 dated 8th May, 1962]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would the Government consider introducing legislation on the basis of the\r\n\r\nJamaican Referendum Federation Law, 1960, specifically dealing with a change  of\r\n\r\nconstitutional status, .\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Sir, we went on and at column\r\n\r\n136 you pulled me up, and you said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. . .the Member for Anson has a method:\r\n\r\nhe can move a motion for leave to bring in a Bill.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had that in mind, Sir, and as you\r\n\r\nare aware, after the conclusion of the Select Committee on this Bill, I did send\r\n\r\nyou on the 14th June a motion reading:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for a referendum to be held\r\n\r\nto  ascertain  the  wishes of the adult citizens of Singapore  on  the  proposed\r\n\r\ncloser relations with the Federation of Malaya in Paper Command 33 of 1961.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had, in fact, drafted a simple Bill. I believe an adequate Bill based on the\r\n\r\nJamaican  Ordinance,  and you no doubt will remember, Sir,  that  on  the  19th,\r\n\r\nthrough  the Clerk of the Assembly, you informed me that my motion  was  out  of\r\n\r\norder. May I, Sir, read just one paragraph - paragraph 6 - thereof? This is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nparagraph 6 of the letter of the Clerk of the decision:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The proposed motion of the Member for Anson therefore in effect ignores the\r\n\r\nvote  of  the Assembly agreeing to the Second Reading of the Singapore  National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill, paragraph 2 above, and the vote of the Assembly as embodied  in\r\n\r\nthe  resolution of the 18th April, 1962, paragraph 5 above. These votes indicate\r\n\r\nthat the Assembly has agreed in principle that the Singapore National Referendum\r\n\r\nBill will be the vehicle whereby a referendum on the merger issue will be taken.\r\n\r\nThe  proposed motion of the Member for Anson is therefore a reflection on  these\r\n\r\nvotes, and on this ground the notice thereof cannot be allowed.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only the Government that could\r\n\r\nintroduce a Bill for a specific referendum or could have modified this Bill even\r\n\r\nat this late stage into an appropriate Bill for a referendum on merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, we have reached now the\r\n\r\nsecond  day  of  debate here - the 28th June and part of the  29th  June - and  then\r\n\r\nsuddenly,  Sir, on the 29th June, a little on in the afternoon,  I  was  drawing\r\n\r\nattention to the curious conduct of the Deputy Prime Minister in these words. At\r\n\r\npage 31 [Vol. 18, No. 3, col.\r\n\r\n330], Sir, I said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We now go back to the curious somersault of the Deputy Prime Minister. I am\r\n\r\ntold  that was unfortunate. It came about unfortunately because he did not  hear\r\n\r\nthe  expos\ufffd earlier on of how I indicated that they had all said that it  was  a\r\n\r\nspecific provision for a specific purpose. I think he said \"one prospect  only\",\r\n\r\nSir;  I take it whichever way you read P.A.P. English, \"one prospect only\" means\r\n\r\none purpose only.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>That  was  with  reference to his speech in April. And  here  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister interjected across the Floor, and said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All right, let us make it one purpose.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And an hour or so later we had the Minister for Home Affairs, very sheepishly at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  a  speech  to the point where I had heard  him  indistinctly,  but\r\n\r\nobviously it was heard by the Official Reporter. He said this, Sir, at  page  50\r\n\r\n[Vol. 18, No. 3, col. 360]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, I take it that it is the wish of the Opposition that this Bill\r\n\r\nshould not be a general Bill and that it should apply only to the referendum  on\r\n\r\nmerger.  Now that being the case, the Government are prepared to scrap the  Bill\r\n\r\non merger with the Federation.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, he tried that again today, although it was pointed out to him that\r\n\r\nwhat  was  objected to was not its general character, but its odious  provisions\r\n\r\nand  the  fact that it did not follow constitutional precepts in the framing  of\r\n\r\nlegislative provisions for a specific referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that we had the amendment which you heard since dinner time, this\r\n\r\ninelegant Part VI:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This Ordinance shall cease to have effect on the merger of Singapore with the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>So,  we  have come full cycle after having kicked this Assembly round and  round\r\n\r\nfrom specific on the Second Reading in March, to general in Select Committee  in\r\n\r\nMay and the first two days of this sitting in June, to specific this week.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore, Mr Speaker, before us today I think incontrovertibly in\r\n\r\nany  language, except P.A.P. language, a Bill that is truthfully an abortion  in\r\n\r\nthat  it is drafted neither on the principles of a general nor on the principles\r\n\r\nof  a  specific Bill for a referendum. Now that we recognise it is a  Bill,  not\r\n\r\nmerely  intended,  but  by law, required to be used, only for  ascertaining  the\r\n\r\nwishes of the people on the proposed closer relations with the Federation, I say\r\n\r\nit  is inappropriate in that in a specific Bill for that specific purpose, there\r\n\r\nshould  be,  according to the Minister for Law himself, in  the  Bill  itself  a\r\n\r\nclause incorporating the questions to be asked of the people. I have read to you\r\n\r\nthat  passage  where he said he had examined all laws and the  only  distinction\r\n\r\nbetween  general referendum Bills and specific referendum Bills is that specific\r\n\r\nreferendum Bills have a clause incorporating the questions. This was at page 14,\r\n\r\nif you remember, on the 29th of June [Vol. 18, No. 3, col. 303]. Furthermore, in\r\n\r\na  specific  Referendum Bill, according to the statement  of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance on the 28th of June, page 42 [Vol. 18, No. 2, col. 205], it would not be\r\n\r\nappropriate to have a provision whereby the answer should be yes or no. I would\r\n\r\nlike to quote him exactly. Page 42:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'These people want the referendum to contain only one question, which will\r\n\r\nadmit only a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. We have stated quite\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncorrectly  that in a general Referendum Bill such a limitation is  unnecessarily\r\n\r\nrestrictive.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, you will recognise that in the Singapore Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nElections  Ordinance,  as  in all other Ordinances dealing  with  elections  and\r\n\r\nreferenda, there are, as I pointed out, some 17 Forms, and if this was  a  specific  Referendum Bill, then there should be at least the Form of a ballot  paper.\r\n\r\nYou  will  remember, Sir, that the Member for Queenstown moved a Form in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  which  is the one at page 146 of our Supplement No. 17,  whereby  the\r\n\r\nballot  paper is given and the answer is required to be a yes or a no. When  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs on the 11th of May at col. 228 of the Official 'Report\r\n\r\nof  the  Select Committee said, \"This is a general Referendum Bill. The  Jamaica\r\n\r\none is a specific one; and therefore the ballot paper could be suitably designed\r\n\r\nbeforehand  for that particular referendum,\" - I do not want to repeat it,  Sir - on\r\n\r\nhis own showing that since this is a specific one, we could copy Jamaica; and he\r\n\r\nrecognizes that there should be a Form of a ballot paper and that there would be\r\n\r\nno  objection  to the Form indicated by the Member for Queenstown.  We  have  no\r\n\r\nForm.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of returns of the Superintendent, it is another Form that is\r\n\r\nmissing. I have drawn your attention to the statement of the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs who ended up by telling you pathetically that he had consulted his\r\n\r\nofficials and that they were against a Form of returns because no one can\r\n\r\nanticipate what type of referendum or what kind of questions will be posed in\r\n\r\nfuture and it is difficult to design a set Form. His entire approach, Sir, to be\r\n\r\nseen from col. 388 [Official Report, Select Committee on Singapore National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill No. 6 dated 16th May, 1962] - and the approach of the Government - was that because this is a general Referendum Bill, we should not have\r\n\r\nany Forms: Now, this is a specific 'Referendum Bill, still should not have\r\n\r\nany forms. Mr Speaker, I sought to prove to you - and I trust you have noticed\r\n\r\nthis - by the words of the Government Ministers, not the words of the Opposition,\r\n\r\nthat this Bill is inadequate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nin  that it lacks essential elements which the Government Ministers (not  Government  Back benchers or the Opposition) indicate would have been most appropriate\r\n\r\nin  a  specific Bill. Now, it is a specific Bill and we still do not have  them.\r\n\r\nAnd  what  are  those elements? They are four in number, Sir, according  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment:  (i)  a  clause  incorporating  the  questions  to  be  asked;  (ii)\r\n\r\nprovisions for an answer - yes or no; (iii) a schedule giving the Form  of  ballot\r\n\r\npaper which would include provisions for the answer to be yes or no; and (iv)  a\r\n\r\nschedule giving Forms of the Superintendent's returns. Why are they lacking, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker?  They  are lacking because the Government have set out  consciously  to\r\n\r\nseek legal cover for dishonest manoeuvre.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constitutionally, as the Minister for Law states correctly, a law can provide\r\n\r\nthat  a  man shall be deemed a woman. The law can provide that what is dishonest\r\n\r\nis  honest, that what is false is deemed true. Yes, constitutionally the law can\r\n\r\nso provide. But there have so far not been found any human beings\r\n\r\nor  any government which so lack human decency and human shame and have so  much\r\n\r\ncontempt  for  the  people, to exercise that power, until the P.A.P. came  into\r\n\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have shown you that it is inadequate. Now I want to show you why it is\r\n\r\ninappropriate. You will remember, Sir, that the purpose, according to the motion\r\n\r\nof  the  18th of April, is \"to ascertain the wishes ...\" - that is the  operative\r\n\r\nphrase.  Now, how is this Bill going to work? Let us start off with  clause  21,\r\n\r\nSir. Under this clause, every citizen must vote. If he refuses to vote or if  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not vote his name is struck off the electoral register and he cannot  vote\r\n\r\nor stand for election for\r\n\r\nseveral  years until that register is revised and until he has paid  a  fine  or\r\n\r\ngiven  a  satisfactory explanation. But the point is, Sir, that if he  does  not\r\n\r\nvote  at  this referendum, he will be deprived of voting at next year's  general\r\n\r\nelection,  or  for  standing for election himself. But that is immaterial;  that\r\n\r\naffects only a few. I will not say \"immaterial\", but that affects a few. But the\r\n\r\nimportant\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npoint  is that the names of those who do not vote at the referendum, because  it\r\n\r\ngoes  against their conscience to vote for what is before them, will  be  struck\r\n\r\noff  the electoral register and they will not vote at the next general election,\r\n\r\nand  the  P.A.P. would be only too happy if that happens to all those  who  hate\r\n\r\nthis  Bill because with those remaining, they can fight for them with the S.P.A.\r\n\r\nand stand the possible chance of getting a few into the Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, our voter is compelled to go to the polling booth. In the polling\r\n\r\nbooth, he will be presented with a ballot paper. On that ballot paper, according\r\n\r\nto the motion of the Prime Minister who by the grace of the S.P.A. can have what\r\n\r\nhe will of this country, there will be two questions. One will be on the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. merger proposals - Cmd. Paper\r\n\r\n33  of  1961. Now, Sir, that is a perfectly fair and proper alternative to  put,\r\n\r\nnot  merely because there are many people who honestly think it is good, and who\r\n\r\nwant it, and I can assure you, Sir, many of my friends honestly believe that  it\r\n\r\nis  good and sincerely want it, but also it has been fully discussed in this  Assembly;  because it has some precision, although the draft constitution  is  not\r\n\r\nbefore  us, nevertheless there is a Command Paper which has spelt it out.  So  I\r\n\r\nsay  that one is a fair proposition. Now, if the voter does not want it, he will\r\n\r\nhave  another one, Sir, and the other one is a complete and unconditional merger\r\n\r\nas  a  State on an equal basis with the other 11 States in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional  Documents of the Federation of Malaya.

But, no, Sir. Those repeated  attempts  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to  give our people a chance to say yes or no have  been  repeatedly\r\n\r\ndefeated by the Government and their friends and allies across the Floor on  the\r\n\r\nFront benches of the Opposition. No, Sir. The people are going to be told,  \"You\r\n\r\nhave a choice. Your choice is to strike out the one you do not want, or to put a\r\n\r\ncross  against the one you want\". But if you do not want Cmd. Paper 33,  and  if\r\n\r\nyou do not want the alternative, what are you to do? You cannot say \"no\" to both\r\n\r\nbecause  if  you  put  \"no\" to both, that will be deemed to  be  ambiguous  and,\r\n\r\naccording to clause 29, it will be a P.A.P. vote for Cmd. Paper 33 although  you\r\n\r\nspecifically  say \"no\". You cannot leave it blank, Sir - better at least  than  it\r\n\r\ncounting  as a Government vote - because if you leave it blank you are a Communist\r\n\r\nconfused stooge and are deemed to vote for the Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the perfidy of clause 29 which\r\n\r\nhas shaken even the Member for Bras Basah, who was able until now to stomach  so\r\n\r\nmuch that was dishonest in this Government. And not only has she been disgusted,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker - I tell you quite frankly that I move in circles where daily I  meet\r\n\r\nfar more people who want Cmd. Paper 33 than those who do not, but never mind the\r\n\r\nargument about it, Sir, they feel it is good and they say we should have  it - but\r\n\r\neven they, these people, Sir, are shocked and really disgusted at the suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  if a man votes \"no\", the law says it is \"yes\". Those are the people,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwho for months and months have been defending the P.A.P. to me, and at last they\r\n\r\nare  stunned  into silence - not that it gives me pleasure, Sir,  because  amongst\r\n\r\nthem  are those who are very close to me, amongst them are those who are my very\r\n\r\ngood friends.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no way to say \"no\". If you cast a blank vote, it is a Government\r\n\r\nvote. You try defacing the paper - Mr Speaker, Sir, if you deface the paper, you know you will go to gaol\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  you know also that for several years you will have no right to vote  or  to\r\n\r\nstand  for  election. The Prime Minister has a brainwave.  He  says,  \"Tell  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  mark  their  preference, and to  sign  their  names  and  put  their\r\n\r\naddresses.  Then  it  will count at least as a blank.\" How  good  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister! Sir, the Prime Minister knows, first and foremost, that there are many\r\n\r\nwho  are unfortunately still illiterate in Singapore. That is why we provide our\r\n\r\nballot  papers  with  symbols, the way we do. But there is something  much  more\r\n\r\nimportant  than  the  fact that the illiterate will not be  able  to  vote.  The\r\n\r\nserious  objection is that those who seek at least to salve their conscience  by\r\n\r\ncasting  a  blank vote are required to violate the basic principle of democratic\r\n\r\nvoting,  and  that is the secrecy of the vote. The Prime Minister, in  order  to\r\n\r\nenable  a  man to cast a blank or void vote, requires him to transgress  and  to\r\n\r\ndestroy, or he himself destroys, the principle of the secret vote. It seems that\r\n\r\nthe man, who at least does not want to say \"yes\" to either proposition, must, in\r\n\r\norder  to  salve his conscience, deprive himself of the right to a secret  vote.\r\n\r\nThat  is  P.A.P. democracy. He must give his name and address to the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nlay himself open to what may well follow.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final act of perfidy - though \"final\" is the wrong term in the context\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P., there will only be a final act of perfidy when they are well and\r\n\r\ntruly  buried  politically (this corpse that stinks still stands up) - they  ask,\r\n\r\nSir, that the number of those votes which have been cast blank shall be added to\r\n\r\nthe  Government votes. The people know that these will count for the  Government\r\n\r\nbecause they do not know how to put in a \"no\", and they do not know how at least\r\n\r\nto  put in a blank or a void paper, and so cast a blank one. And not only  that,\r\n\r\nSir,  but  that  these shall be surreptitiously added to the  Government  votes.\r\n\r\nThose  who vote \"yes\" for Command Paper 33 and those who do not want Command  Paper  33 are to be added up together. And the P.A.P. Government will publish  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers,  and  the Straits Times will come out  with  banner  headlines,\r\n\r\n\"P.A.P. Victory. 100 per cent for\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nMerger\". For, Sir, they have shamelessly, and with the assistance of the S.P.A.,\r\n\r\nrejected  the  provision which would have enabled at least an identification  of\r\n\r\nthe  number of blank votes. Even if legally you want to deem them to  be  \"yes\",\r\n\r\nand even if legally you want to give a value to zero, let us know the number  of\r\n\r\nzeros.\r\n\r\nEven that, we are not to have the solace, Sir.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this may seem a minor point to you but it is such a breach of the rule of\r\n\r\nlaw that though it may not seem serious to others, to me it is important, and  I\r\n\r\nask your indulgence if I refer to\r\n\r\nit.  If a man brings a referendum petition, the Judge will be required by law to\r\n\r\nread secret memoranda prepared by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and  its  police  and Special Branch  personnel  of  which  the\r\n\r\npetitioner is not to be allowed to know anything at all. And the Judge will have\r\n\r\nto read memoranda if submitted by Ministers and by their henchmen. And the Judge\r\n\r\nwill  have  to take them into consideration without letting the petitioner  know\r\n\r\nwhat  is  in  them or enabling him to rebut them; because the law  prevents  the\r\n\r\nJudge  from  exercising  a  judicial discretion  which,  in  justice,  he  would\r\n\r\notherwise do.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill marks the turning point in the history of the attempts that we\r\n\r\nhave  made  to  introduce the parliamentary democratic system in Singapore.  For\r\n\r\nseven  years I have been railed at, I have been abused, and I have at times  wondered  why  I was submitting to the tortures which only masochists would  enjoy.\r\n\r\nSir, whether it is believed or not.\r\n\r\nI tell you it is my firm conviction that\r\n\r\nour people, who it is true have never had any traditions of democracy, could  be\r\n\r\nimbued  with an understanding and a respect for what is patently the  healthiest\r\n\r\nform  of  government evolved by the mind of man. Our people are young; they  are\r\n\r\nvital.  They  are  different from others, Sir, I do  say  with  respect  and  no\r\n\r\narrogance  here,  that if you go to other countries and travel round,  when  you\r\n\r\ncome  back  to  Singapore you will feel reinvigorated once you meet  the  people\r\n\r\nhere.

Government, through all these months of discussion, is  unacceptable  to\r\n\r\nhim. In the next column there will be a second proposal which, on the face of it - and  this  has been mentioned in the Prime Minister's proposed  motion  to  be\r\n\r\nbrought  up  in  the  next  few  days - after  its  exposure,  will  also   appear\r\n\r\nunacceptable, or even more unacceptable than the first proposal,  which  is  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper proposal.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have only 14 days between the date of the\r\n\r\nannouncement of the referendum and polling day; 14 days is hardly sufficient  to\r\n\r\nexplain  what  the  two proposals mean. Then we will only  have  seven  days  to\r\n\r\nexplain to the voters what the symbols mean. Sir, the voter will go to the  polling  booth and in front of him will be a ballot paper. What is he going to  do?\r\n\r\nHe  does not want to vote for the White Paper. Neither does he want to vote  for\r\n\r\nthe second proposal. And there will be four choices open to him. Firstly, he can\r\n\r\nabstain  from going to vote; and the Member for Anson has said just now that  he\r\n\r\nwill  be fined $5 and he will lose the right to vote in coming elections. If  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  abstain from going to the polling booth, he can write  his  name  and\r\n\r\naddress and the vote will be considered a void vote. Or else he can tear off the\r\n\r\nballot paper, or he can cast a blank vote. There are three alternatives open  to\r\n\r\nhim  - write his name and address; tear off the ballot paper or cast a blank\r\n\r\nvote. Let us analyse the consequences of each way.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he writes his name and address;\r\n\r\nthose who can write their names and addresses would be afraid of being called up\r\n\r\nby the Government and have to take all the consequences.

This referendum  should  be  an\r\n\r\nhonest  one which will reflect the real and true wishes of the people; in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  to ascertain the wishes of the majority of the people. We do not want  a\r\n\r\ndishonest  and  a sham referendum. But under the present Bill as it  stands,  we\r\n\r\nwill  not  have  an  honest referendum. The result, as I said  yesterday,  is  a\r\n\r\nforegone conclusion. We can expect that in the coming referendum, the Government\r\n\r\nwill  win  perhaps  with a 99 per cent landslide victory for their  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, in these circumstances, is it really necessary for the Government to\r\n\r\nput  forward this facade of democracy?

The 1962 referendum held in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be the subject of much research in subsequent history,  so  that\r\n\r\nstudents  of  history,  political science and the art of political  manipulation\r\n\r\nwill  have  much  to  learn from the 1962 referendum held in  Singapore.

Those who have said so include the Chairman of the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nits  Prime  Minister, and others. The Chairman of the P.A.P. said  sometime  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  last year, in reply to queries from three leaders of the  Opposition,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  Chairman  of the Barisan Sosialis, those of  the  U.P.P. and  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party,  that  arrangements between the Singapore  and  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernments  had  been made and that they wanted to find  out  from  the  people\r\n\r\nwhether  these were acceptable or not. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, even  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister himself said - and he said this on the 25th of September last year  over\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore in a Press conference - something to this effect:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the National Referendum there will be about 650,000 of the electorate -'\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

It was on the 25th of  September.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time he said that if the people wanted merger, they could mark a cross  in\r\n\r\nthe  square  for yes; and if they did not, then they could put a  cross  in  the\r\n\r\nsquare  for  no.  The Prime Minister even said at the Teachers' Day  celebration\r\n\r\nthat  the  merger plan would be given to the people for a decision.  There  were\r\n\r\nmany  others  who said so, and I do not wish to take up too much  time  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly to make quotations. However, as sincere leaders in the Government, they\r\n\r\nshould carry out what they have promised. They should not deviate from what they\r\n\r\nhave  promised.  But unfortunately, the P.A.P. leaders before  us  have  already\r\n\r\nforgotten entirely the promises they made in the past. In fact, they are  trying\r\n\r\nto  pay  a  very  unfair game in order to change their promises. Now  they  have\r\n\r\nturned  round to say that they will find out from the people what type of merger\r\n\r\nthey want. The mode and manner of merger is actually Cmd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaper  33  of this Assembly. The people of Singapore know full well the contents\r\n\r\nof  this White Paper. They also know that the White Paper on merger is going  to\r\n\r\nbe  detrimental  to  the future of the people. It is not going  to  provide  any\r\n\r\nsafeguard  for the rights of the people in Singapore. According to the intention\r\n\r\nof  the  Government, it seems that another type of merger will  be  put  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  for  a decision. What is the content of this other type of merger?  What\r\n\r\nwill  be its provisions? Not only do the people of Singapore not know, but  even\r\n\r\nthe  people in this House do not know what type of merger is to be put. We  have\r\n\r\nnot  received  any report on the other type of merger. If after the  passage  of\r\n\r\nthis   National  Referendum  Bill,  the  Government  should  hold  a  referendum\r\n\r\nimmediately,  then  the Government can pose two questions.  The  first  question\r\n\r\ncould  be  the White Paper on merger. The second question could be the  type  of\r\n\r\nmerger whose contents the people of Singapore do not know. So when this question\r\n\r\nshould  be  put  before the people, how are they going to make a choice?  So  in\r\n\r\ntheir  rage the people have no alternative but to put in blank votes or to  draw\r\n\r\ntortoises, birds and other signs on the ballot papers. According to clause 29 of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  blank votes and votes that contain indecent signs and  other  marks\r\n\r\nwill  be  taken as votes in support of the Government. So on a matter  that  concerns  the  entire interests of the people, the Government is trying to  mislead\r\n\r\nthe  people  by this National Referendum Bill and to ignore the true wishes  and\r\n\r\nwill of the people. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill has been drafted with  unconstitutional principles on a very illegal basis. The true spirit of this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  to  indulge in illegitimate means, and if we should allow this Bill to pass,\r\n\r\nthen that will mean that it is against the principle of the basic constitutional\r\n\r\nspirit  and  it  will  be  criticised by the world. As a representative  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, it is my duty to see that democracy is safeguarded to show that the true\r\n\r\nspirit of democracy is not damaged by the pseudo democrats. Not only do we  want\r\n\r\nto show the pseudo democrats for what they are, but we also want to see that the\r\n\r\nbasic rights of the people are secured\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nin  order that every man in Singapore will be able to express his own will in a\r\n\r\nconstitutional  matter. But before us today, there appear some  P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nwho  attempt  to  undermine democracy and the rights of the people.  This  they\r\n\r\nwant  to do by the National Referendum Bill. When this Bill came up for  Second\r\n\r\nReading,  the  Minister for Home Affairs tried to make amendments  thereto  and\r\n\r\ntried  to  include certain undemocratic clauses. So when this Bill was  up  for\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading,  almost  every  Member in the Opposition,  together  with  the\r\n\r\npeople,  showed their dissatisfaction with all these clauses. They exposed  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the P.A.P. was trying to have a dishonest victory in the referendum\r\n\r\non  merger.  They would not allow the people to have a chance to say  'no'.  In\r\n\r\nthe  course of the heated debate, it was suggested that the Bill should be  committed  to  a  Select Committee. Representations and memoranda  came  from  the\r\n\r\npeople's  organisations,  such  as  the organisation  of  hawkers  -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

In Select  Committee, the Government maintained its obstinacy and refused to respect the views of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  The  Government did not even consider the  amendments  which  were\r\n\r\nreasonable and which were moved by the Barisan Sosialis. We spent a lot of  time\r\n\r\nin Select Committee discussing this Bill, and that was the treatment we got.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before the Third Reading of this Bill is passed and\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  thereby becoming law, we will then have the responsibility to  oppose\r\n\r\nits  Third  Reading, because it is the basic intention of this Bill to  encroach\r\n\r\nupon the basic rights of the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere in the world can we find such provisions as those contained in this\r\n\r\nBill put forward by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 5 of the Bill\r\n\r\nsays that the Government can pose two questions to the people for a decision and\r\n\r\nthat the people must choose one of these two questions; the people will have  no\r\n\r\nright  to say no. This provision is trying to force the people to accept one  of\r\n\r\ntwo  questions  which are equally unacceptable; that is to  say,  the  provision\r\n\r\nwants to force the people to do things which are detrimental to their future. So\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, this compulsory provision in this Bill has encroached upon the\r\n\r\nbasic rights of the people to make a choice.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 29 regarding blank votes provides that blank votes\r\n\r\nwill  be  taken  as  votes in support of the Government. Why should  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  provide that blank votes should be deemed to be votes in support  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government? This is because of the provision in clause 5 which  will  allow\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to pose two unacceptable questions to the people  and,  on  the\r\n\r\nother hand, disallow them to say no.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The fact remains that\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nclause  29  is in the Bill, and all that the Member can say now is  that  it  is\r\n\r\nprobably  inappropriate for this referendum on merger. I do not want the  merits\r\n\r\nof the clause to be debated again.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, there are some important points in the provision. What I have said\r\n\r\njust now is most important. This provision is very ambiguous, and the Government\r\n\r\nmay  make  use of it to cheat the people. Therefore, I am here to reiterate  the\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will realise that blank votes mean that the people give\r\n\r\nup  their rights. It means the people who abstain. If we look around the  world,\r\n\r\nwhatever the government may be, whether it is a party or any organisation, blank\r\n\r\nvotes mean abstention. They can never be considered as votes in support of-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is now arguing against clause 29.\r\n\r\nHe cannot do that. We have finished\r\n\r\narguing against clause 29. We are on the Third Reading. We are not in Committee.\r\n\r\nHe  must accept the fact that clause 29 is part of the Bill. All he can  say  is\r\n\r\nthat  clause 29 is not an appropriate clause for the purpose of a referendum  on\r\n\r\nmerger between Singapore and the Federation. There are several arguments he  can\r\n\r\nadvance. I could suggest them, but I will let him do it himself.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I am explaining the point that this Bill is undemocratic and  that\r\n\r\nit cannot be passed for the Third Reading because it cannot ascertain the wishes\r\n\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already pointed out that the Bill cheats. It is also\r\n\r\nfull  of  ridiculous provisions and intimidation. The intimidating provision  is\r\n\r\nbarbarious  and  it is regulated by the Government. When this  Bill  becomes  an\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  the people have no choice at all. If they do not want to vote,  then\r\n\r\nthere is Provision in the Bill to intimidate the people, saying that there  will\r\n\r\nbe a fine imposed on them and they\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  deprived of their citizenship. If the people are confronted with  this\r\n\r\nrestriction,  they may get so angry that they may deface, tear  or  destroy  the\r\n\r\nballot  paper. Then according to this Bill they will have committed an  offence.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  people  deface their own ballot papers, it is just  like  the  people\r\n\r\ntearing  their  own  money. Yet there is provision in the Bill  to  deprive  the\r\n\r\npeople of their own rights. They will be subject to imprisonment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. He must accept\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  now part of the Bill. The hon. Member must learn to  accept  these\r\n\r\nthings.  Now  we  are debating whether or not these clauses are  appropriate  or\r\n\r\nadequate for the purpose of this referendum. That is all we are arguing.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the\r\n\r\nBill is to launch a merger between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nOn a point of order.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member has been repeating his words.

The space in the\r\n\r\nPress  has nothing to do with the Third Reading of this Bill. As I  say,  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member must accept that clauses have been written into this  Bill.  Now\r\n\r\nhe  must  show  that  these  clauses or certain  of  these  clauses  are  not\r\n\r\nappropriate  or  adequate for the purpose of a referendum on  merger  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation.
