At  the\r\n\r\nadministrative level, this belief has been translated  into  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  procurement policy and implemented  by  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinistry all these years and,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat is, in any public open tender, the bids must be competitive\r\n\r\nand the award goes to the lowest bid with substantial compliance\r\n\r\nwith the specifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have studied economics, this procurement\r\n\r\npolicy can be said to meet the requirements for optimum consumer\r\n\r\nand   producer  benefits  based  on  the  assumptions  that  the\r\n\r\nfollowing conditions are met:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There must be a large number of competitors;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The competitors are about the same size;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The competitors are provided with the same information;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The competitors will have the same product quality; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Free entry and free exit for all competitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one or more of these conditions are not satisfied, the\r\n\r\noutcome  may  not  be  optimum.  The  interference  by  TAS  was\r\n\r\nactually trying to make sure that all these conditions are  met.\r\n\r\nHowever, in other segments of the economy, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry where most of the development  funds  will\r\n\r\nbe  spent,  I  observe  that the players repeatedly  deviate  or\r\n\r\nattempt to deviate from these conditions for their own benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to declare my interest here. One typical\r\n\r\nexample of violating free entry conditions is the process of pre-qualification  where unreasonable conditions are set  to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  competitors.   Another  example  would  be  the\r\n\r\npredatory  pricing  policy  practised  by  almost  all   foreign\r\n\r\ncontractors.  The table distributed earlier shows that six local\r\n\r\nconstruction companies with a turnover of $6.6 billion  reported\r\n\r\na  profit  of  2.8% and paid a tax of 1%, that is, $46  million.\r\n\r\nBut  seven  Japanese companies with a turnover of $6.1  billion,\r\n\r\nwhich is almost the same as the local companies, reported a loss\r\n\r\nof  $201  million and paid a tax of 0.4%, that is, $24  million.\r\n\r\nWhat is worse is that three Korean companies with a turnover  of\r\n\r\n$4.6  billion reported a loss of $300 million and paid a tax  of\r\n\r\n$14,869.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOne Chinese company and one French company also reported losses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, anyone who reads this report, which is extracted from\r\n\r\nour  ROC,  will straightaway recognise that all these firms  are\r\n\r\neither  poorly managed, or they carry out dumping, or  they  are\r\n\r\npractising  transfer  pricing, or doing  a  combination  of  the\r\n\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Finance Minister whether it is his\r\n\r\npolicy  to  allow this to happen.  I wish to highlight  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse that dumping and transfer pricing are predatory in nature.\r\n\r\nIt  helps these firms to increase their ability to grab projects\r\n\r\nat  all  times,  and thereby crowding out the  local  firms  who\r\n\r\nhonestly price the projects and pay their taxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to raise the question why these foreign\r\n\r\nfirms  could sustain huge losses year after year.  Do they still\r\n\r\nmeet  our  CIDB's  registration requirement?  And  if  they  are\r\n\r\nbranch  offices,  is their head office still  a  viable  entity?\r\n\r\nSir, let me look at this issue from another angle.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  bring up a point made by the Finance Minister two days  ago.\r\n\r\nIn  his reply to Mr Lim Swee Say, he mentioned that at our stage\r\n\r\nof  development,  he  would  like  to  have  more  aesthetically\r\n\r\ndesigned buildings and these buildings should also be built  for\r\n\r\neasy  maintenance.  He has in fact brought home the  point  that\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry  believes in paying for good value,  and  not  the\r\n\r\ncheapest.  Hence, again, I agree with Mr Lim that we should save\r\n\r\nbut we should go further by stretching our dollar to the fullest\r\n\r\nfrom  the present and future benefits.  And that is to  say,  in\r\n\r\nfinancial  terms,  the price we are paying  should  be  the  net\r\n\r\npresent  value  of present and future benefits.  Aesthetics,  as\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Minister, can be classified as present  benefit\r\n\r\nand ease of maintenance is of course our future benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to urge that the Finance Ministry build into the\r\n\r\nprocurement  system  more  measures to  incorporate  some  other\r\n\r\nbenefits and these benefits can assist SMEs to build capability,\r\n\r\njust like our previous policy on CONQUAS;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  create  jobs;  to  acquire and retain  knowledge;  to  build\r\n\r\ncommunity bonding and to be environmentally friendly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many members of this House have brought up this issue in\r\n\r\nthe first two days.  Here, I am suggesting a mechanism where all\r\n\r\nwishes can be fulfilled and yet we still get the most benefit of\r\n\r\nan  open  and fair market.  By not sticking to the lowest  price\r\n\r\nmethod,  we  can  adopt the bidding model based  on  performance\r\n\r\nspecifications  or the design-and-build specifications  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe WTO requirements and to get the most benefit.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Chuang, could you wind up because\r\n\r\nwe  need  to allow time for the Minister to reply to about  nine\r\n\r\nMembers?  If you use up all the time, I am afraid there will  be\r\n\r\nno more time for reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Yes, Sir. I hope the Minister can see\r\n\r\nthat  there is a need to change our mindset and again I want  to\r\n\r\nask,  in  line with the call by Mr Lim Swee Say, that we  change\r\n\r\nthe  mindset of our people.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock has called on the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to care for the people, in the light of our  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent policy.  I would also like to echo his call by asking the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  care  for  the  SMEs  in  the  light  of  unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition from overseas.  With Government accounting for  more\r\n\r\nthan 50 cents for each dollar spent in Singapore, the Government\r\n\r\ncan  show  that it cares by changing its mindset,  that  is,  it\r\n\r\nshould be left to market forces.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I will respond to questions\r\n\r\nraised  yesterday, beginning with Mr Lim Swee Say.  Mr  Lim  has\r\n\r\nasked  whether Government could consider granting pioneer status\r\n\r\nor   special  investment  allowances  to  companies  which   are\r\n\r\nproceeding to move into the knowledge-based industries, as  this\r\n\r\nis  the future we envisage for our country.  I can assure Mr Lim\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government recognises the need to transform Singapore\r\n\r\ninto a knowledge-based economy so that we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave been constantly revising our incentives to try to meet  new\r\n\r\nrequirements.  For example, in the 1998 Budget, I  have  already\r\n\r\nannounced   an  Approved  Cyber  Trading  incentive  scheme   to\r\n\r\nencourage  companies  to  take advantage  of  trading  over  the\r\n\r\nInternet and several other existing tax incentives, such as  the\r\n\r\npioneer  status, the Development Expansion incentive and  double\r\n\r\ntax  deductions for research and development, already  cater  to\r\n\r\ncompanies  engaged in high-value activities in  high  technology\r\n\r\nprojects  which  should  also  cover  the  knowledge-based  type\r\n\r\nindustries.   Indicators  such as value-added  per  worker,  the\r\n\r\nprofile of the workers and the level of research and development\r\n\r\nspending are already currently being used to evaluate the awards\r\n\r\nof these incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I should point out that to achieve what we aim to do,\r\n\r\nthe  tax incentives granted must be focused.  Otherwise, we will\r\n\r\nbe  giving  away money without any specific objective  in  mind.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  if  we simply give tax incentives  for  whichever\r\n\r\ncompany  claims  to be investing in manpower redevelopment,  the\r\n\r\ndispensation of such tax advantages would be too broad  to  have\r\n\r\nany direct focus or desired outcome.  However, agencies such  as\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Development Board can leverage on the granting  of\r\n\r\ntax  incentives  to  get  companies to  upgrade  their  manpower\r\n\r\ncapabilities  and  my Ministry is also always open  to  consider\r\n\r\nspecific  proposals  to  incentivise  manpower  development  and\r\n\r\nupgrading  and  I would ask Mr Lim to let us have  his  specific\r\n\r\nviews  which we will consider.  I can assure him that they  will\r\n\r\nbe  well-received.   But we need to know  specifically  what  is\r\n\r\nneeded,  and in which directions should we give these incentives\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  obviously not possible to try  and  give  broad\r\n\r\nincentives  covering all sectors because that will  be  far  too\r\n\r\ncostly.   As Mr Lim himself has said, there are already referral\r\n\r\nschemes   by   Government  to  facilitate  and  fund  continuous\r\n\r\nlearning,  but  more  can  be done if this  is  necessary.   The\r\n\r\nManpower  21  Committee is also looking  into  ways  to  promote\r\n\r\nlifelong learning and upgrading in our workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has raised the issue of helping our local\r\n\r\ntraders grow by providing trade financing.  He is quite right in\r\n\r\nsaying that small traders form an important part of our economy,\r\n\r\nand, therefore we should try and help them whenever we can,  and\r\n\r\nmany of these had been hit by the present downturn.  However, he\r\n\r\nhas suggested that Government should provide financing along the\r\n\r\nlines  of the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS) for trading\r\n\r\nactivities.  Alternatively, Government should arrange for  local\r\n\r\nbanks or international banks to provide low-cost loans for  such\r\n\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that the commercial market for trade\r\n\r\nfinancing  in  Singapore  is  already  very  well-developed  and\r\n\r\nefficient, since trading has been a long established part of our\r\n\r\neconomy  and our entire banking infrastructure is geared  up  to\r\n\r\nservice  this  sector.   As such, I do  not  see  there  is  any\r\n\r\ncompelling reason why Government should intervene and extend the\r\n\r\nLEFS  scheme into the trading sector.  But if he can  put  up  a\r\n\r\nspecific proposal, we would welcome it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also indicated that Hong Kong\r\n\r\nprovides tax exemption for third country trade done outside  the\r\n\r\neconomy by a company in Hong Kong.  I should point out that Hong\r\n\r\nKong  has a different tax rule from Singapore.  Such income will\r\n\r\nbe  regarded as a foreign source income and therefore not  taxed\r\n\r\nin  Hong  Kong.  In the case of Singapore, such income would  be\r\n\r\ntaxed  if  it is carried out by a company in Singapore  as  this\r\n\r\nwould  be  regarded  as Singapore source  income.   However,  to\r\n\r\npromote  offshore  trading,  we have  introduced  tax  incentive\r\n\r\nschemes  such as Approved Oil Traders and Approved International\r\n\r\nTraders  Schemes.   Under these schemes,  income  from  offshore\r\n\r\ntrades  carried  out  by  approved  traders  are  taxed   at   a\r\n\r\nconcessionary  rate  of  10%.  These schemes  are  open  to  all\r\n\r\ncompanies,  whether local or foreign, as long as they  meet  the\r\n\r\napproval criteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai has asked for a review of the tax on the\r\n\r\nsale  of  property.  Tax rules were changed in  May  1996  as  a\r\n\r\nmeasure to dampen property speculation.  The key\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchange  was to impose capital gains tax on property sold  within\r\n\r\nthree  years.   At  this point of time, we do not  think  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to remove this restriction because genuine home buyers\r\n\r\nshould not be disturbed by this requirement.  They ought not  to\r\n\r\nbe  selling their property within three years. In any case,  the\r\n\r\ntax  is on a sliding scale.  What we are concerned about is,  if\r\n\r\nthis measure is lifted now, and the property sector recovers, we\r\n\r\nwill  be faced with the same problem again and will have to  re-introduce a new set of regulations.  For the time being, I would\r\n\r\nprefer to leave it be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has raised concern over the administration\r\n\r\nof  GST,  particularly  in the cashflow problems  faced  by  the\r\n\r\nsmaller  companies and she has asked that the  Government  could\r\n\r\nperhaps streamline these procedures to help them.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  say that the Government has already several schemes to  help\r\n\r\nease  the  cashflow  burden of these businesses,  including  the\r\n\r\nSMEs,  and these include the Major Exporters Scheme, the  Bonded\r\n\r\nWarehouse  Scheme and companies with MES status could  have  GST\r\n\r\nsuspended  on  imports.   In  my  FY99  Budget  speech,  I  also\r\n\r\nannounced  two  new  schemes to help contract manufacturers  and\r\n\r\ntraders who are operating as logistics companies.  I do not want\r\n\r\nto spend any more time on this issue because my time is limited.\r\n\r\nBut  if  Mrs  Lim  is interested, I can provide  her  with  more\r\n\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has raised questions on whether we should\r\n\r\nnot be amending the Companies Act as a comprehensive overhaul of\r\n\r\nthe Companies Act is long overdue.  I agree with Mr Sin that the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act  has to be amended regularly to ensure  that  its\r\n\r\nambit  does  not fall behind comparable jurisdictions elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn  particular, it should be updated to ensure the provisions do\r\n\r\nnot  inhibit  or  place obstacles in the path  of  new  economic\r\n\r\nactivities.   This is especially important at the  present  time\r\n\r\nwhen  we  are  trying  to  restructure rapidly  to  a  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin has also suggested that we scrutinize changes made\r\n\r\nin other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountries such as Australia.  We will indeed be looking  at  all\r\n\r\nthe  new schemes which other jurisdictions have proposed to help\r\n\r\nsmaller  companies and we will incorporate whatever we  consider\r\n\r\nappropriate.  Instead of embarking on a comprehensive review  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act, it is more prudent and practical to progress in stages\r\n\r\nto  improve  the Act and to introduce changes which  are  needed\r\n\r\nurgently,  rather than try to do a comprehensive review  all  at\r\n\r\nonce  as this will take quite a long time.  Otherwise, the total\r\n\r\noverhaul  of the Act  at this time will hold back other  changes\r\n\r\nunnecessarily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also raised questions with regard to\r\n\r\nchanges in our tax laws.  He said that our current tax laws  are\r\n\r\ntoo  restrictive and inflexible.  Mr Heng Chiang  Meng,  in  his\r\n\r\nBudget  debate speech, also called for a full review of our  tax\r\n\r\nsystem  to  ensure  that  it  is totally  business-friendly  and\r\n\r\nsupportive  of the economy's broad goals.  I can understand  why\r\n\r\nMr Inderjit Singh and Mr Heng are being deliberately provocative\r\n\r\nin  making  these  appeals.  Clearly, in these difficult  times,\r\n\r\nthey  want as much help as possible for our companies,  which  I\r\n\r\nthink  is  very  laudable.   But I  hope  that  they  will  also\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the Ministry of Finance, in responding  to  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of businesses, has also to cater to the needs of a  wider\r\n\r\nconstituency  which  is  to safeguard  the  Government's  fiscal\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help businesses, we can cut taxes, increase rebates and relax\r\n\r\nour regulations.  But there is a point beyond which we cannot go\r\n\r\nwithout  fore-going  too much revenue and  allow  too  much  tax\r\n\r\nleakage,  leading  to permanent budget deficits.   Striking  the\r\n\r\ncorrect balance is not an easy process but I believe that up  to\r\n\r\nnow, we have not done too bad a job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that we look at our tax system in totality\r\n\r\nwhen making comparisons with tax systems elsewhere.  One has  to\r\n\r\nlook   at  the  overall  effective  tax  burden  on  businesses,\r\n\r\ndetermine  the  competitiveness of our tax regime,  rather  than\r\n\r\ncomparing a particular feature in a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntax system with another.  Compared to many countries, we have  a\r\n\r\nsimple  tax  system  which is not onerous  in  compliance.   Our\r\n\r\nincome  tax rates are low.  We do not tax foreign source  income\r\n\r\nuntil  it is remitted.  We do not have a capital gains tax  such\r\n\r\nas  in  countries like the United Kingdom and the United  States\r\n\r\nand  we allow full imputation for corporate tax.  This has  made\r\n\r\nour  effective  corporate  tax  burden  low  compared  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to stress that the Ministry of Finance and the IRAS\r\n\r\nreview  our  tax structure regularly with the changing  business\r\n\r\nenvironment  and aims to achieve a tax regime that is  conducive\r\n\r\nand  friendly to business.  This is our main aim and if  Members\r\n\r\nhave constructive ideas, these will be always welcome subject to\r\n\r\nthe  caveats I have stated earlier.  Any changes we make are not\r\n\r\ndone  in  isolation but always in consultation with our economic\r\n\r\nagencies and frequently with feedback from the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also puts forward seven specific proposals in\r\n\r\ngreat detail.  I am afraid that I do not have time to deal  with\r\n\r\nthese  in full and I suggest that I give him a written reply  so\r\n\r\nthat he at least gets a proper response.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I think the House\r\n\r\nmust  be  grateful to the Minister for giving very comprehensive\r\n\r\nreplies.

Prices were then back to the level  of\r\n\r\nthe first quarter of 1995.  Since then, with the full impact  of\r\n\r\nthe  regional economic crisis felt, it is estimated that by  the\r\n\r\nend  of  last year, prices have corrected by about 40% from  the\r\n\r\npeak, and this has brought prices back to the 1993 levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a matter of grave concern to many. While deflating\r\n\r\nproperty  values  can  help  improve  Singapore's  international\r\n\r\ncompetitive  position, drastic asset price  correction  of  this\r\n\r\nscale can trigger negative multiplier effects on consumption and\r\n\r\ninvestment.  It also imposes an additional strain on the banking\r\n\r\nsector  as  many  credit lines are secured by  property  assets.\r\n\r\nCalls  for  top ups by banks and finance companies not  met  can\r\n\r\nlead  to  reduction in credit lines, defaulting loans, corporate\r\n\r\nfailures  and  personal bankruptcies.  The consequences  on  the\r\n\r\neconomy can be disastrous, as business failures can lead to mass\r\n\r\nunemployment and social unrest, as we have seen in Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, in my view, it is the duty of Government\r\n\r\nto  do its utmost to stabilise the property market.  Despite the\r\n\r\nactions  taken  by  the  Government so far,  such  as  deferring\r\n\r\nGovernment   land  sales  programmes,  extending   the   project\r\n\r\ncompletion period for Government land sale sites to eight  years\r\n\r\nand so on, according to the property consultants, the prices are\r\n\r\nstill  falling  against a backdrop of fewer transactions.   This\r\n\r\nproblem  is obviously a very complex one caused by the  regional\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis, poor sentiments, tight liquidity, over  supply\r\n\r\nof space and, of course, high land values.  It is just a problem\r\n\r\nof mismatch between the demand and supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to property consultants, on the supply side, the\r\n\r\neffective  potential  supply of residential  property  is  about\r\n\r\n30,000  units.  The average take up rate, however, is  estimated\r\n\r\nto  be only 6,000 units per annum.  This means it will take five\r\n\r\nyears, ie, until the year 2003, for the current potential supply\r\n\r\nof  30,000  units  to  be absorbed.  I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether he agrees with these estimates put up  by  the\r\n\r\nproperty  consultants and, if so, what are the implications  for\r\n\r\nthe  future  sale  of residential land.  Does it  mean  that  we\r\n\r\nshould defer land sales for a few more years beyond 1999?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the demand side, consultants have also estimated that by the\r\n\r\nyear  2000, effective total housing stock comprising both public\r\n\r\nand  private units will be 875,000 units, exceeding the  housing\r\n\r\nneeds  of 797,000 units by 9%.  So there will be an excess stock\r\n\r\nof  80,000 units.  Here again, I would like to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he agrees with these figures and, if so, what  are  the\r\n\r\nimplications for housing policy.  Would the Ministry review  the\r\n\r\ntotal  housing  supply in a comprehensive  manner,  taking  into\r\n\r\naccount  the demographics of Singapore and let us know  what  is\r\n\r\nthe long-term sustainable supply that should be planned for?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister whether he thinks all\r\n\r\nthe  measures  currently in place are enough  to  stabilise  the\r\n\r\nproperty  market,  and,  if not, what  new  measures  should  be\r\n\r\nintroduced.  Would the Government consider going into the market\r\n\r\nto buy back the surplus land at current market prices and return\r\n\r\nthem  to  the  State land bank, or perhaps put them  into  other\r\n\r\nalternative uses?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion I made at the debate on the Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  but  which was not given a specific response  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance is the possible waiver of stamp duty  paid\r\n\r\nby  the purchaser until further notice.  Would the Minister look\r\n\r\ninto this proposal also?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee (West Coast):</b> Sir, I listened with great\r\n\r\ninterest what my GPC Chairman has said.  I totally disagree with\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1992 and 1996, property prices increased by well over\r\n\r\n300%.   This  had  brought about a lot of  undesirable  effects.\r\n\r\nOwning  a  private  residential property for most  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nbecame  an  impossible dream.  Our business costs also escalated\r\n\r\nand  we  became  uncompetitive.  Our efforts to attract  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents  to  Singapore were also hampered, because the  cost  of\r\n\r\nhousing  had become a very serious stumbling block.   After  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the  anti-speculation measures  in  May  1996,\r\n\r\ncoupled  with  the severe regional economic crisis,  prices  had\r\n\r\ndeclined.  But the prices are still relatively high compared  to\r\n\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property market has a tremendous impact on the economic\r\n\r\nperformance  of  the  country.  It has to be  properly  managed.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  would  like  to urge the  Government  to  closely\r\n\r\nmonitor  the sale  of land.  As we know, the supply of  property\r\n\r\nis  inelastic, given the gestation period necessary to bring the\r\n\r\nsupply  to  the  market.  I am concerned that if the  freeze  in\r\n\r\nGovernment land sale is continued for too long, it might  result\r\n\r\nin  a shortfall when demand picks up.  This can lead to a repeat\r\n\r\nof the boom and bust cycle that is economically unproductive.  I\r\n\r\ntherefore urge the Government not to delay the sale of land  for\r\n\r\ntoo long, in order to maintain greater stability in the property\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, owning a private property is a very\r\n\r\ndesirable  ambition, and I think we should  encourage  it.   The\r\n\r\nonly  caveat is that in this country, the property market is  so\r\n\r\nvolatile.   If  we  take  1981 as a base,  a  terrace  house  in\r\n\r\nSerangoon/Hougang  used to cost $40,000.   Ten  years  later  in\r\n\r\n1991, it was $400,000,  10 times.  Nowhere in the world could we\r\n\r\nhave such a high appreciation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here this morning's Business Times. Let me quote Mr\r\n\r\nGreenspan.  He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Based on a medium period of owning a home for nine years, that\r\n\r\neach home sale since 1995 has averaged roughly US$35,000.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHere,  in  the height of the property speculation, the next  day\r\n\r\nyou can make $35,000.  This is dangerous and we should check it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some proposals for the Minister. There has been\r\n\r\nsome  success  with Executive Condominiums.  The Government,  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment,  is the biggest owner of land, and I  am  concerned\r\n\r\nespecially  with  99-year  leasehold properties.   The  cost  of\r\n\r\nconstruction does not rise and fall very much.  It is almost  at\r\n\r\na very level position.  What the Government can help to make the\r\n\r\ndream  become a reality is this - sell the land or possibly  the\r\n\r\nHDB  could join forces with the private developers, and then  at\r\n\r\nleast you have some control over the market forces.  I know  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will say that we should not interfere with the  market\r\n\r\nsentiment.  But this is one suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is this perception in some Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat we must buy a private home within 5-10 years.  I think this\r\n\r\nperception  has  to change with the economic  reality.   I  must\r\n\r\nespecially applaud the Ministry, and the HDB in particular,  for\r\n\r\nbuilding very good housing.  I have been to other parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld,  both  developed and developing, but I think our  housing\r\n\r\npolicy  has  been a resounding success.  Can we improve  on  it?\r\n\r\nThat is the question.  And if the HDB can carve out some of  its\r\n\r\nolder  5-room  and  HUDC blocks, build some swimming  pools  and\r\n\r\nother  facilities, upgrade them into a real condominium, I think\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans will then stick with these flats  for  a  few\r\n\r\nyears and then move on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My plea to the Minister, and in fairness to the other\r\n\r\nMembers,  is  this.  Watch the market and then have a  long-term\r\n\r\nplanning.   Do not act on short-term measures.  Take a long-term\r\n\r\nplanning.  After all, land is limited in Singapore.  And I share\r\n\r\nthe  sentiments of what Dr Wan Soon Bee has said  earlier.   The\r\n\r\nproperty prices should not be too volatile.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in land scarce\r\n\r\nSingapore,  land  will  always be costly if  sustained  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth continues to generate a high demand for land.  That is  a\r\n\r\nfact that we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave to live with.  Having said that, it is important to examine\r\n\r\nwhether  there are other factors which contribute  to  the  high\r\n\r\ncost of land and, if so, what can be done about it.  Mr Lew  Syn\r\n\r\nPau  and  Dr  Wan Soon Bee spoke about land sales and disagreed.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to speak about would be policy changes on  the\r\n\r\ndemand side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that there was a property bubble which started\r\n\r\nfrom  about  the beginning of 1992 when there was a  discernible\r\n\r\nescalation in property prices.  From the first quarter  of  1992\r\n\r\nto  the  second  quarter  of  1996,  when  the  anti-speculation\r\n\r\nmeasures  were  imposed, the residential  property  price  index\r\n\r\nincreased  by about 160%.  What this meant was that  a  property\r\n\r\nwhich  costs  about  $1  million in 1992 would  have  cost  $2.6\r\n\r\nmillion, some four years later.  On hindsight, the May 1996 anti-speculation  measures, by curbing the sky-rocketing of  property\r\n\r\nprices,  also  helped prevent an even steeper  drop  during  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis which began to seriously affect  Singapore  in\r\n\r\nearly 1998.  That same piece of property which cost $2.6 million\r\n\r\nin 1996 would have cost $1.4 million at the end of 1998.  And  I\r\n\r\nthink  that what three of the MPs before me have been saying  is\r\n\r\nthat  this  kind of up and down movement in property  prices  is\r\n\r\nundesirable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason for the property bubble was the expectational\r\n\r\nspiral.   When  prices started rising, the expectation  of  even\r\n\r\nhigher  prices  in future spurred demand, which in  turn  caused\r\n\r\nprices  to increase in an ever increasing upward spiral.  During\r\n\r\nthat period, property was seen as a one way street to increasing\r\n\r\nwealth,  much  faster  than  earning  a  salary.  However,   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis has taught us otherwise, and I  hope  that  we\r\n\r\nlearn this very important lesson that investment in property has\r\n\r\nits risks and property prices can fall as well as rise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, expectation was not the only cause. Changes in\r\n\r\nGovernment  policy  which were implemented  to  achieve  certain\r\n\r\nspecific objectives, such as home ownership, contributed to  the\r\n\r\nincrease in demand and hence the property price\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nescalation.  For example, the price of a 4-room HDB resale  flat\r\n\r\nrose  from about $96,000 in 1992 to over $260,000 in 1996. The\r\n\r\n<br><br>1996&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost  Review  Committee  identified  two  factors   which\r\n\r\ncontributed  to this price escalation:  (1)  the  relaxation  of\r\n\r\nmortgage  financing  rules  in  1993,  which  allowed  for  loan\r\n\r\nfinancing  to be granted up to 80% of current valuation  instead\r\n\r\nof the 1984 posted prices; and (2) the revised resale procedures\r\n\r\nto ease cash upfront problems which occurred in 1995.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, it would be advisable that account be taken of the\r\n\r\npossible  impact  on property prices before policy  changes  are\r\n\r\nmade.  The  property  price escalation has  another  undesirable\r\n\r\neffect.  There was a time when property development was the best\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  town.   Every  large  company  in  Singapore   was\r\n\r\nconsidering  property development even though its core  business\r\n\r\nwas  entirely  unrelated.  Although each company  should  decide\r\n\r\nwhat  is best for its bottom line, I question whether, from  the\r\n\r\nnational  point  of  view,  this is a  desirable  allocation  of\r\n\r\nbusiness  resources.  The way to reduce this is not to interfere\r\n\r\nat the company level but to ensure that the macro incentives are\r\n\r\nconducive to a desirable pattern of resource allocation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we need to do our best to ensure that the\r\n\r\nproperty  bubble of the scale that was experienced in  the  past\r\n\r\ndoes not occur again and, in particular, that policy changes  do\r\n\r\nnot inadvertently contribute to the development of the bubble.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, we have been hearing\r\n\r\nmany  calls  from many Members of this House and also  from  the\r\n\r\npublic  to ask the Minister to help the ailing property  market.\r\n\r\nWhile  I  have  nothing against doing things to  strengthen  the\r\n\r\nfundamentals to ensure a solid base for the property  market,  I\r\n\r\ncannot agree to any attempt to artificially prop up the property\r\n\r\nmarket  or  to  open  the  market  to  speculation  as  we   had\r\n\r\nexperienced in the past, particularly from 1994 to 1996.  I feel\r\n\r\nthat the root cause of the cost competitiveness\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  and  the  high  cost  of  living  here  is   the\r\n\r\nartificially high prices of property, particularly  the  private\r\n\r\nproperty, both industrial and residential.  Companies  pay  high\r\n\r\nprices  for  land rentals and in buying buildings which  add  to\r\n\r\ntheir  cost. Similarly, retail and commercial users who have  to\r\n\r\npay high rental prices also see a much higher cost.  Ultimately,\r\n\r\nthe  high cost is passed on to the consumers or, in the case  of\r\n\r\nexports,  the  products  cannot compete with  products  produced\r\n\r\nelsewhere,  resulting in either lower margins or  losses.   This\r\n\r\nthen leads to companies closing down or scaling down to relocate\r\n\r\nto cheaper areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the people, Singaporeans in general, who have to\r\n\r\npay  high  prices  for their private properties  or  residential\r\n\r\nproperties,  will  demand high wages so that they  can  pay  for\r\n\r\ntheir mortgages.  Sir, this is a vicious circle which originates\r\n\r\nfrom the high cost of owning properties in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the property prices have come down in Singapore in\r\n\r\nthe  last  couple  of  years, the prices  here  are  still  high\r\n\r\ncompared  to  many  countries around the world.   In  fact,  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries have seen a similar drop  in  prices  by\r\n\r\nbigger percentages than what we have seen.  Furthermore, I  feel\r\n\r\nthat only a small cross section of our population has been hurt,\r\n\r\nparticularly those who bought their private properties from 1994\r\n\r\nto  1996, while we have a bigger potential population who may be\r\n\r\nable to purchase properties if the prices are lower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I have a few suggestions. First of all, I would like to\r\n\r\nrenew  my  call to the Government to decide on a long term  land\r\n\r\nsales policy for private property development for, say, 10 years\r\n\r\nat a time, and do not change the policy irregardless of what the\r\n\r\nstate  of the private property market is.  In this way,  we  can\r\n\r\nensure  certainty and we avoid jerking the market around  as  we\r\n\r\nhave  done  in  the past few years.  So I hope we will  continue\r\n\r\nwith  the  land sales at the end of this year when the time  for\r\n\r\nannouncement is due.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government basically sets the stage for\r\n\r\nprivate  property market by setting benchmark  prices  for  land\r\n\r\nsale  tenders.  Could the Ministry look into how the  mechanisms\r\n\r\ncan be changed to allow true market forces to rule?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way that the private property market gets propped\r\n\r\nup  is  by the prices the Ministry sets for new HDB flats.   The\r\n\r\ncurrent prices for new flats are too high with a very small  gap\r\n\r\nagainst  resale  HDB  flats  and also against  private  property\r\n\r\nmarket.   Sir,  while the quantum paid for new  flats  is  still\r\n\r\nlower, considering the renovation and furnishing costs of resale\r\n\r\nHDB  flats and private properties that are already in place when\r\n\r\na  person buys a property, I feel that it is about time that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  reviewed HDB prices for new flats, which  should  be\r\n\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, there has been a lot of talk about long term\r\n\r\nprices  of industrial land and to set the mechanism that is  not\r\n\r\ninternally based but based on external competitiveness.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister to clarify what is the mechanism  that\r\n\r\nwe have put in place so that in the long term we can ensure that\r\n\r\nour property prices remain competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, every year\r\n\r\nthe Government decides on land sales based on its assessment  of\r\n\r\nthe  supply  and  demand  for that particular  year.   With  the\r\n\r\ndownturn in the property market, the land sales announcement has\r\n\r\ngenerated  a  lot of interest, especially those associated  with\r\n\r\nthe   property  market.   I  believe  this  year  many  property\r\n\r\ndevelopers are very relieved by the delay of the land sales.  By\r\n\r\nthe  same  token, there are a lot of Singaporeans,  particularly\r\n\r\nyounger Singaporeans, like what Dr Wan Soon Bee pointed out, who\r\n\r\nare  thinking that although the prices have come down, they  are\r\n\r\nstill  relatively  high.   I join Dr Wan  in  appealing  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not to delay the land sales for too long.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nin  assessing how much land to release each year must perhaps be\r\n\r\na  very  fine  art  of  judgment of market  conditions  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the process in which it is being done is not\r\n\r\nvery  clear and transparent.  Perhaps, I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  how this process is done every year.  Also, there  are\r\n\r\ncertain  problems in this assessment in so far as the public  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  for example, how the Ministry determines  whether  a\r\n\r\nparticular  unit is occupied in assessing the total  supply  and\r\n\r\ndemand.   There  has been a lot of controversy and  much  debate\r\n\r\nabout  this in the media.  I would like the Minister to  clarify\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we find that very often it is the property\r\n\r\ndevelopers  who come out to the media to say various things  and\r\n\r\nput  some  pressure on the Government not to  release  land  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   In this regard, I would like to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  feasible to form a Land Sales Review  Committee\r\n\r\nwhich  could comprise not just representatives from the property\r\n\r\nsector,  but also with sufficient representation from  consumers\r\n\r\nthrough grassroots organisations and perhaps the NTUC.   Such  a\r\n\r\nCommittee can function similar to the National Wage Council  for\r\n\r\ndetermining  annual wages.  In the same way, this Committee  can\r\n\r\nrecommend to the Government how much land has to be released  on\r\n\r\na yearly basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Although I believe in a free market,\r\n\r\nespecially with regard to prices of private properties,  I  also\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  Government has a certain  responsibility  to\r\n\r\nregulate  and  ensure  that  the market  operates  smoothly  and\r\n\r\nefficiently. A market is only perfect if every player has access\r\n\r\nto  perfect  information.   Recent  events  highlighted  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers on the confusion arising from the interchangeable use\r\n\r\nof  the two terms - \"built in\" and \"built up\" - is an example of\r\n\r\nimperfect  information which may lead to market  failure.   Some\r\n\r\ndevelopers  and marketing agents have compounded the problem  by\r\n\r\nfreely  interchanging the use of the two terms.  The  Government\r\n\r\nhas been thus far silent on the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry\r\n\r\nintends  to  standardise the use of these two  terms  so  as  to\r\n\r\nremove all ambiguities from their use in market brochures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue which I would like to raise is with regard\r\n\r\nto  the  legal  liabilities of purchasers when they  default  at\r\n\r\ndifferent  stages of the legal completion process.  Here  again,\r\n\r\nthere  seems  to  be  some differences in the  understanding  or\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the  legal  provisions  governing   property\r\n\r\ntransactions.   I  think the Government should,  through  public\r\n\r\neducation or otherwise, inform all prospective purchasers  about\r\n\r\ntheir  legal  obligations.   The amount  of  money  involved  in\r\n\r\nproperty  transactions is very high and buyers should know  what\r\n\r\nthey  are  committing  themselves  to  before  they  enter   any\r\n\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I think I must\r\n\r\nbe  the  first  speaker today on land that does not  talk  about\r\n\r\nsales or price but about use and ownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calling for this cut to enhance public consultation on\r\n\r\nland  use,  perhaps  some  context may  be  useful.   First,  as\r\n\r\npublicly  noted,  Singapore's population is increasing.  We  are\r\n\r\nclose to four million now.  This is earlier than projected.   We\r\n\r\nare  reaching our year X scenario.  With this greater population\r\n\r\nof both Singaporeans and foreigners, there are even more demands\r\n\r\non  Singapore's  land  space. There  are  different  wishes  and\r\n\r\npriorities  and there is a need for balance. The aim,  moreover,\r\n\r\nis  not  just  to  squeeze everyone in in as tight  a  space  as\r\n\r\npossible,  to make do, anyhow.  Rather, our aim is  to  build  a\r\n\r\nworld class city of many amenities, physical and mental, with  a\r\n\r\ngood  environment, to make this our best home,  both  physically\r\n\r\nand  psychically.   In  this  sense, ownership,  familiarity  of\r\n\r\nsurroundings, conservation, and a good environment, are all  key\r\n\r\nattributes of land use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The context of today is also that a current review of the\r\n\r\nmaster plan is on-going.  In this, the main tool is what we call\r\n\r\nthe  Development  Plan  Guidelines  (DPG).  These  are  detailed\r\n\r\nspecifications on land use.  Often, it has been said that  these\r\n\r\nare  effective  rather  than  the use  of  environmental  impact\r\n\r\nassessments.  There are some existing forms for consultation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  land use today.  Elaborate models are sometimes developed by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry or its agencies, open to the public for discussion.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, events in the last year have been of concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first has been that this House has made some changes in\r\n\r\nproperty  rights.  I can think of two issues which have detained\r\n\r\nthis  House.  First, the Strata Titles Act allowing for  private\r\n\r\nredevelopment and the second, HDB powers to acquire  a  property\r\n\r\nwhile upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second change has been public acquisition for private\r\n\r\nredevelopment  and  use.  And there is an  on-going  controversy\r\n\r\nover the Dawson Road properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is that there has been use of nature reserves for\r\n\r\nother  uses.   Here, there was some use of nature  reserves  for\r\n\r\nwater  storage  tanks.   And second, a decision  not  to  follow\r\n\r\nthrough  on  some aspects of the Green Plan that the  Government\r\n\r\nadopted in the early 1990s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not arguing that all these changes are wrong. In this\r\n\r\nHouse  and in the media, I have expressed my views on these  and\r\n\r\non  other  matters.  I will not repeat my points.  But  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  in  sum, we are pointing to a more general need to enhance\r\n\r\npublic consultation.  This is especially when Government changes\r\n\r\nthe  law or policy or goes against its original statement,  such\r\n\r\nas  the  Green Plan, or changes the use, which has already  been\r\n\r\nidentified  under the land use plan, such as the use  of  nature\r\n\r\nreserves  for  other purposes.  The Government, of  course,  may\r\n\r\nhave  its reasons for these changes.  But I ask the Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider that people too have concerns and perspectives and they\r\n\r\nhave  their  interests arising from what Government has  already\r\n\r\nsaid and planned.  Thus, when changes are made, I will encourage\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  and  his agencies to engage in a  full,  rational\r\n\r\ndiscussion  and consultation to explain and also to  listen.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  where  the Government is rational  and  has  good\r\n\r\nreasons,  Singaporeans  can be convinced.   Some  may  not,  but\r\n\r\nothers will understand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  respect  the  Government's views.  Trust, transparency  and\r\n\r\naccountability  are not only terms we should use  for  financial\r\n\r\nmatters, but also about land use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, citizens end up using the court legal system\r\n\r\nto  challenge the Government for breach of what they think of as\r\n\r\nthe  public  trust in the use of land. This is not  good.   Even\r\n\r\nthough  I  am  a  lawyer, I would not encourage  such  litigious\r\n\r\npractice.   But  just as the Government has  a  land  bank,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has a bank of trust.  If it is an urgent matter,  it\r\n\r\ncan  draw  on the bank of trust and use it without consultation.\r\n\r\nBut  where  land  use  is  important but  not  urgent,  I  would\r\n\r\nencourage the Minister to consider a full public consultation on\r\n\r\nland use where land policy is changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to take these proceedings with the time constraint in\r\n\r\nmind.   In  case Members do not realise, we are all  given  four\r\n\r\nminutes  per cut.  So this segment should have taken 32 minutes,\r\n\r\nbut since Members have taken 30 minutes, you will get a 2-minute\r\n\r\nresponse  from  the Minister.  You have all made  very  eloquent\r\n\r\nspeeches.   Mr Simon Tay has asked the Government to listen  and\r\n\r\nexplain.   Since  I  have  two  minutes,  it  shall  be  largely\r\n\r\nlistening, and not very much explanation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I will just take the key points. First, the correction\r\n\r\nin  the  property market has progressed reasonably well.   These\r\n\r\nadjustments  in  the  property  values  and  rentals,  like  the\r\n\r\nreduction in wages, have ensured that we remain competitive, vis-a-vis  the  other international cities.  The correction  in  the\r\n\r\nproperty  market has been achieved without posing  any  systemic\r\n\r\nrisk  to  the  financial sector. This is very important  because\r\n\r\nsince  we introduced the anti-speculation measures in May  1996,\r\n\r\nour  banks have taken prudent steps to reduce their exposure  to\r\n\r\nthe  property market.  The banks are also well capitalised  with\r\n\r\ncapital  adequacy  ratios well above the BIS' guidelines.   They\r\n\r\nhave  also  made  prudent  provisions for  their  non-performing\r\n\r\nloans.   Therefore, our banks are in a strong position  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe uncertainties ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we have this firewall between the property market and\r\n\r\nthe  financial sector, we can expect to let the property  market\r\n\r\ncontinue its current consolidation process.  The Government will\r\n\r\ntherefore let the existing property market measures run the full\r\n\r\ncourse  and  there is no need to introduce any new  measures  at\r\n\r\nthis point in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, I want to stress that we will continue to\r\n\r\nstick  to our long-term policies on the property market.   There\r\n\r\nare  three  key elements:  First, we want to maintain prudential\r\n\r\nmeasures  in  the property market.  Second, we want  to  release\r\n\r\nsufficient  land  to  meet the medium-term  demand  through  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  land  sales  programme.   And,  third,  we  want  to\r\n\r\nencourage   greater   transparency  by  providing   timely   and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive real estate information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me take the various suggestions of the MPs in these\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On prudential measures, the demand is there, especially\r\n\r\nfrom  the  HDB  upgraders.   The  core  measures  like  the  80%\r\n\r\nfinancing  limit  on  mortgage loans will therefore  remain.   I\r\n\r\nagree with the views of many of the Members that we do not  want\r\n\r\nto  encourage another speculative bubble and therefore we should\r\n\r\nnot allow easy credit to fill a new speculative boom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government land sales programme, I have heard both\r\n\r\nviews,  for and against the resumption of the sale.  Our  policy\r\n\r\nremains  the  same.   First,  our property  prices  must  remain\r\n\r\naffordable  and  competitive  in order  to  retain  and  attract\r\n\r\ntalent.  Therefore, the Government has set aside sufficient land\r\n\r\nto  meet  the housing aspirations of Singaporeans and to  ensure\r\n\r\ncompetitive  housing for foreign talent.  And  we  will  release\r\n\r\nthese  lands at a steady pace to meet the demand over the longer\r\n\r\nterm.  The Government has suspended land sales in 1998 and  1999\r\n\r\nin  view  of the regional economic crisis.  We will resume  land\r\n\r\nsales  as  soon  as practicable in tandem with  the  medium-term\r\n\r\ndemand.  As I have announced earlier, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nland  sales  decision for year 2000 would be made  in  September\r\n\r\nthis year.  We will review the demand and supply situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mr Sinnakaruppan, let me assure him that the land\r\n\r\nsales  process is fairly transparent and logical.  We take  into\r\n\r\naccount  what  is  in the current stock, what is  the  projected\r\n\r\ndemand  and  the supply in the pipeline.  And we  will  announce\r\n\r\nthis  in  September  for  the  next  year  within  a  multi-tier\r\n\r\nframework.  So it is fairly transparent and rational.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that the Government set a 10-year land sales programme and do not deviate from it in good\r\n\r\ntimes  or  bad.   This  is  too inflexible,  because  conditions\r\n\r\naffecting   demand   and   supply  of  properties   can   change\r\n\r\nsubstantially  over such a long period.  I  think  the  last  10\r\n\r\nyears  is a case in point.  It would not have been possible  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to totally ignore the speculative froth in  1995\r\n\r\nand  1996  or  the regional economic crisis in  1997  and  1998.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is prudent that the Government continue  with  its\r\n\r\ncurrent  practice  of reviewing the land sales  programme  every\r\n\r\nyear, but within the medium-term framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third element of the Government's property policies is\r\n\r\nto  make  sure  the information flow is timely and comprehensive\r\n\r\nand  to  encourage market transparency.  We do so by having  the\r\n\r\nURA  to  release comprehensive and timely data.   This  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant  to  make sure that the market works efficiently,  and\r\n\r\nthe  URA will continue to improve the quality and timeliness  of\r\n\r\nthese data.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked how the occupancy rates are\r\n\r\ncomputed.  This the URA does with a standard survey method.  For\r\n\r\ncommercial   and  industrial  properties,  URA  ascertains   the\r\n\r\noccupancy  through quarterly surveys of the property owners  and\r\n\r\ntheir  agents, as well as site visits.  For private  residential\r\n\r\nproperties,  the  URA infers the occupancy from the  consumption\r\n\r\nlevels  of water and electricity on Power Supply's records,  ie,\r\n\r\nif  the  house  does  not record a certain  level  of  water  or\r\n\r\nelectricity,  we  deem the house to be not occupied.   URA  also\r\n\r\ncarries out field visits\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto confirm whether properties are actually occupied for doubtful\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai asked for HDB to join with private developers. I\r\n\r\nthink  HDB is quite tied up, with its hands full, with  its  own\r\n\r\nprogramme,  without  having to dabble in  the  private  property\r\n\r\nmarket.   He  asked  for  HDB flats to be  privatised.   I  have\r\n\r\nanswered before that this is not something that we rule out, but\r\n\r\nit is not something in the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan asked us to make sure Government policies\r\n\r\ndo  not contribute to the property volatility.  I think we  will\r\n\r\nbe  more careful in future Government policies.  We try to be as\r\n\r\nwise as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will refer to the pricing of new HDB flats later on when\r\n\r\nthere is a segment on HDB flat price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked how industrial land is priced. I\r\n\r\nwill refer him to MTI.  Industrial land pricing policy is set by\r\n\r\nMTI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked for a land sales review committee,\r\n\r\nmuch  like  the  NWC.   I  think we  have  enough  processes  of\r\n\r\ndialogues with the various players.  We can look at whether such\r\n\r\na  review committee is workable.  I can tell you that it is  not\r\n\r\nvery  difficult.  We just set X number of units to be sold every\r\n\r\nyear and we try not to deviate from that number, unless there is\r\n\r\na major change in the environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau asked the Government to intervene to\r\n\r\nstandardise  the  use  of  terms and also  stipulate  the  legal\r\n\r\nliabilities of buyers.  I think the two instances he referred to\r\n\r\nare  presently  in  court,  because  there  are  differences  in\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the sales and purchase  agreement  and  also\r\n\r\nthere is no standard definition of \"built-in\" area or \"built-up\"\r\n\r\narea.   I think we will leave it to the court to decide on these\r\n\r\ntwo issues first and, if necessary, my Ministry will talk to the\r\n\r\nvarious  participants to resolve this issue.  But  to  intervene\r\n\r\nnow when there is a court case, I think, would not be wise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked for more consultation so as not to\r\n\r\ndiminish the reservoir of goodwill.  I agree with him.  I  think\r\n\r\nwe  would try to present our plans.  We do that regularly.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  our Development Guide Plans plus any changes  in  land\r\n\r\nuse,  we  do  it  in  a very systematic way.   But  in  specific\r\n\r\ninstances,  whether it is water tank in the nature  reserves,  I\r\n\r\nthink  such  issues ought to be explained more, so that  we  can\r\n\r\nconvince the public that it is a necessary decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, let me begin by\r\n\r\nstating that this is not a critique of existing housing policies\r\n\r\nwhich  have served us well.  It is an appeal for an exercise  of\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility  towards Singaporeans  who  may  be  caught\r\n\r\nunwittingly by the current economic crisis.  Allow me,  Sir,  to\r\n\r\nnow cite some live examples for the Minister's consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Scenario One</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drop in HDB resale prices has correspondingly led to\r\n\r\nfluctuating  valuation levels.  This has  given  rise  to  cases\r\n\r\nwhere a Sale and Purchase Agreement is entered into at an older,\r\n\r\nhigher  valuation level, and transaction completed  at  a  lower\r\n\r\nvaluation  level,  leading  to  a  shortfall  in  loan   quantum\r\n\r\neligibility.   Such a situation places parties involved  in  the\r\n\r\ntransaction in a dilemma and creates a cash squeeze.   Can  some\r\n\r\nkind of bridging finance be provided for the shortfall?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Scenario Two</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans need more time to dispose of their\r\n\r\nexisting  flats  upon taking delivery of their new  flats.   The\r\n\r\nsluggish market has led to lower-than-expected resale prices, so\r\n\r\nboth  timing and price expectations frequently go out of  whack.\r\n\r\nConsequently, pressure from having to meet the deadline to  sell\r\n\r\noff  the existing flat mounts and stress is felt, especially  by\r\n\r\nthe  upgraders.   Even if the grace period were  extended,  they\r\n\r\nwould  still  frequently have to finance two  flats  during  the\r\n\r\ninterim  period.   Can some restructuring of  the  two  mortgage\r\n\r\nschemes  be  allowed  so as to enable them to  cope  financially\r\n\r\nduring this time?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Scenario Three</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet some other Singaporeans have no choice but to withdraw\r\n\r\ntheir  applications or reject allocations for new flats.  Others\r\n\r\nare  forced  by  business or financial woes  to  downgrade  from\r\n\r\nprivate properties or existing HDB flats.  Some of these persons\r\n\r\nhave  no  means  to buy on the resale market but are  disallowed\r\n\r\nfrom  applying for a rental flat under current rules.   Can  the\r\n\r\nconsequences of their decision, in terms of debarment,  penalty,\r\n\r\nor forfeiture be administered with flexibility?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a comment on sale among ethnic grouping\r\n\r\nguidelines.  Sir, allocation along ethnic grouping guidelines is\r\n\r\nwell  justified.  Unfortunately, they pose a real  challenge  to\r\n\r\nresale  potential during this crisis, owing to  a  much  smaller\r\n\r\nmarket demand. Can the Minister comment on how the HDB can  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans cope with this crisis, specifically for  the  above\r\n\r\nscenarios?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan Cheng Bock is not here. Dr Wang Kai\r\n\r\nYuen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, HDB has a policy to\r\n\r\nmaintain   the   distribution  of   ethnic   households   in   a\r\n\r\nneighbourhood to reflect the racial composition of  our  nation.\r\n\r\nI  support this policy.  This is a wise policy.  However, strict\r\n\r\nimplementation of this policy might cause difficulties when  the\r\n\r\nowners  try to sell their flats in the resale market.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially  so  for the precincts that are physically  small  in\r\n\r\nsize.  One case in point is the Toh Yi Estate in the Bukit Timah\r\n\r\nGRC.   There  are altogether only 19 blocks in the precinct,  in\r\n\r\nfact two of which are 4-storey shophouse blocks and two more are\r\n\r\nwalk-up  4-storey  maisonette apartments.  So  actually  we  are\r\n\r\ntalking about a very small precinct here, and this is a precinct\r\n\r\nfavoured  by  the Chinese without too many facilities  that  the\r\n\r\nother  races  would normally prefer.  In fact,  there  are  many\r\n\r\ncases  of  Malay owners trying to sell their flats in  the  open\r\n\r\nmarket and the only buyers they could find are Chinese families.\r\n\r\nHDB  would typically disapprove of such sales.  This has  caused\r\n\r\ngreat financial hardship to these Malay families,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nespecially during this time of economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the HDB could be\r\n\r\nflexible  in implementing this policy to take into consideration\r\n\r\nsituations like the Toh Yi Estate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chng is not here. Mr Kenneth Chen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, during 1996 the\r\n\r\nwaiting list for HDB flats had gone up to around 150,000.  Since\r\n\r\nthe  start of the financial crisis, the number of applicants has\r\n\r\ndeclined  rapidly.  I understand that it is around  80,000  now.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the  shorter waiting list and many have  downgraded\r\n\r\ntheir  flat  type, some of the applicants have been  advised  to\r\n\r\ntake  possession  of their flats earlier than  scheduled.   This\r\n\r\npresented a lot of problems for the applicants because when they\r\n\r\nmade the application for the flat, they coincide the timing with\r\n\r\nthe  selling of their existing flat, especially those upgraders.\r\n\r\nAnd  when  they  are  asked to take possession  of  their  flats\r\n\r\nearlier,  some  of them are unable to do so.  They  cannot  sell\r\n\r\ntheir existing flat in time because of the time restriction  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  cannot meet the financial obligation  for  their  new\r\n\r\nflat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the HDB can look into this and make the\r\n\r\nnecessary adjustments, so that the applicants can receive a more\r\n\r\naccurate  hand-over date and enable them to  make  their  change\r\n\r\nover to coincide with the HDB schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister what is the impact of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  decrease  in number of units to be  built  on  the  HDB\r\n\r\nbuilding  programme.  Would the scaling down affect the  pricing\r\n\r\nof   the  flats,  since  the  price  of  the  flat  takes   into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  overall overhead and  administration  costs?\r\n\r\nAnd how did HDB forecast the number of flats to be built in such\r\n\r\na time of uncertainty?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, at the\r\n\r\nmoment,  more  than  86% of our population  are  living  in  HDB\r\n\r\nestates,  and   96%   own their flats under the  home  ownership\r\n\r\nscheme.  In\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\norder  to ensure that old estates enjoy better facilities and  a\r\n\r\nbetter living environment, various upgrading programmes such  as\r\n\r\nthe  MUP, IUP and Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment Scheme  (SERS)\r\n\r\nare introduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to qualify for the Interim Upgrading Programme (IUP),\r\n\r\nthe  flats  must be between 10 and 17 years of age.   Under  the\r\n\r\nprogramme,  the Government bears all the expenses  incurred  and\r\n\r\nthe  residents do not have to pay for anything.  Upgrading works\r\n\r\nare  carried out outside the flats and the inconvenience  caused\r\n\r\nto  residents  is minimal.  IUP improves the living  environment\r\n\r\nand enhances the value of the flats.  Usually, IUP receives more\r\n\r\nthan  95%  of  support from the residents.  In some  cases,  the\r\n\r\nsupport is as high as 99%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Main Upgrading Programme (MUP) is meant for flats which\r\n\r\nare more than 17 years old.  In this case, residents have to pay\r\n\r\nbetween  $15,000 and $25,000 per unit to have their  floor  area\r\n\r\nincreased by about 6 square metres at the balcony or the toilet.\r\n\r\nWorks  have  to be carried out inside the flats, and  the  whole\r\n\r\nproject  takes  some  two  or three  years  to  complete.   Much\r\n\r\ninconvenience  is  caused  to  the  residents,  especially   the\r\n\r\nchildren and old people.  The flats are all very old and most of\r\n\r\nthem  have  leaking  ceilings.  Even after the  upgrading,  this\r\n\r\nproblem  still exists.  Of late, the support rate  for  MUP  has\r\n\r\ndropped from 90% to about 80%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third scheme is SERS which is for flats of 25 years old and\r\n\r\nabove.   In Singapore, land is scarce.  In order to make  better\r\n\r\nuse  of the limited land available, and because these flats  are\r\n\r\nvery   old,   it   makes  more  sense  to  demolish   them   for\r\n\r\nredevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three proposals to make. Firstly, increase the\r\n\r\nnumber of IUP precincts from 18 to 25 so that more residents can\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  benefits.  Multi-storey car parks and  lifts  should\r\n\r\nalso be included in the IUP.  Secondly, reduce the number of MUP\r\n\r\nprecincts  from  five to three, and that it be done  selectively\r\n\r\nfor areas which have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  4- to 5-room flats.  If possible, this MUP can be repealed\r\n\r\nfor  redistribution  into the IUP programme or  SERS  programme.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  I  hope  that MND can launch about  10  or  more  SERS\r\n\r\nprogrammes because this kind of redevelopment programme will not\r\n\r\nonly  benefit  HDB but also the residents.  So it is  a  win-win\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to request the\r\n\r\nMinister  to reconsider the overall development of flats  in  my\r\n\r\nBukit Gombak Constituency to solve the problems of some of these\r\n\r\nvery old flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, the Government introduced two\r\n\r\nupgrading  programmes,  Interim  Upgrading  and  Main  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgrammes,  to  help upgrade older housing estates.   Over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  the  Interim Upgrading Programme has been  expanded  and\r\n\r\nnow, with the inclusion of the lift landing at every floor, many\r\n\r\nresidents find that IUP is almost as important as MUP.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nthe  main distinguishing feature in the MUP is the space  adding\r\n\r\nitem  (SAI).   But looking at the feedback from many  residents,\r\n\r\nmost  residents  are very happy with the lift landing  in  every\r\n\r\nfloor and covered linkways that takes them to the bus stop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, space adding item. During the pilot phase, it was\r\n\r\nallocated 10 square metres.  But over the years, it was  reduced\r\n\r\nto  6  square metres and to build a bedroom with 6 square metres\r\n\r\nis indeed very difficult.  I am sure, Sir, you will find it very\r\n\r\ndifficult to go into a 6 square metre bedroom.  Sometimes, it is\r\n\r\nused  for  toilet, utility room or an extension of the  balcony,\r\n\r\nand so on, of the living room.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the size and cost, as Mr Ang Mong Seng has just\r\n\r\npointed  out, it costs about $25,000 in total to build this  SAI\r\n\r\nfor  4-room  or 5-room flat and the residents pay about  $15,000\r\n\r\nfor  a  4-room flat and about $17,000 for a 5-room  flat.   This\r\n\r\nworks out to a total cost of about $4,200 per square metre which\r\n\r\nby  HDB cost standards is relatively high.  Sir, given this  and\r\n\r\ngiven  the trend that many 4-roomers and 5 roomers are  starting\r\n\r\nto upgrade to ECs and low-end private properties, I think\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  question whether there is a need to offer,  as  an\r\n\r\noption,  SAI  for  4 roomers and 5 roomers.  I  believe  that  3\r\n\r\nroomers  will  still  find that having this  SAI  will  be  very\r\n\r\nuseful,  particularly with the larger Government  subsidy.   But\r\n\r\nmaybe  it is time to review the SAI option for 4-room and 5-room\r\n\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, since 1992, selected old HDB flats\r\n\r\nhave  been  undergoing upgrading through the Main Upgrading  and\r\n\r\nthe  Interim Upgrading Programmes.  These programmes are  highly\r\n\r\npopular  with  the residents since they have brought  about  new\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  amenities  in  the  precinct  as  well  as   an\r\n\r\nenhancement in the value of the flat in the resale market.   The\r\n\r\nrecent  announcement on the cutback of the upgrading  programmes\r\n\r\nas  a result of the economic recession has to some extent put  a\r\n\r\nbrake  on  these  upgrading projects and  perhaps  given  us  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to review the programmes.  I would like  to  suggest\r\n\r\ntwo areas for such a review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the selection of precincts for upgrading, HDB\r\n\r\nshould  consult  the  MP  concerned in  the  identification  and\r\n\r\ndemarcation  of the precincts.  This is necessary  because  over\r\n\r\ntime,  neighbourhoods would have evolved and  established  their\r\n\r\nown  identities  through activities organised by the  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.   When a precinct is selected for  upgrading,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  more meaningful if residents can identify  with  that\r\n\r\nprecinct.   Currently, the lack of consultation  has  led  to  a\r\n\r\nselected precinct that straddles two RC zones, as happened in my\r\n\r\nconstituency.  The improvement works which are being planned may\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  duplicated  because  of  the  need  to  serve  the\r\n\r\nactivities of two different Residents' Committees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my second issue. While there is no doubt\r\n\r\nthat  the upgrading programmes have helped to improve the living\r\n\r\nenvironment of the old HDB estates, I am concerned that some  of\r\n\r\nthe features and projects being introduced in some precincts are\r\n\r\nrepetitive and not fully utilised.  For example, it is  a  waste\r\n\r\nto  have  covered linkways all over the precinct just to satisfy\r\n\r\nevery single resident.  Features\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich  may  have high aesthetic value but are hardly  used  when\r\n\r\ncompleted  are really unnecessary.  Such duplication  and  under\r\n\r\nusage is not cost effective.  Besides they have a serious impact\r\n\r\non the long term maintenance cost.  Perhaps the HDB could ensure\r\n\r\ngreater  coordination amongst the precincts undergoing upgrading\r\n\r\nso  that  the improvement works carried out are well chosen  and\r\n\r\ncost  effective.   If  we  could  cut  down  on  some  of  these\r\n\r\nduplications  and  unnecessary improvement  works,  the  savings\r\n\r\ncould  be  redistributed to more precincts  and  more  residents\r\n\r\ncould benefit from the upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Since 1992, HDB\r\n\r\nhas  been  selling shops to sitting tenants, and has sold  about\r\n\r\n7,600  shop  units hitherto.  In  1997, HDB also began  to  sell\r\n\r\nsome 30-year lease shops at a lower price because the lease  was\r\n\r\nshorter.   These  cheaper  shops were welcomed  by  the  sitting\r\n\r\ntenants.   Up  till now, some 444 units of 30-year  lease  shops\r\n\r\nhave been sold under the scheme to the sitting tenants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in April 1998, HDB stopped selling its shop units.\r\n\r\nMany  shopkeepers want to know when will HDB sell the  shops  to\r\n\r\nthem.   I  believe HDB is holding back the sale because  of  the\r\n\r\npoor  sentiments in the property market today, and to sell  shop\r\n\r\nunits  at this moment will further lower the value of the shops,\r\n\r\nand  people  who bought the shops earlier would feel  they  have\r\n\r\nsuffered  a book loss as they had bought their shops earlier  at\r\n\r\nhigher  prices.  On the other hand, those who have  yet  to  buy\r\n\r\nover  the  shops which they are renting at the moment desire  to\r\n\r\nbuy  the shops now because the prices are low at this moment and\r\n\r\nit  is the right time for them to buy their shops.  If HDB holds\r\n\r\nback  the  sale  of these shops to them, they will  harbour  the\r\n\r\nfeeling that HDB is waiting for prices to go up before they sell\r\n\r\nthe shops with the aim of making more profits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, HDB has already sold about 7,600 units of shops. The\r\n\r\nremaining  number of shops to be sold will not  be  very  large.\r\n\r\nThat being the case, as long as the number of units offered  for\r\n\r\nsale is not too large, the effect of lowering the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexisting price will not be very significant.  So I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister consider the request of the shop tenants  to\r\n\r\nresume  the sale of shops to them, especially the 30-year  lease\r\n\r\nshops which are very popular among the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nto  the  industrial and commercial sector, the problem  of  land\r\n\r\nrent  has  all  along been a big headache.  It  is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nbiggest items in their business cost.  Fortunately, in the  cost\r\n\r\ncutting  package  announced last November,  the  Government  has\r\n\r\nattached  great importance to this matter.  It has  also  agreed\r\n\r\nwith   the   recommendation  of  the  Committee  on  Singapore's\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness  (CSC) that the two biggest  landlords,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe  JTC and HDB, should also adopt the rent reduction measures,\r\n\r\nparticularly  to  reduce  the  rents  of  industrial  land   and\r\n\r\nfactories  substantially down to the level of the  early  1990s.\r\n\r\nThe  industrial and commercial sector is of course very grateful\r\n\r\nto the Government for its care and concern for the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many people in the trade are sceptical about the\r\n\r\nimplementation of these measures.  The main concern is while the\r\n\r\nGovernment has agreed to reduce the rent substantially  to  that\r\n\r\nof  the  level of the early 1990s, the tenants of HDB are  still\r\n\r\nrequired to enter into a lease agreement with the authorities on\r\n\r\nthe  \"posted  rent\" and a pre-determined rate of increase.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  what is the basis for the fixing of  this  posted\r\n\r\nrate,  and  whether it is in line with the market  condition  or\r\n\r\nbased  on  other  factors?   By  right,  if  the  Government  is\r\n\r\ndetermined  to reduce the rents to the level of the early  1990s\r\n\r\nto  ensure our competitiveness, then the terms in the new  lease\r\n\r\nagreement should be based on the level of the 1990s.  But I feel\r\n\r\nthe  present lease agreements are still being entered into based\r\n\r\non  the  recent  years'  level,  and  the  authorities  have  no\r\n\r\nintention of reducing the rents to the level of the early 1990s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a company which has leased some industrial land from\r\n\r\nHDB in Defu\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Estate  on a 30-year lease in order  to  manufacture\r\n\r\nlight industrial products. According to the terms stipulated  by\r\n\r\nHDB,  the  land rent would be increased annually  by  7.6%  from\r\n\r\n1990.   By  1999,  the rent per square foot has been  raised  to\r\n\r\n$59.91,  a  total  increase  of 71.2%.   According  to  the  CSC\r\n\r\nrecommendations, the rent should be adjusted  to  the  level  of\r\n\r\n1990,  that  is, at $35 per square foot.  But in the  new  lease\r\n\r\nagreement  with HDB, the rent is reduced by only 10%  to  $53.90\r\n\r\nper  square  foot  and thereafter it would  have  to  be  raised\r\n\r\nannually by 4%.  According to feedback from people in the trade,\r\n\r\nthe  market  rental  value of industrial  premises  (or  factory\r\n\r\nspace)  in this area has already dropped from its peak of  $2.50\r\n\r\nper  square foot to about $0.80 per square foot, which is a drop\r\n\r\nof  68%.  Even then, it is difficult to get tenants.  Since  the\r\n\r\nmarket  value has gone down by such a big scale, why is it  that\r\n\r\nthe  HDB is only providing for a 10% reduction in the land rent?\r\n\r\nHow can we convince the people that the Government is determined\r\n\r\nto  adjust the rent of industrial land to the level of the early\r\n\r\n1990s?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business community has suffered a great impact from this\r\n\r\ncrisis  and apart from trying to solve all the problems  in  the\r\n\r\noperation,  they  have  to  find  ways  and  means  to   upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves to enhance their competitiveness.  What they need  is\r\n\r\na favourable business environment provided by the Government for\r\n\r\nthem  to set up their business, to develop their business so  as\r\n\r\nto contribute to our economic and social development.  Rent is a\r\n\r\nburden that the businessman cannot run away with, so we have  to\r\n\r\nreduce  it  to a reasonably low level, otherwise they will  have\r\n\r\ndifficulties  making  ends meet and the effectiveness  of  these\r\n\r\ncost-cutting measures will be in doubt.  In view of that, I hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government would set up an independent  committee  to\r\n\r\noversee  adjustments to rents for industrial  land  and  factory\r\n\r\nspace  to  ensure HDB and the JTC would abide by the  principles\r\n\r\nset  down  by  the cost-cutting package, thereby reducing  their\r\n\r\nrents to the level of the early 1990s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for difficulties faced by the tenants, I hope that the\r\n\r\nrelevant authorities would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngive  them  the  necessary assistance and not to rub  salt  into\r\n\r\ntheir wounds by imposing an interest rate of as high as 8.5% for\r\n\r\narrears  in  rent.   I  think we should reduce  the  rent  to  a\r\n\r\nreasonable level, and help the businesses which are in  trouble.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  for  those  who  simply  cannot  carry  on  with  their\r\n\r\nbusiness, the authorities should consider taking back  the  land\r\n\r\nor  factory space at a reasonable price and then rent it out  to\r\n\r\nother parties so that the land could be recycled and put to good\r\n\r\nuse.   Land  is  scarce  in Singapore and  it  is  an  important\r\n\r\nresource  relied  upon  by the businessmen  for  their  business\r\n\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in its report issued last year, the CSC has also\r\n\r\nemphasized on the optimal use of our land to make sure that  the\r\n\r\nland would be rented out at a reasonable and competitive rate so\r\n\r\nthat  we  can have a world-class infrastructure on our land.   I\r\n\r\nfeel that the available land in our HDB estates should be put to\r\n\r\nfull  use  by  allowing  some  suitable  economic  and  business\r\n\r\nactivities to be carried out in the common areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the Government would allow the residential\r\n\r\nunits  above  the shophouses to be used for business  activities\r\n\r\ntoo.   Most  Singaporeans have their own  apartments,  and  more\r\n\r\noften than not, these residential units above the shophouses are\r\n\r\nnot occupied.  If we could allow these units to be used for some\r\n\r\nform  of business or commercial activities, they can be  put  to\r\n\r\ngood  use, and at the same time it will help to reduce  business\r\n\r\ncost for the shopkeepers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, to meet the rising\r\n\r\nexpectations  of  Singaporeans, HDB  has  been  building  better\r\n\r\nquality  flats  over the last 10 years.  More sophisticated  and\r\n\r\ncomplex  designs were introduced in many estates and  new  towns\r\n\r\nespecially  with  the  introduction of  design-and-build  flats.\r\n\r\nToday,  you can see that our HDB flats come in different designs\r\n\r\nand a wide variety of building finishes and fittings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the design of flats has increased the aesthetic\r\n\r\nvalue of our flats,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  are  some problems associated with these designs.   These\r\n\r\nproblems may be classified into the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Maintenance problems - certain designs pose maintenance\r\n\r\nproblems.  For example, the introduction of protruding  concrete\r\n\r\nor steel sunshades on the facade of buildings has obstructed the\r\n\r\nmovement  of gondola for re-painting works.  The use of tempered\r\n\r\nglass for covered linkways and low level glass light fittings is\r\n\r\nprone to frequent vandalism and abuses;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Maintenance cost - the use of expensive light fittings and\r\n\r\nfinishes  has  increased  the cost of  maintenance  drastically.\r\n\r\nThis has added much financial burden to Town Councils;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Security problems - certain designs of flats have dark\r\n\r\r\ncorners  or  easy access for thieves to gain entry  into  flats.\r\n\r\nEnclosed  fire escape staircases also provide a convenient  spot\r\n\r\nfor drug abusers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Mosquito breeding - the provision of bamboo hanging poles\r\n\r\nand ponding of water at roofs, parapet walls, and scupper drains\r\n\r\nare  potential  mosquito  breeding  grounds.   Sometimes,  these\r\n\r\nbreeding grounds are inaccessible for maintenance; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Noise problem - inadequate consideration in the design of\r\n\r\nthe layout of flat and acoustic provision may cause much problem\r\n\r\nin  noise  pollution.   More neighbours are complaining  against\r\n\r\neach other of noise nuisance in recent years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend the PAP Town Councils for taking the initiative\r\n\r\nto  form  a  Maintenance  Feedback Committee  which  is  working\r\n\r\nclosely  with HDB to further improve the designs of  our  flats.\r\n\r\nWith  constructive  feedback,  I  am  confident  that  PAP  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  will  provide  a  better quality  environment  to  our\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to suggest the following for the\r\n\r\nMinistry to consider:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Conduct an independent quality audit on the design of HDB\r\n\r\nflats during the design stage;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Document good design practices to guide architects and\r\n\r\nengineers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Second architects and engineers to Town Councils to better\r\n\r\nunderstand maintenance problems; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Set a buildable and CONQUAS score to be achieved for all\r\n\r\nHDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in 1997, I wrote to HDB\r\n\r\nto  inform  them  that  the  design  of  new  flats  in  Hougang\r\n\r\nConstituency was such that it was prone to burglary. After  some\r\n\r\ninvestigation by its architecture department, HDB told  me  that\r\n\r\nno burglar would take such a big risk climbing over the external\r\n\r\nwall  to  enter a flat.  However, a recent report of the  Police\r\n\r\nconfirmed that what the residents in the area were worried about\r\n\r\ncould  indeed happen.  I would like to know whether HDB has  any\r\n\r\nremedial  measures for such defective designs  which  can  cause\r\n\r\nsecurity problems to the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I notice that in the new precincts, blocks of\r\n\r\nflats  are  built  very close to one another.  I  have  received\r\n\r\nfeedback  from  the residents that the flats are so  close  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  fight  with people in the opposite blocks  simply  by\r\n\r\nstretching out their bamboo poles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, at the 5th Southeast-Asian Geographical\r\n\r\nConference,  the Geography Department of our National  Institute\r\n\r\nof  Education presented a study report which revealed  that  the\r\n\r\ndesign  of  many HDB flats is such that there is difficulty  for\r\n\r\nheat  to  be dispersed at night, thereby resulting in a  general\r\n\r\nrise  of  temperature in Singapore.  One of the factors is  that\r\n\r\nthe blocks of flats are built too close to one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether in developing new towns, HDB has\r\n\r\ntaken  consideration  into the possible effect  on  our  natural\r\n\r\nenvironment and the question of privacy of the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, the number of first-timers who dropped\r\n\r\nout of the new flat queue increased from about 950 in the fourth\r\n\r\nquarter  of  1997 to about 3,000 one year later  in  the  fourth\r\n\r\nquarter  of  1998.   There  are various  reasons  cited  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in a written answer.  Of all the reasons, two  of  the\r\n\r\nmost important must surely be price and size.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, property prices, including a resale HDB flat, has fallen\r\n\r\nroughly  to about the 1993 levels.  In contrast, the  prices  of\r\n\r\nnew  HDB  flats have not dropped.  Surely the prices of new  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  should move in line with the rest of the market.   Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  they are costed at historical prices when  land  prices\r\n\r\nwere still very high?  Also, since land sale has stopped for one\r\n\r\nyear,  at  what price does HDB buy land?  Surely this cannot  be\r\n\r\nset  at  historical  prices  which do not  sufficiently  reflect\r\n\r\nmarket  movements.  I understand that new HDB flats  are  highly\r\n\r\nsubsidised.   I am not suggesting that the subsidy be  increased\r\n\r\nin order for prices to fall.  But perhaps there could be a float\r\n\r\nwhere the prices of HDB flats are concerned and it is this float\r\n\r\nfactor which could move with the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason for the dropping out could be because new flats\r\n\r\nare  much  smaller than existing flats of the  same  type.   For\r\n\r\nexample, up to two years ago, 4-room flats were about 110 square\r\n\r\nmetres in size.  Now they are about 90 square metres.  And a new\r\n\r\n5-room flat now has the same floor area as an older 4-room flat.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  puzzle to me that as per capita incomes in  Singapore\r\n\r\nrise,  flats  of  the same type are getting smaller  instead  of\r\n\r\ngetting larger.  On top of that, the civil defence shelter takes\r\n\r\nup additional space.  Could one of the reasons be because of the\r\n\r\nfact that two years ago, during the height of the property boom,\r\n\r\nland  prices  were so high that a 125-square metre  5-room  flat\r\n\r\nwould  have been too costly, and so smaller flats were  designed\r\n\r\ninstead?   To  the extent that HDB policies are set during  boom\r\n\r\ntimes  and geared to rising prices, it is time that they be  re-evaluated in today's changed circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me just set the general environment\r\n\r\nbefore  I  go  into the specifics.

Secondly, the resale  prices  have\r\n\r\ndropped  by  27% since its peak in the fourth quarter  in  1996.\r\n\r\nThird,  the  resale market has been very active.  It  was  about\r\n\r\n40,000  in 1996-1997.  Last year, there were 65,000 transactions\r\n\r\nin  the  resale market.  Fourth, our CPF housing grant has  been\r\n\r\nvery  successful.   To date, we have disbursed  more  than  $1.3\r\n\r\nbillion  on  our  CPF housing grant.  So if  you  look  at  this\r\n\r\nbackdrop,  basically, the adjustments that we  see  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nsector can be understood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the implications? First, on the building\r\n\r\nprogramme,  Mr  Kenneth Chen asked what we  would  be  building.\r\n\r\nWith  the  waiting  list now more manageable, the  HDB  building\r\n\r\nprogramme will have to come down, but we will adjust it  gently.\r\n\r\nThe  building  programme  in 1998 was 28,650  units,  comprising\r\n\r\n22,000 flats in the non-mature estates, 6,000 flats for SERS and\r\n\r\n650 studio apartments for the elderly.  This year, HDB plans  to\r\n\r\nbuild  26,500  units, comprising 20,000 flats in the  non-mature\r\n\r\nestates.   So  it is only a reduction of 2,000  flats.   And  we\r\n\r\nintend  to keep the SERS programme at around 5,000-6,000  flats.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for the studio apartments, we hope the pilot  project\r\n\r\nwould  work  and  we  can continue to build  around  600  studio\r\n\r\napartments for the elderly.  Over the medium term, we would have\r\n\r\nto adjust the building programme in line with the waiting list.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On pricing, the principles on pricing new HDB flats remain\r\n\r\nthe  same.   Basically, we want to ensure  that  HDB  flats  are\r\n\r\naffordable to Singaporeans.  The benchmarks we use are that  90%\r\n\r\nof  Singaporean households will continue to be able to afford at\r\n\r\nleast  a  3-room  flat.  And 70% of Singaporean households  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to afford a 4-room flat.  Based on these affordability\r\n\r\nindices, we track the various sectors of the population to  make\r\n\r\nsure that the HDB flats continue to be affordable to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan asked what has happened to the new HDB\r\n\r\nflats now that resale prices have come down.  Basically, the HDB\r\n\r\nnew  flats  have  been adjusted downwards by between  5-8%  last\r\n\r\nyear.   We  did not follow the sharp drop in the resale  prices,\r\n\r\nbecause  the land that HDB buys is pegged to the resale  prices.\r\n\r\nSo  the  land  prices have come down from the Land Office.   The\r\n\r\nflat  prices  have not come down because previously  the  market\r\n\r\nsubsidy  was more than $100,000, which is out of sync  with  the\r\n\r\nCPF  housing grant.  If the CPF housing grant is around $35,000-$40,000, then the market subsidy for a new flat should be around $60,000-$80,000.  So the prices of the new HDB flats now reflect\r\n\r\nthis market subsidy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new HDB flats continue to be heavily subsidised, as we\r\n\r\nshow  in the HDB Annual Reports.  The overall sale proceeds  are\r\n\r\nnot sufficient to cover the total development cost and therefore\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  to fund the HDB for the  development  loss\r\n\r\nincurred by way of an annual grant.  In FY97-98, the deficit for\r\n\r\nthe sale of flats amounted to $591 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I think is different in this year's debate is the\r\n\r\neconomic  situation that we face and therefore what is  required\r\n\r\nof  us  is to have assistance schemes to help Singaporeans  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  downturn, and also MPs have requested flexibility  by\r\n\r\nHDB in administering existing policies, so that Singaporeans can\r\n\r\nbetter  deal  with  the downturn.  I hate to  be  glib  and  say\r\n\r\nflexibility is HDB's middle name.  But let me assure  the  House\r\n\r\nthat HDB will exercise flexibility as far as it can, so long  as\r\n\r\nbasic  principles  are not contravened.  Or that  in  exercising\r\n\r\nthis flexibility, we create more problems in the long run.  This\r\n\r\nis  one  of the basic problems of HDB.  The more flexibility  is\r\n\r\nexercised,  the  more complicated the rules.  I would  say  that\r\n\r\nexcept  for  the ethnic integration policy where  HDB  has  zero\r\n\r\nflexibility,  on everything else we will consider requests  from\r\n\r\nMPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first talk about the ethnic integration policy.\r\n\r\nThis was introduced in 1989.  When it was first implemented,  35\r\n\r\nor  28% out of 125 neighbourhoods in public housing estates  had\r\n\r\nreached at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nleast one of the ethnic limits.  After the implementation of the\r\n\r\npolicy, the ethnic balance in HDB estates has improved.   As  at\r\n\r\nFebruary  1999,  the number of neighbourhoods has  increased  to\r\n\r\n163,  but only 29 or 18% of the neighbourhoods have reached  one\r\n\r\nof  these  ethnic  limits, and therefore the ethnic  integration\r\n\r\npolicy   has   achieved  its  objective  in   promoting   racial\r\n\r\nintegration in public housing estates.  And I must tell you that\r\n\r\nwe have achieved this by having zero flexibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our neighbourhoods all come in diverse sizes. So I\r\n\r\nunderstand Dr Wang Kai Yuen's problems, but I am very  reluctant\r\n\r\nto  tinker  with  the  ethnic integration  policy  just  because\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods   are  smaller.   So,  other  than   the   ethnic\r\n\r\nintegration policy, everything else is flexible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to what we can be flexible. Mrs Lim Hwee\r\n\r\nHua  asked about valuation of flats.  The valuation is good  for\r\n\r\nthree  months, and with that 3-month period, most people  should\r\n\r\nbe  able to transact their resale flats.  Sometimes we do  allow\r\n\r\nextension of the valuation reports, but we do so carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are asked to sell their flats within six\r\n\r\nmonths,  she also asked whether we could extend it.  HDB usually\r\n\r\nexercises flexibility and allows the upgrader to sell beyond the\r\n\r\nsix months, giving a further extension of six months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On applicants who have sold their flats and are debarred\r\n\r\nfrom  rental  flats during the next 30 months, again,  HDB  will\r\n\r\nexercise   flexibility.   If  the  applicant  is  in   financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties, HDB will consider his case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen asked for the hand over date to be more\r\n\r\ncarefully  projected  and if possession is  taken  earlier  than\r\n\r\nscheduled,  that we allow the applicant to sell  his  flat  even\r\n\r\nthough the occupation period is not fulfilled.  Again, HDB  will\r\n\r\nexercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the set of questions on upgrading. Just\r\n\r\nto give Members the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noverall  framework,  when  we look at the  housing  estates,  we\r\n\r\ndevelop  an estate renewal strategy for each of the old  housing\r\n\r\nestates.   Three  of the main programmes in the  estate  renewal\r\n\r\nstrategy are the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme  (SERS),\r\n\r\nthe  Main  Upgrading  Scheme and the Interim  Upgrading  Scheme.\r\n\r\nWherever  possible,  we  will implement  the  Selective  En-bloc\r\n\r\nRedevelopment   Scheme,  but  it  must   be   economically   and\r\n\r\nfinancially viable, ie, the redevelopment potential must  be  at\r\n\r\nleast  twice  the  existing  output of  units,  because  we  are\r\n\r\nliterally tearing down the flats.  We are demolishing the  value\r\n\r\nof the units, and what we get is just land.  So the land must be\r\n\r\nable  to  yield at least twice the number of units to compensate\r\n\r\nfor the loss in the building cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the flats cannot be redeveloped and if they are old\r\n\r\nenough, we would undertake the Main Upgrading Programme, and  we\r\n\r\nundertake the Interim Upgrading Programme for the younger flats,\r\n\r\nas  a way of improving the estate before they are upgraded under\r\n\r\nthe  Main  Upgrading  Programme.  With that  framework,  I  hope\r\n\r\nMembers  can better understand how we select and how we identify\r\n\r\nprecincts for the different programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested that we raise the number of\r\n\r\nIUPs,  lower  the number of MUPs and keep SERS at 10  precincts.\r\n\r\nWe  intend  to  keep  SERS at 10 precincts per  year.   We  have\r\n\r\ndecided to reduce the MUP to five, and not to three, because  we\r\n\r\nwant a fair balance of upgrading between the older flats and the\r\n\r\nyounger  flats.   Mr Ang Mong Seng's proposal would  favour  the\r\n\r\nyounger  flats - 25 and only three for the older flats.  Keeping\r\n\r\nthe  MUP at five and the IUP at 18, I think it would give a fair\r\n\r\nbalance across the various ages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked why do we offer space adding item to\r\n\r\nthe  4-roomers and the 5-roomers.  I agree with him that  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  expensive, because we have to divert the services  and  it\r\n\r\ncosts a lot.  Because it is expensive, we do not encourage space\r\n\r\nadding item for 4-roomers and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n5-roomers  and,  therefore, we institute a  fairer  cost-sharing\r\n\r\nratio.   Therefore, it is entirely up to the  4-roomers  and  5-roomers  whether they consider it of value to  them  to  do  the\r\n\r\nspace  adding item.  If all the Members here feel that we should\r\n\r\nnot  offer  space adding item to 4-roomers and 5-roomers,  I  am\r\n\r\nprepared to be convinced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan Soon Bee asked us to review the MUP programme after\r\n\r\nsufficient  experience with it.  He requested  that  the  MP  be\r\n\r\nconsulted  on  the  demarcation of the precinct  boundaries.   I\r\n\r\nwould  assure him that we try to do so.  Sometimes the  precinct\r\n\r\nstraddles two RCs.  It is a toss up whether you fit the RCs with\r\n\r\nthe  precinct  boundaries which are physical and therefore  more\r\n\r\ninflexible, or you fit the physical boundaries of the  upgrading\r\n\r\nto  the RCs, which is whether you fit the hardware or you adjust\r\n\r\nthe  software.  I will leave it to the MP to decide.  If  indeed\r\n\r\nhis  RCs  are so stratified, then we will break up the  physical\r\n\r\nboundaries.   If not, I think it is better to have the  precinct\r\n\r\nforming a natural physical entity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan Soon Bee also asked that there be less repetition\r\n\r\nand  duplication  in  the covered linkways,  and  asked  HDB  to\r\n\r\ncoordinate.  I think we will try to do so.  But MPs play a  very\r\n\r\nimportant role, because the MPs are the advisers to the  working\r\n\r\ncommittees of each MUP precinct.  The MPs are also the  advisers\r\n\r\nto the Town Council which undertakes the IUP and also undertakes\r\n\r\nthe  CIPC  developments.  So, really, a lot of  coordination  is\r\n\r\ndone  on the ground, and not necessarily by the HDB itself.   So\r\n\r\nit  is  entirely up to the MPs how they coordinate the  walkways\r\n\r\nand the various developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker Sin Tze asked why there was no sale of shops since\r\n\r\n1998.   We  held  back  the sale of shops because  we  were  not\r\n\r\ncertain  how  the regional economic crisis would impact  on  the\r\n\r\nsale prices.  Now that the situation is more stabilised, we will\r\n\r\nlook into reactivating the sale of shops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan asked that rents be reduced back to the\r\n\r\nlevels of the 1990s.  If he says that we reduce the rent to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarket rent of the 1990s, I think there is a strong case for it.\r\n\r\nBut  I  suspect what he meant was the resettlement rent  of  the\r\n\r\n1990s.  Let me explain.  We have a very diverse group of tenants\r\n\r\nin  our  industrial shops.  Many of them are resettlement cases.\r\n\r\nSome  of them tender for the premises and pay market rent.   The\r\n\r\nresettlement cases could sometimes pay only 20-30% of the market\r\n\r\nrent.  We are now in the process of moving the resettlement rent\r\n\r\ncloser  to the market rent, and reducing the market rent to  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  market rent, which reflects 1993-1994  rents.   We  are\r\n\r\nindeed  moving towards the market rents of the 1990s.   But  for\r\n\r\nthe person who has been enjoying very low resettlement rent, his\r\n\r\nresettlement  rent in the 1990s was only 20-30%  of  the  market\r\n\r\nrent in the 1990s.  So he will see an increase in his individual\r\n\r\nrent.   But we will take a look into this and see how  we  could\r\n\r\nresolve this.  If the various associations are prepared to  have\r\n\r\nthe  1993 or 1994 market rent across the board, I will  be  very\r\n\r\nhappy to move everybody to that single rent.  That means we must\r\n\r\ncarry all the resettlement cases along.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan asked for the residential units above the\r\n\r\nshops  to be used for commercial uses.  My own personal view  is\r\n\r\nthat  this will complicate matters.  One of the problems we face\r\n\r\ntoday  is excess supply of commercial space, especially  in  the\r\n\r\nolder  estates.  The purchasing power in the older  estates  has\r\n\r\ndropped.   Younger families with bigger incomes have moved  out.\r\n\r\nThe shop space remains the same and therefore there is an excess\r\n\r\nin  shop  space and a reduction in demand.  If we now allow  the\r\n\r\nresidential units above the shops to be converted to shop space,\r\n\r\nit will worsen the supply situation.  So the approach to this is\r\n\r\nto restructure.  And when we redevelop, make sure the shop space\r\n\r\nis  commensurate  with  the purchasing power  of  the  immediate\r\n\r\ncatchment.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for flat design, I have no wish to go through the\r\n\r\ndetails.  I thank Members for their comments.  In fact, HDB  has\r\n\r\nscheduled a seminar together with all the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTown  Councils to pass all the design features and how they  may\r\n\r\ngive  rise to maintenance problems, security problems,  mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding   problems  and  noise.  We  will  leave  it   to   the\r\n\r\nprofessionals  to sit down and resolve this. What  it  shows  is\r\n\r\nthat there must be better institutional feedback between the HDB\r\n\r\nand  the Town Councils. We had that in the past when the  estate\r\n\r\nmanagement  was part of the HDB.  We have tried to put  in  this\r\n\r\nfeedback  loop, but obviously it can be improved.  So a  regular\r\n\r\nseminar  between the various groups would help  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, at present, applicants for\r\n\r\nHDB  rental flats have to wait no less than two to three  months\r\n\r\nfor  the  flat, depending on the availability, as the number  of\r\n\r\nrental  flats is limited.  However, during this time of economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  the  number of applications must  have  increased\r\n\r\nsignificantly, as is indicated by the increased number of people\r\n\r\nwho  have approached me during my meet-the-people session.  This\r\n\r\nmeans that the waiting list would be much longer.  As those  who\r\n\r\nrequire renting these flats are generally from the lower  income\r\n\r\nfamily  or individuals, the usual recommendation by the  HDB  is\r\n\r\nfor  them to rent a room from the private property or other  HDB\r\n\r\nflat owners would not help as even such rentals are beyond their\r\n\r\naffordability.   I  would  like  to  request  the  HDB  to  make\r\n\r\navailable  more  rental  flats at the present  time  to  provide\r\n\r\naccommodation for those who need rental flats at this  point  of\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Minister has promised to be more\r\n\r\nflexible  to those who encounter economic difficulties and  have\r\n\r\nto sell their flats and look for rental flats and overcome their\r\n\r\n30-month time bar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would also like to ask whether it is possible\r\n\r\nfor  the  Minister  to consider to have some  3-room  flats  for\r\n\r\nrental as some of those who need to rent flats have a family  of\r\n\r\nfour  to  five persons.  They could not possibly be packed  into\r\n\r\none or two room flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, since June 1994, the\r\n\r\nHDB started selling rental flats to tenants.  I would like to\r\n\r\nknow how many such flats have been sold to-date and where are\r\n\r\nthese flats located.  I would also like to know what are the\r\n\r\ncriteria for consideration under which these flats would be\r\n\r\nselected for sale to tenants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Sunday Times of 12th January 1999, Mr Matthias Yao\r\n\r\nwas quoted to have said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I applied for it and I was pushing for it. I am very happy\r\n\r\nthat  within a week of election results, the HDB has  agreed  to\r\n\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know from the Minister whether the sales of\r\n\r\nrental flats to tenants are also linked to election results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I request the HDB to sell the rental flats in Hougang\r\n\r\nConstituency  to  the tenants.  The blocks that  I  request  for\r\n\r\nconsideration are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Blocks 8, 9, 10 and 25, Hougang Avenue 3;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Block 313, Hougang Avenue 5; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Blocks 315 and 316, Hougang Avenue 7.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> The HDB studio apartment scheme is a new\r\n\r\nscheme  that was announced in November 1997, and subsequently  a\r\n\r\npilot project was launched in March last year.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister how well received the scheme has been; how  is\r\n\r\nthe  price  fixed,  and would it be lowered since  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket  has  declined substantially since the scheme  was  first\r\n\r\nannounced; and how many more studio apartments would be released\r\n\r\nin a year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> When the studio apartments for the\r\n\r\nelderly  project was announced, my constituency in Bedok  North,\r\n\r\nEast  Coast GRC, was selected as part of the pilot project.   As\r\n\r\nMr  Lew  has said, the project was successfully launched in  the\r\n\r\nlater part of 1997 and the response was good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the senior citizens in my ward applied to purchase\r\n\r\nthe apartment. The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscheme was attractive as they could sell their existing 3- or 4-room  HDB flats and buy these studio apartments, and yet  pocket\r\n\r\nthe  difference  in  price as cash to  see  them  through  their\r\n\r\nremaining years of life.  Depending on the size of these  studio\r\n\r\napartments,  the  prices range from about  $60,000  to  $85,000.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Sir, since the launch of this project some  16  months\r\n\r\nago,  the prices of their existing HDB homes had fallen by  some\r\n\r\n20%  to 30%.  Many of them now realise that they have less  cash\r\n\r\navailable to see them through their remaining years in life,  if\r\n\r\nthey  participate  in the scheme.  Many of the  senior  citizens\r\n\r\nhave  therefore approached me to appeal to the HDB to lower  the\r\n\r\nprices for the studio apartments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore seeking the Minister's approval to review\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  and to lower the prices for these studio apartments\r\n\r\non the grounds that, through no fault of their own, these senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  will  now have substantially less  cash  to  see  them\r\n\r\nthrough   their  life.   Unless  the  prices  of  these   studio\r\n\r\napartments are lowered by some 20% to 30%, many of these  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  may consider pulling out of the scheme.   I  therefore\r\n\r\nurge the Minister to consider their request and ensure that  the\r\n\r\nsuccess of the studio apartments for the elderly scheme stays.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, the proposal for studio apartments by\r\n\r\nthe  HDB is a timely solution towards elderly housing.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to make two suggestions to improve the proposed scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to suggest that HDB reconsider the\r\n\r\nconditions of sale that the studio apartment is only open to the\r\n\r\nHDB lessees who have lived in their flats for at least 10 years.\r\n\r\nIf the proposed scheme is to provide housing for the elderly, it\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  restrictive to the  potential  applicants.   An\r\n\r\nelderly  couple  who have lived with their children  in  private\r\n\r\nproperty may due to changing circumstances need accommodation of\r\n\r\ntheir  own.   If they so choose to apply for a studio apartment,\r\n\r\nwhy should they be denied just because they have not lived in  a\r\n\r\nHDB  flat before?  As the scheme is available to those  aged  55\r\n\r\nand above, it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunlikely  that those who need to apply for the studio  apartment\r\n\r\nare still drawing a large income, whether or not they have lived\r\n\r\nin a HDB flat before.  With little or no steady income, it would\r\n\r\nbe  unfair  to  deny such applicants who have a  real  need.   I\r\n\r\nsuggest we open up to anyone above the age of 55.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I refer to the condition that the owner will not\r\n\r\nbe able to sell the studio apartment in the resale market.  I am\r\n\r\nrecommending  that this condition be reviewed for the  following\r\n\r\nreasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This condition will restrict the mobility of the owner.\r\n\r\nSuppose that the owner's family has moved to another estate,  it\r\n\r\nwould  make  sense  for  him to sell his present  unit  and  buy\r\n\r\nanother  one  to be closer to his family. The current  condition\r\n\r\nentails  that the owner can only sell it back to the  HDB  which\r\n\r\nwill curtail the mobility of the owner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing the sale of the studio apartment in the resale\r\n\r\nmarket  will also provide an alternative to potential buyers  in\r\n\r\nthe  queue,  similar to the circumstances existing  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nresale market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the Government's move to encourage individual\r\n\r\nresponsibility  or retirement plans, the purchase  of  a  studio\r\n\r\napartment should also be considered as an investment rather than\r\n\r\na payment for old age accommodation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the studio apartment is a concept purely to satisfy old age\r\n\r\naccommodation, it might lead to the deepening of the connotation\r\n\r\nthat  the  studio apartment is an old-age home.  In this  light,\r\n\r\nstudio apartments might eventually become slums for the old.  We\r\n\r\nmust  not allow the studio apartments to become another form  of\r\n\r\nold-age home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the argument is to control speculation, although I do not\r\n\r\nthink that this will happen given the short tenure, then perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  condition could be amended to restrict the sale in the open\r\n\r\nmarket for the first three years of ownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, with increasing nuclearisation of\r\n\r\nfamilies  in  Singapore, the trend of older  persons  living  by\r\n\r\nthemselves will rise in tandem.  Within this group, over time, a\r\n\r\npossibly  significant  subset  could  be  households  which  are\r\n\r\nreduced to a widowed older person living alone, and who may  not\r\n\r\nbe able to get support from family members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In circumstances where this older person is unemployed, he, or\r\n\r\nmore  frequently she, may end up with a physical home but  cash-strapped.   By  definition,  she does  not  qualify  for  public\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feasible resolution to generating cash to meet living expenses\r\n\r\ncould be in the form of a reverse mortgage on her existing flat.\r\n\r\nThis  has  significant advantage over the options of downgrading\r\n\r\nto a smaller flat or queuing for a rental flat after selling off\r\n\r\nthe  existing  flat or buying a studio apartment  as  all  these\r\n\r\nthree options require a re-location.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, reverse mortgages exist only for private properties\r\n\r\nbut not for HDB flats.  Can the Minister explain the reasons for\r\n\r\nnot  allowing  reverse  mortgages on HDB flats,  and  would  the\r\n\r\nMinister review the situation, given the plight of this group of\r\n\r\nolder persons?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to take the two\r\n\r\ncuts together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the regional crisis has affected many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  especially  the  HDB  heartlanders.    With   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of CPF and pay cuts, some HDB dwellers  are  facing\r\n\r\ndifficulty in paying their rental or mortgage loan instalments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a caring Government, I understand the HDB has implemented a\r\n\r\nnumber of initiatives to help HDB dwellers.  I hope the Minister\r\n\r\ncan  clarify  the various assistance schemes available  for  the\r\n\r\nfollowing groups of affected residents:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Those who are in arrears in their rental or mortgage\r\n\r\npayments;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Those who would like to restructure their mortgage loan due\r\n\r\nto retrenchment or other reasons;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Those who would like to request for downgrading due to\r\n\r\naffordability problem; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Those who face problems paying the 20% deposit when taking\r\n\r\nover the flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Estate Renewal Strategy (ERS) was first announced\r\n\r\nin  1995 to rejuvenate older HDB estates to make them compatible\r\n\r\nto  newer  estates.   Under the ERS, Main and Interim  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgrammes  and  Selective  En-bloc  Redevelopment  Scheme  were\r\n\r\nimplemented in many constituencies.  Although MUPs and IUPs have\r\n\r\nmanaged   to   spruce  up  older  estates,  there  are   certain\r\n\r\nshortcomings:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Residents are inconvenienced during the construction\r\n\r\nperiod which normally lasts two years.  Dust, noise and security\r\n\r\nare key concerns of residents in these programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) MUPs and IUPs are sometimes unable to meet the needs of\r\n\r\nresidents,  especially in the provision of lifts  that  stop  at\r\n\r\nevery  floor and covered linkways.  Due to the design  of  these\r\n\r\nold flats (especially those with staggered corridors), it is not\r\n\r\neconomical and structurally possible to install lifts that  stop\r\n\r\nat  every  floor  or construct linkways which  can  benefit  all\r\n\r\nresidents  in these blocks.  This is a drastic setback  of  MUPs\r\n\r\nand IUPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) MUPs and IUPs are unable to intensify the land use of\r\n\r\nthese older estates which usually have large open spaces.   Many\r\n\r\nof these older flats are 10 to 12 storeys high, and thus deprive\r\n\r\nthe opportunity for higher density development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon feedback, the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment\r\n\r\nScheme  provides  a better alternative to rejuvenate  older  HDB\r\n\r\nestates.   Better quality and higher density flats can be  built\r\n\r\nto  maximise land use and provide better housing to Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwhile keeping the community intact.  However, to achieve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis,  there  must be adequate vacant land set  aside  for  such\r\n\r\nprogrammes when developing semi-mature estates or new towns.   I\r\n\r\nnotice  that not much vacant land was set aside in many estates.\r\n\r\nThus,  it  would  be  difficult for the Government  to  consider\r\n\r\nSelective En-bloc Redevelopment programmes in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to suggest the following for the\r\n\r\nMinistry to consider:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Increase the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Programme; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Set aside more land for future SERS in semi-mature estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Executive Condominiums were introduced at\r\n\r\nthe  height  of  the  property boom when the \"sandwiched\"  class\r\n\r\ncould  not  afford private apartments.  At the same  time,  they\r\n\r\nwere  not  qualified to apply for HDB flats or  Executive  flats\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  income  ceiling.  The  Executive  Condominiums\r\n\r\nserved  a  useful role at that time.  Since the decline  of  the\r\n\r\nprivate  residential  property market,  the  lower  end  of  the\r\n\r\nprivate  condominium  market  has  become  very  affordable  and\r\n\r\nalready  provides  the next logical level  of  upgrade  for  HDB\r\n\r\ndwellers.    Is   there   any  need  therefore   for   Executive\r\n\r\nCondominiums  today?   Besides, I believe  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  confine itself to providing basic housing for the masses\r\n\r\nand  leave the supply of the more up-market ones to the  private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister tell us whether there is a review of the\r\n\r\nrole of Executive Condominiums and, if so, whether there is  any\r\n\r\nplan to continue building such Executive Condominiums?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me thank Members for their\r\n\r\ncooperation.  We seem to be moving along now at a better speed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen asked about rental flat applications. Our\r\n\r\nstatistics  show  that  there  are  not  more  applicants   than\r\n\r\npreviously.   The  waiting list remains the same.   In  February\r\n\r\n1999,  the  waiting list was 1,331; February 1997 it was  1,341.\r\n\r\nHDB would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontinue to make rental flats easily available to applicants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen also mentioned that 3-room flats have not\r\n\r\nbeen provided as rental flats.  This has been so since 1982.   I\r\n\r\nwill  get  HDB to look into the possibility of reopening  3-room\r\n\r\nflats for rental applications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked for the criteria for sale of\r\n\r\nrental  flats to sitting tenants and he also requested  for  the\r\n\r\nsale of the rental flats in the various blocks in Hougang.   Let\r\n\r\nme  explain  the  sale  of  flats  to  sitting  tenants  scheme.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, it is to help those who are already renting flats  to\r\n\r\nhave  the opportunity to own the flats.  So it is our policy  to\r\n\r\nencourage  sitting tenants to buy over the flats that they  have\r\n\r\nbeen renting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong demand for rental flats in Hougang.\r\n\r\nThere are not very many rental flats in the area.  It is a  very\r\n\r\npopular  area  and therefore we have no plans  to  offer  rental\r\n\r\nblocks  in  the Hougang area for sale to the sitting tenants  at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture.  There is still more demand than available flats\r\n\r\nin the Hougang area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The studio apartment scheme for the elderly was announced\r\n\r\nin November 1997 as a new housing scheme to cater to the special\r\n\r\nneeds  of  our  senior citizens.  Elderly lessees  who  wish  to\r\n\r\nrealise  the appreciation in value of their existing  flats  can\r\n\r\nconsider  buying  a  studio apartment that is  purpose-built  to\r\n\r\nserve  their  needs.  The pilot project of the studio  apartment\r\n\r\nscheme  was  launched in March last year at four sites,  with  a\r\n\r\ntotal   of  650  studio  apartments.   The  response  has   been\r\n\r\nencouraging  and we have announced that we will  have  two  more\r\n\r\nsites  in  Bukit  Merah View and Toa Payoh Lorong  4.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  identify more sites if there is  demand  from  our\r\n\r\nelderly lessees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the MPs have made a strong case about the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  faced  by  their residents  in  purchasing  studio\r\n\r\napartments as resale prices of their existing flats have fallen.\r\n\r\nI  have  earlier  asked  HDB  to review  the  prices  of  studio\r\n\r\napartments to ensure that elderly lessees would still find them\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattractive.   I  am  now pleased to announce that  HDB  will  be\r\n\r\nreducing the selling prices of studio apartments by 25% for both\r\n\r\nthe  35-sq metre and the 45-sq metre apartments.  Before you all\r\n\r\nget  too  carried  away and argue for similar reduction  in  new\r\n\r\nflats,  let me explain why we are able to secure this  reduction\r\n\r\nafter very tough negotiation with the Chief Valuer and the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were able to do so because of the lower land prices on\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand, and also lower tender prices on the other  hand.\r\n\r\nThe  main source of savings is really from the lower land  rates\r\n\r\nwhich  have been given by the Chief Valuer and agreed to by  the\r\n\r\nLand  Office.  Why were we able to achieve this?  We argued that\r\n\r\nthe  studio apartments are sold under more restrictive terms and\r\n\r\nconditions compared to normal HDB flats.  For example, they  are\r\n\r\nsold on a 30-year lease compared to the 99-year lease for normal\r\n\r\nHDB  flats.  HDB also argued that there is no resale value.   Dr\r\n\r\nWan Soon Bee, please note.  Therefore, the studio apartments can\r\n\r\nonly  be sold to a small group of elderly buyers above 55  years\r\n\r\nold.   Furthermore, the studio apartments are located  on  small\r\n\r\nplots of land in built-up areas which are generally not suitable\r\n\r\nfor  more  comprehensive  development on  its  own.   Therefore,\r\n\r\ntaking  into  account all these factors, the  Chief  Valuer  has\r\n\r\nvalued the land prices for the studio apartments far lower  than\r\n\r\nthose for the normal HDB flats.  I have also mentioned that  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  costs  for  the studio  apartments  have  declined\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  adopted a more cost-effective  and  buildable\r\n\r\ndesign,  and also there is a general fall in HDB tender  prices.\r\n\r\nSo  we  are now able to sell the studio apartments with a  price\r\n\r\nreduction of 25%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the average selling price of the 35-sq metre apartments\r\n\r\nwill  now be $48,900 as compared to the estimated selling prices\r\n\r\nof  $65,700 in November 1997.  For the more popular 45-sq  metre\r\n\r\napartments,  the  average price is now $61,600,  which  is  some\r\n\r\n$20,000  cheaper than that announced previously.  We  hope  that\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreduction  in prices will make studio apartments more affordable\r\n\r\nto our elderly lessees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have earlier withdrawn their applications,\r\n\r\nthey  can request to reinstate their applications.  HDB will  be\r\n\r\nconducting the selection exercise for the pilot project soon and\r\n\r\nwe  expect  the studio apartments to be completed  by  the  year\r\n\r\n2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan Soon Bee made two suggestions. One, to relax the\r\n\r\ncondition  that  the applicant must live in  HDB  flats  for  10\r\n\r\nyears.   We put that condition in because we want to give  first\r\n\r\npriority to HDB lessees.  In subsequent phases, I think  we  can\r\n\r\nconsider relaxing this rule.  The second suggestion is to  allow\r\n\r\nresale.  For the reasons I have explained earlier, we prefer  to\r\n\r\nkeep the studio apartments with the no-resale condition, so that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no speculation and there is no bubble in  the  resale\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the studio apartments.  It is strictly  a  scheme  by\r\n\r\nwhich  you convert your present flat to a studio apartment  that\r\n\r\nwill last you for the rest of your life, and you make use of the\r\n\r\ncapital  gain  to  give you an annuity, and to look  after  your\r\n\r\nmedical expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same objective as what Mrs Lim Hwee Hua spoke\r\n\r\nabout  on the reverse mortgages.  We have done the sums  several\r\n\r\ntimes.   It is not as attractive.  Reverse mortgages are not  so\r\n\r\nattractive  in  the HDB context because of the restrictions  and\r\n\r\nthe  regulations that we have in place, making  HDB  flats  less\r\n\r\nmortgageable  to the banks.  We will monitor the market  to  see\r\n\r\nhow  effective  reverse  mortgages are  in  the  private  sector\r\n\r\nmarket.  And if we find that it is viable for the HDB sector, we\r\n\r\nwill consider the application in the HDB sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about the difficulties of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfacing  rental  arrears, rescheduling of loans, downgrading  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  20%  deposit.  Rental arrears,  we  will  manage  the\r\n\r\nproblem  compassionately.  We will allow  them  longer  time  to\r\n\r\nsettle  the arrears through an instalment programme.  The rental\r\n\r\narrears problem is not very significant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nLess  than  4%  of  our rental tenants fall into  three  months'\r\n\r\narrears or more.  Particularly over the last few years, with the\r\n\r\nvery  generous  rental rebates that the Government  dished  out,\r\n\r\nevery  time  we have a very high rental arrears, the  Government\r\n\r\nplays  Santa  Claus and the rents all get paid, and  the  rental\r\n\r\narrears problem was solved by itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rescheduling of loans, as we announced in November last\r\n\r\nyear,  we  have  five schemes by which Singaporeans  can  adjust\r\n\r\ntheir mortgage loans:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) They can reduce the monthly loan instalments for the\r\n\r\nfirst  five years to 75% of the normal amount.  This  is  called\r\n\r\nthe reduced repayment scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) They can reschedule the tenure of their loans to the\r\n\r\nmaximum repayment period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) They can defer payment of their monthly mortgage\r\n\r\ninstalments  for  six months if they face financial  difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf  necessary, HDB will extend the deferment period for  another\r\n\r\nsix months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) They can include more working family members as joint\r\n\r\nowners  so that the CPF monies can be used to settle the arrears\r\n\r\nand to service the monthly loan instalments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) They can pay their loan arrears by instalments over a\r\n\r\nperiod of six to 12 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we announced these in November, more than 8,000 HDB\r\n\r\nmortgagors have come on-board on these various schemes.  This is\r\n\r\na  very, very small percentage and therefore the problem is very\r\n\r\nmanageable.  The breakdown is that 5,800 have rescheduled  their\r\n\r\nmortgage  loan  payments through the reduced  repayment  scheme;\r\n\r\n1,200  have  extended their mortgage repayment  period;  another\r\n\r\n1,200  have  deferred the payment of their mortgage instalments;\r\n\r\n200  have  included  family members; and 300  are  currently  on\r\n\r\ninstalment plans to settle their arrears.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of downgrading, as we announced also in\r\n\r\nNovember  last year, applicants on our queue who find that  they\r\n\r\nnow cannot afford the flats that they have applied for, can come\r\n\r\nto  HDB  to  request  for  a  change in  their  flat  type,  ie,\r\n\r\ndowngrading  of  flat  type.  We will  consider  their  requests\r\n\r\nflexibly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 20% deposit, I am afraid we cannot exercise\r\n\r\nflexibility.   I think this is part of financial  prudence.   If\r\n\r\nyou  want  to upgrade and you want to buy a bigger flat,  please\r\n\r\npay up the 20% deposit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Estates Renewal Strategy (ERS), Dr Teo Ho Pin suggests\r\n\r\nthat  we  put in place vacant land so that we can have Selective\r\n\r\nEn-bloc Redevelopment in future.  I do not know what the  future\r\n\r\nwill look like in 20-30 years.  We have enough open space within\r\n\r\nour  existing  estates  that if we want  to  undertake  SERS  in\r\n\r\nfuture,  that can be done.  But I must tell you that  today  the\r\n\r\nHDB estates are built to quite high density.  Mr Low Thia Khiang\r\n\r\nhas already complained that you can fight across the blocks with\r\n\r\nbamboo  sticks.  If we build to any higher density, you  may  be\r\n\r\nable to fight across with broomsticks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau asked about the status of the Executive\r\n\r\nCondominiums.   I  agree with him that when the property  market\r\n\r\nwas  very  hot, the role of the Executive Condominiums was  very\r\n\r\nimportant and they came in very useful.  Now that the prices  of\r\n\r\nExecutive Condominiums are coming much closer to the low end  of\r\n\r\nprivate  property, the Government needs to review the  role  and\r\n\r\nthe  demand  for  Executive Condominiums.  As we have  announced\r\n\r\nearlier, we will take this review as part of the September  1999\r\n\r\ndecision on how much Executive Condominium land supply  we  will\r\n\r\nrelease for next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification from\r\n\r\nthe Minister?  I would like to know whether the sale of flats to\r\n\r\nsitting tenants scheme is linked to the level of support for the\r\n\r\nPAP and the election results.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> There is no linkage in the sale of flats\r\n\r\nto sitting tenants scheme to the level of electoral support.

So, wherever possible, we can\r\n\r\nmeet  the  demand we will sell the flats to the sitting tenants.\r\n\r\nBut if we sell all the rental flats to the sitting tenants, then\r\n\r\nwe  will not have enough flats for future allocation to those on\r\n\r\nthe waiting list.  So, unfortunately, the Hougang area is a very\r\n\r\npopular area, not Hougang in his constituency, but Hougang as  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  area  is a very popular area.  There is a long  waiting\r\n\r\nlist  and  we  do  not have such a big supply  of  rental  flats\r\n\r\ncompared to the central areas.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, since the Minister said that he\r\n\r\nwas  not  referring  to  my  constituency,  could  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  selling  the 3-room flats in my  constituency  to  the\r\n\r\nsitting tenants?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The history of HDB is that we built a\r\n\r\nlot  of rental flats in the early years and most of these  flats\r\n\r\nhappened  to  be  in  the central areas  in  the  older  housing\r\n\r\nestates, like Queenstown, Toa Payoh, etc.  Therefore, there  are\r\n\r\nmore  rental flats in these areas to be sold to sitting tenants.\r\n\r\nBy  the  time  we  moved up to Hougang area, we built  very  few\r\n\r\nrental  flats.  Therefore, there is a premium.  People  continue\r\n\r\nto  buy rental flats in the North East zone.  So we must keep  a\r\n\r\nsufficient supply of rental flats to meet the demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> You say it is not popular in Hougang.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I say it is very popular.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Not in my constituency?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Not in your constituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, town councils were introduced in\r\n\r\norder to help HDB\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhousing estate management.  It is a laudable objective,  and  it\r\n\r\nis  still  laudable.  But I would like to ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider changing the concept of the town council into  a  local\r\n\r\ncouncil  where  private  estates as  well  as  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board estates could be managed together.   We  could\r\n\r\ngo  one  step  further.   This town council  could  also  manage\r\n\r\nschools as well as recreational activities in the area.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  there  is  a clear segregation between  HDB  flats  and\r\n\r\nprivate  properties.   It  would be good  national  bonding  and\r\n\r\nintegration if both could come together.  As it is, I know  that\r\n\r\nsome  of  the private residents provide membership for the  town\r\n\r\ncouncil,  but  that  is not adequate.  We  should  go  one  step\r\n\r\nfurther.  I urge the Minister to seriously consider this.   This\r\n\r\nwill also lead to the growth of a civil society in Singapore and\r\n\r\npeople  from  the  private estates as well as  HDB  could  forge\r\n\r\ntogether a national consciousness on issues affecting them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Every year, the Government has set aside a\r\n\r\nhuge budget for the Main and Interim Upgrading Programmes of the\r\n\r\nHDB  estates.  For FY 1999 the amount is $413 million.   Private\r\n\r\nhousing  residents are feeling a bit left out in this  upgrading\r\n\r\nexercise.   Many feel that they pay high taxes.   Yet,  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to the provision of infrastructural services for  private\r\n\r\nhousing estates, they are asked to pay again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members examples of how residents feel about\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Government's role should be in this area.   First  is\r\n\r\nregarding  the re-laying of Singapore Power gas pipes.   As  you\r\n\r\nknow, we have been told that when the pipes reach about 25 years\r\n\r\nold, it is not safe to continue using these pipes.  They have to\r\n\r\nbe  abandoned and new pipes have to be re-laid if the  residents\r\n\r\nwant  to  continue using town gas.  Again, here, the  households\r\n\r\nhave  been  asked to pay a few thousand dollars.  Otherwise,  if\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  contribute their share, they would  have  to  use\r\n\r\nbottled gas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area is regarding cable TV. In many private\r\n\r\nhousing estates today, they have been told that if they want  to\r\n\r\nsubscribe  to  cable  TV, they are asked  again  to  pay  a  few\r\n\r\nthousand dollars.  For bungalows, it is as high as about $6,000.\r\n\r\nFor  smaller housing units, it is about $2,000 to $3,000.  Here,\r\n\r\nagain,  the  residents feel that this is really  infrastructural\r\n\r\nand  should  be  supported by the Government, if not  fully,  at\r\n\r\nleast partially.  So I hope the Minister will look again at this\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have a question on the status of\r\n\r\nthe  upgrading  of private estate policy that was announced  two\r\n\r\nyears ago.  I would like the Minister to clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> Sir, the Government announced a few years\r\n\r\nago  that they would implement an improvement scheme to  upgrade\r\n\r\nprivate  housing estates.  However, no concrete plans  had  been\r\n\r\nimplemented to-date.  In comparison to HDB estates where  a  lot\r\n\r\nof   resources  have  been  devoted  to  MUP,  IUP  and  general\r\n\r\nimprovement  works, private housing estates  have  been  grossly\r\n\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current budget, the Ministry's development budget is\r\n\r\nabout $2.61 billion of which $2.26 billion, that is, about 86.3%\r\n\r\nhas   been   allocated   to   public  housing.    Infrastructure\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in HDB estate alone accounts for $113 million.   In\r\n\r\norder  to  correct  the bias and shift the emphasis  to  a  more\r\n\r\nbalanced position, improvement works in private housing  estates\r\n\r\nshould  be carried out as soon as possible.  These will  include\r\n\r\nroad widening, more parks and improved sewage system, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the many problems raised by land property owners,\r\n\r\nthe  cost of sharing the laying of Singapore Cable Vision  cable\r\n\r\nto  private housing estates is a common concern.  In the case of\r\n\r\nHDB  estates, the laying of SCV cable is taken as infrastructure\r\n\r\nwork  and  the  cost  is  subsidised  by  the  Government.   HDB\r\n\r\nresidents need only to pay for internal connections within their\r\n\r\nflats.  However, private landed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproperty  owners  have to share the laying  cost.   In  general,\r\n\r\nowners  of  terrace and semi-detached houses will  have  to  pay\r\n\r\nabout $2,000 and bungalow owners have to pay about $6,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my house visit to residents in Charlton Park and Tai\r\n\r\nKeng  Gardens,  many residents asked whether the laying  of  SCV\r\n\r\ncable  could  be  taken as infrastructure work,  just  like  the\r\n\r\nlaying of electrical cables, water and gas pipes.  Although  the\r\n\r\nresidents  are aware that SCV is a private company  and  so  the\r\n\r\nlaying  of SCV cable is a private project, they take it that  it\r\n\r\nis  part  of the Government's efforts in achieving the  national\r\n\r\nobjective of promoting multi-media communications in future.  As\r\n\r\nsuch, their request is not totally without justification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the Ministry's expenditure on\r\n\r\nimprovement  works  in HDB estates is extremely  high  vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nimprovement  expenditure in private estates.  This  is  probably\r\n\r\ndue  to  the  limited scope of improvement works  which  can  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  by  the Government.  For instance, the  Government\r\n\r\ncannot spend money to improve any item within the boundary of  a\r\n\r\nprivate  property.  If this is so, then the laying of SCV  cable\r\n\r\nup  to the front gate of private houses can be considered as  an\r\n\r\ninfrastructure improvement item, just like connecting SCV  cable\r\n\r\nto   HDB  blocks.   I  would  therefore  urge  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\ncoordinate with the other relevant Ministries to see whether the\r\n\r\nlaying of SCV cable can be taken as an infrastructure item.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I\r\n\r\njoin them to find out the status of the upgrading programme  for\r\n\r\nprivate estates that the Minister has announced some years  ago.\r\n\r\nThose of us who come from constitutencies with large numbers  of\r\n\r\nprivate  estates  are consistently under pressure,  particularly\r\n\r\nafter  the introduction of Neighbourhood Committees (NCs)  where\r\n\r\nthey look forward to some form of upgrading programme for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I undertand that with the deficit budget, it will be\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  to  spend too much money  on  private  estates,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, I like to urge the Minister to consider starting a\r\n\r\npilot  programme for these private estates, especially now  that\r\n\r\nthe  costs  are much lower than before.  Secondly, the upgrading\r\n\r\nof private estates need not necessarily be as costly as those of\r\n\r\nthe  HDB estates.  What is really required is a coordination  of\r\n\r\nthe  various agencies - the PWD, the Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nand  maybe in some cases, the Ministry of Health - to help  look\r\n\r\nafter   the  environment,  coordinate  certain  works   in   the\r\n\r\nenvironment,  and that could go a long way and,  for  this,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  need not spend so much money.  But, where  possible,\r\n\r\nit   can   spend  money  to  upgrade  or  introduce   children's\r\n\r\nplaygrounds  and  so  on.   I  hope the  Ministry,  despite  the\r\n\r\ndifficult times, would consider some form of help and some  form\r\n\r\nof  coordination  of  these works so  that  the  private  estate\r\n\r\nresidents would also feel just as Singaporeans as HDB residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chairman:</b> We are running out of time. Can I urge\r\n\r\nMembers  to  be  brief  so that we can  get  a  reply  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  Mr Rai.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I will be brief, Sir. My other\r\n\r\ncolleagues have mentioned the question of cable vision.  I  will\r\n\r\nnot  touch  on  it.   I  will  just touch  on  the  question  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the private estates, like open drains. Mr  Koo  Tsai\r\n\r\nKee  was kind enough to send a note to me after the last  Budget\r\n\r\nsittings.   The  private home owners bear a  greater  burden  of\r\n\r\neconomic  sacrifice.  It is inequitable, because the  Government\r\n\r\nis subsidising HDB flat owners.  Here, all we are asking is very\r\n\r\nminimal,  like  the planting of trees.  I will give  a  case  in\r\n\r\npoint.   At St. Michael's Road, there is a block of condominiums\r\n\r\nthat has just come up.  The drain has been covered, but part  of\r\n\r\nit  is still open.  If people have to walk, they have to walk to\r\n\r\nthe  road  and come back.  For the older estates,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nworthy  of  Government support and I urge the Minister  to  give\r\n\r\nsome thought to this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> There is a tendency today for many\r\n\r\nGovernment contracts to be tendered out in large amounts of more\r\n\r\nthan $100 million.  This is disadvantageous to small and medium-sized  contractors  who  are mostly local.   The  big  lucrative\r\n\r\ncontracts  tend  to  be won by the foreign contractors  and  the\r\n\r\nlocal  contractors  then  become the sub-contractors.   In  this\r\n\r\nperiod of recession, there is an urgent need to assist our local\r\n\r\nindigenous contractors and help them to tide over this downturn.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  could  do this by tendering  out  contracts  in\r\n\r\nsmaller  amounts without sacrificing efficiency and lower  cost.\r\n\r\nI  hope  that the Minister will look into this with the  aim  of\r\n\r\ngiving  local  contractors  more  opportunities  to  tender  for\r\n\r\nGovernment projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Sir, I would like to declare my\r\n\r\ninterest.  My first point has been covered by Mr Lew Syn Pau  on\r\n\r\nchopping  up  the  size  of projects to allow  more  players  to\r\n\r\nsurvive in the market.  My second point is that the construction\r\n\r\nindustry  is currently very bad.  It is compounded by  the  pre-qualification  process  put up by some Government  agencies.   I\r\n\r\nwill quickly give two examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that the ENV Ministry has called for contractors to\r\n\r\npre-qualify for their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDeep  Tunnel  Sewerage System (DTSS).  But it sets a requirement\r\n\r\nthat  interested  contractors must have prior track  records  in\r\n\r\nthis  kind of work.  This is the first time we are building this\r\n\r\nsystem.   I  do  not  see  how  the  agency  can  expect   local\r\n\r\ncontractors  to  have  a  track  record,  and  if  none  of  the\r\n\r\ncontractors  can  participate, then the nation will  forever  be\r\n\r\ndenied of a chance in gaining the knowledge to do such work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the pre-qualification by PSA to build\r\n\r\nan   office  building  and  the  specification  says  that   the\r\n\r\ncontractors must have experience in design-and-build  on  office\r\n\r\nbuildings and this rules out a lot of contractors because  there\r\n\r\nare very few of these projects so far.  But if PSA says that the\r\n\r\ncontractors  must have design-and-build experience  and  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time have built some office buildings somewhere before  or\r\n\r\nmore  recently, you will still meet the requirement  of  getting\r\n\r\nthe correct capability to build and also the correct quality.  I\r\n\r\nthink it is important that all these things are taken care of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing I would like to ask the Minister is: under what\r\n\r\ncircumstances  are  the agencies allowed to  recall  design-and-build  tenders? It is very common for a team to put up a lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney in preparing a tender, and if a tender is called after the\r\n\r\ntender prices are published and all the designs are made public,\r\n\r\nthen the party calling the tender is effectively encouraging the\r\n\r\nparties to breach intellectual copyrights.  Unless the re-tender\r\n\r\nspecifications are substantially changed, I urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nensure  that  no design-and-build projects will be called  after\r\n\r\nthe  tender prices are published or their designs are being made\r\n\r\nknown to the public or contestants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, I will take less than one minute.\r\n\r\nOne  of  the  areas  most in need of regulatory  review  is  the\r\n\r\nexisting  building regulations.

As reported in the Straits  Times  on\r\n\r\n13th  January  1996,  I quote, \"It is raining  outside.   It  is\r\n\r\nleaking  inside many Singapore buildings and homes.\"  Over  half\r\n\r\nof  the buildings on the island leak.  Building defects such  as\r\n\r\nuneven  floor, leaky plumbing, seeping windows and  cracks  have\r\n\r\ncaused  much  inconvenience to many home owners.   It  has  also\r\n\r\nresulted  in  an  increase in the number of disputes  among  the\r\n\r\ndevelopers,  home buyers, consultants, contractors and  property\r\n\r\nmanagement  organisations.  Much time and  resources  have  been\r\n\r\nwasted in resolving these disputes which could have been avoided\r\n\r\nif  buildings are built to achieve a specified quality.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  make  the  following suggestions to  the  Ministry  to\r\n\r\nconsider:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) set up a knowledge base on building defects, repair\r\n\r\ntechniques  and good construction practices.  The  Building  and\r\n\r\nConstruction  Authority  can  work  with  our  universities   to\r\n\r\nspearhead research on building defects;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) provide a defect incentive sum, about 1% of contract sum in\r\n\r\nall  contracts, so that developers, consultants and  contractors\r\n\r\ncan  use  the  money provided to rectify the  defects.   Defects\r\n\r\ncould  be  due to poor specification by clients over  design  or\r\n\r\nshoddy  workmanship.  Any money saved from  this  sum  could  be\r\n\r\ndistributed among the developers, consultants and contractors;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) more warranty or insurance schemes should be provided to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  against  defects, especially  structural  and  water-proofing problems; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) exercise stringent control on imported materials and\r\n\r\ncomponents.  These materials must be tested in tropical  climate\r\n\r\nbefore  being implemented in buildings. Endorsement  by  PSB  or\r\n\r\nrelevant authorities will provide essential quality control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of ERP, it is now timely to consider the\r\n\r\nreduction  of car ownership cost for both private and commercial\r\n\r\nvehicle  owners.  Carpark fees, especially season  parking  fee,\r\n\r\ncan  be  a  burden  to many vehicle owners and companies.   Some\r\n\r\npeople  own cars out of necessity while others drive their  cars\r\n\r\nhome  to  save  transport  cost.  In the  present  crisis,  many\r\n\r\nvehicle  owners are feeling the strain to pay for  parking  fees\r\n\r\nboth within and outside the CBD.  Commercial vehicles pay a  few\r\n\r\nhundred dollars monthly for season parking while HDB flat owners\r\n\r\npay  between $55 and $75.  To alleviate the financial burden  of\r\n\r\nvehicle  owners,  I  would  like to propose  that  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  reducing  season and daily  carparking  fees  for  all\r\n\r\nvehicle owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Many of these management corporations of\r\n\r\nprivate  apartments and condominiums over the  years  have  been\r\n\r\nfacing  a  lot of problems with the property managers they  have\r\n\r\nappointed, because many of them are incompetent and they are not\r\n\r\nsuitable to run this kind of estate management.  The main reason\r\n\r\nis  that  there is no requirement for the licensing of  property\r\n\r\nmanagers by the Commissioner of Buildings.

So I am sure the\r\n\r\naspect of community bonding will progress along quite fine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the improvement of private estates, I want to assure the\r\n\r\nHouse that the Government has not forgotten its promise made  in\r\n\r\n1997.   But we are in the middle of a recession and we  have  to\r\n\r\nkeep  these items in view for a little longer.  But it  will  be\r\n\r\ndone, and it will be done well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the allocation of Government contracts, contrary to what Mr\r\n\r\nChuang  has  said, local contractors have done  very  well.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  I have looked at the figures. Local contractors have  won\r\n\r\nsomething like 60% or 70% of local contracts in terms of dollars\r\n\r\nand  in the HDB design-and-build contracts, 23 out of 25 design-and-build contracts were awarded to local contractors.   Whether\r\n\r\nwe  should  cut  down a big contract into smaller  portions  for\r\n\r\nlocal  contractors to bite on is something we have  to  look  at\r\n\r\nvery carefully.  There may not be economies of scale to bring  a\r\n\r\nbig project down to smaller projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On carparks, Dr Teo asked for reduction in fees. HDB has not\r\n\r\nincreased  HDB  and URA carpark fees since 1994 except  for  two\r\n\r\nareas, Kampong Glam and another\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narea.  And the reason is that HDB and URA carpark fees are still\r\n\r\nvery  low  compared  to private estates.  We  need  to  increase\r\n\r\ncarpark fees in the Kampong Glam area because there was  a  long\r\n\r\nqueue for limited carparks in that area.  In any case, URA  fees\r\n\r\nthere are much lower than the private carpark operators' fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Sinnakaruppan's point of licensing of property managers,\r\n\r\nlegislation  may  not  be  the  best  way  but  I  do  encourage\r\n\r\nmanagement  corporations to seek out competent and  professional\r\n\r\nmanaging agents.  I understand that APFM has been formed and  we\r\n\r\nencourage  MCs to approach APFM to propose some managing  agents\r\n\r\nfor management corporations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank Dr Toh for his suggestion on national parks.\r\n\r\nThat  was  a  tragic accident.

It\r\n\r\nwas  reported  that there was an outbreak of  this  new  disease\r\n\r\nknown as Japanese Encephalitis (JE) disease in Malaysia.  Why it\r\n\r\nconcerns us is that Malaysia is one of the main sources of  pork\r\n\r\nsupply  to  Singapore.  The second thing is that the  pigs  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia are imported live into Singapore.  They then go through\r\n\r\nthe  auction  house process before they are slaughtered  in  our\r\n\r\nlocal abattoir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask a few questions. First, could we\r\n\r\nensure  that  the live pigs which come to Singapore for  auction\r\n\r\nare 100% JE virus free?  If not, what precautions do we take  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the virus in the pig will not spread to our  fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?  Third, is there any case that the Minister  knows\r\n\r\nof  a Singaporean who has contracted such a disease?  Fourth, if\r\n\r\nwe  could  be  sure that the import of pigs are  100%  infection\r\n\r\nfree,  should we advise Singaporeans to reduce their consumption\r\n\r\nof  pork  and import less pigs during this highly JE  infectious\r\n\r\nperiod  or  divert our source of pig supply from other  sources,\r\n\r\nwhich  we believe it will be less likely to be affected  by  the\r\n\r\nvirus.   My last question: is pork from infected pigs  safe  for\r\n\r\nconsumption?  If it is not safe, then how could we be sure  that\r\n\r\nimported frozen pork is free from the virus?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, on behalf of the Minister, I want to\r\n\r\nassure the House and everybody in Singapore that eating pork  is\r\n\r\nvery safe.  In fact, tomorrow, I will invite my good friend,  Dr\r\n\r\nLow, to eat bak ku teh again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese Encephalitis (JE) disease is a viral disease\r\n\r\nwhich  is  spread  by  mosquitoes.  It is potentially  fatal  to\r\n\r\nhumans.   The  disease,  however, cannot be  contracted  through\r\n\r\nconsumption of pork, provided the pork is cooked.  So  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmosquito related problem, rather than a pig related problem.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, the pig is the carrier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department is taking all measures to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that mosquito breeding in the hog auction market  and\r\n\r\nthe  place where they load and unload pigs will be safe.  So  we\r\n\r\nwill  fog the place once a week.  We have been fogging the place\r\n\r\nonce  a week and we have been spraying insecticide twice a  day.\r\n\r\nWe  ensure  that  all  the operators there  will  be  vaccinated\r\n\r\nagainst JE.  Again, eating pork is safe.  Please carry on eating\r\n\r\npork.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, in my rush to answer some questions, I forgot\r\n\r\nto  answer  two  points  on  building regulations  and  building\r\n\r\ndefects.   On building regulations, we are not waiting  for  the\r\n\r\nBCA to be formed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIn fact, right now, BCD and CIDB are looking at ways to trim the\r\n\r\nregulations.  CIDB has commissioned a consultant's report a  few\r\n\r\nmonths  ago to make sure that our regulatory or compliance  cost\r\n\r\nis low.  In areas where we can trim the regulations, we would do\r\n\r\nso.   BCD is now looking at the new Building Control Act to make\r\n\r\nsure  that  the  building regulations are in  line  with  modern\r\n\r\nstandards, and unnecessary regulations will be discarded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to add that BCD has done very well, even though\r\n\r\nthere  is  a perception out there that BCD is the depository  of\r\n\r\nrules and regulations, and making construction cost high.   Over\r\n\r\nthe  years, BCD has made sure that planning approvals have  been\r\n\r\nspeeded up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On building defects, this is something that the management\r\n\r\ncorporations  must  sort out with the  developers.   If  we  ask\r\n\r\ndevelopers to deposit more money with the Government, then  this\r\n\r\ncost will be passed on to the home buyers.  It is true that  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  construction in Singapore can improve and  we  will\r\n\r\nwork on that.  We need the help of everybody, including SCAL.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Despite its small size,\r\n\r\nparks  and  gardens are provided amongst the urban developments.\r\n\r\nThese  green  lungs are an important part of the infrastructure,\r\n\r\nso  that Singaporeans  as urban dwellers have somewhere to go to\r\n\r\nenjoy  nature.   The popularity of most of the public  parks  is\r\n\r\ntestimony to the satisfaction of such a need.  However,  I  have\r\n\r\nobserved that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChinese  and  Japanese  Gardens are largely  under-utilised.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  this has to do with the entrance charges of  $4.50  for\r\n\r\nadults  and $2 for children.  For residents in the western  part\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, these gardens are one of the few which  they  can\r\n\r\nenjoy,  but having to pay an entrance fee to enjoy the parks  is\r\n\r\nsurely prohibitive.  Can Members imagine if the East Coast  Park\r\n\r\nand Pasir Ris Park also start to charge an entrance fee?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to suggest to the relevant authority to\r\n\r\nlook  into  transferring the privately-run Chinese and  Japanese\r\n\r\nGardens  to  the National Parks Board, rather than having  large\r\n\r\nand beautiful gardens open only to the paying few.  Why not make\r\n\r\nit  into a public park where everyone can enjoy?  As it  is,  we\r\n\r\nare  a small island state with little natural resources.  A park\r\n\r\nthat is under-utilised is surely a waste of limited resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I will forward the suggestion from Dr\r\n\r\nWan  to  JTC because the Chinese Garden and the Japanese  Garden\r\n\r\nare  currently  managed by the Singapore Leisure Industries  Pte\r\n\r\nLtd,  which  is a subsidiary of JTC.  The National  Parks  Board\r\n\r\nmanages  a wide variety of public parks to meet the recreational\r\n\r\nneeds  of all Singaporeans.  There is also a role for privately-run  parks  and  recreational facilities like the Mandai  Orchid\r\n\r\nGarden,  Haw  Par  Villa,  Japanese and  Chinese  Gardens.

What  this\r\n\r\nmeans  is  that over time, we have to nurture as many knowledge-based  companies  as  possible.  The  question  is:  what  is  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  company?  What kind  of  capabilities  will  be\r\n\r\nneeded for the knowledge-based companies to compete, and how can\r\n\r\nwe  create the environment so that more of these knowledge-based\r\n\r\ncompanies can emerge faster and sooner in Singapore's economy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, obviously, many of us will look at a knowledge-based\r\n\r\ncompany differently.  I would like to present one way of looking\r\n\r\nat  a knowledge-based company.  In the age of globalisation  and\r\n\r\ntechnology,  we will see keener competition in the market  place\r\n\r\nand  a  faster  pace  of technology evolution.   Knowledge-based\r\n\r\ncompanies must have at least two sets of capabilities,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  be able to cross two gates.  The first gate  that  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  company needs to cross  is  what  we  call  the\r\n\r\ntechnology gate, meaning that the company must have the  ability\r\n\r\neither to develop and to enhance technology, or at least  to  be\r\n\r\nable to access technology developed by somebody else, to be able\r\n\r\nto  apply  the  technology, so that it can cross the  technology\r\n\r\ngate.   But that is not enough, because at the end of  the  day,\r\n\r\nyou have to find customers in order to generate revenue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, companies will have to cross a second gate\r\n\r\nknown  as the market gate.  When we talk of the market gate,  it\r\n\r\ncould refer to new geographical markets or new customers in  the\r\n\r\nexisting  market,  or new customers through new  channels,  like\r\n\r\nCyberspace,  electronic  commerce  and  so  on.   This  means  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based company (KBC) must be able to know  how  to  use\r\n\r\nthe  technology and how to reach out to customers.  This is  the\r\n\r\nfirst set of capabilities needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is not good enough, because customers in the\r\n\r\nmarket  place do not buy technology.  They buy solutions,  which\r\n\r\nmeans  that  the  KBC must also have the capabilities  to  build\r\n\r\nbridges,  to bridge the gap between technology gate  and  market\r\n\r\ngate.   The first bridge that they have to build is a bridge  of\r\n\r\ninnovation,  the  ability  to transform  the  potential  in  the\r\n\r\ntechnology  into  new products, new services, new  applications,\r\n\r\nnew  processes and so on, something which the customers  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket place would find relevant and useful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even that is not good enough because customers do not buy\r\n\r\nideas.   They  buy physical goods or services.  So a  KBC  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  build  a  second bridge known as the  bridge  of  mass\r\n\r\ncustomisation,  which is very different from the industrial  age\r\n\r\nof  mass production.  Because in the case of mass production, we\r\n\r\ntalk   about  quality,  productivity.   In  the  case  of   mass\r\n\r\ncustomisation,  we talk about flexibility, adaptability  and  so\r\n\r\non.   These are the new capabilities that the KBC will  need  to\r\n\r\nbuild.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to go further to say that even this is\r\n\r\nnot  good enough.  Crossing the two gates and building  the  two\r\n\r\nbridges  is  not  good  enough,  because  in  a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy,  the  key resource is people, knowledge workers,  which\r\n\r\nmeans  a  KBC, in order to be able to get the best of  knowledge\r\n\r\nworkers,  must  have the two engines to drive its  growth.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  engine is what we call organisation development.  I refer\r\n\r\nto  the  ability  to create a culture, an environment  within  a\r\n\r\ncompany  so  as  to  be  able to bring  the  best  out  of  each\r\n\r\nindividual, not just in terms of knowledge and skills but  their\r\n\r\nattitude, their innovation, their creativity and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a spirit of entrepreneurship, which means that\r\n\r\nthey must be able to move fast, be able to look at opportunities\r\n\r\nand respond quickly, a kind of enterprising spirit.  All in all,\r\n\r\nSir, it is not easy to be a KBC.  It must be good in technology,\r\n\r\nmarket,    innovation,    mass    customisation,    organisation\r\n\r\ndevelopment, and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, from a national point of view, obviously, we\r\n\r\nhope that over time, we will be able to attract enough companies\r\n\r\nto  nurture  these  total capabilities in  Singapore.   This  is\r\n\r\nimportant  because  if we allow the KBE to  be  developed  in  a\r\n\r\nlopsided  manner,  then,  over  time,  we  are  going  to   have\r\n\r\ntremendous problems.  For example, not everybody can be good  in\r\n\r\nR&D.  Not everybody can be good in design and so on.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have to do is to create opportunities in all  the  six\r\n\r\nareas  so that every Singaporean can pursue career opportunities\r\n\r\naccording to their interests and capabilities.  But what we have\r\n\r\nto  recognise is that, from the KBC's point of view, there is no\r\n\r\nneed  for them to put all these total capabilities in Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause  they have the option of distributing these capabilities\r\n\r\nin  the  region  across  national  boundaries.   Therefore,  our\r\n\r\nchallenge is, firstly, how can we minimise the push factor  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  how  can  we  maximise  the  pull  factor,  so  that,\r\n\r\nhopefully, as many KBCs as possible will actually develop  these\r\n\r\ntotal capabilities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report is an excellent report and many issues have been\r\n\r\naddressed.   This  afternoon,  let  us  look  at  it  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  angle,  what Government  can  do  to  ensure  this\r\n\r\nbalanced development of total capability towards a KBE.  I  have\r\n\r\ntalked  about the need for the Government agencies to coordinate\r\n\r\nbetter  so  as  not to promote each individual  capabilities  in\r\n\r\nisolation.  Of  course,  the  first  step  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nagencies  have  to do is not to contradict each other  in  their\r\n\r\ninvestment  promotion but, more importantly, it is for  them  to\r\n\r\nreinforce  each  other,  so that when the  agencies  talk  to  a\r\n\r\ncompany,  they will be selling the company the message of  total\r\n\r\ncapability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned that some companies in Singapore have the\r\n\r\nwrong   impression  that  when  we  talk  about  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy, knowledge-based company, we are talking about giving up\r\n\r\nmanufacturing.  We are talking about going into design, into R&D\r\n\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  have heard companies telling NTUC that we are going to  close\r\n\r\ndown our plant in Singapore because in line with the call of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  move towards a knowledge-based economy,  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to upgrade our operation into a design centre or  an  R&D\r\n\r\ncentre.   So, closing down the factory in Singapore is  entirely\r\n\r\nin line with the Government's strategy.   And we have to explain\r\n\r\nto  them  and say, \"No.  When we talk about KBC, we are  talking\r\n\r\nabout  total capability.\"  I hope the Government can do more  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen that message.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a concrete thing the Government can do is to repackage\r\n\r\nall  the  incentive  schemes to give additional  incentives  for\r\n\r\ncompanies  that  are  able  to build that  total  capability  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Take, for example, is it not possible for us to come\r\n\r\nup  with  a  new  incentive scheme known  as  a  Knowledge-based\r\n\r\nCompanies  Incentive  Scheme  whereby  for  companies  that  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  invest in all six capabilities  in  Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nadopt  an incentive-plus approach, that is to say, they will  be\r\n\r\nable  to enjoy all incentives available to anybody else but,  on\r\n\r\ntop of that, a premium incentive to be given to them?  Is it not\r\n\r\npossible  for  all the economic agencies to adopt a  centralised\r\n\r\naccount  management  system to appoint  one  agency  to  be  the\r\n\r\naccount  manager to manage all these investments as  an  account\r\n\r\nand  to make sure that they would implement the six capabilities\r\n\r\ntogether?  Is it not possible for the economic agency to  set  a\r\n\r\ntarget  to form a knowledge-based company club in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nset  a target over the next two to five years and have 100, 500,\r\n\r\nor   1,000  KBCs  to  be  based  in  Singapore  with  the  total\r\n\r\ncapability?  Thank you, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, during the next three to five years\r\n\r\nof  the economic recovery phase in Singapore and the region,  it\r\n\r\nis important for us to monitor our business costs very carefully\r\n\r\nin  order to ensure that costs do not increase at such a rate as\r\n\r\nto render doing business in Singapore uncompetitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget debate, I mentioned the need to\r\n\r\nsystematically examine the regulatory environment to see  if  it\r\n\r\ncontributes to cost.  I would like to focus on the monitoring of\r\n\r\nbusiness cost in this speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tracking of business cost can be done at two levels.\r\n\r\nThe  first is direct feedback from companies.  Some of  this  is\r\n\r\nalready  occurring  and I am sure that MTI's  statutory  boards,\r\n\r\nnamely,  EDB,  TDB and JTC, do receive real time  feedback  from\r\n\r\ncompanies.   It  may be timely to formalise this practice.   One\r\n\r\nefficient and cost-effective way to do this is via the Internet,\r\n\r\nand  for  MTI  and  each of its statutory  boards  to  create  a\r\n\r\ndedicated  e-mail address each where business people can  e-mail\r\n\r\ntheir feedback to the Government.  The second type of monitoring\r\n\r\nshould  be  at the macro level by tracking Singapore's  business\r\n\r\ncost  vis-a-vis that of its competitors.  In my view,  there  is\r\n\r\nroom  for  improvement where our indices of cost competitiveness\r\n\r\nare concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is a unit business cost index of manufacturing\r\n\r\nbut  there is none for services.  Perhaps it is time to start  a\r\n\r\nunit business cost index for selected services sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the unit business cost index of manufacturing is\r\n\r\nbased  on  the  1988  input  structure.   I  am  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nindustrial structure has changed significantly over the last  10\r\n\r\nyears as to render an update timely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important question, however, is which countries\r\n\r\nare Singapore's major competitors in order that we can benchmark\r\n\r\nour  cost  against theirs.  The answer is not  too  obvious  and\r\n\r\nvaries  from  industry  to industry.  For  example,  Singapore's\r\n\r\nshare  of the electronic market in the US has dropped in  recent\r\n\r\nyears.   But  was this due to competition from the  US  or  from\r\n\r\ncompanies,  including  US  multi-nationals  located   in   third\r\n\r\ncountries,  which  are also selling their  products  in  the  US\r\n\r\nmarket?   In  other words, export destination may no  longer  be\r\n\r\nidentical  with the country which is the source of  competition.\r\n\r\nConversely,  Singapore's relative\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunit  labour cost in manufacturing vis-a-vis that of  the  other\r\n\r\nNIEs  was a key indicator used in determining the extent of  the\r\n\r\ntotal cut in wage cost needed last year.  There was a time  when\r\n\r\nour  major  competitors in manufacturing were indeed  the  other\r\n\r\nNIEs.   But  I  doubt if that is true today.  For example,  Hong\r\n\r\nKong has very little manufacturing left.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore think it would be timely for MTI to come up\r\n\r\nwith  new indicators to benchmark Singapore's cost in order that\r\n\r\nwe  can  carefully monitor our cost competitiveness in the  near\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, this is not a time to slow down,\r\n\r\nbut  rather we should speed up the regionalisation process.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  to  be  more accurate, we should encourage going  further\r\n\r\naway and encourage globalisation to diversify our risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good opportunities exist in the region and around the world\r\n\r\nand  Singapore  companies stand a good chance of  benefiting  by\r\n\r\ninvesting before the upturn comes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two possible ways in which Singapore companies\r\n\r\ncan globalise.  The first way is by complete replication, ie, by\r\n\r\nmoving  out  the whole operations from Singapore  resulting,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  in  the hollowing of our economy since all  the  value-added  activities will then occur outside the  country  and  the\r\n\r\nhost  country where these companies go to will benefit from  our\r\n\r\ninvestments  while  Singapore  loses  out  because  of  loss  of\r\n\r\ninvestment and loss of jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way is by breaking up the value chain of an\r\n\r\noperation  and keeping some value added activities in  Singapore\r\n\r\nso  that  this  still remains a centre where  funds,  trade  and\r\n\r\ntechnology flow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other issue is that currently offshore operations of\r\n\r\nSingapore companies cannot tap on the various incentive  schemes\r\n\r\noffered to companies located here.  We are talking about the  65\r\n\r\nor so schemes that are available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest a few things. First of all, can we\r\n\r\ndevise new initiatives\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  incentives  to encourage globalisation by breaking  up  the\r\n\r\nvalue  chains of operations so that Singapore still remains  the\r\n\r\ncentre  for  some  of its activities as opposed  to  encouraging\r\n\r\ncomplete move out of operations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can we allow companies that still keep part of\r\n\r\ntheir operations value in Singapore to be fully eligible for all\r\n\r\nthe  65  incentives instead of trying to devise new  schemes  to\r\n\r\nhelp such companies?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, provide new incentives to encourage mergers and\r\n\r\nacquisitions of viable companies in the region, since there  are\r\n\r\ngood  opportunities like the acquisition of a Thai bank  by  DBS\r\n\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, allow double tax deduction for costs related to\r\n\r\nglobalisation.   Some  of  these  are  the  relocation  cost  of\r\n\r\nemployees,  cost  of training of staff and the higher  insurance\r\n\r\ncost of having operations overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, to encourage individuals to globalise to allow\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax rebates for higher cost of  maintenance  of\r\n\r\nchildren, including education and the loss of spouse's income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to once again say that we have a very valuable\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  extend the second wing of our  economy  and  we\r\n\r\nshould motivate more companies to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, we all know that the domestic\r\n\r\neconomy  of  Singapore is by comparison small.  It is  therefore\r\n\r\nentirely  logical  for companies to grow  an  external  wing,  a\r\n\r\nprocess  which  has already begun and towards facilitating  this\r\n\r\nexpansion,  many  Government  agencies  have  provided  numerous\r\n\r\nassistance schemes.  The bulk of these schemes, however,  centre\r\n\r\non or favour greenfield or start-up operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may not always be the ideal route, particularly at\r\n\r\nthis  time  when opportunities may arise to acquire attractively\r\n\r\npriced and well managed businesses\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noutside Singapore, and the window may not be open for very long.\r\n\r\nAcquisitions  provide  sufficient  leverage  and   momentum   to\r\n\r\nSingapore  companies  venturing abroad, frequently  allowing  an\r\n\r\nimmediate penetration of other markets or securing expertise  to\r\n\r\ncomplement operations back here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister provide incentives for such acquisitions\r\n\r\nincluding perhaps extending similar tax concession to those  for\r\n\r\nnew businesses or capital?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, many of the points I want to speak,\r\n\r\nMr  Inderjit  Singh has already covered, but  I  have  just  one\r\n\r\nsuggestion.   Ministers go on official visits to many  countries\r\n\r\nand  I  think it would be useful if the Trade Development  Board\r\n\r\nworks  with the country whenever a Minister is visiting  another\r\n\r\ncountry  and  see what are the opportunities available  for  us.\r\n\r\nMany  people  feel  that we should wait. An entrepreneur  should\r\n\r\nlook  now  if  there is  an opportunity to go forward  into  the\r\n\r\nregion  itself.   As  cited by Mr Inderjit  Singh,  DBS  is  one\r\n\r\nclassic  example.  Many people think it is not a good investment\r\n\r\nbut  they  think  in the long term.  We must take  a  long  term\r\n\r\nstrategy.  If I could just give an example.  In India, there  is\r\n\r\na  community call Marwaris who come from Rajastan. They are  all\r\n\r\nover India and they are very successful.  We can be Marwaris  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, few Singaporeans fully understand the impact\r\n\r\nthe  World  Trade  Organisation has on our economy.   The  World\r\n\r\nTrade  regime is increasingly not only about trade.  It includes\r\n\r\nand  influences Singapore's domestic policies and laws  on  such\r\n\r\nmatters  as intellectual property, investment incentives,  rules\r\n\r\nfor   industry,  government  procurement  and  the  opening   of\r\n\r\nfinancial  services and other factors of our economy to  foreign\r\n\r\ncompetition.   In this, I believe Singapore has been  an  active\r\n\r\nparticipant in the WTO policy. In fact, we are perhaps among the\r\n\r\nchief  proponents of free trade.  Other countries, however,  may\r\n\r\nhave  doubts, especially in this time of crisis.   There  are  a\r\n\r\ngrowing  rumbles  of autarchy and narrow nationalism  among  our\r\n\r\nneighbours.  There are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome   who  wish  to  withdraw  from  the  global  markets   and\r\n\r\ninternational trade.  Such impulses would not be to our interest\r\n\r\nin  my  belief,  nor are they in the long term interest  of  our\r\n\r\nregion.   There are such implications for Singapore and I  would\r\n\r\nask the Minister to comment on two areas of trade policy and the\r\n\r\nWTO.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Singapore should continue to play a strong role in\r\n\r\nworking  with our ASEAN neighbours in initiatives  such  as  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  Free Trade Area.  In doing so, we will need to make  sure\r\n\r\nif  regional efforts are compatible with the WTO as  a  form  of\r\n\r\nopen  regionalisation  rather than closed  regionalisation.   We\r\n\r\nshould also assist our neighbours in making transitions to freer\r\n\r\ntrade.   This  is  especially  so for  newer  ASEAN  members  in\r\n\r\nIndochina.  In this regard, our Prime Minister made  a  call  at\r\n\r\nthe 1996 WTO Ministerial Meeting to give assistance to the least\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries.   I  would ask  the  Minister  what  steps\r\n\r\nSingapore has taken in this direction and whether consistent and\r\n\r\nsufficient assistance has been given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would ask the Minister to comment on newer issues\r\n\r\ncoming into the WTO.  This includes the connection between trade\r\n\r\nand  the protection of the environment as well as the connection\r\n\r\nbetween trade and the protection of labour rights.  These issues\r\n\r\nare  being put on the table by many developed countries  in  the\r\n\r\nwest,  including the USA, for the new so-called millennium round\r\n\r\nof  trade  negotiations.  Many developing countries,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  in our region, have been sceptical about the initiatives.\r\n\r\nThere  are  grounds, indeed, to believe that these are disguised\r\n\r\nattempts  at  protectionism.   We  should  guard  against   such\r\n\r\ndisguised  protectionism.   But, Sir,  I  ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider   that  Singapore  has  a  good  record  on  both   the\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  on  labour rights judged  against  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries.   In  this  sense, I would agree  we  have  to  guard\r\n\r\nagainst  protectionism.  But I would ask the  Minister  and  his\r\n\r\nMinistry  not  to  shy away from the valid  discussion  of  such\r\n\r\nissues.   I  believe that we should not be a nay  sayer  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming  rounds of negotiations whose only role is to  say  \"No\".\r\n\r\nTogether with others, I would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nencourage  Singapore and the Minister to engage with Europe  and\r\n\r\nthe USA on these issues to develop an international approach  in\r\n\r\nthe  WTO  that  is  fair  and agreeable to  both  developed  and\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries.  May I ask the Minister  to  outline  our\r\n\r\npolicy in these areas for the coming rounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the WTO and international trade are vital to\r\n\r\nSingapore's  present and future interest.  The WTO  is  a  rule-based regime that affords a degree of fairness amongst countries\r\n\r\nboth  big  and  small.  I hope the Minister will  elucidate  our\r\n\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, as I indicated during the Budget\r\n\r\ndebate,  I  would like to go into some detail as to how  we  can\r\n\r\npromote technopreneurship in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1998 World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Singapore\r\n\r\nsecond  after  USA  in  terms of overall  competitiveness  while\r\n\r\nTaiwan  ranked  16.  However, if we go into the details  in  the\r\n\r\narea  of entrepreneurship, Taiwan and Singapore switched  places\r\n\r\nwith  Taiwan ranking number 3 while Singapore ranked  number  17\r\n\r\nand  in  the  category of creation of companies,  Taiwan  ranked\r\n\r\nfourth while Singapore ranked 25th.  The USA ranked 1st in  this\r\n\r\ncategory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that we are losing the battle to be the Silicon\r\n\r\nValley  of  the  east and if we are serious about grooming  more\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs and entrepreneurs, we have to do a lot more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the experience of starting up two companies in\r\n\r\nthe last one year, one is a high-tech company and the other is a\r\n\r\ntrading business.  I have to admit that while the drive to be  a\r\n\r\ntechnopreneur  comes mostly from within you,  a  more  conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment could have facilitated things and make the  life  of\r\n\r\nan entrepreneur less stressful.  While I did not wait for things\r\n\r\nto  change to get started, I am hopeful that the path for future\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs  would  be better.  In my  case,  after  actively\r\n\r\nlooking for funds in Singapore and being unsuccessful, I had  to\r\n\r\nraise  about 70% of the funds from my company from overseas  and\r\n\r\nabout 60% of them come from Taiwan.  I also faced\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nobstacles  that  originated  from  our  multi-national   focused\r\n\r\neconomic  strategies and policies that are not friendly  towards\r\n\r\nlocal start-ups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the restrictive environment here, I almost agreed to\r\n\r\ntake on two opportunities, one in the USA in 1994 and another in\r\n\r\nTaiwan   in  1995  to  be  involved  in  starting  up  high-tech\r\n\r\ncompanies.  However, I decided to stay put in Singapore with the\r\n\r\nhope  of helping to change the environment here and also try  to\r\n\r\ninitiate  similar projects in Singapore.  Also, I felt  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  my duty to stay here.  However, I know of a number of cases\r\n\r\nof  capable  people  who  have left  Singapore  because  of  the\r\n\r\nrestrictive environment.  One is in Silicon Valley now  and  the\r\n\r\nother  who has started up an Internet-based company in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  very  discouraged by the lack of support and is  considering\r\n\r\nleaving for the USA.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we should do a lot more to create an\r\n\r\nenvironment that promotes technoprenuership and entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nwhich  our  current  Budget did not  address,  as  I  have  said\r\n\r\nearlier.  If  we start to do more now, can we then  achieve  our\r\n\r\nobjective of being the knowledge-based economy of the future and\r\n\r\navoid  losing our talented people to other countries  that  have\r\n\r\nmore vibrant KBE industries?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on my experience and observations, I would like to\r\n\r\nsuggest the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We need to set up a new EDB-style organisation that\r\n\r\nhas  a  full-time job of supporting entrepreneurs.   EDB's  main\r\n\r\nfocus is on MNCs and lately, I believe, PLEs have been added  to\r\n\r\ntheir list.  But no one takes a focused look at start-ups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The bankruptcy laws need to be amended. I think the\r\n\r\nMinister has already addressed this and I will not touch on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Government sets up a high-risk fund which they are\r\n\r\nprepared to lose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurs can borrow from this fund or make use of this fund\r\n\r\nfor  their start-ups and pay back if they are successful.   Even\r\n\r\nif  one in 10 of such projects makes it, the net loss to such  a\r\n\r\nfund  can  be quite minimal, because the returns from the  other\r\n\r\none out of 10 that is successful can be quite substantial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In the area of venture capitalists, I talked about the\r\n\r\nconservative nature of our VCs down here.  I think  we  need  to\r\n\r\ndevelop a more vibrant environment for such venture capitalists,\r\n\r\nlike  those that exist in the Silicon Valley in the USA  and  in\r\n\r\nTaiwan.  I would like to suggest the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Government should divide their current big funds in the\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked VCs (like Temasek Holdings)  to  many  smaller\r\n\r\nfunds and invite private sector businessmen and entrepreneurs to\r\n\r\nmanage  these funds.  Fund sizes could range between $30 million\r\n\r\nand $40 million.  We could start a pilot project with one or two\r\n\r\nof such funds and inviting some local businessmen to take on the\r\n\r\nchallenge of managing such funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Initially, until we can develop a vibrant environment for\r\n\r\nVCs,  I suggest that Government helps by providing a service  to\r\n\r\nlocate  VCs  from around the world and link them up  with  local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  until a natural network of VCs can  be  developed\r\n\r\ndown  here.  Basically, I am suggesting that the Government play\r\n\r\na match-making role to link the technopreneur to the fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Set up permanent industry groupings or committees of the\r\n\r\nvarious industry groups identified by the EDB in the Industry 21\r\n\r\nPlan.   Let each of these groups be under the leadership of  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  And each permanent grouping should have  full-time   staff  consisting  of  administrative  people   providing\r\n\r\nadministrative  support  as well as technical  people  from  the\r\n\r\nindustry who can come and work on a rotational basis to work  on\r\n\r\nkey ideas and joint projects, the results of which can be shared\r\n\r\nby the particular industry group members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) I feel that we need to have a good mix of people at the\r\n\r\npolicy-making  level in the Government and Government  agencies.\r\n\r\nWe  need  not  just academically smart people, but also  street-smart people, as I have said many times.  I suggest we seriously\r\n\r\nconsider  the  selection and promotion system in the  Government\r\n\r\nservice to include people with good experience on the ground  in\r\n\r\nthe industry.  One possibility is to co-opt people from industry\r\n\r\nfor  two  to three-year term into key positions where  decisions\r\n\r\nare made in supporting entrepreneurs and technopreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Modify the many Government schemes that we have today which\r\n\r\nrequire  you to spend your money upfront before you are  allowed\r\n\r\nto  claim  the  money  or  to  be  reimbursed  later  on.   Such\r\n\r\ntechnological type of companies typically require a lot of  cash\r\n\r\noutlay  in  the beginning and cash flow problem  can  be  a  big\r\n\r\nheadache  for  entrepreneurs.  So if some of these  schemes  can\r\n\r\nallow upfront funding, it will help us quite tremendously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Finally, we need to be very serious about promoting\r\n\r\n'cottage  industries'.   The  Prime Minister  talked  about  the\r\n\r\npossibility of using HDB homes for some of these light  industry\r\n\r\ntypes,  those  that use the computer, knowledge based,  software\r\n\r\ndevelopment  type of companies.  I think we need  to  amend  our\r\n\r\ncompany  laws that can promote such cottage industries.   If  we\r\n\r\nstart  with cottage industries today, I think this will lead  to\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs and technopreneurs emerging five to 10 years  down\r\n\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Shanmugam is not here.

Among others are: (1) the lack of support  and\r\n\r\nmarket;  (2)  it  is  expensive  to  start  a  new  business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore;  (3)  too  many rules and regulations;  (4)  problems\r\n\r\ngetting  loans from local banks; (5) not many people wanting  to\r\n\r\nwork on new ventures\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  local  companies;  and (6) Government incentives  which  are\r\n\r\ngenerally  not  targeted towards new ventures like  these.   And\r\n\r\nmost  people rely on their savings or family support  system  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them,  and  on  their own, with plenty  of  guts  and  big\r\n\r\nappetite for risk-taking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, for example, there is a very strong and well-developed venture capital market. They are on the look out for\r\n\r\ngood  bright ideas.  In fact, it is possible to make  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney just selling ideas in the US.  Here, more often than  not,\r\n\r\nit  is  not  worth anything.  In the US, there is  also  a  very\r\n\r\nstrong culture among major corporations to outsource portions of\r\n\r\ntheir  business  to their employees who then,  in  turn,  become\r\n\r\nindependent contractors or consultants, service providers to the\r\n\r\ncompany.   This  will  help ease the  burden  of  entry.   These\r\n\r\ncompanies  can then leverage on the infrastructure  provided  by\r\n\r\nthese  major corporations.  In Singapore, sadly, we do not  have\r\n\r\nsuch a culture or practice here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am very happy to note that there are new initiatives\r\n\r\nbeing  announced  earlier to help, and I  am  referring  to  the\r\n\r\nCommittee to promote technopreneurs and the changes in  the  law\r\n\r\non  bankruptcy, I would like to propose to the Minister that  we\r\n\r\nset  up a one-stop business centre for budding entrepreneurs  to\r\n\r\nhelp them overcome some of these problems that we have mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier.   It  can be a place where they can all  meet  together\r\n\r\nwith  one  another.  Because for entrepreneurs like these,  they\r\n\r\nneed  a whole host of people, network, in order to work together\r\n\r\nto  synergise and compete with major corporations like  GLCs  or\r\n\r\nMNCs.   But  now  they  have  to make  multiple  trips  to  many\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments to get their businesses  registered  and\r\n\r\ngoing,  from  EDB  to  TDB, to PSB, and a  host  of  many  other\r\n\r\nlicensing  agencies, just to get their businesses going.   Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  other legal, financial and secretarial services  that\r\n\r\nare  essential  to  start and run a business, the  centre  could\r\n\r\nserve  as  a  place  where they can get  information  and  other\r\n\r\nadministrative  service from the Government,  for  example,  all\r\n\r\nunder one roof.  They can also share cost.  For\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexample,  a centre like this where they can share administrative\r\n\r\ncost  of  rental, which is very expensive, and other secretarial\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, I think it will help lower the start-up costs\r\n\r\nand  barriers of entry for these entrepreneurs.  And  I  hope  a\r\n\r\ncentre like this, if properly done, can also help symbolise  the\r\n\r\nstrong  support and importance that Singapore gives  to  budding\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Leong is not here. Mr Inderjit Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the strategy of bringing in foreign\r\n\r\ndirect  investment  with a focus on big multinational  companies\r\n\r\nhas  worked  very well for Singapore in the past 30 years.   But\r\n\r\nlooking  ahead,  I  believe the strategy is not  going  to  work\r\n\r\nbecause the value that Singapore provided for such investors  in\r\n\r\nthe  past can now easily be duplicated or improved upon by other\r\n\r\ncountries in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned before, in the USA, one new company is started\r\n\r\nevery  3.5  seconds  and  again  in  the  World  Competitiveness\r\n\r\nYearbook,  ranking on Creation of Firms, USA ranked  number  one\r\n\r\nwhile Singapore ranked 25th; Taiwan was fourth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we set the objectives like bringing in $7-$8 billion of\r\n\r\ninvestments in a year, I can understand that it is very easy for\r\n\r\nthe  agencies who have to work on such targets to attract a  few\r\n\r\nbig  projects, which bring in big dollar amounts and huge chunks\r\n\r\nof jobs each time.  It is tougher and troublesome to attract the\r\n\r\nsame  dollar levels by working on, say, 10 to 20 times  more  of\r\n\r\nSMEs.   Therefore, agencies, like EDB, prefer to focus on  these\r\n\r\nbig companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should in the next 10 to 15 years focus on making the SMEs\r\n\r\nthe  cornerstone for the growth of our economy, with  particular\r\n\r\nfocus on KBE type of industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many SMEs feel that the existing mindset among the various\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagencies  is that SMEs are always asking for help.  The  mindset\r\n\r\nneeds  to change so that these agencies and the Government  feel\r\n\r\nthat they need SMEs' help for the economy to grow.  The attitude\r\n\r\namong  some  agencies is also to prefer MNCs to local  companies\r\n\r\neven if they bring in the same amount of investment.  In fact, I\r\n\r\nhave  experienced this personally.  I am trying to start  up  my\r\n\r\ncompany with an investment that is bigger than some of the  MNCs\r\n\r\nbut we face some problems and issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit squeeze is a big problem because banks continue to adopt\r\n\r\na very conservative stance.  The 65 or so incentive schemes that\r\n\r\nexist are a big help, but the ability to complete an application\r\n\r\nform for some of the SMEs is still a concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to add that so far the\r\n\r\nProductivity and Standards Board (PSB) has done an excellent job\r\n\r\nin trying to meet the demands, but without additional resources,\r\n\r\ntheir ability to reach out to more companies is limited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the following suggestions for the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Again, for SMEs to set up a focused agency to support them.\r\n\r\nThe  current `First Stop Centre' (not One-Stop Centre), has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able to help effectively due to its lack of resources  and\r\n\r\nestablished  roles.  In the one-stop centre, the companies  that\r\n\r\napply  for help are then directed to many agencies, and  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of going from one agency to another, they get lost  and\r\n\r\nthey give up trying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Perhaps we can farm out some of the activities like the\r\n\r\nprocessing  roles  for  some of the  incentive  schemes  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious  industry associations like the Singapore  Confederation\r\n\r\nof  Industries  and the ASME (Association of  Small  and  Medium\r\n\r\nEnterprises).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Of course, the various industry associations too need to\r\n\r\nplay  their  part in helping themselves by attracting  more  and\r\n\r\nbigger  members  to join them.  Industry players  need  to  also\r\n\r\nbecome  more  committed  to  work  through  these  associations,\r\n\r\nbecause these are useful organisations through which they can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nachieve many of their objectives.  Currently, the Association of\r\n\r\nSmall and Medium Enterprises has only 380 members while SCI  has\r\n\r\nabout 1,000-plus members, whereas I believe that there are about\r\n\r\n100,000  or  so  SMEs  in Singapore.  So I think  they  are  not\r\n\r\ncurrently exactly representing all the SMEs in Singapore.  I  am\r\n\r\ntalking  about the two associations.  But once this can  happen,\r\n\r\nwhen  more industry players can join these organisations and  be\r\n\r\nmore  committed  to help themselves, perhaps the Government  can\r\n\r\nprovide  funding for these associations to play  their  extended\r\n\r\nroles  in helping to disburse the various schemes.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthe more successful association members could be mentors for the\r\n\r\nsmaller  players.  Once the industrialists can prove  that  they\r\n\r\ncan  be  a significant force and behave as such, I am sure  they\r\n\r\nwill be given more attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The LEFS scheme is great, but the interest rates are still\r\n\r\npegged  at  6.25%,  which  did not  change  despite  the  market\r\n\r\ninterest  rates coming down.  Can I ask the Government  if  they\r\n\r\ncan  half  this  rate?   Can Government agencies  also  be  more\r\n\r\ninvolved in approving loans rather than depending just on banks?\r\n\r\nDespite  the  boost to the LEFS scheme in June last  year,  many\r\n\r\ncompanies  are still facing difficulties in getting their  loans\r\n\r\napproved  because of the conservative nature of the  banks.   We\r\n\r\nmay  want  to  set up a joint body consisting of  PSB  and  bank\r\n\r\nofficers  to  act  as  loan approving  bodies.   Also,  can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment increase the share of risk to encourage banks  to  do\r\n\r\nmore in lending the money?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Can we extend the SDF funds for executive and managerial\r\n\r\ntraining  so that SMEs can take advantage of this down cycle  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  staff,  and not just  focus  on  the  lower  end\r\n\r\nemployees?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, to the credit of EDB and PSB, many\r\n\r\nschemes  have  been put in place to assist SMEs.   Although  the\r\n\r\nintention  is  noble,  the potential may  not  have  been  fully\r\n\r\nrealised.   Based on feedback gathered by the GPC, the following\r\n\r\nreasons were cited:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as Mr Singh has touched on briefly, the application\r\n\r\nprocess  is  frequently too bureaucratic and long  drawn.   Many\r\n\r\nSMEs  simply do not have the resources to devote solely  to  the\r\n\r\napplication  for assistance.  And many fail to apply,  not  from\r\n\r\nwant  of effort or interest, but from a lack of ability to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  rigours of the process.  This difficulty  is  further\r\n\r\ncomplicated  by  the relatively high turnover of  public  sector\r\n\r\nstaff   handling  the  applications.   Towards  addressing   the\r\n\r\nfrustration  of  the SMEs so described, can the Minister  review\r\n\r\nthe  application process with the aim of making it a simple  and\r\n\r\nstraightforward experience?  In addition, can such assistance be\r\n\r\ngranted in a timely fashion?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, LEFS currently works on a fixed interest rate\r\n\r\nstructure,  as  also  referred to by Mr  Singh,  purportedly  to\r\n\r\nprovide  some  certainty  to  interest  liabilities  for   SMEs.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the interest rate has been fixed at a level that  does\r\n\r\nnot  sit  well  with  the  current  low  interest  rates.   This\r\n\r\nunfortunately  detracts  from the benefits  of  LEFS.   Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  explain the method for determining this fixed interest\r\n\r\nrate  and  explore  the  possibility  of  a  cheaper  source  of\r\n\r\nfinancing?   Can  flexibility be exercised to  adjust  rates  to\r\n\r\nreflect more closely prevailing market trends?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, the point that I would like to raise has\r\n\r\nbeen  adequately  covered  by  the  speakers  preceding  me,  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.  So I just want to join  in\r\n\r\nby   urging  the  Government  to  evaluate  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nestablishing  a single agency to provide greater leadership  and\r\n\r\nsharper focus in our attempt to help the SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, with more than 92,000\r\n\r\nlocal  SMEs  employing 583,000 workers or 52% of the  workforce,\r\n\r\nSMEs  undoubtedly  represent an integral part of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.   The  phenomenal changes afflicting the  regional  and\r\n\r\nglobal  economy, coupled with the onset of the financial  crisis\r\n\r\nin  mid-1997, are having profound implications in the manner how\r\n\r\nour SMEs conduct their business.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the timing should be appropriate now to undertake\r\n\r\na   critical   review   and  revamp  of   the   SME   Masterplan\r\n\r\nconceptualised about 10 years ago to accommodate  the  multitude\r\n\r\nof  changes in the local and global business environment  within\r\n\r\nwhich  our SMEs operate.  We must ensure that our SMEs are  able\r\n\r\nto  grow  and  thrive  in an increasingly  complex  environment.\r\n\r\nShort and long term strategies need to be reviewed to ensure the\r\n\r\nsurvival  ability  at  a time when we are  actively  pursuing  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest the incorporation of the following, among others, as\r\n\r\nand when a review of the SME Masterplan is undertaken:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Create an enterprise restructuring scheme aimed at\r\n\r\nfacilitating  and clustering of SMEs in specific  industries  to\r\n\r\nmake them more competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Promote banding together of SMEs to reduce overheads and\r\n\r\noperating  cost.  Such business alliances will also  enable  our\r\n\r\nSMEs to share knowledge, expertise and experiences and encourage\r\n\r\nresource   sharing  among  them  in  the  international   market\r\n\r\ndevelopment efforts and venturing overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Expand the network of participating financial institutions\r\n\r\n(PFIs)  in the LEFS scheme so that risk sharing is spread  to  a\r\n\r\nwider network of participants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Facilitate the matching of venture capital with promising\r\n\r\nand innovative SMEs to enable them to grow faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Review and redesign tax laws and incentive programmes to\r\n\r\npromote  and encourage foreign investments and capital  infusion\r\n\r\ninto our SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Encourage the spirit of continuous value creation among SMEs\r\n\r\nto  stay  competitive  in  the longer term.   This  entails  the\r\n\r\nacquisition  and employment of the latest technology,  equipment\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninformation  technology  to enable them to  effectively  improve\r\n\r\nproducts and service quality and manage their supply change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Conduct regular training to enable our SMEs to confidently\r\n\r\nconnect with the globalised world to accelerate their growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Sir, the Finance Minister in his Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  said that \"our approach to current economic  problems\r\n\r\nis  to monitor developments closely and respond with measures to\r\n\r\nmaintain  the  competitiveness of our economy  relative  to  our\r\n\r\nexport competitors.\"  I think this is very important and I  wish\r\n\r\nto  know if the Ministry intends to put in place a mechanism  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  the  impact of the cost cutting measures,  gauge  their\r\n\r\neffectiveness,  fine-tune their implementation and  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  desired effect of those measures is filtered throughout all\r\n\r\nsectors of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite alarming to learn that NTUC Secretary-General,\r\n\r\nMr  Lim  Boon  Heng, expects 1999 will see 20,000  people  being\r\n\r\nretrenched.  If, despite the Government's best efforts to revive\r\n\r\nthe  economy, jobs continue to be lost due to lack  of  external\r\n\r\ndemand,  loss  of competitiveness and cash flow  problems,  will\r\n\r\nthere  be  any  contingency measures put in place this  year  to\r\n\r\nminimise unemployment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of SMEs, many of them are now doing their best\r\n\r\nto  overcome the economic difficulties in a positive  way.   One\r\n\r\npositive finding that emerged from the pre-Budget survey on  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  local enterprises which Singapore Chinese Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry  conducted  in  February  was  the  keen\r\n\r\ninterest  of  SMEs  to  make incursions into  new  and  emerging\r\n\r\nmarkets.   They  are  keen to diversify their  market  base  and\r\n\r\nsource  for new products.  Obviously, the Asian economic  crisis\r\n\r\nhas  awakened  the need for SMEs in Singapore, formerly  content\r\n\r\nwith trading or doing businesses with a few traditional markets,\r\n\r\nto spread the net wider and broaden their markets.  Indeed, many\r\n\r\nSMEs  are  now acutely aware that relying on a few core  markets\r\n\r\nexposes themselves to undue risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies having business dealings with United States and\r\n\r\nEurope,  for  instance,  remain  largely  unaffected  from   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  woes.   There  are  nascent  opportunities  in  other\r\n\r\nemerging  markets  around the world which  should  be  explored.\r\n\r\nWhile  such opportunities are being identified through the  many\r\n\r\ntrade  missions  which the Trade Development  Board  intends  to\r\n\r\nlaunch  this year to such markets, such as Middle East,  Mexico,\r\n\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe and South Asia, we believe these  may\r\n\r\nstill be beyond the means of the majority of SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to impress upon the Ministry the need to\r\n\r\ndesign  a  fresh  set  of pragmatic initiatives  or  schemes  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  SMEs  in  making  that  critical  step  towards  new\r\n\r\nmarkets.   Extraordinary circumstances created by this  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis demand creative solutions to buffer the negative effects.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the  suggestions that our SMEs hope that the  Ministry\r\n\r\ncould  consider  implementing  to facilitate  their  entry  into\r\n\r\nventures in the new markets include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Providing more Government subsidies for participation in\r\n\r\ninternational missions, fairs and exhibitions;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Extending more assistance to SMEs through the overseas\r\n\r\nTDB  network,  like  making introductions to potential  business\r\n\r\npartners  and  helping  them  with  the  cultural  and  language\r\n\r\nbarriers where necessary;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Providing more financial and tax incentives for their\r\n\r\noverseas marketing efforts; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Implementing an export credit guarantee scheme for\r\n\r\nSMEs, similar to that extended to SMEs in South Korea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there are currently a number of assistance schemes\r\n\r\nwhich  are open to local enterprises, these schemes will benefit\r\n\r\ncompanies  which  are  already  well-established  and  have  the\r\n\r\nnecessary    overseas   connections.     For    instance,    the\r\n\r\nRegionalisation Finance Scheme provides loans to  companies  for\r\n\r\nthe acquisition of fixed assets overseas.  This scheme\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  applicable  to the trading  community.   Another\r\n\r\nscheme, the Business Development Scheme, apparently applies only\r\n\r\nto  missions or projects undertaken on a group basis endorsed by\r\n\r\nthe PSB.  Although we appreciate the efforts to expand the Trade\r\n\r\nDevelopment Incentive scheme to assist companies in  setting  up\r\n\r\noverseas   marketing  office  and  other  business   development\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  such as branding, franchising and licensing,  these\r\n\r\nschemes   clearly  benefit  only  those  companies  which   have\r\n\r\nestablished their contacts abroad and are ready to venture  into\r\n\r\nthe next stage of business development.  These preclude the SMEs\r\n\r\nwhich  wish  to  explore  new markets who  neither  possess  the\r\n\r\nfinancial means nor the right contacts to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do hope that the blueprint for Singapore to develop\r\n\r\nworld-class  SMEs  in  the  next  century  will  scrutinise  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of SMEs and design pragmatic schemes to bring  them\r\n\r\ninto that league.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, I am delighted that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  aims  to  produce  a pool  of  100  Promising  Local\r\n\r\nEnterprises (PLEs) with a turnover of $100 million each  by  the\r\n\r\nyear  2005.   But, Sir, six to seven years is a short  time  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  it  requires  strong  effort  and  support  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to make this happen.  The goal is further compounded\r\n\r\nby the fact that growth in the foreseeable two to three years is\r\n\r\nexpected  to be slow.  Successful nurturing, such as a  pool  of\r\n\r\nwell-managed  and  world-class companies  with  capabilities  to\r\n\r\ncompete  globally,  will  contribute  towards  more  sustainable\r\n\r\neconomic growth while decreasing our dependence on multinational\r\n\r\ncompanies in the longer term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears that there is no clear information or\r\n\r\nguideline  on  the criteria employed to designate  and  identify\r\n\r\nPLEs  and  I  therefore assume that this is  probably  based  on\r\n\r\nattainment  of  a certain level of revenue and profitability  by\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs.  While this is a good starting point, I think  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant also that the criteria be broadened to include smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies which demonstrate creative\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  innovative elements with a strong drive to succeed in their\r\n\r\nbusiness  and not just be solely driven by financial performance\r\n\r\nyardsticks.    Such  companies  are  likely   to   be   run   by\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs  with  products  featuring  new  technology   and\r\n\r\ninnovations.  Not all will make it big, but if we are in earnest\r\n\r\nabout   promoting  technopreneurship  and  creating  a   climate\r\n\r\nconducive to the sprouting of knowledge-based industries, as DPM\r\n\r\nTony  Tan  has  said, then the Government should  exercise  more\r\n\r\nflexibility in assisting and incentivising such risky ventures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the criteria I would like to suggest for\r\n\r\ntechnopreneur  PLEs  are  the consideration  for  (1)  companies\r\n\r\nstaffed  with  resilient people with creative ideas  in  product\r\n\r\ndesign  and a strong determination to succeed and make  it  big;\r\n\r\n(2)  companies with specialised and unique core competencies and\r\n\r\ncapabilities in process development, manufacturing technology or\r\n\r\nresearch  and  development; and (3) companies with  dynamic  and\r\n\r\nforward-looking  management  with  very  strong   time-to-market\r\n\r\norientation to react to and serve international market demands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I move on to the next cut, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> In spite of strenuous efforts by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to liberalise and make the Local Enterprise  Finance\r\n\r\nScheme  (LEFS)  more accessible, many local SMEs feel  that  the\r\n\r\neligibility  criteria  of the scheme are  still  too  stringent.\r\n\r\nThey felt that they are completely at the mercy of participating\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions (PFIs) when it comes  to  evaluation  of\r\n\r\ntheir  participation eligibility under the  LEFS  scheme.

The Appeal Board could  possibly  also\r\n\r\nplay  an  extended and advisory role by facilitating cooperation\r\n\r\nor  even  mergers between SMEs or similar industries for  shared\r\n\r\nresources,  for  synergy and for economies  of  scale,  wherever\r\n\r\nfeasible.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I have listened with great interest\r\n\r\nthe  opening remarks by Mr Lim Swee Say.  He defined what  is  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based company.  He outlined some of the criteria  and,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  six total capabilities of a knowledge-based  company.\r\n\r\nBut  at  the  end  of it, I am still not very  sure  what  is  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based company.  In fact, my colleague, Mr Ahmad Magad,\r\n\r\nhad  already very eloquently touched upon this topic  by  saying\r\n\r\nthat there is a lot of confusion surrounding what is a knowledge-based  enterprise.   In  fact, most  people  associate  it  with\r\n\r\nanything  to do with computers and, therefore, any products  and\r\n\r\nservices  associated with computers are considered a  knowledge-based enterprise.  But how about products and services based  on\r\n\r\nother  fields  of human endeavours?  As Mr Ahmad Magad  said,  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  economy  is  primarily  about  unleashing   and\r\n\r\npotentially utilising knowledge locked up in people's mind.   Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Swee Say also defined six criteria.  So I would like to ask\r\n\r\nhim whether a drug like Viagra will fulfil this definition of  a\r\n\r\nproduct of a knowledge-based company.  However we define it,  if\r\n\r\nSingapore could produce a product like that, it would provide  a\r\n\r\nvery  comfortable  lifestyle for all those associated  with  the\r\n\r\ndiscovery and marketing of this particular product.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is just one example to show that there are in fact\r\n\r\nimmense  potentials for breakthroughs in other fields  of  human\r\n\r\nendeavours  like life sciences and genetics.  There are  already\r\n\r\nglimpses  of  promise of drugs and remedies for killer  diseases\r\n\r\nlike  cancer,  as  well as medical problems  linked  to  genetic\r\n\r\ndefects.   So  when  we  talk about knowledge-based  enterprise,\r\n\r\nknowledge-based   company  and  knowledge-based   industry,   it\r\n\r\nactually  covers a very wide field.  My question to the Minister\r\n\r\nis  whether as a nation, we are spending our scarce resource  in\r\n\r\nfunding  R&D  in the right area and whether we are enabling  our\r\n\r\ncompanies to cross the technology gate, using Mr Lim Swee  Say's\r\n\r\nterm, to grow into future knowledge-based companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, one of our key long-term\r\n\r\nfocuses is developing a knowledge-based economy with an emphasis\r\n\r\non  technology-related sectors.  This requires us to compete  in\r\n\r\nthe  global  arena which are seen and will, in  the  foreseeable\r\n\r\nfuture,  see  the  most  intense and rapid  changes.   It  means\r\n\r\ncompeting against other economies in various parts of the world,\r\n\r\nall  intent  on establishing a foothold in the global technology\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heartbeat of technological innovation is of course research\r\n\r\nand  development (R&D).  And all around the world, R&D is moving\r\n\r\nat  a break-neck pace.  At this stage in the development of  our\r\n\r\nIT  industry,  I  feel  that more should  be  done  to  get  our\r\n\r\nresearchers  together to discuss the work  they  are  doing,  to\r\n\r\nshare  information  and  to create that buzz  which  our  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister mentioned.  Of course, confidential information  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  divulged.   But I feel that our technopreneurs  may  be  too\r\n\r\nconservative and afraid that someone would steal their ideas  if\r\n\r\nthese are disclosed.  From time to time, I have been referred to\r\n\r\nthe  web  pages of some US start-up companies and was amazed  by\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of information they contain on the technology  they\r\n\r\nare  developing.  These companies must find value in doing this,\r\n\r\neither   in  looking  for  synergetic  cooperation  with   other\r\n\r\ncompanies,  getting other researchers to join  them  to  further\r\n\r\ndevelop the technology, raising the profile of the company,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattracting  venture capital funds, or simply educating  the  R&D\r\n\r\ncommunity about the work they are doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us, I think such a buzz may be created and promoted in\r\n\r\nseveral  different  ways.  First, in having an  IT  or  Internet\r\n\r\nresource which local innovators, R&D personnel, IT entrepreneurs\r\n\r\ncan  tap  into  to  source for information particular  to  their\r\n\r\nindustry,   for  example,  a  directory  of  IT  resources   and\r\n\r\nbusinesses   and  on-line  yellow  pages  of   sorts,   with   a\r\n\r\nsufficiently  large database to provide a useful  and  efficient\r\n\r\nmeans to find out who are doing what.  It will also serve  as  a\r\n\r\none-stop  website  where  foreigners  can  visit  to  look   for\r\n\r\nSingapore  products and research capabilities.  We already  have\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore InfoNet, the national website, which tells  local\r\n\r\nand  foreigners alike about the broad range of things  happening\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  How about setting up one specifically  targetted\r\n\r\nfor  the  IT  industry?  Thereon, there will be no  reasons  for\r\n\r\nresearchers when they meet somebody else to say, \"I did not know\r\n\r\nthat  you  were developing this or we could have done  something\r\n\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on-line interaction provides a means of exchange\r\n\r\nwithin  the  IT  R&D  circle.   Even  if  the  researchers   are\r\n\r\nphysically cooped up in their cubicles 20 hours a day, they  can\r\n\r\nstill  reach  out  to the rest of the world  on-line.   However,\r\n\r\nthere seems to be very few R&D discussion groups formed by local\r\n\r\nresearchers  and  IT  business  people.   Although   there   are\r\n\r\ninternational   discussion  groups,  I  think   if   our   local\r\n\r\nresearchers  can  get  together for more  interaction  with  one\r\n\r\nanother  on particular issues and developments relating  to  the\r\n\r\nlocal  R&D  scene, many more opportunities can be created  among\r\n\r\nlocal  companies  to collaborate and combine  complementary  R&D\r\n\r\nactivities  and  different strengths to create better  products.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  the  National Computer Board can  host  a  website  to\r\n\r\nencourage this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the buzz can also be carried on off-line through\r\n\r\nnewsletters  and publications which provide regular  updates  on\r\n\r\nthe latest developments in the local IT industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, there is no substitute for physical interaction\r\n\r\nand  our  technopreneurs should not underestimate the importance\r\n\r\nof  networking through social interaction among themselves.   As\r\n\r\nmany  business  people  in  all industries  will  testify,  many\r\n\r\nvaluable  information is exchanged through  the  grapevine.   In\r\n\r\nSilicon  Valley, it was reported that the sharing of information\r\n\r\nis so spontaneous that two strangers, waiting in line to pay for\r\n\r\ntheir  food  in  a  cafeteria, can start chatting  and  form  an\r\n\r\nalliance  or  joint venture even before getting to the  cashier.\r\n\r\nIn  this area, organisations like the Singapore Science Park can\r\n\r\nplay  an  important role by providing facilities and  events  to\r\n\r\npromote  more social interaction for not only their tenants  but\r\n\r\nnon-tenants   as  well.   This  will  also  make   our   foreign\r\n\r\nresearchers feel more at home while working here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I look forward to the day when we have a lively and\r\n\r\nbuzzing R&D community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission, may I move on to the next issue about\r\n\r\nthe hosting of major exhibitions and conferences in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> I am very glad to see that much thinking and\r\n\r\neffort  have  been put in to develop the exhibition industry  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  is  one  of the areas in  which  we  have  good\r\n\r\npotential  to  grow  into a regional and global  hub.   The  tax\r\n\r\nincentives  to be given to exhibition organisers who host  their\r\n\r\nexhibitions in Singapore as well as the many initiatives by  the\r\n\r\nTrade  Development Board should give the exhibition  industry  a\r\n\r\nboost.   We  have the attraction of being relatively inexpensive\r\n\r\ncompared to other international exhibition centres in Asia  like\r\n\r\nTokyo  and  Hong  Kong, and we should continue to  maintain  our\r\n\r\ncomparative  cost advantage so that most organisers will  choose\r\n\r\nto come to Singapore to put up exhibitions on a bigger scale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we should bear in mind that being cost-competitive alone is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  enough  to elevate Singapore to a regional or  global  hub.\r\n\r\nTop  international convention centres built up their  reputation\r\n\r\nover  a  period of time by hosting high profile exhibitions  and\r\n\r\nevents.   During such events, plans for the whole year  are  set\r\n\r\nand  who's who in the industry congregate.  It is a must on  the\r\n\r\ncalendar  and  for leading firms and people in  that  particular\r\n\r\nindustry,  it  is  a  once-a-year  opportunity  to  widen  one's\r\n\r\nnetwork,  in  a  way  not possible at other  events  and  times.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in addition to getting the quantity in  numbers,  we\r\n\r\nmust also strive to secure one or two mega exhibitions or events\r\n\r\nto   be  held  here  annually.   Indeed,  even  aspire  to  host\r\n\r\nexhibitions to the scale and prestige of the annual events  like\r\n\r\nComdex Fall in Las Vegas and even the World Economic Forum  like\r\n\r\nthe one in Davos.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cater for this mega world-class events, we have to plan\r\n\r\nour  infrastructure carefully.  Our main exhibition  venues  are\r\n\r\nnow  at  the  Singapore Expo Centre in Changi, Suntec Convention\r\n\r\nCentre  and the World Trade Centre.  But for a truly mega event,\r\n\r\nany  one of these venues, by itself, might not be sufficient and\r\n\r\nif  the  event has to be divided into different venues, it  will\r\n\r\ncause much inconvenience and unhappiness for both exhibitors and\r\n\r\nvisitors.  For example, I visited last year's Comdex Fall at Las\r\n\r\nVegas.   The  Singapore Pavilion was situated in the  Sans  Expo\r\n\r\nCentre,  while  Microsoft, Creative and other major  attractions\r\n\r\nwere  at  the main Las Vegas Convention Centre.  People  had  to\r\n\r\ntravel  between the two venues by shuttle bus.  Compare this  to\r\n\r\nMilan  which is able to host its annual furniture and  lightings\r\n\r\nfair,  spread over 26 halls, all in one cluster.  Some of  these\r\n\r\nhalls are bigger than our Suntec Convention Centre.  I hope that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister would consider this in the further development  of\r\n\r\nour exhibition facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, this is a topic that I have not\r\n\r\nraised in this House before but after two years of feedback  and\r\n\r\npleas from the representatives of this sector through our GPC, I\r\n\r\nwould like to channel their feedback to the Minister and I  feel\r\n\r\nthat they do deserve some attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism is an important component of our economy and we\r\n\r\nshould  continue to promote it.  The retail sector cannot depend\r\n\r\non  local  consumption alone.  Tourism can play a  big  part  in\r\n\r\nhelping this sector.  In 1997, tourist shopping was around  $2.4\r\n\r\nbillion,  down  by 18% from 1996 level.  The key challenges  are\r\n\r\nthreefold:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) how do we bring in new tourists to Singapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) how to make arrived tourists stay a little longer or to\r\n\r\nkeep a business visitor here for one more day for leisure; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) how can we bring in repeat tourists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost alone is not a major factor as long as we can become a\r\n\r\nvalue-added destination for tourists.  So, we should not give up\r\n\r\nbringing  in  tourists  just  because  the  cost  of  living  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is high.  We should look at Hawaii, Paris  and  other\r\n\r\npopular  tourist destinations that still have a vibrant  tourism\r\n\r\nsector  despite  being  expensive cities.   The  issues  and  my\r\n\r\nsuggestions are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have stale and outdated theme parks like the Haw Par Villa,\r\n\r\nTang Dynasty Village, the Malay Village and the various gardens.\r\n\r\nThese, I think, are all too stale and will not be able to  bring\r\n\r\nin  repeat customers.  I guess the only theme park that is  able\r\n\r\nto  do  this  is the Singapore Zoo.  I would say that  going  to\r\n\r\nSentosa  once after a very long time is also sufficient.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see  any compelling reason to go back to Sentosa after  one\r\n\r\nvisit.   In fact, I visited Sentosa after about 7 years,  and  I\r\n\r\nfound  there  was nothing really attractive to  look  at  there.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  really  need  is  to  spend  money,  some  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure on developing world class theme parks like Universal\r\n\r\nStudios or Disneyland Park.  I guess Hong Kong has beaten us  to\r\n\r\nthe  Disney  project, but we should not give up.  Alternatively,\r\n\r\nwe  could  provide attractive incentives for such  companies  to\r\n\r\nlocate in Singapore, to also tap on the regional market as  well\r\n\r\nas  to  keep the business travellers in Singapore - and I  think\r\n\r\nthe number of business travellers is quite high - for at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nleast another day after their business has been done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest we focus on technology based theme parks that\r\n\r\noffer attractions like virtual reality where a visitor can spend\r\n\r\nthe whole day in such a theme park.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, both India and China are two very big markets for our\r\n\r\ntourist  industry.   They still want to shop  in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nvisit  our  places  of attraction.  In India alone  there  is  a\r\n\r\nmiddle  class population of about 200 million people capable  of\r\n\r\nspending money.  I am sure China has an equal, if not, a  bigger\r\n\r\nnumber  of  middle  class population.  Can I  request  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  work with the Ministry of Home Affairs to ease  travel\r\n\r\nrestrictions  for  people  of  these  countries  by  lifting  or\r\n\r\nsimplifying visa requirements for entry?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, double tax deductions for training expenses.\r\n\r\nBecause   retail  and  tourism  industries  are  mainly  service\r\n\r\norientated and depend on capability of human resources, can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment allow double tax deduction for training expenses  for\r\n\r\napproved training?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we should provide more funding to Singapore Tourism\r\n\r\nBoard so that they can more aggressively market Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\npopular tourist destination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, staging world class sporting activities. This is an\r\n\r\narea where we have not attempted to think big.  If we treat such\r\n\r\nactivities  as both sporting as well as a business  opportunity,\r\n\r\nwe  may be able to organise such activities on a different scale\r\n\r\nin order to attract tourists to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, until we can develop world class theme parks, can\r\n\r\ntax incentives be given for current operators like Tang Village,\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese and Japanese Gardens and others to upgrade  and  to\r\n\r\nimprove their facilities so that they become more attractive?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, can we allow the use of satellite technology\r\n\r\nas an alternative to cable television?  In this way, we will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nable  to provide competition for Singapore Cable Vision as  many\r\n\r\nMembers  in  this House have asked for and, at  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nreduce the cost to individuals, hotels and organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will seriously look into these\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am interested in bringing to the\r\n\r\nGovernment's attention the question of culture tourism.  We have\r\n\r\nthe  museums  here and I think more and more efforts  should  be\r\n\r\ndone  to attract tourists to visit these museums.  Secondly,  we\r\n\r\nare  a  multi-racial society.  We have a lot of advantages  over\r\n\r\nthe  other countries, whether it is a Chinese opera or an Indian\r\n\r\ndance.   We  should try to market these values to the  tourists.\r\n\r\nThere is a growing number of tourists who are interested in  not\r\n\r\njust  seeing  the  sights in Singapore  but  also  the  cultural\r\n\r\naspects  of  it, and we are unique in that we have the  Chinese,\r\n\r\nMalay  and  Indian  cultural heritage here.  I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  consider ways and means of  selling  this  to  the\r\n\r\ntourists.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, although I work for an\r\n\r\ninternational logistics company, I wish to give my  feedback  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  on some of the problems faced by local  logistics\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Recently, I see the Singapore Government's  growing\r\n\r\nemphasis to develop Singapore as a logistics hub.  And this  has\r\n\r\ngained recognition amongst MNCs of the need to use Singapore  as\r\n\r\nan   important hub for Asia Pacific countries.  It  is  of  such\r\n\r\nstrategic importance to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the MNCs, amidst the gloom of the Asian crisis, many of\r\n\r\nthem  are  in fact growing their business by large amounts,  and\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily for good reason.   The reason is that they  are\r\n\r\ntaking market share from local companies.  Local companies today\r\n\r\nfind  it hard to participate in international tenders.  They  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  the infrastructure, network, the world-wide  tracking\r\n\r\nsystems  in  order to do that.  The new types of  businesses  by\r\n\r\ncomputer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies  requiring  them to outsource  and  integrate  various\r\n\r\nparts  of their business, from vendors to suppliers to consumers\r\n\r\nwithin  Singapore's hub, make it extremely difficult  for  local\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  participate, unless they  synergise  and  set  up\r\n\r\nventures with other companies.  And this is where I find that we\r\n\r\nneed to do a lot more to help local companies develop.  Because,\r\n\r\notherwise, the hub will serve the major MNCs and not necessarily\r\n\r\nlocal  companies.  Major MNCs can come and go.  We hope to  have\r\n\r\nlocal  companies who can stay rooted in Singapore,  and  thereby\r\n\r\nactually helping Singapore in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect to this problem, Sir, and that is the\r\n\r\nproblem of technology.  There is this  view that because we  are\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, because we are close to our Asian neighbours,  we\r\n\r\nare  relevant to our Asian neighbours.  We can closely  navigate\r\n\r\nthe  intricate channels of moving across barriers to  all  these\r\n\r\ncountries,  very difficult barriers.  And the fact that  we  are\r\n\r\nAsians,  we  are  seen to be better able to  handle  this.   But\r\n\r\ntechnology  has made this very different, because we  no  longer\r\n\r\ncommunicate   through  the  phone  and   all   that.    Personal\r\n\r\nrelationship  has been replaced by more strategic  relationship.\r\n\r\nCommunication  is  through  network.   English  becomes  a  more\r\n\r\nuniversal language in this communication.  So what advantage  do\r\n\r\nwe  have  with a Thai, a Filipino, a Chinese or an Indian,  when\r\n\r\nnow the communication is through English.  American global MNCs,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  are better able to position themselves  and  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  the situation.  This is where our  advantage  and\r\n\r\nconnection with the Asian countries may now become more  than  a\r\n\r\nmyth and a reality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do nothing about it, I am afraid our position as an\r\n\r\ninternational  hub  may  be  terribly  affected.   And  this  is\r\n\r\nespecially so because a lot of the factors in developing our hub\r\n\r\ncan  be easily copied by other countries.  As you know, they are\r\n\r\ndeveloping their own ports, airports and infrastructure.  And if\r\n\r\nyou  look  around,  some of the incentive programmes  have  been\r\n\r\noffered  by neighbouring countries.  Many Members in this  House\r\n\r\nwill know that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome  of the terms, rules and regulations and incentives offered\r\n\r\nare  very familiar.  It is easy to copy incentives.  We can give\r\n\r\nwhatever  we can give.  And the only hope is that we have  local\r\n\r\ncompanies who can stay in Singapore and develop Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nhub.   This  is  where I hope the Minister will  look  at  other\r\n\r\nincentives,  beyond  what  have been announced  in  the  Budget,\r\n\r\nspecifically to help local companies to take advantage of  these\r\n\r\nincentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, recently, in its presentation of Industry 21, EDB reiterated the goal that manufacturing and manufacturing-related services should contribute 25% to GDP. This objective\r\n\r\nhas  been  in  place for some years already.  I agree  with  the\r\n\r\nrationale  that  in a sovereign state, it is desirable  to  have\r\n\r\nboth manufacturing and services, and that both should constitute\r\n\r\nthe  engines  of growth.  For the last three years,  the  actual\r\n\r\nshare  of manufacturing has in fact been slightly lower at about\r\n\r\n23%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I would like to make is that the achievement of such a\r\n\r\ngoal needs proactive policy support and policy alignment of  all\r\n\r\nagencies concerned.  First, there needs to be an inflow of  high\r\n\r\nvalue  added  manufacturing to replace  the  lower  value  added\r\n\r\nmanufacturing,  which  is being relocated  to  other  more  cost\r\n\r\neffective  destinations.  Hence Industry 21  and  its  focus  on\r\n\r\nknowledge-driven industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, industrial land has to be priced appropriately. Even\r\n\r\nwith  the  recent reductions in JTC and HDB rentals,  industrial\r\n\r\nland  is  costly  in Singapore.  Hence, I agree with  the  CSC's\r\n\r\nrecommendation that the pricing of industrial land needs to take\r\n\r\ninto  account  cost  competitiveness.  Land Office,  I  believe,\r\n\r\ntherefore needs to re-examine its pricing of industrial land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, more can be done to maximise the usage of industrial\r\n\r\nland.   JTC's Industrial Land Plan 21 is a good start, but  more\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be  done.   Again, the CSC Report has  some  concrete\r\n\r\nrecommendations.   One such measure is to increase  the  maximum\r\n\r\nallowable  plot ratio in industrial estates beyond  the  present\r\n\r\n2.5.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, JTC can, in formulating usage requirements, take into\r\n\r\naccount  the increasing integration of manufacturing  production\r\n\r\nand   manufacturing  related  services,  such  as   design   and\r\n\r\nlogistics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the goal that manufacturing should contribute 25%\r\n\r\nto  GDP needs active policy support from all relevant Government\r\n\r\nagencies and an inter-agency approach, including EDB, JTC,  Land\r\n\r\nOffice and URA.  I would appreciate the Minister's clarification\r\n\r\nregarding whether this is indeed the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would like to raise my\r\n\r\nconcerns  over  the  safety of consumer products  in  our  local\r\n\r\nmarket.   Most  of us assume the constant presence  of  watchdog\r\n\r\nbodies  that ensure products sold in Singapore would be free  of\r\n\r\ntoxic  or  harmful  effects.  I would like to suggest  that  our\r\n\r\nassumptions should be upheld and a regulatory body, either under\r\n\r\nan  inter-Ministry  body  or MTI control,  should  be  there  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  all  products and ascertain that they  do  not  contain\r\n\r\nhazardous substances.  This must be put in place to protect  the\r\n\r\nconsumers' interest.  Sir, this is especially important when, in\r\n\r\nfact,  the  consumers are our children.  Indeed,  products  that\r\n\r\ncontain harmful substances, harmful to children, have been found\r\n\r\nin the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hong Kong last year, according to the environmental group\r\n\r\n\"Greenpeace\",  cancer-causing toxins have  been  found  in  soft\r\n\r\npolyvinyl  chloride (PVC) children's toys.   The  warning  about\r\n\r\nthis  came  after the group commissioned independent  tests  and\r\n\r\nfound  phthalates in 28 toys bought from seven  stores  in  Hong\r\n\r\nKong.  Toys were not allowed to have more than 3% of phthalates.\r\n\r\nThese  toys  included a teether, a plastic key, some dolls,  and\r\n\r\nsome  bath  toys.   Young children chewing  or  sucking  on  the\r\n\r\nproducts  could  ingest the chemicals that  were  used  to  make\r\n\r\nplastic  soft and flexible.  Links have been established between\r\n\r\nphthalates  and liver as well as kidney cancer.   The  chemicals\r\n\r\ncan also damage reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must beseech the Ministry of Trade and Industry to take\r\n\r\nnecessary preventive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeasures  to ensure that any consumer product, whether  imported\r\n\r\nor  locally  produced, does not pose hazards to  public  health.\r\n\r\nSir,  whilst  we  do  not  want  to  over  regulate  and  affect\r\n\r\nSingapore's pro-business environment, the Ministry of Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry must not neglect this responsibility for anything.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, first, I would like to follow up on Dr\r\n\r\nLily  Neo's point about toy safety standards.  In the early 70s,\r\n\r\nthe  Consumers Association of Singapore actually created a  toys\r\n\r\nsafety  standards  authority, which looked into  issues  of  toy\r\n\r\nsafety and toxins in toys and so on.  We had to close that  work\r\n\r\r\nbecause  there  were no funds forthcoming.   And  it  is  indeed\r\n\r\nsomething that we hope can change if the Ministry, for  example,\r\n\r\ncould grant us more money on this project.  We do have a toy and\r\n\r\nproduct testing service currently and, again, that is very  much\r\n\r\nhampered  by the lack of funds.  Nonetheless, we would  move  on\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would want to mention another issue which relates to\r\n\r\nconsumer  protection.  In a Question I filed in  the  House  for\r\n\r\nOral Answer in November 1997, I asked the Minister whether there\r\n\r\nare  plans to curb the price fixing practices of monopolies  and\r\n\r\ncartels.   As there was no time for an oral reply, the Minister,\r\n\r\nin his written reply, said that the Singapore economy is an open\r\n\r\none  and price fixing behaviour by cartels is best prevented  by\r\n\r\nopen  competition  in the market place.  Where  essentials  like\r\n\r\nrice  and  pork are concerned, the Minister said that the  Price\r\n\r\nControl Act empowers his Ministry to set prices, but added  that\r\n\r\nkeen   competition  has  made  this  unnecessary   because   the\r\n\r\nGovernment can stay out of the market if the prices are  set  by\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take this opportunity to raise this issue again as the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  anti-competitive practices has  not  been  resolved\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily.   Anti-competitive practices were  in  fact  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  a recent furore over telecommunication charges.   I\r\n\r\nthink  last year, in a well-publicised court, there was  another\r\n\r\nform\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  anti-competitive  practice called  the  \"recommended  retail\r\n\r\nprice\"  (RRP)  practice.   What  happened  was  that  a  certain\r\n\r\nmanufacturer  sets the price of the product  they  made  and  by\r\n\r\nbinding  retailers to this RRP.  Essentially, in this  practice,\r\n\r\nretailers who dare to sell below the recommended price, even  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  able  to  because they have lower  costs  than  other\r\n\r\nretailers,  such retailers would be penalised.  The penalty  may\r\n\r\nbe  damages for a breach of contract or the supplier flexes  his\r\n\r\neconomic muscle by killing off the retailer's business, such  as\r\n\r\nby stopping all supplies to this brave retailer.  Since economic\r\n\r\ndeath  is worse than damages, most of these rebellious retailers\r\n\r\nare not taken to court.  They simply capitulate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the famous case, the retailer was too big to kill, so the\r\n\r\nmatter  ended up in court.  Unfortunately, for the  supplier  in\r\n\r\nquestion, the court found no binding contract in existence,  and\r\n\r\nso  the  supplier lost.  In the midst of all the media hype,  it\r\n\r\nescaped public notice that the supplier would actually have  won\r\n\r\nif  the retailer had signed a contract.  This practice of fixing\r\n\r\nprices, called Resale Price Maintenance (RPM), is illegal in the\r\n\r\nUK  and several other common law jurisdictions, but is well  and\r\n\r\nalive and totally legal in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after this famous case, the local supermarket scene\r\n\r\ndescended  into  a  \"price  war\",  with  different  supermarkets\r\n\r\ncompeting  to  sell the same goods at as low  a  price  as  they\r\n\r\ncould.  Ultimately, it was the consumer who benefited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common knowledge that there are several cartels in\r\n\r\nSingapore  which practise RPM.  Some of them in fact argue  that\r\n\r\nbecause  of free competition, the prices are exactly  the  same.\r\n\r\nThese are the petrol companies.  How peculiar!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not against manufacturers and wholesalers recommending\r\n\r\na  retail  price.  In many cases, this RRP makes it  easier  for\r\n\r\ncustomers  to  know when his local retailer is profiteering  and\r\n\r\nselling way above the market price.  But RRP enforced by pain of\r\n\r\nsevere penalties does not benefit the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsumer.   There are many business cartels in  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nPrice Control Act, even if the Minister is willing to apply  it,\r\n\r\ndoes not apply to these trades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would plead with the Minister to make RPM an illegal\r\n\r\npractice, because consumers are suffering under prices fixed  in\r\n\r\nthis rigid way and it should not be allowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move on to my next cut? Twice in the last two years,\r\n\r\nin  response to queries which I raised, the Ministry of  Finance\r\n\r\nhas  assured  the  House  that they are  looking  into  laws  to\r\n\r\nregulate  the  unscrupulous practices of soft commodity  trading\r\n\r\nfirms  and  timeshare companies.  This is why I  actually  filed\r\n\r\nthis  cut under the Ministry of Finance earlier, but it  appears\r\n\r\nthat  you,  Sir, prefer that I say my piece to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry.  Perhaps it was due to the impression that I\r\n\r\nwill be talking about shops selling buckets.  The regulation  of\r\n\r\nbucket  shops or soft commodity trading firms is something  that\r\n\r\nis necessary.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These firms are called \"bucket shops\" primarily because of the\r\n\r\nsuspicion  that  they take money from the public without  making\r\n\r\ntrades, and actually keeping the money in their tills and  churn\r\n\r\nit  round, paying different parties that they pick at random out\r\n\r\nof their till or \"bucket\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these bucket shops attract new investments by\r\n\r\nadvertising  for  housewives,  elderly  retirees,  students  and\r\n\r\nforeign  workers to apply for high paying part time  jobs  which\r\n\r\nrequire  no  experience  and  training.  All  these  groups  are\r\n\r\nvulnerable  in  different  ways.  They are  inexperienced,  less\r\n\r\neducated and perhaps more gullible. They are relatively hard  up\r\n\r\nfinancially  and easily enticed by high salaries  and  they  are\r\n\r\nunable  to afford lawyers to advise them or to sue if things  go\r\n\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides false job advertisements, such bucket shops also\r\n\r\nresort to lies, misleading information, hard sell and intense\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npsychological pressure to get the job-seekers - who have entered\r\n\r\nthe  hyena  dens  - to throw in their life savings  in  tens  of\r\n\r\nthousands  of  dollars.   They say  this  is  to  gain  \"trading\r\n\r\nexperience\"  for the new jobs.  One of the key  lines  given  by\r\n\r\nthese  shops  to  wary  investors, in fact,  is  something  that\r\n\r\ncapitalises on the known fact that the MAS is a strict regulator\r\n\r\nof  the financial and investment industry. They claim that  they\r\n\r\nare not rogues, because if they were, the MAS would have stopped\r\n\r\ntheir activities.  A very simple argument.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Consumers' Association, CASE, and the Commercial\r\n\r\nAffairs  Department are at their wits' end to stop  such  unfair\r\n\r\ntraders.  CASE has also been pushing for a Fair Trading Act,  or\r\n\r\nat  least  some kind of law governing representations and  sales\r\n\r\npromotion  tactics,  to  stop these  scoundrels  from  operating\r\n\r\nuntouched by any law.  Such traders give us a bad name and  make\r\n\r\na  mockery  of our systems of law and justice.  An  Act  can  be\r\n\r\ndrafted  generally enough not to cover specific  commodities  or\r\n\r\ninvestment  schemes.   It can also give  due  force  of  law  to\r\n\r\nindustry  self-regulating  Codes  like  the  Singapore  Code  of\r\n\r\nAdvertising Practice.  In this way, they will be wide enough  to\r\n\r\ncover the types of scams like those mentioned by Mr Sin Boon Ann\r\n\r\nyesterday  in this House (the ostrich and ostrich egg  schemes),\r\n\r\ntimeshare schemes and soft commodity futures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has said it will introduce laws soon. Sir,\r\n\r\nwill it be in this millennium?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, I share the sentiments\r\n\r\nof  Dr  Toh See Kiat when he talked about the control of  bucket\r\n\r\nshops.   Like him, I filed this amendment under the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance.  I begin to understand that now commodities trading  is\r\n\r\nactually governed by the Trade Development Board, which  is  why\r\n\r\nmy amendment is now being referred to this Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, commodities trading, whether it is of precious metals\r\n\r\nlike  gold or silver or soft commodities like pork belly or soya\r\n\r\nbeans,  are all part and parcel of the futures trading activity.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrading  of  rubber  and coffee is regulated  by  the  Commodity\r\n\r\nFutures Act, but not other commodities like pork belly and  soya\r\n\r\nbeans. As a result, gazetting is not required and no licence  is\r\n\r\nrequired to run a soft commodities trading firm.  To me, this is\r\n\r\nextremely strange.  As a financial centre, we would expect  that\r\n\r\nthese activities should be regulated under the Commodity Futures\r\n\r\nAct  in  total or part of the Commodity Futures Act.  It is  not\r\n\r\ncomprehensible  why these firms are allowed to  operate  outside\r\n\r\nthe ambit of all the laws that we have in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the key features of bucket shops, besides what\r\n\r\nDr  Toh  has mentioned, is that sometimes they do false  trades.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, whatever trade is done on behalf of a  client,\r\n\r\nthe  commodities firm actually first buys and sells it  back  to\r\n\r\nthe  client to make the money.  This is how they generate a  lot\r\n\r\nof  trade  and that is why the client always ends up to  be  the\r\n\r\nlosing party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a financial centre, it is indeed strange that we today\r\n\r\nread  of  bucket  operations still taking  place  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nPeople are still trading in soya beans and pork bellies and such\r\n\r\nthings.   These are losses incurred by innocent bystanders.   In\r\n\r\nmost  cases, we may call them gullible or naive.  But  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  we  allow these firms to operate in our strict environment\r\n\r\ngives  these  firms  a sense of respectability.   As  a  result,\r\n\r\ngullible innocent Singaporeans get trapped into it and they  are\r\n\r\nstill  thriving.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to explain  why\r\n\r\nit is not in our own interest to bring all these firms under the\r\n\r\nCommodity  Futures Act.  Alternatively, if we cannot bring  them\r\n\r\nunder  the Commodity Futures Act, maybe we should prohibit  such\r\n\r\nactivities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  the  National  Computer Board or the  Productivity  and\r\n\r\nStandards Board could spearhead the establishment of some  basic\r\n\r\nstandards  in  e-commerce practices.  There  are  some  critical\r\n\r\naspects  of an e-commerce transaction which are often  difficult\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimpossible for the web buyer to know, just by assessing what the\r\n\r\nvendor  has presented on the web.

If,\r\n\r\nhowever,  there is some form of certification analogous  to  the\r\n\r\nISO  certifications on standards and quality issued by a neutral\r\n\r\nbody,  this  would help web surfing consumers to  find  reliable\r\n\r\nvendors   on-line  and  to  help  reliable  businesses  identify\r\n\r\nthemselves as such.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even hawker and food stalls have a grading system\r\n\r\nestablished  by the Ministry of the Environment to assess  their\r\n\r\nhygiene standards.  The grading system does not purport to judge\r\n\r\nthe  quality of the food sold, but rather the hygiene  standards\r\n\r\nof  individual stalls.  It is easily recognisable  and  provides\r\n\r\nreal  impetus  for hawkers to improve the hygiene  standards  of\r\n\r\ntheir stalls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that businesses on the web, which\r\n\r\nmeet  the basic minimum requirements, be awarded a certification\r\n\r\nseal  which they can display on their web page.  The  seal  will\r\n\r\ngive  an  indication to the web shoppers of the type and quality\r\n\r\nof  service  to  expect.  This certification  body  can  conduct\r\n\r\nperiodical review of the technical practices of these businesses\r\n\r\nand  can use exposure through on-line and off-line publications,\r\n\r\nseal   withdrawal  or  Government  referrals  to   impose   real\r\n\r\nconsequences on non-compliance with the standards established.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the Y2K problem has\r\n\r\ncaused more than 2,500 websites to spring up, giving tips on how\r\n\r\nto  cope  with  the millennium bug.

In short, Sir,  how\r\n\r\nready are we for the Y2K problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Sir, it is an accepted fact that\r\n\r\ntechnology is now ruling our lives than ever before.  In today's\r\n\r\nhomes,  office buildings, public places, we have installed  more\r\n\r\nand  more  gadgets that use energy.  Some of these  gadgets  are\r\n\r\ninstalled  some  years  ago  and  they  are  no  longer   energy\r\n\r\nefficient.  For example, the typical magnetic ballast  used  for\r\n\r\nfluorescent  lights  consumes 30% more energy  than  the  latest\r\n\r\nelectronic  ballast.  The air-conditioning system in  a  10-year\r\n\r\nold  building  can be retrofitted with new ones  that  save  50%\r\n\r\nenergy.   Because  of  this development in  technology,  the  US\r\n\r\nFederal  Government  in  1992 passed a law  to  require  Federal\r\n\r\nfacilities to achieve a minimum of 30% energy saving.  They have\r\n\r\nachieved  that  and  many  places  have  actually  reported  60%\r\n\r\nsavings.  The Berlin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngovernment  subsequently also required 5,000 of their government\r\n\r\nbuildings to be retrofitted with energy saving devices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we do not see any concerted effort on the part of\r\n\r\nthe  Government to promote energy conservation.  In the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  some  developers took their own initiative  to  install\r\n\r\nthese  devices  and, therefore, they reaped  benefits  from  it.\r\n\r\nThey did not even have to come up with the capital.  Very often,\r\n\r\nthe  ones  that provide the technology would pay for  it  first.\r\n\r\nThey usually get their return on investment from a share in  the\r\n\r\nenergy  saved.  One wonders who has the technology and  who  can\r\n\r\nprovide such retrofitting services without asking for payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have learnt is this. The companies that can provide the\r\n\r\ntechnology and services are just in our backyards.  Some of them\r\n\r\nare  already  being  engaged  by very  big  utilities  companies\r\n\r\noverseas  but  somehow they are not recognised here.  Hence,  if\r\n\r\nsuch  a  situation  exists, should our Government  or  the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  or  the  rest  of the people  not  take  this  up?   I\r\n\r\ntherefore urge the Minister to study this and, if possible, have\r\n\r\nan  energy  saving campaign for the whole nation.  In the  short\r\n\r\nrun,  it can save us some money to reduce the deficit.

The\r\n\r\ndifference  is that efficiency is doing more with less,  whereas\r\n\r\nconservation suggests that we do nothing or do without. There is\r\n\r\na  great difference between the two terms: energy efficiency  is\r\n\r\nan achievement in competitiveness.  It is this change of mindset\r\n\r\nthat  I  wish  to encourage the Minister to consider  fostering.\r\n\r\nNot  with specific technology.  It is not a question of hardware\r\n\r\nor  gadgets at this stage, it is a question of mindset change in\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  first and foremost, and then  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.   In the Government, when it comes to its own  projects,\r\n\r\nits  own  buildings,  and  then  in  the  Government's  role  as\r\n\r\nregulator and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstandard  setter for the private sector.  There are  reasons  of\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness, as I have said, to do this.  There  is  also  a\r\n\r\ncoming  reason  in terms of international law  and  the  climate\r\n\r\nchange  convention, which will eventually set the limits to  how\r\n\r\nmuch  each  country  can emit in terms of carbon  emissions  and\r\n\r\nother things that relate to energy production.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the primary concerns, besides the change of mindset,\r\n\r\nis  the coming privatisation of Singapore Power.  In privatising\r\n\r\nSingapore's power companies in future, I would ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nto  adopt policies that would encourage these power companies to\r\n\r\npromote  efficiency  rather than the sale of  more  power,  more\r\n\r\nenergy, at more costs and more profits.  In this sense,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nam asking the Minister to consider incentives for efficiency.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  there  is  a coming inter-agency  report  on  energy\r\n\r\nefficiency  and  I  think  in this light  it  would  be  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant document to set about the change of mindset.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the desalination\r\n\r\ntechnology development is, as what the Prime Minister  mentioned\r\n\r\nin  his speech to the grassroots leaders during the Chinese  New\r\n\r\nYear  reception,  that it is a progress towards  our  advantage.\r\n\r\nTrue  enough,  the  cost of desalination  of  water  has  fallen\r\n\r\ntremendously  in the recent year.  According to a recent  tender\r\n\r\ncalled for building an operation by the State of Florida in  the\r\n\r\nUS,  the  water  from the sea water reverse osmosis  system  was\r\n\r\noffered  at a price as low as US67 cents per cubic metre,  which\r\n\r\nis about S$1.17 cents per cubic metre for the next 30 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could see that from this tender in the US, the cost of\r\n\r\nwater  production  by the sea water reverse osmosis  is  reduced\r\n\r\nsignificantly.   It is reduced from what people  believe  to  be\r\n\r\nabout US$1.15 cents per cubic metre to as low as US67 cents  per\r\n\r\ncubic  metre.  From a study reported by Desalination, the  water\r\n\r\nreuse magazine,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  March  1998, the estimated cost of water from a  multi-stage\r\n\r\nfresh  desalination system, like the one that we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nbuild,  will be about 39% higher than the unit water  cost  from\r\n\r\nthe reverse osmosis system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one may like to ask why the reverse osmosis water is\r\n\r\nso  cheap and yet, we are not so keen in that particular system.\r\n\r\nI think the main concern may be the quality of water because the\r\n\r\nsalinity  of  the  water product would be about  200  parts  per\r\n\r\nmillion.   Since we are self-sufficient for almost half  of  the\r\n\r\nwater  that we need, the blending of the water from the  reverse\r\n\r\nosmosis with the fresh water supply would reduce the salinity of\r\n\r\nthe  water  to  an extent which is not so objectionable  to  our\r\n\r\npeople.   Based on the construction cost of less than  US$5  per\r\n\r\ngallon  per day, the 30 million gallons per day system we  would\r\n\r\nlike to build would cost around S$260 million.  There will be  a\r\n\r\nsignificant cost saving also if we consider this kind of system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, based on the significant price reduction in both the\r\n\r\nwater  cost  per cubic metre and the construction  cost  of  the\r\n\r\ninternationally called project, we should not rule out  the  sea\r\n\r\nwater  reverse  osmosis  as  a  cost-effective  alternative   to\r\n\r\ndesalination  for  Singapore.  We should  consider  the  reverse\r\n\r\nosmosis system seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, Singapore ranks sixth in the world\r\n\r\nas  the most water-short country.  The rate of increase in water\r\n\r\nconsumption  has  been  about 5% a year  for  the  past  decade.\r\n\r\nToday,  we  need 1.2 million cubic metre of water  daily,  about\r\n\r\nhalf  of  which comes from water catchment areas, and  the  rest\r\n\r\ncomes  from  Johor.  We all know that the water agreements  with\r\n\r\nJohor will expire in the years 2011 and 2061 respectively.   And\r\n\r\nthe  Government has planned to build three desalination  plants,\r\n\r\nthe  first  costing $1 billion will be built at  Tuas  and  will\r\n\r\nproduce 137,000 cubic metres a day when ready.  Assoc. Prof. Low\r\n\r\nhas already touched upon the various methods of desalination.  I\r\n\r\nwould  not  go into that.  When all three plants are  completed,\r\n\r\nthe combined supply will be about 400,000 cubic metres a day.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all agree that Singapore should treasure its supply of\r\n\r\nfresh  water.   The  image  of DPM Lee  at  a  press  conference\r\n\r\npointing to a bottle of mineral water, stressing that we  should\r\n\r\ntreat our tap water as precious as that bottle of mineral water,\r\n\r\nhas left a very deep impression on my mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, by the same measure, I would also find it very\r\n\r\nunconscionable to use the same bottle of mineral water to  flush\r\n\r\nour   toilets.   In  fact,  it  would  be  very  environmentally\r\n\r\nunfriendly when we consider that large scale desalination  would\r\n\r\nconsume  a  huge amount of energy which would in turn contribute\r\n\r\nto global warming.  If we just focus on desalination as a source\r\n\r\nof  fresh water, I think we have not done enough to explore  the\r\n\r\nuse of recycled water and sea water for flushing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of a pilot project several years ago to use\r\n\r\nrecycled  water  in  Teban Garden for  flushing.   However,  the\r\n\r\nresidents had tremendous problems with it.  My concern  is  that\r\n\r\nthat attempt was a bit half-hearted.  In my view, JTC did not do\r\n\r\na very good job to ensure success in that pilot project, because\r\n\r\nrecycled water is corrosive and metal components that could  not\r\n\r\nstand  the  corrosion were used in that particular  system.   As\r\n\r\nsuch,  I think it was very regrettable because it turned us  off\r\n\r\nfrom the use of alternative water supply for flushing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came across sea water flushing in Hong Kong more than 18\r\n\r\nyears  ago.   I brought up the subject of sea water flushing  in\r\n\r\nthis  House in my first term as Member of Parliament,  about  14\r\n\r\nyears   ago.    Recently,   I  led   a   delegation   of   seven\r\n\r\nParliamentarians to Hong Kong and I learned about the use of sea\r\n\r\nwater for flushing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Singapore, the demand for water in Hong Kong for the\r\n\r\npast  20 years up to 1990 grew by 6% a year.  Their water supply\r\n\r\nproblems  are  also  largely due to no  appreciable  underground\r\n\r\nwater;  no sizable lakes or rivers; and lack of catchment areas,\r\n\r\nwhich are very similar to ours.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Hong Kong has an advantage. It is part of China and\r\n\r\nthe province of Guangdong is happy to supply it with water.   By\r\n\r\n1996, Guangdong provided about 720 million cubic metres of water\r\n\r\nto Hong Kong, about 70% of their total demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even with such an assured water supply, Hong Kong has\r\n\r\nbuilt  a  separate  system  to supply  sea  water  for  flushing\r\n\r\npurposes in urban areas and new towns.  This system was  started\r\n\r\nin  the late 1950s, close to 40 years ago.  Though sea water  is\r\n\r\nnot  treated to the same standard as fresh water, it is supplied\r\n\r\nthrough  a  completely separate system through  pumping  system,\r\n\r\nservice  reservoirs and water mains, from those used  for  fresh\r\n\r\nwater.   One of the main concerns I have heard repeatedly  about\r\n\r\ndual water system supply is the possibility of accidentally mis-connecting  sea water supply or recycled water to  fresh  water.\r\n\r\nMembers  may be interested to learn that since its induction  in\r\n\r\nHong  Kong,  there was not a single incidence of mis-connection.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  today,  over  70% of Hong  Kong  population  are  now\r\n\r\nsupplied  with  sea  water for flushing.  In 1995,  the  average\r\n\r\ndaily  amount  of  sea water supplied was 434,000  cubic  metres\r\n\r\nwhich  is more than the combined total of all the three  of  our\r\n\r\nproposed  desalination plants.  As our average of  water  demand\r\n\r\nfor fresh water was 2.5 million cubic metres in 1995, this means\r\n\r\nthat  we would have used, say, sea water like what we have  used\r\n\r\nin  Hong Kong, it would mean a saving of close to 14.6%.  So you\r\n\r\ncan look at it as a very substantial alternative supply of fresh\r\n\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this is one area that we could learn something\r\n\r\nfrom  Hong Kong and I suggest that the Government seriously look\r\n\r\ninto this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh earlier said that\r\n\r\nin  seven years there have been no changes to Sentosa.  I beg to\r\n\r\ndisagree.  There have been changes.  Unfortunately, some of  the\r\n\r\nchanges have been for the worse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think tourism is a major foreign exchange earner in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntourism has declined largely because of the economic crisis that\r\n\r\nhas  impacted Asia.  It is all the more important for us now  to\r\n\r\nconcentrate on efforts to make sure that our tourist attractions\r\n\r\nare  indeed  drawing money for us.  Sentosa is the  gem  in  the\r\n\r\ncrown jewels of Singapore, and we must pay some attention to it.\r\n\r\nIn  developing the attractions in Singapore, especially Sentosa,\r\n\r\nI  think there are certain principles that I would like to  urge\r\n\r\nthe Government to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is a need to keep astride of international\r\n\r\ndevelopments  and  trends in this area, and  especially  of  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of tourists and locals, what they want to see in  tourist\r\n\r\nattractions.  Mr Inderjit Singh has mentioned, for example, that\r\n\r\nwe  have  already  lost out to Hong Kong in  getting  Disneyland\r\n\r\nwhich is a real big money spinner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle is that we must continually update what has\r\n\r\nbecome  obsolete,  even  if  they  had  been  grand  and   great\r\n\r\nattractions  in  the past.  For example, in a  recent  visit  to\r\n\r\nSentosa  -  I  do  visit Sentosa too - the  Asian  Village,  for\r\n\r\nexample, is dead.  Practically everything is closed.  And a  few\r\n\r\npitiful  rides  that are still functioning  have  got  very  few\r\n\r\ncustomers.   I think some of these things need to be  torn  down\r\n\r\nand rebuilt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No money.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> If there is no money, I think this is why\r\n\r\nthe Ministry must put some grants into it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third principle, Sir, is that we must not turn people\r\n\r\noff.   Visitors who come, especially the locals, they  come  for\r\n\r\nsomething that they want to see and enjoy and they go away  with\r\n\r\nthis idea that something is wrong, because it is sloppy, because\r\n\r\nit  is tacky, because it is not quite tasteful.  For example,  I\r\n\r\ntook my visitors to Sentosa.  Usually when I go to Sentosa it is\r\n\r\nbecause  I bring visitors from overseas.  I went to this Merlion\r\n\r\nthat they spent lots of money on.  Ran up right to the top,  one\r\n\r\ntiny hole, and a long queue of people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwaiting  to see through that tiny hole.  And then right  at  the\r\n\r\nbottom  of  it, there is this video show on the \"Legend  of  the\r\n\r\nMerlion\".  Sir, I was amazed at the total unconvincing nature of\r\n\r\nthis legend which is, of course, totally fictional, because  the\r\n\r\nMerlion  was invented by the Tourist Promotion Board some  years\r\n\r\nago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of sloppiness was in the sign. I saw this\r\n\r\nsign  that  says  \"To  the  Causeway\".   Of  course,  they  were\r\n\r\nreferring  to the fake tower bridge that links the  mainland  to\r\n\r\nSentosa.  It looks like a tower bridge; it is beautiful.  But it\r\n\r\nis  not a causeway because from what I know, a causeway is built\r\n\r\nfrom the bottom of the sea up, and that is a bridge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should stay away from this \"instant noodle\" sort\r\n\r\nof  syndrome  -  something  picked up,  put  water,  and  viola,\r\n\r\ntourists would come.  For example, the VolcanoLand is an instant\r\n\r\nnoodle  volcano.   We do not have volcanoes in  Singapore.   How\r\n\r\nsad!  So let us build a VolcanoLand.  There is, of course, as  I\r\n\r\nmentioned, the Merlion legend.  If we do not have a real legend,\r\n\r\nSir,   I  think  we  should  stay  away  from  creating  totally\r\n\r\nunimaginative ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was visiting China some years back and there was this\r\n\r\nofficial  who actually talked to me about Sentosa's  attractions\r\n\r\nand  our  tourist attractions and he said to me, \"In  Singapore,\r\n\r\nyou  have nothing to show tourists.  And yet you have 7  million\r\n\r\nof them every year.  In China, we have got so much to show them.\r\n\r\nI  think we can beat you one day.\"  But that was, in a sense,  a\r\n\r\nbackhand  compliment, Sir.  We have done very  well  to  attract\r\n\r\ntourists  but we must not rest on our laurels.  Tourism  is  our\r\n\r\nlife-line;  we  must develop Sentosa and our  other  attractions\r\n\r\ntastefully and sensitively.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b>\r\n\r\nSir,  I  wish  to  thank all Members who have spoken  for  their\r\n\r\nviews,  suggestions  and  queries as  well  as  their  beguiling\r\n\r\nstories  of  Sentosa.  Now that all Members have had their  full\r\n\r\nsay,  it remains for me and my colleagues to try and answer  all\r\n\r\nthe  queries  within the next half an hour or so,  plus  another\r\n\r\nhalf an hour tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a small point about the causeway to Sentosa. I was\r\n\r\ntold that it is partly a causeway and a bridge.  Part of it is a\r\n\r\ncauseway and part of it is a bridge.  So you might want to  call\r\n\r\nit  Causeway Bridge, if you like.  But the more important  point\r\n\r\nis we must take a re-look at Sentosa, and that is our intention,\r\n\r\nto  try and bring in some consultants and take a re-look.   This\r\n\r\nis  in  accordance with the recommendations of the Committee  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's Competitiveness.  My colleague, Mr Tang  Guan  Seng,\r\n\r\nwill respond more fully on tourism matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to touch on this issue of our economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  Dr Lee Tsao Yuan and Mr Tay  Beng  Chuan  have\r\n\r\nexpressed the need to monitor our business costs closely and  to\r\n\r\nput  in  place the necessary machinery to monitor the impact  of\r\n\r\nthe  cost-cutting  measures  and  the  state  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry and the other economic agencies have\r\n\r\nestablished  a  comprehensive mechanism to do so.   We  rely  on\r\n\r\nregular  meetings  with businessmen, surveys of  companies,  and\r\n\r\nvarious   economic  statistics  such  as  trade  and  industrial\r\n\r\nproduction figures.  This combination of on-the-ground  feedback\r\n\r\nand  timely hard data enables the Government to keep close  tabs\r\n\r\non  the  economic situation and the problems faced by businesses\r\n\r\nand  Singaporeans.  We will continue to explore ways to  improve\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee suggested using the Internet as one efficient and\r\n\r\ncost-effective way of obtaining public feedback.  I  agree  with\r\n\r\nher.   In  fact,  MTI  and  its statutory  boards  have  already\r\n\r\nestablished links in our Internet home pages to allow members of\r\n\r\nthe public to e-mail us their feedback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Mr Tay Beng Chuan's question on further\r\n\r\nretrenchments which may arise despite the cost-cutting measures,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to allow time for some cost-cutting measures  to  work\r\n\r\ntheir way through to the economy.  Much depends on the state  of\r\n\r\nthe  US,  European and our regional economies.  As a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfact,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neven  in normal times when our economy was growing strongly,  we\r\n\r\nwere experiencing something like 9,000 to 10,000 retrenchments a\r\n\r\nyear.  So the figure of 20,000 should be seen in that context as\r\n\r\nwe restructure our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure Members that the Government is closely\r\n\r\nmonitoring  the economy and will not hesitate to take additional\r\n\r\nmeasures if the economic situation warrants them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee made several suggestions to improve our indicators\r\n\r\nof  cost  competitiveness.   My Ministry  has  been  pursuing  a\r\n\r\nconstant  course of refinement.  For example, the Department  of\r\n\r\nStatistics will be re-basing the unit business cost index of the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector  on  the basis of  the  1993  input/output\r\n\r\ntables  which  provide the latest available cost and  industrial\r\n\r\nstructure of the Singapore economy.  This major exercise will be\r\n\r\ncompleted by the end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last Parliament sitting, Dr Lee asked for\r\n\r\nGovernment's response to the medium-term recommendations of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC).  In total,  the\r\n\r\nCSC  made over 300 medium-term recommendations.  Of these,  more\r\n\r\nthan 200 recommendations have either already been implemented or\r\n\r\nare  in  line with the work of the various Government  agencies.\r\n\r\nExamples   include  recommendations  to  further   develop   the\r\n\r\nfinancial services sector and the repositioning of the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Labour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now give Government's response to the remaining 100\r\n\r\nover specific medium-term recommendations.  This is shown in the\r\n\r\nhandout which has already been distributed to Members.  In  view\r\n\r\nof   the   time  constraint,  I  will  just  highlight   a   few\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first page, under \"Building World-Class Companies\",\r\n\r\nMembers   will   see  there  are  three  recommendations.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  basically agreed with all of them  and  Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings  is  actively pursuing these ideas,  for  example,  the\r\n\r\npossibility of employing expatriate talent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  head  our  GLCs, the possibility of a more generous  use  of\r\n\r\nemployee  stock  option  plans or performance-based  bonuses  to\r\n\r\nattract  and retain talented staff and also for Temasek Holdings\r\n\r\nto take a more proactive role in developing our GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same page, No. 6, there is this proposal to study\r\n\r\nthe tax implications of the employee stock option plan.  This is\r\n\r\nsomething that the Ministry of Finance needs more time  to  look\r\n\r\ninto.   But  it is something that the CSC has been pushing  very\r\n\r\nstrongly for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On item 4, there was a proposal to set up a Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  to oversee the development of technopreneurship.   As\r\n\r\nMembers  know, we have already done so and there is a  committee\r\n\r\nchaired  by  DPM Tony Tan with my colleague, BG George  Yeo,  as\r\n\r\nVice-Chairman.  BG George Yeo will be responding later on to all\r\n\r\nthe issues concerning R&D and technopreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members were to look at some of the other pages, on page\r\n\r\n4,  No. 16, there is this idea that we should reduce the quantum\r\n\r\nof  differential  premium payable for increases  in  plot  ratio\r\n\r\nabove  the  alienated ratio.  This is something  that  has  been\r\n\r\nagreed  to in principle and the Ministry of Law is looking  into\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 8, No. 34, Positioning Singapore as the Education\r\n\r\nand  Inter-Regional  Training Centre  in  Asia,  again  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  has  been agreed upon  and  the  EDB  has  been\r\n\r\nactively  promoting  the setting up of world-class  institutions\r\n\r\nhere by Insead and other universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 9, No. 45, to review the current concept of Free\r\n\r\nTrade Zones to allow FTZs to be designated at the company level,\r\n\r\nthis is something that has to be studied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item No. 48, Positioning Singapore as the healthcare hub of\r\n\r\nAsia,  that  is  a good idea and Government is actively  looking\r\n\r\ninto this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 10, at the bottom, concerning \"Tourism\", there are\r\n\r\na  number  of  suggestions that we develop  world-class  tourist\r\n\r\nattractions,  we set up a multi-agency committee  to  reposition\r\n\r\nSentosa into a world-class attraction, and so forth.  These  are\r\n\r\nall the ideas which we are actively looking into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 13, No. 69, the proposal to allow working from home\r\n\r\nusing  the Internet, that is also a good idea and I think should\r\n\r\nbe actively facilitated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 14, No. 74, to set up \"business incubator centres\"\r\n\r\nto  promote  new business concepts, this in fact has  been  done\r\n\r\nalready for the technology companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one last item. On page 17, No. 102, to provide\r\n\r\nadditional   funding  for  the  Innovation  Development   Scheme\r\n\r\nadministered by EDB, additional funds have in fact already  been\r\n\r\nprovided.     Members   may   want   to   look   through   these\r\n\r\nrecommendations at leisure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to move to the issues concerning\r\n\r\nregionalisation.  Several MPs have asked for further  incentives\r\n\r\nto  help  our companies expand into the region and beyond.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  already provides generous support  in  this  regard.\r\n\r\nBut  we will see what more we can do.  For example, TDB will  be\r\n\r\norganising  more  trade  missions  and  fairs.   TDB  has   also\r\n\r\nincreased its assistance to participants to cover 50% of  common\r\n\r\nexpenditure, up from 30% and for the construction of  stands  in\r\n\r\ntrade  fairs or for office rentals.  TDB overseas trade  offices\r\n\r\nalso  assist  SMEs  by linking them up with  potential  business\r\n\r\npartners.   They  are  able to help our businessmen  with  local\r\n\r\nlanguages and customs should they encounter any problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the export factoring facility provided under the\r\n\r\nLocal  Enterprise  Finance Scheme, local  enterprises  can  ease\r\n\r\ntheir  cash  flow when exporting overseas. The Productivity  and\r\n\r\nStandards  Board  (PSB)  also  operates  the  Business   Connect\r\n\r\nprogramme   to  facilitate  business  alliances  with   overseas\r\n\r\npartners as well as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  SG  Connect  Programme  which provides  business  matchings\r\n\r\nthrough  the Internet.  EDB administers the Overseas  Enterprise\r\n\r\nIncentive which exempts qualifying income from approved overseas\r\n\r\nprojects  for  up  to  10 years.  There  is  also  the  Overseas\r\n\r\nInvestment Incentive, as contrasted with the Overseas Enterprise\r\n\r\nIncentive.   This Overseas Investment Incentive  allows  capital\r\n\r\nlosses  from  approved overseas projects to  be  offset  against\r\n\r\ntaxable income in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also mentioned the Regionalisation Finance Scheme\r\n\r\nwhich  provides loans to local SMEs for the purchase of  assets,\r\n\r\nsuch  as factory and production equipment, to help them  set  up\r\n\r\noverseas  manufacturing plants to support  their  operations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  Government  shares  70%  of  the   risks   and\r\n\r\nparticipating banks, 30%.  The interest rate is 6.25%  or  6.75%\r\n\r\ndepending on the nature of the loan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies can also apply for either the double tax\r\n\r\ndeduction or the Trade Development Incentive scheme administered\r\n\r\nby TDB to help them explore new and emerging markets.  The Trade\r\n\r\nDevelopment Incentive (TDI) is a dollar-for-dollar grant scheme.\r\n\r\nBesides  covering the setting up of overseas marketing  offices,\r\n\r\nTDI  also  covers programmes such as franchising,  branding  and\r\n\r\nproduct designs.  Since the financial year 1996, a total of  250\r\n\r\ncases,  amounting to $11 million, have been approved for various\r\n\r\nTDI programmes covering markets all over the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, EDB has just introduced a three-pronged\r\n\r\ninitiative   to   help   local  companies   with   co-investment\r\n\r\ncollaboration and consolidation.  Under this initiative, a  $100\r\n\r\nmillion  fund  involving  both  Government  and  private  sector\r\n\r\nparticipation  will take short-term equity stakes  in  promising\r\n\r\nlocal  enterprises  to  support the  expansion  plans  of  these\r\n\r\ncompanies.  I will ask the EDB to study whether they  can  apply\r\n\r\nthis  also  to  PLEs which are making acquisitions overseas,  as\r\n\r\nsuggested by some Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already in place initiatives to encourage globalisation\r\n\r\nwhile enhancing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore's  position as a centre for activities.  For  example,\r\n\r\nto  encourage  companies  to  use  Singapore  as  their  trading\r\n\r\nheadquarters  base,  TDB administers the Approved  International\r\n\r\nTraders  and Approved Oil Traders schemes.  Many companies  have\r\n\r\nbeen  attracted  under  these schemes to  anchor  their  trading\r\n\r\nfunctions  in  Singapore  while having  overseas  operations  to\r\n\r\nsecure  the  supply sources, such as the processing  plants  and\r\n\r\nfactories  in  cheaper locations.  This is to answer  the  point\r\n\r\nraised by Mr Inderjit Singh about giving incentives to the local\r\n\r\noperations whilst enabling our companies to go regional.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to respond to the points made by Mr Simon Tay\r\n\r\nabout the WTO and what is our policy in this regard.  Under  the\r\n\r\nWTO's  built-in  agenda, members are already  committed  to  new\r\n\r\nnegotiations in agriculture and services beginning in Year 2000.\r\n\r\nThe issue is therefore not whether there will be a new round but\r\n\r\nwhether the negotiating agenda will be a more comprehensive  one\r\n\r\nthat  includes  issues  beyond  the  built-in  agenda,  such  as\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce and industrial tariffs.  A comprehensive new\r\n\r\nround will ensure that the interests of all the WTO members  are\r\n\r\ntaken  into account.  It will also allow for trade-offs  in  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  sectors and facilitate negotiations  in  particularly\r\n\r\nsensitive  areas,  such as agriculture.   Singapore  supports  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive round.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WTO should focus on core trade issues and not get distracted\r\n\r\nby non-trade issues relating to labour and environment.  This is\r\n\r\nnot  because  we are shying away from these issues  but  because\r\n\r\nthey  often  serve as a guise for protectionism, as Mr  Tay  has\r\n\r\nmentioned,  and  we  are prepared to discuss these  issues,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  in  the  International Labour Organisation  where  the\r\n\r\nlabour issues properly belong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay asked about the help to the least developed countries.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  committed  to maintain  tariffs  at  0%  for  100\r\n\r\nproducts  of export interests to the least developed  countries.\r\n\r\nSingapore also conducts training courses to help\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries in opening up their markets and  in  coping\r\n\r\nwith  the  requirements of WTO.  For example, there is a  course\r\n\r\ngoing on right now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I will move on to the issues concerning the small and\r\n\r\nmedium  enterprises.  Here, I would like to inform Members  that\r\n\r\nPSB will be conducting a review of the SME masterplan to develop\r\n\r\na  SME  21 blueprint to position our SMEs to meet challenges  of\r\n\r\nthe  21st  century.  The study will incorporate inputs from  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector and will be launched later this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB is the key agency tasked to develop our SMEs. This is in\r\n\r\nresponse to Dr Wang Kai Yuen and a few others who asked  whether\r\n\r\nwe  should have a central agency.  My own assessment is that PSB\r\n\r\nis  the  right body to do it and they are doing their  best,  of\r\n\r\ncourse   with   the  help  of  the  private  sector   and   with\r\n\r\ncontributions  from  everybody.  Since its  inception  in  April\r\n\r\n1996,  the  PSB's First-Stop Centre has rendered  assistance  to\r\n\r\nover   11,000   cases  in  such  areas  as  finance,   operation\r\n\r\nimprovements,  market expansion, IT development  and  technology\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   PSB has further simplified its application  forms\r\n\r\nfor  SDF, LEFS and Local Enterprise Technical Assistance  Scheme\r\n\r\n(LETAS).  These forms should be available soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh's suggestion to farm out the processing of\r\n\r\nassistance schemes to industry bodies is already being done  for\r\n\r\nLETAS and can be further extended where appropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we are keen to develop our SMEs and local enterprises, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to reiterate that this should not reduce our efforts\r\n\r\nto  continue  to remain relevant to MNCs.  We have  had  a  very\r\n\r\nsuccessful  partnership  with  the  MNCs  which  bring  us   the\r\n\r\ntechnology, the market expertise and this is something  that  we\r\n\r\nshould build on.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members asked whether the SDF can be used for training of\r\n\r\nmanagers and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexecutives.  The answer is yes, if it is, for example, under the\r\n\r\nSDF's Total Company Training Plan, where executives can also  be\r\n\r\ncovered.   SME managers also qualify for SDF support  under  the\r\n\r\nSME  Manager Scheme, enjoying a grant level of up to 80%.   This\r\n\r\nis  an important area because one of the problems of the SMEs is\r\n\r\nthe  managerial expertise.  We found, for example, that some  of\r\n\r\nthe   companies  do  not  place  enough  emphasis  on  financial\r\n\r\nmanagement.  They may be selling off products but they  are  not\r\n\r\ncollecting  the money back or managing their finances  properly.\r\n\r\nIf through our help here we can improve the level of management,\r\n\r\nI think that will be a great help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the Promising Local Enterprises, I would like to\r\n\r\nassure  Mr Ahmad Magad that we do not look only at the  turnover\r\n\r\nor  the  size of the company.  We also look at their  potential,\r\n\r\nwhether they have capabilities in niche areas and both the  PSB,\r\n\r\nwhich deals with the smaller companies as well as the EDB, which\r\n\r\ndeals  with the larger local enterprises, are eager to help  our\r\n\r\ncompanies  to build up, to go regional and hopefully become  our\r\n\r\nown MNCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on issues concerning the Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise  Finance Scheme (LEFS).  In response to the  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis, the Government enhanced the LEFS scheme twice last year.\r\n\r\nThe  enhancements are aimed at helping more SMEs  obtain  short-term  loans to ease their cash flow.  The results show that  the\r\n\r\nenhancements are practical and effective.  The take-up rate  for\r\n\r\nshort-term  loans has increased significantly.   Loan  approvals\r\n\r\nfor  working capital, for example, increased by more  than  ten-fold  for  the period April 1998 to January 1999 as compared  to\r\n\r\nthe  same  period in 1997.  Similarly, factoring loans  approved\r\n\r\nrose   six-fold  with  about  $200  million  extended  to  local\r\n\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs have called for the Government to reduce the\r\n\r\ncurrent  interest rate for LEFS.  Members may recall  that  when\r\n\r\nthe  prime  lending rate was increased to 7.5% last  year,  LEFS\r\n\r\nrates  were  not adjusted.  The current LEFS interest  rates  of\r\n\r\n6.25% for short and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmedium-term loans and 6.75% for long-term loans are  still  very\r\n\r\nattractive, compared to prevailing interest rates for commercial\r\n\r\nloans  to SMEs.  Typically, they may have to pay something  like\r\n\r\n10%  for  their  loans if they are able to get  the  money  from\r\n\r\ncommercial  banks.   So  the  rate of  6.25%  is  actually  very\r\n\r\nattractive.   I therefore do not propose to lower  the  interest\r\n\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LEFS is intended to provide funds to SMEs, not to subsidise\r\n\r\ntheir  operations  through lower interest rates.   In  fact,  as\r\n\r\nMembers  may be aware, Singapore is enjoying some of the  lowest\r\n\r\ninterest rates at the moment.  The data I have here is from  the\r\n\r\nBusiness  Times  On-Line.   The Singapore  prime  rate  for  the\r\n\r\naverage  of  12  banks is 5.91%.  So the rate of 6.25%  is  just\r\n\r\nfractionally  about the prime rate.  In fact, there  is  no  way\r\n\r\nthat  SMEs can borrow at the prime rate or at this kind of rates\r\n\r\nfrom other banks.  Our rates compare very favourably with rates,\r\n\r\nfor  example, in Taipei, 8.8%; Hong Kong, 10%; New  York,  8.5%;\r\n\r\nLondon,  7.25%.  These are all prime rates.  Our rates are  much\r\n\r\nlower  than,  say, Bangkok, 14.75%; Manila, 22.9%  and  Jakarta,\r\n\r\n28%.   We  are  higher  than the rate in Tokyo  which  is  2.6%;\r\n\r\nZurich,  3.25%  and Frankfurt, 4.5%.  Actually we  are  enjoying\r\n\r\nvery  low  interest rates at the moment, reflecting the strength\r\n\r\nof our currency and the strength of our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin spoke about the logistics sector\r\n\r\nwhich is very important and we are putting a lot of emphasis  on\r\n\r\nthis area to see how we can enhance our role in this area.   The\r\n\r\nstrategy  is  to enhance our cost competitiveness and  logistics\r\n\r\ncapabilities    through    the   development    of    integrated\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and processes, grooming of world-class workforce,\r\n\r\nattracting  hub projects and internationalising local companies.\r\n\r\nBesides  helping  local companies to grow, we need  and  welcome\r\n\r\nforeign participation in this industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Board is taking a two-pronged approach to\r\n\r\ngrow  this sector.  First, to establish Singapore as a logistics\r\n\r\nhub  for the region, TDB helps local and international companies\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nestablish  their foothold in the region so that  they  can  also\r\n\r\nundertake  the  physical handling in these  regional  locations,\r\n\r\nwhile  continuing to use Singapore as a centre for  control  and\r\n\r\nvalue-added.   Secondly,  to attract international  distributors\r\n\r\nand  procurement  houses  to locate  in  Singapore.   This  will\r\n\r\nenlarge  the  pool  of  cargo  interest  in  Singapore,  thereby\r\n\r\nexpanding  networking opportunities for locally-based  logistics\r\n\r\nplayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for incentives, this is something we have to look into.\r\n\r\nWe  already have the Approved International Traders and Approved\r\n\r\nOil  Traders  and other schemes.  We should see whether  we  can\r\n\r\napply some of these to our local companies as well.  I think  in\r\n\r\nfact some of the local firms have already qualified, if I am not\r\n\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I will comment briefly on the question of industrial\r\n\r\nland pricing.  In pricing of industrial land, we have adopted  a\r\n\r\nmarket-based  approach so as to ensure efficient allocation  and\r\n\r\nusage  of  this  scarce resource.  We have a  policy  of  steady\r\n\r\nrelease  of  industrial land to allow for long-term planning  by\r\n\r\nindustrialists  as well as to moderate land  prices.   For  this\r\n\r\nyear, we are proceeding with the industrial land sales but  with\r\n\r\na  reduced  quantum  in view of the current situation  of  ample\r\n\r\nsupply.   JTC's posted rentals for industrial land and factories\r\n\r\nare back to levels of the early 1990s.  We have also taken steps\r\n\r\nto   lower   annual   escalation  of  land  rentals.    Wherever\r\n\r\nappropriate, industrial developments are allowed to go beyond  a\r\n\r\nplot ratio of 2.5.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of subletting, JTC and HDB properties are let\r\n\r\nout  to  companies  for them to carry out their  own  industrial\r\n\r\nactivities.  However, in view of the current economic  slowdown,\r\n\r\nJTC  is prepared to consider carefully, on a case-by-case basis,\r\n\r\nrequests  for subletting beyond the approved limits.  For  FY98,\r\n\r\nJTC has so far approved 379 new sublet cases that exceed the 50%\r\n\r\nspace sublet limit on a temporary basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the increasing integration of manufacturing\r\n\r\nproduction and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanufacturing-related   services,   many   manufacturing-related\r\n\r\nactivities   such  as  product  design  and  testing,   software\r\n\r\ndevelopment, IT support are already allowed in normal industrial\r\n\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The URA has also announced a further relaxation of\r\n\r\nallowable uses within industrial buildings.  Ancillary services,\r\n\r\nincluding office-related activities, are now allowed to take  up\r\n\r\nto 40% of the space in an industrial building.  Storage can also\r\n\r\nbe  included as part of the predominant production space, making\r\n\r\nup the other 60%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I just want to comment on this issue of\r\n\r\ndesalination  raised  by  Prof. Low.   Before  recommending  the\r\n\r\ntechnology for our first 30 million gallons per day desalination\r\n\r\nplant,  PUB's  consultants  had  reviewed  comprehensively   all\r\n\r\navailable technologies.  For the first phase of our desalination\r\n\r\nproject,   it  is  important  to  use  a  reliable  and   proven\r\n\r\ndesalination technology.  Distillation technology is a tried and\r\n\r\nproven process for large-scale desalination plants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverse Osmosis technology has potential for improvements\r\n\r\nwith  regard to its application in tropical waters where fouling\r\n\r\nof  membranes  is a key concern.  In addition,  the  RO  process\r\n\r\nrequires a higher degree of pre-treatment of raw sea water.   To\r\n\r\nbetter  assess  the suitability of RO for use  in  Singapore,  a\r\n\r\nsmall RO plant of 1 mgd will be built as part of the first phase\r\n\r\nof  our desalination project.  Depending on the outcome of tests\r\n\r\non the plant, RO will be considered for subsequent phases of the\r\n\r\ndesalination project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB is also keeping abreast of the latest developments in\r\n\r\ndesalination   technology,  including   the   tender   for   the\r\n\r\ndesalination  plant  to  be  built at  Tampa  Bay,  Florida.   A\r\n\r\ndecision  on  the  award of the tender is  still  pending  since\r\n\r\nbidding  closed  in  December 1997 due to several  issues,  cost\r\n\r\nbeing  one  of  them.  PUB will continue to monitor  the  latest\r\n\r\ndevelopments in desalination technologies to assess if these can\r\n\r\nbe applied in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Yeo):</b> Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Zulkifli, Dr Wang Kai Yuen and\r\n\r\nMr  Ong Kian Min spoke on the development of a knowledge economy\r\n\r\nin    Singapore,   especially   the   fostering   of   high-tech\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, R&D and e-commerce.  We are grateful for their\r\n\r\ndetailed  recommendations which MTI and MTI agencies will  study\r\n\r\nand carefully consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One crucial area for the development of a knowledge economy\r\n\r\nis  the  availability  of talent.  And we,  in  Singapore,  must\r\n\r\nappreciate  the  fact  that we are not  Israel,  we  are  not  a\r\n\r\ncontinental nation, we have a small population base, and that if\r\n\r\nwe can make an achievement in this area, we need many foreigners\r\n\r\nto  help us, some living overseas, some living here.  Yesterday,\r\n\r\nwhen  Dr  Tan Cheng Bock said that at a time of economic crisis,\r\n\r\nwe should think Singapore first, I think we must be careful at a\r\n\r\ntime  like this not to send wrong signals to our foreign friends\r\n\r\nand to our foreign partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we welcome them. They live among us. We work\r\n\r\nin  the same offices.  We are neighbours.  We meet in the hawker\r\n\r\ncentres  and restaurants.  And it is crucial that while  we  are\r\n\r\nfriends with them in good times, we remain friends with them  in\r\n\r\nbad  times.   It  is in a crisis that the true  character  of  a\r\n\r\nperson comes forth.  Very often, when we assess our friends, the\r\n\r\npeople  whom we work with, we watch them in a crisis.   Do  they\r\n\r\nturn  selfish and inwards?  Do relationships suddenly  sour,  or\r\n\r\nwill  they  continue  to share and feel a sense  of  solidarity?\r\n\r\nPrecisely, at a time like this, when we need many foreigners  to\r\n\r\nhelp  us to take our economy to the next phase, we must not send\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  signals.  Yes, in the short-term, some  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  be pleased that we are protecting them.  We save them from\r\n\r\nforeign competition.  But such an emotional line of attack would\r\n\r\ndo  great disservice to Singapore and to ourselves in the  long-term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin asked about our efforts to combat the Y2K\r\n\r\nbug.    He  cited  the  Garner  Group  report  which  said  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSMEs  were  not very well prepared and that we have  significant\r\n\r\ncross-border  problems, meaning that many of our neighbours  are\r\n\r\nmuch  less  prepared than we are.  In fact, we have started  our\r\n\r\nplanning  for  the  Y2K  problem way in advance  of  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries.   In  November 1996, NCB launched its Y2K  Conversion\r\n\r\nCampaign.  And many of the larger agencies in Singapore, all the\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies, statutory boards, are well prepared.   Our\r\n\r\nSMEs  continue to be less prepared, but I think this is a world-wide  problem, because the problems are of a smaller  scale  and\r\n\r\nsometimes it is hard for them to see how the Y2K problem affects\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCB has a Local Enterprise Computerisation Programme which funds\r\n\r\nup  to  70% of the consultancy cost for SMEs, but not many  have\r\n\r\ntaken  up this offer.  But we have got to keep pushing,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  got  to work with our regional partners.  So some  of  you\r\n\r\nmight  have  read in the Straits Times yesterday  that  APEC  is\r\n\r\norganising a conference next month which will bring together 300\r\n\r\nexperts from the region, including experts from the World  Bank,\r\n\r\nOECD  and  the Asian Development Bank, and they will  also  talk\r\n\r\nabout  the  problem of SMEs.  This APEC meeting is sponsored  by\r\n\r\nCanada, Japan and Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, on the whole, we should not be unduly alarmed.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  should  do,  we have done.  We  should  not  have  too\r\n\r\napocalyptic a vision of what the Y2K bug can cause.  I  remember\r\n\r\none  day  going  home, my 8-year old son asked  me  whether  his\r\n\r\ndigimon  will be affected.  I do not know who briefed him  about\r\n\r\nthe  Y2K bug.  But, obviously, there are a lot of misconceptions\r\n\r\nand  misperceptions  of what it means.  So,  we  should  not  be\r\n\r\nunduly  alarmed  but,  at  the  same  time,  we  must  take  all\r\n\r\nprecautions.  Because in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  nature of the problem, it is not what we are aware of which\r\n\r\nwill trip us up.  It is the things that we are not aware of.  As\r\n\r\nthe Chinese say, \"bu pa yi wan, zhi pa wan yi\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also remember that because the entire world is focused\r\n\r\non  this  problem, there will be herd effects.  Mass  psychology\r\n\r\ncan  become  important.  If everyone decides not to fly  on  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary or 31st December, then maybe half the world's aeroplanes\r\n\r\nwill not be flying.  And where will they be parked?  Because, at\r\n\r\nany  one time, half the world's aeroplanes are flying.  In  some\r\n\r\ncities, there may be a panic rush to withdraw money from  banks,\r\n\r\nin  which case the money supply will have to be increased.   But\r\n\r\nthese   are  problems  which  we  should  anticipate.   Scenario\r\n\r\nplanning,  contingency planning, is being done  by  the  various\r\n\r\nagencies,  and I am glad to report that, on the whole, Singapore\r\n\r\nshould be quite well prepared for the Y2K problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is 6.15 pm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon, Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and\r\n\r\ntook the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to report that the\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Supply has made further progress on the  Estimates\r\n\r\nof  Expenditure for the financial year 1999/2000, and ask  leave\r\n\r\nto sit again tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Lee Yock Suan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Fifteen</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Minutes past Six o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
