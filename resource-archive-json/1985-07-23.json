The petition asks the House to declare its privileges and, particularly, the question whether any proceeding before the House or a Committee can be questioned outside the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petition is from one Mr Sivadas s/o Sankaran who resides at No. 7, Lorong 7, Toa Payoh #02-245. The petition, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, relates to an action brought by nine persons against Mr Sivadas s/o Sankaran in respect of a memorandum that Mr Sivadas submitted to a Committee of this House. That Committee was the Select Committee appointed to consider the Companies (Amendment) Bill. Arising out of his representation to that Committee, he was subsequently sued in the High Court in respect of his representation made to the Select Committee. Mr Sivadas now asks this House to declare its privileges in respect of proceedings in the House and, particularly, whether his proceeding, and submission of a memorandum is a proceeding in the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> House, can be questioned elsewhere outside this House.

It is signed by Mr Sivadas, and perhaps I should have said that the Clerk has certified that it is in accordance with paragraph (5) of Standing Order 17 which deals with petitions.

Mr Ng Kah Ting. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FIRST OPEN MOBILIZATION EXERCISE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Report)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (a) whether the first Open Mobilization exercise was a success; (b) what were the shortcomings encountered and how does his Ministry propose to overcome them; (c) whether reservists will be allowed to keep a set of uniforms with them all the time; and (d) what steps his Ministry plans to take to improve on such exercises in regard to reducing the time taken to report to camp. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, assessed against the objectives, the Open Mobilization exercise was a success. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its first objective was to test the use of codewords. The second was to evaluate the system of activating units through radio, television, Rediffusion and cinema announcements. The third was to assess how well the mobilization centres could receive and manage reservists reporting at a fast pace, and how accurately and speedily they could report the progress to higher levels. The last objective was to have reservists and members of the public understand the Open Mobilization system, and know the part each has to play. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All systems functioned smoothly. The reservists were highly motivated and supportive. Many reported early, even though they were working the night shift or attending night classes. More than 90% had reported within four hours, and 97% responded by the six-hour deadline. It testifies to the fine spirit of the reservists, their families, their employers and the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No significant shortcomings were encountered, but some details have to be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> improved. For example, the announcements of the Open Mobilization over television and radio should be made more frequently. Also some mobilization centres, such as schools, did not have enough telephone lines and other facilities. Mindef will remedy these problems before the next exercise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main drawback of the exercise on the 8th July was that, with the pre-warning and the publicity, some realism had to be sacrificed. This was recognized even at the planning stage. But for the first exercise, it could not be helped. Some future exercises will be conducted without advance notice to test this aspect of the system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for allowing reservists to keep a set of uniforms with them all the time, it has been the SAF's practice for many years to issue each reservist two sets of combat uniforms. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the time allowed for the reservists to report to camp, Mindef does not presently intend to change the six-hour limit. Within this limit, it is up to each reservist to report back to his unit as quickly as possible. However, the exercises will progressively become more demanding, Besides being conducted without advance notice, some exercises will go beyond reservists simply reporting back to camp. The reservists will also have to load up their stores and equipment and deploy their units in the field, as if for real operations. The aim, of course, is to field a fully ready fighting force in the shortest possible time. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, while it is very heartening to receive the report from the Hon. Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry on the success of the first Open Mobilization scheme, will future exercises be conducted in such a way as to test the full preparedness of our reservists? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the answer is yes. For the first exercise, it was necessary for us to give pre-warning and publicity because the public had to be made aware of the nature of the exercise and what was expected of them. Otherwise, there would have been alarm and confusion which would have been highly undesirable.

Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Mr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many existing 3-, 4- and 5-room Housing and Development Board flat owners have applied to upgrade to bigger flats; and (b) what is the rationale for not reducing the respective levy on resale of flats by owners upgrading to bigger HDB flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as at 31 March 1985, 17,573 existing 3-, 4- and 5-room HDB flat owners have applied to upgrade to bigger flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer question (b), Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me first remind the House of the objective of the Government's \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> public housing programme. It is to provide decent homes for Singaporeans. The Government never intended HDB flats to be bought and sold purely for business gains. Thus, when resale of flats was first permitted, those who upgraded to bigger flats had to sell their first flats back to the HDB at the original selling prices. Nobody was allowed to profit from the resale of HDB flats. This policy was in force for 15 years from 1964 to 1979. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the policy was relaxed in August 1979 to allow HDB owners to re-sell their flats to buyers of their own choice, a cream-off rate of 5% was levied to prevent excessive profits. This rate, however, proved to be inadequate, resulting in excessive profiteering in some cases. A graded levy based on flat type was consequently imposed from September 1982. While the graded levy has been successful in curbing excessive profits, it has had the undesirable side-effect of preventing owners of bigger flats from upgrading to Executive and HUDC flats or moving into private housing. To correct this anomaly, the resale policy was recently revised by the HDB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised policy is fair to all HDB and HUDC lessees. Owners of bigger flats will benefit from the revision as they can now pay 10% more for their second flats instead of paying a 20-30% levy on the resale price of their first flat. At the same time, owners of smaller flats who could previously pay a small levy of 10-15% of the resale price can continue to pay the same levy when they upgrade to bigger flats. This benefit is not taken away from them. In absolute terms, owners of smaller flats pay a smaller sum when upgrading to bigger flats as compared with owners of bigger flats. For example, a 3-room flat owner pays a levy of $3,000-$4,000 as against the $12,000-$15,000 premium a 5-room flat owner has to pay when both are upgrading to Executive flats. Owners of smaller flats therefore have not lost out after the revision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all policy revisions since 1979, there has been one underlying principle, that is, people are allowed to enjoy the full subsidy only once. This explains why flat owners who move into private housing are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> permitted to retain their profits, while those who buy a subsequent flat must pay either a levy on the first flat or a premium for the subsequent flat. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing the resale policy, the HDB had considered the possibility of reducing the rates of levy as suggested by the Member for Bo Wen. However, the revised policy just implemented was found to be the better one, in that lessees are allowed to choose the option that is more advantageous to them. Had the HDB decided to reduce rates, it is likely that only the rates for bigger flats would be decreased. No adjustment would have been made to the rates for smaller flats since the present levy for these flats is already small. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the Hon.

This resale levy is not a capital gains tax. In fact, I have stated in my answer quite clearly that anybody who moves into private housing is allowed to retain all the profits. So there is no tax imposed on him. It is only when a flat owner asks for a second flat, which means that he is asking the Government to provide a second subsidy, then a levy or a premium is imposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, would the Hon.

As many letters contained more than one point, it is more meaningful to talk in terms of the number of times a particular subject is raised. A total of 294 items were raised by the writers during the period. The distribution of the items by subject is as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social and Community Matters, eg, welfare services, Medisave, constitute 56 times, or 19% of the 294. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land Transport, eg, car ownership, public transport, 54 times or 18%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic and Labour Matters, eg, the business climate, CPF, 54 times, or 18%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing, eg, HDB regulations, estate maintenance, 29 times or 10%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political and Legislative Matters, eg, Parliamentary debates, 22 times or 8%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security and Crime Matters, eg, Total Defence, unlawful activities, 16 times or 5%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Policy Matters, eg, developing patriotism, 23 times or 8%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeals, eg, hawker licences, 22 times or 8%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints, eg, traffic summonses, poor service by Government departments, 18 times or 6%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subjects raised can be classified into three types. The first type consists of feedback on national policies, issues and problems. These form 86% of the total input that we received. This shows that people are fully aware of the objectives and the reasons why the Feedback Unit \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> was set up, ie, to process feedback on national issues, policies and problems with a view to resolving them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the suggestions have been or will be considered. They have to be carefully evaluated against the overall perspective and long-term implications. For example, feedback on the current state of the economy and suggestions on how to improve it are referred to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. But the analysis of all the suggestions take time. Both the Feedback Unit and the Ministries concerned will bear them in mind in their future policy deliberations. I hope that members of the public will continue to write to the Feedback Unit giving their suggestions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type consists of appeals. These are from people whose applications for various things, such as hawker licences and work permits, have been turned down. The writers would like their cases to be reconsidered or be given special consideration. As I mentioned earlier, these cases only form 8% of the total input.

This assumption is incorrect. The increased reserves do not represent accumulated profits. PUB has two main reserve funds, the \"General Reserve\" and the \"Other Reserve\". These reserves are generated for specific purposes, The General Reserve, which stood at $88 million as at the end of 1984, was used as working capital for PUB. The Other Reserve of $120 million is used to finance the fuel stocks held by PUB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB has to collect enough revenue to break even. It must not only meet its operating expenses, but must also finance part of its development expenditure. In the last decade, PUB has been able to finance only 55% of its development expenditure. It had to borrow the balance from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, among other sources. On these loans, it had to pay market interest rates. To remain creditworthy, PUB must stay solvent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand PUB's financial position more clearly, we should look at its Revenue Account rather than its Balance Sheet. In 1984, PUB collected $1.7 billion in revenue and paid $1.5 billion in operating expenses, leaving a gross operating surplus of $215 million. Out of this operating surplus, it had to pay non-operating expenses of $44 million, loan repayments \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of $141 million, and development expenditures of $21 million, leaving a balance of net income of only $8 million. The figures do not quite add up because of rounding. This $8 million represents a margin of less than 0.5% of the total revenue of $1.7 billion. With this negligible margin, it is clear that, unless there is a further drop in the price of fuel oil, there is no basis for the PUB to reduce its tariffs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TAXIS AND TAXI-DRIVERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Situation report)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. \n  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Defence what is the latest situation on taxis and taxi-drivers with regard to (i) taxi-drivers' earnings; (ii) commuters' complaints; and (iii) the number of taxis on the road. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Defence (Dr Yeo Ning Hong):</b> Sir, surveys by ROV, NTUC Comfort and taxi companies of some 600 single-shift and 1,400 two-shift taxis for the month of June 1985 showed that taxi drivers were earning more than before the fare adjustments in April.

At a later date, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> its use will be extended to include the 4-digit numbers game. This will take into account the need to prevent proliferation of betting systems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation of the computerized system is simple but requires the use of telephone lines. Singapore Pools therefore intends to locate the electronic terminals within the premises of shops located in the vicinity of its current sales booths and to have the terminals operated by agents on a part-time basis. This will allow the phasing out of the manual sales booths, Present plans are to install 150 terminals which will displace the existing 169 sales points. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to computerize the Toto and 4-digit games implies no significant change in Government's policy towards gambling. Government recognizes that the urge to have a flutter, whether it be Toto, 4-digit, or horse-racing, cannot be totally eliminated from human nature. Far better that some controlled legal outlets be provided than to allow the urge to be satisfied by illegal operators. The proposed 150 electronic terminals will allow adequate access for those who wish to play the games.

I would like to circulate this Report to Members of the House for their information. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies of Report circulated to Members.] \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like now to highlight the key features of the measures that have been taken to prevent a recurrence of a similar accident. \n  <br>\n  <br>SAFETY MEASURES \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee agreed to all the safety measures recommended by the Commission. In one particular instance, the Committee has decided for added safety to have additional constraints. This \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> concerns the movement of vessels in the Height Restricted Area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <i>Height Restricted Area</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission of Inquiry recommended the establishment of a Height Restricted Area within Keppel Harbour, and that only vessels up to 48 metres in height be allowed freely into the Height Restricted Area. For vessels above 48 metres, the Commission recommended that they must obtain the prior written approval of the Port Master before they can enter or manoeuvre within the Area. In addition, the Commission recommended that movements of such vessels should only be permitted when the tide is not flowing towards the cableway and provided there are sufficient tugs for use during an emergency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <i>Maximum Height Restriction</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee agreed with the Commission on the extent of the Height Restricted Area and that vessels up to 48 metres in height be allowed freely into the Area. For added safety, the Committee further recommended the following additional restrictions for the Height Restricted Area: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) No vessel above 52 metres in height be permitted in the Area; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Vessels above 52 metres in height should not be constructed in the Area; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Only vessels of heights between 48 metres and 52 metres be permitted in the Area provided: (i) prior written approval is given by the Port Master; (ii) the height of the vessel has been verified by one of the Classification Societies; (iii) the height has been counter-checked by the PSA using a measuring instrument; and (iv) the master of the vessel has given an undertaking that the height of the vessel will not exceed 52 metres throughout the period of the vessel's stay within the Height Restricted Area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the promulgated height of the cableway at 56.5 metres, the Committee's recommendation will ensure that the cableway will be protected from tall vessels. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <i>Prohibited Area</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission of Inquiry also recommended the imposition of a Prohibited Area within the Height Restricted Area stretching 200 metres on either side of the cableway and in which no vessel above 48 metres will be permitted to encroach into. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's more stringent recommendation regarding the Height Restricted Area, in effect means that the whole Height Restricted Area has become a Prohibited Area for vessels above 52 metres. It is no longer necessary to have the Prohibited Area as recommended by the Commission. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <i>Other Safety Measures</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSA has also upgraded its Marine Emergency Action Procedure to include emergencies threatening the cableway. This Action Procedure now includes rescue operations and evacuation of cable car passengers in case of emergencies threatening the cableway. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other safety measures recommended by the Commission have been implemented by the PSA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSA has also installed a system of visual checks using survey instruments at PSA Towers and Tanjong Pagar Complex. This check will confirm that vessels are below the specified height of 52 metres. PSA will upgrade this system into an independent and automatic laser detector system next year. \n  <br>\n  <br>LEGISLATION \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recommended by the Commission, the appropriate legislation will be amended to ensure scrupulous implementation of the height restriction system and the requirement for accurate information on the principal dimensions of vessels in documents submitted to the PSA. \n  <br>\n  <br>HEIGHT OF VESSELS AS A PRINCIPAL DIMENSION \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also submitted a paper to the 51st session of the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime Organization. The paper brings to the attention of the international body, the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> desirability of including the height of a vessel as a principal dimension in the vessel's plans and documents. This will highlight the need for all, who are responsible for the safe navigation of a vessel, to be aware of its height, and bring about greater safety for international shipping. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed to ask some points of clarification? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the assumption of this Report is that having the cablecar system is desirable and that the costs of diverting the vessels which are too high are minimal; now how true is this? Secondly, are there any suits in the courts outstanding against the PSA or relevant Government authorities for the loss of life and limb? And thirdly, is any insurance scheme being proposed for the cablecar network? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is possible by judicious allocation of berths to ensure that vessels above 52 metres do not come into the Height Restricted Area. So there will not be any significant inconvenience at all. Secondly, claims have been made against the three parties - the owners and insurers of the Eniwetok, Keppel Shipyard and the Port of Singapore Authority. Some of these claims have been settled, others are at different stages of settlement. Insurance had been taken by the appropriate authorities and companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the members of the Committee that was appointed to study the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry had accepted that there should be appropriate amendments to the Port of Singapore Authority Act, may I inquire of the Hon.

Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of the Bill is to enable a Day Release Scheme to be introduced for convicted prisoners. Under this Scheme, elected long-term prisoners can opt to serve the last 12 months prior to release in a pre-release camp. They will be released in the day to work for an outside employer and return to the camp in the evening. Where possible, they will be given training to equip them with necessary skills. Plans are therefore under way to provide prisoners with VITB-type of training courses, such as tiling, paving, plastering, to prepare them for jobs outside the prison. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill therefore will empower the Minister for Home Affairs to introduce such a Scheme for prisoners who are considered suitable to take up gainful employment while serving their sentences. The Bill provides for prisoners under the Scheme to be released daily to work outside the limits of any prison. The Minister is also empowered to make regulations for the purposes of the Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period when the convicted prisoners will work alongside ordinary workers, they will have the opportunity to prepare for normal life after release. It is hoped that it will also inculcate in them a sense of self-worthiness and social responsibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Day Release Scheme for convicted prisoners will also be made available to short-term prisoners serving a sentence of less than six months, such as fine defaulters. Owing to their short imprisonment, they are not able to fully participate in educational and training programmes in the prison. Neither can they be employed in SCORE's workshops in the prison because of the high turnover which disrupts production. The opportunity for fine defaulters to work and earn market wages will also provide them with \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> financial relief upon their release from prisons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in the Day Release Scheme for those eligible will be voluntary. They will be paid wages at market rates and also paid CPF allowances. They will also be covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act. They will be allowed to retain only sufficient money for fares and lunches and the balance of their wages will become compulsory savings, and with the prisoner's consent, their family members can draw from it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible prisoners will be considered for the Day Release Scheme by a Selection Committee chaired by a Justice of Peace. Prisoners with serious and violent criminal antecedents will not be considered for emplacement on the Scheme. Only those who are assessed to be capable of staying out of trouble and who do not pose a criminal or security threat will be selected. Prison officers furthermore will carry out spot checks on prisoners' conduct and behaviour at the worksites. Those who breach the conditions of the Work Order or involve themselves in crime will be immediately taken off the Scheme and sent back to the prison to serve out their term. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In introducing this Scheme, we are relying on our experience gained from the existing Day Release Schemes which were introduced for drug addicts in 1979, Criminal Law detainees in 1981 and Reformative trainees in 1982. The releasees under those Schemes commute daily to work in participating employers' factories outside the prisons and return to the prisons at the end of the day. They are paid wages at market rate as well as CPF allowances. More than 4,000 persons have successfully completed the Scheme since its inception. They were engaged either in construction work or in the manufacturing and service sectors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The records show that the recidivism rate of drug addicts who had gone through a stint on the Day Release Scheme is much -lower at 48.7%, as compared to 58.5% for those who did not. Similarly, for the categories of Criminal Law detainees and Reformative trainees, there is a lower recidivisim rate. As at 31st March 1985, 403 Criminal Law detainees and 77 Reformative trainees had successfully completed the Day Release Scheme. The relapse rates of Criminal Law detainees \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and the Reformative trainees are 8.8% and 23.3% respectively. Comparing these rates with those of convicted prisoners, which is 32.3%, we can conclude that such Day Release Schemes do help to facilitate the prisoners' reintegration into society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Scheme will be implemented by the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE), whose experience in providing jobs for prisoners, its existing administrative set-up, and its contacts with employers in the private sector will ensure the smooth and efficient implementation of this Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our penal system in Singapore is aimed at striking a balance between the deterrent factor and the rehabilitation factor. The mainstay of our rehabilitation strategy is the work programme. A statutory board, as I have said, has successfully been running vocational workshops within our penal institutions since 1976. The prisoners are paid market wages for the work done in the Day Release Scheme. Within the prison workshops, they are paid wages based on the level of skill pegged on graded performance. They can remit their savings home. Work as an ethos, discipline, self-image and responsibility towards the family are built up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides work therapy, the rehabilitation programme also includes education, recreation and religious activities. A comprehensive in-prison educational programme is manned by a Principal Education Officer and 14 officers from the Ministry of Education. Academic classes for the qualifying test of 'O' and 'A' levels are conducted to help those with potential. From 1981 to 1984, a total of 239 prisoners sat for the GCE 'O' level examinations in the three language streams. 122 of them passed the examination. For the same period, 19 prisoners sat for the GCE 'A' level examinations, of which one obtained a full certificate whilst the rest had one to three passes in subjects at principal level. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the introduction of Day Release Scheme for prisoners will, as with the other Day Release Schemes, bridge the gap between institutional life and their \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> release into free society. It will facilitate their reintegration into society to function as socially responsible and law-abiding citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think hon. Members would surely welcome this Bill as part of the effort to rehabilitate our prisoners. And as the Minister puts it very well, we seek to have a balance between the deterrent or punitive aspect of prison and the need for rehabilitation of prisoners. I also welcome the information he provided to this House in respect of the education, training and counselling that prisoners receive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, l need a few points of clarification on this Bill. As the Minister said in his speech, the scope for the day release scheme seems to be much more restricted than the Bill allows for. In other words, as I read the amendment Bill, it seems to allow any category of prisoners to be released, subject to the discretion of the Minister. I wonder whether that is his intention. As long as the Bill allows this, would the Minister consider allowing long-term prisoners to be put on this scheme to work outside, other than the last 12 months of their prison sentence? The fact that they are serving a long prison sentence means that there is considerable disorientation. And if these prisoners have shown that they are capable of good conduct over the years in prison, then surely they would be deserving of an earlier involvement in such a scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to seek assurance from him in regard to those prisoners who are denied access to this day release scheme. What avenues of appeal are available to the prisoners? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, there is the question of employment of ex-prisoners. What measures has the Government taken to help these ex-prisoners reintegrate into society? For example, are Government jobs open to ex-prisoners who have shown good conduct, who have managed to get further education and training while they were in prison? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I welcome the Bill and give it the support from my Party as well. May I ask the Minister a few questions, particularly regarding the terms and conditions of the engagement of prisoners? I see under the Bill that the Minister will prescribe, by regulations, the terms and conditions of engagement of these prisoners at their places of work. May I ask whether it is the intention that the Prison authorities should find the work for them? Or is it proposed that the prisoners themselves may apply for work at factories or at places of employment of their own choice? Is it the intention that the prisoners will be allowed to contract with the employers directly and secure the best bargain for themselves? Or will all this be regulated by the Prison authorities? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, about the wages paid to the prisoners who partake in this scheme, I understood the Minister to say that they will be paid market rates. Again, are these market rates to be fixed beforehand by the Prison authorities, or would they be a matter of negotiation in each particular case, ie, with each particular employer? Because if they are fixed beforehand, then they cease to be market rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I ask about the retention of part of the wages by the prisoners? The Minister has said that they would be allowed to retain part of it for the payment of food and travelling expenses. May I ask for what food consumed are they expected to make payment? Is it for the food consumed in the prison, or is it at the work place only? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, about the availability of the wages for the families of the prisoners. I understood the Minister to say that the rest of the wages, after paying for their food and travelling expenses, will be put into a compulsory savings account from which members of the family may be able to withdraw. I would ask that consideration be given to letting the family have the whole of the balance of the wages. I know of cases where the families have been very badly hit financially and embarrassed by finding the breadwinner in prison, suddenly. What is the objection to letting the family have the rest of the earnings without them having to make an applica- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tion for every specific need? Would the Minister consider that? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee (Kampong Chai Chee)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Bill has just been briefly explained by the Minister. This scheme will enable our prisoners to be trained to make a living when they are released from the prison and return to society. So it merits our support. But there are a few points to raise. In the past, the Minister has been a Minister for Labour and, therefore, he is quite familiar with this type of Bill. Since the Bill will allow the Minister to stipulate regulations to enable prisoners to go out to work, it is really too good. But the question is, if he goes out as a worker, what kind of worker do we regard him? I am not joking. Maybe some people will say that he is a captive labour. If he is getting the same rate of wages as other workers, that means we are recognizing the labour and effort that he is putting in. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Minister has neglected is the welfare benefit that such kind of workers should get. If there is any industrial accident, I would like to ask whether this kind of workers could get any benefit or compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act. They are actually workers because they are working outside the prison and not inside the prison. If they could get benefits of workmen's compensation when working outside, then by the same rationale those working inside the prison should also receive similar benefits. I would like to ask the Minister whether there is such a legislation. If not, whether he can provide such a legislation so that they may also benefit. Moreover, employers will also be required to insure them against any industrial accident. This is the first point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then since they are recognized as ordinary workers, if any accident should take place, or if there is any matter involving a worker's benefit, could any trade union have the right to represent them in a claim for any compensation or benefit? This is a fundamental question. What problems they face outside the prison may not be the same as those obtaining inside. Maybe the food in the factory is not too good, or such like problems. Can the unions do something on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> their behalf? I would like to ask whether such prisoners will have the right to claim equal treatment as ordinary workers outside. We should not neglect them just because of their prisoners' status. So I would like to ask the Minister whether in the proposed legislation there is any provision enabling trade unions within certain degrees to represent them and claim benefits for them. If they are union members, then it is a different matter. Further, if the employers would support the unions in their recruitment of membership drive, whether the unions can accept such workers as members? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members who have spoken. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the points raised by the Member for Whampoa first. His first question was whether long-term prisoners would be allowed to be released for periods longer than the last 12 months. We do not exclude this. But our approach is to first try this limited scheme and see how it works. Based on the experience after some time, l am prepared to consider expanding and improving the scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point on which the Member wanted clarification was whether, in the process of determining who can be selected for the day release scheme, there will be some method of giving persons who are not selected a method of lodging an appeal. This is a good point and I will ask my officials to look into providing such an avenue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Member wanted to know whether there are any efforts or steps taken to look into the welfare of prisoners after their release. I wish to assure him that this is being done, not only by the Singapore Aftercare Association but also through the Department in the Ministry of Community Development which is involved with the rehabilitation and counselling of prisoners. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the first point raised by the Member for Anson concerning the terms and conditions which would be the subject of regulations to be done subse- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> quently, he wanted to know whether it will be the individual prisoner who negotiates with the employers or whether it will be done by the relevant administering authority or the Prisons. The answer is that it will be done by the relevant authority which, in this case, will be SCORE. The reason is that it is the most practical solution to our problem because we must be confident of certain conditions, the place of work, the kind of employment, who he comes into contact with, the possibilities of contamination, escape and so on. Also, it has to be done on a fairly large bulk basis, and it will be very difficult to administer the scheme if every individual is a free agent to seek his own employment. Supervision will be very difficult. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's second point is the question as to wages and market rates and whether this will be negotiated, again, by the individual or by the administering authority. Here again, for practical purposes, it must be done by the administering authority in order to get employers, manufacturers or the service sector to participate in the scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is with regard to the retention of wages. He wanted to know the method in which the wages are retained. What actually happens is that the prisoner on the scheme opens an account with the POSB and the monies are credited to the POSB account. It gathers interest. He withdraws whatever money he needs that is allowed for his purposes, and the family is also allowed to withdraw the money. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His question, I believe, was also whether in certain cases where the family is in dire straits, whether we would allow the family to use the entire amount. My understanding is that we are not very rigid on this and in deserving cases we have, in fact, allowed the family to withdraw a considerable amount. I am not against the family withdrawing the entire amount if the prisoner consents to it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Chai Chee has asked certain interesting questions. First of all, his question was whether workmen's compensation would be applicable. The answer, as I have said in my Speech is, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> yes, workmen's compensation will apply to those released on the Day Release Scheme because they are working outside the prison. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether some sort of insurance or workmen's compensation scheme should apply within prisons, this is a separate matter which I am prepared to look into. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His question as to whether trade unions can organize and recruit, the answer to that is, of course, no. Because prisoners are convicted persons and are unlike any other law-abiding ordinary persons who have not been convicted. It makes a mockery of the whole system of arrest, punishment and incarceration if we remove all distinctions between prisoners and law-abiding citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Maj Fong, you have already spoken once in the debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee:</b> Just a clarification. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> All right. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee:</b> When I asked the question, I had in mind, just in case, some over-zealous employer taking too seriously the NTUC campaign on recruitment.

When I met them, the two parties had already agreed on their merger in Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. They released the announcement of the merger terms that same afternoon. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Prime Minister be good enough to say whether he saw them at their request, or whether they saw him at his request? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I saw them at the request of the two principal negotiators on both sides, the Times Publishing Berhad and the Singapore News and Publications Ltd, namely, Mr Lyndley Holloway and Mr Lee Hee Seng.

And were they then asked to initial or sign the agreement then and there? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> How the directors had kept the other members of the Board informed was not my business. I was asked to meet them because the two negotiators had earlier known of Government policy which I had made clear to them, namely, that there was going to be free and open competition between the two publishing houses. Let me explain. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times Group, in anticipation of competition, had pre-empted the market. It had monopolized or bought up all the syndicated rights to all the major publications in the English-speaking world - British, American, Australian, and so on. It had also bought up the best cartoons. It had also hired the best or the better journalists. There were, therefore, considerable obstacles to the Monitor breaking into the market. I made clear to both directors that the rules would allow for fair competition, that there could be no \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pre-emption by over-booking of syndicated articles or cartoons, and that there would be free bidding for the services of journalists, and that it was our intention to gradually allow a temporary inflow of foreign journalists to make up for the shortage of local ones. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two chief negotiators knew what perhaps some members of the Straits Times Group did not know - that, with free rules of competition, it was unlikely that the Monitor could ever be crushed as so many other newspapers had been crushed in the past. Of course, it would have been a long and costly business, but there were three banks on the side of the Monitor - the Overseas Union Bank, the United Overseas Bank, and the Development Bank of Singapore. There were also the resources of the daily revenues of the Chinese newspapers to back it. It would have gone on five, seven more years, but there was no crushing it like The Standard, The Tribune, The Herald. The Herald did not last. It was owned by a former Chief Minister of Sabah and I knew it, and he knew it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It was owned by his friend. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Because he owned it, I had no intention of allowing a Chief Minister of a friendly state to help his friends in Singapore. But some members of the Straits Times Group were under the impression that they could go for broke, and therefore, I was asked to confirm that that was the Government's position. I did so and, as far as I know, I needed no other words of persuasion to let them come to the obvious conclusion that they could either take up the cudgels and slog it out for five, seven or more years, and then share the market, or come to terms as best they can. It was not the Government's intention to back one side or the other. It was our intention that because of the change in the education policies, or rather, because of the options parents had exercised to send their children to English Language schools, two major Chinese newspaper groups, whose shareholders were primarily Chinese-educated, were going to lose their future readership. I, therefore, felt that we had an obligation to give them a look-in, into the future reader- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ship, and that the rules must allow them an entree into the English-speaking world. They chose to settle. It would have made no difference to the Government whether they slogged it out or they settled. We have enough powers to make sure that both play according to the rules of the game. I make no apologies for these powers. They are necessary. And Singapore has prospered and thrived because we have exercised these powers wisely and judiciously. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Do I understand the Prime Minister to be saying that he saw these two principal directors before the meeting on the llth of July and explained to them what his thinking was?

Yes, I did not see them together. I saw them separately. I made clear to each of them that there would be fair competition.

It is about Asian values in our society. Regrettably, the Member for Potong Pasir is not present now. On the llth July, in a speech to NUS students the Member for Potong Pasir said that we must definitely not keep the Asian feudalistic type of society as it would hold us back. Upon hearing that, one might think that there is one more champion in the anti-feudalism force and would applaud for it. This is because feudalism used to bring too much disaster in its trail, especially terminal feudalism in its dying throes, as it represents conservatism, retrogression and darkness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Member for Potong Pasir had exactly realized this psychology of the people to have dared to hoodwink the people by equating \"Asian feudalistic type of society\" with \"Asian values\" so as to confuse their thinking and then to advocate \"discarding Asian values\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his arguments, the Government is promoting Asian cultures and values for the sake of preserving its dictatorial role, and destroying the Opposition Party. This kind of argument is no different from his topsy-turvy type of logic about \"Asian values\" equalling \"Asian feudalistic society\". Does it mean that facts that are discernible by a million of our electorate could not be perceived by the Member for Potong Pasir? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our 26 years of nationhood, the political institution that we have been practising is parliamentary democracy. After every four or five years, the Government will have to face the electorate who have the absolute right to choose the government they like. The two Opposition Members for Potong Pasir and Anson have come into being precisely under this parliamentary polity. There is no gain-saying that parliamentary polity has been our political institution in practice. If the Member for Potong Pasir would choose to deny this fact, he would, in fact, be denying his own qualification as an MP, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has lumped \"feudalism\" and \"dictatorship\" together with Asian values, probably for two reasons. One reason is that he is naive and ignorant about Asian \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> values and the other is that he has an ulterior motive in trying to scoop in some political capital. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least two examples to show his ignorance of Asian values. Addressing some NUS students, he mentioned about the violent revolutions in Russia and China, and said that the way to prevent the overthrow of a government by force is not to advocate Asian values. I believe all those who have some knowledge of modern history would know that the revolutions in Russia and China were Communist-led and were carried out according to the Marxist,Leninist ideology of capturing political power by force of arms. This ideology originated from the West and has nothing whatsoever to do with Asian values at all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other example is this. In May this year, the Member for Potong Pasir in a speech used the story in a kungfu film where a selfish master would not teach his students all his kungfu movements to be-little Asian cultures and values. People have already made a laughing stock out of this shallow talk.Is this ignorant and flashy attitude not running against the \"humble and non-arrogant\" image that he has portrayed? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were it merely due to naivety and ignorance, the aberration might be corrected through learning. What is most abhorrent is ignorance topped up with ulterior motive which must need thorough uncovering and disclosure. Because if the erroneous concept were held by an ordinary person the harmful effect might not be too great. However, as it comes from a Member of Parliament, especially an Opposition leader who harangues about \"alternative government\", it becomes a serious matter. His thinking, his aberration and his ignorance, should they be put into effect one day, all our people will be affected adversely, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geographically, Singapore is situated in Asia. Our people are made up of Asian immigrants. Our forefathers came from China, India and the Malay archipelago with long cultural traditions. We treasure our cultural heritage. We have our unique customs and practices and we have our own precepts of socialization and human \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> relationship. The Asian values have enabled us to strike roots in Asian soil. Once the roots are extracted, we will be dispersed, floating around the four seas and become lost and confused. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the colonialists in colonial times dared not openly call out slogans for root destruction. We want to ask: on whose behalf is the Member for Potong Pasir making such calls? And why is he so brazenly audacious? Who has given him the right to demand that we sever our roots and forget our origin? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Member for Potong Pasir is somewhat befuddled with what Asian values are, let me touch upon it a little. The Asian value concept that we want to preserve and cultivate has nothing to do with any political institution. The concept is one of ethics; it is a social norm, the principle of human relationship and the foundation of family relationship. In one phrase, it pertains to the attitude of human behaviour. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our society, there is the propriety of order among members of the same family with mutual affection. It is the natural duty of the parents to bring up the children. Similarly, it is also the bounden duty of the children to look after their aged parents. Marriage is a life-long major event, not child's play. To give reins to unbridled carnal desires and free unethical sexual relationships is immoral. This sense of duty to one's family is in turn reflected in one's loyalty to the society and the nation. This is a body of time-honoured and tested valued precepts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of social development, certain retrogressive elements in Asian values, such as blind loyalty and blind filial piety and discrimination of the sexes favouring the male, have long since been discarded into the garbage dump of history. Furthermore, in preserving Asian values, we have been critical and selective in our judgment, adopting only the fine essence that is suitable to our national conditions and conducive to our national progress. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of Asian values that not only do not hinder but help in social and national development are not hard to find. The economic achievements of Japan \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are admired even by developed Euro-American countries alike. Similar examples of economic achievements can also be found in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore which are acclaimed as the \"four little dragons\" of Asia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we are clear headed. We do not blindly condemn things of the West in toto, as it has just been mentioned that our polity is that of parliamentary democracy, Besides, we are also vigorously imbibing advanced Western science and technology, including management methods. Also, the untiring spirit of quest and advancement of the West too merits our emulation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in respect of the attitude of human behaviour, there are fundamental differences between the Asians and the Western people. For instance, among the Western practices that we cannot accept are: the habit of children calling parents directly by their names; the pitiful settlement of aged parents in the Home for the Aged, etc. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another practical significance for advocating Asian values at this time. We are witnessing a current of ill-wind of faddish trends pervading in the Western countries where the youth like to put on outlandish dresses and romp and dance in the streets. They even take to drugs and unbridled carnal excesses. In their minds, there is only individual freedom but not social or national interest. Even the Western countries are worried about this queer and decadent trend. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in this world of mutual dependence and an age of fast developing communication and transportation, these social ills of the West have spread speedily to Asia. Towards the end of last month, the Asia Magazine weekly published some articles centering on the discussion of this problem. The articles pointed out that in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Asean countries, including Singapore, these roaming youths can be found in the shopping centres and the fast food centres. Thus, it can be seen that the appearance here in Singapore of the \"MacDonald kids\", \"Centrepoint kids\" and \"punks\" is not a problem that only \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> troubles us. But there are special characteristics in our situation. Ours is an open society. The majority of our youths are English educated. After the implementation of a unified stream of education system in 1987, English will become the first language and it can be foreseen that the influence of Western decadent fads will be greatly enhanced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it can be seen that the promotion of Asian values is a very timely move, as it is a correct measure to guide our younger generation towards the right path and is in keeping with the long term interest of our country. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposition of \"Discarding Asian Values\" by the Member for Potong Pasir other than meeting the liking of the lost youths and pleasing them, what other useful purpose can it achieve? To put forward this kind of proposition just to win over the support of a handful of people, it is really too selfish and too shallow in thinking. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to invite the Government leadership to express the stand of the Government on the question of Asian values so that our people-will see clearly the direction of our nation building. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Yatiman Yusof (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to add to the speech made by the Member for Khe Bong on the subject of values that should be made principles which the people should uphold and practise, a topic which has been the subject of discussion inside and outside Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History has confronted us with the reality of the existence of a multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-cultural Singapore because of Singapore's ethnic composition. Singapore has succeeded in achieving its present level of progress through the synthesis of the civilizations found in the Asian region. And what is more, Singapore is enjoying the fruits of its labour and progress as a result of the flux of western civilization. So it is imperative that we preserve this synthesis. From Eastern civilization which encompasses the civilizations of China, India and the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Malay Archipelago, and our presence and the arrival of our ancestors in Singapore has taught us the ways of life which are founded on these diverse values. Certainly, these values, be they from the East or West, comprise positive and negative elements. Nevertheless, such values, like the value that has become the tenet stressing the importance of family-living, respect for the elders, harmonious community way of living, where public interests supersede self-interests, hard work, and the quest for knowledge to the niche of the grave constitute some of the values that we inherit from these two cultural sources. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These values did not originate from just one civilization, but from civilizations which had been intertwined resultant from the amalgam of history among the races in Asia, and Singapore is the seedbed where such values blossom and flourish. Therefore, it is to our advantage if we could synthesize the values from West and East such as the democratic parliamentary system, the urge to engage in intense thinking, to be open-minded and rational in the face of challenges in order that we can rise to even greater heights of achievements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, history has ordained that we possess a diversified social and economic infrastructure. A combination of political and economic social infrastructure founded on the free enterprise system has brought Singapore to a high level of advancement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Second Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Second Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Ong Teng Cheong)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of Asian values in our society that we are discussing about should actually be clarified by the Member for Potong Pasir. What a pity that he is not in the House. Now I would just like to state the Government's stand on this question. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, those who are familiar with our history and understand our social and ethnic composition know that Singapore is a country strongly and deeply rooted in the Asian soil. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were an immigrant society to begin with. Our ancestors came from India, China and the Malay Archipelago which \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have long-standing cultural traditions behind them. Our ancestors have not only left for us a rich cultural heritage but have also passed on to us many precious, correct and useful values. These precious values have enabled us to transform a small barren island into a prosperous country. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being the case, what reasons have we to discard our own precious values? What reasons have we to forget our roots? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we should forget our roots, we shall become uprooted. Then, as the Member for Khe Bong has rightly pointed out, we shall be floating around the four seas and become lost and confused. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a plural Asian society. With the exception of a very small minority, we are Asians. Our hair is black and so are our eyes. So what we have chosen are the Asian values of our own. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not, however, deny that we should absorb from the Western society its advanced technology and modern management methods. We are walking on two legs, so to speak. We have the best of two worlds, the East and the West, and that is our way to success, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not, however, mean that we entirely negate all the Western values. Apart from parliamentary democracy, advanced technology and modern management methods, the West also has the positive spirit of striving and enterprise, worthy of our emulation. On the other hand, we do not blindly accept Asian values in toto. Asian values have been developing continuously over centuries. In the process, some of these values have become outdated and irrelevant to our society. These are the values that we must discard. What we want to promote are the values which are still applicable to the modern Asian society. These are the ethical and moral concepts of the Asians, the spirit of thriftiness and diligence. Thriftiness and diligence are the conditions for building up the national wealth. Moral and ethical values and proper human relations are the pillars of society. Asian values emphasize the personal moral character and a person's responsibility to society and the nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Confucian ethical thinking, \"The cultivation of the self leads to harmony in the family which, in turn, leads to a well-run country and peace under heaven.\" This is a good example to illustrate this point. Another example would be a saying of Mencius, \"The foundation of the nation lies in the family, and the foundation of the family lies in the individual self.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, it can be seen that the concept of the family is very strong among Asians. It is a natural obligation in life for parents to love their children and for children to be filial to their parents. The cultivation of the individual self is the foundation for forming the family and building up the nation. The family is the basic unit of society. When the country is destroyed, the family perishes with it, and when the family has perished, its people will fall apart. This is the main difference between Eastern values and Western values which tend to emphasize individualism and individual rights and privileges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country is too small. For survival, we have to adopt an open-door policy and build an open society. We have no means of preventing the onslaught of external influences. If we are not careful, we shall be unwittingly and easily engulfed in and overwhelmed by the dangerous waves of undesirable external influences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, in recent years, problems have emerged in the form of youths taking drugs and hell riding. Familial and human relations also seem to be going down the drain with gradually rising divorce rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has from time to time adopted administrative measures to counter the influence of undesirable culture coming from outside, but because we are an open society, it is not possible for such administrative measures alone to achieve the desired objective. The best way, therefore, lies in the cultivation of the individual self. The moral education - lessons on religion, Confucianism and ethics implemented in schools - is intended to bring up a better younger generation with proper values and correct outlook in life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, the promotion of Asian values and Oriental cultures is the best \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> way to counter the unhealthy foreign culture and protect the foundation of our society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a political party leader, the Opposition Member of Parliament has caused indignation among knowledgeable Singaporeans with his strong advocacy of throwing away Asian values. He has confused Asian values with the Asian feudalistic society. This shows his ignorance or superficial knowledge of Asian values. Otherwise, this would be a case of an attempt to fish in troubled waters with an ulterior motive. That he is prepared to sell out his own fine traditions and values for personal political objectives reflects clearly that he has been influenced by extreme individualism, thereby becoming a politician who is prepared to destroy his own roots and forget where he has come frorn, so long as the means justify the ends. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian values that we are advocating strongly and the lessons on Confucian ethics we conduct in schools are not intended to preserve the \"Asian feudalistic society\", as he has alleged. It is neither intended to teach our children the trick of keeping 10% of the martial art from the disciples, as he has alleged. The whole \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> purpose of moral education is to help our children understand the basic tenets of human behaviour, to build a good moral character and to improve human relations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bilingual education policy encourages the learning of the mother tongue. It is intended to enable us to balance Western culture with Eastern culture and to withstand the impact of Western culture, so that we can form a positive outlook in life. This has nothing to do with the political system. It is our long-term objective to build a society of excellence, an Asian society of a high degree of cultural cultivation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to build a rugged and flourishing Asian people with lofty ideals and character. To build such a society and such a nation, we must strongly promote Asian values which are deeply rooted in our soil. We must ensure that such values will continue to flourish. This is our choice, and this is the right choice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at Twelve minutes to Three o'clock pm and the Debate having continued for half an hour, Mr Deputy Speaker adjourned the House without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at Eighteen\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   minutes past Three o'clock pm\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   to a date to be fixed.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION SYSTEM</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Decision on Revision)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

Any increase in intake can only be done after a careful study of these factors including the employment market for graduates. \n  <br>\n  <br>(c) The University's enrolment is still expanding and the targeted staff/student ratio has not as yet been reached in several faculties. As part-time courses will impose a heavy demand on staff members and require additional facilities, this can only be considered by the University when its enrolment has been stabilised. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CORRESPONDENCE WITH MR CHIA THYE POH</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> I believe the Member for Anson is referring to the case of Chia Thye Poh who is detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA). Chia was a member of the illegal Communist Party of Malaya (CPM). Chia was specifically instructed by the CPM to penetrate the Barisan Sosialis and engage in Communist United Front agitation to destabilise the Government. This he did by mounting a series of illegal demonstrations and industrial strikes. Chia was therefore placed under preventive detention in November 1966. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Internal Security (Detained Persons) Rules 1960, only close relatives of the detainees, their legal counsel, and members of the Board of Inspection comprising prominent members of the public, are allowed to visit them. There is discretion to allow visits by other relatives or friends. Unfortunately, in the 1960's Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen visited ISA detainees and abused the privileges. They interfered with Government's efforts to rehabilitate them. They had encouraged the detainees to remain steadfast in their stand against the Government, so that their continued detention could be used to embarrass the Government. Since then the privilege of MPs to visit detainees has been withdrawn. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have permitted the Member for Anson to see Chia as his legal counsel. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PROFITS AND LOSSES OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED COMPANIES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. \n  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health if he will give the profits and losses of each of the companies in which the government has an interest for the years 1983 and 1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Details of Government's share of the profits and losses of each of the companies in which it has an interest for the years 1983 and 1984 are enclosed (Annex B).

Following the increase in duty, petrol sales in April, May and June this year averaged 42.8m litres per month. This represents a drop of 8 per cent when compared to the same three months of 1984. Compared to the first three months of this year, it is a 10 per cent drop. The reduction is significant even allowing for the fact that some motorists are buying petrol in Johore Bahru. Therefore the increase in duty has had its intended effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although petrol sales have dropped, revenue by way of petrol tax has increased. Duty from petrol sales in April, May and June this year averaged $38.2 million per month. This is about 33 per cent higher than the amount collected in the corresponding months of 1984 and 21 per cent higher than the amount collected in the first three months of this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that current measures to curb excessive use of cars are achieving the desired effect.
