This arose out of the 1977 promotion exercise. All principals were interviewed by the Public Service Commission. They were assessed for their fitness to be confirmed as principals. Those considered unfit returned to teaching, where replacements were found. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for the Public Service Commission's decision varied from case to case. In addition to assessment at these interviews, staff confidential reports were taken into account. Some principals were found to be lacking in leadership, being too soft on teachers or being unable to motivate them to good performance. Others did not have sufficient professional competence. Others seemed rigid and unwilling to consider different points of view. One was under disciplinary investigation for alleged financial malpractice. Another asked to be demoted. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of primary school principals covered by this exercise was just over 300. The figure of nine does not show that the Public Service Commission has set up unreasonably stringent standards. Quite the contrary, I would have thought. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Sir, why did it take so long a time, almost more than two years from 1977 to 1979, for the Ministry of Education to discover that these primary school principals were not efficient, apart from one or two cases; and have they been given a warning prior to their demotion? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The delay was due to the fact that although the promotion exercise took place in 1977, the formal appointments were not due to be made until 1978. In fact, there was a delay of just under one year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for warnings, no warning was given because this was the first time, I believe, that the post of principal in schools was considered a promotion post. Previously the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> post of principal was not a promotion post, and there had been instances where the principals would be junior to some of the teachers because the teachers did not like to be principals.

The issue of work permits is also not dependent on the size of the companies. Rather, it is based on the qualifications of the applicants. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry recently introduced a Work Permit Scheme for Foreign Workers. This scheme allows manufacturing companies to recruit workers from neighbouring countries on a block basis. Again, the scheme does not make distinction between local or foreign manufacturing companies.

Member for Serangoon Gardens in January 1978, it was explained that there were no proposals to widen Lorong Chuan. The construction of two new roads in the vicinity, namely, the North-South Arterial Road between Thomson Road and Avenue 1, Ang Mo Kio, and the extension of Avenue 1, Ang Mo Kio, from Lorong Chuan to Boundary \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Road would relieve the peak hour traffic congestion along Lorong Chuan. These roads are scheduled for completion by December 1979 and October 1980 respectively. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Sir, in view of what the Minister has just said, would he consider two proposals to alleviate the present problem of traffic congestion along Lorong Chuan: (a) to widen the stretch of road along Lorong Chuan, which has only one lane traffic; and (b) to install a traffic light system at the junction of Lorong Chuan and Serangoon Garden Way. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, to question (a), the answer is yes. The Public Works Department is considering the widening of Lorong Chuan, the stretch of one-lane traffic at the junction of Lorong Chuan and Braddell Road. And to question (b) on the installation of a traffic light at the junction of Lorong Chuan and Serangoon Garden Way, it is not practicable because Serangoon Garden Way is only a two-lane carriageway, that means one lane in either direction. If a traffic light is to be installed there, then Serangoon Garden Way will have to be widened to a four-lane carriageway, that means two lanes in either direction, otherwise the traffic light will not function effectively. Installation of a traffic light will involve the acquisition of properties, sometimes taking away the front gardens of residences for the widening of the road. We consider that to be undesirable. It would be better to wait for the new roads to be completed than taking away the front gardens of residences in that area. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>HOUSING BOARD SHOP PREMISES</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Rent increase on changes in tenancy)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether there is a limit to the increase in rent of Housing and Development Board shophouses when tenants of such premises are involved in the change of ownership of business and names of tenants. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, shopkeepers' requests for change of trades, inclusion or change of partners, are usually \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> approved subject to increase in rentals to prevailing market rates for that area. However, total assignment of the premises will not be allowed. In this case, the registered tenants will have to terminate the tenancy and return the shops to the Housing Board. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, does the Minister not think that the increase in rentals to prevailing market rates or to neighbourhood rates obtainable could do an injustice to the tenants, because no two situations are absolutely identical, because one location may be better than the other? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, I agree with the hon. Member that no two situations are identical. However, the assessment of rentals for shops is usually based on the prevailing rates in the surrounding area. If, for example, in a particular neighbourhood the tender for rentals for a provision shop is $800, then we look at it this way. If the particular shop premises that we are considering raising the rental is less favourably located, then the rental will be less than $800. But if that particular shop is better located, then the rental will be higher than $800. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add that the reason for the reassessment of the rental is this. The Housing Board policy on tendering out shops is to base the rental on the highest tender for that particular trade. It is not the highest tender for the shop. Let us say in the Neighbourhood centre we have a number of shops for rent. We usually try to provide the widest range of services possible so that the residents will have a barber shop to go to for a haircut, a bank to bank in their money, and perhaps a pet shop to purchase their birds. So for a shop to sell four digit lottery, the tenant like the Turf Club usually pays the highest rent. For a bird shop, the tenant pays a low rent because he cannot afford to pay a high rent. So if the HDB rents out a shop to the Turf Club, the Club pays a high rent. And if the HDB rents out a shop to a barber, the rent is low. That is the reason why we cannot allow a barber shop to change its trade to, say, a bank or a finance company because that would mean a great difference in the rental. If it wants t \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> change its trade to a bank, then it will have to pay a higher rental. That is the reason why, when a shopowner requests a change of trade, an upward adjustment of the rental is involved. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Housing Board premises are not rent-controlled premises, we do not adjust the rental upwards if the market rental has been increased in that area. But if a shopkeeper wants to assign the shop to other people and thereby collect tea money, it will not be allowed by the Housing Board. That is the reason why we find that the shopkeeper usually takes in new partners first and, after a while, transfers the name of the shop to his new partners. This is, in fact, a roundabout way of trying to assign his shop. In such a case the Housing Board will say, \"It is not allowed. If you want to assign the shop to your new partner which you have taken in, then you have to surrender your premises back to the Housing Board.because you will not be allowed to take the tea money.\" \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, based on the Minister's own argument, would he agree that under the circumstances the HDB can overcharge or undercharge the tenant? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, theoretically yes.

In terms of international economic competitiveness, even though the economic growths of Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan were better than that of Singapore, their inflation rates were higher, being 5.7%, 16.4% and 5.7% respectively. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paying tribute to the Government for its success in keeping our rate of inflation below the figure of our economic growth, I am constrained to ask whether the Government is appreciative of the contribution of Labour in keeping this figure so low. I am prompted to ask this question because there are many factors which determine the rate of inflation. The role of labour should not be overlooked or disregarded. I am therefore astonished to find that the Minister's statement did not include a positive reference to the contribution made by the trade unions and workers of Singapore towards assisting the Government to maintain high economic growth, with a low inflation rate. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often bemoaned that the young workers of today take full employment and affluence for granted, as their birth right; but it seems to me that the Government is similarly guilty of such an attitude. Those of us who were in the Labour movement in the 1950s know the difficulties that confronted workers in those days. The contribution of workers to Singapore's development and economy should not be forgotten. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, in the 50's the workers sacrificed their personal freedom and employment in \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> their struggle for independence, arm-in-arm with the nationalists who were seeking independence for Singapore. In the early 60's, the workers, grouped under the banner of the NTUC, helped the Government to defeat the communists in the trade union movement and ousted the stooges in the trade union movement who, acting on instructions of their principals in other countries, sought to disrupt Singapore's economy and overthrow the Government by violence. In the 70's organised labour began to play an important role as partners in economic development by ensuring social, economic and political stability so that our economy could grow and yet keeping it internationally competitive. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will recall that in 1968 when Singapore faced serious economic problems as a consequence of British withdrawal, the Government introduced the restrictive Employment Act which would in ordinary circumstances have created an uproar in any democratic country. But the workers of Singapore, having considered the circumstances and the grave problems facing our Republic, subordinated their own interests to the overall national interest by accepting many restrictions and impediments for the common good. And it cannot be denied that their responsible attitude has been a major contribution to the investment climate and Singapore's economic growth. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having decided to be partners in economic development, the trade unions have resolved their problems by consultation and by exercising great restraint. They have joined in productivity schemes, they have worked hard, and have thus in no small way contributed to our economic growth of 8.6%; they have also contributed in keeping inflation down to 4.8%. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one has only got to look around to see what chaos trade unions can bring about if they choose to be trenchant, truculent, irresponsible and self-centred. One has only to look at the newspapers every day to see how national economies can be upset and disorganised by trade unions who do not concern themselves with their countries' \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> state of development and economic progress. Britain, from whence came our basic trade union concepts, was, for example, thrown into utter confusion by a series of strikes which paralysed the country. This pattern of trade union manipulation and irresponsibility has manifested itself in several countries. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am therefore extremely surprised that the Government has not deemed it necessary to publicly acknowledge the role of our National Trades Union Congress by giving it more tangible recognition in the form of some financial support to the Labour Foundation. When the Labour Foundation Bill was introduced, I was aghast at the statement in the explanatory note in the Bill saying that \"the establishment of this Foundation would not involve the Government in any financial commitment\". I would have thought that, in recognising the role played by organised labour through the National Trades Union Congress, the Government would be more than happy to make a substantial contribution year by year to show its appreciation of the contribution made by the trade union movement to Singapore's economic growth and lower inflation rate. But what do we observe from the present budget? To quote the words of Mr Harold Wilson, all we hear is \"a deafening silence\" as regards the role played by labour in support of Singapore's economic and social growth. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no rational person can deny that for the workers of Singapore, grouped under the banner of the Singapore National Trades Union Congress, the over-riding factor in industrial matters is our national interest. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our trade unions and their leaders have made sacrifices and contributions to Singapore's development and it should be apparent to all that Singapore, without our National Trades Union Congress, would be like Rome without the Vatican. Without an organisation like the NTUC and the dedicated persons at the helm, Singapore's economy may well fall apart. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I suggest that Government acknowledges the role of the trade union movement of Singapore and demonstrates this acknowledgement in a tangible way by making a substantial annual grant to the Singapore Labour Foundation which has been set up at the request of the NTUC for the benefit of workers, both unionised and non-unionised. \n  <br>3.00 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Koh Lip Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Koh Lip Lin (Nee Soon)</b>( \n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to congratulate the Senior Minister of State for Finance for presenting what has been unanimously accepted as a painless budget. Although the various tax concessions will not benefit every one, all are happy because there are no new tax measures. Last year, we maintained a fairly satisfactory rate of economic growth, together with a low unemployment rate and a small rise in the cost of living index. All these proved our success in 1978 which we hope to repeat this year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1979 world economic preview is not good. The increased price of oil will cause a rise in the prices of other materials. In addition, the instability in the international scene and the gradual spread of protectionism will prove to be a detriment to our nation's development. However, I believe that in the coming year, local and foreign investments in our country will gradually increase and Singapore will not only develop into a service centre in this area but will also become one of the safest countries to invest in. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget statement, I am glad to learn that the Government will encourage industrial research and development (R and D). At present, most of our important industries depend on imported expertise and technical know-how. It is time we promoted and carried out our own industrial research and development, without which our industries will not last nor be able to compete with that of other countries. It is a wise decision to extend to new manufacturing companies the provision to deduct \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> expenditure incurred on R and D for income tax purposes. Undoubtedly, this will help to attract more investments. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to note that the Ministry of Finance is carrying out a long-term research and development project in conjunction with other departments concerned, such as the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Science Council and SISIR, to promote research and development and to train the personnel required. I hope the staff in our tertiary institutions will be given a chance to participate when this project is implemented. Please do not overlook the manpower resource and potentialities of these people. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we should not emphasise on the fundamental researches which only the Great Powers can afford. However, mastering and transmitting of fundamental knowledge in science and technology constitute the basis on which training of personnel in research and development is based. Therefore, our Government should give its fullest support to the future development of our science and technological faculties of our tertiary institutions. From the Budget, we can see that the sum allotted for R and D for the departments mentioned above is far too small. But I hope this is only the beginning, and the Government will in future give greater assistance to industrial research and development. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our nation is at present marching towards industrialisation which has brought us, as everybody knows, economic benefit and employment opportunities. However, it has also brought about some undesirable consequences, one of which is pollution. Pollution is inevitable in industrial development. We cannot escape from it. We can only minimise it. The Ministry of the Environment has introduced certain laws and regulations against pollution. Its officials visit the factories regularly to ensure that the regulations are being followed. The Anti-Pollution Unit does check on the extent of pollution in the various districts. However, pollution caused by industrial activities is not easy to control. Sometimes pollution caused \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> by industries, intentionally or unintentionally, was discovered to be very serious only when it was too late to remedy. This has happened in Japan, the United States and the West European countries. Singapore is a small island. We cannot permit any serious pollution. Recently, a certain pond in Changi was discovered to contain cyanide; and radioactive material was found in a steel mill. Fortunately, no serious damage was caused, but it suffices as a warning to us. The disposal of industrial effluent water and waste gases generally costs money. In order to economise, some manufacturers have found it expedient to let their factories emit large amounts of black smoke or odorous gases during the night or weekends when the officials from the Ministry of the Environment are not around. To the people in Jurong Town, this has become a common occurrence. I hope the Government department concerned would be more stringent in enforcing the law against industrial pollution. However, assistance should be given to the small-scale industries, particularly the indigenous industries, when the department tackles the problem of industrial pollution. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to touch on some problems on education. Right now, bilingualism is one problem that is attracting the greatest concern from the people in Singapore. Over the last few years bilingual education has been vigorously implemented in our schools, but the result has been far from ideal. Hence, the Ministry of Education has made quite a number of adjustments in its education policy and its measures which are aimed at improving the quality of education in our schools. But members of the public are usually not aware of the background to and the objectives of these changes and they are therefore most dissatisfied with the so-called sudden and hasty changes introduced by the Ministry. Both parents and pupils are often bewildered by such sudden changes. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Singaporeans, next to making money, what preoccupies them most is their children's education and their future. Any policy or measure that prejudices their \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> children's chance of getting into a good school, or getting a good grade in the examination, or getting into a university, is bound to spring a grouse. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second language teaching in Singapore has not been very successful. Although we have produced students who have mastered two languages, they are in the minority. The general run of students is deficient in second language. Even undergraduates, who are within the best 5% of our student population in terms of intelligence or scholastic performance, are barely proficient in their first language and sadly deficient in their second language. It is inconceivable that these top 5%, having studied the second language continuously for 12 years, several hours a week, could attain only a low standard. The only conclusion we can arrive at is that something must have gone wrong somewhere in our education process. I do not intend to speculate as to where the flaw lies, whether it be the students, parents, teachers or the Ministry of Education. Nevertheless, the flaw exists and nobody can deny this. It is hoped that the Ministry will as soon as possible try to identify the root cause of the flaw and apply the necessary measures to rectify it. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we do not deny the importance of learning and mastering two languages, we should not over-emphasise the acquisition of languages for that is not the main object of education. The main object of education is to bring up young people to become useful citizens. What we need are people with the necessary training and knowledge to maintain the prosperity and progress that we have achieved, a people imbued with a sense of national consciousness, high moral values and a fine cultural tradition. The cultivation of such qualities is more important than the studying of languages. It is hoped that, while reviewing the school curriculum and teaching methods, the Ministry will not lose sight of this objective. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a very apt saying in Chinese which goes: \"it takes ten years to \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> grow a tree, but it takes a hundred years to nurture a man.\" Education is a matter of vital and lasting importance in nation building. How we educate our next generation will decide whether we prosper or perish in future. The effects of any changes in education policy and system made today will not be seen in the next two or three years. Any improvement can only be felt in the next five or ten years. Similarly, the effects of any wrong measures can be detected only after a period of time. Hence, any important education reform should be carried out only after we have given it a very careful thought. Any hasty decision should be eschewed. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's provision for education, there is an increase of 25% in development expenditure for primary and secondary schools and junior colleges. This is a heartening sign. At the same time, there is a decrease in the number of teaching staff but an increase in the number of administrative staff. This indicates that in the coming year emphasis will be on development and strengthening of educational administration. It is hoped that under the new policy and administration, our education system will become more perfect. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to support the Budget and the Budget Statement. \n  <br>3.11 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before proceeding to deliver my speech, I think it is pertinent to mention that I have prepared my text before the televised discussion on the Budget on 12th March, in which the Senior Minister of State for Finance took part. it seems to me that in future this House will have to debate not only the Budget speech delivered in the House but also a supplementary one delivered outside the House. The televised discussion, which took place before Members could have an opportunity to debate on the Budget speech, gives the impression that the Senior Minister of State is perhaps more interested in the reactions from a handful of selected individuals than from the elected \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> representatives of the people. I am sure this is not the case and maybe the Hon. Senior Minister of State would, in his reply later on wish to give the rationale behind his action. I will now proceed to deliver my speech. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to the majority of our working population the so-called painless Budget is neither pleasurable nor surprising. From past experience they know only too well that there is no absolute guarantee that in the course of the next few months some items of Government taxes, fees and charges may not go up. In the light of recent oil price increases and events in Iran, I do not think we can rule out completely the possibility of a hike in PUB charges. There are already indications that the self-imposed price restraint exercised by OPEC countries for the past few years might soon come to an end. This has led some observers to predict that now, as in 1973-74, the danger is, that rocketing oil prices will aggravate inflation, force governments around the world to fight back by clamping down on domestic growth and for the second time in a decade plunge the world economy into a slide. In his speech, the Hon. Senior Minister of State did express concern in this direction and his call for economising the use of oil and electricity should be taken most seriously. It is a pity that the euphoria generated by the so-called painless Budget has almost completely over-shadowed the real threat looming ahead. In view of the fact that the uncertainty over the price and the supply of oil is likely to become a permanent feature, I do like to know whether the Government has formulated a long-term energy policy with a view to reducing our dependence on oil. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to the average man-in-the-street the various concessions are quite meaningless. It is highly unlikely that many of our working population will ever reach the sort of income levels as to benefit by the increase from $4,000 to $5,000 in allowable tax deduction in respect of CPF contributions and other approved schemes. A more meaningful exercise from their point of view would be to raise the personal relief and earned income deduction from its present level of $3,000. Relatively few people are staying in houses in \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> excess of $100,000 in value as to benefit by the revision in estate duty. Fewer still will benefit by the increased capital allowance for company-owned cars. All in all, the concessions can best be described as \"bourgeoisie\" in character, appealing to the minority of middle and upper-middle classes in our society. Be that as it may, it is equitable that the contributions of people in this category should not go unrecognised as they have for many years borne the brunt of the tax burden. One disappointment is that, except for the pensioners who are now granted the long overdue tax exemption which they rightly deserve, nothing has been proposed for the less fortunate amongst us. In saying so, I have in mind the financially distressed, the aged, the chronically sick, the widows and orphans who depend on public assistance for their livelihood. With all the apparent signs of an affluent society around us, it is only too easy to forget that there are still poverty-stricken people who need help. The fact that the have-nots constitute only a very small number among us is no consolation to them. If anything, by contrast their miseries are magnified and seem more acute. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Social Welfare Department's report for the year 1977, there is still an average of well over 6,000 cases per month of people depending on public assistance. The existing rates of allowances are appallingly low. The scale is as follows: \n  <pre>\r\n   Maximum per\r\n     household              $100 per month\r\n   For head of household    $ 40 per month\r\n   For the wife             $ 26 per month\r\n   For each dependant       $ 17 per month\r\n</pre> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can you imagine a family of, say, three persons - a widowed mother with two school-going children - trying to make ends meet with a meagre sum of $74 per month? The means test applied by the Department is also extremely stringent. The recipient is not permitted to look for even a lowly paid part-time job to supplement the limited assistance extended. I do not know when the scale of allowances and the conditions of our public assistance scheme were last revised, but I \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> strongly feel that the time has come for us to adopt a much more sympathetic approach. Whilst I agree that we ought to guard against abuse, I also believe that we should not lose our sense of compassion for those genuine hardship cases badly in need of assistance. The total sum expended by Government for the year 1978 amounted to $3.6 million and I see that the same amount is being budgeted for 1979. Surely we can afford to increase this amount to take into account the effect of inflation and the generally higher standard of living without unduly straining our financial resources. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the various measures proposed to sustain or stimulate growth in the various sectors, I would now like to offer my observations. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <i>(1) Industrial Development</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that the Ministry is drawing up plans to embark on research and development, albeit on a limited scale. From a long-term point of view, it will be useful to our industrial development if we could actively nurture a spirit of inventiveness among our people. Over the years. there have been a few isolated cases of local inventions reported. In one particular case involving a constituent of mine, I do know that he had had to go through untold frustrations and difficulties in order to get an invention of his evaluated for commercial viability. Perhaps the Government should consider giving encouragement and assistance to individuals with original ideas. We should not under-estimate the ingenuity of our own local talents. The marketability of the gold-plated orchids of SISIR has amply demonstrated the potentials and benefits of product related type of research. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the somewhat lukewarm response to the Product Development Assistance Scheme could well be the result of inadequate study of the needs coupled with inflexibility on the part of those responsible for the processing of applications. At the last Budget, this House was kept informed of the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> financial assistance scheme to small industries. This year there is a total silence on the subject. Has that scheme turned out to be a flop? Perhaps the Hon. Senior Minister of State would like to enlighten the House. Over the years there have been numerous incentive schemes introduced for the manufacturing sector. I am just wondering how thorough the problems and the needs are researched into prior to the implementation of a scheme, and how closely the effectiveness of each of such schemes is monitored. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has time and again reiterated its support for local industries but to date development in this direction has remained slow. Whilst the Government is not entirely to blame. I do feel that the EDB should be directed, preferably in conjunction with the relevant bodies in the private sector, to carry out a comprehensive survey to identify the problem areas and to propose measures that will encourage greater local participation in industrial development. It is ironical that although we have been extremely successful in attracting foreign investments in this direction, we seem to have failed miserably in getting our own entrepreneurs to commit their capitals to industries. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <i>(2) Trade Development</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to register my disappointment over the long delay in the formation of a Trade Development Council. Members will recall the idea was first mooted during the Budget Debate some two years ago. Reading between the lines, I gain the impression that the Government is only prepared to play a supporting role. Given the rather dim outlook of world trade for 1979, I would have thought that the Government would stop dragging its feet and, as a matter of urgency, take over the initiative in the formation and day-to-day running of the proposed Council. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <i>(3) Services Development</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of tourist promotion, I think it will be to our advantage and indeed to the advantages of other member countries that \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> we should increasingly think and act in terms of ASEAN. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sufficient attractions in all the five ASEAN countries. What is required is closer cooperation in the promotion. I have read the Annual Report of the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board for the year 1977/78 but I can find no evidence of efforts being made to bring about closer cooperation with our ASEAN partners. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reduced taxation of 20% as an incentive to encourage the export of our professional and technical expertise seems to aim primarily at the construction industries. However, I have my doubts as to whether the preferential margin for local contractors of up to 5% with regard to government tenders for building projects will be sufficient to enable our own contractors to successfully compete against foreign contractors, particularly those from Japan, who have allegedly been \"dumping\" their services locally for the past several years. Far from being encouraging, some of our departments I gather are notoriously slow in making progress payments to our own contractors for jobs done. This has placed a great number of contractors in financial difficulties. To assist our local contractors to establish a reputation at home that will help penetrate into overseas markets, in-depth study needs to be conducted into their problems, particularly the organisation and capital structures and the standard of management of local construction firms. In our anxiousness to encourage the export of local expertise, it is important to bear in mind that conditions prevailing in other countries are bound to be different from our own and in some cases the differences can be so vast as to render our local expertise inadequate or totally irrelevant. There have been stories of local businessmen losing their pants in West Asian markets owing to ignorance of local conditions. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, be it the export of service or commodity, market research is vital and it is in this area that extensive assistance should be extended by the Government to the private sector. There is need to upgrade the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> standard of commercial secretaries attached to our various overseas missions and to open up more trade representative offices. There should be better coordination among our various Government and quasi-Government bodies represented abroad in the collation and dissemination of commercial and industrial intelligence for the use of our own businessmen. It goes without saying that the ultimate success or failure will depend on the determination of our own businessmen to help themselves. In this regard they should be happy to note that, \"to encourage more aggressive marketing overseas, the double tax deduction scheme will now also apply to expenses incurred in advertising and promotional campaigns overseas, the production of sales literature and brochures, and the undertaking of market surveys.\" Let us hope that full advantage will be taken of the incentive offered and in the process greater sophistication will be introduced in all promotional exercises abroad. \n  <br>3.28 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr C.V. Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr C.V. Devan Nair (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have some reservations on the Budget statement delivered by the Hon. Senior Minister of State for Finance. But, first, let me congratulate the Senior Minister of State on his presentation. He delivered the Budget address in terms that the public had come to expect from the Government - realistic, sober and hard-headedly cautious. His performance augurs well for the future. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first observation relates not so much to the Budget address itself but to the public reactions to the statement. The press headlined it favourably as \"a painless budget\", \"a mildly pleasurable budget\", and so on. But the sombre undertones of the Senior Minister of State's address were not sufficiently underscored. I wish it had been otherwise, so that the public would not have been left with a mildly euphoric feeling, to the effect that \"God is in His Heaven, and all is right with the world, including Singapore.\" Regrettably, God may be in His Heaven, but all is certainly not right with the world. The Minister bluntly told this House and I quote, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \"I am not optimistic about the outlook for world economic growth in 1979.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he gave his reasons, which included an expected slow-down in the world economy, the proposed four-stage oil price increase totalling 14.5% in 1979 by OPEC, and the more sombre prospect of a world oil shortage following disruption of supply from Iran. So there is nothing to crow about in the fact that in 1978, 41,000 jobs were created, and unemployment fell to a record low of 3.6%. If things go dangerously wrong, in South East Asia, in Iran, and the Middle East, or elsewhere, it could be the other way round, and unemployment could hit a record high in the coming years, rather than a record low. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A morbid obsession by the doomsday syndrome does not help, and I certainly do not recommend it. But neither must we fail to remember that international political and economic forces and factors, over which we have no control, continuously impinge on our lives, for better or for worse. Singapore may be likened to a ship sailing through very stormy international waters, boosted or buffeted by every passing wind. And sometimes these winds blow violently. The only guarantees we have are that the captain and the crow of the Singapore ship are quietly efficient and do not panic, and that the ship itself is seaworthy. And to keep the Singapore ship seaworthy, it is of vital importance to preserve that national cohesion, sense of purpose and direction, and social and political stability, which continue to attract investments and technology to our shores. The capacity we have shown in the past for making rapid adjustments to challenge and change will call for constant renewal. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot expect the shallow-brained smart Alecs, who take things for granted, and seem to believe that this small island-state of ours occupies the centre of the universe, to see this. Fortunately, the majority of Singaporeans possess that indispensable political sixth-sense, which perceives the possible dangers and pitfalls ahead, and \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> which largely explains the results of the general elections in December 1976, and of the recent by-elections. I am not sorry for those who lost. The simple truth is that they deserved to lose. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only observe that any Singaporean who looks around at the Sino-Vietnamese-Soviet imbroglio in Indochina, at the developments in Iran, the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, Afghanistan, and at growing protectionism in the developed countries, and yet continues to believe that Singapore is situated right in the middle of Paradise, should have his head examined, free of charge, at Woodbridge. The Budget does not provide for this. I recommend that it does. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for my reservations on the Budget. If there was one part of the Budget address in which the Minister gave the impression that he spoke, with tongue in cheek, as it were, it was when he announced the concession to pensioners. As I listened I did not think so. But later, I was told that this was so. And it is important that the Government should take heed of what the average man-in-the-street thinks. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One junior civil servant told me, \"Look, this is a concession formulated by superscale civil servants for their own kind, who have retired.\" When asked why he thought so, he replied, \"The exemption from income tax favours only those who receive pensions in the chargeable brackets. A large proportion of pensioners do not receive chargeable pensions. Take the retired postman, fireman, customs employee, and so on. They receive pensions of less than $400 per month. But nobody remembers them. And they get nothing from the so-called concession. These superscale follows sure know how to look after their own kind\". Sir, these were the words, not my words, but the words I am quoting. I know our superscale civil servants, and I know that, by and large, they are beyond reproach. But this was the impression created in the mind of an honest man. Also implied in his remarks is the notion that our Cabinet Ministers are people who can be easily led by the nose by superscale civil servants, which again I know to be wrong. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of a recently retired junior public servant was the same. He told \"i will get a pension of only $300 per month, and I have a wife and three children to look after. What is there in this concession for me? The Minister says he is not hard-hearted. But he is only soft-hearted to those better off than I am.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the occupational responsibility of a trade union leader to keep his ears as closely as possible to the ground. These were the reactions I encountered. And they were honest reactions. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe that the Government has soft feelings only for the better-off pensioners, and not for the run-of-the-mill pensioners, who constitute the majority. It is a pity, therefore, that the Minister failed to state in his address what the Government had in mind for the pensioners who do not enjoy chargeable pensions. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition of past services rendered to the nation (and these were the Senior Minister of State for Finance's own words) by pensioners, and the ravages of inflation, should not apply only to those with chargeable pensions, but also to the majority of pensioners who do not receive chargeable pensions. Even-handedness in the dispensation of social justice is a sine qua non for a government which values its credibility. I hope that the Minister will rectify this omission in the course of his reply to the debate. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, some necessarily trenchant words on protectionism. The Minister had the governments of the developed countries in mind. The real culprits, however, seem to be the trade unions in the developed countries, and some international trade union organisations which they control. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With every passing day, I feel obliged to pose a bigger question mark against their professions of international labour solidarity Indeed, it sometimes seems to me that one of the biggest on-going humbuggeries in the modern world is this froth about \"international labour solidarity\". \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, a Singapore-registered ship is being held up in the port of Elat in Israel, despite the fact that the crew are covered by a collective agreement certified by our Industrial Arbitration Court. This ship is being held up at the behest of the International Transportworkers' Federation (ITF) with headquarters in London. The company which owns the ship is a German company registered in Singapore. They have a total of some 21 Singapore-registered ships, and they employ 700 Singapore crew and officers. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the ITF is blatantly protectionist. They intend to force every ship registered in developing countries, and employing crew recruited in these developing countries, to pay ITF rates of pay, which are West European rates of pay. The result, of course, is that seamen from the developing countries are priced out of their jobs. To date, thousands of seamen from countries like India, Pakistan, Philippines and Taiwan have been rendered jobless - thanks to such manifestations of \"international labour solidarity\". \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five of our trade unions in Singapore are affiliated to the ITF. I send two emissaries from the NTUC to London last week, to try and persuade the ITF, in the name of international labour solidarity, to drop their action against the Singapore-registered ship. My emissaries were rebuffed. They were bluntly told that this is only the beginning of ITF action against Singapore-registered ships. I must now inform the House that the German company concerned has been forced by the ITF to buckle in. They will now be obliged to deregister their 21 ships from Singapore, dismiss their Singapore-recruited crews and officers, and probably re-register in Germany. They will thereafter employ West European crew at West European rates of pay. This means that 700 locally-recruited seamen and officers will lose their jobs in the very near future. And 700 Singapore families will lose their means of livelihood. And as the ITF action against Singapore-registered ships gathers momentum, a few thousand Singapore seamen and officers will find themselves without jobs. So much for \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> international labour solidarity, as practised by the ITF. A more damning indictment of international labour hypocrisy can hardly be imagined. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of years ago, an Australian trade union refused to release a Singapore-registered ship unless the shipowners agreed to pay ITF rates of pay. Their bluff was easily called. I told the Australian trade union concerned that I would have no objection to our seamen being given Australian rates of pay, on condition that they were also offered Australian citizenship. This, of course, was unthinkable to my comrades in Australia. What happened was that the shipowner was finally forced to cough up, returned to Singapore, and promptly dismissed his locally-recruited crew. It is not concern for Singapore seamen which motivated the Australian trade union. That was only a smoke-screen behind which they effectively priced our seamen out of their jobs. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, then, are the new imperialists. And it is an ironic twist of history that the new imperialists should be - not capitalists - but some trade unions in the developed countries. They are trying to achieve today, what the colonial powers tried to achieve in the past, through the infamous Navigation Acts, i.e. the monopoly of carrying cargo in their own ships, manned by their own crews to the detriment of merchant shipping in the developing countries. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little that trade unions in the developing countries in Asia can do against ITF protectionism. We have no leverage whatsoever to exert against them. The only thing we can do is to withdraw our affiliation to the ITF. After all, why pay affiliation fees to an organisation whose policies result in loss of jobs for our workers. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protectionist character of the ITF is again exemplified by their attitude to the Australian International Civil Aviation Policy (ICAP). The aim of this Australian-British duopoly is to squeeze out the airlines of the developing countries which lie between Australia and Britain. If they succeed, apart \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> from serious loss of tourist traffic, our airline workers also stand to lose their jobs. In fact, I have already told our airline workers that however much the Singapore girl may smile, Singapore Airlines may not fly. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this suits the ITF fine! They therefore keep mum about the Australian-ASEAN dispute over ICAP. Australian trade union leaders were conspicuous by their absence during the recent Asian Labour Summit held in Singapore, although they are members of the Asian Regional Organisation of the ICFTU. I know why they did not show up. Because they knew very well that Asian trade union leaders would have given them a tongue-lashing over the Australian ICAP. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are clearly people who have no sympathies whatsoever for our jobs, but they rush to arms over the question of trade union rights in developing countries. And this pretension of the ITF needs to be debunked for what it is - the most brazen and shameless cant and hypocrisy. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we can ask: how is it that neither the ITF nor Australian trade unions nor West European trade unions make any noise or pass fierce resolutions when workers in developing countries lose their jobs by the thousands, as a result of policies like those pursued by the ITF? One would have thought that one of the most important trade union rights is the right to ensure, as far as is humanly possible, that workers keep their jobs. But this is precisely the right which is systematically and callously violated by protectionist trade union organisations like the ITF. And yet, these are precisely the same people who condemn violations of trade union rights in the developing countries, whether imaginary or real. Which is why I call them brazen humbugs. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITF and Australian trade union concern for trade union rights in developing countries does not go with concern for the right of workers in these countries to keep their jobs. And of what use are trade union rights without the far more fundamental right to jobs? But there is a total absence of such concern on the part of the ITF, whether for Asian seamen or for air transport workers. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is why, Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall advise our own Singapore Air Transport-workers' Union, and all other Singapore trade unions affiliated to the ITF, at the appropriate time, to call on the ITF to show cause why our unions should not disaffiliate from that body. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I repeat that the governments of the developing countries will sooner or later be compelled to develop common and effective counter-measures against the ITF brand of protectionism, if our sea and air transport workers are to keep their jobs. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much obliged, Mr Speaker, Sir. \n  <br>3.50 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget came as a pleasant surprise to most of us. For the past few years we had budgets which were described as \"painless\" and \"no-shock\". This year, rumours were rife that the Government would impose additional taxes as part of the economic planning and to cover the ever-increasing expenditure. However, the additional taxes did not come about, and instead we were given a few tax concessions. The budget presented by the Senior Minister of State for Finance was described not only as \"painless\" but also \"mildly pleasurable\". \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1978, in spite of numerous economic problems confronting us, we had forecasted an economic growth rate of 6-8%. This was an optimistic forecast and to achieve it was not an easy task. However, we did better than what we expected. We managed an incredible growth rate of 8.6%. Of course, our growth rate is moderate when compared to that of Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea which managed 10-13% last year. Nevertheless, our economic growth can be considered a rare achievement in view of the numerous obstacles we had to overcome. Our 8.6% growth rate was achieved in spite of the slow-down of the economies of industrialised countries like the United States, Japan and the EEC countries. Other problems which we encountered include the rising oil price and protectionist policies of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> developed countries. The credit of our achievement should go to the Government for her good leadership, the manufacturers for their foresight, the trade unions for their cooperation with employers for their mutual benefit, and the workers who continued to strive hard. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have built up a sound economic and financial base, we should not take for granted that our continued progress is assured. Our present economic strength is achieved through years of hard work and sacrifices. Our future progress depends on how we tackle the economic and political problems as we plod along our way to economic prosperity. If we become complacent now, we would be swamped with economic problems and all our past achievements would go down the drain. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic prospects in 1979 are uncertain. Among the problems which will continue to plague our economic growth are slow growth in the economies of industrialised countries, hike in oil price, and protectionist policies of developed countries. The OPEC countries had announced a 14.5% increase in oil price this year. The economies of developed countries will be affected by this oil-price hike. As we are heavily dependent on the economies of developed countries, our economy will also be affected. Besides, with the hike in oil price, our oil bill will also be inflated and this will have an adverse effect on our economy. Another serious problem which we have to bear in mind is the intensifying of protectionist policies by developed countries. Formerly, these policies were restricted to trade. Now, they have been extended to the air by Australia. The end-to-end civil aviation policy initiated by Australia has been received favourably by some other developed countries, and there are signs that other developed countries will try out the new policy. If they do, all developing countries, including Singapore will be adversely affected. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem we have to face is the unsettled conditions in Indochina. No one can predict what the communists will do when they have consolidated their position in \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the whole of Indochina. This uncertainty will deter capitalists from investing in Southeast Asia and thus slow down the economic growth of this region. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure continued progress for our country, we must prepare ourselves to face these problems. The Government must continue to seek ways and means of encouraging the inflow of capital from advanced countries. The employers, trade unions and workers must continue to work hand-in-hand for their mutual interest. We must also bear in mind that some of the problems we face could only be tackled successfully when the ASEAN countries are united as a single block of nations. Thus we should work towards closer cooperation among ASEAN countries. To partly alleviate the effects of increasing oil price, we should also try our best to cut down our demand for energy. Both industries and households should play their part in preventing wastage of energy. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year the Government has decided to introduce more concessions for manufacturers who invest on advertising and promotional campaigns overseas. Tax incentives are also introduced for new manufacturers who invest in research and development of their products. These measures will, to a certain extent, have a favourable effect on the current account of our balance of payment. The deficit in the current account had deteriorated in 1978. Fortunately, we did not face any balance of payment problem because of the heavy inflow of capital from overseas. This situation should not be allowed to go on forever. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore taken a step in the right direction in encouraging more aggressive marketing overseas. However, the concessions given are expected only to have a mild effect on our economy. We hope the Government will continue to review the situation and take further steps to keep our economy sound and healthy. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the tax concessions, I should say that they will generally benefit only a certain percentage of the population. These tax concessions appeared to have been carefully selected to benefit certain sections of the population. The Government's policy is to reward effort, talent and skills at all levels so as to avoid disincentive to work hard. The tax concessions are geared towards achieving this objective. However, a closer look shows that only people in the higher income bracket will benefit from the tax concessions. Does this mean that the lower income group is at present adequately rewarded for their effort, or has the Government forgotten that they should also be rewarded or else their incentive to work harder will also diminish? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Senior Minister of State for Finance has qualified the Budget as \"even mildly pleasurable\". At this juncture, perhaps our economy can absorb only a small concession in tax because of the uncertainties facing us in the years ahead. The tax concessions given this year are presumed to be the most crucial ones and the Government has granted them so as to provide a greater stimulant to our economy. However, we should not forget that the majority of our work force are in the lower income group and they have also played their part in building up our economy. Therefore, they should not be forgotten when more tax concessions are considered in the future. The personal income relief, in particular, has to be reviewed because it has remained unchanged for a long time. Due to inflation in past years, this relief has now become unrealistic and workers in the lower income bracket ire the ones who are affected most. In the past, personal income relief was not reviewed because the Government's aim was to widen the tax base. However, the Government should look into this again, and if an increase in the personal income relief will have only a minor effect on the tax base, it should be raised without delay. As we all know, the income tax issue has been a controversial one over the past years in this House. Year after year most of us, as Backbenchers, have voiced for increased \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> relief for taxpayers. But this has not come about to benefit the ordinary man-in-the-street. We hope that the Hon. Senior Minister of State will take this into serious consideration in the future Budget. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the whole, the Budget is a reasonable one, considering the uncertainties we have to face in the years ahead. It is better than what the majority of the people Have expected. Of course, we would like to have more tax concessions so that more people could benefit from them since we all have done well in the previous year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to join hon. Members of this House in congratulating the Senior Minister of State for Finance for presenting this Budget. \n  <br>4.04 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Motion standing in the name of the Senior Minister of State for Finance. For Singapore's economy to grow by 8.6% in the face of what the Hon. Senior Minister of State calls a \"lackadaisical world economic performance in 1978\" is indeed soul-stirring. What is even more impressive is that growth was achieved amidst relative price stability. This remarkable achievement of our country will continue to reflect to the whole world our unique and successful system of tripartism. Whilst others may have tried and have failed, we have been successful. That is something we ought to be proud of. We must therefore continue to pledge to work even harder and improve upon ourselves, for this is the hallmark of progress. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Senior Minister of State has so adroitly informed the House of his plans to maintain a healthy economic growth for the next financial year, that there is not much one can disagree with except to raise a point of caution here and there to help the process along. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Senior Minister of State has raised the question of indigenous research and development as further fuel to add to our \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> industrialisation drive. This is a welcome idea and a very vital one too; vital because if we examine the structure of the manufacturing sector, we will find that after deducting the involvement of the multi-national companies we are left with an indigenous manufacturing sector that concentrates mainly on food products, plastics and textiles. In other words, we have no manufacturing base and also no technological base in the private sector. While it is true that organised research is being carried out in the Ministry of Defence and in organisations like SISIR, there is a need for greater efforts at national level where the Government, with all its machinery, coordinates and directs activities to create a technological base for Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For indigenous research and development to be meaningful and positive, the incentive and the encouragement together with the recognition accorded to those participating must be sufficiently attractive to get the idea off the ground. Admittedly, the Government has evolved many schemes aimed at encouraging research and development or product development among the manufacturing sector. I am concerned not with the rationale behind the schemes but more with their implementation. As an example, I would like to ask the Hon. Senior Minister of State how many companies have benefited from the Product Development Assistance Scheme which was established some two years ago. I know that local manufacturers have applied but, from what I gather from our manufacturers, the Scheme does not appear to meet with favourable response. Maybe the administrators of the Scheme are expecting too much; maybe the guidelines drawn up do not permit flexibility. Whatever the reasons, if the Scheme should prove to be a non-starter, we must then seriously examine further so that it could be revised accordingly. I believe that our highly efficient Civil Service, which is used to a system of justifying costs and getting quick returns for investment, may find it difficult to implement schemes where returns are intangible and hard to quantify. Science and technology, and for that matter research and development, should involve every Ministry \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> and every department in Singapore. A national science and technology policy must therefore involve more than just one Ministry, and I would urge the Government to consider the establishment of a high-powered committee at national level to formulate an appropriate blue print for technology development in Singapore. A long-term plan with hardly any returns, except the promise that Singapore will develop indigenous research and technology, will be difficult to accept. Do we have a choice? The experiences of the developed countries tell us that we do not have any choice. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Senior Minister of State has also announced that, and I quote: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To further assist product development, we will be prepared to extend to new manufacturing companies the existing provision which currently permits only existing companies to deduct expenditure incurred on research and development for income tax purposes.' \n  <br> \n  <br>I wonder how many manufacturers are really finding this scheme financially attractive. Sir, the Hon. Senior Minister of State might turn around later and rebut that at least it is a start to the whole process. But is this enough? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind the Hon. Senior Minister of State's future investment promotion and the various industries that are already in Singapore, do we really know which areas of the industry really require research and development? I suggest we concentrate on directing our efforts on product designs, inclusive of its functionality. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in order to achieve a successful research and development programme, we must carry out a thorough and reliable study (not of the type of manpower survey carried out by the Ministry of Science and Technology) on how and where we should concentrate our research and development efforts and how to extract maximum output from this exercise. I call this process 'intelligence' very nearly similar in meaning to the word used in the Ministry of Defence - to be more exact, the Army. Indeed, Sir, as we journey into the future the outlook of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> which is sombre as the Hon. Senior Minister of State so aptly puts it, we will be fighting so many economic wars that it is important to adopt from this day a more practical view of the importance of research and development, and to be a bit more generous in considering the allocation of funds for research and development efforts, just as they have done for the defence budget - a budget that is so vital in preserving our peace and security. Sir, I am not for one moment suggesting that funds for research and development must equal defence funds. It would be folly on my part. I am merely stressing that budgets for research and development must be practically sufficient. In case the Hon. Senior Minister of State decides to ask for figures, I must hasten to add that this process will require time, and figures take time to produce and some types of figures take a longer time to produce than others. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to fight a good war, we need good soldiers and, in the words of a once-upon-a-time honourable Member, \"if you give them peanuts, you get monkeys.\" By the same token, in preparing ourselves to fight a successful international economic war we must have hardworking, dedicated, bright and intelligent soldiers, for whom we are prepared to pay to do the job. I am afraid we are living in a materialistic world. There is nothing very much we can do about it except, through a wisely-planned cultural and moral education, try to tone down the sins of materialism. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To attract people of good calibre, the department of research and development must be glamourised. Otherwise, those who are good and can contribute tend to gravitate towards more lucrative and prestigious positions. The effect of this is twofold. Firstly, the country loses the very people who are suitably trained for the work of research and development, and secondly, the amount of time, money and effort that have gone into training these people are wasted. Just as the Government has so carefully provided channels to cater for the academically-inclined and the technically-inclined, consideration ought to be given to harness \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the abilities of those who can execute the functions of research and development effectively. After all, this statement that we must not waste our human resource is fast becoming a cliche. Need I repeat it? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I venture to suggest that those involved in research and development in Singapore have so far been relegated to the backrooms eating humble pie, and perhaps gnashing their teeth in the process. The recent move by the Science Council of Singapore to award gold medals for outstanding achievements in applied research is indeed a move in the right direction. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Government's desire to promote research and development to accelerate the country's industrialisation drive, it would be worthwhile to ensure that just as it is undesirable to waste manpower, it is similarly undesirable to duplicate equipment. The various institutions involved ought to work on a kind of co-operation programme, especially in the use of extremely expensive equipment. Equipment must be stretched to maximum use for funds to be effectively utilised. Such a programme is bound to encourage a cross-fertilization of ideas in the inevitable intercourse that follows. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am confident that with a carefully drawn out plan, together with a team of first-class scientists, the work of research and development can be accelerated. We must not be caught with our pants down. With the world's economic outlook looking very dull and unexciting; with rising unemployment in some major industrialised countries; with the spectre of inflation stalking over the major parts of the world; with the four-stage oil price increase and a possible world oil shortage; with itchy fingers messing around certain third world countries and causing proxy wars; and now the idea of protectionism as a rather easy and unimaginative method of solving a sick economy brought about by over-luxurious living, we must be prepared. Hon. Members will recall we almost lost the advantage of U.S. multinationals operating in Singapore. We also did not foresee Australia's \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> ungentlemanly International Civil Aviation Policy and this behoves us to prepare ourselves always for the worst. Our research and development must therefore be at a level where our products can be made as reliable, as well-designed and, in fact, comparable to those from Japan and the other more industrialised countries of the world. Then only can we compete effectively and survive. We survived the oil-crisis, the British pullout, and if we prepare now we should be able to surmount any further economic frustration that is to come. Sir, we must be prepared, and I mean it seriously. I would therefore urge the Government to come up with a positive and clear plan for technology development in Singapore and to set aside funds as investment to develop this capability. I hope the Hon. Minister can provide an indication as to when such a plan can be expected. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister's suggestion to increasingly develop Singapore as a resort destination point in the Pacific is an excellent idea. It is worth remembering that at the planning stage the proposed resort complex should be developed as a complement to the ASEAN chain of resorts. However, this resort of ours must have unique built-in features and facilities that must reflect a high level of professionalism that is second to none and hard to duplicate. In this area of professionalism, the Government can perhaps encourage our local scientists to participate in what the Hon. Minister calls \"indigenous research and development.\" In this respect I suggest the animal world. Whilst we are developing our human resource to its utmost for our survival, I see no reason why the special features of local fauna should not be developed further and harnessed to promote our tourist trade. After all, the Americans have been very successful with their whales and dolphins; so why not we with our monkeys, apes and orang utans! There are, of course, other more representative animals. Sir, my main point here is to stress the importance of achieving a high level of professionalism coupled with originality rather than just the usual run of beaches and complementary facilities. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are working towards yet another phase of the tourist industry, we must not forget the already established shopping paradise in Singapore. The Consumers' Association of Singapore (CASE) and the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board have both been very successful in developing the image of Singapore as a reliable and generally trustworthy shopping paradise in this part of the world. CASE has also been working very closely with the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research to raise the quality of locally-made products. We must promote the sales of locally-made products side-by-side with the imported ones. This is very important and must be further encouraged. To create a greater demand for locally-made products, our indigenous research and development programmes must be bolder and more far-reaching and directed towards the Hon. Minister's idea of industrial products that are \"small, high value-added, readily transportable, non-pollutive, and which use relatively less natural resources such as land, water and energy.\" \n  <br>4.23 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff (Kolam Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, recognising the constantly challenging political climate with the stability of the world still far from ideal and compounded by a generally sluggish world economy resulting tom the oil price hike which had quadrupled, the Minister for Finance last year in his cautious optimism had predicted a GNP growth of between 6% and 8% for Singapore. And recently, on 5th March, 1979, we were informed that our GNP growth was 8.6%, i.e. 0.6% more than what the mind can gauge and analyse. We should be very grateful for this most encouraging achievement. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, every year the people, with hearts throbbing, wait to hear the speech of the Minister for Finance when he presents the Government's financial policy. There are those whose respiratory organs get blocked up should their cigarette puff \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> constrict their throats on learning of a tax hike on cigarettes. Similarly, for other items such as motorcars, liquor, or of measures like road tax, and income tax. How relieved they were to hear that none of these items was affected or the taxes increased. In fact I am confident that many people were somewhat surprised to hear that five tax concessions were given: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Deduction for CPF contributions increased from $4,000 to $5,000 per year, to take effect from the Year of Assessment 1980. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Tax exemption on the whole of the pension income with effect from this year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Exemption from estate duty on a house raised from $100,000 to $200,000 commencing next month. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. 10% special concessionary tax to income derived from general inward direct insurance business covering off-shore risks from Year of Assessment 1980. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Capital allowance for company-owned cars raised from the maximum of $15,000 to $25,000, with effect from next month. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen at a glance that the first, second and third concessions are intended especially for the individual citizen and his family, while the fourth and fifth concessions are designed for the businessmen and investors. Herein then lies the \"beauty\" of the policy of the concessions proposed by the Senior Minister of State for Finance. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three concessions for the individual citizen and his family, I am most impressed when the Minister in charge extended the concession to the whole pension income of resident pensioners. This means that Government revenue will be $290,000 less per annum arising from this concession. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very unique and positive attitude. Time and again Singapore has departed from the accepted universal practice. We know that, by and large, countries in the world impose a tax on their pensioners. And we are also aware that it is not immoral to tax pensioners. If at all, I describe it as morally pricking our conscience. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new stance and policy also characterise something original. Although it may be a universal trend to copy the policy of others, we have demonstrated that if we know very well that that policy is inconsistent, or that we ourselves have a better policy or an alternative to deal with the problem, we do not copy it. It is most important to acquire this ever forward-looking attitude in this fast- moving age - an era where it is not enough just to solve \"today's problem\", but that it must be solved \"at this very moment.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be people who think that this concession is insignificant as it brings in its rain a revenue loss of only $290,000. It may be true that this sum is a drop in the ocean when compared to the estimated revenue of $3,885 million to be collected. But the good gesture demonstrated by the Government is of no small significance. It has a great significance particularly to the pensioners who have spent the best years of their lives in the service of the Government and the nation; those who have reached the last stage of their journey in life; those who can look back to the service they have rendered. And because life in itself means to give, not to take, therefore whatever they have given of themselves to the nation and whatever the Government or the nation gives them today forms an attitude that is positive and a praiseworthy one. Also, this attitude of giving is the pith of progress, to the extent that, I am fully confident that at a certain point of time in the future (let us hope not) if the nation is confronted with hardship or danger, these people who have been imbued with this quality of giving will not hesitate to give, whether it is material, moral or even their lives. Believe me! Because life is to learn as well as to share. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the fourth and fifth concessions, I am confident that traders and investors would show their appreciation towards the purpose and objective of these concessions. And in Singapore which practises an open economic system, in the face of fierce competition, particularly from countries in this part of the world such as South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan which \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> have higher GNP than ours, it is hoped that these concessions will further stabilise our economic growth. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that the setting up of the proposed Research and Development Division will attract more experts, particularly our own citizens who are now abroad. Likewise, the recommendations of the Trade Development Committee will evoke positive initiatives in their promotional efforts. Besides other factors, these two factors, namely Research and Development and Trade Development Committee, will provide an equilibrium as well as a new lease of life in the nation's economic machinery. And the \"loss\" of $22 million from the concessions discussed above will just be an ant bite. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless it is imperative for us to be on our guard in respect of important issues which are whirling in the world around us, and which can affect and impede continued progress: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Discord that leads to war; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Spread of protectionist policy; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 Energy Resources. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, there is every truth in the saying, \"Beyond that dingy uniformity in the international fashion in dress, man remains what he has always been - a splendid fighting creature, a self-sacrificing hero and a blood-thirsty animal.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is happening in Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea, and what is happening in Afghanistan and Iran and other Middle East countries, conveys a certain significance, that is, men still continue to perpetrate acts which they recognise to be counter-productive. It seems to justify the cynical statement that men need not fear population growth or a population explosion on the ground that there are ways and means of stabilising the situation, such as family planning, etc, including stabilization through warfare which is inevitable at particular periods of men's lives. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events in those countries should also serve as an important object lesson to all of us that a country, which itself at one time \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> hated colonialism, could commit the same act that it abhors; that countries with the same ideology do not necessarily share the same objective or have identical tactics; that military might supersedes diplomatic power; that war is like an incurable cancer. It is an irony that this malady is infectious. One plain truth must be understood, and that is if countries of the same block can still be in discord, how much more then if the dissension is between countries of different blocks or ideologies; that a factor most disconcerting to sociologists is how to deal with a generation that has inherited decades of war atmosphere and to effect a change in their attitude of mind to a deep mentality of harmony, peace and brotherhood - generally to solve problems through the \"bullet\" and not the \"ballot\". \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider that this should also be recognised by every country that practises democracy. So long as the power of the \"ballot\" remains in the hands of the people, it should be used to the best advantage. For if that power is substituted by the \"bullet\", then with it goes the power of the ordinary man to decide his future by awarding the confidence to those in whom they entrust the monumental task of looking after their needs and destiny. A power which is very important indeed. For this purpose, I reproduce an excerpt from Sir Winston Churchill's speech in the House of Commons on 31st October, 1944: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'At the bottom of all the tributes paid to democracy is the little man, walking into the little booth, with a little pencil, making a little cross on a little bit of paper - no amount of rhetoric or voluminous discussion can possibly diminish the overwhelming importance of the point.' \n  <br> \n  <br>What has happened to our friends in the North - whether Vietnam and Kampuchea, China and Vietnam, Laos, Thailand - could not be settled by hope and prayer alone. A positive action has to be taken. We, the ASEAN nations, in conjunction with other friendly nations like Japan, should try to bring those who are at loggerheads to the conference table. Probably many will liken us to the unabashed suitor but, in the interest of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> peace and understanding, we should swallow such allegation with all sincerity and seriousness. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possibly by inviting Australia as well in this noble effort, we will be giving a broader impression of our seriousness in this matter but unfortunately this 'friend' of ours (Australia) is presently pursuing a narrow policy - protectionism. Her ICAP policy will prevent at least 100,000 Europe-bound travellers from Australia to make a stop-over in Singapore. This will mean that our tourist industry will lose about $100 million per year. Efforts that should otherwise be devoted to other more important and urgent problems have to be channelled to the formation of some sort of defence pact to counter this narrow-minded policy. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would mean that we should for the time being forget our 'friend' Australia until she learns that her policy does not pay. Meanwhile we have to look for friends who have the same aspirations as ourselves - that protectionism is not a policy that can help improve one's international economic life. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, finally, permit me to congratulate the Senior Minister of State for Finance for urging the people to work harder and to economise on the use of oil and electricity, bearing in mind the sluggish growth of the economy in the coming years. So far we have proved that we are a rugged community and are prepared to work hard. We have inherited these qualities over the centuries, or over the years at least. Our workers, housewives and even children at schools should be instilled with these qualities. Although we have done all this, it has got to be sustained. Amongst these good qualities we should also include the habit of saving energy. Some sort of campaign to save energy should be mounted. This campaign should also involve school children who form about one-quarter of our population, apart from the commercial houses and the industries which consume more than half of our total consumption of energy. With this, we hope to instill alertness in the community and dispel the \"couldn't-care-less\" attitude amongst the populace. To \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> realise how important this problem of energy is, it would be pertinent to turn the wheels of history and study the present-day realities and come to a conclusion. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man inherited a modest and limited beginning. Wood and animal waste was his source of fuel for heating purposes. Then came power from the motor which employed manpower and animals to operate. He also obtained power from natural sources like wind and water. With the discovery of coal in the 12th century in England, it took another six centuries before coal was used to obtain power from the steam-engine which in turn brought about the Industrial Revolution - a new era in the life of the modern man and with it also came the exploitation of the worker or the ordinary man. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the 19th century, oil was discovered from the oilfields of Pennsylvania. Oil became more and more useful. Its use increased in the 20th century. Experts in oil production predict that oil resources will be depleted by the year 2,000. What we should realise is the analysis made by a group of experts headed by Professor Carrol Wilson from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which states \"that a serious imbalance between supply and demand of energy will come as early as 1981.\" That is two years from now. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile we have read in the front page of a newspaper about the possible shortage and depletion of oil in the oilfields of the Middle East - a region that has been supplying world requirements of oil. Of the 160 countries in the world, very few have their own supply of oil. Most of them import their oil requirement, including the big industrial giants like Japan which imports 99% of its oil, Western Europe 96% before the discovery of the North Sea oilfields. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumania (The Ploestic Oil Fields) which at one time supplied the needs of its neighbours in Europe, can no longer supply its own oil requirements. The same with the giant, the United States. And if No. 13 is really an unlucky number, then there is the possibility that the 13 nations that form the OPEC countries which have raised their oil price by \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> 14.5% may still increase the price further. And we have also heard that there are plans by Kuwait, Libya and Venezuela to unilaterally increase the price up to more than 20%. All this shows how serious is this question of energy and also how imperative that the \"Campaign To Save Energy\" be seriously taken up by us all. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not taken into account the possibility of another Iran-type of incident happening in the other oil-exporting countries. If that happens, it could be worse. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, hoping that such a situation would not arise, let us ponder on the words of an energy expert, Nathan Glick, who said: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We have only a few decades to decide what alternative energy paths to take. The realistic choices seem to have narrowed down to nuclear power or solar energy OR some combination of these two potentially inexhaustible sources - with coal (more abundant but more dangerous than oil) as a transitional backdrop,\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise I would like to inform the House the warning made by Professor Carrol Wilson together with other international experts recently: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The world must drastically curtail the growth of energy use and move massively out of oil into other fuels with wartime urgency. Otherwise we face foreseeable catastrophe.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this note, I support the financial policy speech of the Senior Minister of State for Finance. \n  <br>4.45 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>( \n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Senior Minister of State for Finance, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, delivered his Budget speech in this House last Monday, not only did he not introduce any new taxes nor increase the rates of existing taxes but announced instead five tax concessions such that the 1979 budget becomes a painless one. This is a congratulatory gesture. He said in his speech that to assist product development, the Government intends to extend to new manufacturing companies the provision to deduct expenditure on research and development, and that the double tax deduction scheme will also apply to all \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> expenses incurred on advertising and promotional campaigns overseas, the production of sales literature and brochures and the undertaking of market surveys. This is a very enlightened move. With the continuous progress of our economy the focal point of our economy has already been shifted from one of trading to one of equal emphasis on both industry and commerce. Under these circumstances, only export-oriented trade in industrial products will further push our economy to reach a growth rate as planned. Promotional activities and market surveys are new marketing techniques which are usually employed by developed countries. Most of the manufacturers in Singapore are quite conservative in approach. They are parsimonious in investing their money in this field. Therefore, with the double tax deduction scheme, it will encourage the manufacturers to discard their conservatism and embark upon world market more positively and actively. This measure by the Government is both timely and proper. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also extends its tax concessions to income derived from general inward direct insurance business covering offshore risks and raises the maximum allowable deduction for CPF contribution and life insurance premia for personal income tax purpose. Undoubtedly, these measures will give a boost to our insurance business which is an important part in our financial system. Another tax concession relates to a house-property to be exempted from estate duty up to $200,000. This will further stimulate our property market which has been quiet for quite some time. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to touch upon some matters which I think have not been given adequate attention. With the shift in the emphasis of our economy and the changes in trade policies of our neighbouring countries, our entrepot trade which hitherto has been the main-stay of our economy, has been on the decline. Although our neighbouring countries have been attempting to have direct trade with other countries, we can still \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> play an important role in the entrepot trade in certain traditional produce such as rubber and pepper, because of our geographical location and our excellent infrastructures and our efficient international shipping services. However, the companies that deal in these entrepot trades have not been given any attention in the Budgets of the past two years. Perhaps the Government's contention could be that since these businesses have been well established all along or they are declining in importance relative to our industrial developments, there is no need to give them any assistance or encouragement. Of course we all agree that Singapore should step up her industrial development, especially in technology-intensive industries, but my view is that although entrepot trade has been declining in importance, we still have to give it some form of assistance so long as it continues to contribute to the growth of our economy. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to encourage and help our local building construction industry, the Government has decided to give a 5% margin of concession for Government tenders to our local building construction contractors. The motive is good. However, it is still not enough. Our economic policy is to welcome foreign investors including building contractors. As a result, foreign building contractors, particularly those from Japan, have already entered into our Singapore market. Singapore is developing rapidly in the field of building construction. Many big projects one after another, such as the Changi Airport and Pan-Island Expressway are either being implemented by stages or at the planning stage. These major projects, the implementation of which requires a high degree of technology and stringent management methods, are invariably awarded to foreign major companies which possess them. Once they have established their foothold in Singapore, they are also interested in small building projects. This poses a threat to our local building contractors as they have to face keen competition from them. In fact, from the buildings which our local building contractors have completed, such as the National Stadium, Paya Lebar Airport \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Passenger Terminals and some well-known commercial complexes, we can see that some big local contractors have already reached the levels of technology and management required for undertaking major projects. Quite recently, some of them had even formed a joint company to undertake overseas projects. In the face of keen competition from famous international construction consortiums, they were able to secure a major project in the Middle-East. This goes to show that our level of construction has met international standards. Government projects, if within the capacity and capability of our local building contractors to undertake, should be reserved for them. In cases where foreign expertise and knowledge are required, they should be encouraged to set up joint ventures with foreign companies so that they can learn in the process from foreign companies their advanced technology and management methods, and that in this way, they will be helped to grow from small into bigger enterprises to undertake more overseas projects. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we are developing into a regional as well as an international financial centre, we should not neglect one of the weak links in our financial system, that is, the finance companies. In view of the Government's discouragement of private ownership of cars, the weak recovery of the property market and the keen competitions by POSB Credit and other commercial banks, the business of finance companies is dwindling. In this difficult situation, the finance companies will have to find other outlets and to diversify their activities. But, because of the stringent control of the Finance Companies Act 1967 which provides not only for the requirements of cash reserves, the ratio of asset liquidity and minimum capital but also the prohibition of their dealing in foreign exchange, finance companies are finding themselves constrained in ever-dwindling business. If the Government will accord them the kind of assistance and treatment as it has done to the insurance industry and will relax some provisions to strengthen their business capacity, I believe they will be able to play a \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> more positive and active role in the financial field. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Senior Minister of State for Finance for the painless and mildly pleasurable Budget Statement he delivered on behalf of the Hon. Minister for Finance on 5th March, 1979 in this Chamber. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statement reminds me of the emphatic point made by the Minister for Finance in this House on 28th February, 1977, that \"we have laid a sound foundation for sustained growth through the five basic elements of our long term development strategy.\" He hoped to achieve an annual growth rate of 6 - 8% then. The result for 1977 was 7.8% which was slightly higher than the 7% achieved in 1976. And last year the Singapore economy grew by 8.6%. This is indeed an achievement. However, the Senior Minister of State did not make a forecast on the growth rate for 1979 except to point out that \"in the Year of the Goat, we should not lack the resilience, adaptability and co-operative effort to make 1979 another good year.\" He has only cautiously pointed out that \"in 1979, the world looks like becoming a more difficult place to make a living in.\" Perhaps he has got good reasons for not making any forecast on growth at all since this is the first time he is delivering the Budget Statement on behalf of the Minister for Finance. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, before I submit my humble comments on his statement, I would like to refer to the Radio and TV forum entitled \"Budget 79\" held two nights ago in which the Senior Minister of State for Finance was put on the carpet before a seven-man panel to discuss the impact and implications of this year's budget. Personally, I welcome this new approach. What I wish to ask is whether the hour-long discussion is sufficient time enough. After all, it should be noted that Parliament had to be adjourned till today for the debate on the Statement. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I come to my observations on some aspects of the Budget Statement. First of all, whilst the Budget Statement inflicted no pain but mild pleasure, I hasten to ask the Hon. Minister whether he will assure the House that no \"pain\" will be inflicted between now and his next Budget Statement. I can safely assume that he will give no such assurance because in reply to a question from the panel the Senior Minister of State indicated a possible price hike on energy. This caused me to read the Budget Statement again; and I notice that mention was made with regard to the \"4-stage oil price increase totalling 14.5% in 1979 by OPEC\", as well as the more sombre \"prospect of a world oil shortage following disruption from Iran.\" Towards this end, the Senior Minister of State at the forum merely exhorted that \"we should step up efforts to economise on the consumption of oil and electricity.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that we are able to withstand such increases? Will not Singapore's economy be affected by these increases? I would also like to believe that such hike in oil prices will affect our economy; more so with the prospect of an oil shortage. So I would like to ask what provisions have we made in this respect? Further to this, in the 11 o'clock news brief this morning, it was reported that the Japanese Yen has weakened against the US dollar because Japan will most probably face the problem of oil supply. The impact will be felt by the industries in Japan which rely very \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> much on an adequate supply of oil. In fact, just now before the House adjourned for a short tea break mention was made by the hon. Member for Kolam Ayer that Japan consumes or imports 99% of her oil needs. The Japanese economy is likely to be seriously affected in this respect, if what is conveyed over the news is true. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that I come to the question of protectionism which has already been touched on by several colleagues of mine on the Backbench. In his statement, the Senior Minister of State has referred to protectionism now being extended to the air and he pointed out that \"Singapore together with ASEAN and the Group of 77 developing countries must resist the protectionist tendencies of developed countries and help bring about an international order that will benefit the developing countries.\" I fully agree with the stand, but may I ask what form of resistance Singapore can pursue? Would it not be better to look for other solutions to overcome the protectionistic climate caused by the developed countries? One solution, if I may venture to suggest, would be for ASEAN to stand united and work closely with the Group of 77 developing countries with a view to exploring the ways and means to check against such climate. For ourselves, we should be more than prepared to acquire further knowhow or new skills in our export-oriented manufacturing sector whose products are not politically sensitive to the developed countries. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, until and unless ASEAN together with the Group of 77 developing countries can show themselves to the developed countries that it is futile and not to their ultimate interests to embark on such policies, I am of the opinion that these developed countries will continue to exploit the Third World for their own interests, be they short-term or long-term. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the question of ASEAN economic cooperation. It is gratifying to note that last year further progress has been achieved in ASEAN economic cooperation. It shows ASEAN's maturity in being able to function in regionalism within a short span of some 12 \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> years, and this is indeed a matter of quiet satisfaction to the peoples of ASEAN. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, I would like to refer to my remarks made on 14th March, 1977, contained in Hansard, Vol. 36, col. 889, when I touched on the need to \"laying greater emphasis on bi-lateral and multi-lateral trading arrangements with ASEAN countries.\" Now, apart from the Preferential Trading Arrangements concerning more items to be exchanged, I would like to know whether further progress has been made with regard to across-the-board agreements on the reduction of certain tariffs with our ASEAN partners. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to touch on Tax Changes. Whilst I appreciate the increase in the allowable deduction for statutory CPF contributions, to $5,000 per year, I would refer the Senior Minister of State for Finance to his statement made in this House on 14th March, 1977 when he was on this side of the House. This can be found in Vol. 36, cols. 831 to 836. His remarks centred entirely on an appeal for an increase in personal and earned income reliefs. He had made out a very strong case in this respect and, in fact, he had supported it with a Table of Comparison of Tax Liabilities and Disposable Income between 1972 and 1976 (Appendix II, cols. 907 to 908 of the same volume) and to quote him: \"This argument was basically sound but it was not carried far enough.\" I think the House will agree with me that he has carried it succinctly far enough, and I would like to enquire whether he still subscribes to this view. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> No. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, by this, I do not mean to be disrespectful, but I would like to remind him that the purchasing power of our dollar has been somewhat eroded further. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another aspect of tax concession concerning house ownership, I wish to seek further elaboration and clarification on the increase with regard to exemption from estate duty, i.e. \"any one house in a deceased's estate subject to a maximum value of $200,000.\" Also, \"The exemption \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> limit of $200,000 for the house will apply to the full share of any one house in a deceased's estate.\" And, \"If the deceased is a part owner of a house, the exemption will depend on his proportionate share of that house.\" In the view of the Senior Minister of State, \"this should cover most public and private flats, and terrace and semi-detached houses.\" May I suggest that it is best not to specify the number of residential properties that qualify for exemption so long as a person is able to enjoy the exemption limit of $200,000. In other words, it should best be left to him to do what he wants. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, another point concerns the inter vivos gift of a house. The Senior Minister of State said: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A house which is given as an inter vivos gift will not qualify for the exemption, notwithstanding that the value of the house is included in the valuation of the estate if the gift is made within five years of the date of death.' \n  <br> \n  <br>Now, Sir, for the purposes of estate duty any gift inter vivos does not take effect until five years after the date of the gift. That is to say, if the donor dies within five years of the date of the gift, his estate will have to pay estate duty on the whole value of the gift and yet his estate will not get the benefit of the recent exemption. Sir, to me this is illogical and the benefit of the exemption should be granted irrespective of any gift made within five years of the date of death. If the Hon. Senior Minister of State does not think that my argument is illogical I hope he will take the necessary steps to put the matter right. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to add that when assessment of an estate takes place, the Department concerned should be fair and reasonable in the assessment. I know of one case where the grown-up children bought a detached house in the name of their mother and they have been paying the instalments. Many years later, she died intestate and the house had to be sold to pay for the estate duty, leaving behind a paltry sum of money hardly enough to buy a terrace house. This happened in the early 70's when there was a boom in property prices. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Hon. Senior Minister of State to consider my suggestions. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, touching on consumer prices, (Part VIII, on page 42 of the Economic Survey of Singapore 1978) pork price, amongst other food items, registered a 3% rise despite a drop of 5% in pig prices received by farmers. Therefore, it would be pertinent to ask why the benefit could not be passed on to the consumer who had to pay for a 3% rise in pork price whereas the pig farmer got a 5% drop in pig price. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know whether it is in order to ask of the Hon. Senior Minister of State if he will elaborate further on his Addendum to the President's Address that it was Government's intention to sell off pans of its investments to the public. Let me hasten to add that I have no personal interest in this matter. Is it still too early to be disclosed, or is the Ministry still working out the details? Also, if he will elaborate on the utilisation of Payroll Tax which forms part of Direct Taxes for the Revenue; $75 million to be exact. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another small point, I think this is more a typographical error than anything else. It can be found on page 11 of Paper Cmd. 4 of 1979 under the heading \"Statement of Loans Repayable to Government (Partly Estimated)\", Housing and Development Board, item no. 35, \"6% Loan for Law Cost Housing, 1971/72 - Short Term.\" I think it should be \"Low Cost\" and not \"Law Cost\". No doubt this is a mere typographical error. There is a great deal of difference between \"law cost\" and \"low cost\". I hope a correction to this end will be done. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What do you mean by \"law cost\", Mr Ng? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Cost pertaining to law. In my debate on the 5th of March on the First Supplementary Estimates, legal fees can also be \"law cost\". So \"low cost\" is different. \"Low cost\" means that the cost is low. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I come to the conclusion of my observations on the Budget Statement. However, there is one small point that bugs \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> me. That is, I notice that foreigners are allowed to open supermarkets and departmental stores. Such enterprises would definitely have undue advantage over our local ones, namely, our NTUC and PIEU/SILO supermarkets which have to purchase in bulk and sell at a low profit margin to the consumer whereas these foreign enterprises may be able to obtain more favourable credit terms on consumer goods from their own countries. I must say that I am not prompted by the NTUC, SILO or PIEU to raise this matter. It is the result of one little observation that I made because I was astonished when I once popped into one supermarket and departmental store and was told that some of the items sold there were slightly more expensive than those sold in our NTUC or PIEU/SILO supermarkets, and yet large crowds of people throng there. I cannot understand this. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Government should allow such enterprises to function here. I understand that many of our retail shops have been badly affected and have, in fact, closed down. So this is not a benefit to us, and I can only hope that the Hon. Minister will do something about it. In short, I would like to suggest that the retail trade be done by ourselves only and not foreigners. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the Motion in the name of the Hon. Senior Minister of State for Finance. \n  <br>5.50 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>( \n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 5th of this month the Senior Minister of State for Finance presented on behalf of the Minister for Finance, the new Budget in this House. Contrary to the usual practice of the past years, he did not introduce any new tax or increase existing ones. On the other hand, he announced five tax concessions. This is the Minister's introductory present to this House. The Budget has also left a good first impression to the general taxpayers. However, to the masses of citizenry, when there is no new tax or tax-increase, it means that the burden of livelihood will not be increased for the time being at least. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Therefore, there is no reason not to welcome this Budget. Of course, the main reason for the new Budget to be painless is that our economy, with the joint effort of all the people, has enjoyed good progress - an 8.6% economic growth in the past year. As regards our economic structure, the Government has also succeeded in its diversification programme. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal and company incomes have also increased as a result. Therefore, the simple message of the Government to work hard for a better living, ought to be better understood by our people. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Budget reflects clearly our solid economic position, and together with political stability, they constitute the most favourable factors in attracting foreign investments to this region. The success of attracting new investments will, of course, strengthen our economic growth. But the Government should also at the same time pay attention to the increasingly serious problem of shortage of labour and to provide early solution. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Government's continual emphasis is on development expenditure while at the same time economising on recurrent expenditure. Of course, this is aimed to stimulate economic growth in the coming years. But, the much publicised and long awaited mass rapid transit system should be approved early by the Government, so that the activities in the construction of the system and its concomitant commercial activities will no doubt generate further economic growth. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, the new Budget has the characteristics which stimulate the healthy growth of our commerce and industry, as well as lightening the burden of the upper middle income group. As for the middle and lower income group, I see that they actually do not benefit much. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more important point is this, judging from the generality of the Budget, the Government does not seem to accord any importance in the encouragement of the development of a national culture. Many \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> people lament the fact that the economic prosperity of Singapore has made our people golden-calf worshippers, gradually degenerating them into soulless economic animals. To correct this undesirable tendency, it is necessary to fall back on the virtues of our cultural ballast and education. The Government should encourage our people to engage in all aspects of cultural activities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House last year, I advocated that the Ministry of Finance should grant tax relief benefits for any company or individual who bought any article of artistic value, so as to give the much needed impetus for our artistic creativity. I hope the Minister concerned will give a favourable response to my suggestion. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State, in announcing tax exemption on pension income, has been both humane and reasonable. He said, \"We have to be a hard-headed Government but we are not hard-hearted. Wherever we can afford to, we shall show in some tangible way that those who have served are not forgotten\". This heart-touching and humane statement has so touched me that I feel it necessary to speak once again on behalf of those retired teachers of the aided schools. These retired teachers have worked conscientiously for education and have dedicated their lives to our country. Because the CPF contribution was low during the time of their service, the amount they got upon their retirement was very meagre. If they were to buy a flat with their CPF savings, there would not be very much left. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner had they retired than they had to return their medical benefit entitlement cards. Society seems to be rather unfair to them. When one grows old, of course, one tends to get ill more easily. Therefore, now is the time when they need medical care most. While they have to look for jobs to make a. living and not always with medical benefits, on the other hand, they still have to save up something for medical care. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I earnestly hope that the Minister concerned will do his utmost to assist these \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> aged retired teachers, in the same spirit and by the same reason as he accords tax exemption to resident pensioners. \n  <br>5.57 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his first Budget statement, the Senior Minister of State for Finance said that, \"All in all, 1978 was a satisfactory year for us.\" This understatement of our economic performance sets the tone for the cautious and balanced presentation of the Budget. In my view, Sir, we have done rather well indeed. The GNP growth rate of 8.6% was the highest for the region and was more than twice the growth of the OECD countries. This performance was all the more satisfying because our rate of inflation was among the lowest for the world. It would be well for us to consider the policies that made this economic performance possible. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By conscious choice we have built a well-diversified economy. This diversification has provided us with the necessary resilience so that, in the last world economic recession, we managed to have positive growth rates while most other countries went under with negative GNP growth. Members will recall that in 1974 our GNP growth rate was 6.3% while in 1975 it was 3.9%. The diversified nature of our economy has enabled us to enjoy satisfactory overall growth rates even when specific sectors falter. In 1977, for example, the manufacturing sector was over-shadowed by the performance of transportation, communication and trade. Last year, transportation and communication was again the leading sector, although manufacturing had recovered somewhat to be a close second. Of course, diversification has its cost. Economies which are less diversified or are more specialised like Hong Kong enjoyed higher growth rates last year. However, such countries suffered more than ours during the 1974-75 recession. As we face an increasingly uncertain and difficult world economy, our diversified economy has more to commend it. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members may also note from the Economic Survey that South Korea enjoyed a 12 1/2% GNP growth last year but she suffered an inflation rate of 16.4%. Our consumer prices rose by only 4.8%. In other words, higher economic growth could have been achieved only at the expense of price stability. It may seem like rationalisation but, in my view, it is undesirable to attempt double-digit growth rates not only because of the inevitable inflation but also because unduly high growth produces severe distortions in the economy. We faced such a situation in the early 70's when cost of land and construction mushroomed so rapidly that the property market became severely distorted. It became impossible for many people who did not qualify for HDB flats to own their own homes. Hence Government had to build executive flats and start HUDC. Furthermore we may note that it is not really possible to gain experience or imbibe new skills too rapidly. \n  <br>6.00 p.m. \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, given the unfavourable world economic situation, we need not worry about the undesirable consequences of too rapid a growth. We do need to remind ourselves nevertheless that steady growth is achievable only by a necessary combination of factors. Government fiscal policy must be prudent. Out of a total estimated expenditure for the financial year 1979, 43% is for development. This is a healthy percentage. Moreover, unlike many other countries, our development projects are carefully screened to ensure that they are able to pay for themselves in the future with the exception of the social-infrastructure type of investment. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point of criticism is nevertheless warranted here. Last year Government current expenditure rose by 22%. In particular, purchase of goods and services rose by 16%, the bulk of which, according to the Economic Survey, was \"for current operational requirements such as stationery and office supplies, public utilities and maintenance of lands and buildings.\" I would \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> seriously urge our civil servants to be more restrained in such expenditure in the future. In the private sector, business image and sales promotion require glossy prints and pamphlets and expensive stationery. Government departments have no real need for such frills. What the public wants is prompt and courteous service, not glossy reports extolling the achievements of the various departments. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which Members may wish to note is that the total expenditure of the seven largest statutory boards amounted to $3 billion or 76% of Government's expenditure of $4 billion. Yet Parliament does not scrutinise the details of the statutory boards' expenditure. The budget which is being presented to us in Parliament constitutes only 57% of the expenditure by the entire public sector. It is about time that Parliament made up for the serious neglect. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to my discussion of the factors that have made possible our steady growth with minimum inflation, three other national policies deserve attention. One is monetary policy. Sir, we have followed a moderate course in expanding money supply to meet the liquidity requirement of growth without triggering inflation. This is a delicate task in view of the openness and smallness of our economy. It is a fine tribute to the health of our economy and the confidence we have generated that we were able, last June, to remove all exchange controls. By doing so, we have added to our attractiveness as a haven for investment. However, the price we pay is two-fold. One is the loss of some degree of freedom to set our own interest rates which are at variance with those of other financial centres. The other is the increased need for vigilance to avoid financial tidal waves from swamping or denuding us. Here, I would urge that special attention be paid to the Asian Dollar Market to ensure that it is not overly extended and that the integrity of the domestic banking system will not be compromised in any way. We have rejoiced over the phenomenal growth of the Asian Dollar Market from year to year, but we should be mindful that financial crises \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> worse than those experienced during the last recession can be expected in the future. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our exchange rate policy has been, by and large, correct. The problem is usually to adjust to external changes, for example, the decline of the US dollar, the devaluation of the Indonesian rupiah, and so on. We should be aware that the exchange rates are crucially affected by domestic fiscal monetary and wage policies. Profligacy in fiscal matters, over-expansion in money supply, and unduly large wage increases lead inevitably to devaluation. Hence, countries which pursue such policies are forced to devalue. We need not follow such devaluations, because we have a conservative fiscal policy, and our monetary and wage policies are moderate. If we choose deliberately to under-value our currency, our foreign exchange reserves would accumulate unduly fast, causing an over-expansion of money supply. This would in turn cause inflation, leading to a devaluation. It is then back to square one. The temporary export advantage is eroded subsequently by inflation and devaluation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wage factor is another important factor in our economy. The National Wages Council has emphasised moderation and the need to match wage increases with productivity increases. This is imperative for us if we are to survive and prosper, as we face an increasingly hostile world economic environment. Members are aware of the increasing protectionism in the industrial countries, not only for manufactured goods but also for services. And the new Member for Anson has reminded us with new examples of protectionism in the shipping industry. We welcome all multilateral efforts to reduce trade barriers, but we should not be too hopeful of the outcome. Domestic unemployment and inflation in industrial countries are making them inward-looking. Every one of the 98 countries involved in the GATT-sponsored Tokyo round of talks at Geneva has a long list of industries and projects that it wants exempted from the impact of the proposed tariff cuts. The lesson for us is clear. Hard work, discipline, hard- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> headed policies and thrift are vital for our survival in the years ahead. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Singapore public has been alerted to the energy crisis, at long last. After the initial scare of the oil embargo in 1973 and the subsequent dramatic increases in the price of petroleum, we seem to have become profligate again about using energy. The Iranian situation is a harbinger of things to come. Unless there is a dramatic breakthrough on the energy front within five years, the world economy is headed for turbulent times. We would be well-advised to adopt strict conservation measures and to accelerate the diversification of our energy base from its almost total dependence upon oil. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give my support to the financial policies of the Government as expressed in the Budget. \n  <br>6.08 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin (Bedok):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my colleagues in expressing our thanks to the Senior Minister of State for Finance for delivering the Budget statement on behalf of the Minister for Finance. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the financial statement on the budget for FY 1979-80 has brought joy all round, the Senior Minister of State for Finance must be congratulated and given full credit for his first budget, which he was fully responsible for the preparation and presentation in what he described as \"completely painless and even mildly pleasurable\". \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget contains a bagful of surprises in the form of tax concessions for the middle income earners, pensioners, and those who own homes. Sir, I do not propose to discuss the tax concessions as my colleagues have already touched on them in great detail. However, Sir, I was a little disappointed when no mention was made of the position of personal and earned income reliefs which have not been revised since 1948. I am even more disappointed because the Senior \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Minister of State himself was one of those who strongly advocated further increase in the earned income relief when he was a Backbencher. This subject has been raised by other colleagues in this House year after year but to no avail, as the Hon. Minister for Finance remains adamant about it. Sir, if I am allowed to quote what the Senior Minister of State for Finance said when he took up the issue as a Backbencher in the budget in 1976. I quote from Hansard, Vol. 36, col. 835: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let me ask, Sir, have we built a case for personal reliefs to be increased by, say, $1,000? I submit we have if the quantum of personal reliefs as originally allowed in 1948 is intended to apply in real terms to today's living environment. Some countries like Canada have introduced indexation to income tax reliefs to ensure that these reliefs remain meaningful when cost of living goes up. I suggest the Ministry of Finance study this possibility. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly buttress our argument for a tax rebate - for that is what it is if personal reliefs are increased - with economic arguments. The Government has vowed to make the economy grow fast again, at least 6 - 8% in real terms. The Government has also emphasized the desirability of keeping costs down, including wages. First, if personal reliefs are increased by $1,000, the tax loss to Government is $26 million. By the same token, the money pumped into the economy is $26 million, assuming this entire amount is spent by the recipients. This should help to stimulate the economy. With economic growth, the tax collections should increase and hence the ultimate tax loss to Government will be less than $26 million. The tax rebate of $26 million will not be inflationary as we are an open economy. It is instead expansionary. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to the individuals it is real disposable income that matters, not salary, not even take-home pay. If the real disposal income is inadequate to sustain a minimum expected level of living, there will be pressure by employees to have their wages increased. Tax is an important element of cost. So long as the Government can afford it, it is better to have as low a tax rate as possible so that the overall wage required by an employee will not be artificially pushed up. It is better to give a tax rebate, assuming Government can afford it, and have a lower NWC annual increase for the taxpayers who benefit from such a rebate, than to give a higher NWC annual increase in order to achieve the same real disposable income. The end result is lower labour costs with the same real purchasing power after tax. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads us to the final tantalizing question. Can the Government afford to give away $26 million? I shall leave it to the Minister for Finance to answer the question!' \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance in his reply, of course, said, inter alia, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'.... I would be very reluctant to give any special consideration. I do not know whether this has been the accepted practice in many other jurisdictions, and I am loathe to be the first to start in Southeast Asia, if not, in Asia. There was the question whether I could spare $26 million. The answer is, I can spare it if I can find it ....'. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I would like to learn from the Senior Minister of State for Finance is whether, in the course of preparing the budget, the subject of personal and earned income reliefs has crossed his mind. Has he really forgotten about it? Because nowhere in the budget was any mention made about the subject. I sincerely hope that since he is fully responsible for the budget, he should consider increasing the personal relief to $2,000, as he originally proposed, in his next budget. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world economy progresses at the rate of 3.6% per annum. In spite of the slow growth rate of the world economy and increasing unemployment in industrial countries, Singapore was able to keep the rate of unemployment down to 3.6%. Sir, what concerns me most is the gloomy outlook as reflected in the Senior Minister of State's statement on the state of oil, which might lead to another major crisis if the present political turmoil in Iran continues unabated and Singapore will have to turn to some other countries for her oil supply. The Member for Kolam Ayer has also warned us of the dangers of the shortage in world oil supply and the measures to be taken to conserve the use of energy. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while our economic forecast does not appear to be bright, there is still hope if we continue to develop at a fast pace and work even harder to ensure reasonable growth in the years to come. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his concluding remarks on economic policy, the Senior Minister of State predicted that, in spite of the sluggish world economy, he was confident that our economy would continue to do well so long as the people were prepared to put in their best efforts. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Budget policy, the Minister of State has given us tax concessions instead of introducing new taxes which would incur additional financial burden. Most Members, if not all, who have spoken before me, have touched on these concessions in greater detail and I do not propose to repeat more or less the same views already expressed. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the points that I have brought up, I feel that this year's budget and financial policy have brought forth happiness to many, and let us hope that Singapore will continue to perform better in the economic activities, thereby bringing prosperity to the people. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the Motion in the name of the Senior Minister of State for Finance. \n  <br>6.17 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is really encouraging to see you in the Chair. I promise I shall behave as well as if Mr Speaker is in the chair. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid that this year's budget debate has to be an anti-climax in this House, as all the important issues have been efficiently, competently and adequately expounded over the TV forum. I wish to remind hon. Members that if they intend to propose any cuts in the vote for the Ministry of Culture on mass media, they will have to bear in mind the power of the mass media. It therefore leaves us, Members of this House today, to discuss only the more mundane issues and not high finance or economic theories. Of course, several Members have indeed impressed this House very much, not only with their delivery but also for the meat of their speeches. I am afraid therefore that I would have to join in this anti-climax. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although all the important issues have been disposed of by the effective replies and arguments put forth by the Senior Minister of State at the TV forum, all is not lost, however, because none of us have touched on the manpower expenditure. There are several points I wish to raise here which ought to be raised in the Committee of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Supply but, because they occur so frequently, I feel that I might as well raise them now in the general debate. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I intend to discuss today is what I would call \"justification of Government administrative blunders.\" If we were to look at the budget for manpower, $603 million will be spent on salaries and wages alone. With the frequent lapses in the lack of humanity in the various Ministries, it is timely for me today to strike a little chord of warning so that we will not lapse into the same behavioral patterns as in the colonial days. There are many mistakes - I would say they are quite genuine mistakes, if I may use the term very loosely, but, a mistake is a mistake. The Government has been brave enough to admit them, although not all, Sir. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, several years ago, the Member for Punggol raised in this House the question of tax relief for aged parents. He was a very gallant man, Sir, to raise this question and taking on the then Minister for Finance. And true to his colours, the Minister stood in this House and replied to the hon. Member saying (Vol. 29 col. 85) that filial piety is a virtue in Asian society and so why should one be so mercenary as to ask for tax relief for parents? I thought it was a good argument. Fair enough. Bearing in mind my own training and my own cultural background, I thought that was a very good reply. However, the present Minister for Finance - I do not know whether it was out of his good heart, but I always believe he has one - agreed to grant a tax relief of $300 for the maintenance of parents. In other words, filial piety can be quantified - $300! The Minister's generosity did not stop there. A year later he increased it to $750. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we are not complaining about this, but it just goes to show that, where filial piety still remains a virtue in our society, we have, within a short period of a few years, two different approaches to the same problem. One said it was mercenary. The other said that the father was worth $750. If you employ a gardener, you have got to pay more, Sir. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question of tax relief for the wife and children. I have just asked my colleague, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence (the Minister for Home Affairs would not tell me), how much the Ministry spends a year for the upkeep and maintenance of the Provost Dog Unit. He said, \"It is a very expensive affair. It requires two NCOs to handle the dogs, and the dog food will probably cost about $3 a day for each dog.\" May I at this stage - before I allow myself to make further mistakes - say that I have no intention at all to compare our wives and children with dogs! But unfortunately, it is a good example to show how much we are worth, if we could only find out the amount of money spent on the two Dog Units. Of course, in the Police Force there are different grades or streaming - the more intelligent dogs would be the Narco dogs, the less intelligent ones would be the guard dogs. So how much money is spent on maintaining one dog per year? And we are expected to maintain our wives at $1,000 a year, $750 per child up to a maximum of two children. This scale has been there for years. No adjustment has been made so far. Ten or 15 years ago, I would imagine that an allowance of $500 as relief for maintenance of a child was more than enough. But in 15 years everything has changed. The consumer price index has gone up. The cost of living has gone up. Our children are still worth $500 each, and with a little generosity, a bargaining off, it has been increased to $750 per child only if we have two children. I do not know how they justify that. Is it a mistake? Is it a blunder? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here also we have a very good animal lover in the Member for Mountbatten who prompted the Minister to consider training the animals, apes, monkeys, and so on. I believe our Ministers, particularly the Minister for Finance, are all canine lovers. Better treatment is being given to dogs than wives and children! If they do increase any tax, they collect it immediately. They announce it on 31st December and the next day the tax goes up. But if they give us a concession, we will get it next year. Of course, we are jubilant over the concession for CPF contributions. But some trade unionist \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Members raised this question: \"Why not change the personal relief scale, instead of giving a concession for CPF contributions?\" The answer was, \"No, no. We want to have a wider tax base.\" When they give concessions, they do not want to have a wider base. How do they justify this? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also reminded, Sir, of the statements made during the by-elections by the Minister of Defence-designate then. I have to be extremely kind to him, Sir. Since he promoted me to a Major in the Army, probably because he had heard of my reputation when he came in. I have to restrain my comments, but I do wish to quote him. The Minister-designate said during the election campaign, that the former Member for Potong Pasir - Mr Ivan Baptist - I can call him by his name now, Sir - fought the bureaucracy while he (Mr Baptist) was an M.P. What the Minister of Defence forgot to mention was that Mr Ivan Baptist fought bureaucracy, and lost! Now he has taken over Potong Pasir! He added, \"I can fight bureaucracy better because I know how it works.\" And he was the former Head of the bureaucracy! If bureaucracy is something that needs to be fought, it must be something evil. Therefore, this is the main theme of my discussion today, \"justification of administrative blunders.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to go into ideological or philosophical arguments. Let me get down to a few real life examples. There was an acquisition exercise somewhere in Tampines, and to their horror they found that the piece of land which was supposed to be acquired - it was gazetted for acquisition - had already been developed into a beautiful estate! If I am not wrong, it is Tampines Garden. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Phua Bah Lee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence (Mr Phua Bah Lee):</b> Tampines Wood Estate. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Tampines Wood Estate. Thank you very much. They had to evict the residents! The residents said, \"Look. Allow us to stay on. We will upkeep the garden for you.\" They said, \"No dice. You get out.\" So they moved out. Grass grew and \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> window panes were broken. So they offered these houses to the airlines. There were no takers. In the end, they had to get the former tenants back - those tenants who were living in their own houses and had to pay rent. What I was told was that those houses were not meant to be acquired but because of an administrative goof it was not plotted on the General Improvement Plan (GIP). You see, once a piece of land is developed, the houses will be plotted on the plan. In this case the plan for acquisition showed \"lallang land\" and therefore it was a very cheap piece of land, so it was red pencilled and marked out for acquisition. Later, they found that there were houses there, and they could not de-gazette it because this would create a precedent and would apply to other places. How could they gazette this? What happened? How do they justify this blunder? I do not know, This is one example. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was an example of a woman who lost her citizenship - in five minutes - and got it back after three rather naughty letters from me. I am not claiming any credit, but I just want to show an example of the Government machinery which operates with total ignorance of the real life situation of Singapore, our people, our culture. This woman met me and said that she lost her citizenship. I asked her how did she lose it. She said, \"i don't know. I was told to go to the Identity Card Office with two photographs. They withdrew my pink identity card and gave me a blue identity card.\" I wrote to this Office. They replied that the date of birth on her old identity card did not tally with that in the Birth Certificate and she could not therefore prove that it was her Birth Certificate. Subsequent letters of appeal were written and I got the same reply. I sensed that this woman was wronged and so, in one of my meet-the-people sessions, I asked my staff to borrow a Chinese almanac from next door. On going through the almanac, I discovered that the date of birth on her old identity card was exactly the same as that shown in the Birth Certificate but it was based on the Chinese calendar. This is an old practice! So I wrote to the National Registration Office and Citizenship Registry and she got her citizenship back. My next \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> question is: How many more such cases are there? The point is when we deal with our people, we must understand their cultural background. There should be a checklist so that even a non-Chinese officer who comes across such a case would be able to go through the checklist first before revoking the citizenship. I asked, \"How many more such cases are there?\" The officer replied, \"We don't know, Mr Fong. I really don't know myself.\" This is one goof. How does one justify this? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the Registry of Companies. The Management Services Department moved into the Registry of Companies and recommended that to save costs, the Registry should do away with the telephone operator and that each officer should have a direct line. So if you want to ring the Registry of Companies to speak to an officer on a certain subject, you will just have to ring any of these lines. But the very senior and highly paid \"telephone operator\" at the other end would say, \"Sorry, this matter does not concern me. It is the other officer. Please ring this number. I cannot transfer the call because this is a direct line.\" For every six telephone calls I make, according to the law of averages there will be five wrong numbers! All this just to save the cost of a telephone operator? Justification of a blunder? They say it is efficiency! \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was the Member for Stamford and before my \"resettlement\", I made a proposal to erect an overhead bridge at the High Street junction, so that traffic could proceed ahead. The only function of the traffic light there was to stop the traffic just to allow the pedestrians to cross the road. I received a reply saying that it could not be done because the site there was encumbered with underground services and they had no money. A few months later I saw construction work going on there. I rang the PWD and asked what was being done in my constituency. They said, \"Oh, we are going to construct an overhead bridge.\" On hearing this, I vigorously opposed the idea. After about ten minutes of discussion, the officer said, \"Well, if I am not mistaken, Mr Fong, it \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> was your proposal that we are now talking about!\" I said, \"But then you told me the site was encumbered with underground services.\" He said, \"Oh, we have now found out that it was not so.\" then while they were building the bridge, they issued a statement saying that the PWD was building it, I have nothing against them, Sir. They were doing good work. It is a natural tendency of the so-called experts and professionals that every time a layman, and an MP in particular, proposes an idea, they will not implement it even if they agree to it, because if a layman can provide a solution when the experts cannot, they should not be there any more. This is a typical example of cutting you down first because \"we will do it ourselves..\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also happened in my proposal for the provision of canteen space in multi-storey buildings. I raised the question with the Ministry of the Environment at a meeting chaired by my colleague, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, with the URA representative. Their impression was this: \"We build a multi-storey building. To put a canteen inside is un-becoming of a good architect?\" The answer was no. It took them three months to reply to the Ministry of the Environment who conveyed their decision to me that it could not be done. A multi-storey building should not provide this kind of service because they expected the clerks and the sales girls to eat at the restaurant in that building? They would probably eat up their salary in three days! But, four months later it was declared as a matter of policy that multi-storey buildings should have canteen space for the staff! So they will slaughter you first, have the idea re-hashed, or re-born, so that it will be one up for that ministry. i am not challenging them for doing good work. Neither do I envy them. What I wish to inform Members is their attitude towards suggestions from Members of Parliament. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is another very interesting case. We know that it is very difficult to get money from the Government. Sir, I claim the credit of getting one dollar from the Government. I was to be blamed, Sir, for delaying payment of my road tax. When I decided to pay, the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> tax went up! Rather unhappily, I went there to pay my road tax. The officer said, \"Well, you have to pay so much now.\" Reluctantly, I paid. Six months later I received a letter. The only politeness in that letter was the word \"please\". It was a cyclostyled letter. That means there were many similar cases. The subject matter read: \"Re: your car number .... short payment, $2. Please see the undersigned on receipt of this letter with your registration book ....\", and so on. They made a mistake, and I received a cyclostyled letter saying, \"Come and see me with your book\" So I wrote in, not on Parliament letterhead for fear of being accused of browbeating the civil servants. (The Minister for the Environment here had accused me of trying to be a hero. I will come to that point later.) I inquired from them as to how I had short paid $2. They replied that the tax should be this amount and not that amount and so I had short paid $2. I wrote again saying, \"When I approached the officer, I paid the amount as demanded. Therefore, there was no question of a short payment.\" They replied that there was a change in the tax rate and the officer in charge had miscalculated it, resulting in an under-collection of $2. I contended that \"under-collection\" is quite different from \"short payment\". In the case of a short payment the liability was mine. I asked them under which provision of the law that a member of the public has to pay to rectify a mistake of the Government. A reply came promptly, \"Please be magnanimous. Pay the $2.\" We have to pay for our magnanimity! I wrote back saying, \"In the spirit of magnanimity I will pay, but only on condition that you promise by return of post that you are prepared to pay for my transport cost to get down to your office, my time taken to attend to this matter and the cost of one registered letter.\" A reply came back again, \"Please pay in order to be magnanimous.\" Finally, I told them that in the spirit of magnanimity, I would waive all charges except $3 as a token fine for their mistake. As a result, after the deduction of $2 which I owed them, they now owe me $11. I received a reply enclosing a receipt for $2 and $1 cash. That $1 is still in my file. I shall have to frame it up. (i did not indulge in illegal activity \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> on receipt of the $1, Sir. I was tempted to do so, but as a good Member of Parliament, I did not.) I managed to get $1 out of a Government department. But I lost $19 in the end. I wrote them a letter, this time on my letter-head, saying that I did not do so in the past for the reason which I have stated earlier. Now that commonsense finally prevailed, there was cause for celebration. I did so in the form of a donation of $20 to the ROV Officers' Sports Club. $19 was my own donation and the $1 from the Government department for their penance. It was yet another justification for a mistake! They make a mistake, you pay for it, being a good citizen. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can go on, Sir, giving many other examples. But I am afraid you will rule me out of order. We have to confine ourselves to discussion of the general principles of the Budget Statement. The examples which I have quoted do illustrate that at times there are lapses in the Civil Service in implementing Government policies. We spend $603 million on manpower and salaries alone this year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must state here, and I think the Minister for National Development would be pleased to hear it, that I do enjoy extremely good cooperation from the Resettlement Department. These officers were or are - I hope they still are - quite enlightened. But at times they can only be enlightened after I have enlightened them. There was a case of resettlement. A farmer was offered an alternative piece of land. There were two brothers and two pieces of land were offered. The elder brother moved in first. After some months the younger brother bought all the timber, planning to move in on to the new piece of land. But the elder brother said, \"Don't, this land is again being acquired.\" So the younger brother did not move in, but in the end he lost all his claims for the original compensation on the grounds that he had failed to take occupation of the land offered. But the land offered was once again acquired. The matter lasted for six years until I went to the constituency. I charged the Resettlement Department for expropriation and then they agreed in the end to pay what \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> they call \"ex gratia payment\". They cannot call it \"compensation\" because that would mean admitting their mistake. They had to justify their mistake by calling the payment \"ex gratia payment\". That is one example. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is that frequently we find that in resettlement cases a family will approach the Resettlement Department saying, \"Can I have two units because my son is now married?\" The standard reply reads, \"When we did the census, there was only one family unit. We cannot now give you another unit.\" I took the matter up with the Resettlement Department and asked them to produce the law which says that once a family has been censured for resettlement, no member of the family can contract a marriage. I do know, Sir, that in my old constituency some places had been censured for resettlement but no clearance for ten years. We do not expect a young maiden to wait 10 years to get married! Does it mean that if a person gets married, he or she is not entitled to a house? Sir, on that argument the Resettlement Department relented and agreed to offer an additional unit, albeit on a rental basis. At least the family has a place to stay. There were several similar cases. On the same argument each of them obtained an additional unit. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately or unfortunately, their brains did not stop working, as far as the resettlement officers are concerned. To my amusement, one day I received a letter from the Department in reply to a similar case of a request for an additional unit. It stated, \"We regret to inform you that we are not able to offer you an additional unit on the grounds that your marriage was not consummated.\" Sir, for 17 years as a Member of Parliament, I have never come across such logic or argument, I replied to the Department and, among other things, I stated, \"Since civilization began, a matter such as the consummation of a marriage is not normally done in the presence of a witness.\" The Housing Board took on the role of the High Court. They almost nullified the marriage. Only the High Court can decide whether or not a marriage \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> is consummated and only upon a complaint by either of the parties. In this particular case, although there was no complaint, they ruled that the marriage was not consummated! See how do they justify a blunder? The reply to my two-page letter was indeed very short. \"Please refer to your letter dated so-and-so. I am pleased to inform you that the couple has now been offered an additional unit.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, I can go on giving examples. My intention here is to bring to the attention of the Ministry of Finance, the MSD, and particularly those people who implement policies, of the need to be flexible, humane, and to bear in mind the kind of people they are dealing with. Strict adherence to the rules is good. But they should allow some flexibility. Rules are made to guide the civil servants to work more efficiently and expeditiously. The Instruction Manual runs into three volumes. But they are based on past experiences to help the officers to discharge their duties in the most efficient, expeditious and humane way. But unfortunately, some of them allow themselves to be tied up in knots by the same Instruction Manual which is designed to help them. The examples which I have quoted are not that serious, but if we do not check all these minor lapses here and there, many citizens will be wronged. In the example of the identity card case which I quoted earlier, if that citizen were to approach a Member of Parliament who is not conversant with Chinese culture, she would have been wronged for the rest of her life. For one citizen to be wronged, that is bad enough, Sir. There is no recourse to litigation because if she were to go to court she could not prove that it was her certificate until a little detective work on culture was done by an MP. These lapses should remind us that there should be some check lists in the various Ministries. If they are confronted with a situation there should be a check list with which they can go through the various points before taking the rather unpleasant action, say, revoking the citizenship of a person. It is a serious matter, Sir. Regarding my query on how many more such cases, there was no answer. Since we spend $603 million on manpower and salaries, should there not be a \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> special unit set up, perhaps under the MSD, to look into lapses like those I have just mentioned? The unit can propose some guidelines as to the degree of flexibility that can be allowed under certain circumstances. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an unpleasant thing to have to resettle people but they generally accept that resettlement is for the benefit of the State. The principle should be that whilst no one should benefit from resettlement, neither should the people suffer as a result of it. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important that this special unit be set up as quickly as possible because as we increase the tempo of development, the officers tend to be more and more indifferent and they follow the book more and more. \"After all, I draw a day's pay. I follow the guide book. If certain things cannot be done, they can see their Member of Parliament.\" A Member of Parliament can only offer to his people his sincerity, his willingness to work hard for his people, but he cannot offer all the solutions, still less provide answers for administrative stupidity. I do not think that is the role of the Member of Parliament. Fortunately, our meet-the-people session is a good bridge between the people and the Government. From our experience, we can gauge the general feelings of the population. But I do not think that is enough, Sir. What should be done is that the various departments should have their own guidelines on certain cases, particularly citizenship. It is a serious matter, and yet these guidelines are absent. They are merely following rules. And if the Minister for Finance can allow a provision in the MSD - first of all, the MSD themselves must be enlightened - and if all the Ministries were to suffer the same fate as the Registry of Companies where all the officers have direct lines, then we have to find another MSD to advise the MSD. It is important, Sir, that these lapses here and there should be checked. And it is all these grievances that sway the general mood of the people. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note and with the hope in mind that the Senior Minister of State will respond to this suggestion to check the various lapses in the Ministry, I rather reluctantly associate myself in supporting the financial statement. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> It is painless and a rather mild surprise, because the pain will come afterwards. \n  <br>6.49 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, last December the world was shocked when the 13-nation OPEC cartel announced a general increase of 14.5% in the price of oil for 1979. OPEC tried to cushion the shock by spreading the increases over four stages throughout the year. Then events moved fast. A political crisis in Iran erupted. In a few short months of incessant political turmoil, export of oil from Iran plunged from 5.5 million barrels a day to nothing. Even if the Iranians should now resume exports, the future is bleak. Iranian oil will cost an incredible US$20 per barrel. But what is made worse is that other countries will now follow Iran's example, and there is a possibility of OPEC announcing another increase beyond the 14.5% it has already set for this year. It is not an un-imaginable situation as oil is always in short supply and many developed countries which need oil badly are prepared to pay any price for oil. The so-called \"spot market\" has also contributed to the spiralling price of oil. With spot prices reaching dazzling heights of US$30 per barrel as a result of speculation by middlemen, the temptation is there for OPEC countries to join the rampage. The sky appears to be the limit for the price of oil. This will have serious effects on the world economy. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflation is bound to take its toll on developed as well as developing countries. More US dollars will flow into oil producing countries adding to the vast billions already accumulated by these countries since the last oil crisis. This means a further weakening of the value of the US dollar against other major currencies and will in turn undermine the international monetary system. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very evidently the world is in a critical stage. It is on the brink of falling headlong into its second economic crisis in five years. The important thing to us is what we as Singaporeans, subject to the effects of events happening elsewhere and which are beyond our control, can do to brace ourselves for \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> what the Senior Minister of State for Finance has said would be an \"uncertain and wintry economic climate.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take positive steps to reduce our consumption of energy. A few days ago when the Senior Minister of State for Finance performed on television, he warned of the possibility of higher prices for energy because of the oil shortage and price hike. No rightminded Singaporean will chide him for that. On the contrary, we should be grateful for his warning, and begin to take steps to conserve energy. It was perhaps unfortunate that after the first energy crisis of 1973/74 when Singaporeans were first made conscious of the need to conserve energy, no further serious efforts were made to sustain the drive to reduce consumption. For Singaporeans, the first energy crisis seemed to have gone as fast as it came as few realized that the luxury of switching on electricity at the touch of the fingertips is a luxury that has become too precious to waste. Even as OPEC was announcing their price increase last December, Orchard Road was buried in an orgy of dazzling lights as hotels competed with one another to see which had more and brighter lights during Christmas - indeed a very appalling situation if you consider the amount of precious electricity that must have been wasted during that period. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State's warning though somewhat late, is better than never. We have two options: either cut back on our consumption of energy or face the prospects of energy rationing. The latter is something we rather not have if it can be avoided, and avoid it we can by painstakingly taking every conceivable measure to save on the use of energy. I can think of a few examples, e.g. economising on the use of air-conditioning in buildings (this Chamber included), switching off the lights and air-conditioning during lunch breaks, bathing in cold water instead of heating it, cutting down on unnecessary journeys by car thereby saving on petrol, restricting the use of illuminated advertising signboards. Sir, the examples I have given may sound petty but a little bit \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> saved here and a little bit saved there all adds up to a pretty big sum. There are indeed numerous ways we can save energy if we stretch our imagination a bit further but every individual has to play his part. The Government on its part must in no way relent on its efforts to drive home the message and if necessary take measures against those who persist in flouting the national effort towards saving energy. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion standing in the name of the Senior Minister of State for Finance. \n  <br>6.55 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Tan Cheng San (Paya Lebar)</b>( \n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion moved by the Senior Minister of State for Finance on 5th March, 1979. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement this year is very much welcomed. In view of the pessimistic economic preview of the world economy, the Government is cutting down its usual expenditure and trying to find new sources to increase revenue. On the other hand, it tries hard to ensure that our country's economy will continue to maintain a certain growth rate despite the influence of the poor state of the world economy. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of a diversified economy mitigates our dependence on certain industries. Thus we can reduce the danger of certain industries being heavily hit by a world economic recession. Our country is changing from one of entrepot trade to industrialisation and development as the Servicing and Financial Centre for this region. This proves that a diversified economic development is one of the important elements of our country's continued progress towards prosperity. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a correct move by the Government to emphasise the development of economic services and raise efficiency, especially when the world economy is facing another imminent oil price hike. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note that our economic policy on industrial development is aimed at raising the workers' production \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> value and switching on to more refined products. This policy directly raises our workers' skills: hence it will further raise our workers' standard of living so that they can have a better life. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to reduce the ill effects on our economy through protectionistic measures employed by the advanced countries, it is necessary for us to develop small scale industries of high value and high techniques which economise on land, energy and are non-pollutive. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orderly and controlled wage increases suggested by our National Wages Council has enabled our industrial products to compete vigorously and to sell well in the international markets. \n  <br>6.59 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Senior Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, had the Budget which I described as painless received nothing but pleasurable tributes, I would have been sorely disappointed: first, at the lack of mental vigour and the inquiring spirit of the MPs and, secondly, I would have considered the Budget to be somewhat of a failure, that is, if I had not received any reservation or comments on the Budget. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In presenting the Budget, the Finance Ministry and I have to take into consideration past performance, present situation and future imponderables. The Budget has therefore to be objective and to be aware of imminent difficulties in the world economy. Thus, even though the Budget is painless, it is not aimed at gaining complete popularity. It is not possible. No Finance Minister, and certainly not the Finance Minister in Singapore, is a Santa Claus distributing goodies to each and everyone in the country. What we can do is wherever possible to take a little sometimes and give a little wherever we can. Therefore the Budget, as Members have correctly expressed their reservations which I shall answer in due course, is not one that can please everybody even though it is completely harmless. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I come to the specific points raised by several Members of the House, I would like to dispose of the criticism that a television forum was held even before the representatives of the people had a chance to debate the Budget. I make no apologies for the forum. I regard the Budget as a document of national interest, and it is important that as many people as possible are given a chance to debate the budget as soon as the Budget statement is made. The Finance Ministry or the Finance Minister, or I myself who had a hand in the Budget statement this year, not only have to face the representatives of the people, i.e. the Members of Parliament, but also the people of Singapore. The television forum is only one additional step taken by me to explain through the mass media to the people through a panel of experts certain logic or rationale behind the Budget. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise the problem, however, that the Budget could forestall discussion by Members of Parliament but I have faith in the Members of Parliament that the forum would not deprive them of issues to raise just as they have done today despite the forum. It is a question of timing. It is not possible to have the television forum after the Budget debate because the Budget statement would have undergone thorough examination after a session in this House. In fact, even among the members themselves, one member felt that the hour-long discussion was not long enough. I hope he did not mention this with tongue-in-cheek. But the fact is true that an hour-long discussion would not be sufficient to pre-empt issues that would be raised by Members of the House. So I trust Members of the House understand the logic behind the television forum. I trust that the television forum, while discussing various issues of importance to the people of Singapore, has not robbed any Member of the House of the capacity to debate, to make reservations, or to criticise the Ministry. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to divide my reply into two sections, one dealing with concessions and the other on general economic matters. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On concessions, reservation was expressed by several Members of the House \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> on the budget not taking into adequate consideration the lower income workers who did not enjoy the benefit of an increase in the exemption limit for CPF contributions, I also had to sit through some embarrassing moments listening to my own arguments when I was on the other side of the House arguing for a case for personal and earned income reliefs to be upped. I would like to explain that I was convinced by the Minister for Finance as to the logic for not increasing the personal and earned income reliefs and I hope, in the course of the next few minutes, to be able to convince them so that this issue would not be raised again and again. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to increase the personal and earned income reliefs by $1,000, the loss of revenue would be $26 million, and the tax base would be narrowed by about 10% to 20%. It is not possible to give an exact figure because there will be newcomers to the tax range and we cannot accurately pinpoint how many newcomers will get into the tax bracket. Also, if we were to increase the personal relief by $1,000 everyone will benefit but not by the same absolute amount. Those in the lower income group, whom Members of Parliament feel passionately for, will benefit by $50 because their tax rate is 5%. But those in the higher income group who have a marginal tax rate of 40% would benefit by $400. The measure will therefore appear to be regressive. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On pension, I am happy to note the general support for the concession given to pensioners. There was, however, again criticism of the sin of omission on the part of the Finance Ministry, i.e. those pensioners who are not paying tax do not enjoy this particular concession, and arguments have been advanced that they are, in fact, the people who should also enjoy similar recognition from the Government for their hard work in the past. The answer to that is that if they do not pay tax, it is not possible to exempt them from paying tax. Our first step in granting some tangible recognition to those who have served is not to take away from them. At a later stage perhaps, when \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> we can afford it, we could consider a further step, i.e. giving something to those who deserve it. This was done in 1974 when the new Singapore allowance was introduced for pensioners with a monthly pension of less than $650. They were given an ex gratia payment, having taken into account the steep rise in the cost of living following the oil crisis. I can assure Members of the House that my Ministry monitors the plight of these pensioners, and if later events prove that a similar ex gratia payment is necessary, I am sure the Government will not be hard-hearted. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On estate duty, I notice that the increase in the exemption limit was welcomed by Members of the House. But two points were made by the Member for Punggol. The first point was whether the exemption cannot be extended to more than one house. I think that point can be considered. If we were to exempt, as was intended in my Budget statement, only the first house up to the limit of $200,000 there is a possible interference with ownership pattern. Husbands and wives normally would have joint ownership of a piece of residential property. Some families are fortunate to be able to own two pieces of residential property. If we were to exempt only one house, that is the first house, from the enhanced limit, then for estate planning purposes I could envisage a shift in ownership pattern. That means that instead of a joint ownership of two houses either one would have sole ownership of a single house. I do not think that is desirable. So the point raised by the Member could be considered. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point of inter vivos gift, here we run into some legal technicalities. If a house is gifted by a donor to a donee, that house is legally the property of the donee. If the donor unfortunately dies within five years of the gift and we allow the exemption limit of $200,000 to apply to that piece of property, we are allowing an exemption on a property that does not belong to him. We have also to look at the situation where it is also possible that, through some unfortunate event, the donee may die before the donor, in which case he will be able to claim exemption up to $200,000 on that piece of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> property. Thus we have a case where it is possible to have two persons claiming the exemption on the same piece of property. For that reason we have decided that inter vivos gift will not be exempted from the increased exemption limit of $200,000 if the donor were to die within five years of giving the gift. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the public assistance scheme raised by the Member for Jalan Kayu, one can of course always quarrel with the meagre sum made available to recipients of such assistance. But the fact is that the rate of assistance to the unfortunate recipients was revised only in March 1976 and I believe it has been revised on the average once in three years or so. Whether or not the quantum is adequate, one can generally agree that the more you give to them the better it is for them, but one has also to balance the needs of the recipients against the general availability of such funds for running the administration and for various other purposes. Anyway, the subject of the quantum of public assistance belongs to the Ministry of Social Affairs but I thought I had to respond because ultimately they would refer to the Ministry of Finance. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On general economic matters, I can assure Members of the House that their liberal advice on how we should run the economy will be taken heed of. There was general understanding of the need for conservation or reduction of energy consumption and the adverse effects on our economy as a consequence of an oil supply disruption and an oil price hike. We will therefore, in the course of the next two months, work out a programme to ensure that Singapore consumes as little energy as is practically possible. The Public Utilities Board will be launching a campaign sometime in mid-April to teach the population and industries where and how they can conserve energy. We will monitor the effects of the campaign. We will follow up with fiscal measures, if necessary, and even quantitative measures, if necessary. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also strong support from several Members of the House on our programme to have a scheme for long-term research and development to assist primarily \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> local industrialists and industries. We shall, of course, tap resources in the tertiary education for this as well. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On local industries, the Member for Jalan Kayu concluded that silence means failure. The fact that no mention or reference was made to the Small Industries Scheme should not be regarded as synonymous with failure. I will give some figures on the effectiveness of the various assistance schemes to local industrialists. For the Small Industries Finance Scheme started in October 1976, 91 local companies have been granted 110 loans amounting to $15.17 million. For the Capital Assistance Scheme which was started in 1975, 13 applications have been approved with a total loan of $44.7 million. The Product Development Assistance Scheme which was started in March 1978 had also drawn some response, but I would agree with him that the response could have been better. So far, three companies have been supported with a total grant of about $200,000 while three others are under consideration. The others who applied were not supported because some of the applications did not meet the criteria laid down by the Ministry and the Economic Development Board. Since this is a grants scheme, it is important that every application is examined carefully and thoroughly to ensure that no spurious applications succeed through lack of thorough examination of the merits of the application. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no magic formula in my mind for encouraging local industrialists to venture or expand into manufacturing companies or to induce those who are not in manufacturing to invest in manufacturing industries. We can only provide the framework for them. We can, however, be flexible and be open to suggestions by the would-be entrepreneurs in industry as to how the scheme can be improved. I can assure Members of the House that effectiveness of the various schemes is being monitored and there is rapport between the EDB and members of the public who are interested in the scheme. Over the years the schemes have, in fact, been expanded and amended to suit the requirements of the economy. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an observation made by the Member for Jalan Kayu that Government appears to be dragging its feet in the formation of the Trade Development Council. The Government has not taken a hasty decision in this respect because the participation of the private sector is crucial to the success of the Trade Development Council. A Trade Development Committee was formed with private sector participation and unless the private sector themselves are convinced as to the need for a Trade Development Council and understand how the Trade Development Council should be run to serve their needs, it is better for the Government not to take a decision on its own to form a Council without the warm and enthusiastic support of the private sector. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Committee has made certain recommendations to the Ministry which have just been received and these recommendations will be looked into. If we are convinced that these recommendations will help the private sector to export their products, we would only be too happy to approve and implement the recommendations of the Trade Development Committee. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree, however, that we should upgrade the standard of our Commercial Secretaries abroad and that we should set up more offices abroad to channel inquiries, to understand the overseas markets, and to feed such trade inquiries back to the exporters in Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, on tourism, it would appear that the sin of omission has drawn the attention of the Member for Jalan Kayu. Whilst no mention was made in the Annual Reports of the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board about the collective effort on ASEAN's part to attract tourism into ASEAN, we cannot conclude that no collective effort was made. But the point is taken that wherever possible Singapore should work in concert with the other four members of ASEAN to promote ASEAN as a destination region for tourists so that in coming to ASEAN they also come to Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a specific suggestion by the Member for Mountbatten that we should, if I understood him correctly, set up an animal farm where local fauna can be exhibited and shown to tourists. He may not be aware that we have a zoo in Singapore where we have adequate numbers of orang utans and apes. He might also wish to know that they live on food besides peanuts. Peanuts alone would not sustain them. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. I am quite aware that there is an ultra-modern zoo known as the Singapore Zoological Garden in Mandai. But my suggestion was more than that, Sir. In fact, I have pre-empted the Hon. Minister's reply. That is why I drew a specific parallel with the American experiment of using whales and dolphins to exhibit their skills. My suggestion was actually to train our orang utans to exhibit their skills, Sir. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Thank you for the clarification. But I submit that the skills can still be exhibited at the zoo. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a specific request by the Member for Khe Bong that Government should consider, in some tangible way, recognising the contribution of the working population. The suggestion was that Government should make an annual contribution to the Labour Foundation. My reservation here is that there are others who also make contribution to the economy. If we were to make a contribution to the Labour Foundation, I would not know but employers could also set up an Employers Foundation and ask for contribution, because I think they can also justifiably argue that their contribution to the economy is as great as the workers. I do not, however, intend to cast aspersion in any way on the contribution of the workers. That is recognised by the Government. The only excuse is perhaps an omission to mention it specifically in the Budget. But it is not possible to mention everything and every person's contribution in the Budget because to do so I would have to stretch the Budget Statement by perhaps three times its length. Of course, I must not forget the contribution of the Members of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Parliament in the economic performance as well. And despite the tripling in length, I am sure there will still be omissions because if we look for omissions in any statement we can always find them. But I take the point that wherever possible the Government should recognise the contribution of the workers and appreciate it. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also criticism or reservation that the 5% preferential margin for local contractors would not be sufficient to enable them to compete against foreign contractors. That may be so but we have to bear in mind the objective of the scheme as well as the wider repercussions on the economy. The objective of the scheme is to grant a margin of preference to the contractors. But the margin must never be so protective that inefficient contractors can succeed in getting a job. To be effective in protecting certain local contractors, perhaps the margin would have to go up to 25% or 30% and that will be a cost to the economy in terms of higher cost of buildings. At the same time, the purpose of getting our local contractors out of Singapore to compete for jobs will not be served because under the high protective margin contractors would prefer to look inwards into the domestic market and thereby not improve their efficiency. The point is that if they are unable to compete in the local market with a 5% margin, I do not see how they can compete outside Singapore where there is no preference margin. If anything, the preference margin will be for the local contractors in the foreign countries. The point is made that we should encourage and give a helping hand to our local contractors but not to the extent that such assistance becomes a permanent prop without which they cannot live. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some comments were made by Members of Parliament, including the Member for Tiong Bahru, that foreigners should not be allowed to set up retail outlets in Singapore. Perhaps this is a price we have to pay for being an open economy, wanting foreign investments in Singapore and, in fact, even encouraging foreigners in Singapore to compete with the locals so that in the process of competition efficiency will be \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> upgraded amongst the local population. Given the lack of natural resources, the small base of our economy and the fact that manpower, other than strategic location, is about the only asset which we have, we have to take a conscious policy to ensure that the local population, given time, will be as efficient and as competitive in terms of production of output as any foreign country's population. We live by exports, and with an economy that is plugged in to the world economy, unless our manpower is efficient enough to be able to compete internationally, including competition against foreigners in Singapore, sooner or later we will find it difficult to sustain, let alone try to upgrade, the standard of living. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On protectionism, since Members of the House share my view perhaps there is no need for me to repeat that we are all against protectionism. But one Member did ask what specific measures we can take against the protectionist policies of the developed countries. Unfortunately, beyond working together with our ASEAN colleagues and the Group of 77 developing countries in international fora, there is very little we can do by way of specific measures or counter-measures against protectionism practised by not only the governments in the developed countries but also trade unions, as recently expounded by the Member for Anson. We will continue to lobby in international fora against protectionism, and we hope that the collective voice of the Third World will prevail against the weight of protectionism practised by the developed countries. It would be counter-productive if we were to introduce protectionist measures in Singapore. Fortunately nobody has suggested it as a specific measure against protectionism practised by others, because to do so would be to set off a further round of protectionism and thereby give further excuses for developed countries to enhance their protectionist measures. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question was asked as to what has happened to the across-the-board 10% tariff reduction that was proposed some time ago. The proposal was superseded by the collective desire of ASEAN countries as a \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> whole to have this exchange of 50 items initially, now increased to 100 items, each time they meet under the Preferential Trading Arrangement. There has been no further progress in the proposal of across-the-board tariff reduction that was suggested by some countries in ASEAN. Instead the five members are pursuing fairly earnestly with liberalization under the Preferential Trading Arrangement of exchanging 100 items per time per member. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry of Finance's Addendum to the President's Address it was mentioned that in the course of the next few years the Government would sell off some of its shares in some of its companies. There was a question as to whether this has been done. This has not yet been done, It is still too early. We mentioned \"in the course of the next few years.\" I am sure in the course of the next few years we will implement what we have stated in the Addendum. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a howler regarding \"low cost housing\" and \"Law cost housing\", but that was not the only typographical mistake, unfortunately, in the Budget Command Paper. Other errors have been spotted by my Ministry. (Cols. 657 - 658) They should not have occurred, but they have occurred in the rush to prepare the bulky, voluminous Command Paper after it was approved by the Cabinet. In the rush certain mistakes had unfortunately occurred. These errors will be corrected and the amendments given to the Members of the House as well as those who have a copy of the Command Paper. There were no other serious howlers except perhaps for the mistake where, instead of \"Half-yearly\" it has ended up as \"Haly-yearly\" [page 18]. The rest are minor mistakes which will be taken care of. \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1979/19790314/19790314-HA-0380657.htm\">Ministry - THE BUDGET FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1979/80 (Cols. 657 - 658)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion by the Member for Jurong that tax reduction should be considered for artistic works, a matter which he had raised a year ago, I am afraid that we have not decided that such exemption or tax reduction should be given for artistic works. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> There are problems of valuation, but more important is the priority consideration. He could perhaps argue from his point of view, and justifiably so, that at this point of time we should perhaps give consideration for artistic expressions by way of tax reduction. But we could also argue that now is not the time, but perhaps when the economy is more firm, when we are less troubled by future imponderables and when we are confident that uncertainty in the future would not rock the economic boat, that could be the time when we could be more liberal. In other words, the answer is no, but it will be considered at the right time. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Chai Chee gave us several interesting anecdotes which he has lumped under the theme of \"justification of administrative blunders\". He wanted a response although I do not know how to respond to his vivid account of anecdotes. But perhaps I can make a suggestion to him - if he can find the time he should compile all these anecdotes, similar to the work that has been done by Mr C.C. Leong under the title of \"Youth in the Army\". If he does so, and I think they are interesting anecdotes which contain lessons for the civil service as a whole, I can then assure him that I would try my best to make it compulsory reading for the bureaucrats. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered most, if not all, of the points that have been raised in the House. If I have not, I would suggest to Members to raise them under the appropriate Heads by moving an amendment to cut the vote by $10, or to ask questions for oral answers. And to those whom I have tried to give an answer this evening but could not satisfy them, please feel free to pursue the matter because if we cannot convince Members of the correctness of our decision, then Members should try and convince us the other way. Only then can we arrive at the right decision or a decision that can satisfy everybody. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been given credit by several Members of the House for the Budget and also by the Minister for Finance prior to my \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> presentation of the Budget that all credit would be due to me, it was my work and therefore the credit should be entirely mine. That I disagree. I would agree, however, with the silent implication that all blame or failures in the Budget will be mine. I decline to accept any of the tributes given to me for presenting the Budget because it is possible to have such a painless Budget only because every one in the Government, the workers, the managers, the people of Singapore, every one of them has put in his share of hard work over the last 20 years. The Government, including Members of Parliament in this House, has taken the right policy decisions, even tough decisions, in the past to ensure that the economy today is resting on very sound footing. The credit for the painless Budget therefore must go to the Government, the workers, the Members of Parliament in the House and generally the people of Singapore for making it possible. If we want a repetition of such painless Budgets, I think the lesson is: we keep on working the way we have been working and, even better, improve on our performance so that we would always have sufficient revenue to finance current and development expenditure in Singapore without the need for the Finance Minister to levy additional taxes. Better still if the economy can be enlarged and made to grow at a rate that can allow concessions to be given. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, has deliberately been toned down so that none of us would get the impression that we have done very well and therefore now is the time for us to enjoy the fruits and relax and liberalise completely, and to have more concessions or bigger concessions than those that have been given. I am therefore very happy that several Members, in particular the Member for Anson, have underlined the undertones of the Budget, that is, whilst we have done fairly well to-date, the future is indeed very uncertain and therefore we have in the next one or two years to consolidate our position and prepare ourselves to face an uncertain economic future. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1979 to 31st March, 1980. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Hon Sui Sen]. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    Adjourned accordingly at Nine \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    minutes to Eight o'clock p.m. \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1979/19790314/19790314-HA-0380653.htm\">Official Report - MAIN AND DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 1979 TO 31ST MARCH, 1980 (Cols. 653 - 656)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1979/19790314/19790314-HA-0380657.htm\">Ministry - THE BUDGET FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1979/80 (Cols. 657 - 658)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br>  \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
