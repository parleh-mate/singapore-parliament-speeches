One of the main principles  was  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people. So I would like to  touch\r\n\r\non  the  labour  policy of the Government  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether the balance in the interests of labour  is\r\n\r\nmaintained. At that time it was announced  in  the\r\n\r\nbooklet  that the P.A.P. was the workers' movement\r\n\r\nand  it  had  always received the support  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers. The P.A.P. Government is a government  on\r\n\r\nthe  workers'  side.  Although  we  recognize  the\r\n\r\nlimitations of our entrepot trade, our economy and\r\n\r\nthe  necessity  for  private capital  and  private\r\n\r\nenterprise, it is our duty to see that the workers\r\n\r\nget  a fair return for their labour, without which\r\n\r\ncapital  would  be barren and fruitless,  and  the\r\n\r\nwealth and prosperity which labour produces ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> On a point of order,\r\n\r\nSir,I think this is now the time for consideration of Head 0902, and\r\n\r\nI hear the Member for Delta speaking on -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, Mr Tang. Under\r\n\r\nthe revised times, we are still on the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am sorry.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was saying that the workers\r\n\r\nshould  get  a reasonable share for their  effort.\r\n\r\nWithout this basic condition, even if we have  the\r\n\r\ncapital, entrepot trade and other facilities,  the\r\n\r\nlabouring class who produces the wealth  will  not\r\n\r\nget equal benefit, and there will not be a balance\r\n\r\nof  interests.  So  if we want  to  be  prosperous\r\n\r\nthrough  industrialisation, hut we cannot succeed,\r\n\r\nit  is  because good working conditions and  other\r\n\r\nbenefits  to  the workers cannot be procured,  and\r\n\r\nthe  workers  will not get their rightful  reward.\r\n\r\nThe present situation, however, very clearly tells\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore that the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nis  looking  after them well. Ever  since  we  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. came to power, we have all along abided  by\r\n\r\nthese tenets or promises which we have made to our\r\n\r\nelectorate up to now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we re-examine our present declared policy, we\r\n\r\nwill  find that perhaps the Government thinks that\r\n\r\nbecause Singapore has achieved independence it can\r\n\r\nlose  sight of this declaration that was made some\r\n\r\ntime   ago.  Some  workers  have  been  neglected,\r\n\r\nespecially workers in the Jurong industrial  site.\r\n\r\nTrue,  Singapore must industrialise  in  order  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the livelihood of its two million people,\r\n\r\nbut  very  clearly we have this policy which  says\r\n\r\nthat  we  must achieve a balance of interests,  in\r\n\r\nother  words, we must look after the interests  of\r\n\r\ncapital as well as the interests of labour. If  we\r\n\r\nexamine  the actual conditions of the  workers  in\r\n\r\nthe Jurong industrial site, we will find that they\r\n\r\nhave  been  exploited in their  wages.  The  money\r\n\r\ngiven to them can be regarded only as an allowance\r\n\r\nand  not  as actual wages, because they, who  have\r\n\r\nbeen producing goods for their employers, are only\r\n\r\ngiven  meagre  allowances, not even  amounting  to\r\n\r\nwages, if I can call it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also touched on this matter of wages\r\n\r\nearlier. Normally a worker gets $2.50 per day. But\r\n\r\nthe  answer  given by the Minister  is  that  this\r\n\r\n$2.50 is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregarded  as  wages  but as an allowance,  because\r\n\r\nmost  of the workers are unmarried and this  is  a\r\n\r\nsort   of  allowance  given  to  them.  But  after\r\n\r\ninvestigation, I found that it is not actually so.\r\n\r\nThis sort of policy therefore actually contradicts\r\n\r\nthe announced policy of the P.A.P. Government.  If\r\n\r\nyou  regard these workers as apprentices, then  it\r\n\r\nis  not right. In the past I have tried to rectify\r\n\r\nthis abnormal situation, but we can still find  it\r\n\r\ngoing  on  in the Jurong industrial site.  I  have\r\n\r\nfound  that  many of the workers who  are  getting\r\n\r\n$2.50  per day are actually married. The  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said  that they are unmarried, but  after  my\r\n\r\ninvestigations, I have found that they are married\r\n\r\nwith  children.  So this policy, in  actual  fact,\r\n\r\ncontradicts the P.A.P. announced policy on labour.\r\n\r\nI  feel  that an erroneous conception has been  so\r\n\r\nformed so that the employer looks down upon  women\r\n\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that when we say that we want\r\n\r\nto  help  the  workers, we mean that the  workers'\r\n\r\nunions  concerned will look after  their  members.\r\n\r\nBut  many of the workers in Jurong do not join any\r\n\r\nunion. Firstly, they get very low wages. They have\r\n\r\nto  spend  more than $1 a day when they travel  to\r\n\r\nand from their places of work. For lunch they have\r\n\r\nto spend about $1 per day so that when they return\r\n\r\nhome  they  have nothing left for their family  if\r\n\r\ntheir  wages  are only $2.50 per day.  Because  of\r\n\r\nthis,  the  workers do not join any  trade  union.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  this, the employers exploit  them  so\r\n\r\nthat   all   their  claims  have   been   ignored,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  claims  of  women  workers,  like\r\n\r\nmaternity benefit and medical care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I think  it\r\n\r\nis  not  quite true to say that female workers  in\r\n\r\nfactories  in Jurong are getting a very  low  pay.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Sample Household Survey conducted\r\n\r\nin  July  1966,  the average monthly  earnings  of\r\n\r\nfemale  workers  of  18  years  or  above  in  all\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industries  were  $100.80  cents  a\r\n\r\nmonth.  There may be workers who get more or  less\r\n\r\nthan  this  amount. But the problem  is  that  the\r\n\r\nwages  they  earn  are closely  related  to  their\r\n\r\nskills.  The higher the skill, the more they  will\r\n\r\nearn. Take, for instance, a worker in a shirt  and\r\n\r\ngarment       industry.

In fact, I would like  to  pay\r\n\r\nmy  tribute to the President and Deputy  President\r\n\r\nof  the Courts for their past work in handling the\r\n\r\nmultifarious cases that have been presented in the\r\n\r\nFirst  and  Second  Courts. But whatever  point  I\r\n\r\nraise to indicate the present state of affairs the\r\n\r\nparties concerned are now in, may I emphasise that\r\n\r\nit  is  not the fault of the courts but it is  the\r\n\r\nfault  of  the system in operation that is  to  be\r\n\r\nblamed? The present method of having panel members\r\n\r\nfrom employee and employer groups does undoubtedly\r\n\r\ncause  unwanted and unnecessary delay not only  in\r\n\r\nhearings but also in the making of awards. Sir,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Relations Ordinance lays down that\r\n\r\nthe  award  shall be handed down within two  weeks\r\n\r\nafter  the parties concerned have presented  their\r\n\r\narguments. The fact that no one in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour  or  the  Advocate-General's  Chambers  has\r\n\r\nqueried  why  the Ordinance has not been  followed\r\n\r\nindicates that all have accepted that this is  not\r\n\r\npossible. Under the circumstances, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister if we are not defeating the very\r\n\r\npurpose   for  which  the  Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourts  were set up. The policy of the  Government\r\n\r\nwas  and,  I hope, still is industrial peace  with\r\n\r\njustice.  But I ask, can we have industrial  peace\r\n\r\nwith  justice if there are delays in handing  down\r\n\r\nthe  awards  which sometimes last for  months  and\r\n\r\neven  more  than a year after the cases have  been\r\n\r\nheard?   Of  course,  both  the  unions  and   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  may admit that they do  have  justice,\r\n\r\nbut a rather belated justice. Meanwhile, there  is\r\n\r\nfrustration among the workers and this frustration\r\n\r\nmust  necessarily affect production, a matter with\r\n\r\nwhich, I am sure, all of us are concerned. I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  something  must be done  to  accelerate  the\r\n\r\nhearings and the making of the awards of the cases\r\n\r\nby the courts. Have the Minister and his officials\r\n\r\ngiven  thought to this matter? They  may  be  very\r\n\r\nbusily   occupied   with   other   matters.   But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, I would like to suggest this for the\r\n\r\nMinister's consideration and sincerely ask him  to\r\n\r\ngive  his  urgent  attention  to  this  matter.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the  courts should  have  permanent\r\n\r\npanel  members. In other words, either the members\r\n\r\nof  the  management  and the employees  should  be\r\n\r\nengaged on a full-time basis, or do away with them\r\n\r\ncompletely  and  let all the  cases  be  heard  by\r\n\r\neither the President or the Deputy President only.\r\n\r\nMy  other suggestion is that the Minister appoints\r\n\r\nonly  panel  members who can afford to  spare  the\r\n\r\ntime. If a member, having been nominated to sit on\r\n\r\nthe  cases,  finds himself unable  to  attend  the\r\n\r\nhearings on, say, three consecutive occasions,  he\r\n\r\nautomatically  disqualifies himself  from  hearing\r\n\r\nany                 further                 cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, if you stop now, the\r\n\r\nMinister will have three minutes to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I think, in short, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bras Basah has suggested that  we  do\r\n\r\naway with the panel members. I am not sure whether\r\n\r\nthis   is  feasible  because  the  panel  members,\r\n\r\nwhether they are employers or employees, are there\r\n\r\nto   assist   the  President  of  the   Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court to weigh the pros and cons in  a\r\n\r\ngiven case and together they form the court. If we\r\n\r\nwere  to do away with the panel members, then  the\r\n\r\nPresident  would  be  left  alone  to   make   the\r\n\r\ndecision, and since the decisions on the awards of\r\n\r\nthe courts are not subject to appeal to any higher\r\n\r\ncourt,  it  may  appear that  the  burden  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident in making his decision is too  heavy  as\r\n\r\nto be unbearable and at times he may be accused of\r\n\r\nbias or being arbitrary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the suggestion on the setting up of\r\n\r\npermanent  panel  members, I do not  think  it  is\r\n\r\npossible  because, firstly, it is not possible  to\r\n\r\nget  enough suitable persons from the trade unions\r\n\r\nand  the  employers'  side to serve  as  permanent\r\n\r\nmembers  in the panel, and, secondly, the cost  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining such a permanent panel would be  quite\r\n\r\nprohibitive  and, in some cases,  it  may  not  be\r\n\r\neconomical  to do so because for some  periods  of\r\n\r\nthe year there may not be any case for the members\r\n\r\nto hear at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion put forward by the Member\r\n\r\nis  that  the Minister should appoint  only  panel\r\n\r\nmembers who cart afford to spare the time. If that\r\n\r\nis the case, I do not think this would be workable\r\n\r\nbecause  nobody  actually worth  appointing  as  a\r\n\r\npanel  member can actually spare the time, and  in\r\n\r\nthat  case we would not have any panel members  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This shows the farsightedness and the\r\n\r\ndeep thought given by the Government of the Republic of Singapore. This policy is in keeping with\r\n\r\nthe principles of nation building, that is, in\r\n\r\norder to build a strong nation, we must first have\r\n\r\na strong and healthy people. However, there is a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of dissatisfaction among sports\r\n\r\ncircles in Singapore today with certain members in\r\n\r\nthe National Sports Control Board. Mismanagement\r\n\r\nand the erroneous views of certain members on this\r\n\r\nBoard have produced some bad consequences. The\r\n\r\nGovernment has been trying to promote sports in\r\n\r\nrecent years. Towards that end, it has been trying\r\n\r\nto reorganise the sports organisations. However,\r\n\r\ncertain members holding responsible positions in\r\n\r\nthe Sports Control Board have behaved in a\r\n\r\nprejudicial manner. I feel that this behaviour\r\n\r\nshould be corrected. In the past, the sporting\r\n\r\nactivities in our country were under the\r\n\r\nmanagement of the Singapore Olympic Council. But\r\n\r\nthis year, as a successor to the Singapore Olympic\r\n\r\nSports Council, there has\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  established  a  body called  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Sports Control Board which manages  all\r\n\r\nmatters pertaining to sports. However, there  are\r\n\r\nno  experts on the Board who are conversant  with\r\n\r\nthe   technique  of  volleyball  and   basketball\r\n\r\nmatches.   Sir,  I  would  like  to  recount   an\r\n\r\nincident. The recent SEAP Games were meant mainly\r\n\r\nto  raise  the  standard  of  sports  of  certain\r\n\r\ncountries in this region where the standards  are\r\n\r\nlow.   Compared  with  some  other  international\r\n\r\nsports  meets,  the SEAP Games  standard  is  the\r\n\r\nlowest.  It is the lowest among all international\r\n\r\nsports meets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what kind of standard did we use to select\r\n\r\nour team members? Did we base our standard on the\r\n\r\nOlympic Games or the Asian Games? In what  events\r\n\r\nof  the Olympic Games did Singapore's contingents\r\n\r\never win any gold medals? If our sports teams are\r\n\r\nnot  sent  abroad  to  compete  in  international\r\n\r\ngames,  how  do  we expect them  to  raise  their\r\n\r\nsports  standard?  We will be  just  closing  our\r\n\r\neyes. The relevant authorities have said that the\r\n\r\nselections were based on quality and not on  quan\r\n\r\ntity.  Of course, I agree with this. But what  is\r\n\r\nthe  quality  required? Is it  that  the  members\r\n\r\nselected  should be up to the standard that  they\r\n\r\ncan  expect  to win gold medals? If that  is  so,\r\n\r\nthen  the selectors must have been very sure that\r\n\r\nthe  members selected for the SEAP Games must  be\r\n\r\npeople  who  had already reached the  gold  medal\r\n\r\nstandard.  But  there were many members  who  got\r\n\r\nonly  zero  back from the SEAP Games,  especially\r\n\r\nthe men's table tennis team. Since it was claimed\r\n\r\nthat  selection was based on quality and  not  on\r\n\r\nquantity,  what happened to those teams  selected\r\n\r\nto  represent us at the SEAP Games who  got  zero\r\n\r\nmarks  back for Singapore? Were they affected  by\r\n\r\nThailand's sunny weather so that there  was  some\r\n\r\nsort  of  chemical reaction which  changed  their\r\n\r\nquality  and which was different from  what  they\r\n\r\nhad  expected  it to be? There is some  suspicion\r\n\r\nthat  there  was bias in selecting our contingent\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our volleyball team under the able\r\n\r\nleadership of our Minister of State of Defence\r\n\r\nhad made much progress. They had been training\r\n\r\nsince June last year. There were four collective\r\n\r\ntraining periods per week. There had been 200\r\n\r\nsuch occasions totalling some 400 hours. This\r\n\r\nvolleyball team can be said to be one of the most\r\n\r\nhard-working teams among our sports\r\n\r\norganisations. The women's team also improved\r\n\r\ngreatly its standard. Recently at the match with\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian women's volleyball team, the\r\n\r\nSingapore team defeated them 3 - 0. At the recent\r\n\r\nSEAP Games, the Malaysian women's volleyball team\r\n\r\ngot the bronze medal. The Burmese team got the\r\n\r\nsilver medal. The Burmese team defeated the\r\n\r\nMalaysian team 3 - 1. So judging from the\r\n\r\nstandard of our team in April, our women's\r\n\r\nvolleyball team's standard was not only higher\r\n\r\nthan that of the Malaysian team, but was also\r\n\r\nhigher than that of the Burmese team. They can be\r\n\r\nsaid to be a match for Thailand's women's\r\n\r\nvolleyball team. Yet the selection committee said\r\n\r\nthat our volleyball team -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I  should\r\n\r\nsay  that  the  committee concerned was  actually\r\n\r\nbehaving like a blind man groping for the tail of\r\n\r\nthe elephant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are 15 organisations under the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Olympic  Sports   Council   and   the\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Council had very close relations\r\n\r\nwith seven of the organisations. Recently, out of\r\n\r\nthe  11  organisations which had members  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  contingent to the  SEAP  Games,  seven\r\n\r\norganisations were under him. I would like to ask\r\n\r\nhow  many  gold,  silver or  bronze  medals  were\r\n\r\ngained by these seven organisations? How many got\r\n\r\nzero  marks  back? The idea of holding  the  SEAP\r\n\r\nGames, other than enabling all countries in South-east Asia to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake part in competition and raising the standard\r\n\r\nof   sports,   is  also  meant  to  improve   the\r\n\r\nrelationship among the participating countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sponsor country recently sent a delegation\r\n\r\nhere  specially  to persuade our  authorities  to\r\n\r\nallow   our  volleyball  team,  basketball  team,\r\n\r\nfootball team and rugby team to take part in  the\r\n\r\nSEAP  Games. Yet its request was rejected.  Would\r\n\r\nit  affect the relationship between Singapore and\r\n\r\nThailand, especially in rugby? Rugby was proposed\r\n\r\nby our country to be added as an item in the SEAP\r\n\r\nGames  and yet we did not send any rugby team  to\r\n\r\ntake  part.  What  is past is past  but  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture, we can still do something to rectify  the\r\n\r\nsituation.

As\r\n\r\nfar  back  as  August last year, I warned  sports\r\n\r\norganisations  in  Singapore  that  unless   they\r\n\r\nreorganised  themselves  and  trained   hard   to\r\n\r\nachieve  the  standard required for inclusion  in\r\n\r\nour   contingent  taking  part  in  international\r\n\r\nsports meets, they would not be included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> You have not set any standard\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> We have set a minimum\r\n\r\nstandard for that. In the past, there was never a\r\n\r\nstandard set by the S.O.S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> On what criterion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Only a few\r\n\r\nsports  organisations took heed of that  warning.\r\n\r\nThe  rest did not care less. Even up to one month\r\n\r\nbefore   the  SEAP  Games,  the  National  Sports\r\n\r\nControl  Board  found that  a  number  of  sports\r\n\r\norganisations had not started training or had not\r\n\r\ntrained  seriously. The National  Sports  Control\r\n\r\nBoard  had decided on a certain required standard\r\n\r\nand  sports organisations which wanted to  be  in\r\n\r\ncluded  in  our  contingent  should  attain  that\r\n\r\nstandard. If they did not, then it was their  own\r\n\r\nfault.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us see what the basketball standard\r\n\r\nwas. In the record that I have here, the standard\r\n\r\nof volleyball was generally very low. In the last\r\n\r\nSEAP  Games  in Kuala Lumpur in 1965,  the  men's\r\n\r\nteam  was placed seventh out of seven teams which\r\n\r\ntook part. This means that they were the last  in\r\n\r\nthe  competition. Burma beat them 3 - 0.  Vietnam\r\n\r\nbeat  them  3  - 1. Cambodia beat  them  3  -  0.\r\n\r\nMalaysia beat them 3 - 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

There was no\r\n\r\nmanipulation. To charge the Board of bias or\r\n\r\nprejudice is most unworthy of the critics. Even\r\n\r\nthe organising council of the SEAP Games very\r\n\r\nsportingly accepted the decision of the Board\r\n\r\nafter I had explained to them the reasons why our\r\n\r\ncontingent was short of four teams.

Then it  went  to  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  which  received  representations   from\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public. Thereafter, it was brought\r\n\r\nback  to  Parliament  for Third  Reading  and  was\r\n\r\npassed  in August 1966. It was assented to by  the\r\n\r\nPresident in 1966.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now six years since this Bill was\r\n\r\nintroduced,  but up to today it has not  been  put\r\n\r\ninto  operation although it has been  passed.  The\r\n\r\nBill  provides for the setting up of  the  Majlis  us\r\n\r\nUgama islam, Sin gapura, and the appointments of a\r\n\r\nMufti  and a Secretary of the Mais. I  wish  to\r\n\r\nknow  whether  both these appointments  have  been\r\n\r\nfilled  and  whether the Majlis Ugama  islam,  Sin\r\n\r\ngapura, has been constituted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to a question I put to the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture  and  Social  Affairs  which  appears   in\r\n\r\nHansard,  Vol.  26,  No. 3, dated  8th  September,\r\n\r\n1967, at col.\r\n\r\n201,  as  to  whether there would be an additional\r\n\r\nKathi,  he  replied that a third  Kathi  would  be\r\n\r\nappointed, bringing the total number of Kathis  to\r\n\r\nthree.

For\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  formation of the Muslim  Religious\r\n\r\nCouncil  is  held  up because  we  cannot  find  a\r\n\r\nsuitable person to be the Chairman.

This  objective  is  being\r\n\r\nachieved,  and  the  commercial  service  of   the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Department collected  a  revenue  of\r\n\r\n$5.23  million in the first 11 months of  1967  in\r\n\r\ncomparison  with $4.53 million in the same  period\r\n\r\nof   1966  - an  increase  of  almost  $700,000.

In  the  case  of   T.V.\r\n\r\nMalaysia, there are less advertisements, which  is\r\n\r\nprobably  due  to  the fact that their  commercial\r\n\r\nservice cannot get the same amount of business  as\r\n\r\nT.V.

Singapura programmes and news. I\r\n\r\nfeel that there is an unfair distribution of news.\r\n\r\nFor example, some Members of Parliament appear  on\r\n\r\nT.V. when  they take part in celebrations,  while\r\n\r\nother  Members  do not appear on  T.V.  There  are\r\n\r\nothers who always appear on T.V. For example,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang always appears on T.V.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot know whether it is because ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it on a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nOn a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan is not\r\n\r\ngiving way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Is it\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Member for Sembawang always  praises\r\n\r\nthe Government that he appears on T.V.?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I raise this point not only\r\n\r\nfor myself but also for other Members. Whenever we\r\n\r\nhold  functions,  the leaders of  my  constituency\r\n\r\nspend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney  and  put in a lot of time and  effort.  But\r\n\r\nwhen we send for the T.V. crew, sometimes they  do\r\n\r\nnot  come.  And even when they do come, the  films\r\n\r\nthat they take do not appear on T.V. After all the\r\n\r\nefforts  put in by the leaders of my constituency,\r\n\r\nthere is nothing to show in return. Of course,  it\r\n\r\nis not because they always want to appear on T.V.,\r\n\r\nbut  we  should at least be fair to them  and  not\r\n\r\ndisappoint them. I hope the Minister will give  me\r\n\r\na satisfactory reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I must first clarify one point.\r\n\r\nThe  activities in Sembawang are not telecast very\r\n\r\noften.  Therefore, the Member for Delta had better\r\n\r\ngo there and make investigations before saying ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, Mr Teong. Perhaps the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary is  the  best  person  to\r\n\r\nreply to that criticism. Mr Fong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I really cannot understand\r\n\r\nthe  logic of some hon. Members. In spite of  what\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance said yesterday that news\r\n\r\ncoverage entails a lot of expenses and that  there\r\n\r\nis  wastage  of  public funds, hon. Members  still\r\n\r\nbring up this matter today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the policy is to provide an objective and\r\n\r\nintelligent coverage including local news, news of\r\n\r\nour  immediate  neighbours, and of  the  world  at\r\n\r\nlarge.  Usually,  local events  which  take  place\r\n\r\nbefore  six  p.m. are reported the  same  evening,\r\n\r\nwhereas foreign news usually comes in late and  is\r\n\r\nincluded in the following morning's programme. The\r\n\r\nDirector of Broadcasting normally decides  whether\r\n\r\nan  event is to be covered. His decision is  based\r\n\r\non  the  news-worthiness of the events in relation\r\n\r\nto  the  efforts required to cover  them  and  the\r\n\r\navailability of facilities. In this connection, he\r\n\r\nhas classified events into four categories:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) events which must be covered even if\r\n\r\nstringer cameramen have to be engaged;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) events which must be covered with the normal\r\n\r\nstaff;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) events which may be covered for the sake of\r\n\r\nvariety where facilities can be spared; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) events which should not be covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Normally, Ministers are given preference in\r\n\r\ncoverage, but this is not always the case. The\r\n\r\nDirector of Broadcasting sometimes gives\r\n\r\npreference to Members of Parliament if he\r\n\r\nconsiders that such coverage will give variety to\r\n\r\nthe news programmes and will eliminate monotony.\r\n\r\nFor example, community centre programmes are\r\n\r\nusually monotonous, more so if dinners are\r\n\r\ninvolved which so frequently take place in some\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than two and a half years, the News\r\n\r\nDivision has been run with only 60 per cent of the\r\n\r\napproved establishment and this is bound to affect\r\n\r\nthe quality of newsreels produced. For example,\r\n\r\nout of 11 very important posts of Epglish editors,\r\n\r\nonly 5 posts have been filled, while the rest have\r\n\r\nremained vacant due to the Public Service Com\r\n\r\nmission not being able to recruit suitable\r\n\r\ncandidates. And again for the posts of reporters,\r\n\r\nonly four are filled by experienced officers and\r\n\r\nsix by new recruits. There are still vacant posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are 12 reporters, they can work in\r\n\r\npairs to cover six local regions. At present, due\r\n\r\nto the shortage of experienced staff, it is\r\n\r\nextremely difficult to cover all events that take\r\n\r\nplace in Singapore. However, if advance notice is\r\n\r\ngiven, it can be arranged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to bring up one point, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, and that is we must give\r\n\r\nconsideration to the question of cost in the\r\n\r\ncoverage of news. I quote an example. For one\r\n\r\nminute of usable film material - raw film - the\r\n\r\ncost, including processing and printing, is $10.\r\n\r\nAnd the cost of employing stringers (if Members do\r\n\r\nunderstand this term) together with transport is\r\n\r\n$55. For the total expenditure of $65, 40 to 50\r\n\r\nseconds of news will appear for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevent. In other words, we spend $65 or more for\r\n\r\nperhaps 40 seconds' running on the T.V. screen. It\r\n\r\nis because of the high cost of employing stringer\r\n\r\ncameramen that we have to weigh the importance of\r\n\r\nthe news before such stringers are sent to cover\r\n\r\nthe event.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to supplement my answer\r\n\r\nfurther, since both Members appear to be very keen\r\n\r\non T.V. coverage. I will not quote any statistics,\r\n\r\nSir. The coverage for the Member for Delta in the\r\n\r\nlast 12 months is only one appearance short of\r\n\r\nthat for the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health. Next, for coverage of Members\r\n\r\nof Parliament, the Member for Sembawang came in\r\n\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, do you wish to say\r\n\r\nanything on this amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to say a few words. Regarding\r\n\r\nthe programmes on T.V, or over the radio, I feel\r\n\r\nthat the authorities have exercised fair judgment.\r\n\r\nThis is within their discretion, and I do not like\r\n\r\nto comment on it. But I would like to clarify that\r\n\r\nit is not because I praise the Government so much\r\n\r\nthat I had more appearances on T.V. In actual\r\n\r\nfact, I had very little chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I sympathise with what the\r\n\r\nMember for Delta has said. Very often I notice\r\n\r\nthat when she made up herself, she did not appear\r\n\r\non TV!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I feel\r\n\r\nthe Member for Bukit Merah perhaps might have\r\n\r\nswallowed something wrong. I think the Parlia\r\n\r\nmentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture was\r\n\r\nperhaps using this opportunity to give some other\r\n\r\nanswers, because he did not reply to the points I\r\n\r\nraised. When I raised them just now, I did not do so for\r\n\r\nmy own sake. I only said that the authorities\r\n\r\nshould be fair in their TV coverage of certain\r\n\r\nactivities in some other constituencies. So\r\n\r\nobviously certain matters have not been quite\r\n\r\nfairly treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At those times when I appeared on TV, it was\r\n\r\nbecause   the  Ministers  were  around,   and   so\r\n\r\nnaturally I also appeared. When I invited  the  TV\r\n\r\n\"kings\"  to come and get some plctures,  they  did\r\n\r\nnot  turn up. I am therefore not satisfied, and  I\r\n\r\nwould like to put my amendment to a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I appreciate the\r\n\r\ndilemma  you are in, Sir, with regard to the  time\r\n\r\nallotted  for the speakers, but maybe I could  add\r\n\r\njust one point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Second,  I must congratulate some  Members,\r\n\r\nparticularly the Member for Sembawang who makes it\r\n\r\na  point  to  be  present every time  there  is  a\r\n\r\nfunction  in  which a Minister is  there.

These  sets  are  meant   to   serve\r\n\r\nresidents  in  areas where social  amenities  are\r\n\r\nlimited.   It   should  also  be  stressed   that\r\n\r\ncommunity   listening  sets  can  serve   as   an\r\n\r\nimportant   medium  of  mass  communication   for\r\n\r\nresidents  in the rural areas during  periods  of\r\n\r\ntension and national emergency, though we do  not\r\n\r\nanticipate   any, ln   June   this   year,   on\r\n\r\ninstructions  from  the Ministry,  a  survey  was\r\n\r\ncarried  out as to the desirability of  retaining\r\n\r\nthese  sets at the various points. The result  of\r\n\r\nthe survey was that there appears to be a need to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  the  community listening sets.  But  in\r\n\r\nareas  where the people are poor and there is  no\r\n\r\nelectricity and they do not possess the  economic\r\n\r\nmeans  to purchase transistor radios, we  decided\r\n\r\nthat these sets should be allowed to continue  to\r\n\r\nbe   used  and  to  be  withdrawn  as  and   when\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the field section of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture  is in charge of these community listening\r\n\r\nsets  and the maintenance is by a contractor on  a\r\n\r\ntender basis, including even the tendering for the\r\n\r\nbatteries  to be supplied to those sets which  are\r\n\r\nbattery-operated.  I agree  and,  in  fact,  I  am\r\n\r\ngrateful to the Member for Changi for bringing  to\r\n\r\nmy  attention the delay in the maintenance. But  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to state that sometimes the delay  was\r\n\r\ndue  to  the non-availability of some spare  parts\r\n\r\nfor  those  sets, because, as Members know,  these\r\n\r\nsets are fairly old. But in most cases I think  it\r\n\r\nis  due  to the difficulty of transport in getting\r\n\r\nacross  the  islands. But I do  not  rule  out  al\r\n\r\ntogether  negligence on the part of the contractor\r\n\r\nin maintaining these sets, and I shall instruct my\r\n\r\nfield  section to be more vigilant and to  keep  a\r\n\r\ncloser watch on the contractor to see that he  dis\r\n\r\ncharges  his obligations as stated in the contract\r\n\r\nawarded to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In view of the\r\n\r\nexplanation given by the Parliamentary  Secretary,\r\n\r\nI beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1002\r\n\r\nbe reduced by $100*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The same amendment also stood in  the names of Mr Chow Chiok Hock and Madam Chan Choy Siong.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this head, I shall touch only on a\r\n\r\nfew  points.  The  first is the \"Eat  more  wheat\"\r\n\r\ncampaign  organised by the Broadcasting  Division.\r\n\r\nWhile  I congratulate Radio and T.V. Singapura  on\r\n\r\ntheir efforts in this campaign, I am disturbed  to\r\n\r\nnote  the  apparent ignorance on the part  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil servants in appreciating the thinking behind\r\n\r\nthe Government's intention in this matter. To whom\r\n\r\nare  we to beam this campaign? To the rich  or  to\r\n\r\nthe  poor?  I  have  seen film  shorts  and  heard\r\n\r\nannouncements on T.V. and over the radio.  Members\r\n\r\nwill  agree that the campaign seems to be directed\r\n\r\nat  the  rich who ironically are already consumers\r\n\r\nof wheat and who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  afford  to pay for rice at  ten  times  its\r\n\r\npresent price. In the last campaign listeners  and\r\n\r\nviewers were urged to participate in this campaign\r\n\r\nand  to submit a recipe, say, for breakfast  at  a\r\n\r\ncost  of not more than $3 for four persons. A  few\r\n\r\ndays  ago  I  heard the same announcement  of  the\r\n\r\nsecond  \"Eat  more  wheat\"  campaign.  This   time\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public are asked  to  prepare  a\r\n\r\nbreakfast  for  $2. You will agree with  me,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat we never spend that much money for breakfast.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, $3 or, for that matter, $2 is what  some\r\n\r\nworking family spend for the whole day's meals for\r\n\r\nthe family. I am not criticising the campaign. But\r\n\r\nI am not happy at the way it is being handled. For\r\n\r\ninstance,  pau. Do you know how much  we  have  to\r\n\r\nspend  on  the meat, chicken, prawns,  eggs,  etc.\r\n\r\nbefore  we  can make a pau? Do we really  have  to\r\n\r\nexhort  the  poor  people to save  more  money  by\r\n\r\neating  wheat and then mislead them into  spending\r\n\r\nseveral  times  more on meat?  Does  the  Minister\r\n\r\nsincerely believe that the poor people can  really\r\n\r\nafford this? Of course, if every citizen draws the\r\n\r\nsame salary as the Director of Broadcasting, we do\r\n\r\nnot need this campaign at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Madam Chan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I only\r\n\r\nwish  to ask about the campaign to eat more wheat.\r\n\r\nDo  the flour mills pay for the advertising  cost,\r\n\r\nbecause  this campaign is beneficial to the  flour\r\n\r\nmanufacturers?

However, up to now only a few creches  have\r\n\r\nbeen built.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the staff at these creches\r\n\r\nshould change their attitude. The reason is that I\r\n\r\nhave been told by many parents, whose children are\r\n\r\nin these creches, that the people in\r\n\r\ncharge are very proud and the treatment they  give\r\n\r\nto  the little children leaves much to be desired.\r\n\r\nThis  attitude is not suitable to our  custom  and\r\n\r\nenvironment, because what they learn is  from  the\r\n\r\nWestern  countries. Many of our  customs  are  not\r\n\r\npractised in these creches. As a result, from  the\r\n\r\nAsian  point of view, this causes a great deal  of\r\n\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  wish  the Minister can pay some attention  to\r\n\r\nthis  matter.

At\r\n\r\npresent,  we  have ten creches. I agree  with  her\r\n\r\nthat  we  should have more. The reason is that  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  lot  of workers in Singapore who  have  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of children. At home they cannot look\r\n\r\nafter the children properly. Therefore, they  have\r\n\r\nto  put  them  in  their relative's  house  or  in\r\n\r\ncreches  if  there are any. This will  bring  some\r\n\r\nconvenience to the families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta also wants to know whether\r\n\r\nit  is possible to build creches in the industrial\r\n\r\nsites.  If  there  are suitable  sites,  then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, our department will consider this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member claims that the attitude of the\r\n\r\npeople  in  charge  of  these  creches  and  their\r\n\r\neducational background are not suitable to our way\r\n\r\nof life. We are the first to oppose the problem of\r\n\r\nhaughtiness.  In  recruiting  the  staff  for  the\r\n\r\ncreches,  we subject them to a course of  courtesy\r\n\r\ntraining  to see if they are suitable in  handling\r\n\r\nchildren and their parents. However, perhaps there\r\n\r\nare  some  people in charge of these  creches  who\r\n\r\nmake  mistakes in their dealings with other people\r\n\r\nbecause  of the many problems they have to tackle.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Member for Delta can point out the people\r\n\r\nwho  are guilty in this respect, then I would like\r\n\r\nto  take steps to rectify this matter. Our country\r\n\r\ndoes not permit this sort of attitude.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Western habits or customs, I think there\r\n\r\nmay he some misunderstanding. As far as the people\r\n\r\nworking in these creches are concerned, out of ten\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  staff, about  five  are  Chinese\r\n\r\neducated.  There are 12 assistant instructors  who\r\n\r\nare  Chinese educated. As our country is a  multi-racial one, we\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuse  a  number of languages in these creches,  and\r\n\r\nthe   activities  in  these  creches  involve  the\r\n\r\ncustoms of other races. This is unavoidable. Since\r\n\r\nour  country is multi-racial, we carry out  multi-racial programmes in these creches. Similarly,  if\r\n\r\nthe Member for Delta has some good suggestions, we\r\n\r\nwill, of course, consider them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We all know that if  a  person\r\n\r\nis  not  really desperate and completely  helpless\r\n\r\nand  cannot go on living, he will not  go  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Assistance Section. Every  self-respecting\r\n\r\nperson  who goes to that section realises that  it\r\n\r\nis  a very humiliating experience. So unless he is\r\n\r\ncompletely  helpless, he will not take this  step.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result, he will register as a recipient  of\r\n\r\npublic  assistance if there is a need  for  it.  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  point  out  that  recipients  of  public\r\n\r\nassistance get more if some members in the  family\r\n\r\nhave T.B. If she is a\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nwidow with a few dependent children, then she gets\r\n\r\n$35 plus $5 for each child a month. So at the most\r\n\r\nshe gets about $50 or $60 a month. Under these circumstances, there is not enough to eat. Of course,\r\n\r\nthe  family will not die of starvation.  But  this\r\n\r\nsum is really not enough and, therefore, the widow\r\n\r\nwashes  clothes for other people in order to  earn\r\n\r\nabout $10 or $15 a month. But if the investigators\r\n\r\nin the Public Assistance Section find out that she\r\n\r\nwashes clothes for people, they will reduce or cut\r\n\r\noff  this  public assistance saying that  she  has\r\n\r\nalready found work. Actually what she gets is only\r\n\r\n$10  or  $15 a month for washing clothes.  Out  of\r\n\r\nthis  $15, she has to spend a few dollars on  soap\r\n\r\nand  other things. What she is left with  is  only\r\n\r\nvery  little. Actually it is doubtful whether  she\r\n\r\nhas  a  job or not. I think we should have a clear\r\n\r\ndefinition of what is work and what is not work. I\r\n\r\nthink  when a person earns about $15 a  month,  it\r\n\r\nshould  not  affect her chances of getting  public\r\n\r\nassistance. In fact, it is a good thing that  such\r\n\r\npeople do some work. Since they do not really  get\r\n\r\nenough  from  public assistance, the supplementary\r\n\r\nincome that they earn will come in very useful.  I\r\n\r\nthink   this   is   a   good  thing.   But   these\r\n\r\ninvestigators are too rigid in their  approach  to\r\n\r\nthis  problem and they just carry out their duties\r\n\r\ninflexibly.  As  a  result,  these  recipients  of\r\n\r\npublic assistance are adversely affected and  they\r\n\r\noften come and complain to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in my constituency this problem is\r\n\r\nvery  common. After the Bukit Ho Swee  fire,  many\r\n\r\nfamilies  did not have enough income and  many  of\r\n\r\nthem  were  jobless. So they had to  approach  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Assistance  Section for  relief.  But  the\r\n\r\nconditions  are  just as what I  have  said.  Very\r\n\r\noften  we  come across this problem.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\ninvestigators  in  the Public  Assistance  Section\r\n\r\nfrom   now   on   will  not  be  too   strict   or\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo rigid in their approach to this problem. If\r\n\r\nthey find out that these people have some sort of\r\n\r\nwork and if they have proof that they are earning\r\n\r\n$100 per month, then, of course, they can completely stop or reduce the assistance. But if the\r\n\r\nrecipients of public assistance only wash clothes\r\n\r\nand earn a bit of money. I do not think the Public\r\n\r\nAssistance Section should be too strict on them. I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister will give me a satisfactory\r\n\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir, just now I have already said that public\r\n\r\nassistance is given only to needy cases. When we\r\n\r\ndo so, we must take into consideration that the\r\n\r\napplicants are really poor and in actual need of\r\n\r\nthe assistance. There are some people who become\r\n\r\ndependent on public assistance if they are given a\r\n\r\nlarge sum and they do not want to go and look for\r\n\r\nwork to maintain themselves. These are the\r\n\r\nprinciples that the Public Assistance Section has\r\n\r\nto bear in mind. I agree with the Member for\r\n\r\nDelta. There have been such instances mentioned by\r\n\r\nthe Member not only in her constituency but also\r\n\r\nin other constituencies as well. We have found\r\n\r\nthat some of the members of the public that we\r\n\r\nmeet in our \"Meet the people sessions\" can\r\n\r\nactually work and the wages they receive are\r\n\r\nactually higher than what they have told us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in September, we reinvestigated 44\r\n\r\ncases and found that many of them were not true\r\n\r\nbecause they continued to receive public assist\r\n\r\nance even after being employed. If we did not re-investigate these cases, large sums of money would\r\n\r\nhave been paid out to these recipients of public\r\n\r\nassistance under false pretences. In November, 37\r\n\r\ncases were re-investigated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has said that\r\n\r\nwe should consider the cases of some poor people\r\n\r\nwho have to wash clothes in order to supplement\r\n\r\ntheir income. If these cases are true, of course,\r\n\r\nwe will consider them. But if after investigating,\r\n\r\nwe find that they are actually drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na higher income, we will reduce their public\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has also complained that the department\r\n\r\nconcerned has been too rigid in going about its\r\n\r\nbusiness.

In fact, the\r\n\r\npeople of Choa Chu Kang ask for water,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut they get trees instead! All these con\r\n\r\nstituencies are supposed to be semi-jungle and the\r\n\r\ntrees have not been properly planted. For example,\r\n\r\na small tree is planted about 1\ufffd yards away from a\r\n\r\nlamp-post. Within a year, the tree grows up and it\r\n\r\nengulfs the lamp-post or blocks out the light.\r\n\r\nWhat is worse is this. The Parks Division plants a\r\n\r\ntree today. But one week later, the P.W.D., on a\r\n\r\nprogramme of widening the roads, pull it out and\r\n\r\nthrow it away and carry on with their work. This\r\n\r\nwastage of money is, shall I say, unpardonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to pay serious\r\n\r\nattention to all these things and I hope that\r\n\r\nsteps will be taken to put them right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree very much\r\n\r\nwith what the Member for Changi has said. But I\r\n\r\nwould like to speak on the planting of flowers and\r\n\r\nplants and the building of small parks. I feel\r\n\r\nthat they should reflect an Eastern colour and\r\n\r\ntone in order that Singapore should be the garden\r\n\r\ncity of Asia. But at present, the small parks and\r\n\r\nthe planting of flowers, and so on, follow Western\r\n\r\nlines. So when tourists come here for a visit,\r\n\r\nthey do not enjoy the scenery as it will appear\r\n\r\ntoo westernised. So I feel that we must introduce\r\n\r\nan Eastern colour to the scenery. Singapore is in\r\n\r\nAsia and therefore we should put up things that\r\n\r\nare typical of this part of the world in order to\r\n\r\nattract more tourists. The Chief Parks Officer has\r\n\r\nlearnt a lot from the West and may have acquired a\r\n\r\nWestern outlook. Perhaps we can encourage him to\r\n\r\ngo to some Asian countries to acquire an artistic\r\n\r\ntaste so that he can add more Asian colour to our\r\n\r\ntrees and flowers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has also said that the\r\n\r\ntrees are planted haphazardly. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether this is an inheritance from the colonial\r\n\r\nera: more plants and flowers are planted in areas\r\n\r\nwhere there are more rich people staying. The\r\n\r\nflowers are very well planted and looked after at\r\n\r\nroad circuses or junctions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin areas where the rich people stay. But in areas\r\n\r\nwhere the poor people stay, the circuses are not\r\n\r\nplanted with beautiful flowers. Sir, this is not\r\n\r\nan exaggeration on my part. If we go round the\r\n\r\nisland, we can see for ourselves that better\r\n\r\nflowers are planted in areas occupied by the\r\n\r\nmiddle class than in areas occupied by the poor\r\n\r\npeople. For example, Delta Circus is in one such\r\n\r\narea occupied by the poor people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will direct his attention to\r\n\r\nthese matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b>\r\n\r\nSir, some time last year, while driving along\r\n\r\nCollyer Quay, one could see beautiful white boxes\r\n\r\nof flowers.

The Member\r\n\r\nfor Changi thinks that perhaps they might have\r\n\r\nwilted away. All these complaints are not correct.\r\n\r\nIn the past, the flowers planted in pots were\r\n\r\ngrown as an experiment. Now that the experiment\r\n\r\nhas proved successful, we realise that flowers can\r\n\r\nbe planted in pots and beds. But we also realise\r\n\r\nthat if flowers or trees are planted along the\r\n\r\ncentre of a road, many motorists will be\r\n\r\ninconvenienced as their vision will be affected\r\n\r\nand this might cause accidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has said that our flowers\r\n\r\nand trees should have more Eastern colour or tone.\r\n\r\nIt is really very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\ndifficult to distinguish between what is Eastern\r\n\r\nand what is Western. In fact, many of the trees\r\n\r\nand flowers that are planted are of Singapore\r\n\r\norigin. How can we say how many are from the\r\n\r\nBotanic Gardens or how many are from elsewhere?\r\n\r\nSir, we may know the origins of plants and\r\n\r\nseedlings, but I think it is very difficult to\r\n\r\ndistinguish between whether they are of Eastern or\r\n\r\nWestern origins.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the planting of more trees and flowers in\r\n\r\nareas occupied by rich people, I think there is\r\n\r\nsome misunderstanding. Many tourists coming here\r\n\r\nhave described Singapore as a green city with\r\n\r\nflowers and plants everywhere. In recent years, we\r\n\r\nhave planted innumerable trees and flowers. We did\r\n\r\nthis without taking into consideration whether an\r\n\r\narea is occupied by rich or poor people. Most hon.\r\n\r\nMembers, including myself, do not come from rich\r\n\r\nfamilies. We do not concentrate the planting of\r\n\r\ntrees and flowers only in areas occupied by rich\r\n\r\npeople and neglect those areas occupied by poor\r\n\r\npeople. This is not in accordance with our policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has complained that some\r\n\r\ntrees are planted near lamp-posts. I would like to\r\n\r\npoint out that thousands of plants are sometimes\r\n\r\nplanted at a time. As a result of development, the\r\n\r\nresidents of certain areas ask for lamp-posts to\r\n\r\nbe put up. But in the meantime, the plants have\r\n\r\ngrown into small trees. I think that is the actual\r\n\r\nsituation. I will be very glad if the hon. Member\r\n\r\ncan pin-point any such case and give me more\r\n\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has complained that in\r\n\r\ncertain areas we do not provide the people with\r\n\r\nwater but with trees. I should say that although\r\n\r\nwater is very important, trees are also important.\r\n\r\nOur lives would be monotonous without trees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has also said that at\r\n\r\ntimes the trees planted have to be removed due to\r\n\r\nroad widening. This is necessary because of road\r\n\r\nand other developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

And it is inevitable that in the course of\r\n\r\nour development in certain areas, the trees that\r\n\r\nhave already been planted might have to be\r\n\r\nremoved. In actual fact, many Members of\r\n\r\nParliament have helped our Ministry to carry out\r\n\r\ntree-planting campaigns. I remember in one\r\n\r\nconstituency the campaign has been very active. So\r\n\r\nit is not quite correct to bring this matter up in\r\n\r\nthis House. It would be better for us to go out\r\n\r\nand see for ourselves the lamp posts and trees. If\r\n\r\nthe Member for Changi can pin-point the particular\r\n\r\nincidents that have happened, we will, of course,\r\n\r\ngo there and investigate and put matters right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I think the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary has misunderstood what I\r\n\r\nhave said just now. I stated that today you plant\r\n\r\na tree and about a week later in the widening of\r\n\r\nthe road the P.W.D, move in and pull it out and\r\n\r\nchuck it away. There is no co-ordination between\r\n\r\nthe Parks Division and the P.W.D. If money is to\r\n\r\nbe spent in planting a tree and then pulling it\r\n\r\nout again for the purpose of widening the roads,\r\n\r\nwhat is the use of spending the money?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In places like Coronation Road, the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary can take a car and drive\r\n\r\ndown there immediately. In Swan Lake Avenue, where\r\n\r\nI live, you can see that the lamp posts in just\r\n\r\nabout three months are totally covered by the\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrees. That is what I have seen. The Member for\r\n\r\nThomson has informed me that the same thing\r\n\r\nhappens in Choa Chu Kang, and he can substantiate\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary can make this point very clear. I am not\r\n\r\nagainst such form of development, but I do not\r\n\r\nfeel that at this time we should make some\r\n\r\nsacrifice in the midst of development of our\r\n\r\ncountry, What I am against is the fact that trees\r\n\r\nplanted today are removed about a week later;\r\n\r\nthere must be some dislocation somewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak\r\n\r\non the reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nthat there is no difference between a rich man's\r\n\r\narea and a poor man's area. I think there is a\r\n\r\ndifference. Just look at Tanglin Road. Look at all\r\n\r\nthe trees and flowers planted there, and compare\r\n\r\nthem with the trees and flowers planted along\r\n\r\nBukit Ho Swee. They are not quite the same. The\r\n\r\nflowers in Tanglin are expensive, beautiful, and\r\n\r\nof a better type. I cannot describe them, but I\r\n\r\ncan at least see an aesthetic difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the trees and flowers in Tanglin,\r\n\r\nthere are also a few rocks and stones, piled up in\r\n\r\nthe shape of a man, and on top there is a little\r\n\r\nfountain. It is a beautiful thing. However, we in\r\n\r\nthe poor man's area do not get such things but\r\n\r\nonly a few trees with leaves, grass, and that is\r\n\r\nall-very poor types of flowers and plants. I think\r\n\r\nthe Minister himself should go there and have a\r\n\r\nlook. If I were a cameraman, I would take some\r\n\r\nphotographs and show them to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, if you look at this problem in\r\n\r\nterms of this area or that area, or in terms of\r\n\r\nconstituencies, it is not right. You should look\r\n\r\nat it from the point of view of Singapore as a\r\n\r\nwhole. We cannot have a national theatre in every\r\n\r\npart of Singapore. We cannot have in every\r\n\r\nconstituency a very good fountain. For example, in\r\n\r\nmy constituency,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere is the Jalan Besar Stadium. But\r\n\r\nit is very old and dilapidated. We should look at\r\n\r\nit from the point of view of the whole country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of principle, if the Government has\r\n\r\ndiscriminated against the poor man's areas in\r\n\r\nfavour of the rich man's areas, then this is\r\n\r\ndefinitely a mistake. But from the point of view\r\n\r\nof the whole of Singapore, if you want to beautify\r\n\r\nthe areas you cannot actually consider where this\r\n\r\ndevelopment should take place. Take, for example,\r\n\r\nThomson. In the past there were many attap huts\r\n\r\nthere, but now it is quite a beautiful area. There\r\n\r\nis a reservoir; there is a beautiful roundabout\r\n\r\nwith lots of flowers and plants; and there are\r\n\r\ntrees. All this was done by the Government. We do\r\n\r\nnot consider whether this is a poor man's area or\r\n\r\nnot, or that if it is a poor man's area, then we\r\n\r\nwill plant less there. There has never been such\r\n\r\nan idea from the beginning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. The Member for Changi has\r\n\r\npointed out the lack of co-ordination between the\r\n\r\nDepartments.\r\n\r\nI agree with him that in some instances\r\n\r\nit is so. But the situation is this. If we have to\r\n\r\nplant some thousands of trees, of course, we are\r\n\r\nliable to make some mistakes. We cannot be 100 per\r\n\r\ncent perfect in everything we do. This niistake\r\n\r\nhas occurred in two or three places only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In many places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nNow we have more than 10,000 trees planted.

Can the\r\n\r\nMinister inform this House whether there is a\r\n\r\ncontract of service for the post of the Director\r\n\r\nof the Botanic Gardens? And, if so, when is the\r\n\r\ncontract due to expire? Moreover, can the Minister\r\n\r\nalso enlighten us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether any of our local men of this calibre can\r\n\r\nbe found to substitute the expatriate officer when\r\n\r\nhis contract of service expires?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish to touch on the useful purposes\r\n\r\nof the Botanic Gardens. As far as I know, the\r\n\r\nBotanic Gardens is being used as a recreational\r\n\r\nground with its aesthetic virtues of beauty and\r\n\r\npeace, and it also keeps a herbarium of a good\r\n\r\ncollection of specimen plants with facilities\r\n\r\navailable to students from other countries to\r\n\r\nstudy and to do research work. What I wish to know\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister is that, in terms of public\r\n\r\nexpenditure, what benefit can Singapore derive\r\n\r\nfrom the results of the research?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that the knowledge of the research is\r\n\r\nuseful, cannot this work be undertaken by the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore and Nanyang University\r\n\r\nwhere there are Botany Departments doing similar\r\n\r\nresearch? is it, therefore, not possible for the\r\n\r\nBotanic Gardens to be placed under our own\r\n\r\ninstitutions of higher studies so that the\r\n\r\nknowledge from research studies of flora can be\r\n\r\nbest disseminated to students of botany?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there is now a dollar-earning industry\r\n\r\nin orchids which can bring extra income. The\r\n\r\ncultivation and research work in orchids are also\r\n\r\nbeing undertaken by the Botanic Gardens. In my\r\n\r\nopinion, this type of research work should be\r\n\r\nhanded over to the Primary Production Department\r\n\r\nwhich has scientists and research stations in Sem\r\n\r\nbawang and also has the facilities to train\r\n\r\nextension officers to teach the local farmers to\r\n\r\ngrow orchids on a commercial basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If orchid growing could be commercialised, it\r\n\r\nwould increase our export trade. To illustrate my\r\n\r\npoint, if rubber or Hevea Braziliensis is still\r\n\r\ntoday confined to the Botanic Gardens, there would\r\n\r\nbe no rubber industry today. Similarly, orchid\r\n\r\ngrowing and breeding should be widely\r\n\r\ncommercialised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope, Sir, that our Minister will\r\n\r\nconsider these matters.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, in reply to the hon. Member for Mountbatten,\r\n\r\n1 have to advise that the Director of the Botanic\r\n\r\nGardens is an expatriate officer on the permanent\r\n\r\nestablishment. Under the terms of Retirement from\r\n\r\nthe Public Service Compensation Ordinance, 1956,\r\n\r\nhe was offered a full career prospect till normal\r\n\r\nretirement. He will reach the age of 55 years in\r\n\r\nDecember 1969. I wish to add that the Director is\r\n\r\na biologist of international recognition. He is a\r\n\r\nmember of several international scientific\r\n\r\nsocieties. He is wholly dedicated to the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of the highest standard of research\r\n\r\nand the advancement of the international\r\n\r\nreputation of our Botanic Gardens and the position\r\n\r\nof public esteem and utility of our Republic. He\r\n\r\nhas not taken any Malayanisation compensation that\r\n\r\nwas optionally available to him under the\r\n\r\nRetirement from the Public Service Compensation\r\n\r\nOrdinance, unlike so many others who have done. He\r\n\r\nhas steered the Botanic Gardens through a very\r\n\r\ndifficult time of staff transition from expatriate\r\n\r\nto local officers in senior posts. As a result of\r\n\r\nthe overseas training he has arranged for the\r\n\r\nsenior staff, there is a highly qualified succession available on his retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional contact of the Botanic Gardens\r\n\r\nhas been expanded not only within the Republic but\r\n\r\nalso with botanical institutions in almost every\r\n\r\ncountry of the world. This is an aspect of the\r\n\r\nRepublic's international collaboration and is\r\n\r\ncontributory to our prestige and international\r\n\r\nimage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point of the motion, I have to\r\n\r\nstate that the Singapore herbarium holds the\r\n\r\nsecond largest collection of plant specimens in\r\n\r\nthe tropics. It is unique as a store-house of\r\n\r\nknowledge of the plant resources of South-east\r\n\r\nAsia. It provides an advisory and educational\r\n\r\nservice on plants and plant products. This service\r\n\r\nis made use of by innumerable local residents such\r\n\r\nas school children and school teachers, university\r\n\r\nundergraduates, post-graduates and lecturers,\r\n\r\ndoctors, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolice, businessmen and hundreds of members of the\r\n\r\ngeneral public, with an interest in plants. The\r\n\r\nmany overseas students who come to the Singapore\r\n\r\nherbarium do so because it has unrivalled\r\n\r\nfacilities for study but they only come under\r\n\r\nSingapore Government sponsorship. This is an\r\n\r\naspect of our Republic's contribution to regional\r\n\r\nmutual aid and developnient under the Colombo Plan\r\n\r\nand other international agreements. The acceptance\r\n\r\nof foreign students has never been to the\r\n\r\nexclusion of any local students. The transfer of\r\n\r\nthe herbarium to one of the universities in\r\n\r\nSingapore is impracticable on two grounds.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the living collection in the gardens and\r\n\r\nthe dry collectons in the herbarium are ipter-related and should not be separated, if they were\r\n\r\nseparated, both would lose their value. Secondly,\r\n\r\nthe Botanic Gardens, being a Government depart\r\n\r\nnient, directly serves the public. Both\r\n\r\nuniversities are exclusive bodies with\r\n\r\nresponsibility principally towards themselves and\r\n\r\nthe students. The public demand for the Botanic\r\n\r\nGardens service increases yearly, and with the\r\n\r\nregular rise in the standard of living this trend\r\n\r\nwill continue. A denial of this service by putting\r\n\r\nthe facilities out of public control would be\r\n\r\nindefensible. It is Government's policy to see\r\n\r\nthat this service is maintained by retaining the\r\n\r\nfacilities in a Government department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third point of the motion, it must be\r\n\r\npointed out that all the basic research into\r\n\r\norchid cultivation in Singapore was done by the\r\n\r\nBotanic Gardens. The first species collection was\r\n\r\nbegun a century ago and hybridising and laboratory\r\n\r\nculture have been carried on since 1928. It is\r\n\r\nthis work which has been the sole foundation for\r\n\r\nthe present day thriving of the orchid nursery\r\n\r\nindustry. Essentially in this aspect of their work\r\n\r\nthe Botanic Gardens are engaged on (1) the\r\n\r\nestablishment and expansion of the living\r\n\r\ncollection of orchid species, since it is only the\r\n\r\nnatural species that the first hybridising can be\r\n\r\ndone; (2) the introduction of exotic species, one\r\n\r\nreason for which the Botanic Gardens' worldwide\r\n\r\nconnections were developed; (3)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\nacclimatisation; (4) methods of cultivation; (5)\r\n\r\nhybridisation; and (6) selection. All these stages\r\n\r\nmust be gone through before desirable and\r\n\r\ncommercially exploitable strains can be produced.\r\n\r\nThis is basic research work which has a clearly\r\n\r\neconomic end and it is being carried out with\r\n\r\nincreasing tempo and success by the Botanic\r\n\r\nGardens. In this connection, the function of the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department is to assist the\r\n\r\nfarmers by the provision of materials for planting\r\n\r\non a large scale, not on a small scale, and with\r\n\r\nan advisory service. This is applied technology\r\n\r\nand not basic research, and it is a cashing in on\r\n\r\nthe pioneering done by the Botanic Gardens. This\r\n\r\nis a perfectly correct process. And there is no\r\n\r\noverlap by these two departments in their\r\n\r\nessential activities. In this connection, the\r\n\r\nBotanic Gardens undertakes identification,\r\n\r\ndescription of new species and new hybrids in\r\n\r\naccordance with the requirements of the\r\n\r\ninternational code of nomenclature and the\r\n\r\nregistration of new hybrid names with the\r\n\r\ninternational registration authority. This is both\r\n\r\nan essential part of the Botanic Gardens research\r\n\r\nprocedure and public service. Since it is freely\r\n\r\navailable to and constantly used by the public and\r\n\r\norchid nurseries, the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment employs no botanist or horticulturist\r\n\r\nand it has neither expertise nor experience to do\r\n\r\nthese things. Since there is no overlap of\r\n\r\nfunctions and there would be a definite loss of\r\n\r\nresearch efficiency and the loss of public\r\n\r\namenities by transferring the Botanic Gardens\r\n\r\norchid research to the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment, there is no intention to alter the\r\n\r\npresent existing arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second and third points raised by the hon.\r\n\r\nMember seem to me to iniply a lack of\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the importance of the Singapore\r\n\r\nBotanic Gardens. I wish to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto state that the activities are directed towards\r\n\r\nmeeting the demands of the public in the following\r\n\r\nservice:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) by a botanical service, educational or research;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) by a horticultural service, educational or research;\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) by a skilled supply of advisory service; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) by the provision of recreational grounds of a higher status than that of an ordinary park in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the Botanic Gardens be split, the\r\n\r\nherbarium to one of the universities, and\r\n\r\nhorticultural research to the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment, or the functions materially change,\r\n\r\nthen these four avenues of service which the\r\n\r\npublic at present enjoy would cease to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\nquite satisfied with the answer given by\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary. First of all, he has not\r\n\r\nanswered my first point. That is, whether we can\r\n\r\nget a man of suitable calibre to take over from\r\n\r\nthe Director since his services are about to\r\n\r\nexpire in 1969. The second point is, for the\r\n\r\nmoment, I am not saying that the herbarium should\r\n\r\nbe separated from the Botanic Gardens. I say that\r\n\r\nthe herbarium itself inside the Botanic Gardens\r\n\r\nshould be placed at the disposal of the university\r\n\r\nwhich has a Department of Botany so that students\r\n\r\ncan study it. At the present moment, very few\r\n\r\npeople are making use of this herbarium, let alone\r\n\r\nthose people going down to the park to enjoy the\r\n\r\nquiet atmosphere. Those are park goers. I also go\r\n\r\nto the park and enjoy looking at the life plant,\r\n\r\nas the Parliamentary Secretary has said. But, on\r\n\r\nthe other hand, who is interested in the\r\n\r\nherbarium? How many people are making use of it?\r\n\r\nThe point is this. I am only suggesting that this\r\n\r\nherbarium should be placed at the disposal of the\r\n\r\nuniversity so that students will benefit from the\r\n\r\nresearch. That is all I want to clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> I have answered his\r\n\r\nquestions very well, Sir.

I merely like to ask the Minister for\r\n\r\nLaw and National Development why many areas of\r\n\r\nCrown land are still vacant and not put to any\r\n\r\nuse. The residents in these areas are badly in\r\n\r\nneed of these pieces of land. But the Government\r\n\r\nwants to requisition such pieces of land. It seems\r\n\r\nto be quite contrary to the desire of the people\r\n\r\nand also it is not quite proper because there are\r\n\r\nso many pieces of vacant land the Government can\r\n\r\nmake use of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we\r\n\r\nall know that the P.A.P. Government is a clean, honest and effective\r\n\r\ngovernment. We have been elected by the people to\r\n\r\nrun the government because of our qualities which\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned. But I understand there\r\n\r\nare still many cases in the Land Office on which\r\n\r\ndecision has been pending for quite a long time.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in my constituency there is a\r\n\r\nresident who has a piece of private land. He wants\r\n\r\nto exchange it for Crown land with the Government.\r\n\r\nBut the matter has been delayed for two years\r\n\r\nwithout any reply given to him. There are also\r\n\r\ncases where people apply to rebuild their houses\r\n\r\nbut consideration of their applications has also\r\n\r\nbeen delayed for a very long time. Where is the\r\n\r\nefficiency we are talking about? I would like to\r\n\r\nknow whether the Land Office are under-staffed. Or\r\n\r\nperhaps they are deliberately delaying their work\r\n\r\nin order to get some benefit out of certain\r\n\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about unlawful :structures.\r\n\r\nWe know that the general standard of education of\r\n\r\nthe people in the rural areas is low and they do\r\n\r\nnot quite understand or realise Government's\r\n\r\npolicies or administration. When they find that\r\n\r\nthe roofs of their houses leak, they will repair\r\n\r\nthem themselves, if the inspectors of the Land\r\n\r\nOffice find this out, the persons concerned will\r\n\r\nbe ordered to dismantle what they have done, or\r\n\r\nelse a fine will be imposed on them. We know that\r\n\r\nthe rural people have been struggling hard to make\r\n\r\na living out of the land and have spent their hard-earned money on repairing their houses. So if you\r\n\r\nask them to dismantle or demolish what they have\r\n\r\nalready repaired, it would cause them a great\r\n\r\nloss. Why are the inspectors not required to give\r\n\r\nthem notices in advance? Only when adequate\r\n\r\nnotices have been given can the inspectors fine\r\n\r\nthe offenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is about complaints made by the\r\n\r\nrural people against land inspectors who very\r\n\r\noften come in close contact with the rural people.\r\n\r\nVery often they lack courtesy. In my constituency,\r\n\r\nI have received several complaints against the\r\n\r\nattitude of land inspectors. I hope the Minister\r\n\r\ncan give me a satisfactory reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir, the Land Office is in charge of Crown land in\r\n\r\nthe State. This is an important task, no doubt. In\r\n\r\nthe rural areas there are also pieces of Crown\r\n\r\nland. The Government has already made its plan in\r\n\r\nregard to these areas of land. Some pieces of land\r\n\r\nare meant for future development. Some marshy\r\n\r\nlands are not meant for any use. I remember last\r\n\r\nyear I had occasion to raise this question,\r\n\r\nnamely, the department concerned should realise\r\n\r\nthat Singapore is developing. So the situation is\r\n\r\nentirely different from what was obtained 10 or 15\r\n\r\nyears ago. Singapore's Master Plan will be\r\n\r\nreviewed every five years. Whenever there is a\r\n\r\nreview, changes will be made to it.

We are also facing the same problems. There\r\n\r\nare many cases of residents applying for public\r\n\r\nutility services such as the supply of\r\n\r\nelectricity, water, house numbers and so on, but\r\n\r\nwithout getting replies to their requests. I hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister can give us a satisfactory reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> First, may I deal with the\r\n\r\nMember for Delta? Somehow I have a feeling that\r\n\r\nshe did not really have much to say. She was\r\n\r\nmerely moving an amendment in her name to give\r\n\r\nother Back-benchers an opportunity to say what\r\n\r\nthey wanted to. She said that we were acquiring\r\n\r\nvacant pieces of land and yet there were many\r\n\r\npieces of land not occupied in Singapore which\r\n\r\nbelong to the Government. This must be as it is.\r\n\r\nCertain lands are reserved for future development,\r\n\r\nand on some, development is not even allowed,\r\n\r\nmaybe because it is agricultural land or a green\r\n\r\nbelt. We cannot have buildings on every acre of\r\n\r\nland in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may come to the Member for Jurong. He\r\n\r\nreferred to an honest P.A.P. Government and said\r\n\r\nthat there were many cases pending. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhat cases he is referring to. But he mentioned\r\n\r\none in particular about a resident who desired to\r\n\r\nexchange his piece of land with Crown land. Well,\r\n\r\nit is not the usual practice of Government to\r\n\r\nexchange Crown land for private pieces of land.\r\n\r\nBut we sometimes do this to accommodate the\r\n\r\nprivate owner. He said that this particular case\r\n\r\nhas been pending for two years, and he thought\r\n\r\nthat delay might mean corruption. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I said many a time in this House that making\r\n\r\ngeneral allegations of corruption in this House\r\n\r\ngets us nowhere. If you have a specific complaint,\r\n\r\nmake it and the C.P.I.B. will investigate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also referred to many other cases of owners\r\n\r\nwishing to rebuild their houses and referred to\r\n\r\ndelay. According to him, this delay was purposely\r\n\r\nimposed so that perhaps the staff of the Land\r\n\r\nOffice could get some benefit. Here again if he\r\n\r\nhas any specific instances, let my Ministry know.\r\n\r\nWe can investigate. He referred not only to the\r\n\r\nrebuilding of houses but repairs of buildings and\r\n\r\n1 assume, as we are discussing Head 1105 - Land\r\n\r\nOffice - that he refers to structures on State\r\n\r\nland; otherwise he would be out of order. When\r\n\r\nState land is occupied, it is usually occupied on\r\n\r\nwhat is called a temporary occupation licence for\r\n\r\nwhich a fee is payable and for which certain\r\n\r\nconditions are laid down. If the licensee desires\r\n\r\nto repair his house or to extend it, then he has\r\n\r\nto get the pernhission of the owner, the Land\r\n\r\nOffice. We are not against poor tenants or poor\r\n\r\nlicensees rebuilding or repairing their houses.\r\n\r\nBut licensees are usually compensated when they\r\n\r\nare ejected, and the bigger the house, the greater\r\n\r\nthe compensation. It is for this reason that these\r\n\r\nconditions are imposed so that the Land Office\r\n\r\nknows what is happening to the particular piece of\r\n\r\nland which is let out on licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more serious allegation by the Member for\r\n\r\nJurong is that no notices are given when officers\r\n\r\nof the Land Office move in to demolish buildings\r\n\r\nand that there is a lack of courtesy on the part\r\n\r\nof land officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Minister has misunderstood what I\r\n\r\nsaid.

What I actually meant was that as the\r\n\r\ngeneral education of the population in the rural\r\n\r\nareas is of a low standard, they are not very\r\n\r\nconversant with Government procedure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelating to applications for structural changes to\r\n\r\ntheir houses. When such structural changes have\r\n\r\nbeen made and are discovered by the land officers,\r\n\r\nthe occupants are fined, although they may have\r\n\r\nreceived notices pertaining to their applications.\r\n\r\nWhat I really want to know is, why cannot the Land\r\n\r\nOffice send out more inspectors to enlighten the\r\n\r\nrural people on the procedure to be followed\r\n\r\nbefore making any structural changes to their\r\n\r\nhouses? If the Ministry can do this, the rural\r\n\r\npeople will not suffer financially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad at least\r\n\r\nthat the Member has clarified this and made it\r\n\r\nclear that the Land Office does not demolish\r\n\r\nstructures without adequate notices, in fact, many\r\n\r\nan application for extension is given provided the\r\n\r\ncircumstances warrant it. But to plead ignorance\r\n\r\non the part of rural dwellers is, I think, not the\r\n\r\nbasic cause. Anyone who is a licensee of\r\n\r\nGovernment land is issued with a piece of paper\r\n\r\ncalled a \"Temporary Occupation Licence\" and on\r\n\r\nthis licence are recorded the terms and\r\n\r\nconditions. Surely, however ignorant a licensee\r\n\r\nmay be, he can enquire from the Land Office when\r\n\r\nhe gets his licence as to what these conditions\r\n\r\nmean, or he can enquire from the Member for Jurong\r\n\r\nas to what these terms mean. But it is usual in\r\n\r\nSingapore for anyone who breaches the law to plead\r\n\r\nignorance. So many pieces of land are let out on\r\n\r\nT.O.L.s. So many unauthorised houses are built.\r\n\r\nThe usual answer is ignorance. The sending out of\r\n\r\nland officers to educate the rural folks is not,\r\n\r\nin my view, the answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may deal with the Member for Sembawang, he\r\n\r\nmade a rather general statement that the Land\r\n\r\nOffice should realise that Singapore is\r\n\r\ndeveloping. I can assure him that we do realise\r\n\r\nthat Singapore is developing. He talked about\r\n\r\nelectricity and house numbers. Electricity is a\r\n\r\nmatter for the P.U.B. and the allocation of house\r\n\r\nnumbers is a matter for the Property Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment.

At the\r\n\r\nmoment, it has been raining so heavily in\r\n\r\nSingapore and South Johore that we are in the\r\n\r\nhappy position of having all our reservoirs in\r\n\r\nJohore full to the brim, and in Singapore, both\r\n\r\nMacRitchie and Peirce Reservoirs have about 90 per\r\n\r\ncent of water capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have decided to cut down the number of\r\n\r\nstandpipes - not to take water away from the\r\n\r\npopulation, but to remove the standpipes and\r\n\r\ninstead supply water direct to houses. So that if\r\n\r\nin the future - this is a big \"if\" - we have to impose water rationing, there will\r\n\r\nbe less confusion at stand-pipes and it will be\r\n\r\neasier to impose a fair method of water rationing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is right when he says\r\n\r\nthat 150 standpipes have been removed this year.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the correct figure is 154. But before action is taken to remove public\r\n\r\nstandpipes, circulars are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissued by the Secretary of the Urban and Rural\r\n\r\nServices Committee informing Members of\r\n\r\nParliament, and through them the Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committees of various constituencies,\r\n\r\nthat certain standpipes will have to be removed.\r\n\r\nThe circular points out that representations\r\n\r\nshould be made to the ad hoc committee which is\r\n\r\nlooking after this matter, that these\r\n\r\nrepresentations will be considered, and that no\r\n\r\nstand-pipes will be removed until further notice\r\n\r\nis given to the effect that any representation has\r\n\r\nbeen accepted or rejected. But I can assure the\r\n\r\nhon. Member for Changi that the policy is to\r\n\r\nremove a standpipe only if it serves very few\r\n\r\npeople or, if it serves many people, not to remove\r\n\r\nit until these people have alternative supplies of\r\n\r\nwater. If any standpipe has been removed without a\r\n\r\nnotice, or removed after a notice had been served\r\n\r\nand representations made, then the standpipe was\r\n\r\nremoved by mistake. And all the M.P. has to do is\r\n\r\nto point out that mistake and the standpipe will\r\n\r\nbe restored. It is quite easy to seal and then\r\n\r\nunseal a standpipe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I end, the Member may he interested\r\n\r\nto know that I am not in charge of standpipes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nwould like the Minister to elaborate further.

Actually at the moment we can see very\r\n\r\nclearly that Singapore has many tall buildings and\r\n\r\nwe are continuing to build blocks of tall\r\n\r\nbuildings. This goes to show that the Singapore\r\n\r\nQovernment is achieving a great deal. It also goes\r\n\r\nto show that the Ministry of National Development\r\n\r\nhas achieved great success in this direction. Not\r\n\r\none of us can criticise what has been going\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have a few questions which perhaps\r\n\r\nhave been neglected. When we want to carry out\r\n\r\nurban renewal, we have to resettle the people\r\n\r\naffected, and this problem of resettlement has\r\n\r\nbeen solved quite successfully and satisfactorily\r\n\r\nin the past. As a rule, most people are quite\r\n\r\nsatisfied. However, in the last year or so this\r\n\r\nmatter has been neglected. I do not know what is\r\n\r\nthe reason for this neglect, and whether the\r\n\r\nMinister is aware of the causes. I do not think I\r\n\r\nneed to point it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the officials in charge of resettlement\r\n\r\nhave a different attitude nowadays. They seem to\r\n\r\ntreat the people affected in a very harsh and\r\n\r\ndemanding way. They just tell them to move out and\r\n\r\nto resettle. They give them a period\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof one month or so to move, and these people have\r\n\r\nto move away. Usually the people would like to\r\n\r\nhave suitable alternative accommodation, but these\r\n\r\nresettlement officials usually cast aside their\r\n\r\ncomplaints and carry out their course of action.\r\n\r\nOf course, sometimes the people are wrong to\r\n\r\ncomplain, but sometimes their grievances are\r\n\r\nlegitimate. However, the officials do not consider \r\n\r\ntheir grievances. What happens is this, in\r\n\r\nthe old days we used to have an Opposition Party.\r\n\r\nHowever, now we are all in the same Party. Those\r\n\r\nMembers sitting opposite are all in our Party.\r\n\r\nPerhaps because of this, the resettlement officers\r\n\r\nare not afraid to carry out any harsh measures.\r\n\r\nAnd because of this, our Government has received a\r\n\r\ngreat deal of unnecessary criticism. Of course,\r\n\r\nthe aim of the Government is good. It is to\r\n\r\nprovide accommodation for them. But unfortunately\r\n\r\nthe attitude of the officials in charge has given\r\n\r\nrise to a lot of criticism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that in the course of\r\n\r\nresettlement the people incur a loss. It is like\r\n\r\nthis. There are two different conditions of\r\n\r\nresettlement. First, when Government requisitions\r\n\r\na piece of land, the people who live on it have,\r\n\r\naccording to the time given to them in the notice,\r\n\r\nto leave and go elsewhere. Second, suppose the\r\n\r\nland belongs to the Housing Board and suppose at\r\n\r\nthe time of the construction of the new buildings\r\n\r\nthey find that a lot of houses have been built on\r\n\r\nit, as a result of which a lot of land is taken\r\n\r\nup, and they find it is necessary to demolish\r\n\r\nthese buildings. Of course, if we want to demolish\r\n\r\nthese buildings, we have to move the people away\r\n\r\nand to resettle them elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is this: if the people who are\r\n\r\nresettled were to live in Housing Board flats,\r\n\r\nthey would pay a very low rent at present, and\r\n\r\ncommunications and transport are usually very\r\n\r\nconvenient. So in this respect their expenditure\r\n\r\nhas been reduced correspondingly. But if we\r\n\r\ndemolish these houses and resettle the people\r\n\r\nelsewhere - we probably\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\nwould put them somewhere far away and farther than\r\n\r\ntheir present places\r\n\r\n-  then as a result they would have to pay more\r\n\r\nfor their transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is rent. If we resettle them, the\r\n\r\nnew rent will be higher than the present rent. For\r\n\r\nexample, if the present rent is $40 for two rooms\r\n\r\nand one hall, then in the new place which has one\r\n\r\nhall and one room, the rent is $46. So this\r\n\r\nunavoidably brings about a greater burden on these\r\n\r\npeople. The difference in the rent is $20 or more,\r\n\r\nand the burden is correspondingly higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the problem of removal. When these\r\n\r\npeople move out, they have to get a lorry with two\r\n\r\nor three labourers to carry the furniture. But the\r\n\r\nHousing Board does not seem to think it necessary\r\n\r\nto give them any allowance for removal expenses.\r\n\r\nThey do not consider it at all necessary to grant\r\n\r\nthem any allowance for removal. I think this is\r\n\r\nmost improper. I think this is a great burden on\r\n\r\nthem, as on removal they have to spend more money.\r\n\r\nIf we do not consider these points and continue to\r\n\r\nneglect these problems and let the people just\r\n\r\nsuffer in silence, then the problem will be\r\n\r\naggravated as time goes by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now about the land which is required by the\r\n\r\nGovernment for development. We all know that many\r\n\r\nshops in Chinatown pay very low rents and, as a re\r\n\r\nsult, their businesses can carry on. But as a\r\n\r\nresult of resettlement, these people are moved to\r\n\r\nflats or shops which are built by the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard. Of course, this is good. The new flats are\r\n\r\nquite pretty and well constructed. But their rent\r\n\r\nis about four times the rent paid by these shops\r\n\r\nin Chinatown. The Housing Board rent would be\r\n\r\nabout $400. This is about four times higher than\r\n\r\nthe old rent, which is about $100. Moreover, in\r\n\r\nthe new environment, whether the business will be\r\n\r\nas good as before remains to be seen. In many\r\n\r\ninstances   -    there are some in my constituency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-    the problem of resettlement is a very serious\r\n\r\none. Many businessmen in my constituency have\r\n\r\ncomplained to me that after moving in to their new\r\n\r\nplace, it will take them a few years before their\r\n\r\nbusiness can pick up and reach the level of their\r\n\r\nformer business. I hope the Minister will consider\r\n\r\nthe points I have raised. The people who are being\r\n\r\nresettled should be given some sort of\r\n\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as far as the shops are con-cerned,\r\n\r\nthey should be given some subsidy for the rent. Of\r\n\r\ncourse, this subsidy does exist now, but it is not\r\n\r\ngiven to everybody. The system is by tender. If\r\n\r\nthe tender is for $800, then the shop' will have\r\n\r\nto pay $800. Three years' concession is given. If\r\n\r\nthe basic value of this building is $400, they\r\n\r\nhave to pay $400 in the first year. In the second\r\n\r\nyear, they have to pay 50 per cent of the tender\r\n\r\nvalue, which is $600. In the third year they have\r\n\r\nto pay $800. As far as the small businessmen are\r\n\r\nconcerned, this is a heavy blow. I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister will pay attention to this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I know that the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment is in charge of many matters. It is in\r\n\r\ncharge, for example, of the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment, Urban and Rural Services, Car Parks\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tasks, which are in the interest of our\r\n\r\neconomy, have been carried out very efficiently.\r\n\r\nBut as far as the Primary Production Department is\r\n\r\nconcerned, there are some aspects to which proper\r\n\r\nattention has not been given. For example, last\r\n\r\nyear, there were two outbreaks of swine fever.\r\n\r\nThis not only caused a great loss to the farmers\r\n\r\nbut also reduced the consumption of pork by the\r\n\r\npeople. This is due to the neglect of the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department. I hope the authorities will\r\n\r\npay more attention to this matter. The Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department should look after the\r\n\r\ninterests of the farmers,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether they are rearing pigs, chickens, goats,\r\n\r\ncattle, ducks or other animals. They should plan\r\n\r\nbeforehand and take preventive measures so that our\r\n\r\nfarmers will not suffer further financial losses.\r\n\r\nAnother point is that the officers in the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department should explain to the farmers\r\n\r\nthe desirability of their services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as car parks are concerned, a\r\n\r\nproblem remains to be solved. We know that the\r\n\r\nconstruction of car parks has three objectives.\r\n\r\nFirst, to create more employment opportunities for\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nSecond, to increase revenue for Government. Third.\r\n\r\nto improve the traffic system. These objectives are\r\n\r\nsound. However, the Department is building car-parking spaces almost everywhere. This has caused a\r\n\r\ngreat deal of inconvenience to the people. For\r\n\r\nexample, the business of the shop-keepers has been\r\n\r\naffected. Taxi drivers have complained that their\r\n\r\nformer taxi stands have been converted into car-parking spaces. This has caused some inconvenience\r\n\r\nto them. Therefore. I hope when the relevant\r\n\r\ndepartments are drawing up lots for parking, they\r\n\r\nwill consider the businesses around those places.\r\n\r\nThey should also consider the welfare of the taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers. All these people pay taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\nconsider and which I hope he will not misunderstand\r\n\r\nme is this. Arab Street is usually the place where\r\n\r\nI catch my taxi to go to Sembawang. The taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers there have complained to me that there are\r\n\r\nno taxi stands in Arab Street and they are often\r\n\r\nbooked by traffic policemen. At one time the Taxi\r\n\r\nDrivers' Association made a request to have a taxi\r\n\r\nstand in Arab Street, but the relevant department\r\n\r\nsaid that the streets were too narrow and not\r\n\r\nsuitable for the construction of taxi stands.\r\n\r\nTherefore, their request was turned down. Not long\r\n\r\nafter that, car-parking lots were drawn up at the\r\n\r\nsame spot for the use of private cars. If private\r\n\r\ncars can be parked there, taxis can also be parked\r\n\r\nthere. However, when the policemen see the taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers parking there, they will charge them for\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparking their cars there. Is this not inconsistent?\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister will explain to me this\r\n\r\ncontradiction. If he wishes to shift the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the Ministry of Defence, I hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister of Defence will give a satisfactory\r\n\r\nanswer because his Ministry is in charge of traffic\r\n\r\npolicemen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to urban and rural services, I have\r\n\r\nnothing but praise. But sometimes there has been\r\n\r\ndelay in carrying out certain projects. I suggest\r\n\r\nthat we should have a supervisory projects\r\n\r\ncommittee with two objectives. First, to increase\r\n\r\nthe speed in carrying out the projects. Second, to\r\n\r\nsupervise the contractors in carrying out the work\r\n\r\nin order to prevent any malpractices on the part of\r\n\r\nthe contractors. What the Member for Delta has\r\n\r\nraised just now is very correct. We often receive a\r\n\r\nlot of complaints. I admit that our Minister is a\r\n\r\ncapable and upright man. Maybe he does not have the\r\n\r\ntime to hear, the complaints that we receive. So I\r\n\r\nwould like the relevant department to take note of\r\n\r\nthis problem. I personally know that some shop-keepers have been evicted and have great difficulty\r\n\r\nin finding alternative location. The department\r\n\r\ntells them that they cannot find other\r\n\r\naccommodation for them because other shop-keepers\r\n\r\nhave been given accommodation. At the same time,\r\n\r\nthe Land Office will go on collecting rent from\r\n\r\nthem. How can the small businessmen maintain their\r\n\r\nlivelihood when the Land Office continues to\r\n\r\ncollect rent from them? I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\nconsider all these points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I have only one point to bring to\r\n\r\nthe notice of the Minister. I was told that the\r\n\r\nnumber -of pigs slaughtered at the new Jurong\r\n\r\ncentral abattoir is not satisfactory. For example,\r\n\r\nI understand that in one hour at the present\r\n\r\nabattoir in French Road they slaughter about 100\r\n\r\npigs, whereas at Jurong they only slaughter about\r\n\r\nten for the same length of time. If this is true,\r\n\r\nwill the Minister make a statement and, at the same\r\n\r\ntime, consider changing the mechanised system into\r\n\r\na manual system as at present?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir, I have a point to ask the Minister. In his\r\n\r\nanswer to the previous question, he said that it\r\n\r\nwas a good thing that it rained, because our\r\n\r\nreservoirs are now full. But when it rains,\r\n\r\ncertain things happen. For the past few days we\r\n\r\nhave seen that after a heavy rain many places have\r\n\r\nbeen flooded, whether in the rural or city area,\r\n\r\nand also in the new housing estates. For example,\r\n\r\nin Queenstown Estate, whenever it rains, the\r\n\r\nQueensway Circus is flooded. We know that the\r\n\r\nflood water causes a lot of inconvenience to the\r\n\r\npeople. This is especially so -after classes when\r\n\r\nthe students find it difficult to go home. At the\r\n\r\nsame time, we see that the places which have been\r\n\r\nflooded are the scenes of many obstructions. After\r\n\r\neach flood the Government will lose a lot of money\r\n\r\nin repairing -roads which have been damaged by the\r\n\r\nfloods. I wish to ask whether the Minister has an\r\n\r\nisland-wide anti-flood project in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I have a complaint about\r\n\r\nthe abattoir, a complaint similar to that of the\r\n\r\nMember for Aljunied. I am told that the modern\r\n\r\nabattoir at Jurong is not designed for locally-reared pigs, and that Ihere are some defects\r\n\r\nsomewhere in the system itself. I am not well\r\n\r\nversed in machinery and therefore cannot describe\r\n\r\nthe defects.\r\n\r\nThe device - I use the word \"device\"\r\n\r\n-    in the abattoir is not big enough for our\r\n\r\npigs to go in. It is too small for our local pigs\r\n\r\nto he slaughtered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the abattoir has been installed\r\n\r\non a Danish design. Whether it is right or wrong,\r\n\r\nI stand to be corrected. Nevertheless, I wish to\r\n\r\nknow from the Minister what action he proposes to\r\n\r\ntake to rectify the defects in the abattoir.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the capital expenditure on this abattoir\r\n\r\nis a wastage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if I can deal with the question\r\n\r\nof the abattoir', according to the Member for\r\n\r\nAljunied, the number of pigs that can be\r\n\r\nslaughtered at the abattoir at French Road is 100\r\n\r\npigs an hour.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

And you\r\n\r\ngive me the credit of knowing the difference\r\n\r\nbetween the ahattoir at French Road and the\r\n\r\nabattoir at Jurong. I am not conversant with the\r\n\r\nfacts that both Members allege. In fact, as far as\r\n\r\nI am aware, before the swine fever epidemic. 3,000\r\n\r\npigs a day were being slaughtered. Assuming the\r\n\r\nMember for Aljunied's figures are correct, 100\r\n\r\npigs per hour working 24 hours =\r\n\r\n2,400 pigs. This is still less than the number of\r\n\r\npigs slaughtered before. But after the swine fever\r\n\r\nepidemic had started and after rumours about\r\n\r\neating vaccinated pork went round Singapore,\r\n\r\npeople were afraid to consume pork and the number\r\n\r\nof pigs slaughtered dropped from 3,000 to 100. No\r\n\r\npigs were slaughtered, not because the abattoirs\r\n\r\nhad not the means, hut because butchers could not\r\n\r\nsell their pork and farmers were not interested in\r\n\r\nhaving their pigs slaughtered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock):</b>\r\n\r\nIf the Minister will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If I have finished with\r\n\r\nthe Member for Mountbatten on the question of\r\n\r\npigs, I am prepared to give way for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten alleges that the\r\n\r\nDanish design of the abattoir does not suit local\r\n\r\npigs.

The\r\n\r\nMember for Aljunied says that he only got this\r\n\r\ninformation two days ago. I have not even heard\r\n\r\nabout it. I suggest he send my Ministry the facts\r\n\r\nand probably ask me another question in Parliament\r\n\r\nso that I will be in a better position to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other four Members, we heard two\r\n\r\nelection speeches and two complaints. Both the\r\n\r\nMember for Delta and the Member for Sembawang had\r\n\r\noccasion to praise the Government's efforts at\r\n\r\nurban renewal. But they raised complaints about\r\n\r\nresettlement and enhanced rentals for Housing\r\n\r\nBoard shops.\r\n\r\nI hope both Members will realise that\r\n\r\nit is not possible to satisfy everyone's needs. To\r\n\r\ngive you an example, when Queenstown was first\r\n\r\nbuilt, no one wanted to go there. Now everyone\r\n\r\nwants to go to Queenstown. Of course, you cannot\r\n\r\nget there because the flats are occupied. At the\r\n\r\nmoment, few are happy to go to Toa Payoh. Tenants\r\n\r\nare very choosy. They not only want the particular\r\n\r\narea, but they also want a particular floor, not\r\n\r\ntoo high, not too low. Sometimes they want the\r\n\r\ncorner flat. As far as is possible, we accommodate\r\n\r\nthem. But someone has to go to the top, someone to\r\n\r\nthe bottom, someone in the middle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised to hear the Member for Delta\r\n\r\nsaying that resettlement went well until a year or\r\n\r\nso ago when resettlement officials adopted a\r\n\r\ndifferent attitude. They were rather harsh and\r\n\r\ndemanding, she alleges. And perhaps she says it is\r\n\r\nbecause there is no Opposition that these things\r\n\r\nare happening. I can assure the Member for Delta\r\n\r\nthat the officials of my Ministry were not afraid\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis. Either we have urban\r\n\r\nrenewal or we do not. In the process of urban\r\n\r\nrenewal, people must be inconvenienced.\r\n\r\nShopkeepers have to move out. Residents have to\r\n\r\nmove out. We cannot satisfy everybody. Otherwise\r\n\r\nwe will never evict the occupiers and, in fact, it\r\n\r\ntakes a very, very long time before\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplete vacant possession of any property is\r\n\r\nobtained. Shopkeepers, as the Member for Delta has\r\n\r\npointed out, pay cheaper rents than the shops they\r\n\r\noccupy in Housing Board accommodation. They always\r\n\r\ngrumble. But this tender system appears to be the\r\n\r\nfairest system and the best way to get at an\r\n\r\neconomic rent. When tenders are called for, there\r\n\r\nare no allegations of corruption. The Government\r\n\r\nis already subsidising, and subsidising heavily,\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats. What you are asking the\r\n\r\nGovernment now to do is also to subsidise\r\n\r\nbusinesses. This I am afraid my Ministry will not\r\n\r\nrecommend to the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang blames the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department of the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment for the outbreak of swine fever in\r\n\r\nSingapore. He says this was due to the neglect of\r\n\r\nthe Department particularly in not taking\r\n\r\npreventive measures. I have stated in this House\r\n\r\nbefore and I will state it again. The swine fever\r\n\r\nspread from Thailand to the north of Malaya. From\r\n\r\nnorthern Malaya it made its way down to Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur, then into Johore Bahru, and then across\r\n\r\nthe Causeway into Singapore. It did not start\r\n\r\nhere. It came in. What could we do? Prevent pigs\r\n\r\nfrom conhing into Singapore! We could have imposed\r\n\r\na ban but then there would have been smuggling of\r\n\r\npigs. All sorts of things are smuggled into Singa\r\n\r\npore, not only pigs but human beings too. This is\r\n\r\na good place. Everyone wants to come here. To have\r\n\r\nimposed a ban on pigs at the time would have meant\r\n\r\nthat infected pigs would have been smuggled in. We\r\n\r\ntherefore did not impose a ban in order to keep an\r\n\r\neye on the pigs across the Causeway. And when we\r\n\r\ndiscovered a lorry load of pigs\r\n\r\n- pigs that were actually suffering from the\r\n\r\ndisease - we had to impose a ban, which we did.\r\n\r\nBut I can assure you that the swine fever in\r\n\r\nSingapore has not been caused by any neglect in\r\n\r\nthe Primary Production Department. In fact, the\r\n\r\nofficials of the Department should be praised for\r\n\r\nthe preventive measures that they have taken\r\n\r\nsince. It was difficult explaining to the farmers\r\n\r\nthe necessity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor vaccination, and at first they could not be\r\n\r\nconvinced. They were only convinced after the\r\n\r\ndisease reached their farms. But officials of the\r\n\r\nDepartment had been working overtime on Saturdays\r\n\r\nand Sundays not only in vaccinating the pigs but\r\n\r\nalso in explaining the disease and its results and\r\n\r\neffects to the farmers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang, dealing with car\r\n\r\nparks, complains that parking places are all over\r\n\r\nthe town - or is it all over the island?

He praises me and my\r\n\r\nMinistry for the work done and at the same time he\r\n\r\nsays that probably I have not got the time to deal\r\n\r\nwith all these little matters. I can assure him\r\n\r\nthat I have plenty of time to deal with every\r\n\r\nlittle matter which he wishes to put on my desk. I\r\n\r\nwill certainly go into this. I am only sorry that\r\n\r\nit was not raised earlier. Hundreds of complaints\r\n\r\nand grouses come up to my Ministry and all are\r\n\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also suggested a supervisory committee in\r\n\r\nrespect of the Urban and Rural Services Committee.\r\n\r\nWe already have one committee, the U.R.S.C. We now\r\n\r\nhave another committe called the Projects Committe\r\n\r\nto look into requests approved or disapproved by\r\n\r\nthe U.R.S.C.   There was an adjournment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebate in this House running down the Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee. \"Two committees were too much.\" And now\r\n\r\nhe wants a third committee called the Supervisory\r\n\r\nCommittee to look after contractors and\r\n\r\ncomplaints. Complaints can always be sent to the\r\n\r\nU.R.S.C., whether in respect of contractors or\r\n\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will be brief in dealing with the Member\r\n\r\nfor Jurong who, in my view, was out of order when\r\n\r\nhe spoke on floods. Many questions have been asked\r\n\r\nin this House about floods and flooded areas and\r\n\r\nthe schemes and measures we have to alleviate\r\n\r\nthese floods. I do not propose to go into the\r\n\r\ndetails again. The reason that has been put\r\n\r\nforward for flooding is a high tide accompanied by\r\n\r\nvery heavy rain. But it is significant that in\r\n\r\nSingapore we do not have the floods that Malaysia\r\n\r\nhas, unfortunately, to undergo. At present, there\r\n\r\nare floods in Kota Tinggi which were caused by\r\n\r\nheavy rain over a fortnight. In Singapore, we are\r\n\r\ninconvenienced more than anything else. But we\r\n\r\nhave measures and schemes which are being put into\r\n\r\noperation. But I doubt very much whether we can\r\n\r\nreach the happy position where there will be no\r\n\r\nflooding in any street in Singapore. All you have\r\n\r\nto have is a high spring tide and you will have\r\n\r\nfloods in Telok Ayer. After all, we are a small\r\n\r\nisland and it is difficult to keep the tides out.\r\n\r\nWhen the high tide comes in and the rain pours, we\r\n\r\nare in trouble. But a major scheme is being\r\n\r\nundertaken along Bukit Timah Road where, as I have\r\n\r\nstated in the House before, we are cutting two\r\n\r\ncanals - one to Ulu Pandan and the other to\r\n\r\nKallang - to divert the flood waters from the\r\n\r\nBukit Timah area into Ulu Pandan and Kallang, so\r\n\r\nthat if the floods are not completely eliminated\r\n\r\nin the more seriously affected areas like the\r\n\r\nUniversity area, at least the severity of the\r\n\r\nfloods will be considerably reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the questions raised by me have not\r\n\r\nbeen answered\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirectly by the Minister.

A lot of these trades have found their\r\n\r\nown accommodation either because they refused to\r\n\r\nbe re-located to the rural areas or no suitable\r\n\r\nalternative acconhmodation could be offered by the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board. Under these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, they had no alternative but to\r\n\r\ncarry on their businesses in whatever\r\n\r\naccommodation they could obtain. A problem now\r\n\r\narises from their applications to the C.B.S.'s\r\n\r\nDepartment for a change of use of their present\r\n\r\npremises to suit their trades or to build\r\n\r\nwarehouses for their stock-in-trade. More often\r\n\r\nthan not, their applications are usually not\r\n\r\nfavourably considered. What is worse is that\r\n\r\nsubsequently they are served with notices of\r\n\r\ndemolition of the present structures into which\r\n\r\nthey have moved and are carrying on their\r\n\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to relax\r\n\r\ncertain regulations governing the change of use of\r\n\r\npremises or building by-laws if the applicants are\r\n\r\ndisplaced as a result of urban renewal with a view\r\n\r\nto allowing them to carry on their trades for a\r\n\r\ntemporary period. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do agree\r\n\r\nthat there must be a certain amount of control\r\n\r\nover the use of land or its development to comply\r\n\r\nwith the Master Plan, but special consideration\r\n\r\nsurely can be given to these displaced industries.\r\n\r\nSurely, it is not the intention of the Government\r\n\r\nto see a complete stoppage of operations of the\r\n\r\nexisting small trades or industries. On the\r\n\r\ncontrary, they should be allowed to carry on in\r\n\r\norder to adapt themselves to the changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances and should be given technical or\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance to expand their businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\namendment (2)*  stands in my name.

I\r\n\r\nwish to bring the following matters to the\r\n\r\nattention of the Minister for Law and National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. One is with regard to the issue of\r\n\r\ntemporary permits by the Department concerned at a\r\n\r\nfee of $12 per year. Originally, this fee was $2\r\n\r\nin respect of any temporary structure put up, but\r\n\r\nit appears to me that from 1966 onwards it has\r\n\r\nbeen increased to $12 - a very, very high increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I wish to point out is this.\r\n\r\nA temporary permit is issued for the erection of a\r\n\r\ndwelling-house of a temporary nature, a pigsty and\r\n\r\na bangsal. But what I am more concerned with is\r\n\r\nthe increase of fees from $2 to $12 especially\r\n\r\nwith regard to pigsties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you build two pigsties, you pay $24. If you\r\n\r\nbuild three, you pay $36. I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\nconsider that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, along that line, as I pointed out when\r\n\r\nI was debating on the Property Tax Division\r\n\r\nyesterday. I said that to obtain a house number,\r\n\r\nmuch time is taken up and the applicant has to\r\n\r\nwait for months before he ultimately gets a house\r\n\r\nnumber. But before that, he must obtain a\r\n\r\ntemporary permit for which he has to pay $12, and\r\n\r\nwhich has to be renewed every year. In addition to\r\n\r\npaying for a temporary permit for a dwelling\r\n\r\nhouse, the property tax has also to be considered.\r\n\r\nI am not talking about property tax now. I am\r\n\r\ndwelling on the fee for temporary permits, which I\r\n\r\nhope will be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point pertains to the application for\r\n\r\nthe necessary permit to reconstruct an existing\r\n\r\nbuilding, i.e., a numbered building. I am afraid I\r\n\r\nhave to spend a little time on details, and I hope\r\n\r\nthe House will bear with me.. First of all, the\r\n\r\napplicant fills in a prescribed form issued by the\r\n\r\nChief Building Surveyor's Department. In addition\r\n\r\nto it, he has to purchase from the Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment some site plans. On top of that, he has\r\n\r\nto make out a couple of layouts of the building\r\n\r\nplan, not forgetting that he has to obtain the\r\n\r\nlandowner's permission if he wishes to extend his\r\n\r\nhouse. And if the landowner refuses to sign, the\r\n\r\napplicant will not be able to make the necessary\r\n\r\napplication. I will deal with this a little later,\r\n\r\nSir, but first the application for reconstruction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been brought to my notice that there has\r\n\r\nbeen much delay in the processing of these\r\n\r\napplications. A number of applicants have seen me\r\n\r\non this and have appealed for a more simplified\r\n\r\nmethod whereby the rural folk will not be too much\r\n\r\ninconvenienced in having to wait for three or six\r\n\r\nmonths before they get the necessary permission to\r\n\r\nreconstruct their houses. And if they were to do\r\n\r\nit without the necessary permit, Sir - it is a\r\n\r\nwell-known fact that the reconstruction will be un\r\n\r\nauthorised - the Chief Building Surveyor's\r\n\r\nDepartment would step in and issue the necessary\r\n\r\nnotice, and subsequently a summons, stating that\r\n\r\nsuch unauthorised structures should be demolished\r\n\r\nwithin a certain time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the other point where the\r\n\r\nlandowner's permission is required. A number of\r\n\r\nlandowners have been reluctant to agree to\r\n\r\nreconstruction, and especially extensions, with\r\n\r\nthe result that the rural folk have nowhere to\r\n\r\nappeal for a reconsideration of their cases. They\r\n\r\nwould find extreme difficulty in getting a permit\r\n\r\nto reconstruct their houses.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask the Minister for Law and\r\n\r\nNational Development to look into this matter.\r\n\r\nIndeed it is no use to pretend that there has been\r\n\r\nno delay. I\r\n\r\nhave raised this matter with the department\r\n\r\nconcerned on quite a number of occasions, and I\r\n\r\nmention it again in this House; sometimes I get a\r\n\r\nvery blunt reply, if not none at all. And this\r\n\r\ncentres on the difficulties faced by an applicant -\r\n\r\nhis house is in a state of near collapse and he is\r\n\r\nunable to obtain the necessary permit to\r\n\r\nreconstruct it. And he cannot reconstruct it\r\n\r\nwithout proper permission. And whoever contravenes\r\n\r\nthe Local Government Integration Ordinance, 1963 -\r\n\r\nI believe it is section 52 - will be charged in\r\n\r\ncourt for putting up an unauthorised structure. I\r\n\r\nsincerely hope the Minister will look into this\r\n\r\nmatter with a view to solving the difficulties\r\n\r\nencountered by those who apply for such permits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Various problems have\r\n\r\narisen when owners of industries, workshops and\r\n\r\nwarehouses affected by the \"Golden Mile\"\r\n\r\ndevelopment have had to be resited. As I stated in\r\n\r\nanswer to a question by the hon.

And these\r\n\r\nfew cases have not been settled because, having\r\n\r\nleft the \"Golden Mile\", they sought other\r\n\r\naccommodation and occupied other pieces of land\r\n\r\nwithout consulting the relevant department. If they\r\n\r\nhad consulted the proper authority, they would have\r\n\r\nbeen advised what land they could occupy and for\r\n\r\nwhat purpose. Buying a piece of residential land,\r\n\r\nsetting up a factory, and then running to the\r\n\r\nPlanning Chief and saying, \"Please give me\r\n\r\npermission to change the zone from residential to\r\n\r\nindustrial,\" after the event as it were, has led to\r\n\r\nall these problems. In fact, these people do not\r\n\r\ndeserve sympathy. But every consideration is being\r\n\r\ngiven by the relevant department.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten, besides areas which are presently\r\n\r\nzoned as industrial land on the Master Plan, there\r\n\r\nare areas which can allow for industries and ware\r\n\r\nhouses. The Planning Department in the Ministry\r\n\r\nhave designated three other large areas for the\r\n\r\nresettlement of industries affected by the Urban Re\r\n\r\nnewal Scheme. These three large areas are Kampong\r\n\r\nChai Chee (7th mile Changi), Teck Hock Village (8th\r\n\r\nmile Tampines Road), and the South-east portion of\r\n\r\nBukit Panjang Town Map Area, which adjoins the\r\n\r\nexisting industrial zone. But if the Member's con\r\n\r\nstituents choose to go into other areas and then\r\n\r\ndecide to apply for rezoning, I say they are\r\n\r\nlooking for trouble. Each\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication for a change of use of premises is\r\n\r\nconsidered on its own merits. This must be so,\r\n\r\nhaving regard to the nature of the proposed use\r\n\r\nand the existing surrounding development. But the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Control Committee of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nNational Development has, in fact, relaxed its\r\n\r\ncontrol in many cases to allow industries on a\r\n\r\ntemporary basis in an area strictly prohibited\r\n\r\nunder the Master Plan zoning. But there are some\r\n\r\ncases, where, because of the previous history of\r\n\r\nthe premises and the nature of the industry, the\r\n\r\napplications have had to be refused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now deal with the Member for Punggol\r\n\r\nwho has raised two or three points. The first is\r\n\r\nthe increase of fees from $2 to $12 for temporary\r\n\r\nstructures; second, he complains about delays;\r\n\r\nand, thirdly, he complains about landowners\r\n\r\nrefusing to sign applications either to build or\r\n\r\nrebuild the premises. If I can deal with\r\n\r\nlandowners first. Under our building by-laws,\r\n\r\nlandowners have to give their consent and, if the\r\n\r\nlandowners refuse to give their consent, surely\r\n\r\nyou cannot blame the Chief Building Surveyor.\r\n\r\nBlame the landowner, blame our laws, but not the\r\n\r\nChief Building Surveyor. But we happen to be\r\n\r\ndiscussing the Chief Building Surveyor's\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I can go on to the delays which the\r\n\r\nMember alleges. He says it is no use pretending\r\n\r\nthat there are no delays. I am instructed that it\r\n\r\nis not true that applications are delayed for six\r\n\r\nmonths or more as alleged. What usually happens is\r\n\r\nthat the applicants have not put up their\r\n\r\napplications properly. Sometimes certain details\r\n\r\nhave been left out, and when the application is\r\n\r\nflung back, so to speak, to the applicant, nothing\r\n\r\ncomes back. And one common reason for the delays\r\n\r\nis the fact that many applicants cannot get the\r\n\r\napproval of the landowner to carry out whatever\r\n\r\nthey want to do. If I may say so, to complicate\r\n\r\nmatters, Members of Parliament are often\r\n\r\nmisinformed\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen they try to intervene on behalf of the\r\n\r\napplicants. But here the Member for Punggol is\r\n\r\nspeaking generally and I am replying generally. I\r\n\r\ncannot do otherwise until he gives me the facts\r\n\r\nand the specific cases. I say once again in this\r\n\r\nHouse, if you have a case of delay or if you have\r\n\r\ndozens of cases of delay, fling them at the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development. He will look into them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point which was raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Punggol is the increase of fees from $2 to\r\n\r\n$12. The facts are as follows. Prior to the coming\r\n\r\ninto force of the Local Government Building Re\r\n\r\ngulations, 1966, the temporary permit fee charged\r\n\r\nfor the rural areas by the Rural Board was $5 per\r\n\r\nannum for the permit and $2 per annum for\r\n\r\nrenewals. This was the previous position. In the\r\n\r\ncity area the Chief Building Surveyor charged a\r\n\r\nfee of $6 per annum for each permit for renewal.\r\n\r\nSo for the rural areas, $5 per permit, $2 for\r\n\r\nrenewal. For the city area $6 for the permit. $6\r\n\r\nfor renewal, So it has not gone up six times, as\r\n\r\nthe Member's speech may have indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the\r\n\r\nMinister. It is clearly stated that the fee for\r\n\r\nthe temporary permit is $12 per year for renewal.\r\n\r\nFormerly it was $2 in the rural areas. Now it is\r\n\r\n$12 per year. There is an increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, there is. But it was $6 for\r\n\r\nrenewal in the urban area. That is admitted. But I\r\n\r\nthink we are wasting our time over these figures.\r\n\r\nWith the integration of the two and in view of the\r\n\r\nincrease in administrative costs, the fees were\r\n\r\nchanged with a flat rate of $12 per annum for a\r\n\r\ntemporary permit for renewal. On this, I am some\r\n\r\nwhat inclined to agree with the Member for Punggol\r\n\r\nthat the present fee appears to be rather high and\r\n\r\nI promise him that I will look into it. I make no\r\n\r\npromise of any decrease. But I promise\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim that I will look into it with a view to\r\n\r\nmeeting his request.
