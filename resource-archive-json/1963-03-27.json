The House has had a  long\r\n\r\nvacation and I am sure all Honourable Members,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker  and  also  the staff of  this  House  have\r\n\r\nrecovered  from  the stresses and  strains  of  the\r\n\r\nrigorous  Third  Session which ended  in  September\r\n\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Session, there will not be the same air of\r\n\r\nexcitement and uncertainty. The referendum  on  1st\r\n\r\nSeptember  helped to settle many things.  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  weathered  the  storm; the tempest  has  spent\r\n\r\nitself.  All  is  calm and tranquil.  But  we  must\r\n\r\nalways  be  vigilant. There are still some  in  our\r\n\r\nmidst  actively trying to disrupt national security\r\n\r\nand sabotage our plans for Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True they have this time lost the open argument\r\n\r\nand their dishonesty has been exposed. But they are\r\n\r\nreforming and re-aligning their forces. The  recent\r\n\r\ndecision of the Internal Security Council  did  not\r\n\r\nremove  the Communist United Front framework.  Only\r\n\r\nthe  key  activists in the Communist  United  Front\r\n\r\nConspiracy  have been neutralised. And  several  of\r\n\r\nthese    eluded   the   security   net.   Communist\r\n\r\nunderground leaders are still at large. These anti-national elements know that they have been defeated\r\n\r\nin  this round of the battle for Malaysia,  but  we\r\n\r\nmust always be prepared to meet any renewed attacks\r\n\r\nbefore 31st August, and there will be the grim long-term battle thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile there will be hard work for the State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General  and the legal  draftsmen  in  his\r\n\r\nChambers.  They have to ensure that all the  points\r\n\r\nagreed to in the White Paper Command 33 of 1961  as\r\n\r\namplified  or  amended in the formal  exchanges  of\r\n\r\nletters   between  the  Prime  Ministers   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation and Singapore are duly enshrined in  the\r\n\r\nConstitutions, both of the Federation  of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand of the State of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members of this House will have noticed\r\n\r\nin  the last seven months, while all was peace  and\r\n\r\ntranquility, that many works of construction  which\r\n\r\nwere  planned  in  the  years  1959  to  1961  have\r\n\r\nprogressed  rapidly  and are day  by  day  reaching\r\n\r\ncompletion.  Every  week sees the  opening  of  new\r\n\r\nhousing   blocks,   schools,   community   centres,\r\n\r\nclinics,  creches,  new  roads,  old  roads   being\r\n\r\nwidened,   street   lights,  drains,   stand-pipes,\r\n\r\nelectric supply and all the other things which make\r\n\r\nSingapore a civilized place for everyone, rich  and\r\n\r\npoor alike, to live in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the careful budgeting and the economy\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken in 1959-60, and the  prosperity  in\r\n\r\n1961 to 1963, the financial position of the country\r\n\r\nis sound. There are funds to see us through all the\r\n\r\nmajor  projects  for  tile immediate  years  ahead.\r\n\r\nAmong  these projects are the Toa Payoh  new  town,\r\n\r\nthe re-building and re-development of the old city,\r\n\r\nand the Jurong industrial base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most significant and gratifying of all has been\r\n\r\nthe  quiet  and steady expansion of new  factories.\r\n\r\nEvery  other  week  sees the opening  of  some  new\r\n\r\nindustrial  enterprise. Every month  sees  a  major\r\n\r\nproject  take shape in the Jurong Industrial  Site.\r\n\r\nThe future augurs well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With merger and Malaysia the internal threat,\r\n\r\ndisorder,  uncertainty, instability  and  Communist\r\n\r\nUnited  Front attacks will all slowly  recede.  But\r\n\r\nnew   problems  have  appeared  over  the  horizon.\r\n\r\nHonourable Members of the House must have known  of\r\n\r\nthe   deep   regret  the  people  felt   over   the\r\n\r\ndifferences that have arisen between the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  and  the Republic of  Indonesia.  These\r\n\r\ndifferences were in part due to the rapid  fruition\r\n\r\nof the plans for Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome recent developments to ease relations\r\n\r\nbetween Kuala Lumpur, the heart and capital of  our\r\n\r\nnew  Malaysia, and Jakarta, our most immediate  and\r\n\r\npowerful neighbour. We know that there are friendly\r\n\r\npowers  both  in  this region  and  in  the  world,\r\n\r\ninterested  in the maintenance of world  peace  and\r\n\r\nsecurity, who are doing all they can to reduce  the\r\n\r\ntension that now exists. We hope that their efforts\r\n\r\nwill   succeed   and  will  restore  the   friendly\r\n\r\nrelations between Malaya and Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, over the last year our Ministers and\r\n\r\nleaders  of the trade union movement have,  through\r\n\r\ntheir contacts with Afro-Asian nations, contributed\r\n\r\nto   a   greater  understanding  among   Afro-Asian\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders of Malaysia, and thereby  helped\r\n\r\ncounter  the  hostile anti-Malaysia  propaganda  in\r\n\r\nthese countries by the enemies of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish to live in peace with all our neighbours\r\n\r\nin  South-East Asia. But we realise our destiny  is\r\n\r\nirrevocably  interwoven with that of  Malaysia.  So\r\n\r\nwhatever minor differences may arise from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime   between  Singapore  and  Kuala  Lumpur  over\r\n\r\nchickens  and  eggs, or pigs and paints,  we  stand\r\n\r\nsolidly  with them on all the vital questions  that\r\n\r\naffect  Malaysia, the integrity of our territories,\r\n\r\nand  the  survival of our people. We have a  vested\r\n\r\ninterest  in Malaysia and its continued prosperity,\r\n\r\nand we must always be prepared to defend it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>FINANCE</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the stresses and strains of the political\r\n\r\nsituation and its effect on the economy in the last\r\n\r\nthree  and a half years, the financial position  of\r\n\r\nthe  State has shown steady progress throughout the\r\n\r\nperiod.  In 1959, when the present Government  took\r\n\r\nover,  there  was  a  balance in  the  Consolidated\r\n\r\nRevenue  Account of only $87.2 million.  There  was\r\n\r\nnot a single cent in the Development Fund!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the last year the Consolidated\r\n\r\nRevenue Account has increased to $215.4 million and\r\n\r\nthe  Development Fund stood at $120.0 million. This\r\n\r\nincrease in the financial reserves of the State  is\r\n\r\nall the more significant because it took place even\r\n\r\nafter  substantial capital outlays  made  from  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund  of more than $100  million  each\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four-Year Plan introduced in 1961 is now in\r\n\r\nfull  swing.  Early teething troubles have  largely\r\n\r\nbeen  solved.  All Ministries and  departments  are\r\n\r\nbending   their   energies  to  carry   out   their\r\n\r\ndevelopment   projects.  The  Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard   is   now  firmly  established,  effectively\r\n\r\nplaying its role in industrial development.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe  Government's principal agency in the promotion\r\n\r\nof  industrial growth.

They will be months of hard work\r\n\r\nfor  those  Ministers and officials  responsible\r\n\r\nfor re-drafting the constitution of Singapore as\r\n\r\na  State  within the framework of the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaysia. There is also the intricate problem\r\n\r\nof  working out Singapore's contribution to  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Government  for  Federal  Services   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, as agreed in the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first six to twelve months\r\n\r\nfollowing   the   31st  of   August,   the   new\r\n\r\nconstitutional  arrangements  will  have  to  he\r\n\r\nsmoothly    implemented.   Defence,    Singapore\r\n\r\nInfantry  Regiment and the other  Armed  Forces,\r\n\r\nPolice  and  Prisons, all come under the  direct\r\n\r\ncontrol   of   the  Federal  Government.   Other\r\n\r\ndepartments  such as Customs and Excise,  Income\r\n\r\nTax,  Broadcasting and Television, will all have\r\n\r\nto   follow   overall  Federal   policy   whilst\r\n\r\nremaining     under    State    control.     The\r\n\r\nimplementation of these arrangements after  31st\r\n\r\nAugust  will  require a great deal of  tact  and\r\n\r\npatience.    We   are   confident   that    with\r\n\r\nunderstanding   and   brotherly   give-and-take,\r\n\r\ntemporary dislocations can be kept to a minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our firm determination to ensure that\r\n\r\nthose  departments which go over to the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment   should  maintain  the  highest   of\r\n\r\nstandards between now and the 31st August.  Even\r\n\r\nmore   important,  we  must  ensure  that   they\r\n\r\ncontinue to keep those standards ever high after\r\n\r\nthe 31st of August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime construction must press ahead.\r\n\r\n1963,  the year Malaysia comes into being,  will\r\n\r\nhe  marked  in Singapore by massive construction\r\n\r\nin  public housing, schools, community  centres,\r\n\r\ncreches,  hospitals,  clinics,  roads,  bridges,\r\n\r\ndrains,  electricity, water, and most  important\r\n\r\nof all, in the number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew factories that will give jobs to our people,\r\n\r\nand  build  a  modern  industrial  city  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This  is a task  to  which  we  must\r\n\r\ndedicate ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a task which can and will succeed if the\r\n\r\nhighest standards of integrity of public service\r\n\r\nare  maintained, not only amongst the  political\r\n\r\nleaders  and the Government officials, but  also\r\n\r\namongst the leaders of trade unions and of trade\r\n\r\nand commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can take pride at the steady progress we\r\n\r\nare   making  as  one  plan  after  another   is\r\n\r\ncompleted  week by week, day by day. The  people\r\n\r\nhave  quite  rightly a distaste for  unnecessary\r\n\r\npolitical party strife, and there has been  less\r\n\r\nof it. Moreover, no more great issues divide the\r\n\r\npeople.   We   must  proceed  apace   with   our\r\n\r\nconstruction. Above all, we must be united,  for\r\n\r\nif  we  allow  the  enemy from outside,  working\r\n\r\nthrough anti-national elements in our midst,  to\r\n\r\ndivide  us,  then  we shall  lack  the  strength\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  resist their pressures.  We  must\r\n\r\nalways  also  resist  the pressure  of  internal\r\n\r\nenemies  and  prevent them  from  upsetting  our\r\n\r\nstability and prosperity, for it is the material\r\n\r\nprogress  of  ordinary people that is  the  best\r\n\r\nguarantee of the constant failure of their  arid\r\n\r\ndogma  of violence and the continued success  of\r\n\r\nour tolerant and prosperous society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech, Mr Speaker, preceded  by  the\r\n\r\nSerjeant at Arms, the Clerk, the Clerk-Assistant\r\n\r\nand  the  Second Clerk-Assistant,  escorted  His\r\n\r\nExcellency (accompanied by two A.D.C.s)  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chamber, and the Assembly adjourned without\r\n\r\nquestion put, pursuant to the Standing Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at 7.06 p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
