The concentration level of  110\r\n\r\nmg/100  ml is within the range of the legal limits  of\r\n\r\nblood  alcohol concentration adopted by the courts  in\r\n\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely that we introduce this particular\r\n\r\namendment because in -our experience it has been  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  certify whether  or  not  a  person  is\r\n\r\nintoxicated.  Much depends on the individual  judgment\r\n\r\nof  the medical practitioner. The physical state of  a\r\n\r\npatient who is involved in a road traffic accident and\r\n\r\nwho has been admitted to a hospital has been variously\r\n\r\ndescribed  in  terms  of whether he  is  conscious  or\r\n\r\nunconscious,  rational or irrational,  or  whether  he\r\n\r\nsmells  of  alcohol,  or  whether  he  is,  sometimes,\r\n\r\nallegedly claimed to be intoxicated. The fact that  we\r\n\r\nnow have a legal provision for a blood level of 110 mg\r\n\r\nis  to me a necessity. This particular amendment makes\r\n\r\nit  compulsory that all these people be subject  to  a\r\n\r\nblood test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if he had taken\r\n\r\ninto consideration the fact that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent  people have different tolerance to  alcohol\r\n\r\nand  if, in fact, this blood level of 110 mg is a fair\r\n\r\nlevel  to  be  placed. Secondly, could he inform  this\r\n\r\nHouse as to the specific blood levels imposed by other\r\n\r\ncountries,  and  how  do  we compare  to  these  other\r\n\r\nlevels. I understand that in the United Kingdom it  is\r\n\r\nin  the  region of 80 mg. Perhaps he could  inform  us\r\n\r\nmore  about  this provision in the other countries  of\r\n\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister also inform this House as to the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  persons in the past year or two  who  were\r\n\r\ninvolved  in road traffic accidents and were found  to\r\n\r\nbe intoxicated at the time of the accident?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, could the Minister explain in layman's\r\n\r\nterms  what this blood level of 110 mg means. Does  it\r\n\r\nmean consuming two bottles of beer or three bottles of\r\n\r\nstout  or four pegs of whisky? This seems to us to  be\r\n\r\nmore meaningful than a blood level of 110 mg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would  just ask the Minister whether  in  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  this  law  there  would  arise   a\r\n\r\nsituation where a blood test is required but it is not\r\n\r\navailable  under  the circumstances,  and  in  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation should the person concerned be unable at the\r\n\r\nparticular  time to produce the required urine, would\r\n\r\nthat   constitute  a  justifiable  reason  under   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Kim Seng's support of  the  Bill.  He\r\n\r\nraised  a number of questions. Perhaps I should  first\r\n\r\nanswer  the  last point about the blood level  of  110\r\n\r\nmg/100 ml in layman's terms. Generally speaking, if  a\r\n\r\nperson has consumed three full pegs of hard liquor  or\r\n\r\nthree  large  bottles of beer within a  space  of  one\r\n\r\nhour, his blood alcohol concentration would be in  the\r\n\r\nregion  of  110 mg of alcohol in 100 ml  of  blood.  A\r\n\r\nnormal   whisky/water   or   brandy/dry   served    in\r\n\r\nrestaurants  or  bars contains  half  a  peg  of  hard\r\n\r\nliquor. That would give some idea of the blood alcohol\r\n\r\nconcentration in layman's terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Senior Forensic Pathologist has confirmed that a\r\n\r\nperson  with  such a concentration of alcohol  in  his\r\n\r\nbody  is  not in a fit state to drive a motor vehicle,\r\n\r\nand his opinion has been supported by many experiments\r\n\r\ncarried  out in other countries throughout the  world.\r\n\r\nIn  ordinary  circumstances, a seasoned drinker,  even\r\n\r\nthough  he may be an experienced driver, will  not  be\r\n\r\nable to have proper control of his vehicle with such a\r\n\r\nlevel of blood alcohol concentration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the different legal limits adopted by\r\n\r\nother   countries  on  blood  alcohol   concentration,\r\n\r\nMembers  would be interested to know that this  ranges\r\n\r\nfrom  a  very  low  30  mg/100  ml  in  Bulgaria   and\r\n\r\nCzechoslovakia 50 mg/i 00 ml in Norway and Sweden;  80\r\n\r\nmg/100  ml in the United Kingdom and France; and  80-1\r\n\r\n50  mg/100  ml  in the United States of  America.

The amendments proposed\r\n\r\nabove will enable many of the cases presently with the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court  to  be  transferred  to  the  Subordinate\r\n\r\nCourts, and be dealt with more expeditiously, with the\r\n\r\nadditional  staff  (one  District  Judge   and   three\r\n\r\nMagistrates)   being  provided  for  the   Subordinate\r\n\r\nCourts,  in  the  coming fiscal year. This  will  thus\r\n\r\neffectively  off-load  some  of  the  work  that   has\r\n\r\npreviously been done in the High Court. Besides, costs\r\n\r\nwill  be much less in the Subordinate Courts, and  the\r\n\r\nprocedure much simplified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments made to sections 28 and 29 of the\r\n\r\nSubordinate   Courts   Act  seek   to   increase   the\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the District Courts to enable them  to\r\n\r\ngrant  probate or letters of administration in respect\r\n\r\nof  estates which do not exceed $50,000 in value. This\r\n\r\nis in line with the exemption from estate duty granted\r\n\r\nby the Minister for Finance in April 1974 on the first\r\n\r\n$50,000 of the total value of any property left  by  a\r\n\r\ndeceased person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr E.W.

The Probate and Administration\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill seeks to increase the jurisdiction of\r\n\r\nthe  District Court to enable it to grant probate  and\r\n\r\nletters of administration in respect of estates  which\r\n\r\ndo  not  exceed $50,000 in value. This provision  will\r\n\r\nagain  off-load some of the work handled by  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to increase the power of the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Assignee to administer, without  letters  of\r\n\r\nadministration, the estates of persons who  have  died\r\n\r\nleaving property in Singapore, the value of which does\r\n\r\nnot  exceed  $50,000.  Under  the  existing  law,  the\r\n\r\nOfficial Assignee may only administer the property  of\r\n\r\nsuch  persons  without  letters of  administration  if\r\n\r\ntheir estates do not exceed $10,000 in value. In  view\r\n\r\nof  the increase in the rate of Central Provident Fund\r\n\r\ncontributions,  most  Singaporeans  will  be   leaving\r\n\r\nestates exceeding $10,000 in value when they die. This\r\n\r\nproposal in the Bill will enable the Official Assignee\r\n\r\nto  administer such estates summarily if they  do  not\r\n\r\nexceed $50,000 in value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr E.W.

Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps I should explain to Members what the\r\n\r\nMaintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act is all\r\n\r\nabout.  Should a Member of this House desert his  wife\r\n\r\nand  run  off to some other country, leaving his  wife\r\n\r\nand children without means, then the wife can apply to\r\n\r\na Singapore court for an order for maintenance. But if\r\n\r\nthe  errant  husband is not in Singapore, one  cannot\r\n\r\nenforce  the order. Should he run off with some  other\r\n\r\nwoman  to  another country, then the  order  which  is\r\n\r\nobtained  in  Singapore  can be  sent  to  that  other\r\n\r\ncountry  for  enforcement  in  that  country's   court\r\n\r\nprovided,  of  course, we have reciprocal arrangements\r\n\r\nwith that country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will recall that the Maintenance\r\n\r\nOrders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1975, was enacted\r\n\r\nin July, 1975, to introduce certain changes in the law\r\n\r\nrelating   to   the   enforcement  in   Singapore   of\r\n\r\nmaintenance  orders made elsewhere,  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nenforcement  in other countries of maintenance  orders\r\n\r\nmade  in  Singapore.  Before the  said  Act  could  be\r\n\r\nbrought  into force, we sought the views of countries.\r\n\r\nwhich    had   previously   entered   into    existing\r\n\r\narrangements  with  us for reciprocal  enforcement  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance  orders, as to whether they were  able  to\r\n\r\nenter into new arrangements based on our new Act. Sir,\r\n\r\nin the Law Ministers' Conference in Lagos, Nigeria, in\r\n\r\n1974,   most  countries  agreed  to  pass  appropriate\r\n\r\namendments to their Reciprocal Enforcement Act so that\r\n\r\nthese  new arrangements could be made. But up  to-date\r\n\r\nsome countries have replied that they are unable to do\r\n\r\nso  as  their  laws have not been changed.  For  these\r\n\r\ncountries, therefore, it will be necessary to continue\r\n\r\nthe existing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrangements  made  on  the  basis  of  the   existing\r\n\r\nMaintenance   Orders  (Reciprocal   Enforcement)   Act\r\n\r\n(Chapter 26).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1975 Act has a provision which seeks to repeal\r\n\r\nthe existing Act. It is, therefore, necessary to defer\r\n\r\nthe repeal of the existing Act until all countries can\r\n\r\nmake  arrangements for the reciprocal  enforcement  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance orders on the basis of the 1 975 Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill, therefore, seeks to amend the 1975\r\n\r\nAct to include a provision to empower the Minister  in\r\n\r\ncharge to appoint different dates for the coming  into\r\n\r\noperation of the different provisions of the Act. This\r\n\r\nwill  enable  the 1 975 Act to be brought  into  force\r\n\r\nexcept  for  the provision which seeks to  repeal  the\r\n\r\nexisting Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.
