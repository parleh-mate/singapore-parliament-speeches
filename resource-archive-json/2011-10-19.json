While we can pride ourselves with having a safe,\r\nsecure and prosperous Singapore, we cannot ignore the fact that\r\nthere is still a large segment of our fellow Singaporeans earning\r\nlow wages. Based on 2011 WIS recipients, it is estimated that we\r\nhave more than 400,000 workers earning a salary below $1,700.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fb9b3e83-3117-4822-84cb-324908202bda\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-fb9b3e83-3117-4822-84cb-324908202bda\"><!--a--></a>I have met many low-wage\r\nworkers through my work with the NTUC, and at Meet-the-People sessions.\r\nThere are employers that take advantage of their vulnerable position.\r\nFor example, many cleaners, not only do they earn low salaries,\r\na major component of it will be in the form of reimbursements such\r\nas transport, laundry or mobile phone allowances that do not attract\r\nCPF payments or included in overtime work calculations. Many struggle\r\nto meet the basic needs of their family members, and may not have\r\njob security, and may be afraid to speak up for their rights as\r\nthey may feel worried about losing their jobs, especially if they\r\nare older workers. Rising costs have made their daily struggles\r\neven harder. Although the Singapore economy has performed well over\r\nthe years, there is an increasing wealth divide.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 241</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6aa1f5c6-57a4-440f-bbb2-5a22989ce330\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-6aa1f5c6-57a4-440f-bbb2-5a22989ce330\"><!--a--></a>We have done much to improve\r\nthe life of our low-wage workers. Several Members of Parliament\r\nyesterday have made several suggestions on what could be done to\r\nhelp needy families or low-wage workers. I fully support their suggestions.\r\nWhile I acknowledge that a lot has been done to help low-wage workers,\r\nwe can still do more. Recently, it was reported in the papers that\r\nthe real income growth for low-wage workers for the past 10 years\r\nhas been flat. Sir, I would like to urge the Government to ensure\r\nthat the push to increase real wages by 30% in the next 10 years\r\nwill be felt by low- wage workers as they are the ones who are most\r\nin need of higher salaries. In fact, I would like to suggest revising\r\nthe target for low-wage workers' salaries to increase in real terms\r\nby 50% in the next decade so that there will be an even greater\r\nimpact on these workers. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e08e0a41-4368-475a-8d99-63dc40dd95d3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-e08e0a41-4368-475a-8d99-63dc40dd95d3\"><!--a--></a>Last Monday, NTUC together\r\nwith our tripartite partners reviewed and discussed our efforts\r\nto help low-wage workers. NTUC has been championing the Workfare\r\nIncome Supplement, Workfare Training Scheme, and Inclusive Growth\r\nProgramme and encouraging companies to embark on \"Best Sourcing\"\r\ninstead of \"Cheap Sourcing\". We do have many success stories to\r\nshow how these schemes helped boost productivity and led to wage\r\nincreases for low-wage workers and NTUC fully support such initiatives. Personally,\r\nI have two questions. First, are the salary increments given to\r\nthese more productive workers equivalent to the productivity gains?\r\nSecond, is the impact from NTUC's efforts alone, widespread enough\r\nto make a real difference to the 400,000 low-wage workers out there?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-14255296-c793-42bd-bad5-8c45db78be55\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-14255296-c793-42bd-bad5-8c45db78be55\"><!--a--></a> Sir, as a labour MP, I\r\nwould like to urge that the drive towards achieving sustained real\r\nwage growth for low-wage workers be a Key Performance Indicator\r\nfor every Ministry, Government agency, statutory board and social\r\nenterprise. We must do this as a shared national initiative to help\r\nour fellow Singaporeans. We cannot afford to have any Ministry or\r\norganisation to take a \"<em class=\"ph i\">bo-chap</em>\" attitude in ensuring better\r\nwages and better working conditions for their workers. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f1884980-1f7b-4bff-89bd-6d0074196633\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-f1884980-1f7b-4bff-89bd-6d0074196633\"><!--a--></a>Sir, for a start, every\r\nMinistry and Government-related organisation must take ownership\r\nof the Inclusive Growth Programme. NTUC has been driving the Inclusive Growth\r\nProgramme (IGP) to help companies boost their productivity and share\r\nthe productivity gains with the low-wage workers but, there is an\r\nurgent need for this programme to be ramped up quickly for a greater\r\nwidespread impact. Unless, Government agencies take the lead in\r\nimplementing IGP, we may not realise the full impact of IGP in helping\r\nlow-wage workers. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9efcfdaf-785d-4673-bdbd-ebf4884ead64\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-9efcfdaf-785d-4673-bdbd-ebf4884ead64\"><!--a--></a>In my conversation with\r\nunion leaders on the plight of low-wage workers, many have lamented\r\nthat the strategy of outsourcing manual or blue-collar jobs in many organisations,\r\nincluding Government bodies, has partly contributed to the current situation\r\nof depressed wages for these workers. While outsourcing has many\r\nbenefits \u2013 such as saving operational costs, keeping companies economically\r\nnimble and allowing them to focus on their core businesses \u2013 it\r\nhas its drawbacks, too. Competition amongst service providers inadvertently\r\nleads to cost-cutting and this manifests itself in the form of low\r\nsalaries for their workers. To make matters worse, contractual obligations spanning\r\na few years at fixed contract price means that the salary of these\r\nlow-wage workers will stagnate. Sir, we should ask ourselves this\r\nquestion, is it morally justifiable to save cost through outsourcing\r\nat the expense of workers' salary?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 242</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-756bb3ce-a262-4406-9605-a2d99e01202d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-756bb3ce-a262-4406-9605-a2d99e01202d\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I would like our Government\r\nMinistries and statutory boards to re-look at the strategy of outsourcing\r\njobs that are needed on a daily basis. I recall when I was a child, my\r\nfather was a civil servant as he worked as a daily-rated worker\r\nwith PWD. As a result, my whole family had medical benefits that\r\ncovered public clinic consultations. We did not have a lot of comforts\r\nbut our basic needs were met. I wish this can be the case for all\r\nlow-wage workers working in Government bodies to be direct employees\r\nso that they are protected from the bluntness of the economic system.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-312c2c66-9339-4a90-8933-0c317883d6d8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-312c2c66-9339-4a90-8933-0c317883d6d8\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I do understand having\r\nthese workers as direct employees will lead to higher expenditure\r\nfor Ministries and public institutions, and this seems to go against\r\nthe principle of exercising prudence in spending public funds. However,\r\nwe should ask ourselves even if we can quantify the savings made\r\nfrom outsourcing, what is the social cost to it? If we spend more\r\nof public funds to have low-wage workers as direct employees of\r\nthe public sector, while ensuring that they have higher salaries\r\nand better benefits, would it not translate to looking after the\r\nneeds and welfare of Singapore workers? Moreover, having workers\r\nas direct employees will increase the worker's sense of belonging\r\nto the public service and they will feel that the Government is\r\ntaking care of their interests. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b4b6fb33-97f8-4def-9045-751ada1f8ca7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-b4b6fb33-97f8-4def-9045-751ada1f8ca7\"><!--a--></a>Sir, if employing these\r\nlow-wage workers as direct employees is not viable for whatever\r\nreasons, I would propose then for Ministries and Government bodies\r\nto practise \"Best Sourcing\" according to its rationale and intent.\r\nBased on our sense on the ground, there will be less resistance\r\nfrom the Ministries if the Ministry of Finance reviews the financial\r\ncompliance guidelines in the Government's Instruction Manual to be\r\nmore explicitly in supporting \"Best Sourcing\". NTUC, as the champion\r\nfor workers, is willing to work with the MOF on this and work with\r\nother Ministries on its implementation.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9799859d-6301-4d13-8a5a-de4b4980e811\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-9799859d-6301-4d13-8a5a-de4b4980e811\"><!--a--></a> Sir, \"Best Sourcing\" is\r\nnot new to NTUC which has been actively championing \"Best Sourcing\"\r\nas an initiative to help low-wage workers earn better salaries and employment\r\nterms.

I support this call and would like to suggest that MOM\r\nand NTUC work on a list of good service providers that give fair wages\r\nand employment terms to their workers. Ministries and public institutions\r\nshould then consider only tenders put up by these companies recognised\r\nby the unions.

Workers under this contract will typically have stagnant\r\nwages for six years. I think this is totally unacceptable. I would\r\nlike to encourage Ministries to relook their existing contract with\r\nservice providers to enable that these workers do enjoy wage increments\r\ninstead of earning the same salary for the duration of the fixed price\r\ncontract. This is something that must be done if the Government\r\nis serious in helping low-wage workers earn sustainable real wage\r\nincreases of 30% \u2013 or was it 50% \u2013 in 10 years.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 243</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ce581052-8038-4459-916f-171f4ae6e3c3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-ce581052-8038-4459-916f-171f4ae6e3c3\"><!--a--></a>If all these measures do\r\nnot sufficiently address the issue, then we might have to think\r\nabout introducing a law to make service buyers legally accountable\r\nfor the welfare of these workers.

Yesterday, in his maiden speech, Mr Chen shared his views\r\non the importance of investment in human capital. Fundamentally,\r\nour Government is and has always been aware of its importance and\r\na substantial amount of investment was made in areas of transport\r\ninfrastructure, qualities, opportunities in education, healthcare\r\nand housing. I was surprised that he opined that Singaporeans have\r\nbeen under-served in recent years in these areas. I have lived and\r\nworked in Singapore for 46 years and over the years, undeniably,\r\nwe have made much improvements and progress in these key areas.\r\nWhile I acknowledge that there are areas for improvement, I would\r\nnot go to the extent to say Singaporeans have been under-served.\r\nIn education, for instance, which I have been part of for the past\r\n20 years, I have seen and experienced the transformation of the\r\neducation service designed to mould the future of the nation. In\r\nevery undertaking we did, we are constantly guided in providing\r\nthe best for our children for we believe this would be best for\r\nSingapore. Our education system has been acknowledged by many independent\r\ninternational bodies to be among the best in the world. Mr Chen,\r\nlet me assure you that Singaporeans have not been under-served in\r\nterms of investment in education. However, I would like to give\r\nMr Chen the benefit of doubt in his view and look forward to hearing\r\nhis alternative proposal to better our education system. Sir, I support\r\nthe motion.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-b2a5f0ae-20af-43c9-a661-cc4c4ed8e8c2\">\r\n               <a name=\"president-address__id-b2a5f0ae-20af-43c9-a661-cc4c4ed8e8c2\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-386622f1-70be-481d-9db1-ac2644e994aa\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-386622f1-70be-481d-9db1-ac2644e994aa\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nThank you, Mr Speaker.

To address these issues, the Ministry of Health\r\nintends to involve more GPs rather than building more polyclinics\r\nwhich takes up precious land resources. One new idea is to allow\r\nGPs to form Family Medical Centres (FMCs) where subsidised patients\r\ncan receive treatment, thus reducing the queue at polyclinics. But\r\nGPs have told me that having a group of GPs work together will achieve its\r\nintended goal only if they are equally competent and attract roughly\r\nthe same number of patients. If FMCs become the preferred healthcare\r\nprovider and GPs earn more as a result of many more subsidised patients,\r\nmore well-off patients who are not subsidised will turn to polyclinics\r\nand join the long queues there. Would this motivate more doctors\r\nto join the private sector? If this happens, overcrowding at polyclinics\r\nwill remain.

If our parents show passion for\r\neducation, it will rub off on the students too. Thus, our schools\r\nshould consider how we can, within our constraints, infuse the learning\r\nenvironment with passion for both teaching and learning. I am all\r\nfor the new emphasis on Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), but\r\nI agree with the view that unless our people feel passionately for\r\nthe subject, the perception many will have is that it is merely\r\nanother piece of \"propaganda\".</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-86526c9c-5dc5-4e23-bb00-aa0ff7cc86cc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-86526c9c-5dc5-4e23-bb00-aa0ff7cc86cc\"><!--a--></a>Mr Tan also talked about\r\nthe importance of promoting family bonding which was more evident\r\nto him in the US.

Hence, I urge MCYS to consider\r\noffering parenting workshops at all community centres or clubs to\r\npromote family bonding, conduct sharing sessions on how to bond\r\nwith children, make them aware of the importance of being rooted\r\nin family values. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8b25ab5a-4154-4f04-bbd3-dcf86804dd8f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-8b25ab5a-4154-4f04-bbd3-dcf86804dd8f\"><!--a--></a>Sir, Mr Bill Gates once\r\ngave a talk at a school where he told the audience that their parents\r\ndid not use to be so boring but that they got to be that way by\r\npaying bills that keep their children in school, buying food to\r\nprovide them with meals, washing their clothes to keep them clean,\r\nand so on. Parents need to teach the lesson of appreciation at home\r\nand this has to be reinforced at school by CCE in our children's\r\nformative years.

Globally, the capital market\r\nwas flushed with cash, resulting in very low interest rates for\r\nmortgages. In an effort to fix the 2008 banking crisis, central\r\nbanks loosened their monetary policy, resulting in global liquidity\r\noverflows. Mr Vikram Nair described it as \"a sea of money\", actually\r\nmore like an ocean. Much of this excess liquidity went into properties\r\nand other capital assets, especially in Asia. An exuberant property\r\nmarket was not unique to Singapore. It was hot in China and Hong\r\nKong too. Domestically, a sharp increase in residential population\r\npushed demand up faster than the supply of housing units. Dealing\r\nwith the uncertainties post-SARS, we had opened up the labour market\r\nso that we could seize the opportunities that came along for our\r\neconomy to survive. It was on the back of this growth that we were\r\nable to come out of the 2008 financial crisis very quickly. Minister\r\nof State Lawrence Wong gave a good account of this policy trade-off just\r\nyesterday. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bd302712-ef4a-4140-a7c1-cbfe4265f07b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-bd302712-ef4a-4140-a7c1-cbfe4265f07b\"><!--a--></a>But the resultant imbalance\r\nin housing supply and demand drove home prices up. The solution\r\nto an imbalance problem seems straightforward enough: reduce demand and\r\nincrease supply until the desired balance is struck. Then the price\r\nwill return to a sustainable and affordable level. However, there\r\nare practical difficulties as not all factors are within the Government's\r\ncontrol. For example, with the ongoing euro crisis and the risk\r\nof another US recession looming, global interest rates are likely\r\nto stay very low for quite some time. Low mortgage rates tend to\r\nboost demand to an abnormal level. But we do have considerable influence\r\nespecially over the HDB market. We are proactively tackling the\r\nproblem but we need time to allow the measures to work. We cannot\r\ncreate new flats overnight.

We are building 50,000 units of HDB flats in the\r\nfirst two years, as you have already read. This is equivalent to building\r\none whole new Ang Mo Kio Town. Beyond 2012, we have not decided\r\nyet on the scale of the BTO programme. If the demand remains strong,\r\nwe have the resources and the capacity to build more than 100,000\r\nHDB flats during this term of Government. And this may include starting\r\nBTO project launches in the proposed Bidadari Estate. Bidadari Estate\r\ncan potentially house up to 12,000 units. Further afield, we will\r\nstart planning the Tengah Town. This will be a new HDB Town with\r\npossibility of housing 56,000 units when fully developed. We will\r\nnot launch any BTO project in Tengah during this term of Government\r\nbut we will begin to put in the infrastructure like earthworks, roads,\r\ndrains, sewers and other facilities.

We have moderated price changes such that after\r\nadjusting for differences in location, amenities and other physical\r\nattributes, the May, July and September BTO prices were roughly\r\ncomparable to the prices of similar units in the April BTO launch.\r\nThe upcoming BTO launch next month will repeat this pattern. Newlyweds\r\neyeing new HDB flats do not need to worry that BTO price will run\r\nahead of their income. As long as construction costs do not rise\r\ndramatically, the BTO prices will stabilise. In this way, new HDB\r\nflats will always be affordable to the newlywed first-timers, provided\r\nthat their expectation is realistic. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-27236d81-5793-46ac-b1c1-e6a8265dc6e9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-27236d81-5793-46ac-b1c1-e6a8265dc6e9\"><!--a--></a>HDB builds a range of housing\r\ntypes, across different towns, precisely in order to offer a range\r\nof options for different income groups. Let me provide some illustrations. In\r\nlast month's BTO launch, the typical price of a 3-room flat in Sengkang\r\nwas $170,000. A newlywed couple earning $2,500 will get an Additional\r\nHousing Grant of $30,000, so the new flat will cost them $140,000.\r\nThis is less than five years of their annual income. A typical 25-year\r\nHDB loan for such a couple will see their monthly repayments fully covered\r\nby their CPF contributions. No cash needed. Another couple earning,\r\nsay, $4,500 could be eyeing a 4-room flat in Sengkang, where the\r\ntypical price is $280,000. They will get an Additional Housing Grant\r\nof $10,000. The flat will cost them $270,000, about five years of\r\ntheir annual income. A 25-year HDB loan will see their CPF contributions\r\ncovering most of the monthly mortgage repayments, with an out-of-pocket\r\npayment of about $60 a month. Another couple earning $6,000 could\r\nbe eyeing a 5-room flat in Sengkang, where the typical price is\r\n$350,000. This is also about five years of their annual income.\r\nA 25-year HDB loan will see their monthly repayments almost fully\r\ncovered by their CPF, with an out-of-pocket payment of about $50\r\na month. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 268</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f7f9fd4c-50fe-44ec-833a-91e852c4a38b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-f7f9fd4c-50fe-44ec-833a-91e852c4a38b\"><!--a--></a>These are realistic illustrations,\r\nquoting statistics of typical buyers of our HDB flats.

We can expect further improvement\r\nin the next couple of years, as new rental blocks become available.\r\nSeparately, I am reviewing the rental structure. Rentals are heavily\r\nsubsidised for the needy. For those earning $800 or below, they\r\npay a nominal rent of about $30 a month. Emeritus Senior Minister\r\nGoh told me about tenants who worked to raise their income, only\r\nto see their extra income going mostly to HDB through higher rental.\r\nAnd he has a point.

But I am aware that there are other groups of home\r\nbuyers: the singles, the second-timers, the upgraders, the downgraders.\r\nI will attend to them more fully in due course.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a50397d9-c645-45f8-8e23-084123c5e6d9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-a50397d9-c645-45f8-8e23-084123c5e6d9\"><!--a--></a>Meanwhile, because all the\r\nhousing segments are inter-linked, our solutions to help the newlywed\r\nfirst-timers will also help to moderate the other market segments.\r\nFor example, since we started the larger BTO launches, the number\r\nand the proportion of first-timers in the HDB resale market have\r\ndeclined significantly. This has reduced the competition among the\r\nbuyers in the HDB resale market. More importantly, as we progressively\r\nclear the outstanding demand from the first-timers, we will be able\r\nto move to the next step of addressing the needs of the second-timers.\r\nWe estimate that there are about 16,000 first-timer families still\r\nwaiting to buy a new HDB flat, and each year brings in 15,000 new\r\napplicants.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-20e78b5b-1df5-40b1-9e87-76326077c72b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-20e78b5b-1df5-40b1-9e87-76326077c72b\"><!--a--></a>If the estimates are correct,\r\nthen at some time next year, we can begin to better meet the needs\r\nof the HDB second-timers. Currently, only 5% of BTO flats are kept\r\nfor second-timers, even though they make up 40% of BTO applicants.\r\nIt is my hope that in a year's time, we can raise the percentage\r\nallocation for second-timers to improve their chances of getting\r\na flat. In turn, this will further reduce the demand in the HDB\r\nresale market. By reducing the demand on the HDB resale market,\r\nresale prices should also begin to moderate, benefiting other home\r\nbuyers, like the singles. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-813e22e3-e9e9-4e42-b8a5-cede47983032\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-813e22e3-e9e9-4e42-b8a5-cede47983032\"><!--a--></a>As for private housing,\r\nthey make up 23% of the housing market.

I rise to support the motion. In the past three\r\ndays, we have debated many issues to do with the well-being of Singaporeans.\r\nI would like to address now an issue that provides the underlying\r\nfoundation for us to pursue progress \u2013 the safety and security of\r\nSingapore. And, specifically, how the Internal Security Act (ISA) has\r\nallowed us to deal swiftly and effectively with threats to Singapore\r\nand keep us secure. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d6abd4af-b8ac-4240-b060-74957c9f2806\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-d6abd4af-b8ac-4240-b060-74957c9f2806\"><!--a--></a>The Singapore Internal Security\r\nAct (ISA) has its roots in preventive detention laws introduced\r\nby the British colonial government to tackle serious threats to\r\nsocial and political security in Malaya. After Independence, the\r\nISA remained a law in a sovereign Singapore and was important in\r\nenabling the Government to continue to counter national security\r\nthreats to our young nation. The ISA empowers the Government to address\r\nthreats to national security not just through preventive detention,\r\nbut also other measures like the imposition of curfews to deal with\r\ncivil disorder.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c53ec03a-24bb-4121-8cc1-9a4ba34e858f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-c53ec03a-24bb-4121-8cc1-9a4ba34e858f\"><!--a--></a>While the ISA provides considerable\r\npowers to deal with threats to security, it also contains important\r\nsafeguards which have been enhanced over time. An Advisory Board\r\nchaired by a Supreme Court Judge reviews all detentions under the\r\nISA. In 1991, the ISA was amended to give the Elected President\r\nveto powers such that where the Advisory Board recommends the release\r\nof any person, that person cannot be detained or further detained\r\nby the Government without the President's concurrence. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-422100d1-98c6-4526-9c29-7f9d190709d5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-422100d1-98c6-4526-9c29-7f9d190709d5\"><!--a--></a>Determining what is a security\r\nthreat to Singapore that requires the use of the ISA is a judgement.\r\nThis judgement must be made by the elected Government of the day,\r\nat the given time and based on the situation at hand. The ISA allows\r\nan overall assessment of the threat posed by a person to be presented\r\nand considered in totality, unlike a criminal case that is tried\r\nbefore the courts which consider only specific acts directly related\r\nto that charge. The ISA thus allows the Government to act quickly\r\nto prevent a threat from developing into something very serious\r\nsuch as a bombing; or to stem an organised pattern of subversion\r\nwhich promotes civil disturbances and disorder. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-96b984e2-ef3b-4d16-bff8-5e2b4d58455e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-96b984e2-ef3b-4d16-bff8-5e2b4d58455e\"><!--a--></a>The Government needed to\r\nuse the ISA from the 1960s till the late 1980s to counter the Communist\r\nParty of Malaya (CPM). In the 1990s it was rarely used, except in\r\na handful of espionage cases. But the ISA proved critical after\r\n11 September 2001 to protect us from global Jihadist terrorism.\r\nLet me take Members briefly through these three periods to illustrate\r\nhow the ISA has safeguarded our security against the evolving security\r\nthreats. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6280865b-301b-4464-9ebb-b2d5b456c175\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-6280865b-301b-4464-9ebb-b2d5b456c175\"><!--a--></a>From the 1960s right through\r\nto the late 1980s, the ISA was used mainly to counter the serious\r\nthreat posed by the CPM and the underground satellites or fraternal organisations\r\nof the CPM. The CPM was determined to violently overthrow the democratically\r\nelected governments of the day. Communism was on the march world-wide.\r\nIn South East Asia, every country faced a communist insurgency;\r\nand in Indo-China, countries fell like dominoes under communist\r\nregimes. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 271</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c75db0b2-e921-4e4d-8964-c1c6ecd90388\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-c75db0b2-e921-4e4d-8964-c1c6ecd90388\"><!--a--></a>For the CPM, Singapore and\r\nWest Malaysia were always one entity called \"Malaya\".

One prong was armed\r\nstruggle by an insurgent CPM guerrilla army hiding in the jungle.\r\nThe other prong was mass struggle relying on covert infiltration\r\nand subversion of open and legal organisations to create a communist \"united\r\nfront\" (CUF). This \"united front\" would incite and stage illegal\r\nstrikes, riots and civil strife, to de-stabilise the Government\r\nand the State. Given Singapore's urban geography, the preferred\r\ntactic was the \"united front\".

But\r\nunder our system, she felt constrained trying to conform to a rigid\r\nregime expecting standard answers. With a class size of over 40\r\nstudents, her mother had to put her through tuition to keep pace\r\nwith the class. Jazlina started to lose self-confidence and told\r\nher mother that \"maybe I am not so smart after all\". At Secondary\r\n3, she was streamed into a subject combination that was not her\r\npassion. After fighting the system for a few more months, the family\r\nput her back into their own school in Thailand. Jazlina blossomed\r\nagain. She now represents Thailand in international debating competitions, where\r\nshe has won prizes. At this year's iGCSE Examinations, Jazlina aced\r\nall her subjects and scored 100% in two subjects, including for\r\nthe subject that she was not selected to take in Singapore. Her\r\nmother shared that had they not brought her back into a more nurturing\r\nenvironment, her confidence would have plunged further.

Instead of being obsessed about picking out winners, education\r\nshould make winners out of the ordinary. We may have done well in the\r\npast.

But we have\r\nseen over the last few years that there are big problems in the\r\nthree areas that I have just mentioned: housing, transport and healthcare.\r\nMy premise for this is that when you leave things to the free market,\r\nthings do not catch up and people may be unwilling to take risks because\r\nhaving unsold flats, for example, does not look too good, and you\r\nwill be questioned by the Auditor-General and so on. So, yes, on\r\nthe DBSS, I am aware that it is not a big portion. I am citing it\r\nas a case that when you go too far and let the private economy take\r\nover the running, then there will be at some point in time when\r\nthe profit elements from the private developers will set in and\r\npush things up. I do recognise that HDB provides the bulk of housing.\r\nWhat I am saying is that there is not enough drive by the Government\r\nto take a bigger responsibility, to take bigger risks to absorb\r\nmore of these things, to plan the capacity ahead of time, even if\r\nit means that it might not look so good on the books.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-7c955bd7-c467-4985-82e5-ed474219100c\">\r\n               <a name=\"president-address__id-7c955bd7-c467-4985-82e5-ed474219100c\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e4ae349f-2b4e-4bce-bf84-e7269e21e71d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-e4ae349f-2b4e-4bce-bf84-e7269e21e71d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">BG [NS] Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr\r\nSpeaker, I think it is important to make this quite clear.

The current Ministerial Committee\r\non Ageing, chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, is conducting\r\na review on preparing our society for population ageing. MCYS is\r\na key Ministry contributing to this work. One of our main tasks\r\nis on enhancing our home care and community-based services. This\r\nis to enable our senior citizens to \"age in place\" in familiar surroundings and\r\nwith their friends. Another key thrust is to promote active ageing,\r\nso that our senior citizens can live healthy and active lives within\r\nthe community. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f1b07230-424f-44c2-b504-3ccabae12ce8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-f1b07230-424f-44c2-b504-3ccabae12ce8\"><!--a--></a>In addition, we must do\r\nmore for senior citizens who are poor, especially those with no\r\nfamilies. Strong social relationships are crucial for the elderly,\r\nespecially those who live alone or in poor health. Friendships,\r\ncommunal routines, simple chit-chat and even occasional mahjong\r\nsessions can actually prevent social isolation, and also encourage them\r\nto become part of the community.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-98204c49-c316-4408-b230-1d7c46328de9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-98204c49-c316-4408-b230-1d7c46328de9\"><!--a--></a>Indeed, we should help our\r\nvulnerable seniors to be closely connected to service providers\r\nand the community. Currently, the Seniors Activity Centres serve\r\nthis role. They reach out to vulnerable seniors in HDB rental flats\r\nand encourage them to interact with other seniors. All of them,\r\nwhether vulnerable or not, can then bond and support one another.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-dfe0105e-39d9-426a-8e75-72a9593166ab\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-dfe0105e-39d9-426a-8e75-72a9593166ab\"><!--a--></a>Next year, MCYS will increase\r\nthe funding for these Centres from 50% to 60%.

Both camps have guarded their\r\nterritories firmly, not giving way to the other side.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-37e5d079-7e03-4370-b811-b407366b4ab4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-37e5d079-7e03-4370-b811-b407366b4ab4\"><!--a--></a>The views of the opposition\r\nparties are mainly directed at Government policies and directions,\r\nand the side effects of the implementation of these policies.

Since\r\npolicies are not perfect, the ruling party and the opposition party\r\nMPs have the right to point out the mistakes, make suggestions for\r\nthe Government to consider. As the saying goes, \"If there are mistakes,\r\none should correct it; if there are no mistakes, one should be complimented\".\r\nIt is the responsibility of the Government to listen carefully,\r\nanalyse in detail and execute carefully. But I must point out that\r\ncriticising policies is not the exclusive right of the opposition\r\nparties. Sometimes, when the backbenchers of the ruling party \"scold\"\r\nthe Government, they are even more \"fierce\" than opposition party\r\nMPs. It is this principle and attitude of placing \"logic before kinship\"\r\nthat is one of the factors contributing to Singapore's success.\r\nThe backbenchers of the ruling party are not merely \"yes-men\". </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-650ae61d-85cd-4705-a08e-cd2f8201c40a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-650ae61d-85cd-4705-a08e-cd2f8201c40a\"><!--a--></a>After listening to the debate\r\nin the last two days, I think the views expressed by MP for Aljunied\r\nGRC, Mr Chen Show Mao, have indeed brought about a fresh style.\r\nActually, I feel that at the end of his speech, we should give him\r\nwarmer applause. He quoted a Confucius saying, \"Gentlemen promote\r\nharmony inspite of differences\". And he has used another quotation\r\nfrom Confucius, to encourage the Government to be more tolerant.\r\nThese words resound well and I agree. And, in fact, this has always\r\nbeen the policy of the PAP. \"The sea accepts water from a hundred\r\nrivers\", the ruling party has left no stone unturned in discovering\r\nnew talents, and look for the best with capability to serve our\r\nnation. In the current Government and Parliament, there are Ministers\r\nand MPs who, before entering politics, disagreed with the Government's\r\ndirections and policies, and would voice their views openly, for\r\nexample, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,\r\nformer Minister Mr Raymond Lim, etc. Furthermore, the Government\r\namended the Constitution to allow Non-Constituency Members of Parliament\r\nand Nominated MPs to enter Parliament. So, we can see that the Government\r\nhas adopted the attitude that \"tolerance brings about greatness\"\r\nand to \"seek common ground while accepting differences\". </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 294</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b77ecfc9-e6ea-43bc-8719-60755c221d7a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-b77ecfc9-e6ea-43bc-8719-60755c221d7a\"><!--a--></a>Mr Chen, besides quoting\r\nfrom ancient history, has also quoted Mr Chen Duxiu, \"if there is\r\nno party outside the party, this is emperor's mentality\", to explain\r\nhis views. With regard to this quote, I have a different interpretation.\r\nIn the literal sense, the meaning of this quote is, \"If there is\r\nonly one party and no other parties, it is a feudalistic imperial\r\nmindset\". In today's Singapore, besides the People's Action Party,\r\nthere are more than 20 other political parties. Including Mr Chen\r\nShow Mao, all of them have the right to express a different viewpoint.\r\nIn fact, this is a manifestation of our society's tolerance. So\r\nI believe that a better way to describe the political system of\r\nSingapore would be to say, \"Parties outside the party, this is democratic\r\nmindset\". But, since Mr Chen admired Mr Chen Duxiu, I would like\r\nto share with him some background of Mr Chen Duxiu. Mr Chen Duxiu\r\nwas a former party leader in the Chinese Communist Party, but when\r\nhis personal view deviated from the party's direction, he sought\r\nout people within the party who sympathised with him and formed\r\nhis clique. In the end, he was expelled from his party. As to who\r\nwas right and who was wrong, it is difficult for outsiders like\r\nus to know. However, Mr Chen Duxiu and other communist party members,\r\nperhaps, were lacking in tolerance for other views, and this was\r\nthe reason why they could not tolerate each other, and this is a\r\nlesson we must learn from. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b146fd1d-9221-4e5f-8f50-2854b3ca0b35\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-b146fd1d-9221-4e5f-8f50-2854b3ca0b35\"><!--a--></a>Singapore is a small island\r\ncountry, what we have today was achieved due to the combined effort\r\nof all Singaporeans and our willingness to work together, to advance together.\r\nParticularly, with the turbulent and uncertain international political\r\nand economic situation, we need to strengthen our core competitiveness,\r\ninstead of having different opinions, and veer away from the objective\r\nof unity, as this may lead to division amongst our people. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-131513b7-c54f-4ff8-966a-d8e6b46d5e6d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-131513b7-c54f-4ff8-966a-d8e6b46d5e6d\"><!--a--></a>In the Qing dynasty, during\r\nthe period under Emperor Jiaqing, a governor of Yunnan and Guizhou\r\nby the name of Zhao Shentian wrote a couplet, \"To be in politics,\r\nthere is no need to talk too much, but you must always examine yourself\r\nand overcome your limitations; As an official, you must be aware\r\nof the big picture and be concerned about the people's livelihood.\"\r\nIts emphasis is on the fact that those in politics do not need to talk\r\ntoo much, but must be able to see the big picture.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0cc0ee57-c609-49ce-b84d-449c1c973a52\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-0cc0ee57-c609-49ce-b84d-449c1c973a52\"><!--a--></a>I really appreciate this\r\ncouplet, for the spirit it manifests.

Do better things and exercise self-discipline, not\r\npursue self-interest when considering all matters. Think of the\r\nbig picture, and never forget the harmful effects of wrong policies\r\non people's livelihood. As MP Chen says, the ruling party does not\r\nhave special rights to be patriots. For the love of our country,\r\nregardless of whether one is the ruling party or opposition party, everyone\r\nshould place national interest above all else, and regard promoting\r\nnational cohesiveness as the main priority. Hence, I am most willing\r\nto share this couplet with both ruling party MPs and opposition\r\nparty MPs the spirit that it manifests should be the aim that all\r\nof us pursue together.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 295</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-547d0137-f67c-4926-8174-a6ebbeaf47ee\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-547d0137-f67c-4926-8174-a6ebbeaf47ee\"><!--a--></a>In addition, MP Chen also\r\nmentioned that he would like to emulate Wei Zheng of the Tang Dynasty.\r\nWei Zheng is one of the extraordinary Prime Ministers in the thousand-year\r\nhistory of China. He helped Emperor Tang Tai Zong create the historically renowned\r\n\"era of Zhenguan\". MP Chen has great ambition to emulate Wei Zheng\r\nand that is admirable. But I believe that MP Chen should also realise\r\nwhy Wei Zheng is special. Not only did he have special views, he\r\nwas also fearless and he did not work for self-interest. I would\r\nlike to talk about a story to illustrate the uniqueness of Wei Zheng.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6cb7b4fb-edb1-4a8c-885a-9a67a6c09830\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-6cb7b4fb-edb1-4a8c-885a-9a67a6c09830\"><!--a--></a>It is written in classical\r\nChinese, so I seek your tolerance. In the second year of Zhenguan,\r\nEmperor Tang Tai Zong asked Wei Zheng, \"How do you define an enlightened\r\nEmperor? How do you define an ignorant Emperor?\". Wei Zheng answered, \"The\r\nenlightened Emperor listens to all sides; the ignorant Emperor listens\r\nonly to one side.\" What this story means is, one day, Emperor Tang\r\nTai Zong asked Wei Zheng, what does it mean to be a wise Emperor?\r\nWei Zheng replied and said that a wise Emperor is one who is willing\r\nto listen to all views, while the Emperor who listens to only a\r\nsmall group of close aides is unwise. So there are two principles\r\nhere. Although this is advice given to Emperor Tang Tai Zong, Wei\r\nZheng himself put it into practice as well. As a dutiful and responsible\r\nofficial, one must ensure that one is fair and does not listen to one\r\nside. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a645fa4e-3312-4f27-964b-13bccc63211e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-a645fa4e-3312-4f27-964b-13bccc63211e\"><!--a--></a>So since MP Chen is using\r\nWei Zheng as an example that he would like to emulate, when his\r\nview is different from that of his party, I hope he will be able\r\nto look at the big picture and express his view, and not be a \"yes-men\"\r\nto his party.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-64aea9f2-7d7e-4344-b811-63b8b205e7c7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-64aea9f2-7d7e-4344-b811-63b8b205e7c7\"><!--a--></a>There is a saying by Confucius,\r\n\"Do not do unto others what you do not wish others to do unto you\".\r\nWhilst discussing the issue of tolerance, may I be bold enough to amend\r\nthis phrase slightly, and say that \"what you would wish, do it to\r\nothers\". If what you wish is other people's desire, then do it for\r\nothers, that is real tolerance.

First, cost of food. The recent\r\nannouncement by Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on reviving the building\r\nof hawker centres is indeed a welcoming move. As there are more\r\nand more Singaporeans eating out, the addition of more hawker centres\r\nwill undoubtedly give Singaporeans more choices and, hopefully, more\r\neconomical food.

No\r\nsubletting is allowed. This will provide Singaporeans with jobs\r\nand give them the opportunity to own their business and, at the\r\nsame time, a way to ensure that our authentic dishes will not become\r\nextinct. Besides that, the design of hawker centres should incorporate\r\nthe designated place for patrons of hawker centres to return the\r\nused bowls and cutlery. This habit has been practised in schools\r\nand army camps, but why is it not practised when we go out into\r\nthe workforce? I would think that it is because of the design of\r\nthe hawker centres.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0e93e2d6-9424-48d7-9be2-712979782521\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-0e93e2d6-9424-48d7-9be2-712979782521\"><!--a--></a>Next, cost of housing.

Despite the \"Teach less, Learn more\" initiative,\r\nmany parents feel that the schools are teaching anything but less.\r\nFeedback suggests that students in primary school are learning subjects\r\nwhich should be taught in secondary schools. The common complaint\r\nis that students are given far too many assignments or homework\r\nat a young age.

Why do they need additional help from the tuition\r\ncentre? Would teachers be prepared to conduct more remedial classes\r\nfor the weaker students? Could MOE set as a goal that no additional tuition\r\nshould be required save in exceptional circumstances?

Values like kindness, consideration for\r\nothers, being grateful and humility \u2013 if these values are properly imbibed\r\nin our students, they are demonstrated by our teachers in schools\r\neveryday, then these values will stay with our students for the\r\nrest of their lives.

But there has been frequent feedback that foreign\r\nstudents who receive scholarships to study in Singapore take advantage\r\nof the system. Some occupy scarce places in our schools and aim\r\nfor a free ride to universities in other countries. In contrast,\r\nSingaporeans have to fight hard for limited places in good schools\r\nand in our local universities. Singaporeans who cannot secure places\r\nin our local universities are naturally unhappy that they have to\r\npay high fees for overseas university education when there are places\r\ntaken up by foreign students who do not appreciate these places.\r\nSo, these Singapore students feel that the excessive intake of foreign\r\nstudents has taken away the limited places that could be given to\r\nthem. I urge MOE to gradually reduce the number of foreign students\r\nto not more than 10% of each class in our schools or universities.\r\nAnd this is especially so for popular faculties like Medical school\r\nand Law school. This would allow entry for more Singaporeans.

Minister Vivian is not here but I am not\r\nappealing to him, as I have three hawker centres in my constituency.\r\nBut I feel that hawker centres can help to keep costs of living\r\nlower because the cooked food or market produce sold can be priced\r\nlower. May I urge the Government to accelerate the building of the\r\nhawker centres. I also repeat my call to the Government not to tender\r\nthese stalls at market prices, instead allocate them at subsidised\r\nrent to the lower income.

There have been times when we, as a labour movement,\r\ndisagree with our tripartite partners, especially when we echo and\r\nadvocate the concerns and pains of our workers and unions.

Behind this diversity of views\r\nis a unity of purpose and vision because our tripartite partners\r\n\u2013 the Government, employers and unions \u2013 work in cooperation to shape\r\nSingapore's future together, forging consensus in developing strategies\r\nand taking action to achieve sustainable national growth and development\r\nfor the benefit of workers, employers and society.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1c58452e-1a70-42f5-bf45-3c2d1074c217\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-1c58452e-1a70-42f5-bf45-3c2d1074c217\"><!--a--></a>I joined the labour movement\r\nnine-and-a-half years ago in 2002. As an Industrial Relations Officer,\r\nI had the opportunity to witness for myself two major bouts of retrenchments,\r\nonce in 2003 during the SARS outbreak and the other during the subprime\r\ncrisis in 2008. During the 2003 downturn, many rank and file workers\r\nlost their jobs. I saw for myself how SIA and SATS staff, and the\r\nhotel and services industries being badly affected during the SARS\r\noutbreak. I saw workers who lost their jobs and had their wages\r\ncut. I recalled NTUC and our affiliated unions helping thousands\r\nto undergo training and many for career switches. I also recalled\r\nNTUC acting as a surrogate employer and helping almost 200 tourist\r\nguides to undergo skills redevelopment programme and upgrading as\r\ntourist arrivals came to a standstill and their incomes halted.\r\nDuring the end 2008 downturn, we had swift measures from a closely-knit\r\ntripartite effort to manage excess manpower and to upturn the downturn. We\r\nbounced back quickly. Thanks to the resolute efforts and tenacity\r\nof purpose by our tripartite partners from the unions, employers\r\nand Government.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 309</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c0e263d6-5cdc-4d0b-b497-590f01bd7b11\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-c0e263d6-5cdc-4d0b-b497-590f01bd7b11\"><!--a--></a>Employers took pains to\r\ncut costs to save jobs. Unions and workers braced themselves to\r\npersevere and stood by their companies as the Government rolled\r\nout the resilience package tapping into our hard earned reserves.\r\nAlthough we bounced back very quickly by end 2009, that period also\r\nsaw many job losses and institutions like several banks laying off\r\nstaff often unannounced, and not reported publicly. During the 2008\r\ndownturn, I saw for myself increasingly more professionals, managers\r\nand executives, hereinafter referred to as PMEs for short, facing\r\nretrenchments. With the uncertain global economic conditions and\r\noutlook, we have to brace ourselves. In fact, just two weeks ago,\r\nwe saw the first signs of the uncertain market conditions with the laying\r\noff of about 220 workers of United Test and Assembly. I am told\r\nalmost 100 of them were PMEs, a group of them are currently undergoing\r\nskills training at Next U, the PME training arm of NTUC Learning\r\nHub. They are re-skilling in various areas of computing such as\r\nautocad and host of other skills as many of those retrenched have engineering\r\nbackground. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-005a18f6-a75c-43d1-8661-54f9dbbcc5cf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-005a18f6-a75c-43d1-8661-54f9dbbcc5cf\"><!--a--></a>The Ministry of Manpower\r\nhad released an occasional paper last week and highlighted that\r\nthe Singapore workforce has about half who belonged to this category called\r\nthe PMETs. I would prefer to use the term \"PMEs\", as the \"T\" refers\r\nto technical officers and technicians who are these days generally\r\nconsidered rank and file workers. Since the Opening of Parliament,\r\nI have also posed several questions to ascertain the extent and\r\naccurate composition of the PME group of workers and the current demographic\r\nand industry profile, including their employment and unemployment\r\nrates which I hope, when answered, will throw more light to this\r\ngrowing segment of our working population. Based on extrapolation\r\nof the current labour market survey and reports, I am quite sure\r\nwe would have about a third of our workers falling within this PME\r\nclassification.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-869372e7-d8a7-41f0-8938-e738f8d18b92\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-869372e7-d8a7-41f0-8938-e738f8d18b92\"><!--a--></a>With rising affluence and\r\neducational qualifications and with a large proportion of our people\r\nembarking on tertiary education and entering the jobs in managerial\r\nand executive positions, it would not be long before this group\r\nof PMEs formed the greater majority of our workforce. What this\r\nmeans is that we need to focus and direct our efforts at all levels\r\nand at all fronts to support their personal growth and advancement, protect\r\ntheir welfare and interest and assist them when they need help,\r\noften times, well before they start asking for it. Our PME group\r\nof workers' concerns and challenges fall into various categories\r\naccording to the life stage they are in and their nature of work.\r\nIn the first instance, I share my parliamentary colleague, Ms Low\r\nYen Ling's concern of those who are aged 40 years and above. From\r\nMOM's data, it has been clearly demonstrated that this segment requires\r\na much longer period of time before they gain employment after retrenchment.\r\nIn fact, I know of a resident who obtained a First Class Honours\r\nin engineering from NUS and worked as an engineer in a large MNC\r\nbefore he was retrenched during the last downturn in 2008. He was\r\n40 years old at that time. He was out of job for more than nine\r\nmonths and finally landed a job in the Civil Service at much less\r\nthan half his previous pay. He was fortunate in that his wife was\r\nworking and that they had no major debts. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-22283b9e-f1f5-496d-b8e0-27d28f9c2431\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-22283b9e-f1f5-496d-b8e0-27d28f9c2431\"><!--a--></a>What I am sharing is a real\r\nconcern amongst many Singaporean PMEs. This is regardless of whether\r\nthey are earning $3,000, $6,000 or $9,000 per month. Many are already\r\nsaddled with mortgages and vehicle loans. Those with families will\r\nbe having young children and many have to support aged parents.\r\nTo further exacerbate their burdens, many of these PMEs who are\r\nin their 40s would be an only child or have only one other sibling,\r\nand they were born during the time when measures were kicked in\r\nto get families to stop at two. Being retrenched is one thing, finding\r\na job after that is going to be the next hurdle that we have to\r\novercome after picking themselves up.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 310</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2fbdfd3c-9328-43e9-8dee-c98022ebc4f8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-2fbdfd3c-9328-43e9-8dee-c98022ebc4f8\"><!--a--></a>Looking back at the past\r\ndecade, such economic swings are no longer once in 10 years like\r\ntraditional economists used to articulate. I worry, and I repeat\r\nagain, I worry for this group of PMEs at the next downturn. I am\r\nwell aware that the Employment and Employability Institute has already\r\nstarted regular career fairs for PMEs since the last downturn and\r\nis ramping up on such fairs. Due to a very diverse and often specialised nature\r\nof PME jobs and PME interest, the amount of resources to upskill\r\nand reskill the PME and place him or her in the PME job requires\r\na significantly larger amount of resources as compared to training\r\nand placing a worker in a rank and file job.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9713bb0a-661f-4c62-b7f7-d6f7fec5c70b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-9713bb0a-661f-4c62-b7f7-d6f7fec5c70b\"><!--a--></a>Many of our young these\r\ndays are equipped with IT certificates, diplomas, degrees and postgraduate\r\nqualifications. Many of them start off their first career or job\r\nas executive or skilled professional. What do you think this segment\r\nof our PMEs is looking for? During a series of focus group discussions\r\nwhich I had with some PMEs, they are looking for good opportunities,\r\ngood jobs, good career advancement, good treatment by employers,\r\ngood worklife balance besides good remuneration. They also want\r\nto be well protected against unfair treatment, termination and job\r\nlosses. Career progression and reconciling job satisfaction with\r\npersonal aspirations have been a common concern. In the recent figures\r\njust released from the Council of Private Education which tracks student\r\nmembers in private schools, it showed student enrolment had reached\r\n146,000 by the middle of this year for which 113,000 are Singaporeans.\r\nMost of them are aged below 30 years and diploma holders. This is\r\nin comparison to about 45,000 Singaporeans pursuing undergraduate\r\ndegrees in our three local universities and the new Singapore Institute\r\nof Technology. With such large numbers graduating from private educational\r\nproviders such as Singapore Institute of Management, Management Development\r\nInstitute of Singapore, PSB Academy and other well-known providers\r\nin ties-up with foreign universities, the number of potential young\r\nPMEs entering the market or already in the market and upgrading\r\nthemselves in the coming years will certainly increase tremendously.\r\nMy serious worry for this group of young PMEs is whether there are\r\ngood jobs for them to fulfil their aspirations and ambitions. We\r\nare well aware of growth in sectors such as biomedical, research\r\nand development, clean energy and several other professional services.\r\nThe question is, whether these young PMEs have a passion or keenness\r\nto enter into some of these industries and whether employers will\r\naccept them with open arms.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3865c5ac-e307-4894-9523-a46c8c4a1da6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-3865c5ac-e307-4894-9523-a46c8c4a1da6\"><!--a--></a>For those who are keen and\r\nwilling to upgrade and upskill themselves through such private education\r\nproviders, many of whom are those who are unable to afford an overseas\r\neducation. Are there other avenues where these young people can\r\nobtain assistance from the Government? I am aware of the Workforce\r\nDevelopment Agency's Skills Training for Excellence Programme (STEP)\r\nwhich is outcome and industry based. However, many of these SIM\r\nand MDI students I spoke to, including some of my residents, hope\r\nto see the likes of UniSIM type of Government funding, or the likes\r\nof the Edusave Merit Bursary, or scholarships. In fact, last week,\r\nI chatted with one of my union leaders who is in his late 20s. He\r\nworks as a technician. He completed an undergraduate programme in\r\nBusiness Management with one of our top private education providers\r\nlast year. I asked him if he had received an enlargement of job\r\nscope or had his salary or job grade adjusted with his new degree\r\nqualification. He told me in a dismal, no. I believe there are many\r\nlike him, not just in the private sector but also in the public\r\nsector. This begets the issue of under-employment of our PMEs. Many\r\nlike this young union leader may have to move to another job to\r\nbe promoted to an Executive. Some stay on bitterly. This is not\r\na new phenomenon. Countries like the United States face similar\r\nchallenges. Lower jobs taken on by highly or over qualified PMEs,\r\nthereby causing severe under-employment. This is an area which I\r\nfeel we should take cognisance of despite the fact that we have\r\nrelatively low youth unemployment compared to many developed countries.\r\nWe should prepare ourselves.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 311</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a1f9adf9-2529-4dfc-bb32-788468ac8407\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-a1f9adf9-2529-4dfc-bb32-788468ac8407\"><!--a--></a>In the same vein, many PMEs\r\nbattle with having children and doing well or even keeping up with\r\ntheir careers at the same time.

The challenges of having to rush home before 7.00\r\npm to fetch or see their children; the plight of parents when their\r\nchild falls ill; the prospect of the centre being shut down due\r\nto an outbreak of disease and having to make unplanned childcare\r\narrangements, frighten many.

There have been concerns and\r\nfeedback from my union leaders, residents and Facebook friends about\r\nforeign PMEs competing and taking away jobs from Singaporean PMEs.\r\nWe do not doubt the need for foreign PMEs in certain specialised and\r\nniche industries.

In general, our Employment Act explicitly\r\nexcludes managers and executives in its scope of coverage. The Act\r\nwas amended on a few occasions since promulgation and updated to\r\noffer limited protection to lower-level executives. On 1 February\r\nthis year, the tripartite mediation process was introduced to cover\r\nunion members earning less than $4,500 for specific head of claims.\r\nTo date, the tripartite mediation panel has successfully mediated three\r\ncases involving executives with employment-related claims. The Manpower Ministry\r\nalso offers PMEs a voluntary mediation route. However, I am concerned\r\nabout the ambit and coverage of the Employment Act to PMEs. As our\r\nmedian salaries increase year after year and PMEs employment terms\r\nand contracts become increasingly complex, sometimes involving transnational\r\nand cross-border issues, I therefore ask this House how effective\r\nour current Employment Act has been in protecting the interest and\r\nproviding recourse to aggrieved PMEs. The meaning and intent of\r\nthe word \"executive\", which was provided in the Employment Act when\r\nit was first promulgated in 1968, and the meaning of \"executive\"\r\ntoday, 43 years later, I submit, surely, is dissimilar. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c7353e58-9037-4cf1-b005-9b0983b99c7c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-c7353e58-9037-4cf1-b005-9b0983b99c7c\"><!--a--></a>By the same token, we are\r\nincreasingly seeing an increase in what is commonly known as \"freelancers\".\r\nThey are independent contractors who do not fall squarely into an\r\nemployer/employee relationship and, therefore, not protected by\r\nour labour legislation. We see such workers in various sectors such\r\nas tourist guides, freelance trainers and those in the creative\r\narts and entertainment industry.

Over the\r\nyears, I myself have counselled many female colleagues who struggle\r\nwith the choice of staying at home or continue working, usually\r\nafter having children. They are typically at the prime of their\r\ncareers. They feel a strong sense of guilt of not having enough\r\ntime for the family, yet they feel a strong sense of loss for giving\r\nup the career they have built and the financial security that comes\r\nwith it. Juggling work and family can be a delicate balance. I remember\r\nmy own days as a young mother, rushing home to see my sons during\r\nlunch break, that was the best reward for my working day, and that\r\nwas usually only 15 minutes before I had to dash off again to drive\r\nback to the office for the next meeting. Being away on business\r\ntrips was often a very miserable experience.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1991fed8-cba3-4ffa-8b96-2d715431db87\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-1991fed8-cba3-4ffa-8b96-2d715431db87\"><!--a--></a>Sir, in modern Singapore,\r\nwomen who choose to work should be supported so that they can work\r\nand take care of their families at the same time. But in order for\r\nthis to happen, they need ready access to child and eldercare services,\r\nthey need their husbands as joint partners in raising their families,\r\nand they also need employers and the Government to adopt family-friendly\r\npolicies. We still have some way to go in providing these. For example,\r\ndespite the many discussions I followed in this House around flexi-work\r\narrangements, women here continue to struggle with the painful choice\r\nbetween full-time work or no work, as flexi-work and part-time work arrangements,\r\nincluding home-based work, are not readily available. Sixty one\r\npercent of women who are not working have indicated they would work\r\nif flexi- and part-time arrangements were made available. Sir, being\r\none of the most highly connected, technologically advanced countries,\r\nSingapore has all the natural levers to support flexi-work. Not\r\nleveraging this to enable women to stay in the workforce is truly\r\na missed opportunity.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 315</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-145c5d4e-204c-48bf-b99d-4e4497059b46\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-145c5d4e-204c-48bf-b99d-4e4497059b46\"><!--a--></a>In addition, more can be\r\ndone to help women to go back to work, especially those in the lower\r\nincome group, as this will mean helping their families with extra\r\nincome to improve living standards.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6ee768f3-4a13-4e42-97cc-143061e4ae38\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-6ee768f3-4a13-4e42-97cc-143061e4ae38\"><!--a--></a>NTUC's Back to Work programme\r\nhas helped 8,000 women return to the workforce, but there are still\r\nmore than 235,000 economically inactive women between the prime ages\r\nof 25-54 that could be re-inducted. I have met a number of female\r\nresidents who are frustrated of not being able to even land a job\r\ninterview despite pursuing numerous training programmes, having\r\ntaken some time off work. The reason is very simple: employers are\r\nnot confident about their ability to adapt to the work environment, especially\r\nolder women who have stopped work for some time. So, in many cases,\r\nthe employer's concerns have less to do with the applicant's relevant\r\nskills, but more about her fitting into the working environment.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-070a7e6c-fb16-4398-9b85-559c2535de05\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-070a7e6c-fb16-4398-9b85-559c2535de05\"><!--a--></a>Sir, taking inspiration\r\nfrom the successful Jobs Credit Scheme, can we not consider a special\r\ngrant to encourage employers to offer re-induction to women returning\r\nto the workforce? Under this scheme, which I will call the Re-entry\r\nScheme for the purposes of this discussion, companies can obtain\r\na grant from the Government for a limited period of time, perhaps\r\nthree to six months, for hiring women returning to the workforce.\r\nThis is to ease the re-induction of women into the workplace by\r\nimmersing themselves in the operating rhythm and orientating themselves\r\nto the rigour of a new job. The Re-entry Scheme will help offset\r\nthe employer's cost for on-the-job training for these women as well\r\nas any redesign of work arrangements necessary. Yes, this will be\r\nan investment by the Government, but this is an investment that\r\nis completely \u2013 completely \u2013 targeted to developing the vocational\r\nskills of the worker for the task she is already hired to do, rather\r\nthan training given in the hope she will find a job.

In the meantime, our fertility rate has slid to a historic\r\nlow of 1.16. This contrasts starkly with countries such as Norway,\r\nwhere gender equality and female friendly employment policies make\r\nit easier for women to raise families whilst enjoying successful\r\ncareers and financial security. Norway's women labour participation\r\nis at a high of 80%, and not surprisingly, the fertility rate at\r\na respectable 1.96.

How can we be sure that employers adopt a \"Singaporean\r\nfirst\" policy by trying their best to employ local talent before\r\nhiring foreign talent? Where employers claim that it is not possible\r\nto hire a Singaporean because of the nature of the job, how can\r\nwe be sure that those particular jobs are correctly specified or\r\npaid? If those skills are indeed so rare, how can we persuade employers\r\nto train Singaporeans to fill those jobs? Sir, I believe these are\r\nvery valid and important questions and we must find a solution to\r\naddress them in a systematic and thoughtful way. Many countries,\r\neven the Gulf States, which welcome foreigners to supplement locals,\r\nhave put in place measures that deal with the issues highlighted.\r\nThis allows the admission of high quality foreign talent without adversely\r\naffecting the job opportunities and wages of locals.

Instead, the initiatives discussed above\r\nmay be introduced in a gradual and phased manner, so as to allow businesses\r\nto adapt to the changes.
