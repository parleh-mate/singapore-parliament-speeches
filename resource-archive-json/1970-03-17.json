While for a majority of  owner-occupied  properties the annual values  have  been\r\n\r\nrevised by 100 per cent to 150 per cent, there are\r\n\r\ninstances  where  the  annual  values  have   been\r\n\r\nrevised  by 250 per cent.

Mr  Ferris\r\n\r\narrived  in  Singapore on 20th October,  1969,  in\r\n\r\nresponse to an application by my Ministry  for  an\r\n\r\nexpert   on   Stock  Exchange  problems   to   the\r\n\r\nInternational  Executive  Service  Corps  on  13th\r\n\r\nJune, 1969. He reported on 11th November, 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As will be apparent when the report is published,\r\n\r\nMr  Ferris  has made a penetrating study  of  the\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange in Singapore and Malaysia, despite\r\n\r\nthe shortness of his stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made a large number of recommendations and\r\n\r\nhas  undoubtedly uncovered the weakness of trading\r\n\r\npractices  in  the  local  stock  exchange.  As  a\r\n\r\nmeasure  designed  to dampen speculation,  he  has\r\n\r\nrecommended the imposition of margins and a higher\r\n\r\nrate  of commission on delayed dealings. In  order\r\n\r\nto  strengthen the financial position of brokerage\r\n\r\nfirms,  he  has  recommended the incorporation  of\r\n\r\npartnerships as companies and the institution of a\r\n\r\nsystem  of  surprise audits by a special  pool  of\r\n\r\nauditors approved by the Exchange and agreed to by\r\n\r\nthe Government, as well as regular inspections  by\r\n\r\na  trained  inspectorate employed by the Exchange.\r\n\r\nThe  report  contains  recommendations  aimed   at\r\n\r\nimproving  the educational standard and  technical\r\n\r\ncompetence  of brokers, remisers and dealers.  The\r\n\r\nFerris Report also proposes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvarious   measures   aimed  at  disciplining   the\r\n\r\ndirectors  of  listed companies and  reducing  the\r\n\r\nadvantage  that  \"insiders\" might  have  over  the\r\n\r\ninvesting public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have distributed copies of the report to the\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange  Committee and have  held  several\r\n\r\ndiscussions  both with the Committee  as  well  as\r\n\r\nmembers of the larger brokerage firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While discussions were in progress, trouble broke\r\n\r\nout in the Stock Exchange over Federal Paper. This\r\n\r\nwas  the  result  of weaknesses which  the  Ferris\r\n\r\nReport had pin-pointed, in particular the practice\r\n\r\nof  allowing delayed transactions to be  conducted\r\n\r\nwithout requiring a cash deposit to cover  a  part\r\n\r\nof the value of contracts. This practice, known as\r\n\r\n\"free-riding\", undoubtedly contributed to the ease\r\n\r\nwith  which speculative attacks can be mounted  in\r\n\r\nthe Exchange.

To begin with,\r\n\r\nthere were hitherto five classes of markets, three\r\n\r\nin  the city area (Classes A, B and C), and two in\r\n\r\nthe  rural  area  (Classes A and  B).  There  were\r\n\r\ndifferent  rates  of fees for  each  of  the  five\r\n\r\nclasses  of markets, and in each class there  were\r\n\r\nup  to 37 categories of articles of sale with each\r\n\r\ncategory  being charged a different rate  of  fee.\r\n\r\nFurther,  even  within  each  category,  different\r\n\r\nrates were charged, depending upon the size of the\r\n\r\nstall  or pitch in the particular market. In  this\r\n\r\nrespect there were no less than 20 different sizes\r\n\r\nof stalls and pitches in the various markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all these worked out to\r\n\r\nsomething like 3,700 different rates of fees which\r\n\r\nhad to be collected by the Hawkers Department.  To\r\n\r\nfurther complicate matters, at least three markets\r\n\r\nof  the  same  class  in  the  city  area  charged\r\n\r\ndifferent  rates of fees. In addition, there  were\r\n\r\nalso different fees for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) street hawker pitches which varied from one\r\n\r\nrural area to another, the city having a standard\r\n\r\nrate;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) hawkers' shelters which varied from site to site:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) stallholders occupying vacant lands;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) itinerant hawkers;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) private markets;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) pasar malam hawkers; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) wall showcase hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  has  led to considerable administrative  and\r\n\r\naccounting   difficulties  and,  at  times,   much\r\n\r\nconfusion.  The  new regulations which  came  into\r\n\r\nforce  on the 1st January, 1970, reduced the  five\r\n\r\nclasses  of  markets  to  two,  and  revised   and\r\n\r\nstandardised  licence  fees for  stall-holders  in\r\n\r\nmarkets  and for the various categories of hawkers\r\n\r\nwhich have remained unchanged for over 20 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the integration of the City Council into the\r\n\r\nRural   Board   in  1963,  it  was  necessary   to\r\n\r\nstandardise  the various rates prevailing  in  the\r\n\r\ncity  and  rural  areas and  also  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nnumerous   categories   and  classifications.   In\r\n\r\ngeneral,  the  fees  for  hawkers  have  not  been\r\n\r\nraised,  except  for itinerant  and  wall-showcase\r\n\r\nhawkers  whose  fees have been brought  into  line\r\n\r\nwith   the  rates  payable  by  the  street  pitch\r\n\r\nhawkers.   The   increase  of  fees   for   market\r\n\r\nstallholders is marginal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small and compact city state such as ours,\r\n\r\nit  is  not unreasonable to have uniform rates  of\r\n\r\nfees  for hawkers within the city area or without.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons I have mentioned and the fact that\r\n\r\nthe new fees have only just been introduced, I  am\r\n\r\nnot inclined to consider reverting to the previous\r\n\r\npractice  of  having separate rates  of  fees  for\r\n\r\nhawkers conducting business in different parts  of\r\n\r\nthe island. In any case, Mr Speaker, Sir, what is\r\n\r\nthe  yardstick  to  gauge the income  of  hawkers,\r\n\r\nshort  of standing beside them and keeping  watch?\r\n\r\nIf  a  foolproof  method exists,  I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nComptroller of Income Tax will be most interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

In September 1963, it became part  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaysia. In August 1965, it  became\r\n\r\na republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution has undergone three fundamental\r\n\r\nchanges  in  a space of six years. It has  created\r\n\r\nconfusion   in   several  areas  whether   certain\r\n\r\nprovisions  continued to be law or were superseded\r\n\r\nand altered. The present Constitutional provisions\r\n\r\nrelating  to the Public Service Commission  are  a\r\n\r\ncarry-over  of  those when  we  were  a  state  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  The  Government could  have  left  this\r\n\r\nConstitution (Amendment) Bill to be taken together\r\n\r\nwith  the  draft Constitution. This draft  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing  vetted  by expert constitutional  draftsmen\r\n\r\nbefore  it is tabled in this House. But  this  may\r\n\r\ntake  some time. And since it is the intention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to afford every  institution  and\r\n\r\ncitizen an opportunity to make representations  on\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional draft, it may be a  few  years\r\n\r\nbefore it is promulgated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has, therefore, been decided that we should\r\n\r\ntake the provisions relating to the Public Service\r\n\r\nCommission in a separate Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes have been made to the existing provisions\r\n\r\nin   the  Constitution  which  were  thought   too\r\n\r\nrestrictive   for   the   proper   and   efficient\r\n\r\nfunctioning of the Public Service Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to re-enact and provide a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  part  in our  Constitution  dealing\r\n\r\nwith   the   public  service.  The  constitutional\r\n\r\nchanges  brought  about  since  independence  have\r\n\r\nnecessitated  these  changes. The  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission have also recommended other changes  as\r\n\r\na  result  of their experiences, especially  after\r\n\r\nAugust 1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill amends the Articles in the Constitution\r\n\r\ndealing  with  the qualifications  and  tenure  of\r\n\r\noffice  of the Chairman and members of the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission. There will now be a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaximum of seven and a minimum of four members  of\r\n\r\nthe   Public  Service  Commission,  excluding  the\r\n\r\nChairman, instead of the present maximum  of  four\r\n\r\nand   minimum  of  two  members.  The   provisions\r\n\r\nrelating to the qualifications for membership have\r\n\r\nbeen  redrafted  to widen the choice  of  suitable\r\n\r\ncandidates for membership. Article 74 in clause  2\r\n\r\nof   the  Bill  now  contains,  in  more  specific\r\n\r\nlanguage, those disqualifications from membership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, there have been doubts whether the\r\n\r\npresent  Article  80  would  prevent  the   Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission  from delegating  any  of  its\r\n\r\npowers or functions, save to public officers. This\r\n\r\nmay  put  in  question  the  validity  of  certain\r\n\r\ndecisions of the Public Service Commission and its\r\n\r\ndelegates  which  were  made  in  good  faith.  In\r\n\r\nseveral  cases, the appointment of a delegate  has\r\n\r\nbeen  at  the request, or with the express consent\r\n\r\nor  approval,  of the persons concerned  with,  or\r\n\r\ndirectly   involved  in,  the  exercise   of   the\r\n\r\nfunctions by the Public Service Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid litigation on procedural and technical\r\n\r\ngrounds,  provisions  validating  them  have  been\r\n\r\ninserted in Article 80D in clause 2 of the Bill so\r\n\r\nthat   no   proceedings  may  be   instituted   or\r\n\r\nmaintained  against the Commission as a  whole  or\r\n\r\nany of its members for any exercise of such powers\r\n\r\nand  rights.  But  where the  bona  fides  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission  i3  challenged,  and  not  just  legal\r\n\r\ntechnicalities,  a suit can be  taken  and  remedy\r\n\r\nsought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intention of the Government that\r\n\r\nthose  aggrieved by an excess of authority  should\r\n\r\nbe  prevented from seeking legitimate  redress  as\r\n\r\nthe law allows. But the Government has to, and  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to,  take the responsibility,  with  the\r\n\r\nsupport   of  Members  of  this  House,  to   move\r\n\r\nvalidation  clauses  in the new  Bill,  to  negate\r\n\r\nfrivolous or vexatious attempts at litigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes, I hope, will enable the Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission the more efficiently to  carry\r\n\r\nout their functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Bill. Its\r\n\r\npurpose  is to strengthen the hands of the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission  so  that  it  will  be   more\r\n\r\neffective  in  doing its work. We  know  that  the\r\n\r\nP.S.C, is busy all the year round, because it  has\r\n\r\nto   deal  with  thousands  of  applications   for\r\n\r\nappointments  as public officers and  other  jobs.\r\n\r\nThere  are  only  a  few members  sitting  on  the\r\n\r\nCommission  and, as such, they are  tied  down  to\r\n\r\ntheir  work, and consequently there are delays  in\r\n\r\ndealing   with   applications.   Therefore,    the\r\n\r\namendment  Bill has been introduced  at  the  most\r\n\r\nappropriate time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the Public Service Commission\r\n\r\nis  a very important institution of the state.

This  will  enable  some  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  to  be  appointed as  members  of  the\r\n\r\nP.S.C, and  render their services to the  country\r\n\r\nwell.

Most of the civil servants  variable\r\n\r\nallowances  are now consolidated into their  basic\r\n\r\nsalaries.   Can   the  Minister  say   whether   a\r\n\r\npensioner's allowance can be consolidated into his\r\n\r\npension?

In the\r\n\r\ncase of serving officers, pension is calculated on\r\n\r\nbasic   salary   so  that  when   their   variable\r\n\r\nallowances  are  consolidated  into  their   basic\r\n\r\nsalary,  that  will have the effect of  increasing\r\n\r\nthe amount of pension for which they are eligible.\r\n\r\nThis  does not apply to pensions, in Still I  will\r\n\r\nbear in mind what the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Anson has said. I suspect a lot of\r\n\r\nthese  matters  remain as they are  through  sheer\r\n\r\nbureaucratic inertia, it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay well be that by the year 2000, unless somebody\r\n\r\nis  energetic  enough to inquire and question  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  this  allowance, we  might  still  have\r\n\r\npensioners   drawing   their   cost   of    living\r\n\r\nallowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the questions raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong Kapor, there has not been any increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  number of officers retiring. I will give  the\r\n\r\nmid-year  figures of the number  of  officers  who\r\n\r\nretired  in 1967, 1968 and 1969. In mid-1967,  467\r\n\r\nofficers   retired.  In  mid-1968,  553   officers\r\n\r\nretired.  And  in mid-1969, 517 officers  retired.\r\n\r\nThe  number  of officers retiring in mid-1969  was\r\n\r\nless than that in mid-1968. However, because those\r\n\r\nwho  retired in 1969 apparently drew more pay, the\r\n\r\nnet  effect  would  be that  the  cost  of  living\r\n\r\nallowances  went  up by 13.4  per  cent  in  1969.\r\n\r\nWhereas  in  1968,  the cost of living  allowances\r\n\r\nwent  up  by seven per cent as compared  with  the\r\n\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of living allowances are provided to\r\n\r\npensioners  drawing less than $320  per  month  if\r\n\r\nthey   have  dependants  and  also  to  pensioners\r\n\r\ndrawing  less than $250 per month if they have  no\r\n\r\ndependants.  It  so happened that last  year,  the\r\n\r\nnumber of pensioners eligible for these allowances\r\n\r\nwas larger than had been expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $136,250 for Head 0402 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the First Supplementary Estimates of\r\n\r\nExpenditure  for the financial year  1st  January,\r\n\r\n1969, to 31st March, 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,412,000 for Head 0701 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the First Supplementary Estimates of\r\n\r\nExpenditure  for the financial year  1st  January,\r\n\r\n1969, to 31st March, 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, \"That the sum of $1,548,250 shall be\r\n\r\nsupplied  to  the Government under  the  heads  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the public services shown  in  the\r\n\r\nFirst Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the financial year 1st January, 1969, to 31St\r\n\r\nMarch,  1970, contained in Paper Cmd. 7 of  1970,\"\r\n\r\nput, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution to be reported.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Second Supplementary Development Estimates of\r\n\r\nExpenditure  for the financial year  1st  January,\r\n\r\n1969, to 31st March, 1970, contained in Paper Cmd.\r\n\r\n8  of 1970.

An area of  about\r\n\r\n1,000 acres is now being levelled by cutting  down\r\n\r\nhills  and  filling up swamps. At the  same  time,\r\n\r\nland  is  being dredged to produce two channels  - one  is being called Benoi channel, which is 4,000\r\n\r\nfeet  long,  750 feet wide and 15 feet  deep.  The\r\n\r\nother is Tanjong Gul channel, which is 6,000  feet\r\n\r\nlong,  1,500  feet wide and 20 feet  deep.

These are now world famous  and\r\n\r\nwe  derive  justifiable pride from  them.  In  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of breaking the back of, if not  solving,\r\n\r\nthe  problems of physical housing, we have created\r\n\r\nproblems of a different dimension involving  human\r\n\r\nbeings and their social habits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progression from the environment of\r\n\r\ntraditional  slums  to  that  of  high-rise  flats\r\n\r\nimplies  the need for a change in communal values,\r\n\r\nattitudes and standards of social cleanliness.  It\r\n\r\nis insufficient for a human being to be impeccably\r\n\r\nclean  within the confines of his flat, but to  be\r\n\r\ncareless  of  what  he does in  elevators,  common\r\n\r\nstairways and corridors let alone common  latrines\r\n\r\nand   baths.  Even  elevators  are  mistaken   for\r\n\r\nlatrines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our blocks of flats are becoming new\r\n\r\nslums,  with an environment not conducive  to  the\r\n\r\nhealthy growth of the next and subsequent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngenerations  of human beings. It is now  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  human beings living in blocks of flats to  be\r\n\r\norganised on a corporate basis with their own self-governing institutions, perhaps along the lines of\r\n\r\nmanagement  committees of community centres,  with\r\n\r\nadequate  powers to manage the social problems  of\r\n\r\nflat-dwelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come, Mr Speaker, for the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development  Board  to  direct  part  of  its\r\n\r\nenergies  to  solving  these  new  problems  which\r\n\r\ninvolve not construction but human materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the tenor of my remarks will\r\n\r\nfollow  very  much the same lines as those  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleague  from  Bukit Panjang. I agree  with  him\r\n\r\nthat  it  will be very difficult for us to gainsay\r\n\r\nthe  achievements of the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard.  The  Minister  for  Finance  himself   has\r\n\r\nreferred to the tremendous increase in the  number\r\n\r\nof  houses  built in the last ten  years.  It  has\r\n\r\nincreased by about five times the original  number\r\n\r\nin 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own very slight reading on the subject of\r\n\r\nhousing projects has given me an impression which,\r\n\r\nI  hope, is not simply due to the fact that I have\r\n\r\nnot    read   sufficiently,   that   our   housing\r\n\r\nachievements  are,  perhaps,  the  best  and  most\r\n\r\neffective  in  the  world. I  have  read  that  in\r\n\r\nAmerica,  for example, federal aid has been  given\r\n\r\nto  middle-income  housing  projects,  whereas   a\r\n\r\nrelatively small programme is devoted to  aid  low\r\n\r\nincome housing projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore the emphasis has been on the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  homes  for  low  income  groups.  In\r\n\r\naddition  to  that, we are also providing  schemes\r\n\r\nfor  home ownership so that not only do we provide\r\n\r\nour  people, especially those in the lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup,  with shelter at comparatively low rentals,\r\n\r\nbut  we  offer  them security by giving  them  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to buy their own homes on easy  terms.\r\n\r\nThis,  therefore, demonstrates a  relationship  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility    between   the    blousing    and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  people who live in flats and houses  provided\r\n\r\nby  the Housing and Development Board. However,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  this  relationship  is  essentially  a\r\n\r\nbureaucratic one. I would like to ask  whether  we\r\n\r\nshould  not take a greater interest in the  people\r\n\r\nwho live in these Housing Board flats, and whether\r\n\r\nwe   should  not  attempt  to  encourage  them  to\r\n\r\nconsider  the places in which they live  as  homes\r\n\r\nand  not  simply as housing units? We can  already\r\n\r\ndetect  a growing interest among officers  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard in this respect. For example, fountains  are\r\n\r\nprovided in order to beautify the precincts  of  a\r\n\r\nHousing   and   Development  Board  project.   The\r\n\r\nimportant  point  is  to  educate  the  people  to\r\n\r\nrespect   these  social  amenities.  For  example,\r\n\r\nshrubbery  must  not be destroyed,  and  fountains\r\n\r\nshould not be defiled, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we set about inculcating a sense of pride\r\n\r\nand affection in the community and a commitment to\r\n\r\nthe  neighbourhood?  Perhaps  we  should  take   a\r\n\r\ngreater  interest in the sociological  aspects  of\r\n\r\ncommunity   development.   In   this   connection,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  we  could ask the Minister for  Law  and\r\n\r\nNational Development how interested is the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board in getting the services  of\r\n\r\nsociologists  to help them find out  the  problems\r\n\r\nthat  affect  people  who  live  in  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board flats. There are many  measures\r\n\r\nthat  one can just give as examples. Could we  not\r\n\r\nprovide  premises for people who live  in  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board flats to meet  and  discuss\r\n\r\nthe  improvement of their neighbourhood? Could not\r\n\r\nthese  same  premises also serve as centres  where\r\n\r\npeople  could  come together, view an  educational\r\n\r\nT.V, programme  and  learn  to   improve   their\r\n\r\nenvironment?  They can also learn something  about\r\n\r\ndomestic   economy,   about   beautifying    their\r\n\r\npremises, and about subjects that will make  life\r\n\r\nthat  much more worth living. This would give  the\r\n\r\npeople  a  greater  sense of commitment  to  their\r\n\r\nenvironment.  These same premises  could  also  be\r\n\r\nused  by  the  children who live in these  crowded\r\n\r\nquarters  to  study and prepare for  their  school\r\n\r\nwork. These are just a few examples of what could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  done to augment the human qualities of life in\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one could comment on the polar attitudes\r\n\r\nthat  are taken by the community and by the estate\r\n\r\nofficer in charge of a particular area. This is an\r\n\r\nunfortunate situation. Sometimes an M.P, is caught\r\n\r\nbetween the estate officer trying to implement the\r\n\r\nBoard's  rules  and  the community  who  seems  to\r\n\r\nregard the estate officer as a natural antagonist.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  something  could  be  done  to  encourage\r\n\r\nbetter  relationship between the Board's  officers\r\n\r\nand  the community. In this connection, one  could\r\n\r\nask what sort of training is given to officers  of\r\n\r\nthe   Board   in   the  understanding   of   human\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, may I thank both Members\r\n\r\nfor  their  kind  words and then attempt  to  meet\r\n\r\ntheir criticisms or perhaps suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I say that the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  has  been  very  conscious  of  the  social\r\n\r\nconditions which have come about through living in\r\n\r\nflats,  some of which are high-rise.  In  1966,  a\r\n\r\nsample  survey was taken in some estates  and  the\r\n\r\nnet result was a report prepared by Mr Stephen H.\r\n\r\nK.  Yeh  and  Mr Lee Yoke San in 1968 on  housing\r\n\r\nconditions  in Singapore. This report  dealt  with\r\n\r\nall  the  trends  and implications,  and  I  would\r\n\r\ncommend it to both Members. Perhaps I could  touch\r\n\r\non  some of its conclusions. Sir, I quote at  page\r\n\r\n28 of the report:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For the first time in Singapore, living in these\r\n\r\nhigh-rise fiats has created a new way of life  for\r\n\r\na significant proportion of the population. Social\r\n\r\nchange,  as  reflected in people's lives,  is  the\r\n\r\nresult  of the inter-play of physical, social  and\r\n\r\nindividual  factors  and,  therefore,   both   the\r\n\r\nquantitative  and  qualitative aspects  of  living\r\n\r\nhave  to  he  studied together,  if  comprehensive\r\n\r\nknowledge is to be gained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, at the present time, there are some\r\n\r\n200,000  people  living in the  congested  central\r\n\r\narea  of  3  1/2- square miles, most of  which  is\r\n\r\nscheduled  for slum clearance, and the  population\r\n\r\nreallocated  to public housing in the interest  of\r\n\r\nsound  land-use policy, better social welfare  and\r\n\r\ngeneral economic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the social structure of slums\r\n\r\ndeserves attention\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd they go on and on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board is acting in\r\n\r\naccordance with the recommendations made  in  this\r\n\r\nreport  and  has  made some plans to  improve  the\r\n\r\nliving  conditions of tenants in the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board estates. I would remind Members,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  of  the  sports complex  at  Queenstown,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  at  the moment under construction.  The\r\n\r\nBoard  is spending $2,000,000 on this complex.  It\r\n\r\nwill  be completed by July this year and will have\r\n\r\nfive swimming pools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another particular item is the reservation of 40\r\n\r\nacres of land at Toa Payoh for the construction of\r\n\r\nanother  sports complex. Work has not yet started,\r\n\r\nbut  it  will be done so that the younger children\r\n\r\nwill  have  more playgrounds, and the  older  ones\r\n\r\nwill  have basket-ball courts. The Board has  been\r\n\r\nvery  conscious of the needs of the people  living\r\n\r\nin  flats, and in every housing estate places  are\r\n\r\nreserved not only for shops but markets and stalls\r\n\r\nand   even  cinemas.  Sometimes  light  and  clean\r\n\r\nindustries  are  provided  in  order  to   provide\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to the little details about keeping\r\n\r\ncommon corridors and lifts clean. It would be very\r\n\r\nexpensive,  from  the Board's point  of  view,  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  liftman. I am sure Members will  agree\r\n\r\nwith  me that this is a process of education,  but\r\n\r\none thing we have done, and which has resulted  in\r\n\r\ncleaner homes and cleaner estates, is the sale  of\r\n\r\nthe  estates. A man who owns his own home sees  to\r\n\r\nit that it is clean. He sees to it that the common\r\n\r\ncorridors are clean. He sees to it that the  lifts\r\n\r\nare  not  dirty.

As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings stand at the moment, there appears to be no\r\n\r\narrangement  in force to keep Parliament  informed\r\n\r\nof the progress made on new ventures embarked upon\r\n\r\nby  these  agencies from time to  time.  While  an\r\n\r\nordinary shareholder in a public company  is  sent\r\n\r\nan  annual  report  by  his  company,  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  are denied this courtesy by  most,  if\r\n\r\nnot all, of these agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has fully explained in general the\r\n\r\nrationale  behind  the setting  up  of  Government\r\n\r\nagencies,   which   is   well   appreciated    and\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly  supported by this House.  However,\r\n\r\nthere is, to my mind, the need for the performance\r\n\r\nand  activities of these agencies to be kept under\r\n\r\nconstant  review by Parliament, so  as  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  they  will not veer from the  objectives  or\r\n\r\npurposes  for which their setting up was intended,\r\n\r\nand  that  there is no unnecessary  or  unintended\r\n\r\nconflict  of  interests  committed  wittingly   or\r\n\r\nunwittingly either with the public sector or  with\r\n\r\nthe private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that all these aspects have not\r\n\r\nescaped  the  attention of the  Minister,  but  to\r\n\r\nensure  the long-term continued accountability  of\r\n\r\nthese   agencies  to  Parliament,   perhaps   some\r\n\r\narrangement  ought to be made at  this  stage  for\r\n\r\nParliament to receive periodical progress  reports\r\n\r\nfrom them. In saying so, it is not my intention to\r\n\r\nsuggest that Parliament should interfere with  the\r\n\r\nwork of the professionals or to impose unnecessary\r\n\r\nrestrictions or limitations upon the activities of\r\n\r\nthese  agencies, as such a course of  action  will\r\n\r\nonly hamper the healthy growth of such agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I would like to touch on the sum of $70\r\n\r\nmillion  to  be  voted as a Joan  to  the  Neptune\r\n\r\nOrient Lines Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed gratifying to note that since\r\n\r\nits  operation last June, the Neptune Orient Lines\r\n\r\nhas performed very well.

This\r\n\r\nbeing  the  case, its cargo ships are barred  from\r\n\r\nconveying goods to and from Japan, whereas vessels\r\n\r\nof the other members of the Conference are allowed\r\n\r\nto  enter  Japanese ports to collect and discharge\r\n\r\ncargoes.  With the advent of containerisation,  it\r\n\r\nis  vital  for Singapore to venture into  Japanese\r\n\r\nports: otherwise she will not be able to make  use\r\n\r\nof  her  future container ships for the Far  East-Europe run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is learnt that the reason for the refusal of\r\n\r\nNeptune  Orient Lines' entry as a full  member  of\r\n\r\nthe Conference is that its performance has not yet\r\n\r\ncome  up  to expectations. I understand  that  the\r\n\r\nNeptune  Orient Lines' case to extend its services\r\n\r\nto  Japan has been presented to the F.E.F.C.,  and\r\n\r\nnegotiations  have  taken  place  in  London  last\r\n\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is our duty to safeguard the interests of\r\n\r\nthe  Neptune  Orient  Lines, as  it  involves  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in a loan of $70 million. It is  futile\r\n\r\nto  possess a car without making full use  of  it.\r\n\r\nLikewise, having been accepted as a member of  the\r\n\r\nF.E.F.C., it is considered unfair that the Neptune\r\n\r\nOrient Lines, as compared to other members, is not\r\n\r\nable to enjoy the full benefit of the rights.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, Japanese vessels have been permitted  to\r\n\r\ncarry  Singapore  cargoes to Europe;  whereas  the\r\n\r\nNeptune Orient Lines' vessels have been limited to\r\n\r\ntransporting goods to and from Hong Kong only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, will the Minister be kind enough to inform\r\n\r\nthis House of the outcome of the negotiations held\r\n\r\nin  London in respect of the rights of the Neptune\r\n\r\nOrient  Lines, and what appropriate  steps  is  he\r\n\r\ncontemplating  to  take in  order  to  extend  the\r\n\r\nservices of the Neptune Orient Lines in future?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is good that\r\n\r\nenterprise in Singapore is so free that Government\r\n\r\nis  also  participating in  it.

So when a small country  like\r\n\r\nSingapore gets involved in the big league, I think\r\n\r\nwe  are  under certain disabilities.  Let  us  not\r\n\r\nassume  that,  in terms of financial resources  or\r\n\r\npolitical power, we are of the same stature as big\r\n\r\ncountries like the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany,\r\n\r\nor  the  United States. Nevertheless,  within  our\r\n\r\nrather  limited capabilities, we have  obtained  a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of sailing rights from the F.E.F.C.\r\n\r\nAt  present we are allowed 12 sailings a year from\r\n\r\nJune  1969 to July this year; one sailing a  month\r\n\r\nfrom  Hong  Kong  to Singapore,  Port  Swettenham,\r\n\r\nPenang,  Britain and Western Europe. As from  July\r\n\r\nthis year till the end of next year, the number of\r\n\r\nsailings will increase from 12 to 18, which is one\r\n\r\nsailing  every three weeks instead of one  sailing\r\n\r\nevery  month, with the proviso that sailings  from\r\n\r\nHong Kong will remain at 12 per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also some restrictions as regards cargo\r\n\r\ntonnage limitations, the types of cargoes, and  so\r\n\r\non,  which  Neptune Orient Lines  can  collect  at\r\n\r\nvarious  ports. These restrictions are covered  by\r\n\r\nconfidential agreement, and I am not at liberty to\r\n\r\ndivulge them,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, negotiations took place\r\n\r\nwith  the  object  of getting for  Neptune  Orient\r\n\r\nLines  sailing  rights  from  Japan,  as  far   as\r\n\r\nThailand,  and also rights to collect  cargo  from\r\n\r\nSouth  Thailand  and East Malaysia.  No  agreement\r\n\r\ncould   be   reached  in  the  course   of   these\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  and  a mediator  will  be  sent  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  April  to consider  Neptune  Orient\r\n\r\nLines' request for improved sailing rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company has now five freighters on the Far\r\n\r\nEast  run, one freighter on the Straits-Japan run,\r\n\r\none  tanker on world-wide charter, and one coaster\r\n\r\ncarrying  cargo  in regional waters.  The  company\r\n\r\nalso  has  a  super tanker of 233,000 dead  weight\r\n\r\ntons  on order. This is in partnership with a Hong\r\n\r\nKong   company.  So  far  the  company  has   done\r\n\r\nreasonably  well. It will be some time before  the\r\n\r\naudited   accounts  for  the  first  six   months'\r\n\r\noperations are available, because in the nature of\r\n\r\nthe  business,  accounts  have  to  be  collected,\r\n\r\nassembled and audited from the different ports  of\r\n\r\ncall.  The final preparation and auditing  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany's  accounts  are more difficult  and  take\r\n\r\nlonger  time than would be the case of an ordinary\r\n\r\ncommercial venture. However, because of the rather\r\n\r\ngood trading conditions last year, the company has\r\n\r\ndone  much  better than new shipping companies  of\r\n\r\nthis sort would normally do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Chartered Industries of Singapore\r\n\r\nLtd.,  again,  this  company has  been  performing\r\n\r\nreasonably well, its first year's operation  shows\r\n\r\na return of 18 per cent of capital invested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Chartering Enterprises Pte. Ltd., a subject\r\n\r\nraised  by  the Member for Jalan Kayu, is  a  very\r\n\r\nsmall  air cargo company. Its operation is limited\r\n\r\nto  lifting  cargo between Singapore  and  certain\r\n\r\ncountries  in the region. Whether it  will  expand\r\n\r\nbeyond this modest operation is something I cannot\r\n\r\nsay for certain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue from Jurong Bird Park Pte. Ltd, will\r\n\r\nbe  from gate receipts. I do not know whether this\r\n\r\nwill be sufficient to pay for the operation costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplus  interest  on  the loan and  depreciation  of\r\n\r\nproperties.  However,  as  compared   with   other\r\n\r\nenterprises   of   this  kind,  for   example,   a\r\n\r\nzoological  garden  or  a  marineland,  the  great\r\n\r\nadvantage  of an aviary is that it does  not  cost\r\n\r\nmuch  to  feed birds. Furthermore, birds do  breed\r\n\r\nand,  given  luck, some side income  may  even  be\r\n\r\ngenerated from the sale of birds to other aviaries\r\n\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong Shipbuilders Ltd, will not be in\r\n\r\nproduction  for  some years.  We  have  now  under\r\n\r\ntraining  in  Japanese shipyards some 249  workers\r\n\r\nrecruited  by  Jurong Shipbuilders Ltd.,  and  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of the dock and quays will  commence\r\n\r\nlater this month. On the 21st of March, 1970,  the\r\n\r\ndirectors   expect  to  award  tenders   for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction.  This dockyard may be  completed  by\r\n\r\nApril  next year. But the company will be in  full\r\n\r\nproduction  only  by  the year  1975  when  it  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to build some six Freedom-type  ships  a\r\n\r\nyear.  Whether Neptune Orient Lines Ltd, will  buy\r\n\r\nships from Jurong Shipbuilders Ltd. I do not know.\r\n\r\nPresumably, if they need Freedom-type ships, which\r\n\r\ncan  carry  both  containers as  well  as  general\r\n\r\ncargo,  then  they  will give  their  business  to\r\n\r\nJurong  Shipbuilders Ltd. But it is  by  no  means\r\n\r\nobligatory on the company to buy ships from Jurong\r\n\r\nShipbuilders Ltd., although one hopes they will do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the accountability of our enterprises\r\n\r\nto Parliament, I think we should have a clear idea\r\n\r\nwhat  accountability means. If it is a  matter  of\r\n\r\nproviding information to Members of Parliament, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  this  can be done regularly  at  Question\r\n\r\nTime. If it is a matter of answering questions  on\r\n\r\nmatters  arising from these enterprises or  indeed\r\n\r\nany  enterprises, then Ministers, of  course,  are\r\n\r\navailable   to   give   such   information.    But\r\n\r\naccountability  to Parliament as a  constitutional\r\n\r\nprinciple,  I  think, goes beyond this.
