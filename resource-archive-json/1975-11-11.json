Army commanders prefer\r\n\r\nbetter  educated soldiers because they  know  that\r\n\r\nwhether  these men are riflemen, storemen, medical\r\n\r\norderlies,   clerks  or  cooks,   experience   has\r\n\r\nconfirmed that better educated soldiers are easier\r\n\r\nto  instruct,  carry out their  orders  and  daily\r\n\r\nchores  with  fewer  mistakes and  generally  pose\r\n\r\nfewer disciplinary problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past there have been research studies\r\n\r\nconducted   by   the   Personnel   Research    and\r\n\r\nEducational Department\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Mindef to evaluate how useful criteria such as\r\n\r\neducation  level  and  IQ test  performances  have\r\n\r\nproved  in  assigning  recruits  to  various  army\r\n\r\nvocations.  Statistical computation shows  that  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  level of correlation  exists  between\r\n\r\nperformance in course results and education level.\r\n\r\nIf   we   take  education  level  and  IQ  results\r\n\r\ntogether,  the  correlation is  even  better  than\r\n\r\neducation level alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 1973 the study covered five vocations\r\n\r\n-   clerk   (class  II),  pay  clerks,   technical\r\n\r\nstoremen,  linesmen and recce troopers.  At  other\r\n\r\ntimes similar studies have been made in respect of\r\n\r\nother vocations, both in the army and navy as well\r\n\r\nas  in the officer cadet courses. As expected, the\r\n\r\nassociation  between performance in these  courses\r\n\r\nand education level is statistically significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies will be made available to the hon.\r\n\r\nMember if he wants them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the second part of the Member's\r\n\r\nquestion, that is, relating to training  and  work\r\n\r\nexperience,  these  are  taken  into  account   in\r\n\r\nassigning    recruits   to   military   vocations.\r\n\r\nNaturally, training and experience in a particular\r\n\r\ncivilian   vocation   would   result   in   better\r\n\r\nperformance  in  the  SAF  in  related  vocations,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  technical  vocations   such   as\r\n\r\nmechanics, electricians, draughtsmen, fitters  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  However, it often happens that the supply\r\n\r\nof  technically  trained  recruits  in  particular\r\n\r\nlines  exceeds  the requirement for  that  intake.\r\n\r\nWhen  this  happens, the surplus will have  to  be\r\n\r\nassigned to other vocations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether national servicemen are assigned to jobs\r\n\r\naccording to their educational qualification.

Another is that many school\r\n\r\nleavers  stopped using or learning English because\r\n\r\ntheir  home and neighbourhood make them revert  to\r\n\r\ndialect. The emphasis now is on teaching what  the\r\n\r\npupils  can  absorb.  The  restructuring  of   the\r\n\r\nEducation  system  advocates  pupils  learning  at\r\n\r\ntheir  own  rate (i.e, they will progress  to  the\r\n\r\nnext  higher  grade only when they are  ready  for\r\n\r\nit).

The Ministry  can\r\n\r\nonly encourage pupils and advise parents, wherever\r\n\r\npossible,  but the final decision rests  with  the\r\n\r\nparents  themselves.

The\r\n\r\nsupporting  environment  is,  as  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong has said, the home environment in which the\r\n\r\npupil  normally speaks a language, whether  it  is\r\n\r\nEnglish, Mandarin or any dialect. Therefore, it is\r\n\r\nnot  possible  for the Ministry  of  Education  to\r\n\r\nchange the child's environment. However, as far as\r\n\r\npossible,  we  can  try  to  tailor  his   studies\r\n\r\naccording to his ability. For instance, in a class\r\n\r\nwhere there are so many pupils, the teacher cannot\r\n\r\ndo  very  much for a child who lags behind,  other\r\n\r\nthan  trying as best she can to see that the child\r\n\r\nlearns as much as he can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education might consider reaching  out\r\n\r\nto the child's environment through the mass media.\r\n\r\nWe  have an Educational Television Service and  we\r\n\r\nalso  have a good Broadcasting service.  Will  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State consider reaching  out  to  the\r\n\r\nchildren  who  are  not  so  good  in  the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage through the mass media?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that at the\r\n\r\nmoment the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETV service broadcasts quite a number of hours  of\r\n\r\neducational  material, but the Education  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas no plan as yet to go into this.

These charges are already concessional\r\n\r\nsince none of these Authorities pay their way  and\r\n\r\nnone  of  them charge the full cost.  As  for  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  and Chinese Gardens, it is not practical\r\n\r\nto  have  different  admission charges  for  local\r\n\r\nresidents and citizens living outside Jurong Town.\r\n\r\nIn  any  case,  discrimination is  undesirable  as\r\n\r\nthese  gardens are meant for the enjoyment of  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans. However, I would suggest that, since\r\n\r\nthere  are  concessionary rates for large  groups,\r\n\r\nand  for combined visits to both the Japanese  and\r\n\r\nChinese Gardens, the Member for Jurong may wish to\r\n\r\nconsider how such visits at reduced rates  can  be\r\n\r\narranged  through  the  Jurong  Community  Centre,\r\n\r\nschools,    residents    associations,    citizens\r\n\r\nconsultative committees and other organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>JURONG TOWN CORPORATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Maintenance services to tenants and lessees)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance if he will ascertain from the Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation whether the Corporation will look into\r\n\r\nthe  matter  of  providing  prompt  and  efficient\r\n\r\nmaintenance  services  to  all  its  tenants   and\r\n\r\nlessees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand from the Jurong\r\n\r\nTown   Corporation  that  it  has  already   taken\r\n\r\nnecessary  measures  to  improve  its  maintenance\r\n\r\nservices in the residential,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial  and other areas of Jurong  Town.

Apart  from  applied\r\n\r\nchemistry and telecommunications engineering,  the\r\n\r\ncourses offered by the College were mainly in  the\r\n\r\nliberal  arts and business studies. Following  its\r\n\r\nreconstitution   in   1967,  the   College   began\r\n\r\ndiversifying  its  courses  with  a  bias  towards\r\n\r\ntechnical  studies. The present enrolment  of  the\r\n\r\nCollege  is  1,652, the majority of  whom  are  in\r\n\r\nengineering   courses  leading  to  a   technician\r\n\r\ndiploma. In the next fiscal year, this will exceed\r\n\r\n2,500.  The  courses offered by  the  College  now\r\n\r\ninclude  mechanical  engineering,  electrical  and\r\n\r\nelectronic  engineering, shipbuilding  and  repair\r\n\r\ntechnology,   building   services   and   business\r\n\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the diverse nature of the courses it\r\n\r\nnow  offers, it is considered necessary to appoint\r\n\r\nsuitable members to the Council of the College  to\r\n\r\nenable  its  diverse interests to be  met.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore proposed to amend section 7(l)  (c)  and\r\n\r\n(g)  of  the Act to provide the Minister in charge\r\n\r\nwith  more flexibility to appoint Council  members\r\n\r\nto serve the interest of the College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the common seal of the College may\r\n\r\nonly  be  used or affixed on any document  in  the\r\n\r\npresence  of  the  Chairman or  a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  the  Principal  in  pursuance  of  a\r\n\r\nresolution  duly passed at a properly  constituted\r\n\r\nmeeting  of the Council and duly recorded  in  the\r\n\r\nminutes  of  that meeting.
