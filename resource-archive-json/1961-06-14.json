In nearly\r\n\r\nall   these  plantations  there  is,  de  facto,   a\r\n\r\nsituation  where the landlord has let  out  not  the\r\n\r\nland  but a licence to tenants or squatters to  rear\r\n\r\npigs,  poultry or fish, whilst retaining  possession\r\n\r\nand  tapping  his rubber or collecting his  coconut.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  provision  to  allow  a  tenant  to\r\n\r\nacquire  a  lease from the landlord at  an  economic\r\n\r\nrent,  subject  to  certain  maximum  safeguards  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the tenant, will work an obvious injustice\r\n\r\nin  that,  first, the tenant never had enjoyment  of\r\n\r\neither the coconut or the rubber, and his rent  (the\r\n\r\nbase  upon which the maximum economic rent is tied),\r\n\r\nbecause  he did not enjoy the fruits of the  coconut\r\n\r\nand  the  rubber, was a nominal one.  Therefore,  to\r\n\r\ngrant  the  tenant a lease would be to  exclude  the\r\n\r\nlandlord  from  possession  and  enjoyment  of   his\r\n\r\ncrop - be  it  rubber or coconut - and give  the  tenant\r\n\r\nsomething which he never had, never was entitled to,\r\n\r\nand never expect-ed to be entitled to. Therefore, it\r\n\r\nis  being considered now - and I am recommending  this\r\n\r\nto  the House - that in any legislation in respect of\r\n\r\nthe  grant of leases of agricultural land, provision\r\n\r\nshould  be made, in the ease of working coconut  and\r\n\r\nrubber  estates, whereby the tenant should be  given\r\n\r\nthe option of either a lease at economic rent, or  a\r\n\r\nlicence to occupy the land for specific user such as\r\n\r\nthe  rearing of poultry or pigs, with the  right  to\r\n\r\npossession  and enjoyment to the coconut  or  rubber\r\n\r\nremaining in the landlord. In other words,  what  we\r\n\r\nhope  to  achieve would be, in effect, to  give  the\r\n\r\ntenant  a  licence  which  is  irrevocable   for   a\r\n\r\nspecified  term of, say, 12 years, but  the  licence\r\n\r\nwill  specify  the  user to which  the  licensee  is\r\n\r\nentitled. I mean, if he has been rearing chickens or\r\n\r\npigs, he will continue to rear chickens or pigs, but\r\n\r\nthe  landlord will continue to collect  his  coconut\r\n\r\nand rubber. The alternative is for the tenant to pay\r\n\r\nthe  whole economic rent and he collects the  rubber\r\n\r\nand the coconut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am unable to say that we can produce legislation\r\n\r\nwhich will please all parties, but I do suggest that\r\n\r\nif  we  are to do justice in this case, this is  the\r\n\r\nonly way in which we can ensure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  conditions  are created in which  farmers  are\r\n\r\ngiven  if  not security of tenure, then security  of\r\n\r\nuser  of  land for specified purposes to  carry  out\r\n\r\nactivities in agriculture - be it poultry-farming  or\r\n\r\npig-rearing - and,  at  the  same  time,   allow   the\r\n\r\nlandlord to continue to derive that interest in  the\r\n\r\nland  which he always had, namely the collection  of\r\n\r\nrubber and coconut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Government to allow the\r\n\r\ntwo  Bills  to  lapse.

After  the\r\n\r\nprorogation,  it  is hoped that new  Bills  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced which will incorporate these new clauses.\r\n\r\nBy  tabling  this motion, I am, in fact, inviting  a\r\n\r\ndebate - I  hope a constructive one - as to how  we  can\r\n\r\nequitably   work   out   our   policy   of    giving\r\n\r\nencouragement  to agriculture but  under  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions  which  would not impose  an  unnecessary\r\n\r\nradical change in the proprietary position of \r\n\r\nland-ownership  or  the enjoyment of the  fruits  of  the\r\n\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention here that several\r\n\r\nrepresentations  have  been  made  in   the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, a number of which are unacceptable to  us\r\n\r\nas the Government. I can only say now that we cannot\r\n\r\nhope  to  push such legislation through without,  in\r\n\r\nprinciple,  accepting  the fact  that  there  is  an\r\n\r\ninterference of the right of ownership to land,  and\r\n\r\nthat   by   this  legislation  we  are,   in   fact,\r\n\r\ninterfering with the absolute right of ownership  to\r\n\r\nland.  There have been representations from  private\r\n\r\nestates   and   the  Land  and  Housing  Development\r\n\r\nAssociation  saying that to push through  these  new\r\n\r\nprovisions  would,  in fact, be to  foist  statutory\r\n\r\ntenants  on  landlords, that they  had  bought  land\r\n\r\nwhich  had  no  tenants  prior  to  1947,  and  that\r\n\r\ntherefore  they  would be deprived of  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nexpectation  of their ability to get  rid  of  their\r\n\r\ntenants  as  and  when they wished to  build.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid that, in principle,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  cannot consider all such representations  if  we\r\n\r\nare  to pursue the objects of the Bill, but we  can,\r\n\r\nto  a certain extent, meet periphery representations\r\n\r\nas to the workings of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, representation has been made on the\r\n\r\npoint that for the Bill to have the phrase \"economic\r\n\r\nrent\"  and, at the same time, to tie down  economic\r\n\r\nrent  to  a  maximum  of a certain  percentage  over\r\n\r\npresent rent is, in fact, a contradiction in  terms.\r\n\r\nLogically it is. Certain amendments in this  respect\r\n\r\nto  make  it  less illogical but nevertheless  still\r\n\r\npractical are being considered. On the side  of  the\r\n\r\ntenants,  they  also  would  not  like  any  maximum\r\n\r\nmentioned,  not for the reason that they  think  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  is  not to their advantage, but  that  they\r\n\r\nfeel  there would be a tendency for landlords always\r\n\r\nto  insist on the maximum in negotiating for leases.\r\n\r\nBoth the representations - the one from the landlords\r\n\r\nthat the maximum rent being tied to present rent and\r\n\r\neconomic  rent is illogical, and the other one  from\r\n\r\nthe  tenants  that  maximum  rent  should  never  be\r\n\r\nmentioned  at all because it would incite  landlords\r\n\r\nto  demand  the  maximum - are being  considered,  and\r\n\r\nprovision  will be introduced in the new Bill  which\r\n\r\nwill, we hope, meet the objections from both parties\r\n\r\ninsofar  as they can be reconciled. There  was  also\r\n\r\nrepresentation  that there should be  not  just  one\r\n\r\narbitrator  who is a Government official,  but  that\r\n\r\nthere should also be a tribunal - one representing the\r\n\r\nlandowners and one representing the tenants. And  it\r\n\r\nis  proposed  to  introduce a provision  whereby  in\r\n\r\ncases  where  the arbitrator deems it necessary,  he\r\n\r\ncan call upon the services of the tribunal to assist\r\n\r\nhim.  But in normal cases where he does not deem  it\r\n\r\nnecessary, he can proceed by himself.

We did  encounter\r\n\r\nsuch  a  difficulty during our time, and we  support\r\n\r\nthe principle of seeing to it that, in so far as the\r\n\r\ntenant  who  has been using the land for a  specific\r\n\r\nuse  is  concerned, he should be allowed to continue\r\n\r\nthat  tenancy for that specific use. But one anomaly\r\n\r\nmay creep in when the occupier of that land, who  is\r\n\r\nusing  it to raise poultry, wants a lease for rubber\r\n\r\nestate and coconut estate. He may be made use of  by\r\n\r\ncompetitors  who would like to break up the  estate,\r\n\r\nand  I  do not know in what way that can be met.

M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Yang \r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara's recommendation for the Road Traffic\r\n\r\nBill, and I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now  read\r\n\r\na Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will know that in accordance with  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of the Government, action is being taken  to\r\n\r\nintegrate  the  functions of  local  authorities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore with those of the Government. In regard to\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  which  is now before the  House,  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  the  integration  of  the   various\r\n\r\nfunctions   and  processes  which  relate   to   the\r\n\r\nadministration of road traffic in general and to the\r\n\r\noffice  of  the Registrar of Vehicles in particular.\r\n\r\nThe  responsibility,  Sir, for these  functions  and\r\n\r\nprocesses   is   at  present  shared   between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the local authorities.  It  will  in\r\n\r\nfuture  lie solely with the Government. This entails\r\n\r\na  transfer  to the Government of the responsibility\r\n\r\nfor  all those functions previously exercised by the\r\n\r\nCity Council and the Rural Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Road Traffic Ordinance provides for\r\n\r\nthe registration and licensing of motor vehicles and\r\n\r\nis not concerned with the registration and licensing\r\n\r\nof  non-motor vehicles. At present, it is  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  which  is the licensing authority  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of  registration and  licensing  of  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles, and the executive officer responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe various details of registration and licensing is\r\n\r\nthe   Registrar  of  Vehicles,  an  officer  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil. The functions relating to the licensing  of\r\n\r\ndrivers is at present vested in the Police. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting   Road  Traffic  Ordinance  also   contains\r\n\r\nprovisions   governing  the  use  by   vehicles   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's highways, as, for example, the provision\r\n\r\nof  parking places; the emplacement of road  traffic\r\n\r\nsigns; and the restrictions placed from time to time\r\n\r\non   the  use  of  roads.  In  connection  with  the\r\n\r\noperation of these provisions, the highway authority\r\n\r\nis  the  City Council, and the Police, who have  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  responsibility for the operation  of  these\r\n\r\nprovisions,   are   required   to   exercise    such\r\n\r\nresponsibility  in  consultation   with   the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Municipal and Local Government\r\n\r\nOrdinances  contain provisions for the  registration\r\n\r\nand  licensing of non-motor vehicles such as  carts,\r\n\r\ntrishaws  and  bicycles. There are  also  provisions\r\n\r\nregulating  the conduct of personnel who drive  such\r\n\r\nvehicles,  as well as provisions which regulate  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  public  service  vehicles,  as,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  hired cars or taxis as they  are  commonly\r\n\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, may I briefly state the situation which\r\n\r\nwill  arise  on integration? The City  Council  will\r\n\r\ncease  to exist. Responsibility for the Registry  of\r\n\r\nVehicles  will  he transferred to the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  portfolio. The Municipal  Ordinance  and\r\n\r\nthe Local Government Ordinance will be repealed, and\r\n\r\nit   will   be  clearly  necessary  for  alternative\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  be  enacted to  replace  all  those\r\n\r\nprovisions,  under which the Registrar  of  Vehicles\r\n\r\nfunctions   at  present,  in  respect  of  non-motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  and  of  public service vehicles.  I  must\r\n\r\nexplain,  Sir,  that although the direct  effect  of\r\n\r\nintegration will be the transfer of the Registry  of\r\n\r\nVehicles  from  the City Council to the  Government,\r\n\r\nthere   have  also  been  other  operations   which,\r\n\r\nalthough they have no direct bearing on integration,\r\n\r\nhave nevertheless been undertaken in the context  of\r\n\r\nsuch integration. First, the responsibility for  the\r\n\r\nissue   of   ordinary  driving  licences   will   be\r\n\r\ntransferred  from  the Police to  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles.   Secondly,   whereas   at   present   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for enforcement of the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe Road Traffic Ordinance is shared between the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice  and the Registrar, this responsibility  will\r\n\r\nin  future  devolve wholely on the Police.  Thirdly,\r\n\r\nthe function of compounding traffic offences will be\r\n\r\ntransferred from the Police, who now exercise it, to\r\n\r\nDistrict Judges and Magistrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is empowered to make rules to prescribe, inter alia, the offences which may be\r\n\r\ncompounded  and the amount which may be  offered  by\r\n\r\nway  of  composition in respect of any such offence.\r\n\r\nIt  is proposed to set out in such rules a scale  of\r\n\r\namounts  which may be offered by way of  composition\r\n\r\nfor such offences, and, within the limits specified,\r\n\r\nDistrict   Judges   and   Magistrates   will    have\r\n\r\ndiscretionary  power  to offer  the  offenders  such\r\n\r\namounts as they think fit with a view to compounding\r\n\r\nthe  offences  in  question.  For  any  compoundable\r\n\r\ntraffic  offence  which is repeated,  the  scale  of\r\n\r\ncomposition  rates will he increased  for  a  second\r\n\r\noffence and for third and subsequent offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add, Sir, that in amending the Road\r\n\r\nTraffic Ordinance the opportunity has been taken  to\r\n\r\nbring  certain  traffic offences in  line  with  the\r\n\r\nlegislation  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya.  It  is  also  proposed   to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  system  of  service  of  summonses  by\r\n\r\nregistered  post,  which  is  designed  to  conserve\r\n\r\nPolice manpower. Further, the provisions of the Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Ordinance are to be extended to two  areas,\r\n\r\nthe Naval Base and Pulau Bukom, with the concurrence\r\n\r\nof the authorities concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like, for a moment, to\r\n\r\nrevert  to  the  subject  of  the  registration  and\r\n\r\nlicensing of non-motor vehicles which was previously\r\n\r\ncarried  out  under the provisions of the  Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  but  which, as the Bill now  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse envisages, will in future be carried out under\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Road Traffic Ordinance.  Now,\r\n\r\nSir,  a  perusal  of  Part I of  the  existing  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Ordinance  will  show  that  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nalready provides satisfactory machinery for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollection  of  revenue by way of  registration  and\r\n\r\nlicence in respect of motor vehicles. It seemed both\r\n\r\nsimple  and appropriate to adapt this machinery  for\r\n\r\nthe  collection of revenue in respect  of  non-motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  as well. Under the existing provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe   Municipal   Ordinance  and  Local   Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance, non-motor vehicles (except bicycles) were\r\n\r\neither  registered  annually or taxed  annually,  or\r\n\r\nboth. In future, it is proposed that these non-motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  (except bicycles) will be treated  exactly\r\n\r\nin  the same way as motor vehicles, that is to  say,\r\n\r\nregistered once and for all and licensed  annually.\r\n\r\nThe  method  adopted in the Bill  was  generally  to\r\n\r\nremove the word \"motor\" from the provisions of  Part\r\n\r\nI  of the Road Traffic Ordinance, which, ipso facto,\r\n\r\nmakes  that  Part  applicable to all  vehicles.  The\r\n\r\nlevel  and quantum of licence fees will be  designed\r\n\r\nso  that  these  fees  will be equated  to  the  tax\r\n\r\npreviously paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The licensing of public service vehicles - taxis\r\n\r\nand  buses - is a quite separate exercise, and  a  new\r\n\r\nPart  II  has been introduced in the Bill  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.  This new Part reproduces the corresponding\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Local Government Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the transfer from the Police to the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Vehicles of the function  of  issuing\r\n\r\ndriving licences, the deletion of references to  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Commissioner of Police, who was the previous\r\n\r\nlicensing officer, and the substitution therefor  of\r\n\r\nreferences to the Registrar of Vehicles in  sections\r\n\r\n13  to  21  of  the  Road Traffic  Ordinance  (which\r\n\r\ncorrespond  to  clauses 13 to 21 of  the  Bill)  has\r\n\r\ngiven effect to the intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of roads in section 2 of the Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Ordinance has been amended, as hon. Members\r\n\r\nwill  observe  on  a  perusal of the  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"road\"  in  clause  2  of the  Bill.  A  \"road\"  now\r\n\r\nincludes any road in Pulau Bukom and any road within\r\n\r\nthe  Naval Base. As I explained earlier, the  effect\r\n\r\nof  this definition will be to extend the provisions\r\n\r\nof the Road Traffic Ordinance to these two areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to draw the attention of\r\n\r\nhon.  Members to clauses 24 to 28 of the Bill  which\r\n\r\nrelate  to  reckless or dangerous  driving;  driving\r\n\r\nwithout   due   care  or  reasonable  consideration;\r\n\r\ncausing  death  by  reckless or  dangerous  driving;\r\n\r\ndriving while under the influence of drink or drugs;\r\n\r\nand  being  in charge of a motor vehicle when  under\r\n\r\nthe  influence of drink or drugs. These  provisions,\r\n\r\nas  I mentioned earlier, have been brought into line\r\n\r\nwith  Federation and United Kingdom legislation.  It\r\n\r\nis  worthy  of note that a specific penalty  is  now\r\n\r\nprovided  for  causing  death  by  driving  a  motor\r\n\r\nvehicle  recklessly or at a speed  or  in  a  manner\r\n\r\nwhich is dangerous to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the amendments to which I have\r\n\r\nreferred, the Road Traffic Bill retains the form and\r\n\r\nsubstance of the present Road Traffic Ordinance. For\r\n\r\nconvenience of reference, I have caused to be placed\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of  each  clause  of  the  Bill  which\r\n\r\ncorresponds  to  a  section  in  the  Road   Traffic\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  the  section number  of  the  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nexcept in cases where the provision is a new one not\r\n\r\npreviously contained in the Ordinance or is based on\r\n\r\nother legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere is only one aspect of the Bill which I wish to\r\n\r\ndeal  with and which the Minister passed over  quite\r\n\r\ncursorily in his Second reading speech. That is  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the removal of the power  to  compound\r\n\r\nfrom  the Police into the hands of a District  Judge\r\n\r\nor  a  Magistrate.  Sir, I am  not  questioning  the\r\n\r\ndesirability  of  the  provision  of  the  power  to\r\n\r\ncompound,  but what is exercising my mind,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nwhether  it is desirable to transfer this  power  to\r\n\r\ncompound  from the Police, as it now  exists,  to  a\r\n\r\nDistrict Judge or a Magistrate. I had hoped that the\r\n\r\nMinister would give some reason for this transfer of\r\n\r\npower   from  the  Police  to  a  Magistrate,   but,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, he did not touch upon it.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow whether the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare, on principle, objecting to a Government servant\r\n\r\nexercising  the power to compound, or  whether  they\r\n\r\nare thinking that the power to compound in the hands\r\n\r\nof  a  District Judge or a Magistrate might be  used\r\n\r\nmore  expeditiously and to the satisfaction  of  all\r\n\r\nparties concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard in this House how difficult it\r\n\r\nis  to get work through the Courts, because they are\r\n\r\ncongested, and the difficulty of getting Magistrates\r\n\r\nand District Judges. If that is a correct statement,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I am wondering whether a transfer\r\n\r\nof  the  power  to compound from the Police  to  the\r\n\r\nMagistracy would not involve the Magistracy in  more\r\n\r\nwork  and,  therefore,  tend  to  inconvenience  the\r\n\r\npublic  in  so far as these offences in  respect  of\r\n\r\nwhich  compositions could be effected are concerned.\r\n\r\nI  myself do not know how many of such offences  are\r\n\r\ncompounded per day or per week, but if the number is\r\n\r\nlarge,  Mr Speaker, Sir, then I feel that  possibly\r\n\r\nthis  provision,  however desirable  it  may  be  in\r\n\r\nprinciple, might lead to the position where, because\r\n\r\nof  the bottleneck in the District Courts, work will\r\n\r\nbe  held up. Now, the clause as worded here  in  the\r\n\r\nBill, Mr Speaker, Sir, envisages the offences being\r\n\r\nspotted  by  the  Traffic  Police,  and  where   the\r\n\r\noffences  are  of  a  nature  where  compounding  is\r\n\r\npossible,  then  I take it the Traffic  Police  will\r\n\r\nthen  refer  them  to  the  District  Judge  or  the\r\n\r\nMagistrate  as  the  case  may  be,  and  then   the\r\n\r\nMagistrate,  I take it, would have to issue  notices\r\n\r\nto the persons concerned offering them a composition\r\n\r\nin  respect of the offence. All this means  work  in\r\n\r\nthe Magistracy, and whether that is going to lead to\r\n\r\na  bottleneck  and clogging up of the  clearance  of\r\n\r\nthese  offences, I myself am not in  a  position  to\r\n\r\nsay. But I pose the question to the Minister, and if\r\n\r\nhe is reasonably satisfied that this is not going to\r\n\r\ncause  dislocation, then I have nothing  further  to\r\n\r\nsay.  But  I  wish to make this point, that  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is introducing clause 79 merely  because\r\n\r\nit  objects to a Government servant exercising  this\r\n\r\npower, then I would like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto remind the Hon. the Minister that under the\r\n\r\nCustoms Ordinance the power to compound is still\r\n\r\nwith the Senior Customs Officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishes to speak?

To  prevent  the\r\n\r\nPolice  from being cluttered up with a lot  of  this\r\n\r\nwork,  it is provided that the Minister should  make\r\n\r\nRules  setting out the circumstances under which  an\r\n\r\noffence can be compounded and also the limits of the\r\n\r\nfines  in  respect  of  the offences  which  can  be\r\n\r\ncompounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been found that the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police  tend to deal with  these  cases  of\r\n\r\ncompounding  in  a very perfunctory manner.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  brought  to my attention that sometimes  first\r\n\r\noffenders are fined the maximum that is provided for\r\n\r\nthe offence under the present system of compounding.\r\n\r\nIt  is provided that the Minister can make Rules for\r\n\r\nthe compounding of these offences. The limits of the\r\n\r\nfines  can  be  set  out under  these  Rules  and  a\r\n\r\ngraduated  scale  of fines worked  out.  Under  this\r\n\r\nsystem, it will be quite easy for the District Judge\r\n\r\nor   the   Magistrate  to  assess  the  penalty   if\r\n\r\ncompounding is allowed. Say there is a first offence\r\n\r\nof  driving without lights. In that case,  the  fine\r\n\r\nfor that particular type of offence can be laid down\r\n\r\nin  the  graduated scale of fines. If it occurs  for\r\n\r\nthe first time,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  all  that the District Judge or the Magistrate\r\n\r\nwill  be required to do is to say that he imposes  a\r\n\r\npenalty of $5. If it happens a second time,  he  can\r\n\r\nincrease the fine according to the graduated  scale.\r\n\r\nIn  these Rules, it can also be provided that  if  a\r\n\r\nmotorist has taken due heed of his previous breaches\r\n\r\nof the traffic regulations - say after a period of one\r\n\r\nor more years he has a clean slate - but he is brought\r\n\r\nup  again,  then he cannot be fined the maximum  for\r\n\r\nthe  offence  but  he  can be  treated  as  a  first\r\n\r\noffender.  That  is the purpose  of  this  scale  of\r\n\r\nfines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it will\r\n\r\nlead  to  the  Police  Courts and  the  Magistrates'\r\n\r\nCourts  being  concerned with a  greater  amount  of\r\n\r\nwork. I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, that that will meet\r\n\r\nthe objections of the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take it that as the\r\n\r\nenforcing  authority  under  this  Bill  will  still\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be the Traffic Police, therefore,  the\r\n\r\noffence  in respect of which the powers to compound\r\n\r\nwill  arise will necessarily come to the  notice  of\r\n\r\nthe  police  in  the  first  instance.  The  present\r\n\r\nposition  is  this. The offence having come  to  the\r\n\r\nnotice  of  the Traffic Police, they might  issue  a\r\n\r\nnotice to compound from the Office itself. But under\r\n\r\nthe  altered  system envisaged  by  clause  79,  the\r\n\r\npolice,  having come to know of such a  compoundable\r\n\r\noffence,  will have to take that offence  away  from\r\n\r\nits  own  Department  and carry  it  (possibly  some\r\n\r\ndepartmental  instruction will go with  it)  to  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Court  may be, either the Traffic  District\r\n\r\nJudge  or any Magistrate there. And I take  it  that\r\n\r\nevery  Monday  morning,  or  Wednesday  morning,  or\r\n\r\nFriday  morning, as the case may be, there  will  be\r\n\r\nthis  traffic  officer with all  these  compoundable\r\n\r\noffences,  and he will have to interview either  the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Judge or the Magistrate, and  give  him  a\r\n\r\nlist  of  all these offences. Whereupon the District\r\n\r\nJudge  or  the Magistrate will then have to instruct\r\n\r\nhis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nusher  or  somebody in his section to prepare  these\r\n\r\nnotices  to the various offenders, offering  them  a\r\n\r\ncomposition.  The traffic offender  can  refuse  the\r\n\r\ncomposition,  and if he does, then, of  course,  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police will have to determine whether  they\r\n\r\nwish  to  lodge  a  prosecution  against  him.   So,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  you  get these two extra  administrative\r\n\r\nsteps  which become necessary if clause  79  becomes\r\n\r\nlaw.  It tends to increase the administrative  work,\r\n\r\nalthough  I  appreciate the principle enunciated  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Labour and Law  that  where  the\r\n\r\nTraffic Police themselves are, shall I say, catching\r\n\r\nthe offenders, it is not desirable to leave them  to\r\n\r\nadjudicate upon the composition; but that  principle\r\n\r\nhas  been accepted by the Government and it is still\r\n\r\nbeing   carried  out  by  them  under  the   Customs\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  There  are customs  officers  going  for\r\n\r\ncustoms offences, and yet the senior customs officer\r\n\r\nis  given authority to compound. So, therefore, that\r\n\r\nprinciple in itself cannot be raised in this matter,\r\n\r\nbecause that has been conceded by the Government  so\r\n\r\nfar as the Customs Department is concerned. However,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do not wish to press the point. But I  only\r\n\r\nraise it because I thought it might affect the  easy\r\n\r\nmanner in which these cases have been dealt with.  I\r\n\r\nremember when this question was first mooted in  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Council, I think it was some  seven  or\r\n\r\neight  years  ago, the reason why  the  police  were\r\n\r\ngiven this power was for them to get all these minor\r\n\r\ntraffic offences out of the District Courts  or  the\r\n\r\nPolice Courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all these are\r\n\r\nadministrative duties that we are taking  away  from\r\n\r\nthe  Traffic  Police; they are concerned  only  with\r\n\r\nenforcement.

Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself\r\n\r\ninto a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Byrne].\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>STAMP (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I signify\r\n\r\nthat  I  have received the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's\r\n\r\nrecommendation that the Bill be proceeded with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of the Bill is to bring the Stamp\r\n\r\nOrdinance up-to-date in the\r\n\r\nlight  of  past  experience  in  order  to  overcome\r\n\r\ncertain  administrative difficulties encountered  in\r\n\r\nthe past, and to improve\r\n\r\nefficiency in administering the Stamp Ordinance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to eliminate unnecessary delay and\r\n\r\nadministrative inconvenience, it\r\n\r\nis  now  proposed  to  empower the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nStamps to delegate the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npowers,  functions and duties vested in him  by  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance to any person\r\n\r\nhaving   official   duty   or   employed   in    the\r\n\r\nadmimstration of the Stamp Ordinance.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, it is proposed to transfer the\r\n\r\npowers to authorise the\r\n\r\nofficer  in  charge  of any Stamp  Office  to  issue\r\n\r\nimprest stamps, to issue a licence giving permission\r\n\r\nto use a franking\r\n\r\nmachine to pay stamp duty and to authorise any  bank\r\n\r\ndoing business in\r\n\r\nSingapore to compound for the payment of duty on any\r\n\r\nunstamped cheques,\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister to the Commissioner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also aims at tightening up the provisions\r\n\r\nto deal with evasion more\r\n\r\neffectively.  It provides that only  stamps  of  the\r\n\r\nState  of  Singapore shall be used  for  payment  of\r\n\r\nstamp  duty.  At  present  the  Ordinance  does  not\r\n\r\nspecify the\r\n\r\nperiod  within which an instrument should be stamped\r\n\r\nafter adjudication by\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner  so that the Commissioner  has  no\r\n\r\npower to compel the taxpayer  to  have such instrument stamped  within  any\r\n\r\nspecified period. Clause 6 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  provides  that such instrument  shall  be\r\n\r\nstamped within 14 days after\r\n\r\nnotice  of  the assessment made by the Commissioner,\r\n\r\nor within 14 days after\r\n\r\nthe  issue of the Order of the High Court or  within\r\n\r\nsuch further period specified\r\n\r\nby  the  Commissioner or High Court as the case  may\r\n\r\nbe. This will assist the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  in the collection of duty  payable  by\r\n\r\nthe taxpayer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, under section 45 of the Ordinance,\r\n\r\ntransfers, of shares cannot be\r\n\r\nstamped  until the number of shares are entered.  In\r\n\r\nview of the fact that certain\r\n\r\ntypes  of  shares now no longer carry distinguishing\r\n\r\nnumbers, provision is now\r\n\r\nmade  by  clause  7  of  the  Bill  to  empower  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner in suitable cases to permit a  transfer\r\n\r\nof shares to be stamped even though the number of\r\n\r\nshares is not entered in the transfer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill provides that where an\r\n\r\ninstrument is to be stamped\r\n\r\nvvithin  a  certain  period  after  execution,  such\r\n\r\nperiod shall commence on the day\r\n\r\nafter the execution of the instrument.\r\n\r\nClause  11  provides for the right of Government  to\r\n\r\nclaim duty which has\r\n\r\nbeen under-assessed and to recover\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npenalty  in respect of offences committed under  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  and clause 12 is designed to tighten  up\r\n\r\nthe provisions relating to such penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8, 10 and 13 of the Bill provide\r\n\r\nrespectively   for   consequential   amendments   to\r\n\r\nsections  46,  53 and 63 of the Ordinance  following\r\n\r\nthe  revision of the rates of duty under Schedule  A\r\n\r\nby the Stamp (Amendment) Ordinance, 1952.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also gives effect to the proposal to\r\n\r\nraise   the   practising  fee   of   Advocates   and\r\n\r\nSolicitors, which was announced by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance   in  his  Budget  Statement  on  the   29th\r\n\r\nNovember, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Low Por Tuck].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CERTIFICATES (WINDING UP) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as hon. Members can see from the Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement, this Winding Up Bill seeks to wind up the\r\n\r\nCertificates  Fund  constituted  under  the  Victory\r\n\r\nSavings Certificates Ordinance, 1946.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal Ordinance was passed on 10th\r\n\r\nOctober,   1946,   and  under  its  provisions   the\r\n\r\nCertificates  Fund  was set up to  borrow  money  to\r\n\r\nprovide for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreconstruction of capital works after World War  II.\r\n\r\nCertificates were sold at a discounted value of  $15\r\n\r\neach,  and  when they reached maturity in  10  years\r\n\r\nfrom the date of issue, holders were entitled to $20\r\n\r\nper  certificate. Redemptions were allowed any  time\r\n\r\nbefore  the  expiry  of 10 years and  the  surrender\r\n\r\nvalues of a unit certificate were graduated from $15\r\n\r\nwhen  less than one year to $20 on completion of  10\r\n\r\nyears.  Certificates were sold from  1946  to  1950,\r\n\r\nwhen  sales were terminated. The total sale  of  the\r\n\r\ncertificates was only $809,542.50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the buyers of the certificates started\r\n\r\nhanding in their certificates for redemption  within\r\n\r\na  year after the certificates were introduced,  and\r\n\r\nafter 1948 the amount of certificates presented for\r\n\r\nredemption was more than the amount sold. As stated,\r\n\r\nthe  date  of maturity of certificates is  10  years\r\n\r\nfrom date of issue. Since the last certificates were\r\n\r\nsold in 1950, all the certificates sold have matured\r\n\r\nand  no certificates will earn interest after  1960.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is now proposed to wind up the Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains provisions which are largely\r\n\r\nprocedural.  Clause 5 provides that not  later  than\r\n\r\nsix  months after the coming into operation  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, the assets of the Fund shall be converted\r\n\r\ninto   cash  and  used  to  settle  all  outstanding\r\n\r\nprincipal   and  interest  payments  on   unredeemed\r\n\r\ncertificates.  Notice is to be given to  holders  of\r\n\r\nunredeemed certificates so that they will have ample\r\n\r\nwarning that the Fund is going to be wound up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any dispute regarding any payment or\r\n\r\nrepayment,  the  Minister may pay  the  amount  into\r\n\r\ncourt  or  may make other appropriate provision  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all claims have been paid or provided for,\r\n\r\nthe  balance,  if  any,  is to  be  paid  into  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Low Por Tuck].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>(MOTION)</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn sine\r\n\r\ndie.\" -[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">two minutes to Four o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
