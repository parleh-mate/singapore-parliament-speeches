A\r\n\r\nproposal  to make up this portion of the  road  to\r\n\r\nkampong  road standard at a cost of $4,000  to  be\r\n\r\npaid  by the Government was not supported  by  the\r\n\r\nUrban and Rural Services Committee when it met  on\r\n\r\n19th July, 1967. Instead, the U.R.S.C, recommended\r\n\r\nthat  the  Director of the Public Works Department\r\n\r\nshould consider making up this portion of the road\r\n\r\nunder   section   19   of  the  Local   Government\r\n\r\nIntegration Ordinance and charge the cost  to  the\r\n\r\nfrontagers. The Projects Committee at its  meeting\r\n\r\nof  7th  August, 1967, accepted and  approved  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the U.R.S.C, and  duly  notified\r\n\r\nthe  Director  of the Public Works  Department  of\r\n\r\nthis  decision. Investigation by the P.W.D, showed\r\n\r\nthat there are shophouses along both sides of this\r\n\r\nportion of the road which has a width varying from\r\n\r\n25  feet  to 33 feet. This width is less than  the\r\n\r\nminimum of 36 feet required for any street when it\r\n\r\nis  made up under section 19. As the road can only\r\n\r\nbe  widened if some of the existing structures are\r\n\r\ndemolished, notices under section 19 have not been\r\n\r\nissued. However, it is intended to repair the road\r\n\r\nunder   section   22   of  the  Local   Government\r\n\r\nIntegration Ordinance.

We  have also decided to  withdraw  our\r\n\r\nForces from the Persian Gulf by the same date. The\r\n\r\nbroad  effect  is that, apart from  our  remaining\r\n\r\nDependencies    and   certain   other    necessary\r\n\r\nexceptions,   we  shall  by  that  date   not   be\r\n\r\nmaintaning military bases outside Europe  and  the\r\n\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, by that date, we shall have withdrawn our\r\n\r\nforces  from Malaysia and Singapore. We have  told\r\n\r\nboth Governments that we do not thereafter plan to\r\n\r\nretain  a special military capability for  use  in\r\n\r\nthe  area. But we have assured them both, and  our\r\n\r\nother  Commonwealth partners and allies concerned,\r\n\r\nthat we shall retain a general capability based in\r\n\r\nEurope - including the United Kingdom\r\n\r\n-     which  can be deployed overseas as,  in  our\r\n\r\njudgment, circumstances demand, including  support\r\n\r\nfor  United Nations operations. During his  recent\r\n\r\nvisit  to  Kuala Lumpur, my right hon. Friend  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  Secretary  told  the  Government  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia that we wish to reach a new understanding\r\n\r\nwith   them  about  the  Anglo-Malaysian   Defence\r\n\r\nAgreement  so  as  to  make  it  fit  the  changed\r\n\r\nconditions.  As  the  House knows,  the  Agreement\r\n\r\ncontains  provisions for a review of this  nature.\r\n\r\nHe also assured the other Commonwealth Governments\r\n\r\nconcerned of Britain's continued interest  in  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of security in South-East  Asia,  with\r\n\r\nthe   forces   which  will  be   available   here.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, if our Commonwealth partners so  desire\r\n\r\nand  mutually  satisfactory  arrangements  can  be\r\n\r\nmade,  we  would  be prepared to  assist  them  in\r\n\r\nestablishing a future joint air defence system for\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and Singapore and in training  personnel\r\n\r\nto operate it.

And long  before\r\n\r\nthe 31st of December, 1971, we will have developed\r\n\r\na  sufficient  defence capability  to  make  us  a\r\n\r\ndependable and a desirable partner in any  defence\r\n\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would other\r\n\r\npeople   find  it  credible  that  we  can  defend\r\n\r\nourselves by the end of\r\n\r\n1971?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some people\r\n\r\ndid  not  find  it credible as late as  March  and\r\n\r\nApril  1966 that we could develop sufficient  land\r\n\r\nforces in order to look after ourselves by the end\r\n\r\nof 1967. But I can assure the hon. Member that the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister of Malaysia found it  fully\r\n\r\ncredible that Singapore had sufficient land forces\r\n\r\nto  look after itself. In a letter to our Minister\r\n\r\nof  Defence  dated the 14th of November explaining\r\n\r\nwhy the Malaysians were withdrawing not only their\r\n\r\nbattalion at Khatib but all their other units, the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister of Malaysia said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I also understand that since the separation of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   the  Government  of   Singapore   has\r\n\r\nincreased its Armed Forces for purpose of  defence\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.

This duty, which applies to  trusts\r\n\r\nand similar types of bodies where property is held\r\n\r\npermanently in such manner that no tax is  payable\r\n\r\nsince no property ever passes on on the death of a\r\n\r\nperson,  was  originally complementary  to  estate\r\n\r\nduty  which provided for a levy in respect of  the\r\n\r\nestate of deceased persons only.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law stands, it covers movable or immovable\r\n\r\nproperty   in  Singapore  and  outside  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhereas  in the case of estate duty the  scope  of\r\n\r\nthe   charge   specifically   excludes   immovable\r\n\r\nproperty outside Singapore. The revenue collection\r\n\r\nfrom this duty in 1966 was $55,954.68, and in 1967\r\n\r\n(up   to  November  1967)  was  $55,706.45.   This\r\n\r\ncollection   is   not  substantial   taking   into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  cost  involved.  It   is   now\r\n\r\nproposed  to repeal the Corporation Duty Ordinance\r\n\r\nbecause  the  exemptions provided in the  law  are\r\n\r\nsuch that a very small class of property is liable\r\n\r\nto  charge.  Property of religious and  charitable\r\n\r\norganisations   and  property   constituting   the\r\n\r\ncapital  of a body corporate or unincorporate  for\r\n\r\ntrade or business are exempt.

Members   are  already  aware   that   the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of British forces from Singapore  will\r\n\r\nrender  a large number of workers unemployed.  The\r\n\r\nHouse  has  just heard a statement  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  that the British have again notified  us\r\n\r\nthat  they will further cut short their  stay  and\r\n\r\nthat they will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  completely out by the end of 1971. This means,\r\n\r\nfrom   the  employment  angle,  that  some  30,000\r\n\r\ncivilian  employees in the British bases  together\r\n\r\nwith  some  10,000  women and  girls  employed  by\r\n\r\nServices families as domestic help will lose their\r\n\r\njobs by 1971. The great majority of these Services\r\n\r\nemployees are our citizens and the loss  of  their\r\n\r\njobs  will most certainly bring to them  a  fairly\r\n\r\nlong  period of uncertainty and confusion; and  in\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the workers, it is necessary  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  be prudent and conserve their  money  to\r\n\r\ntide  them for as long as possible over the period\r\n\r\nof unemployment pending re-training for new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On becoming redundant, most of the employees\r\n\r\nwill  get  a  sizable sum of money  as  redundancy\r\n\r\npayments.   Many  of  them  are  unaccustomed   to\r\n\r\nhandling  substantial sums of  money  at  any  one\r\n\r\ntime.  The Government is primarily concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe  citizen employees, and the basic aim of  this\r\n\r\nlegislation  is  to  ensure that  the  money  they\r\n\r\nreceive  is  not  used unwisely and injudiciously,\r\n\r\nwhich  will make them destitutes in a short period\r\n\r\nand  bring them and their families great distress.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  period of trial and tribulation,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is responsible for ensuring  that  its\r\n\r\ncitizens  are adequately fed, clothed and  housed,\r\n\r\nand  this  is  precisely what the  Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\nensure for the workers. I must emphasise here that\r\n\r\nit  is not the intention of the Government to take\r\n\r\naway the redundancy payments from the workers  and\r\n\r\nuse  the money as revenue. I must assure the House\r\n\r\nthat  the Government will not and cannot make  use\r\n\r\nof  the money, for the redundancy payments will be\r\n\r\npaid into the Redundancy Payments Fund established\r\n\r\nby  law. This Fund will be fully utilised for  the\r\n\r\nfull benefit of employees who become redundant  to\r\n\r\nadapt  and  adjust themseves to a  new  situation.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  the  administration  of  the  Fund   will\r\n\r\ninvolve   the   Government  in   extra   financial\r\n\r\nexpenditure. An interest rate of 5\u00bc per  cent  per\r\n\r\nannum  is  guaranteed even if the returns  derived\r\n\r\nfrom  the Fund are insufficient to defray  the  in\r\n\r\nterest due to members of the Fund.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn  such a case, the deficiency is charged on  and\r\n\r\npaid out of the Consolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important feature of the Bill is that money\r\n\r\npaid  into and out of the Fund will be exempt from\r\n\r\nincome  tax. There are also provisions to  protect\r\n\r\nthe rights of the workers so that their money will\r\n\r\nnot be taken away by creditors or moneylenders.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  illustrate here,  by  way  of  an\r\n\r\nexample,  how the income tax exemption will  bring\r\n\r\nabout  savings  to  an employee.  If  an  employee\r\n\r\nearning  a salary of $500 per month, with  a  wife\r\n\r\nand  three  children, gets a lump sum payment  of,\r\n\r\nsay, $20,000, he will have to pay about $3,200  in\r\n\r\nincome tax, but with the exemption from income tax\r\n\r\nas  provided in this Bill, this sum will be  saved\r\n\r\nby such an employee.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"employer\" in the Act covers\r\n\r\npractically all employers in Singapore. But it  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  intention of Government  at  present  to\r\n\r\napply this Act to the private and public sectors.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the Bill provides for the establishment\r\n\r\nof  a  Fund  to be called the Redundancy  Payments\r\n\r\nFund. Employers are required to put all redundancy\r\n\r\npayments of their workers into this Fund.  Out  of\r\n\r\nthis  Fund the redundant worker may draw up to  60\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  his  former wages  every  month.  A\r\n\r\ncitizen can keep on drawing until all his money in\r\n\r\nthe  Fund  is exhausted. A non-Singapore  citizen,\r\n\r\nhowever, can only draw up to two-thirds of his  re\r\n\r\ndundancy  payment, leaving a balance of  one-third\r\n\r\nin  the  Fund. The purpose of retaining this  one-third  of  his  money is that if he is  unable  to\r\n\r\nobtain  further employment in Singapore, he  will\r\n\r\nhave  sufficient money in the Fund for his passage\r\n\r\nback to his home country. On the other hand, if he\r\n\r\ndecides to leave Singapore permanently and has  no\r\n\r\nintention  of returning, he can straightaway  draw\r\n\r\nout  all the money standing to his credit  in  the\r\n\r\nFund.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore citizens there are provisions to\r\n\r\nwithdraw lump sums from the Fund. If a citizen can\r\n\r\nprove that he is making use of the money for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  useful projects, such as buying a  house  or\r\n\r\nentering into a business venture, he can have  his\r\n\r\nmoney withdrawn for that purpose. I would like  to\r\n\r\nassure  the  House that we will try to  administer\r\n\r\nthis  Fund  as flexibly as possible so as  not  to\r\n\r\ncause hardship to our citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above, hon. Members will see that\r\n\r\neventually  every single cent will be returned  to\r\n\r\nthe workers plus any interest that may accrue.  In\r\n\r\naddition, the workers enjoy exemption from  income\r\n\r\ntax  and their money is kept out of reach of their\r\n\r\ncreditors and moneylenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Bill last month,\r\n\r\nthe   National  Trades  Union  Congress  and   the\r\n\r\nServices' Unions have made lengthy studies of  it.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these studies, they have put up certain  recommendations  to  the  Government.  These\r\n\r\nrecommendations  have  been considered  carefully,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  happy  to say that most  of  them  are\r\n\r\nacceptable  to the Government. I shall  be  moving\r\n\r\namendments   at   Committee   stage    to    cover\r\n\r\ncircumstances  of  proven  hardship  as  well   as\r\n\r\nwithdrawals from the Fund by Singapore citizens on\r\n\r\ntheir reaching the age of 55 as recommended by the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other minor recommendations, such as setting\r\n\r\nup  a  Board to consider withdrawals and arranging\r\n\r\nfor payments to be made at the nearest post office\r\n\r\nand so on, can be met by administrative action.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the first time that\r\n\r\nSingapore   is   facing   a   problem   of    such\r\n\r\nunprecedented  magnitude, and  it  is  imperative,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  in a crucial situation  of  this\r\n\r\nsort, urgent steps should be taken to protect  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of so many of our citizens who will  be\r\n\r\naffected.   We  have  surmounted  many   obstacles\r\n\r\nbefore,  and  I  can  assure the  House  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   with   the   co-operation   of   all\r\n\r\nconcerned,   will   be  able   to   overcome   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  that lie ahead by  making  plans  to\r\n\r\nretain  our  workers  for alternative  gainful  em\r\n\r\nployment as speedily as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   in  principle,  the   Redundancy\r\n\r\nPayments Fund Bill is a sound piece of legislation\r\n\r\nas it provides some measure of protection not only\r\n\r\nto  the  victims of redundancy but also  to  their\r\n\r\nfamilies   and  dependants.  The  Bill  can   also\r\n\r\nrestrain  the  recipients of  redundancy  payments\r\n\r\nfrom    spending   their   money   lavishly    and\r\n\r\ninjudiciously and in the end finding it  necessary\r\n\r\nto resort to public assistance from the Social Wel\r\n\r\nfare  Department. It is usual, Mr Speaker, for  a\r\n\r\nperson  to  be  thrifty when his money  is  almost\r\n\r\nspent and to be extravagant when he has much. This\r\n\r\nvery  often happens and there are many such  cases\r\n\r\nto serve as examples. So it is appropriate for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to take steps to prevent  such  people\r\n\r\nfrom  falling  victim  to  such  weaknesses  after\r\n\r\nhaving  already  fallen victim to retrenchment  on\r\n\r\naccount of redundancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However. Mr Speaker, there are certain clauses\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill  which are vague and  which  contain\r\n\r\nunhappy features. For instance, in clause  6  (1) ,\r\n\r\nthe  redundant employee is required  to  authorise\r\n\r\nhis  empolyer, within seven days of  the  relevant\r\n\r\ndate, to pay the redundancy payment into the Fund.\r\n\r\nBut  clause 6 (5) states that if the employee does\r\n\r\nnot,  within  three months of the  relevant  date,\r\n\r\ngive  his  authorisation, the  redundancy  payment\r\n\r\nwill  automatically be paid into the  Fund.  Thus,\r\n\r\nclause 6 appears to have the effect of forcing the\r\n\r\nredundant employee to have his money paid into the\r\n\r\nFund, whether he likes it or not. He has no choice\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage I would like to make a suggestion\r\n\r\non  this  clause  for  the  consideration  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nemployee  should be given one of two choices:  (1)\r\n\r\neither his money be paid into the Fund and thereby\r\n\r\nbe  entitled  to  the 5\u00bc per cent  interest  under\r\n\r\nclause 4 (3) as well as exemption from income  tax\r\n\r\nunder clause 11 (2) of the Bill; or (2) that he be\r\n\r\npermitted  to collect his money from the  employer\r\n\r\non  which he will have to pay income tax due under\r\n\r\nthe  Income  Tax  Ordinance,  in  the  case  of  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen  who  decides  on  the   second\r\n\r\nchoice,  he  should be debarred from  getting  any\r\n\r\nform of assistance from the Government, whether in\r\n\r\nthe form of free textbooks and exemption of school\r\n\r\nfees for his children, public assistance from  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare  Department,  etc.  He  will   not\r\n\r\nreceive  such  public assistance  for  a  specific\r\n\r\nperiod,  the length of which should be similar  to\r\n\r\nthat  during  which his credits in the  Fund  will\r\n\r\nlast,  as if his redundancy payment had been  paid\r\n\r\ninto  the  Fund.  For  a  non-citizen,  Sir,   the\r\n\r\nquestion of assistance in any case does not  arise\r\n\r\nby reason of his non-citizen ship status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 sets out the monthly payment to the\r\n\r\nemployee, which will not exceed 60 per cent of his\r\n\r\nusual  wages, in the case of a Singapore  citizen,\r\n\r\npayments  will continue until his credits  in  the\r\n\r\nFund  are  exhausted. But in the case  of  a  non-citizen, payments will be made up to two-thirds of\r\n\r\nhis  redundancy  payment; the remaining  one-third\r\n\r\nbeing  payable  to  him upon  the  Director  being\r\n\r\nsatisfied that he is about to leave Singapore  and\r\n\r\nwill not return any more.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an employee who earns, say, $350 a month,\r\n\r\nthe  proportion  of his monthly  payment  will  be\r\n\r\n$210,  and with this sum he can manage to maintain\r\n\r\nhis  family.  But  what about the  employee  whose\r\n\r\nnormal wages are, say, $200 or less per month?  He\r\n\r\nwill only get $120 or less a month. Is that amount\r\n\r\nsufficient  for  him to support his  family?  What\r\n\r\nabout those non-citizens whose children were  born\r\n\r\nin  Singapore? Is it proper that, by reason of the\r\n\r\nfather being a non-citizen, the children who  were\r\n\r\nborn in Singapore should suffer distress?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 says that only a Singapore citizen\r\n\r\nmay,  if  the Director is satisfied, withdraw  his\r\n\r\nmoney   from   the  Fund  to  purchase   immovable\r\n\r\nproperty,  or to enter into any trade or business,\r\n\r\nwhilst  a non-citizen may not do so. The  fact  is\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no existing law that  debars  non-citizens   from  buying  immovable   property   or\r\n\r\ncarrying on trade or business in the Republic.  If\r\n\r\nwe  ponder  carefully, Sir, among the businessmen.\r\n\r\ninvestors,  and entrepreneurs in the  Republic,  a\r\n\r\ngood  many  of them are non-citizens. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthe   Government  is  encouraging  investors  from\r\n\r\noverseas  and  providing incentives  for  them  in\r\n\r\nrespect of citizenship and tax reliefs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other pertinent matter which disturbs me is\r\n\r\nthat  the  employee, that is to say, the Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen, is allowed to purchase immovable property\r\n\r\nor  to  enter into any trade or business.  I  fear\r\n\r\nthat  he  may suffer in the end. It is conceivable\r\n\r\nthat with the money he withdraws he can afford  to\r\n\r\nbuy  property, but can he afford the cost  of  its\r\n\r\nmaintenance,  such  as property tax,  assessments,\r\n\r\nrenovations, and repairs? Similarly, he can afford\r\n\r\nto  use the money as capital if he embarks on  any\r\n\r\ntrade  or business. But has he the necessary know-how   and  experience  in  matters  of  trade  and\r\n\r\nbusiness,  bearing in mind that he has  all  along\r\n\r\nbeen   a  white-collar  worker  or  an  industrial\r\n\r\nworker? Thus his new venture might well end up  as\r\n\r\na misadventure instead.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I suggest to the Government that\r\n\r\nif  it  wishes to safeguard the victims of British\r\n\r\nmilitary  withdrawal  in  line  with  its   avowed\r\n\r\nprinciples of democratic socialism, then it should\r\n\r\nset up a public corporation or industry managed by\r\n\r\nand  under  the  supervision of experts  from  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board, and offer its  shares\r\n\r\nto  these  redundant employees as well as  to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public.  This  will  not  only  help   to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  and protect their interests,  but  also\r\n\r\nenhance  the  prosperity of  Singapore  after  the\r\n\r\nBritish withdrawal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the Redundancy Payments Fund\r\n\r\nBill. I quite appreciate that the economic and\r\n\r\nother difficulties confronting Singapore,\r\n\r\nconsequent upon the wholesale accelerated\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of the British Military Forces from the\r\n\r\nRepublic, render it necessary to have a Bill such\r\n\r\nas the one before the House. To minimise such\r\n\r\ndifficulties, the Singapore Government has\r\n\r\ninitiated a rather unique Bill which some\r\n\r\nirresponsible elements have labelled as a gross\r\n\r\ninfringement of an individual's right to receive\r\n\r\nand use any sum of money payable in respect of his\r\n\r\ntermination of service. This, of course, is a\r\n\r\ndeliberate distortion of the purpose of the\r\n\r\noperation of the proposed Redundancy Payments Fund\r\n\r\nBill which seeks to reconcile and protect the in\r\n\r\nterests of the individual in relation to the wider\r\n\r\ninterests of the Republic. It is quite true that\r\n\r\nthe individual who comes within the scope of the\r\n\r\nproposed Bill finds that the right to receive and\r\n\r\nuse any retrenchment benefits payable to him as he\r\n\r\nwishes has been curtailed to a certain extent.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, balanced against the\r\n\r\ncurtailment is the exemption of such retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits from taxation under the Income Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance and protection from the harassment by\r\n\r\nmoneylenders. These are two significant benefits\r\n\r\nwhich are given in consideration of the compulsory\r\n\r\npayment of the retrenchment benefits into the\r\n\r\nproposed Redundancy Fund and should not be\r\n\r\noverlooked in any discussion of the merits of the\r\n\r\nproposed Act. I also quite appreciate that the\r\n\r\nprincipal intention behind the proposed Act, as I\r\n\r\nsee it, is to help prevent persons who are\r\n\r\nunemployed as a result of the situation of\r\n\r\nredundancy arising in their place of employment,\r\n\r\nfrom becoming a burden on the State. It is not\r\n\r\ndifficult to imagine that the persons on receiving\r\n\r\na sum of money, a sum which is much more\r\n\r\nsubstantial than they have ever laid their hands\r\n\r\non, may squander away such small fortunes\r\n\r\nwastefully\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  rapidly, regardless of the fact that they are\r\n\r\nunemployed.  A  situation  may  result  when  such\r\n\r\npersons and their families, after exhausting their\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefits and have no other  means  of\r\n\r\nsupport,  may join the ranks of destitute  persons\r\n\r\nat  present  drawing  meagre allowances  from  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare Department. It is probably one  of\r\n\r\nthe  reasons responsible for the decision  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not to include in the proposed  Act  a\r\n\r\nprovision  whereby an employee is given an  option\r\n\r\neither to have his retrenchment benefits paid into\r\n\r\nthe   proposed   Fund  comprising  exemption   and\r\n\r\nprotection, or to receive and use such benefits in\r\n\r\nany way as he wishes subject to the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe   Income  Tax  Ordinance  and  harassment   by\r\n\r\nmoneylenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have two comments to make on the proposed\r\n\r\nAct. First is the inclusion of the provision where\r\n\r\nany payment made into and out of the proposed Fund\r\n\r\nis  exempted from the provisions of the Income Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  The  Government  in  making   such   a\r\n\r\nprovision  in the proposed Act must have  realised\r\n\r\nthat  it  means a loss to the Republic of  not  an\r\n\r\ninsignificant amount of revenue. Such exemption is\r\n\r\nextended  as  a means of alleviating the  distress\r\n\r\nand   suffering  of  employees  who  are  rendered\r\n\r\nunemployed  as a result of the withdrawal  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Military Services. But I do not think  it\r\n\r\nis  the  intention  of  the  Government  that  the\r\n\r\noperation of the proposed Act should extend to the\r\n\r\nexpatriate staff of commercial firms. Otherwise we\r\n\r\nwould  have a ridiculous situation where  an  expa\r\n\r\ntriate employee, on expiry of his term of service,\r\n\r\nreturns  to  his country with a not  unsubstantial\r\n\r\namount  of  gratuity and other  payments  untaxed.\r\n\r\nThis  is  obvious from the enabling  provision  of\r\n\r\nclause  16 of the proposed Act where the  Minister\r\n\r\nis given power to exempt an employer or a class of\r\n\r\nemployers from the operation of the proposed Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can, however, foresee some difficulty arising\r\n\r\nfrom  the operation of the exemption under  clause\r\n\r\n16 where the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommercial sector is concerned.  Exemption of an employer having an expatriate staff  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  from the operation of the  proposed\r\n\r\nAct  means  also the exemption of the local  staff\r\n\r\nfrom  the  operation of the proposed Act  together\r\n\r\nwith the expatriate officer. But as the purpose of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  Act  is to help Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\ntide   over   the   period   of   their   probable\r\n\r\nunemployment,  the  purpose of  the  proposed  Act\r\n\r\nseems to be defeated. To me it appears that either\r\n\r\nthe scope of the Act or the provision of clause 16\r\n\r\nis unnecessarily and unduly wide. Either the scope\r\n\r\nof  the  Act should be restricted to those persons\r\n\r\ndirectly  affected by the British withdrawal  from\r\n\r\nSingapore, or the exemption under clause 16 should\r\n\r\nrelate  not to employers but rather to an employee\r\n\r\nor  a  class of employees. The wide scope  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed Act seems unavoidable, but otherwise  the\r\n\r\nproposed   Act  becomes  a  piece  of  legislation\r\n\r\nspecifically   enacted  against  a  selected   and\r\n\r\nrestricted  group of persons. On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nexemption  of  employers rather than of  employees\r\n\r\nappears  unavoidable  because  the  proposed   Act\r\n\r\nplaces  the  onus  on  making  payments  into  the\r\n\r\nproposed  Fund  upon  the employers  and  not  the\r\n\r\nemployees.  I think the problem I have  raised  is\r\n\r\nimportant  and  should  be  resolved  before   the\r\n\r\nproposed Act becomes operative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second comment is the protection afforded to\r\n\r\nany payments into or out of the proposed Fund from\r\n\r\nany  legal proceedings or process in respect of  a\r\n\r\ndebt  or any other claim as provided in clause  11\r\n\r\nof  the  proposed Act. The scope  of  this  clause\r\n\r\nappears  to be very wide and I do not know whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has considered all  the  possible\r\n\r\nconsequences arising from such protection.  It  is\r\n\r\nundoubtedly beneficial that the recipients of  any\r\n\r\npayment  of the proposed Fund should be  protected\r\n\r\nfrom  any  harassment from moneylenders,  but  the\r\n\r\npossible  effect of such provision in relation  to\r\n\r\nsome  statutory  boards, such as the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board, the Public  Utilities  Board,\r\n\r\nmust also be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person who comes within the scope of the\r\n\r\nproposed  Act runs up arrears on his rental  of  a\r\n\r\nHousing  Board flat and is prepared  to  face  the\r\n\r\nconsequence of eviction, particularly in the  case\r\n\r\nof non-citizens who have already made arrangements\r\n\r\nto  leave the country, there seems no way for  the\r\n\r\nBoard  to  recover the arrears of rent.

But I  wonder  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister can clarify the following points. In  the\r\n\r\ncase of a Government pensionable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficer who is retired before the age of 55 due to\r\n\r\nredundancy, he would normally be given a  gratuity\r\n\r\nand  a pension. Would such gratuity be subject  to\r\n\r\nthe control of this Redundancy Payments Fund Bill?\r\n\r\nClause  10 provides that a member of the Fund  who\r\n\r\nis  a  citizen of Singapore may withdraw the whole\r\n\r\nor  part  of  the  redundancy payment  in  certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  The decision to allow  or  not  to\r\n\r\nallow  this  withdrawal rests  entirely  with  the\r\n\r\nDirector whose decision shall be final. This seems\r\n\r\nto  be rather unfair to the redundant employee  as\r\n\r\nit  is  a  one-man  decision.  Will  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider  setting up a board specially to consider\r\n\r\nsuch appeals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 seems to provide excellent protection\r\n\r\nto  the  redundant  employee in  the  use  of  his\r\n\r\nredundancy  payment. But I wish  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider the case of a man who has worked  for  20\r\n\r\nor  30 years and now, on his redundancy at a  very\r\n\r\nlate  stage of his working life, is to be deprived\r\n\r\nof even the small pleasures of life by being given\r\n\r\nunconditionally a small portion of his  redundancy\r\n\r\npayment.  No doubt I appreciate the fact that  his\r\n\r\nredundancy  payment will eventually be given  back\r\n\r\nto  him in full by way of small instalments.  Will\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   consider  giving   the   employee\r\n\r\nimmediately on his redundancy 20 per cent  of  his\r\n\r\nredundancy fund unconditionally?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, right from\r\n\r\nthe  outset,  let me congratuate the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and thank him for accepting almost all  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  proposed by the  National  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion   Congress   for  incorporation   into   the\r\n\r\nRedundancy Payments Fund Bill. When this  proposed\r\n\r\nAct  was  made  public  on its  First  Reading,  a\r\n\r\nhandful   of   individualists  and  one   or   two\r\n\r\nopportunist  politicians attempted to distort  and\r\n\r\ncapitalise  on  the  plight of the  Army  civilian\r\n\r\nworkers  and tried to interpret it as a  piece  of\r\n\r\nanti-labour legislation. These opportunist  politi\r\n\r\ncians, Sir, have never in their lives\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nassociated themselves with the aspirations of  the\r\n\r\nlabour movement or interested themselves in labour\r\n\r\nproblems. Strangely enough, they appear to be very\r\n\r\nmuch alive to the apparent opportunities presented\r\n\r\nby  the  proposed Act for their mischievous talent\r\n\r\nfor  creating and fomenting industrial unrest. The\r\n\r\nreactionary attitude manifested by such characters\r\n\r\nis understandable, for they are interested only in\r\n\r\nthemselves and have no concern for local problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics of this proposed Act are not aware that\r\n\r\nthe   majority   of  these  40,000  odd   civilian\r\n\r\nemployees  do  not  belong 10  the  higher  income\r\n\r\ngroup. I am given to understand, Sir, that 75  per\r\n\r\ncent  of these workers earn about $200 to  $250  a\r\n\r\nmonth only, and with the prospect of an indefinite\r\n\r\nperiod  of  unemployment due  to  the  accelerated\r\n\r\nBritish    military   withdrawal,   a    socialist\r\n\r\ngovernment like the P.A.P. cannot afford to remain\r\n\r\ninactive  and  leave  the  workers  to  fend   for\r\n\r\nthemselves without formulating a constructive  and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive   plan   for  the   protection   and\r\n\r\nsafeguard  of  the workers' retrenchment  benefits\r\n\r\nduring the transitional period. Irresponsible  and\r\n\r\ndisloyal  elements allege that the Government  has\r\n\r\nplans  to  control or takeworkers' money to  raise\r\n\r\nfact, the reverse is the truth, wanting to control\r\n\r\nor  take  workers'  money,  the  Govmaking  a  big\r\n\r\nconcession  in  workers' money,  exempting  paying\r\n\r\nincome  tax when the Redundancy Payments Fund  Act\r\n\r\ncomes into operation.

I  am also glad to  know  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  accepted the N.TUC.'s  additional\r\n\r\nconditions for withdrawals by members of the  Fund\r\n\r\nwho are citizens as and when they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  in  need  of money to meet any  contingencies\r\n\r\naffecting  the  members themselves,  their  wives,\r\n\r\nchildren and parents. Further, any member who is a\r\n\r\ncitizen  of Singapore on reaching the  age  of  55\r\n\r\nyears will be allowed to withdraw the total amount\r\n\r\nstanding to his credit in the Fund if the Director\r\n\r\nis  satisfied  as to the true age of  the  member.\r\n\r\nSir,  nothing  can  be  more flexible  than  this.\r\n\r\nUnlike  the  previous Government, the  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nalways  stood  by and is guided by  its  socialist\r\n\r\nprinciples.  It is loath to introduce  legislation\r\n\r\nto  hoodwink  the public for its own interest.  If\r\n\r\nlegislation has to be introduced which will affect\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of the minority for  the  good  and\r\n\r\nbenefit of the majority and the State, so  be  it,\r\n\r\nfor  we  cannot  afford to do otherwise.  In  this\r\n\r\ncontext, Sir, I remember that in the 1959  general\r\n\r\nelections when the Singapore People's Alliance was\r\n\r\nin  power,  this  clique  deliberately  introduced\r\n\r\nlegislation  to slash the rentals of  tenants  who\r\n\r\nlive  in Singapore Improvement Trust flats with  a\r\n\r\nview to gaining popularity and winning the general\r\n\r\nelections. But the people knew that they were  not\r\n\r\nsincere  and honest. Therefore, no amount of  bene\r\n\r\nficial legislation which is of a temporary measure\r\n\r\nwill  help.  Therefore, one can safely infer  that\r\n\r\nthis  Government,  which is elected  to  power  by\r\n\r\nuniversal   suffrage,   would   not   deliberately\r\n\r\nlegislate laws aimed at bringing hardship  to  the\r\n\r\ncivilian   employees  of  the   British   Military\r\n\r\nServices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments and the proposed\r\n\r\nRedundancy Payments Fund Act, because I am of  the\r\n\r\nopinion  that  the wider interest of the  Republic\r\n\r\nnecessitates such an Act and that the proposed Act\r\n\r\nconfers  some  undoubted benefits on  the  persons\r\n\r\naffected  in return for some flexible restrictions\r\n\r\non their rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I fully support the Bill before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the aim of this Bill to protect the\r\n\r\ncivilian  employees  in the Armed  Forces  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish Government so\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the redundancy payments to be given to  them\r\n\r\nwill be protected by law. The purpose of this Bill\r\n\r\nis  to  look after the livelihood of the employees\r\n\r\nthemselves   as   well  as  their   families   and\r\n\r\ndependants  and to tide them over the difficulties\r\n\r\nwith which they will be faced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timely introduction of this Bill fully shows\r\n\r\nthat   the   Government  has  foresight,  advanced\r\n\r\nplanning and a strong sense of responsibility.  As\r\n\r\na  good Government, we are not only responsible to\r\n\r\nthe   employees  themselves  but  also  to   their\r\n\r\ndependants. Therefore, the Government must  assist\r\n\r\nand  look  after these civilian employees  of  the\r\n\r\nArmed   Forces  and  see  that  their   redundancy\r\n\r\npayments  are  gainfully utilised in  business  or\r\n\r\nwill  tide  them over their difficulties  for  the\r\n\r\ntime being. This is indeed a very wise measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the N.T.U.C., which represents\r\n\r\nthe   democratic  labour  movement,  has   already\r\n\r\nindicated its full support for this Bill.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nthe  unions of the civilian employees in the  Army\r\n\r\nand  Navy have also come out in its support.  They\r\n\r\nare   of  the  view  that  the  Bill  is  a  clear\r\n\r\nindication of the Government's intention to assist\r\n\r\nand  look  after  the long-term  interest  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers as well as their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are certain provisions\r\n\r\nin  this Bill which are particularly of benefit to\r\n\r\nthe  civilian  employees.  First,  the  redundancy\r\n\r\npayments paid into the Fund will earn interest  at\r\n\r\nthe  rate  of 5\u00bc per cent per annum. Second,  such\r\n\r\npayments are exempted from income tax so that they\r\n\r\nare  intact at all times. Third, they are  out  of\r\n\r\nthe   reach   of   creditors   and   moneylenders.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the administration of this Bill  when\r\n\r\nit  becomes  law will result in expenditure  borne\r\n\r\nsolely by the Government without a single cent  of\r\n\r\nthe money paid into the Fund being touched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, certain politicians in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have  come out with adverse  criticisms\r\n\r\nagainst  this  Bill  to  the  effect  that  it  is\r\n\r\nintended  to exploit the workers. This  is  indeed\r\n\r\nmala fide propaganda because it is unfounded.  The\r\n\r\npeople who make this vicious accusation are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunable  to  assist the workers. Their idea  is  to\r\n\r\ncreate confusion and unrest and they hope to  fish\r\n\r\nin troubled waters. These vicious politicians must\r\n\r\nbe  made to understand that their attempt will not\r\n\r\nsucceed   because  the  workers   are   now   more\r\n\r\npolitically  conscious and fully understand  their\r\n\r\nown   circumstances  and  the  situation  in   our\r\n\r\ncountry.  The  workers are fully  aware  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is planning ahead for them and also for\r\n\r\nthe interest of the nation. So they understand the\r\n\r\nimportance of cooperation with the Government.  It\r\n\r\nis  only  when they co-operate with the Government\r\n\r\nthat  we  will be able to tide over this difficult\r\n\r\nperiod.  As  a  matter  of fact,  the  accelerated\r\n\r\nBritish    withdrawal   will   not   only    cause\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in employment but also  in  defence.\r\n\r\nBut  this is a challenge to the will and  guts  of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  I believe that if the  people  stand\r\n\r\nunited together, we will not be afraid to face any\r\n\r\ndifficulties   and  that  finally   we   will   be\r\n\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although I\r\n\r\nwould like to support the purport of this Bill as\r\n\r\nbeing an exceptional measure under exceptional circumstances, there are one or two unhappy features\r\n\r\nabout some clauses of this Bill which I would like\r\n\r\nto bring to the notice of the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to refer to clause 7 which\r\n\r\ndeals with the protection against action given  to\r\n\r\nthe Director and persons authorised by him. In sub-clause  (3)  the  only circumstances  under  which\r\n\r\nprotection  is not granted to the Director  is  in\r\n\r\nthe event of fraud where a person suffering damage\r\n\r\nor  loss can recover whatever loss he has suffered\r\n\r\nfrom   the  Director  by  way  of  possible  legal\r\n\r\nproceedings. Sir, I do not see why the same  thing\r\n\r\ncannot  be done with respect to negligent payments\r\n\r\nmade by the Director or persons authorised by  him\r\n\r\nbecause  if payments are so made and the  Director\r\n\r\nis protected by sub-clause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(2)  as  he is, I do not see why a member  of  the\r\n\r\nFund  should  really have to face the  expense  of\r\n\r\ntaking   action  in  court  for  the  purpose   of\r\n\r\nrecovering the money from the person to whom it is\r\n\r\nwrongfully paid. I think this is an unfair  burden\r\n\r\nto place on members of the Fund. The person who is\r\n\r\nnegligent in making wrong payments should meet the\r\n\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to refer to\r\n\r\nis  the  question of withdrawing the  funds  under\r\n\r\nclauses  9  and  10.  Clause  9  refers   to   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances   under   which   non-citizens   can\r\n\r\nwithdraw their funds, and clause 10 refers to  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  under which citizens  can  withdraw\r\n\r\ntheir funds. I really do not see the reason behind\r\n\r\nthe  two  sets of circumstances - one for citizens\r\n\r\nand  one  for  non-citizens - before  funds  can  be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.  There  are  quite  a  number  of  non-citizens in Singapore who are non-citizens because\r\n\r\nof technical reasons ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come off it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> It is possible that this class\r\n\r\nof  citizens would also be faced with hardship and\r\n\r\nthey  might want to withdraw the money  that  they\r\n\r\nhave in the Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I would\r\n\r\nlike to reply briefly to the points raised by\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Member for Kampong Kernbangan and the Member\r\n\r\nfor Bukit Panjang have raised the point about the\r\n\r\ndifferent treatment accorded to citizens and non-citizens. But I must inform the House that this\r\n\r\nBill is specially designed to protect the interest\r\n\r\nof the citizens and that we do not assume any\r\n\r\nresponsibility\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the non-citizens. I think it is very necessary\r\n\r\nto  have  the two types of withdrawal, because  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of the non-citizen he can withdraw  all\r\n\r\nhis money from the Fund if and when he decides  to\r\n\r\nleave  the  country forever. In fact, we  are  not\r\n\r\ninterested in his money at all. He can  take  away\r\n\r\nall  his  money if he wants to. It will be  better\r\n\r\nfor  us  if he does so. I regret that we  have  to\r\n\r\ntake  this measure, but there is no other  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich we can deal with the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kernbangan has also\r\n\r\nbrought  up the argument that 60 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nredundant  employee's wages may not be enough  for\r\n\r\nhim to live on. He may want more\r\n\r\n-  70  per cent, 90 per cent or even 100 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt  may  be  argued that 60 per cent  may  not  be\r\n\r\nenough.  But I think the worker who has  lost  his\r\n\r\njob  should  try his very best to live within  his\r\n\r\nmeans.  It is better that he should draw out  less\r\n\r\nso  that his money in the Fund can last longer. If\r\n\r\nhe  draws out more, his money will last him for  a\r\n\r\nvery  short time and after that the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment  will have to take over. That  will  be\r\n\r\nvery unwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also touched upon the possibility\r\n\r\nof  investing this Fund in commercial concerns and\r\n\r\nindustries  in the country, so that  it  can  draw\r\n\r\nhigher  returns  and may also be used  to  set  up\r\n\r\ncorporations so as to create jobs for the workers.\r\n\r\nI  think he has forgotten that the Fund is subject\r\n\r\nto  withdrawals, and it is very difficult  to  say\r\n\r\nfor  certain  how much money we will have  in  the\r\n\r\nFund  at  any  one time. So I think  Members  will\r\n\r\nagree  that for a fluctuating fund of this nature,\r\n\r\nit  is  rather difficult to invest it in any fixed\r\n\r\nventures.  Furthermore,  in  any  shares  in   any\r\n\r\nbusiness concerns, whilst there is the probability\r\n\r\nof large profits, there is also the probability of\r\n\r\ngreat  losses.  It is unwise to put  the  workers'\r\n\r\nmoney  in investments of a speculative nature.  It\r\n\r\nis  rather  early to say how the Director  of  the\r\n\r\nFund will invest the money in order to earn enough\r\n\r\nincome  to pay the 5\u00bc per cent interest guaranteed\r\n\r\nto the workers. But it is safe to say that he will\r\n\r\nonly invest this money\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nin Government bonds, Treasury Bills and other very\r\n\r\nsafe bonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah wants to know\r\n\r\nwhether  this Bill will cover executive  personnel\r\n\r\nin the commercial sector, because he does not want\r\n\r\nthem  to enjoy this exemption from income  tax.  I\r\n\r\ncan   assure  him  that  the  intention   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  to  offer this privilege  only  to\r\n\r\nworkers in the British military bases, and  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  any intention at the present moment  to\r\n\r\nextend it to other sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants to know what happens if a\r\n\r\nmember  of the Fund runs out of money to  pay  his\r\n\r\nrent to the Housing Board, or to pay his water and\r\n\r\nelectricity  bill  to the Public Utilities  Board.\r\n\r\nHow  is  the Housing Board or the Public Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard  going  to recover arrears? If such  a  case\r\n\r\narises, and if the member is a citizen, I think he\r\n\r\ncan apply under clause 10 of this Bill to withdraw\r\n\r\nhis money in order to pay these debts. If he is  a\r\n\r\nnon-citizen, when he leaves the country  there  is\r\n\r\nstill  one-third of his money left in the Fund.  I\r\n\r\npresume  this money will be sufficient to pay  for\r\n\r\nhis  passage as well as any arrears owing  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board and the Public Utilities Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson wants to know whether\r\n\r\ngratuities paid to Government employees would also\r\n\r\nenjoy this privilege of exemption from income tax.\r\n\r\nI say that this is not the case because we have no\r\n\r\nintention to extend this privilege to Government\r\n\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants to set up a board to\r\n\r\nconsider   withdrawals.  This  can  be   done   by\r\n\r\nadministrative  action. It  is  not  necessary  to\r\n\r\ninclude  this  provision in  the  Bill.  There  is\r\n\r\nalready provision that the Minister has the  power\r\n\r\nto  regulate  the  nature of the withdrawals.  The\r\n\r\nMember  also  wants 20 per cent of the  redundancy\r\n\r\npayment  to be withdrawn unconditionally  so  that\r\n\r\nthe worker can have a little enjoyment. He has not\r\n\r\nsaid  what this enjoyment is, but it may be a trip\r\n\r\nround  the world or something like that.  That  is\r\n\r\nexactly  why  this  Bill has been  introduced,  to\r\n\r\nguard against such injudicious spending.
