At that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime,  the  area  occupied by the Bank  was  about\r\n\r\n6,000  sq. ft.  To  cope  with  the  Bank's  much\r\n\r\nincreased business, it was necessary to expand the\r\n\r\nheadquarters  premises  to  alleviate  congestion.\r\n\r\nPlans  were  finalised and  funds  voted  for  the\r\n\r\nproject. At the end of 1970, the Bank was informed\r\n\r\nthat  the premises of the Registry of Vehicles  in\r\n\r\nMiddle  Road  were  earmarked for  re-development.\r\n\r\nAttempts   were  made  to  look  for   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation   for   the   Bank   but    suitable\r\n\r\nalternatives  could  not be found.  Since  it  was\r\n\r\nconsidered  that the Bank's continued use  of  the\r\n\r\npremises  at Middle Road would be consistent  with\r\n\r\nan urban renewal site, the Bank discussed with the\r\n\r\nLand  Office the question of the purchase  of  the\r\n\r\npresent building and site. In the discussions, the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Lands indicated that  the  Bank's\r\n\r\npurchase  of the site could only be considered  if\r\n\r\nthe  Bank  had  firm plans for the  building.  The\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Lands was advised  that  detailed\r\n\r\nplans  would be submitted in due course  and  that\r\n\r\nthe Bank was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the view the ROV complex at Middle Road  would\r\n\r\nbe  suitable for the permanent headquarters of the\r\n\r\nBank.  The Bank also stated it would be interested\r\n\r\nin  bidding for the whole ROV site when the latter\r\n\r\nwas put up for re-development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st January, 1972, the Bank became a statutory\r\n\r\ncorporation and, as the need for accommodation was\r\n\r\nvery  acute,  the  Bank decided  to  proceed  with\r\n\r\nrenovation  of  the  existing  premises,  and  the\r\n\r\nPublic Works Department was appointed to plan  and\r\n\r\nexecute  the  project. The Bank  has  assured  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  Lands that it  does  not  intend\r\n\r\nseeking   compensation   if   the   building    is\r\n\r\nsubsequently  demolished for  re-development.  The\r\n\r\nBank also reiterated its interest in making a  bid\r\n\r\nfor  the whole of the ROV site at Middle Road when\r\n\r\nthe   site   is  eventually  available   for   re-development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When completed, the renovation costing\r\n\r\napproximately $266,000 will provide a  total  area\r\n\r\nof  10,500  sq. ft. If the Bank had tried  in  the\r\n\r\nopen  market  to lease 10,500 sq. ft. of  office\r\n\r\nspace  it would have to pay at least $120,000  per\r\n\r\nannum  in rental. The ROV site at Middle  Road  is\r\n\r\nunlikely  to  be available for re-development  for\r\n\r\nanother  three years. On this basis, even  if  the\r\n\r\nBank's renovated building at Middle Road is pulled\r\n\r\ndown  for  re-development in  three  years'  time,\r\n\r\nthere would still be a saving of about $94,000  to\r\n\r\nthe  Bank  in  renovating these existing  premises\r\n\r\nrather  than  renting similar space  on  the  open\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Business Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek your consent,\r\n\r\nand the general assent of hon.

Govindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Sports Promotion Board, under\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Social Affairs,  has  the  great\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  promoting  sports.  In  recent\r\n\r\nyears, the NSPB has done a lot in this respect. We\r\n\r\nhave seen a lot of sports activities being carried\r\n\r\nout  because  of its efforts. For instance,  under\r\n\r\nthe  auspices of NSPB last year, we conducted  the\r\n\r\nfirst   soccer  competition  among   the   various\r\n\r\nconstituencies  and also a basketball  tournament.\r\n\r\nAll these had been very successfully organised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the NSPB still has much to do to further\r\n\r\nimprove  sports  activities.  Firstly,  since  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the NSPB is to promote and raise\r\n\r\nthe  standard of sports, it should go all out. For\r\n\r\ninstance, in badminton we were well known  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  But our standards have fallen \"10,000 feet\"\r\n\r\ndown, and are still on the decline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery  time  our  players took part  in  badminton\r\n\r\ncompetitions, they scored Nil. And for  basketball\r\n\r\nor  soccer matches too, the score was Nil;  if  it\r\n\r\nwas not a chicken's egg, then it was a duck's egg.\r\n\r\nSo  as  the  NSPB is the nerve centre  for  sports\r\n\r\npromotion  and  as  the Government  has  allocated\r\n\r\nlarge  sums of money for this purpose to make  our\r\n\r\nnext generation a rugged one, the NSPB should live\r\n\r\nup to its name by not letting the people down, but\r\n\r\ngive   them  confidence  and  hope  that  it  will\r\n\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what has\r\n\r\nthe  NSPB done or achieved since its inception  to\r\n\r\nraise the standard of sports. I regret to say that\r\n\r\nit  has  done nothing. It seems that the NSPB  has\r\n\r\nnot  paid  enough attention to promote sports  and\r\n\r\ngames   in  the  last  two  years.  It  has   only\r\n\r\nconcentrated its attention on soccer.  It  appears\r\n\r\nthat  the  NSPB  has neglected  to  promote  other\r\n\r\nsports  like badminton, basket-ball, volley  ball,\r\n\r\nfield and track events, judo, and others. If it is\r\n\r\nso, I hope the Minister can rectify the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 1973 is undoubtedly an important year in our\r\n\r\nsports history because the SEAP Games will be held\r\n\r\nin  Singapore in September this year. In  addition\r\n\r\nto playing our part as the host country, we should\r\n\r\nalso be able to ensure that our athletes put up  a\r\n\r\ngood   performance  in  order   to   qualify   for\r\n\r\nparticipation  in these Games. I  would  therefore\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask the Minister whether he has  started\r\n\r\nany intensive training courses for our athletes to\r\n\r\nraise their standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter I wish to mention is that not\r\n\r\nenough  publicity has been given to  these  Games.\r\n\r\nAnd  very  little  has been  done  in  respect  of\r\n\r\npromotion or readiness for the Games. I feel it is\r\n\r\nnot  enough to have just a few posters  pasted  at\r\n\r\nthe  back  of buses as advertisements. It  is  our\r\n\r\nglory  that  these  Games  will  be  held  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  So  the National Sports Promotion  Board\r\n\r\nshould  publicise early so as to enable our people\r\n\r\nto  be aware of this important event and the  NSPB\r\n\r\nshould  also put in more effort to get the  people\r\n\r\nto support the Games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to give some suggestions to the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  his  consideration.   Firstly,   a\r\n\r\nmagazine  should  be published  to  introduce  the\r\n\r\nsportsmen  of the various countries who come  here\r\n\r\nto  participate in the Games. Our local newspapers\r\n\r\ncan  also  do this. In this way, our athletes  and\r\n\r\nsportsmen  will be better prepared. Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nNSPB   should  prepare  in  advance  the   various\r\n\r\nsouvenirs,   gifts,  and  awards   depicting   our\r\n\r\nnational  characteristics so as  to  give  a  good\r\n\r\nimpression on the competitors from abroad. This is\r\n\r\nalso  one  way  to  promote tourism.  Thirdly,  we\r\n\r\nshould  publicise through Radio and TV the  sports\r\n\r\nevents.  In  this  way, we can inform  our  people\r\n\r\nbetter.  At  the same time we should  prepare  our\r\n\r\nathletes well so that they can win laurels for our\r\n\r\ncountry in the Games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nformation of the National Sports Promotion Board a\r\n\r\nfew years ago by the Ministry of Social Affairs is\r\n\r\ncommendable. As a result, I believe officials from\r\n\r\nthe  various  sports organisations have  organised\r\n\r\nthemselves  to promote sports in the Republic.  We\r\n\r\nshould  be proud that the SEAP games will be  held\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  very  soon. We have  provided  many\r\n\r\nfacilities  to  promote  sports  in  the   various\r\n\r\nfields. However, I am a little perturbed over  the\r\n\r\nstandard   of   our  sportsmen  in   international\r\n\r\ncompetitions. I wonder what the Ministry is  doing\r\n\r\nto  inject  new blood into the various  fields  of\r\n\r\nsports.  It  is no use spending so much  money  in\r\n\r\nproviding  facilities  when  the  people  are  not\r\n\r\ntaking   advantage  of  them.  Sportsmen  do   not\r\n\r\ndirectly  contribute  to the  Republic's  revenue.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, their achievement abroad is a morale\r\n\r\nbooster for our country. We have introduced family\r\n\r\nplanning  and  one of the reasons  is  to  achieve\r\n\r\nquality  in  our society. Therefore, sports  as  a\r\n\r\nsocial benefit should never be neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to inject new blood\r\n\r\ninto our sports organisations. In this way we  can\r\n\r\nbring  the standard of our sports to international\r\n\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery   encouragement  should  be  given  to   our\r\n\r\nsportsmen, otherwise it will be very hard for them\r\n\r\nto reach a high standard. This can be accomplished\r\n\r\nto  a  great extent by offering incentives to  our\r\n\r\nsportsmen,  such  as time-off and allowances.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  a  man  may  want  to  go  for  football\r\n\r\npractice, but he may not do so because he  has  to\r\n\r\nwork  the  whole day. The result is that he  would\r\n\r\nnot be able to play football well. He might not be\r\n\r\nable  even to kick the ball! They should  also  be\r\n\r\ngiven training in international events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps should also be taken to ensure that\r\n\r\ndiscipline  is  maintained  among  our  sportsmen.\r\n\r\nSometime  ago the National Sports Promotion  Board\r\n\r\ntook  action  to  suspend  some  prominent  soccer\r\n\r\nplayers  for  their bad conduct abroad.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  precautionary  measures  have  also  been\r\n\r\ntaken to prevent a recurrence of this nature among\r\n\r\nall other sportsmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inter-constituency tournament in soccer\r\n\r\nand basket-ball has to a certain extent provided a\r\n\r\nchange of scene for our sportsmen from the various\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  A  few  talented  sportsmen  were\r\n\r\nselected to represent the State. I wonder  whether\r\n\r\ncompetition  of this nature can be  organised  for\r\n\r\nthe other sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nsince  I  will be speaking on the National  Sports\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board under subhead 2027 of Head  1001,\r\n\r\nfor  which I have an amendment* , may I be  allowed to  speak now?

I\r\n\r\nwould like to add some of my own observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Sports Promotion Board was\r\n\r\nofficially formed on 1st February, 1971, with  the\r\n\r\nprimary objective of promoting all sports  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic.  Besides  encouraging,  developing   and\r\n\r\npromoting  sports for competition and recreational\r\n\r\npurposes,  the  Board is also supposed  to  foster\r\n\r\nresearch and studies in sports, physical education\r\n\r\nand  to  train instructors. However, I  regret  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that since its inception the Board has not\r\n\r\nachieved its prime objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many in the sporting fields have observed and\r\n\r\ncomplained that the NSPB has been obviously biased\r\n\r\ntowards  soccer. In this respect, I would like  to\r\n\r\nask the Minister for Social Affairs how much money\r\n\r\nthe NSPB has spent in promoting soccer as compared\r\n\r\nto the other sports. I was surprised to learn from\r\n\r\nmany  members of the sporting public that the NSPB\r\n\r\nis  often  referred  to  as the  \"National  Soccer\r\n\r\nPromotion Board.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this partial approach in favour of' the\r\n\r\nFootball Association of Singapore, the standard of\r\n\r\nsoccer  in our Republic has still some way to  go,\r\n\r\nas  told  to me by many a previous expert. Another\r\n\r\ninteresting  feature is that  a  scratch  team  is\r\n\r\noften  called the Singapore Selection team or  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Invitation team. It was  only  about  a\r\n\r\nfortnight ago that I read in the newspapers that a\r\n\r\nfew   players  from  the  paying  spectators  were\r\n\r\nrequested,  just  before  the  match   began,   to\r\n\r\nrepresent  Singapore in a soccer match  against  a\r\n\r\nforeign  team. I think the Republic's name  should\r\n\r\nbe treated with greater respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soccer team also appears to be the privileged\r\n\r\nnational  team  in regard to overseas  travelling.\r\n\r\nThe  team had made about eight trips abroad during\r\n\r\nthe past year, although the Association has little\r\n\r\nmoney. I was told that seven officials accompanied\r\n\r\nthe team of only 17 footballers to participate  in\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKing's Cup tournament at Thailand. Of these  seven\r\n\r\nofficials, five were paid for by the NSPB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard also from the Sports Parade programme\r\n\r\nlast  Friday  that the National Soccer  Team  will\r\n\r\nmake  an  extensive tour of Australia sometime  in\r\n\r\nOctober/November this year after the  SEAP  Games.\r\n\r\nThis  is  arranged as an incentive  or  reward  to\r\n\r\nperform   well  in  the  coming  Games.  I   would\r\n\r\ntherefore suggest that NSPB should look  into  the\r\n\r\nprobability  of arranging such trips or  \"rewards\"\r\n\r\nfor  other games, which 1 am sure may perform much\r\n\r\nbetter  than  the soccer team in the  coming  SEAP\r\n\r\nGames!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, some officials of the NSPB\r\n\r\nhave seized every opportunity to travel abroad for\r\n\r\nno apparent good reason. Selection of officials to\r\n\r\nlead  and  travel with certain national  teams  is\r\n\r\nseldom  based  on  merit and  necessity.  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore suggest that available public funds must\r\n\r\nbe spent wisely and fairly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me now, Sir, to shift the scene back to\r\n\r\nSports  House - the headquarters of the NSPB.  The\r\n\r\nMedical  Unit, I understand, consists of  a  well-equipped  Sports Medical Department as well  as  a\r\n\r\nPhysiotherapy sub-unit. I would also like to  know\r\n\r\nhow  much money was spent to set up this Unit? How\r\n\r\nmany cases were treated for 1972, and whether  any\r\n\r\nresearch papers were produced to help our  various\r\n\r\ncoaches  and  athletes? I was also told  that  the\r\n\r\nmedical  officer spends much more time  trying  to\r\n\r\npromote sports than conducting research in  sports\r\n\r\nmedicine.  In  addition, the  physiotherapist  has\r\n\r\nresigned due to the lack of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I would like\r\n\r\nto  raise concerns the indiscriminate promotion of\r\n\r\ninter-constituency   games,   which    was    also\r\n\r\npreviously  mentioned by the other Members.  While\r\n\r\nthe  good  objective of such promotion is welcomed\r\n\r\nby  all,  proper and efficient planning should  be\r\n\r\nexercised.  The  NSPB should not get  involved  in\r\n\r\norganising age-group games. This group of students\r\n\r\nis well catered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor   by  the  schools  themselves.  Hence,   this\r\n\r\nexercise  by NSPB is a duplication of  effort  and\r\n\r\ntaxes the young students to maximum capacity.  Our\r\n\r\nnational need is to look after the school  leavers\r\n\r\nand  to  provide  healthy sporting activities  for\r\n\r\ntheir  well-being. The Board can  therefore  spend\r\n\r\nits  time  more  profitably if it seriously  looks\r\n\r\ninto this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above few observations, Sir, it appears\r\n\r\nthat  the  administration of the  NSPB  is  indeed\r\n\r\nlacking in efficiency. There is completely no  co-ordination and rapport among the various  sections\r\n\r\nand there appears to be also a lack of experienced\r\n\r\nofficials.  I  would therefore  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nwhole  administration of the  NSPB  he  thoroughly\r\n\r\nreorganised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to note that the Board has\r\n\r\nreceived  much financial aid from the  commercial\r\n\r\nsector, and that for 1971 alone the Board received\r\n\r\na grant of $400,000 from Singapore Pools (Private)\r\n\r\nLtd.  These  contributions and grants  from  well-wishers are meant to promote sports in general and\r\n\r\nnot  to  be so biasly confined to certain  sports.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the Finance Committee of the NSPB  should\r\n\r\nspend  more  time  looking into a  fairer  way  of\r\n\r\napportioning funds, and should meet more regularly\r\n\r\nto effect better control of expenditure and funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  made by the National Sports  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard   to   organise  inter-constituency   soccer\r\n\r\ntournament with the object of promoting sports and\r\n\r\nscouting talent in sports is a good one. This will\r\n\r\nincrease  the  standard of  soccer  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhich  seems to be on the decline. But,  Sir,  you\r\n\r\nwill  be disheartened to learn that at this moment\r\n\r\nonly 16 constituencies have organised sports clubs\r\n\r\nwhich  have since been registered. Nine clubs  are\r\n\r\nunder consideration for registration, but the rest\r\n\r\nhave   not   submitted  their   applications   for\r\n\r\nregistration. Although the effort of the NSPB is a\r\n\r\ngood  one, nevertheless more than 50 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe constituencies have not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyet  made  any  applications for  registration.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve   there  must  be  some  reason  why   the\r\n\r\nconstituencies have not responded to the call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NSPB has so far only made suggestions, but it\r\n\r\nhas  made  no  real contribution  whatsoever.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  some  constituencies  like  Kampung\r\n\r\nKembangan,  there  are  no  facilities   for   the\r\n\r\ntraining  of  badminton,  especially  those   with\r\n\r\ntalent. The open badminton courts in the community\r\n\r\ncentres  are not suitable for players with talent.\r\n\r\nThese  players need to be trained in indoor courts\r\n\r\nbecause  badminton competitions, whether  national\r\n\r\nor international, are played in indoor courts. But\r\n\r\nI  think  the  NSPB  can at least  make  a  useful\r\n\r\ncontribution  by  organising  group  training   in\r\n\r\nbadminton, and also other sports like soccer,  for\r\n\r\nplayers  who  show promise. Although the  NSPB  is\r\n\r\nbiased   towards  soccer,  nevertheless,   in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency there is not a single football  field\r\n\r\nin  which to play soccer. The public is prohibited\r\n\r\nfrom  using  the  school playing  fields  for  any\r\n\r\nsports  activities. Therefore,  I  hope  the  NSPB\r\n\r\nwill,  in addition to organising sports at  inter-constituency  level, also provide  facilities  for\r\n\r\nthe  training  of talented youths.  For  instance,\r\n\r\nthere  should  be facilities for the  training  of\r\n\r\nsoccer, swimming, badminton, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  1  join the chorus of four Members  who  have\r\n\r\nspoken  about  the somewhat sad state  of  affairs\r\n\r\nthat  exists  in  the  sports world  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday.  I remember having risen here and said  the\r\n\r\nsame thing some six months ago, and to this day  I\r\n\r\nam  sad  to  say  that there has been  no  visible\r\n\r\nimprovement in any particular game in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, six months ago, I called for the formation\r\n\r\nof  a  Sports  Ministry and I have  not  forgotten\r\n\r\nabout  this  call. If the NSPB, as we  have  heard\r\n\r\nearlier   on,  cannot  properly  carry   out   its\r\n\r\nfunctions and responsibility expected of it,  then\r\n\r\nscrap  it. Let us not continue to allow vast  sums\r\n\r\nof money to go down the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"soccer drain\". Soccer has risen to no heights. We\r\n\r\nhope  it  will rise. But despite all  the  efforts\r\n\r\nthat have been put in, I think it still stays on a\r\n\r\npretty low plane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to be fair in my comment. Over\r\n\r\nthe  last year or so the Government has, in  fact,\r\n\r\ntried  to  promote sports in the  form  of  inter-constituency games, and it has definitely  aroused\r\n\r\nmore  interest and more participation from various\r\n\r\npeople   -sportsmen  and  athletes  -   throughout\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But I think we have to  do  much  more\r\n\r\nthan  what  we have done. I would like  to  repeat\r\n\r\nwhat has been said earlier by certain Members that\r\n\r\nthe  emphasis by the NSPB has been and still is  -\r\n\r\nwe hope never - lopsided. This lopsidedness is too\r\n\r\napparent  and  is  not  in  the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\nsporting  world  in  Singapore.  Soccer  has  been\r\n\r\npromoted  too much without any reasonable  result.\r\n\r\nWhat about the other sports organisations? We have\r\n\r\nyet  to  hear of the volley ball association,  for\r\n\r\nexample,   sending   its  team   for   competition\r\n\r\nelsewhere. We have yet to hear of the NSPB  trying\r\n\r\nto  promote the other sporting activities. Members\r\n\r\nmay   be   aware   that  at  the   recent   karate\r\n\r\ncompetition, one member of the Singapore team  did\r\n\r\nvery  well,  and nobody has suggested sending  our\r\n\r\nkarate team for further training in Japan. I think\r\n\r\nwe  should  promote  our  national  teams.  Boxing\r\n\r\nrequires  to  be further promoted.  Table  tennis,\r\n\r\nbadminton,  even  swimming and  water  polo,  need\r\n\r\nfurther promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In swimming, our boys and girls have been sent\r\n\r\noverseas  through the main efforts  of  their  own\r\n\r\nparents.  I  say  swimming has done  far  more  to\r\n\r\nuplift the standard of Singapore sports than  many\r\n\r\nother games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

But  let  me  come  to\r\n\r\nspecifics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to the Minister concerned\r\n\r\nthat perhaps we should, at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleast  for a start, consider two matters and grant\r\n\r\nspecial  consideration for our sportsmen. Firstly,\r\n\r\nwe should give time-off to our sportsmen for their\r\n\r\ntraining.  Let us facilitate them.  Some  of  them\r\n\r\nmight be working in Jurong, and they have to  come\r\n\r\ndown for training at Fairer Park. They finish work\r\n\r\nat  5  p.m. and they are expected to be at  Fairer\r\n\r\nPark  at  5 p.m. I say, this is a bit too much.  I\r\n\r\ncan quote cases where they just cannot make it. In\r\n\r\nthe  end,  they  would probably drop  out  of  the\r\n\r\nnational team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I am sure the various sports\r\n\r\nassociations  would appreciate it if the  Minister\r\n\r\ncan arrange with the Singapore Airlines, just like\r\n\r\nthe  arrangement by the Ministry of Education  for\r\n\r\nspecial concession rates, to send our athletes  or\r\n\r\nsportsmen   overseas  at  concession  rates.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education has arranged group tours  at\r\n\r\nhalf-price. Why not do the same for our sportsmen?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  speak  as  I am provoked by the  very  sincere\r\n\r\nthough very vigorous arguments put forward by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Kim Seng. From the impromptu utterances\r\n\r\nin  this  House, one can actually sample the  true\r\n\r\nfeelings of the Members here. The Member  for  Kim\r\n\r\nSeng  has  put  up  a  pretty  balanced  argument,\r\n\r\nalthough  the  Member for River Valley's  argument\r\n\r\nmight  appear  to  be  lopsided.  Probably  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  he was an exponent in water polo  in  his\r\n\r\nyounger days. I hope he still is. But I would take\r\n\r\nhis  argument  very  seriously,  Sir,  because   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the Member for River Valley, as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Kim  Seng, know  what  they  are\r\n\r\ntalking about because they were sportsmen before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we in Singapore are faced with a\r\n\r\nrather  difficult situation in that our population\r\n\r\nis not sufficiently sports conscious in as much as\r\n\r\nthey  are not sufficiently culture conscious  from\r\n\r\nthe arguments we heard yesterday. A solution might\r\n\r\nwell appear to be to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbroaden  the sports base. The best approach  would\r\n\r\nbe  to train our young students in the schools. It\r\n\r\nis  indeed a very heartening sight nowadays, if we\r\n\r\ndrive around or near the locations of the schools,\r\n\r\nto see young students sweating themselves, running\r\n\r\nalong  the  road and unfortunately,  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, breathing in rather polluted air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to face the fact that our population\r\n\r\nhere  is  of  migrant stock. We carry  with  us  a\r\n\r\nrather  different thinking on matters like sports.\r\n\r\nSir,  I remember that when I was a young lad,  any\r\n\r\nextra-mural activities on my part, like trying  to\r\n\r\nkick  a football in a back-lane, would always  end\r\n\r\nup  with  a few strokes of the rotan at  the  most\r\n\r\ntender part of my body. That was unfortunately the\r\n\r\nopinion or idea of our older generation on sports.\r\n\r\nOur  forefathers rather preferred us to spend more\r\n\r\ntime  digging  into  our books  than  going  round\r\n\r\nkicking a ball, unfortunately, at the wrong  place\r\n\r\ntoo  -  in  a backlane. The situation has  changed\r\n\r\nnow. We cannot afford to have a population digging\r\n\r\ninto  books  with  total  disregard  for  physical\r\n\r\nfitness,   particularly  in  a  highly   urbanised\r\n\r\nsociety as in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the advantage of seeing a few highly\r\n\r\nindustrialised cities in this part of the world. I\r\n\r\nfind  that  the  population  there  has  a  rather\r\n\r\nsignificant peculiarity in that they are small  in\r\n\r\nbuild,  fair, and rather timid in nature. I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  due to the fact that the country  is  so\r\n\r\nhighly urbanised that the people have got to  live\r\n\r\nin  small houses. There is no chance for  them  to\r\n\r\nstretch their muscles. The working rhythm and lack\r\n\r\nof nourishment are contributing factors. And, most\r\n\r\nimportant, they are not sports conscious. In  that\r\n\r\nsituation, I am afraid it is almost impossible  to\r\n\r\nproduce  good  sportsmen because  of  insufficient\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  the promotion of sports.  In  the\r\n\r\nend, they produce a young generation who are small\r\n\r\nbuilt.  Sir, I mention this not with the intention\r\n\r\nof  throwing any reflection on any Member in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  I  say that we have to accept what  nature\r\n\r\nhas  given us. But I think we can improve  on  our\r\n\r\nphysical make-up by better nourishment,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfacilities for sports and exercise.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot  need  to  develop  ourselves  into  a  highly\r\n\r\nurbanised  and  civilized society  but  with  soft\r\n\r\nknees  and  soft elbows. We may have good  brains,\r\n\r\nbut  I  think  we  also need the muscles  and  the\r\n\r\nstamina to make our brains work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Members have put forward very\r\n\r\npositive arguments. In my younger days, I was only\r\n\r\na  second  grade  sportsman; I never  reached  the\r\n\r\nfirst  team in the school. Probably I did  not  do\r\n\r\nenough.  I do not wish to put the entire blame  on\r\n\r\nmy  generation.  But I feel that the  Members  who\r\n\r\nhave  spoken - I hope all Members in this House  -\r\n\r\ncan  be equally positive, physically, in promoting\r\n\r\nsports  as they are vocal on that subject in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  I was rather impressed by the argument  of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Sembawang. This is a rare occasion,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  I agree with him. I believe that  when\r\n\r\ncredit  is  due, it must be readily given.  I  was\r\n\r\nquite impressed by the rather balanced argument in\r\n\r\nthe  first  part  of his speech, but  disappointed\r\n\r\ntowards the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Member for Sembawang stood up, I\r\n\r\nrecall  that  he had also on a few  occasions  got\r\n\r\nhimself  involved or perhaps someone else involved\r\n\r\nhim  in  some  kind of sports  -  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhichever  way  it was. He was the leader  of  the\r\n\r\ntable  tennis team that toured Seoul, South Korea.\r\n\r\nAm  I correct? Sir, before I go on I would like to\r\n\r\nseek  clarification. If it is  not  true,  then  I\r\n\r\nwould  divert  the  subject.

I believe it is of no use if some  Members\r\n\r\nof  Parliament headed some sports associations.  I\r\n\r\nknow  one  Member, Sir, who is involved  with  the\r\n\r\nBoxing  Association and this Association is  doing\r\n\r\nwell.  They produce good boxers. But I cannot  see\r\n\r\nthe  logic that a certain Member of Parliament led\r\n\r\nteams of, say, table tennis and swimming overseas,\r\n\r\nwhen he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhimself did not in the first place contribute much\r\n\r\nto  deserve those trips. Secondly, what  were  the\r\n\r\nexperiences of these two trips?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the results of the matches, whether we\r\n\r\nbrought home duck's eggs or chicken's eggs as  one\r\n\r\nMember referred to, I think is immaterial. The two\r\n\r\ntrips  should  be  sufficient  enough  to  provoke\r\n\r\nanyone, including The Member in this House, to get\r\n\r\nhimself   involved  in  these  two   sports   more\r\n\r\nseriously. What I intend to put forward is that it\r\n\r\nhas  become rather ridiculous and a mockery to the\r\n\r\nsport  itself  a Member leading a sports  team  or\r\n\r\naccompanying the team overseas, while  he  himself\r\n\r\nknows  nothing about the sport. I used to  involve\r\n\r\nmyself in these two particular sports before,  but\r\n\r\nI  felt  I could not positively contribute towards\r\n\r\nthe  sports and I declined a proposal made  to  me\r\n\r\nseveral  years  ago,  to  head  a  certain  sports\r\n\r\nassociation. I did not believe at that  time  that\r\n\r\nmy  involvement  in  that particular  association,\r\n\r\neither  as  an  official or just to  lead  a  team\r\n\r\noverseas, would do much good to that sport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should view this with a more balanced and\r\n\r\nlogical mind. Instead of merely catching on a trip\r\n\r\n-  I  think  the  Members for Kim Seng  and  River\r\n\r\nValley  said  that trips were paid  for,  or  that\r\n\r\nthere  would be reward trips and so on, I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  is  a good thing. Sir,  because  this\r\n\r\nvacant  seat in the aeroplane could well be  given\r\n\r\nto  a young sportsman who could be trained, rather\r\n\r\nthan sending someone who had never even touched  a\r\n\r\nracket  or  a  bat, or even went  as  far  as  the\r\n\r\nwater's  edge.  I  do not know  how  we  can  make\r\n\r\nourselves answerable to the sports public that one\r\n\r\nwho  has  never involved himself in the sport  and\r\n\r\nknew  nothing about it could get himself  involved\r\n\r\nin heading an overseas trip for that sport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to listen to some arguments\r\n\r\nafterwards  so that when I leave this  Chamber  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of this debate, I can walk away with some\r\n\r\nfresh ideas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  to  how  sports  can be promoted,  other  than\r\n\r\ngetting   a   few   well-known  personalities   to\r\n\r\naccompany the sports team, because that is  surely\r\n\r\nnot the way to improve sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary is talking something which\r\n\r\nis  quite  irrelevant to what  we  are  discussing\r\n\r\nhere.

He is trying to  show\r\n\r\nhis   capability  that  he  was  a  second   grade\r\n\r\nsportsman in his school days. He is trying to show\r\n\r\noff  his ability. I wonder what he has in mind.

Secondly, had I been out of order, I believe\r\n\r\nyou  would have put me in my proper place earlier.\r\n\r\nSo I do not think there is the need for the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang  to take over the functions  of  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  all have heard what you have  ruled.  So\r\n\r\nwhat else is there to say?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely wish\r\n\r\nto  clarify  the  stand of those  few  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  who  spoke  earlier.  They  were  only\r\n\r\ntrying  to constructively criticise the  NSPB.  We\r\n\r\nwould like to assure the Member for Stamford  that\r\n\r\neach   of  us  in  our  own  field  could   easily\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  the particular sporting  organisation\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  attached to as  to  how  to  run  a\r\n\r\nparticular  sports association. I, for one,  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure  him  that, as  far  as  positive\r\n\r\ncontribution is concerned, I can suggest many ways\r\n\r\nof  running a particular game or a few  sports.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  has  been misunderstood. The  intention\r\n\r\nhere is to show cause as to why the NSPB should be\r\n\r\nreorganised and in what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nareas. I have only given, in my particular case, a\r\n\r\nfew  examples showing why it is not completely  in\r\n\r\norder.  Therefore, I am obviously putting  forward\r\n\r\ncriticisms  which I hope are constructive.  It  is\r\n\r\nunderstood that whatever little good that you have\r\n\r\ndone,  the public will appreciate. So let  me,  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  those who merely take the  stand,  say\r\n\r\nhere that we are trying to tell what is wrong with\r\n\r\nNSPB.   As  to  positive  contributions,   certain\r\n\r\nMembers are associated with certain sports, and so\r\n\r\non,  and  I  think  they will work  on  their  own\r\n\r\nparticular area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something basically wrong with NSPB in\r\n\r\nits  major role to promote all forms of sports.  I\r\n\r\nthink  what we have all tried to say was  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  biased. It was also unnecessarily lacking  in\r\n\r\nefficiency in certain areas as pointed out by some\r\n\r\nof  us.  I think it was not meant to be a balanced\r\n\r\nstatement. It is obviously an unbalanced statement\r\n\r\nto pin-point the areas which need improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, we are very fortunate to be able to  host\r\n\r\nthe  SEAP Games in our country for the first time.\r\n\r\nWhen  preparing  for such an important  event,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  very  careful in  dealing  with  the\r\n\r\nvarious   problems.  The  Government   itself   is\r\n\r\nactively engaged in planning the Games. This is  a\r\n\r\ngood  indication.  But  I have  some  doubts  here\r\n\r\nwhich,   although  might  have  been  brought   up\r\n\r\nalready, still give rise to some confusion.  So  I\r\n\r\nwould like to bring them up for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that in planning for the SEAP Games, the\r\n\r\nNational  Sports Promotion Board and the Singapore\r\n\r\nNational   Olympic  Council  seem  to  have   some\r\n\r\nconfusion    over   each   other's   duties    and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. As we understand it, the NSPB is\r\n\r\nthe  official body for the promotion of sports and\r\n\r\nis  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of Government, for example, in respect  of\r\n\r\nfinancing sports, provision of facilities for  the\r\n\r\nvarious games, and in the welfare of sportsmen and\r\n\r\nbudgetting. All these are the responsibilities  of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNSPB.  I  think it should not directly control  or\r\n\r\nintervene in the activities of the various  sports\r\n\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SNOC, however, consists of members from\r\n\r\nvarious   sports  associations.  Each  member   is\r\n\r\nresponsible for the membership of his  own  sports\r\n\r\nassociation.  That is why they should  play  their\r\n\r\npart in the Council. Members of the SNOC should be\r\n\r\nasked  by the NSPB to do something positive.  They\r\n\r\nshould  not  play a passive role. They should  act\r\n\r\nunder  instructions. From what  we  can  see,  the\r\n\r\nvarious  sports  associations have been  receiving\r\n\r\ncertain  questions and queries from the NSPB.  But\r\n\r\nthey did not know whom to refer to. And when there\r\n\r\nis a real problem to be solved, and they are given\r\n\r\nspecific  instructions and orders, all they  could\r\n\r\ndo is to pass the buck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Organising Committee of\r\n\r\nthe   Games,   there  is  a  so-called   Executive\r\n\r\nSecretary and also a Secretary-General.  What  are\r\n\r\nthe  duties  and  responsibilities  of  these  two\r\n\r\nposts?  How do you differentiate the two posts?  I\r\n\r\nhope   the  Minister  concerned  can  give  us   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for\r\n\r\ngiving me a chance to speak at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me tackle the Member for Sembawang. I\r\n\r\nuse  the word \"tackle\" in the context of sport.  I\r\n\r\nwill answer the Member in two parts, first on  the\r\n\r\nNSPB, and then on the SEAP Games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the establishment of the National Sports\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board  two  years  ago,  it  has   been\r\n\r\nactively engaged in promoting sports at all levels\r\n\r\nand  in  supporting  the various  national  sports\r\n\r\norganisations in realising new ideas  and  efforts\r\n\r\nin  this  field of expanding endeavour. The  Board\r\n\r\nhas already taken root and started promisingly  in\r\n\r\nevolving  a  national sports programme  through  a\r\n\r\nnetwork  of  sports  councils,  associations   and\r\n\r\nclubs,   as   well   as  sports  secretaries   and\r\n\r\nconvenors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last two years much has already been\r\n\r\ndone  to promote competitive international sports.\r\n\r\nBut it must be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecognised that it takes time and effort to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  standard of performance of our sportsmen  and\r\n\r\nteams  to  the  level required to win  honours  in\r\n\r\ninternational  competitions. The Board  could,  in\r\n\r\nfact, create an impact in terms of performance  by\r\n\r\nputting  all  the  means of the  Republic  at  the\r\n\r\ndisposal  of a relatively small number of champion\r\n\r\nathletes  and to attempt to achieve victories  and\r\n\r\nmedals  by  their  prowess. Such  an  approach,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  will bring immediate results. But  in  the\r\n\r\nlong  run  it  will  not help to  raise  standards\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  lack of a broad base  of  sports\r\n\r\ntalent,   which  can  only  be  developed  through\r\n\r\nsystematic work and intense and dedicated training\r\n\r\non  the  part  of a large number of sportsmen  and\r\n\r\nteams.  It  is indeed gratifying that  this  broad\r\n\r\nframework  of participation in sports has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  established and no doubt, Sir, we  will  see\r\n\r\nbetter performance in sports in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although the problem of developing\r\n\r\nstandards of excellence is an important one, it is\r\n\r\nby   no   means  the  major  objective  in  sports\r\n\r\npromotion.   Our   primary   objective   in    the\r\n\r\norganisation  of  sports is not  just  to  produce\r\n\r\nchampions, but also to raise the general  physical\r\n\r\nfitness of the population. The approach then is to\r\n\r\nencourage more people, particularly our youths, to\r\n\r\ntake   up   sports  seriously  as  it   leads   to\r\n\r\nimprovement  of  the individual's body  and  mind,\r\n\r\ncharacter  and  capacity, which is  important  for\r\n\r\nsocial peace and happiness, and for individual and\r\n\r\nnational productivity and progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for inter-constituency sports, Sir, which has\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced  recently by the  Board,  it  has\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  very  clearly  the  principle   that\r\n\r\nsports   activities,   properly   conceived    and\r\n\r\norganised,  can  he  promoted effectively  at  the\r\n\r\nconstituency  level. This represents  a  breakaway\r\n\r\nfrom  the  traditional concept of sports promotion\r\n\r\nwhose  major  effort  seems to  be  restricted  to\r\n\r\ninstitutions like clubs and various community\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagencies.  In  the past  year,  the  NSPB,\r\n\r\nalthough  working  under  considerable  strain  of\r\n\r\nmanpower and finance, has successfully implemented\r\n\r\nthe  following:  the  inter-constituency  football\r\n\r\ntournament, which most of us here know; the inter-constituency    basket-ball    tournament;    and,\r\n\r\nincidentally, the Grand Prix, which is being  held\r\n\r\nevery  year  with popular support; and the  sports\r\n\r\nfestival,  Pesta Sukan. I think there is  no  need\r\n\r\nfor me to elaborate because most of the Members of\r\n\r\nParliament  were  present at the  Grand  Prix  and\r\n\r\nother sports activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another thing which I would like to touch\r\n\r\nupon is the sports facilities. We are conscious of\r\n\r\nthe  shortage of facilities in Singapore,  and  we\r\n\r\nwill  therefore provide better facilities for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  by improving  most  of  our\r\n\r\nfootball  fields, tennis courts,  swimming  pools,\r\n\r\nsquash courts, football stadiums, athletic centres\r\n\r\nand  so  on. At the present moment, we believe  we\r\n\r\nhave  the  best  maintained lot of facilities  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Altogether, Sir,  we  have  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  24 football fields, eight swimming  pools,\r\n\r\n36 tennis courts, five squash courts, two athletic\r\n\r\ncentres,  besides the Jalan Besar and the  Kallang\r\n\r\nfootball    stadia   which   are   available    to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans at very low rentals. Perhaps  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  most difficult tasks devolved upon the  Board\r\n\r\nis  the taking over of sports facilities from  the\r\n\r\nformer British bases. These facilities had  to  he\r\n\r\nrenovated   and   improved  upon,   and   a   huge\r\n\r\nadministrative  machinery had  to  be  established\r\n\r\nvery quickly to make the facilities available  for\r\n\r\npublic  use  and to run them. The Board  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  given  the responsibility of  maintaining  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number  of sports facilities run  by  other\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments. All  these  put  a  heavy\r\n\r\nstrain  on  the Board which has to maintain  these\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  run them on a  non-profit  making\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have also produced a sports magazine.\r\n\r\nThis  was  launched  in October  1972.  With  this\r\n\r\nproduction,  we  have provided  one  more  healthy\r\n\r\nmagazine  for our youths and sports lovers.  Since\r\n\r\nits inception, the magazine has promoted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsports consciousness, especially among our youths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other activities of the NSPB are to assist in\r\n\r\nall  major international sports organised  by  the\r\n\r\nrespective   associations   in   Singapore.    The\r\n\r\nCommercial  Department sought  many  sponsorships,\r\n\r\nbig  and  small, from the private sector  for  the\r\n\r\nrespective associations. This included  a  sum  of\r\n\r\n$38,000  for the Badminton Association to  prepare\r\n\r\nthem  for  the Thomas Cup tournament. The Research\r\n\r\nDepartment assisted in conducting three  intensive\r\n\r\ncourses   in  athletics,  hockey  and  tennis.   A\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  gymnasium  for  weight  and   power\r\n\r\ntraining was also provided for the first time  for\r\n\r\nSingapore sportsmen. At the present moment,  under\r\n\r\nthe   auspices   of  the  Training  and   Research\r\n\r\nDepartment, approximately 250 sportsmen  each  day\r\n\r\ngo   through   the   mill.  The  Sports   Medicine\r\n\r\nDepartment   treated  more   than   600   national\r\n\r\nsportsmen,  providing them with  more  than  4,500\r\n\r\ntreatments  during the year. The  Department  also\r\n\r\nprovided  medical  coverage for all  international\r\n\r\ngames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding expansion, Sir, one of the priorities\r\n\r\nof  the  NSPB  is  to  promote  \"Sports  for  All\"\r\n\r\nprogrammes in Singapore. It is our belief that  in\r\n\r\norder  to  prevent social ills and to improve  the\r\n\r\nhealth  of our people, sports has a large part  to\r\n\r\nplay.   Moreover,  each  and  every   Singaporean,\r\n\r\nincluding  the Member for Sembawang,  should  have\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to take part in whatever physical\r\n\r\nactivities  he  may choose. The ingredients  of  a\r\n\r\n\"Sports   for   All\"  programme  are   three-fold.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  adequate facilities.  I  mentioned  this\r\n\r\njust  now,  Sir,  and  it is our  contention  that\r\n\r\nSingapore, as I have said, has far too few  public\r\n\r\namenities   for  sports  recreation.   So   urgent\r\n\r\nattention   will  be  paid  to  the  priority   of\r\n\r\nestablishing   more  facilities   throughout   the\r\n\r\nRepublic.  Secondly,  improved  organisation   and\r\n\r\npromotion. The NSPB is at the moment looking  into\r\n\r\nhow  we  can encompass all sports activities  from\r\n\r\nprimary to tertiary levels into one national breed\r\n\r\nso  that  there  will  be planned  activities  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans from cradle to grave. Thirdly, sports\r\n\r\nconsciousness. This has not been given very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmuch  attention in the past. It is  our  intention\r\n\r\nthat  people  should be educated into  the  belief\r\n\r\nthat  sports and recreation is good for them, good\r\n\r\nfor  their  families, good for the  community  and\r\n\r\ngood for the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans are afoot to further promote the ideal\r\n\r\nthrough  the  public media as well as through  top\r\n\r\nlevel  promotion of international sports. We  also\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  Board will be able  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture  to  introduce  a  scheme  of  fitness  and\r\n\r\nperformance test which can be promoted  throughout\r\n\r\nthe  Republic. It has also taken steps  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  training in all sports is carried out  on  a\r\n\r\nprofessional and scientific basis, and it is hoped\r\n\r\nthat  more  professional  personnel  can  be  made\r\n\r\navailable  to  ensure the success of  the  various\r\n\r\ntraining programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the SEAP Games. After the\r\n\r\nSixth SEAP Games which was held in Kuala Lumpur in\r\n\r\nDecember  1971,  the  Singapore  National  Olympic\r\n\r\nCouncil, in consultation with the National  Sports\r\n\r\nPromotion    Board,   appointed   the   Organising\r\n\r\nCommittee of the Seventh SEAP Games which is to be\r\n\r\nheld  in  Singapore this year. This  Committee  is\r\n\r\nresponsible  to the SEAP Games Federation  Council\r\n\r\nwhose  President is my colleague, Mr E. W. Barker.\r\n\r\nLike  the  Olympic  Council, it is  an  autonomous\r\n\r\norganisation.  It does not conic under  Government\r\n\r\nor  commercial control, but enjoys assistance from\r\n\r\nboth.  On 19th May, 1972, the Organising Committee\r\n\r\nmet for the first time and since then, the 12 Sub-Committees     looking    after     accommodation,\r\n\r\nceremonies,   decorations,   souvenirs,   finance,\r\n\r\nmedical  facilities, press and  public  relations,\r\n\r\nprogrammes,   technical   facilities,    protocol,\r\n\r\nreception  and  liaison,  security  and   traffic,\r\n\r\nsocial  and  catering,  and  transport,  have  had\r\n\r\nseveral   meetings  and  they   have   made   very\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  progress in staging the  Games  from\r\n\r\nthe  1st  to the 8th September. Arrangements  have\r\n\r\nbeen    made   to   house   approximately    1,500\r\n\r\nparticipants from the seven SEAP countries, namely\r\n\r\nBurma, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam\r\n\r\nand Singapore, in four 4-point blocks in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGames  Village,  which will be at Toa  Payoh.  The\r\n\r\nflats  are expected to be ready in July this year,\r\n\r\nand  the Singapore teams may make use of them from\r\n\r\nthe  1st  of August for their centralised training\r\n\r\nor  final phase of training in preparation for the\r\n\r\nGames.  Foreign teams are expected  at  the  Games\r\n\r\nVillage  on  30th  August. The  SEAP  Secretariat,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  now housed in Sports House,  will  also\r\n\r\nmove  to the Games Village in August. Besides  the\r\n\r\nshopping  complex,  which already  exists  in  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh, there will also be postal, telegraphic  and\r\n\r\nbanking facilities in the Games Village.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to inform the House that the\r\n\r\nPresident  of  the  Republic  of  Singapore   will\r\n\r\nofficiate at the opening and closing ceremonies of\r\n\r\nthe Seventh SEAP Games. An elaborate and colourful\r\n\r\nprogramme   is   being  planned  for   these   two\r\n\r\nceremonies  where school children will  give  mass\r\n\r\ndance  and band displays. The bands from the Armed\r\n\r\nForces, Police, and People's Association will also\r\n\r\nbe  in  attendance. 5,000 members of our Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  will  also put on a \"flash  card\"  display.\r\n\r\nThere  will  also  be the flame lighting  ceremony\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be held at Mount Faber and  the  SEAP\r\n\r\nTorch will be carried by our outstanding sportsmen\r\n\r\nto the National Stadium for the opening ceremony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants from the seven SEAP countries will\r\n\r\nparticipate  in 16 sports disciplines.  Athletics,\r\n\r\nfootball  and  lawn tennis will  be  held  at  the\r\n\r\nNational  Stadium;  badminton,  boxing  and  sepak\r\n\r\ntakraw  at  the Singapore Badminton Hall;  basket-ball at Gay World; cycling at Farrer Park Athletic\r\n\r\nCentre;  hockey  at Jalan Besar Stadium;  judo  at\r\n\r\nChung  Cheng High School; shooting at Mount Vernon\r\n\r\nand  Rifle Range Road Ranges; swimming, water polo\r\n\r\nand  diving  at  the new Toa Payoh swimming  pool,\r\n\r\nwhich  will be ready by July; table tennis at  the\r\n\r\nNational Junior College; volley ball at Chung  Hwa\r\n\r\nGirls' High School; weight-lifting at the People's\r\n\r\nTheatre; and yachting in Katong, off Nallur Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of the National Stadium is\r\n\r\nexpected to be ready by June, and all other venues\r\n\r\nwill be brought up to international standards  for\r\n\r\nthe  hosting of the Games. Arrangements will  also\r\n\r\nhe  made  to provide first-aid facilities  at  all\r\n\r\nGames venues. A medical centre will also be set up\r\n\r\nat  the  Games Village, and we will also  purchase\r\n\r\nequipment  to  perform dope  and  sex  tests.  All\r\n\r\nparticipants  and officials will be provided  with\r\n\r\nofficial   transport  and  buses   or   cars   for\r\n\r\npractices, games and official functions. They will\r\n\r\nbe  provided with polaroid identification tags  to\r\n\r\nenable them to travel free of charge on any of the\r\n\r\npublic  transport buses for the  duration  of  the\r\n\r\nGames.  Special  buses for the  public  will  also\r\n\r\noperate  to  as  many  of  the  Games  venues   as\r\n\r\npossible.  The  Transport  Sub-Committee  is  also\r\n\r\nlooking into the possibility of providing a launch\r\n\r\nservice from Clifford Pier to the National Stadium\r\n\r\nComplex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides programmes for the various sports\r\n\r\ndisciplines,   which  will   be   published,   the\r\n\r\nOrganising  Committee  will  also  produce   daily\r\n\r\nresult sheets and a souvenir handbook. All results\r\n\r\nof  games  will  be  channelled  to  the  National\r\n\r\nStadium  for computerisation. The National Stadium\r\n\r\nwill  also  be the official press centre  for  the\r\n\r\nGames   and  from  there  telegraphic  and   telex\r\n\r\nfacilities will also be available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to publicity for the Games, 25\r\n\r\ndifferent   articles  have   appeared   in   local\r\n\r\nnewspapers concerning the SEAP Games in Singapore.\r\n\r\nBesides   this,   the  Organising  Committee   has\r\n\r\nproduced  two colourful posters. These  have  been\r\n\r\ndistributed  to all primary and secondary  schools\r\n\r\nin   Singapore,  Government  Ministries,  and  the\r\n\r\nOlympic Committees of all the SEAP countries. More\r\n\r\nadvertising  of  the Games is  expected  from  May\r\n\r\nonwards. Radio and Television Singapore will  give\r\n\r\nat  least  an  hour's programme  for  each  sports\r\n\r\ndiscipline. The commercial firms involved  in  the\r\n\r\nGames  will also help to publicise. Souvenir coins\r\n\r\nand  commemorative stamps will  also  be  on  sale\r\n\r\nbefore the Games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertising, Sir, is a very expensive business,\r\n\r\nand  we shall cut our coat according to the cloth.\r\n\r\nIf  possible, the Organising Committee will try to\r\n\r\nproduce  a  film on the Games. If there  has  been\r\n\r\nlittle publicity thus far, the only excuse is lack\r\n\r\nof finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised certain queries.\r\n\r\nFirst,  may  I thank him for his good words  about\r\n\r\nthe  National Sports Promotion Board.  As  to  his\r\n\r\nbeing  perturbed  about how the standards  of  our\r\n\r\nsportsmen  compare internationally, I  can  assure\r\n\r\nhim  that there is no reason for him to be ashamed\r\n\r\nof Singapore's performance in sports. With a small\r\n\r\npopulation of only over two million and  the  lack\r\n\r\nof  sufficient facilities, and the lack  of  space\r\n\r\namong  other  things, we have not fared  badly  in\r\n\r\ninternational  competitions. There  are  games  in\r\n\r\nwhich other countries have done better than us but\r\n\r\nthere are games in which we shine. However, we  do\r\n\r\nadmit that with proper organisation, training  and\r\n\r\nincentive, we can certainly raise the standard  of\r\n\r\nSingapore in the international sporting world. But\r\n\r\nthis will necessarily take time. Surely you cannot\r\n\r\nproduce sportsmen or super-sportsmen in a day! One\r\n\r\nof  the ways of going about the sports problem  is\r\n\r\nto   acquire   a  broad  base  of  sportsmen   and\r\n\r\nsportswomen  from which to select. In doing  this,\r\n\r\nwe  will  also achieve the dual object in that  we\r\n\r\nwould  at  the same time be enhancing the physical\r\n\r\nhealth  and ruggedness of our youths at all levels\r\n\r\nfrom primary schools to tertiary institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that if sports were to\r\n\r\nflourish  there  is  a  need  for  sportsmen   and\r\n\r\nsportswomen  to  be given adequate incentives  for\r\n\r\nparticipation. In Western societies,  one  or  two\r\n\r\nincentives  are provided in one way or the  other.\r\n\r\nIn the East European countries, the states provide\r\n\r\nincentives  in  the  form  of  living  allowances,\r\n\r\nhousing,  and trips abroad. In our case, sportsmen\r\n\r\nare  given  some incentives as follows: unrecorded\r\n\r\nleave,  especially  for Government  employees,  to\r\n\r\nenable  them to participate in the national  teams\r\n\r\n(unrecorded leave up to a maximum of ten days  for\r\n\r\ncoaches,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreferees  and  players, to be taken  up  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Finance);  subsidised  centralised\r\n\r\ntraining for most sports and nominal allowance for\r\n\r\ntransport   and  nutrition  for  the  SEAP   Games\r\n\r\ntrainees;  free medical service for  all  national\r\n\r\nsportsmen;    provision   of   scholarships    for\r\n\r\noutstanding sportsmen who are students, and grants\r\n\r\nof credits by the Ministry of Education for pupils\r\n\r\nwith extra-curricular activities in schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Sports Promotion Board has been\r\n\r\nstudying  the situation further and realises  that\r\n\r\nthe  present incentives are still inadequate. Some\r\n\r\nof  the possible incentives which are being looked\r\n\r\ninto  are:  a scholarship scheme for all  national\r\n\r\nsportsmen; free training of national sportsmen for\r\n\r\nspecific  careers  under  the  guidance   of   the\r\n\r\nSportsmen Welfare Council; free nutrition for  all\r\n\r\nnational  sportsmen and free transport  facilities\r\n\r\nin connection with sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed timely that the Member for Anson has\r\n\r\ntouched   on   the  question  of   discipline   of\r\n\r\nsportsmen.  We instil in our sportsmen the  ideals\r\n\r\nof  dedication, integrity and loyalty as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe  need  for proper sportsmanship. By comparison\r\n\r\nwith  other countries, it cannot be said that  our\r\n\r\nsportsmen  and  sportswomen lack these  qualities.\r\n\r\nHowever,   it   is   admitted   that   there   are\r\n\r\noccasionally a few black sheep who stray away from\r\n\r\nthe   straight  and  narrow  path.  The   incident\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  the Member was one  of  those  rare\r\n\r\ninstances, and the organisation concerned had  not\r\n\r\nhesitated  to take drastic measures to  prevent  a\r\n\r\nrecurrence of such a situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants to know if, in addition to\r\n\r\nsoccer and basket-ball, it is intended to organise\r\n\r\ncompetitions  of this nature for all other  sports\r\n\r\nactivities.  The  answer  is  that  this  is   the\r\n\r\nultimate  aim.  We have started  with  soccer  and\r\n\r\nbasket-ball. This year badminton, sepak takraw and\r\n\r\ntable  tennis will be added. Other games  will  be\r\n\r\nadded in the years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the Member for River Valley,\r\n\r\nSir. He has made some very good observations and I\r\n\r\nam  very glad that he has chosen to speak strongly\r\n\r\non the inadequacies of the National\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSports  Promotion  Board. His  timely  comment  is\r\n\r\nwelcomed  but it is obvious that he is unaware  of\r\n\r\nthe  background  concerning  sports  promotion  in\r\n\r\ngeneral, and the work of the Board, in particular.\r\n\r\nIt  is  agreed  that the NSPB should  promote  all\r\n\r\nforms  of sports in the Republic. But I must  make\r\n\r\nit clear that even this general philosophy must be\r\n\r\nmodified  to  suit  the  situation  obtaining   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Firstly,  facilities  and   funds   at\r\n\r\npresent  are still very limited. Secondly,  people\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  have  a  predilection  for  certain\r\n\r\nsports and games. Thirdly, the Member is no  doubt\r\n\r\naware  that  there  are certain sports  and  games\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are  not at a physical disadvantage  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to  others.  In this  regard  there  are\r\n\r\nopposing  views to those expressed by the  Member:\r\n\r\nthat the approach to sports to attain standards of\r\n\r\nexcellence should be on a selection basis. In  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  situation, we have not  really  adopted\r\n\r\nsuch  a  selective  approach. We  have,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nadhered very closely to the principle of promoting\r\n\r\nall  sports in the Republic, although the  results\r\n\r\nachieved  and the publicity received by them  will\r\n\r\ndepend  very  much  on  the effectiveness  of  the\r\n\r\norganisations responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly untrue to say that the NSPB has\r\n\r\nbeen   promoting   only   one   or   two   sports,\r\n\r\nparticularly  soccer. For the information  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  the Pesta Sukan in 1971 and 1972 had  over\r\n\r\n30  different, sports with competitive programmes.\r\n\r\nThe NSPB has also assisted in the organisation  of\r\n\r\nthe Asian Cycling Championship and the Pan-Pacific\r\n\r\nKarate Championship and other international sports\r\n\r\nevents, including the Grand Prix in Singapore. The\r\n\r\nimpression  that  soccer is  receiving  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nattention  from the NSPB partly springs  from  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  it is one of the few games which  have\r\n\r\nbeen introduced into the inter-constituency sports\r\n\r\nand  partly  because  of its popularity  with  the\r\n\r\nsporting   public   in  Singapore.   Football   is\r\n\r\ninternationally  a  major sport.  We  cannot  deny\r\n\r\nthat,  and  the  need for it  to  be  revived  and\r\n\r\npromoted  from  its position in the  doldrums  two\r\n\r\nyears ago was obvious. The NSPB was asked to take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover the administration of football in a caretaker-capacity by the Football Association of Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  the  Board  very  reluctantly  accepted  this\r\n\r\nresponsibility  because of the  critical  need  in\r\n\r\nJuly  1971. The intention was that the Board would\r\n\r\ndo  this  for two to three years to set the  right\r\n\r\nplans  and  finances for bringing  football  to  a\r\n\r\nproper level in Singapore over the period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may be pleased to know that the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  soccer has gone up many  times  over\r\n\r\nsince  the  NSPB became involved in its promotion.\r\n\r\nThe  national  team is now ranked  in  the  middle\r\n\r\norder of the All-Asian national teams. It is hoped\r\n\r\nthat  in the foreseeable future, the Republic  can\r\n\r\nemerge as one of the leading teams in Asia. It  is\r\n\r\nalso  noticeable that more and more people now  go\r\n\r\nto   the   Jalan  Besar  stadium  to   watch   the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  our national team.  Despite  this\r\n\r\nachievement, there is still much to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to correct the erroneous\r\n\r\nimpression  the  Member had concerning  the  match\r\n\r\nbetween   the   Football  Association  President's\r\n\r\nEleven  and a Japanese club team. It is  incorrect\r\n\r\nfor the Member to say that a few paying spectators\r\n\r\nwere  requested just before the match to represent\r\n\r\nSingapore  in this match. To put the facts  right,\r\n\r\nthe  House may wish to know that the national team\r\n\r\nwas  not  involved  in this match.  Three  of  the\r\n\r\nplayers  were  invited to play  for  the  Football\r\n\r\nAssociation President's Eleven, and they were from\r\n\r\nthe   Farrer  Park  team,  which  was  the  inter-constituency  champion.  They  were   not   paying\r\n\r\nspectators in any sense of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On overseas trips for the soccer team, it is true\r\n\r\nthat the team did make eight trips overseas during\r\n\r\nthe past year. But this was in accordance with the\r\n\r\nAsian football calendar. All expenses involved  in\r\n\r\ntravel were borne by the host nation which invited\r\n\r\nus.  The NSPB did not put in a single cent. As for\r\n\r\nthe King's Cup tournament in Thailand, it is again\r\n\r\nregretted  that  the Member was misinformed.  Only\r\n\r\nsix  officials accompanied the team. Four of them,\r\n\r\nnamely the manager, the assistant manager, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncoach  and  the referee, were invited by Thailand,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the tournament regulations.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore untrue to say that the NSPB paid for the\r\n\r\nexpenses  of five of the officials. In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nNSPB,  as I have said just now, is not financially\r\n\r\ninvolved  at  all  with the  project.  The  entire\r\n\r\nexpenses  for these officials and the  17  players\r\n\r\nwere  borne  by  the  Thai  Football  Association.\r\n\r\nExcept for two officials whose expenses were  paid\r\n\r\nby  the  FAS,  the entire expenses for  the  other\r\n\r\nofficials  and  players were  borne  by  the  Thai\r\n\r\nFootball Association. The Member should also  note\r\n\r\nthat  it  is the FAS, and not the NSPB,  which  is\r\n\r\nplanning a tour of Australia and New Zealand later\r\n\r\nthis  year for the soccer team, provided  it  does\r\n\r\nreasonably well in the coming SEAP Games.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  an excellent incentive,  and  most\r\n\r\nsports organisations should try to provide similar\r\n\r\nincentives to their participants and endeavour  to\r\n\r\nraise  funds  to  give Singapore's  sportsmen  the\r\n\r\nneeded experience in competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Member's question as to how much\r\n\r\nmoney  the  NSPB had spent in promoting soccer  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to  other sports, I wish to  inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse that a sum of $24,500 was spent by the Board\r\n\r\nduring the past year. Of this amount, $18,000  was\r\n\r\nspent  on  the  organisation of inter-constituency\r\n\r\nfootball tournaments which is a worthwhile project\r\n\r\nand   one   that  helps  to  launch   the   inter-constituency  sports, which will be the  framework\r\n\r\nfor the promotion of sporting activities among the\r\n\r\npeople  at  grass-root  level.  Of  the  remaining\r\n\r\namount, $5,000 was given to the FAS for organising\r\n\r\nthe  Pesta  Sukan Football Tournament. The  amount\r\n\r\nallotted to football was not unduly high  in  view\r\n\r\nof  the popularity of the game. The Board allotted\r\n\r\n$25,980   for  basketball,  $53,907  for  cycling,\r\n\r\n$20,645  for  tennis, $14,500 for  school  sports,\r\n\r\n$20,358  for  motor sports, $13,475  approximately\r\n\r\nfor  athletics  and $11,510 for  badminton.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  these,  21  other sports, from  billiard  to\r\n\r\nChinese  chess, also received certain  allocations\r\n\r\nin  varying amounts, depending of course on  their\r\n\r\nfinancial position and their needs and activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Medicine Unit of the NSPB was launched\r\n\r\nin  June  1971. The Board has accepted  plans  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment which are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage 1 - an outpatient clinic to take care of\r\n\r\nthe national sportsmen;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage 2 - a physiotherapy clinic to aid the\r\n\r\ntreatment of patients;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage 3 - the provision of ancillary facilities,\r\n\r\nsuch as laboratories and surgical facilities;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage 4 - a centre for research into human\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  format is originated because each stage will\r\n\r\ncost  increasing sums of money. Up to-date, stages\r\n\r\n1 and 2 are in progress. The department is limited\r\n\r\nto   a   staff  of  two  - one  doctor   and   one\r\n\r\nphysiotherapist.  The  medical  officer  is   also\r\n\r\nappointed   by  the  Board  to  be  the  assistant\r\n\r\ndirector   in   charge  of  promotion,   research,\r\n\r\ntraining, commercial development and publications.\r\n\r\nA total of $42,893 has been spent on equipment for\r\n\r\nthe treatment of patients. Because of the lack  of\r\n\r\nequipment and manpower, the primary purpose of the\r\n\r\nUnit  is  to provide medical care for our national\r\n\r\nsportsmen.  It  is  not possible  to  launch  into\r\n\r\nsophisticated  research on  physical  performances\r\n\r\nuntil more staff and equipment can be acquired. In\r\n\r\nthe  year 1972, as I said at the beginning  of  my\r\n\r\nreply,  more  than  600  national  sportsmen  were\r\n\r\ntreated and 4,500 treatments, were prescribed  and\r\n\r\ncarried out. This does not take into consideration\r\n\r\nthe  number of patients treated during  the  Pesta\r\n\r\nSukan and other international games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A research project is under-way to determine the\r\n\r\ntrend  of sports injuries in Singapore, and it  is\r\n\r\nhoped that with added support from the Government,\r\n\r\nthe  Unit  will  in  future be  able  to  do  more\r\n\r\nintensive physiological research to assist coaches\r\n\r\nand  sportsmen. During the two years of existence,\r\n\r\nthe  NSPB  has found great difficulty  in  finding\r\n\r\nsenior personnel of the right calibre to run  both\r\n\r\nthe Sports Medicine and the Research, Planning and\r\n\r\nTraining units. Due to this, the present incumbent\r\n\r\nwho\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis,   in  fact,  the  only  specialist  in  sports\r\n\r\nmedicine  in  Singapore is found to  be  the  most\r\n\r\nsuitable person to run both these units.  This  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  to  be  an  ideal  arrangement  which,\r\n\r\nbesides  fitting in with the requirements  of  the\r\n\r\nNational  Sports Promotion Board,  will  also  cut\r\n\r\ndown expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to deal with the subject of inter-constituency sports in age group competitions. I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the Board has achieved much in  inter-constituency sports which has been introduced  for\r\n\r\nthe  first  time in Singapore. From all points  of\r\n\r\nview,  the  football  and basket-ball  tournaments\r\n\r\nhave   been   a  great  success.  The   Board   is\r\n\r\nconsidering  the  implementation  of   age   group\r\n\r\ncompetition to be incorporated into the concept of\r\n\r\ninter-constituency sports. The reasons  are  many,\r\n\r\nand some of the pertinent ones are as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age group competition held in conjunction with\r\n\r\ninter-constituency sports will bring about  social\r\n\r\nintegration. One of the shortcomings of our  urban\r\n\r\nsociety  today is the wall which some of us  built\r\n\r\namong ourselves. These artificial social walls can\r\n\r\nbe broken if children and parents are all involved\r\n\r\nin  sports and games as a community endeavour.  ]t\r\n\r\nis  important that the youths of Singapore  should\r\n\r\ndirectly  identify themselves with the  activities\r\n\r\nwithin their own constituencies. They must develop\r\n\r\na  sense  of identification and attachment towards\r\n\r\ntheir   constituency.  Through   the   age   group\r\n\r\ncompetition, it may be possible to bring  about  a\r\n\r\nsituation  in which people of all ages can  mingle\r\n\r\non  common ground and engage in meaningful  sports\r\n\r\nactivities.  Parents  can  play  alongside   their\r\n\r\nchildren. In this way, more parents will  take  an\r\n\r\ninterest in the activities of their children. From\r\n\r\npast  experience,  we feel that  the  standard  of\r\n\r\nsports  is likely to improve if the youths of  our\r\n\r\ncountry  are  given  added  incentives  and  added\r\n\r\nopportunities outside the school environment. I am\r\n\r\nsure  the Member for River Valley will agree  with\r\n\r\nme  that his prowess in water polo goalkeeping was\r\n\r\ndeveloped  in  a  Pasir Panjang club  rather  than\r\n\r\ndirect training\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreceived from his school. This argument holds true\r\n\r\nfor   the   majority  of  our  top  sportsmen   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to allay the fears of the Member that\r\n\r\nschool   children  will  be  taxed  beyond   their\r\n\r\ncapacity  and that there will be a duplication  of\r\n\r\nactivities,  I  wish  to assure  him  that  future\r\n\r\nplanning  for  age  group  competitions  will   be\r\n\r\norganised  in close liaison with the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation for the implementation of a scheme which\r\n\r\nwill   benefit  the  schools  as   well   as   the\r\n\r\nconstituency sports organisation. My Ministry  has\r\n\r\nalready   taken  note  of  the  difficulties   and\r\n\r\nreservations expressed by a number of  Members  in\r\n\r\nregard  to the lack of organisational capacity  in\r\n\r\ntheir  constituencies in launching  this  project.\r\n\r\nAnd  my  Ministry has since reviewed the  position\r\n\r\nand  has  decided  that age group  competition  at\r\n\r\ninter-constituency level will be implemented at  a\r\n\r\nlater stage, taking cognizance of the readiness of\r\n\r\nthe   various   constituencies  in   participating\r\n\r\nmeaningfully in this worthwhile project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the administration of the NSPB, it is\r\n\r\npremature to prejudge its performance, since it is\r\n\r\nonly  two  years old. The staff of  the  NSPB  has\r\n\r\nworked under terrific pressure and handicap  owing\r\n\r\nto  the  lack of adequate manpower and finance.  I\r\n\r\nneed say nothing more about this organisation than\r\n\r\nthat   its   officials   have   shown   tremendous\r\n\r\ndedication and initiative in their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  thank  the  Minister for  Social  Affairs  for\r\n\r\nclearing away some of my erroneous statements. But\r\n\r\nI  would  like to comment, in particular,  on  the\r\n\r\nfootball  incident.  As I  said,  I  read  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  about this incident and I  would  have\r\n\r\nthought that the person in charge of the FAS,  who\r\n\r\nis  also  an  official of the NSPB,  should  have,\r\n\r\nwithout  any  hesitation,  clarified  this   point\r\n\r\nstraightaway  in the press. I keep saying  that  I\r\n\r\nread it in the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the sporting public has read about this\r\n\r\nincident  and  came  to  the  conclusion  as   was\r\n\r\nreported in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnewspapers. May I suggest that the NSPB or the FAS\r\n\r\nshould  correct  this erroneous statement  in  the\r\n\r\npress immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity of\r\n\r\nmaking a suggestion on the publicity for the  SEAP\r\n\r\nGames.  My  personal view is that up  to  now  the\r\n\r\npublicity is extremely limited. One only sees  the\r\n\r\nSEAP  Games advertisement on the back of buses  of\r\n\r\none  bus  company out of the three bus  companies,\r\n\r\nand also stickers on some official cars. Since  so\r\n\r\nmuch  effort  has been put in by the various  sub-committees  to  make the Games a  success,  may  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that without due and forceful  publicity,\r\n\r\nthe  Games may not be a success. Perhaps the  SIA,\r\n\r\nlike  other international airlines elsewhere  when\r\n\r\norganising international games, can publicise  the\r\n\r\nGames  by flying the SEAP Games flag on its  daily\r\n\r\nflights  as  part of its campaign to attract  more\r\n\r\ntourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that it is not the\r\n\r\nintention   of  our  exercise  here  to  criticise\r\n\r\nunfairly the administration of the NSPB.  I  share\r\n\r\nthe  view  that the NSPB officials  may  be  under\r\n\r\nundue  strain  and pressure. Sir, to  give  you  a\r\n\r\nsimple  illustration,  the  very  fact  that   one\r\n\r\nmedical  officer  is made to take  charge  of  two\r\n\r\nunits  is burdensome. On top of that, putting  him\r\n\r\nin  charge of promotion, research, training and so\r\n\r\non,  is,  I think, humanly impossible. There  have\r\n\r\nbeen a few complaints from sportsmen to the effect\r\n\r\nthat,  on arriving at the medical unit, they asked\r\n\r\nfor  the medical officer and were told that he was\r\n\r\nentertaining  or  that  he  was  showing  somebody\r\n\r\naround. For the good and efficient functioning  of\r\n\r\nthe  Sports Medicine Unit, and since the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  correctly stated that the medical officer  is\r\n\r\nthe  only specialist on sports medicine,  then  he\r\n\r\nshould be strictly confined to this area of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all the three\r\n\r\nsuggestions  of  the Member have been  noted.  The\r\n\r\nfirst   suggestion  has  been  rectified   by   my\r\n\r\nclarification. The second suggestion is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing handled by the publicity subcommittee, and I\r\n\r\nam  sure they will get in touch with SIA, to  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  details of the publicity. On the  third\r\n\r\nsuggestion, as I have said, it is so difficult  to\r\n\r\nget  a person to take charge of the various posts.\r\n\r\nAt  the present moment, the medical officer is put\r\n\r\nin  charge  of the various posts, as  a  temporary\r\n\r\nmeasure. Later on, when we find a suitable person,\r\n\r\nthe  medical officer will then be relieved of  his\r\n\r\nother duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now deal with the queries raised by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Kampung Kembangan. The Member  has\r\n\r\nexpressed   the  need  for  more  facilities   for\r\n\r\nsportsmen  in  the State. As I have said,  we  are\r\n\r\naware  of this. For his information, Sir,  on  the\r\n\r\ncompletion  of  the  National  Sports  Complex  at\r\n\r\nKallang,  which  is  quite close  to  Geylang  and\r\n\r\nKampung   Kembangan,  swimming  pools  and   other\r\n\r\nfacilities  will be made available to the  people,\r\n\r\nincluding    those    from    his    constituency.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Housing and Development Board  is\r\n\r\nplanning  to build a swimming pool in  the  Katong\r\n\r\narea  in  future, and this will be  an  additional\r\n\r\nfacility which the people in his constituency  can\r\n\r\nenjoy.  However,  it  is  the  intention   of   my\r\n\r\nMinistry,  in  conjunction with the Ministries  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development and Education, the  Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment and the NSPB, to look into the  overall\r\n\r\nrequirements of sports facilities in Singapore  in\r\n\r\nthe near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the use of school facilities for\r\n\r\nconstituency  sports,  my  Ministry   is   working\r\n\r\nclosely with the Ministry of Education to see what\r\n\r\nfurther  arrangements  can  be  made  for   school\r\n\r\nfacilities  to be used for this purpose.  However,\r\n\r\nit  must  be  recognised that  there  are  certain\r\n\r\nlimitations  because of the afternoon sessions  in\r\n\r\nmost  schools,  which go on into the  evening.  In\r\n\r\nthis  regard, the Ministry of Education  has  been\r\n\r\nmost   accommodating  in  allowing   many   school\r\n\r\nfacilities  to  be  used by the constituencies  on\r\n\r\nrequest. However, it is to be appreciated that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool facilities are now very extensively used by\r\n\r\nthe schools themselves. Therefore, it is sometimes\r\n\r\ndifficult to share such facilities since  priority\r\n\r\nmust  be  given  to school sports activities.  The\r\n\r\nMember  can  rest  assured  that  there  is  close\r\n\r\nliaison  between the Ministries of  Education  and\r\n\r\nSocial Affairs and the NSPB on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many countries concerned with the promotion of\r\n\r\nsports  for  their  entire  population  invariably\r\n\r\nprovide  large amounts of funds for the  provision\r\n\r\nof  primary facilities which determine the success\r\n\r\nor failure of sports programmes and activities. It\r\n\r\nis no surprise therefore that in Singapore the top\r\n\r\nthree  teams  in  the inter-constituency  football\r\n\r\ntournament  came from Farrer Park,  Pasir  Panjang\r\n\r\nand   Sembawang,   where   more   facilities   are\r\n\r\navailable. The Government's involvement in  sports\r\n\r\npromotion must be seen in relation to its  overall\r\n\r\neffort  in  nation building, since  in  many  ways\r\n\r\nphysical fitness and sports contribute to national\r\n\r\nwealth  and economic and material output. In  some\r\n\r\ncountries,  as much as 4 per cent of the  national\r\n\r\nbudget  is  put  aside for sports promotion.  East\r\n\r\nGermany  is said to have spent about $900  million\r\n\r\nover  the past four years to make the country more\r\n\r\nsports  conscious and better equipped with  sports\r\n\r\nfacilities as a preparation for the Munich  Games,\r\n\r\nand   the  results  spoke  for  themselves.   West\r\n\r\nGermany,  which has a 15-year Golden Plan starting\r\n\r\nin 1960, now spends about $1,700 million a year in\r\n\r\npublic  expenditure on only primary and  secondary\r\n\r\ncommunity  sports facilities. This  works  out  to\r\n\r\nover  $40  per  capita.  In addition,  substantial\r\n\r\namounts of money are provided for the promotion of\r\n\r\nleisure  and  competitive sports in  sports  clubs\r\n\r\nthroughout the federal and provincial states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for more financial resources for the\r\n\r\npromotion  of  sports  in Singapore  is  therefore\r\n\r\nobvious.  I  would  like to urge  that  a  certain\r\n\r\npercentage of the national budget be allocated for\r\n\r\nsports promotion and for the development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  primary  and  secondary  facilities  for\r\n\r\npublic  leisure  and competitive sports.  However,\r\n\r\ndespite   the   present   inadequacy   of   sports\r\n\r\nfacilities    at    constituency    level,     the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the inter-constituency  sports\r\n\r\nproject  could be carried out still  further  with\r\n\r\nimaginative planning and close liaison with school\r\n\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other Members have also raised many queries\r\n\r\nwhich  are somewhat similar to those which I  have\r\n\r\nalready  explained, and I hope they are  satisfied\r\n\r\nwith what I have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, can I get an assurance\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister  that he  will  look  into  my\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that SIA allows concession rates,  say\r\n\r\n50  per  cent, for our top athletes going overseas\r\n\r\nfor international sports meets?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> I am not in charge of SIA, but\r\n\r\nI  will  raise the matter with those  who  are  in\r\n\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister said in his reply that in  order  to\r\n\r\nencourage players and representatives to represent\r\n\r\nthe  national  teams  in competitions,  permission\r\n\r\nwill  be granted to them to take unrecorded  leave\r\n\r\nfor  training in such activities.

I have received many complaints from\r\n\r\nprospective  pilgrims on all kinds of exploitation\r\n\r\nby  these  brokers.

The\r\n\r\nPilgrimage Committee is considering the  provision\r\n\r\nof medical facilities, including the services of a\r\n\r\ndoctor and a nurse for the pilgrims when they  are\r\n\r\nin  Mecca.

The Muslim Religious Council  has  not\r\n\r\nyet   taken  over  the  responsibility  of  giving\r\n\r\nassistance  to  these religious schools.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  religious  schools  are  not  run  properly\r\n\r\nbecause they are faced with all sorts of problems.\r\n\r\nThe  syllabuses are not properly planned  and  are\r\n\r\ndifferent,  because between one  religious  school\r\n\r\nand  another, they teach different subjects. Since\r\n\r\nthe  Council has taken over the management of many\r\n\r\nmosques  in Singapore, surely it can do  the  same\r\n\r\nfor  the religious schools. I understand that with\r\n\r\nregard   to  mosques  there  are  no  difficulties\r\n\r\nbecause the premises are well constructed. But  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of religious schools, the condition  of\r\n\r\nthe building is in a sorry state. So also with the\r\n\r\nsyllabuses used by the religious schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Muslim Religious Council allows this\r\n\r\nsituation  to continue and is keeping quiet  about\r\n\r\nit,  and  does not make any effort to correct  it,\r\n\r\nthen  its  standing  in  the  community  will   be\r\n\r\naffected.  Muslims  in Singapore  will  also  lose\r\n\r\nconfidence   in   it.  Muslim   organisations   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   such   as   the   All-Malaya   Muslim\r\n\r\nMissionary Society, can he considered to  be  more\r\n\r\nactive  than the Muslim Religious Council  itself.\r\n\r\nThe  tithes collected are supposed to be  used  by\r\n\r\nthe  Council  for the welfare of  the  Muslims  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  whereas the honoraria of  the  Council\r\n\r\nstaff  are paid by the Government. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nMuslim Religious Council should find it easier  to\r\n\r\nrun  its activities than the Muslim organisations.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is regrettable to note that the Muslim\r\n\r\nReligious  Council  has  failed  in  many  of  its\r\n\r\nfunctions.  The Muslim voluntary organisations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore have instead done better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampung Kembangan talked about the\r\n\r\npilgrims  just  now.  The failure  of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\nReligious Council to arrange chartered flights for\r\n\r\npilgrims  to  Mecca  in  the  previous   year   is\r\n\r\nsomething which cannot be denied. This is proof of\r\n\r\nits weakness because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  was not prepared to make concerted efforts. It\r\n\r\nwas  only  prepared to stand still and watch.  The\r\n\r\nMuslim  Religious Council should make more efforts\r\n\r\nin  this  respect and should not keep quiet  about\r\n\r\nthis  matter. Even the rice on the plate will  not\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the  stomach if it  is  not  fed  to  the\r\n\r\nperson.  The Muslim Religious Council should  have\r\n\r\norganised   chartered  flights   for   prospective\r\n\r\npilgrims   to   Mecca.  The  PKMS  (United   Malay\r\n\r\nOrganisation,  Singapore),  which   is   a   Malay\r\n\r\npolitical party in Singapore, has also looked into\r\n\r\nthis matter. The Minister concerned should ask the\r\n\r\nMuslim  Religious Council to do its part  for  the\r\n\r\nMuslims in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to Muslim religious schools, they are\r\n\r\nvery  important  because they can  give  religious\r\n\r\ninstruction  to  our  children.  If   the   Muslim\r\n\r\nReligious  Council also failed to make efforts  in\r\n\r\nthis  field,  people  will go  to  the  mosque  in\r\n\r\nreduced  numbers.  Religious instruction  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.  Therefore, the syllabus for  religious\r\n\r\ninstruction in schools must be improved. It is the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Council to see that this  is\r\n\r\nbeing done. The tithes collected from Muslims  can\r\n\r\nbe  used  for religious purposes in the  Republic,\r\n\r\nbut  the money should not be misused to the extent\r\n\r\nthat  children  studying in the religious  schools\r\n\r\nare  looked upon as step-children by this Council.\r\n\r\nI  know that the tithes collected are only used to\r\n\r\nprovide  scholarships for students.  But  can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  inform this House as to how  much  money\r\n\r\nhas  been  spent  on  scholarships  for  religious\r\n\r\nstudents?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Kampung Kembangan may wish to know that\r\n\r\nthe   Majlis   Ugama  Islam  has   been   actively\r\n\r\nconsidering  the implementation of  a  scheme  for\r\n\r\nHaji  air  flights to assist local Muslim pilgrims\r\n\r\nto  go  to  Jeddah.  Unfortunately,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nprovision in the Administration of Muslim Law  Act\r\n\r\nto  empower the Majlis to operate such  a  scheme.\r\n\r\nThe Majlis has also considered the formation of  a\r\n\r\nco-operative for this purpose, and it has  carried\r\n\r\nout a survey among local Muslim pilgrims to find\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  if they would respond to special arrangements\r\n\r\nfor  chartered flights. But the call of the Majlis\r\n\r\nfor  registration  met  with  poor  response.   It\r\n\r\nappears  that  the  present arrangements  made  by\r\n\r\ntravel  agencies  are  preferred  by  these  local\r\n\r\nMuslim  pilgrims. These agencies handled  12  such\r\n\r\nflights   from   Singapore  in   1971   with   827\r\n\r\npassengers,  and  13  flights  in  1972  with  492\r\n\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards complaints about the treatment\r\n\r\naccorded to our pilgrims during their stay in  the\r\n\r\nholy  cities  of  Mecca  and  Medina,  since   the\r\n\r\narrangements   overseas   are   not   handled   by\r\n\r\nSingapore, there is not much that we can do except\r\n\r\nto request the foreign authorities responsible for\r\n\r\nthe  pilgrimage  to improve their services.  As  I\r\n\r\nunderstand it, the Shaik Hajis, or agents who take\r\n\r\ncharge  of  the  pilgrims in Mecca,  have  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  role  to  play in the  welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npilgrims. They are paid for their services and the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  the services is dependent  upon  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of pilgrims each Shaik Hajis looks  after.\r\n\r\nThis means that the smaller the number, the better\r\n\r\nthe standard of the services rendered. We have  no\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  these Shaik Hajis in Mecca.  It  is\r\n\r\nentirely left to the pilgrims themselves to select\r\n\r\ntheir own Shaik Hajis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the queries raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai, I regret to inform him, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  Majlis  is  not ready yet to  take  over  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of all religious schools in Singapore,\r\n\r\nas  it  lacks  the  necessary staff  to  do  this.\r\n\r\nHowever,  a  sub-committee,  with  the  Mufti   as\r\n\r\nchairman,  has already been formed and is  charged\r\n\r\nwith    the    responsibility   of   standardising\r\n\r\nsyllabuses  for religious instruction.  This  sub-committee  has  been  functioning  for  over  five\r\n\r\nmonths  now,  and  I understand  that  significant\r\n\r\nprogress has been made. It is anticipated that the\r\n\r\nrevision of the curriculum for the primary  levels\r\n\r\nwill  be completed by next year. The sub-committee\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  looking into  ways  and  means  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  standard  of teaching  by  religious\r\n\r\nteachers. In this regard, the hon.

What I said was that the Majlis  should\r\n\r\nassist local pilgrims who wish to proceed to Mecca\r\n\r\nby   making  arrangements  for  special  chartered\r\n\r\nflights.  The Minister has said that there  is  no\r\n\r\nprovision in the Administration of Muslim Law Act.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  Sir,  there  exists  a   Pilgrimage\r\n\r\nDepartment which looks after and assists the local\r\n\r\npilgrims who travel by sea.

In  effect,  the actual  number  of  cases\r\n\r\nhandled by the Legal Aid Bureau is much higher, in\r\n\r\nview  of  the  fact  that many cases  have  to  be\r\n\r\nfollowed up in the succeeding year. Normally  each\r\n\r\ncase takes a period of time to be completed. There\r\n\r\nare many reasons for this, since it takes time for\r\n\r\nthe  Bureau  to obtain the relevant evidence  from\r\n\r\nthe  applicant  and  to obtain  replies  from  the\r\n\r\nopposing  parties  who often do  not  give  prompt\r\n\r\nreplies. These cases also take time in view of the\r\n\r\nneed to obtain reports, notes of evidence, and  so\r\n\r\non,  from the various departments. For legal cases\r\n\r\nwhich  are  complicated, more time is required  in\r\n\r\nview of the involved court proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau is doing its best to deal with the\r\n\r\ncases as quickly as possible. T am quite satisfied\r\n\r\nthat there has been no undue delay on the part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Legal Aid Bureau in handling the cases. I  am\r\n\r\nalso  aware that the case-load is mounting, and  I\r\n\r\nshall  not  hesitate  to recommend  the  necessary\r\n\r\nexpansion and increase of staff to meet the  needs\r\n\r\nof  the Bureau, when the time comes for this to be\r\n\r\ndone.  But  for the moment the Bureau is  able  to\r\n\r\ncope   with  its  commitment  and  is  functioning\r\n\r\nsmoothly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I be permitted to make some observations with\r\n\r\nregard to the work of the Legal Aid Bureau? I have\r\n\r\nno doubt that the Bureau is rendering an excellent\r\n\r\nservice.   However,  I  have  similarly   received\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of  delay on the part of  the  Bureau.\r\n\r\nQuite  apart  from the shortage  of  personnel,  I\r\n\r\nsuspect  that  the  delay might  well  be  due  to\r\n\r\nlanguage,  because the majority of the people  who\r\n\r\nseek  the  help of the Legal Aid Bureau  are  non-English speaking.

The  facilities  in  these  other\r\n\r\nsports venues are not up to standard, and I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask whether the Government is  going  to\r\n\r\nimprove  these facilities. Moreover, if  a  sports\r\n\r\nvenue is privately-owned, is it the responsibility\r\n\r\nof the owner to improve the facilities there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about safety measures and security\r\n\r\nmeasures?  Will  they also be  considered  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment? About two years ago, during a  basket-bail  tournament at the Gay World Stadium,  a  fan\r\n\r\ndropped  from the ceiling and its wiring  hit  the\r\n\r\nsteel  pillar  and  caused  electric  sparks.   In\r\n\r\nanother  incident, the match was so exciting  that\r\n\r\nit  nearly  caused a riot, and the  doors  of  the\r\n\r\nentrances  were  forcibly broken. I  am  therefore\r\n\r\nquite  concerned about the security  measures  and\r\n\r\nsafety  measures  at these various privately-owned\r\n\r\nvenues.   I  would  like  the  Minister  to   give\r\n\r\nconsideration to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true\r\n\r\nthat venues, other than those under the management\r\n\r\nof  the  National Sports Promotion Board, will  be\r\n\r\nused  for  the  SEAP Games.

The\r\n\r\nrecipients have to wait for a very long  time  for\r\n\r\ntheir  money  as the queue is very long.

This\r\n\r\npopulation  figure of destitutes does not  include\r\n\r\nanother   100  male  destitutes  and  120   female\r\n\r\ndestitutes  who have, due to lack of accommodation\r\n\r\nat   Bushey   Park   Home,   to   be   temporarily\r\n\r\naccommodated in other Welfare Homes not meant  for\r\n\r\nthem. As such, it is essentially vital to build as\r\n\r\nsoon  as possible an additional Home for Destitute\r\n\r\nPersons  to relieve the congestion at Bushey  Park\r\n\r\nHome and to train those destitutes who are fit and\r\n\r\nstrong  enough  to  be  employable,  for  eventual\r\n\r\nemployment so that they can become useful citizens\r\n\r\nof Singapore. Due to the compact, congested nature\r\n\r\nof  the  Bushey Park Home, it is not possible  nor\r\n\r\npractical  to conduct effectively any training  or\r\n\r\nrehabilitation programme for the inmates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desired new Home will have five dormitory\r\n\r\nblocks,   a   Medical  Block,  Recreation   Block,\r\n\r\nKitchen/Dining  Block, Workshops,  Staff  Quarters\r\n\r\nand other ancillary buildings. It is hoped that  a\r\n\r\n10-acre  piece of land will soon be made available\r\n\r\nby  the  Government  for this project,  since  the\r\n\r\ndormitories,  workshops and other  buildings  will\r\n\r\noccupy  about  four acres with the  remaining  six\r\n\r\nacres   to  be  utilised  for  farming  and  other\r\n\r\ntraining  and rehabilitative activities.  The  new\r\n\r\nHome  will  have  facilities for both  indoor  and\r\n\r\nOutdoor  training with a view to  cultivating  and\r\n\r\ninstilling  in the able-bodied destitutes  a  work\r\n\r\nhabit  for outside employment rather than allowing\r\n\r\nthem  to  remain  a  continuing charge  on  public\r\n\r\nfunds.
