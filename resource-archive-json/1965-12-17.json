Four  years\r\n\r\nlater  in 1963, representations were made by taxi owners\r\n\r\nthat there was difficulty in looking for taxi drivers to\r\n\r\nman  their  vehicles. Petitions had also been  submitted\r\n\r\nfrom  members  of the public asking for a resumption  of\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of taxi driving licences. Because  of  these\r\n\r\npetitions, a Committee was appointed by the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in 1963 to ascertain the correct ratio of  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  to the number of second class hackney carriages\r\n\r\n(i.e., taxis).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1963, there were 3,185 motor vehicles licensed as\r\n\r\nsecond class hackney carriages, i.e., as taxis. If it is\r\n\r\nargued  that  all these vehicles were operating,  and  2\r\n\r\ndrivers  are required to operate one taxi during  a  \r\n\r\n24-hour period, then the total number of taxi drivers would\r\n\r\nbe  6,370. This simple arithmetic, however, does not fit\r\n\r\ninto  the actual requirements of the taxi business. Taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers,  like all other workers, must have  their  rest\r\n\r\ndays  in any week, and it is not always possible  for  a\r\n\r\ntaxi  driver  to  remain at the wheel  continuously  for\r\n\r\nperiods as long as 12 hours at a stretch. Therefore, the\r\n\r\ntotal  number  of  persons that  would  be  required  to\r\n\r\noperate  the  3,185 taxis is actually  higher  than  the\r\n\r\nfigure  of 6,370, and a ratio of 3 drivers to  one  taxi\r\n\r\nwould  probably  be more correct, giving allowances  for\r\n\r\nsick  leave,  resignations, etc. This should  bring  the\r\n\r\nfigure  of  persons  holding taxi  driving  licences  to\r\n\r\n9,555.  In  actual fact, at the end of 1963  there  were\r\n\r\n9,841  persons holding taxi drivers' licences.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  Committee found that not all these licence  holders\r\n\r\nwere engaged in driving taxis as a full-time occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was ascertained that a great number of these\r\n\r\nlicence holders either were not engaged in driving taxis\r\n\r\nat all, or were only engaged in driving taxis as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  part-time occupation. Some of these licence  holders,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the evidence submitted to the  Committee,\r\n\r\nare   shop   assistants,  hawkers,  lorry   drivers   or\r\n\r\nattendants, bus drivers or conductors, subordinate staff\r\n\r\nin  commercial firms, and even Government servants. They\r\n\r\ndrive taxis whenever they can during public holidays  or\r\n\r\nduring  their off-duty hours to earn some extra  income.\r\n\r\nThere  are other licence holders who, although they  are\r\n\r\nat the moment not engaged in driving taxis at all, renew\r\n\r\ntheir licences year after year with a view to making use\r\n\r\nof  them  in  case they lose their present jobs.  Yet  a\r\n\r\nnumber of the licence holders are garage owners or motor\r\n\r\nmechanics who require these licences to drive taxis  for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of testing the vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these various reasons, it was decided to resume\r\n\r\nthe issue of taxi driving licences but only to those who\r\n\r\nwere   unemployed  and  had  registered  at  the  Labour\r\n\r\nExchange. At present, l3,414 taxi driving licences have\r\n\r\nbeen issued, but this figure is small in comparison with\r\n\r\nthe  total number of ordinary driing licences  which  is\r\n\r\n368,408.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem does not lie in the number of holders of\r\n\r\ntaxi  driving  licences  but  in  the  number  of  taxis\r\n\r\npermitted  to  ply on the roads. At present,  there  are\r\n\r\n3,193  taxis.  The Government had in the Past  indicated\r\n\r\nthat  the number of taxis plying on the roads must  have\r\n\r\nrelationship to public demand and that the number  would\r\n\r\nbe reviewed from time to time. It is my intention now to\r\n\r\nreview the position of public transport and I shall  set\r\n\r\nup a Committee to investigate and make recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, can the Minister indicate when he intends to set up\r\n\r\nthis Committee and if he will include the Singapore Taxi\r\n\r\nDrivers' Association on it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): This matter will be\r\n\r\nconsidered  and  even  if they  are  not  selected,  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  will still receive opinions which  they  hope\r\n\r\nmay be constructive in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMMUNITY CENTRES AT JALAN PENGGAGA AND GEYLANG SERAI</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister of\r\n\r\nDefence  (a) whether Government has any plans to improve\r\n\r\nthe  community centre at Jalan Penggaga and to construct\r\n\r\nadditional  ones in the Geylang Serai Constituency;  and\r\n\r\n(b) when will such plans be implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the community\r\n\r\ncentre  at Jalan Penggaga is housed in a building  which\r\n\r\nis  rented from one person who is not in Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nthe  land belongs to another party. Therefore, it is not\r\n\r\nadvisable  to  spend money on structural improvement  in\r\n\r\nthese   circumstances.  Improvement  of  all   community\r\n\r\ncentres  in  other respects is continually attempted  by\r\n\r\nway  of  recruitment of better qualified staff, training\r\n\r\nof  staff and appointment of management committees.  The\r\n\r\nAssemblyman  of the area is usually invited  to  be  the\r\n\r\nadviser  of  the  management committee  and  it  is  his\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  as much as that of the  Government,  to\r\n\r\nimprove   the  amenities  and  activities  of  community\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the second part of the question, the\r\n\r\nGovernment   plans  to  build  another   standard   type\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre  at Geylang Serai.  In  fact,  it  has\r\n\r\nalready acquired a site.

The owner of  the  building  is  now\r\n\r\nstaying,  I  am  told,  in Indonesia.  The  landlord  is\r\n\r\nsomewhere else. Obviously it is a risky thing to  effect\r\n\r\nimprovements to this particular place. Geylang Serai, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is  fortunate in having at least one  community\r\n\r\ncentre.

For  this\r\n\r\nreason, during 1962 and 1963, there was quite an  active\r\n\r\nprogramme  of building rural community centres,  and  we\r\n\r\nlaid down as the minimum criterion that unless there are\r\n\r\nat  least  200  families, then  we  would  not  consider\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  community centre.

These workers worked in the factory premises of\r\n\r\nHup  Seng  and  Company in the manufacture of  bee-hoon.\r\n\r\nAmongst them they had their own head, a man named Low Ah\r\n\r\nSeng.  They  worked on a tonnage basis of $6 per  picul.\r\n\r\nThe   system  appeared  to  be  that  all  the   workmen\r\n\r\ncollectively participated in manufacturing the  bee-hoon\r\n\r\nand  then  shared the earnings equally among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe  factory premises and the equipment belonged to  Hup\r\n\r\nSeng  and  Company, and the rice for the manufacture  of\r\n\r\nbee-boon  was supplied by the Company. The workmen  made\r\n\r\nthe  bee-hoon in their own time. They were not under the\r\n\r\ndirect  supervision of the Company. In fact,  they  were\r\n\r\nwhat is normally termed \"independent contractors\". There\r\n\r\nwas  no  written agreement between the Company  and  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  The  Company had never paid Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund contributions in respect of any of them. The C.P.F.\r\n\r\nBoard  had investigated into this matter in August  1964\r\n\r\nand  was satisfied that the Company was not an employer.\r\n\r\nThese  arrangements had been going on for some ten years\r\n\r\nuntil  September 1964, when a Communist-dominated union,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Commercial Houses and Factory  Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion,  came into the picture. It created a dispute  out\r\n\r\nof  a  case where the Company was reported to have  told\r\n\r\none  worker  to  stop  work. There were  two  unfruitful\r\n\r\nmeetings   in  my  Ministry.  The  Company  refused   to\r\n\r\nnegotiate with the Union on the ground that the  Company\r\n\r\nwas  not  the employer. This led to a strike in  October\r\n\r\n1964.  The Union, on the advice of their learned lawyer,\r\n\r\nMr  T.  T. Rajah, tried to force the case in the Labour\r\n\r\nCourt.

Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  yesterday I indicated  why  it  was\r\n\r\nnecessary  for us to stick to a policy of non-alignment,\r\n\r\nbecause   to  be  aligned  to  any  big  country   would\r\n\r\neventually have meant the loss of our freedom of  action\r\n\r\neven in domestic fields, because foreign policies are in\r\n\r\nfact   an  extension  of  domestic  policies  into   the\r\n\r\ninternational field. And therefore I said that  was  why\r\n\r\nwe refused to join any anti-Communist crusade because we\r\n\r\nare non-Communist. We are socialists at home because  we\r\n\r\nbelieve that the non-Communist policy is the best way of\r\n\r\ndealing  with  our  domestic  problems,  including   the\r\n\r\nCommunist  problem  in  Singapore.  We  cannot  be \r\n\r\nnon-Communist at home and anti-Communist abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same reason we have resisted demands that we\r\n\r\nshould  align  ourselves with the Communist  bloc.  This\r\n\r\ndemand  has in fact come from the Barisan Sosialis  for,\r\n\r\nwhen  all  their verbal disguise is removed,  what  they\r\n\r\nreally  want us to do is that we should align  ourselves\r\n\r\nwith  one  of  the  Communist blocs.  This  was  clearly\r\n\r\nrevealed  in  the  foreign  policy  motion  which   they\r\n\r\noriginally  submitted for our consideration last  August\r\n\r\nwhen,  as a test of the genuineness of our independence,\r\n\r\nthey  specified  the  countries  with  which  we  should\r\n\r\nimmediately establish diplomatic relations.  There  were\r\n\r\nonly  two countries, Peking and Jakarta. Since then they\r\n\r\nhave  amended  this  motion,  but  I  do  not  wish   to\r\n\r\nanticipate the debate to which we are looking forward in\r\n\r\nthe coming days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us then, non-alignment means avoiding\r\n\r\nentanglements  in what are essentially  power  conflicts\r\n\r\neven  though these conflicts may be wrapped up  in  such\r\n\r\nhighly moral terms as the struggle for a free world, for\r\n\r\nthe liberation of oppressed people as a struggle against\r\n\r\nCommunism,  capitalism, neo-colonialism  and  what  have\r\n\r\nyou.  We are intelligent and hard-headed enough to  know\r\n\r\nthat  these fine slogans are merely cloaks to cover  big\r\n\r\npower  national  interests, and  these  are  not  always\r\n\r\nidentical  with ours. To align ourselves  with  any  one\r\n\r\npower bloc is to add to its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npotential  strength. And having regard to the  strategic\r\n\r\nvalue  of Singapore, we will he adding decisive strength\r\n\r\nto one side. This, far from contributing to stability in\r\n\r\nthis area, will do just the opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all this, 1 think it is in the real\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  big powers themselves  to  see  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is non-aligned. If the big powers are  really\r\n\r\ninterested  in  averting a major conflict in  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia,  they  should  accept and ensure  the  non-aligned\r\n\r\nstatus   of  Singapore.  Since  Singapore  is  genuinely\r\n\r\nconvinced  that a non-aligned policy is the correct  one\r\n\r\nfor itself and for the peace of South-East Asia, a major\r\n\r\npower  need  not  fear  that the strategic  position  of\r\n\r\nSingapore would he exploited to its disadvantage by  one\r\n\r\nof its rivals. Our policy will be to ensure, to the best\r\n\r\nof  our ability, that Singapore remains the still centre\r\n\r\nin the power storm raging in South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, non-alignment does not mean indifference on\r\n\r\nour  part  to the real issues of peace and war  in  this\r\n\r\nregion  or even feigning blindness as to what  is  right\r\n\r\nand  wrong.  A  non-aligned policy, in  fact,  gives  us\r\n\r\ngreater  freedom to make pronouncements or adopt  stands\r\n\r\npurely  on  the  merits,  as we see  them,  of  specific\r\n\r\ninternational issues. An aligned position on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand obliges us automatically to take the stand that our\r\n\r\nmajor  and  more  powerful ally takes on  any  important\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is inevitable that Singapore's stand in specific\r\n\r\ninternational  issues  will  he  coloured   heavily   by\r\n\r\nnational  interests. The promotion of national interests\r\n\r\nis  the  essence of the foreign policy of all countries,\r\n\r\nbig  and  small. Only a country aligned to a big  power,\r\n\r\nwhether  as a colony or as an ally, may he compelled  to\r\n\r\nsacrifice  its  national interests where these  conflict\r\n\r\nwith those of its major partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the pursuit of national interests cannot be\r\n\r\nabsolute   in  a  world  where  the  fact  of   national\r\n\r\nindependence has to he balanced against the reality of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterdependence between nations. Even big  and  powerful\r\n\r\ncountries  like the United States and the  Soviet  Union\r\n\r\ncultivate  allies and friends in order to safeguard  and\r\n\r\npromote   what   they  believe  to  he  their   national\r\n\r\ninterests. Interdependence implies give and take between\r\n\r\nthe  partners involved. Interdependence cannot therefore\r\n\r\nbe  on  the  basis of unrestrained pursuit  of  national\r\n\r\ninterests  without regard to the national  interests  of\r\n\r\none's  partners and friends. There will arise  occasions\r\n\r\nwhen  we may have to make some sacrifice of our national\r\n\r\ninterests  for  the long-term interests of  the  nation.\r\n\r\nThis  need  not give rise to insurmountable difficulties\r\n\r\nif  there  is  broad  coincidence of views  between  the\r\n\r\npartners as to their ultimate national interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, our ultimate national\r\n\r\ninterests  are the preservation of the essential  values\r\n\r\non   which  our  society  is  founded.  We  believe   in\r\n\r\ndemocracy. We believe in the establishment of  a  \r\n\r\nmulti-racial  non-communal society. As Socialists, we  believe\r\n\r\nin  the  eradication of poverty, ignorance, disease  and\r\n\r\nother forms of economic and social injustice. We believe\r\n\r\nin  \"a more just and more equal society\", a slogan which\r\n\r\ndoes   not   always  give  reassurance  to  some   other\r\n\r\ncountries.  We  believe in peace between nations  simply\r\n\r\nbecause we have nothing to gain by war and, in any case,\r\n\r\nwe have not the capacity or the resources to make war on\r\n\r\nothers We covet no people's territory. We have no desire\r\n\r\nto  save  other peoples by interfering in their affairs.\r\n\r\nThey must save themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then are the elements which constitute our\r\n\r\nnational  interests, out of which our national interests\r\n\r\nare compounded. These, I submit, in no way conflict with\r\n\r\nthe   national   interests  of  those  countries   which\r\n\r\ngenuinely want to live in peace with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If other countries understand that these constitute\r\n\r\nour  national  interests and that  the  preservation  of\r\n\r\nthese  are  the  only objectives of our foreign  policy,\r\n\r\nthen they will put a kinder construction on many of  the\r\n\r\nthings that we do, including the existence of a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish  base in Singapore, unlike the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwho put a different construction on the existence of our\r\n\r\nbase. In the light of what I have said so far and in the\r\n\r\nlight  of  what  are our true national  objectives,  the\r\n\r\nbases  are  here  not for any aggressive or  imperialist\r\n\r\npurposes   but   for  the  defence  of   Singapore   and\r\n\r\nSingapore's national interests. We are realistic  enough\r\n\r\nto  recognise the limits to our capacity to be  able  to\r\n\r\ndefend ourselves against external threats. We shall,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  build  our own defence forces  to  the  fullest\r\n\r\nextent we are capable of. But what we are interested  in\r\n\r\nis  the  defence of Singapore in the context of a  major\r\n\r\nconflict   in   regard  to  major  and   more   powerful\r\n\r\nneighbours. We are in no position to build or finance an\r\n\r\narmy  capable  of defending Singapore in a  conflict  of\r\n\r\nthis kind. Even big powers with far greater resources of\r\n\r\nmoney, men and material plan their defence on the  basis\r\n\r\nof  friends and allies. That goes for the Soviet  Union.\r\n\r\nThat  goes even for the United States. So it  is  sheer\r\n\r\nmadness  for  certain  people  in  Singapore,  like  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, to advocate that Singapore should  be\r\n\r\nself-sufficient  in regard to defence. But  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis know that self-sufficiency in defence is merely\r\n\r\nanother  way of leaving Singapore defenceless, and  that\r\n\r\nis what they really want. They know that their prospects\r\n\r\nof   capturing  power  by  constitutional  and  even  by\r\n\r\nunconstitutional  means  are pretty  dim  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore, their only hope of seizing power  is  by  the\r\n\r\narrival  of  rescue  parties from outside  Singapore.  A\r\n\r\ndefenceless Singapore is therefore their dream and  hope\r\n\r\nand  the objective of their foreign policy. Getting  rid\r\n\r\nof British bases, they well know, does not mean no bases\r\n\r\nat  all  in Singapore. Even if the British were to  quit\r\n\r\nthe   base,  the  strategic  value  of  Singapore  still\r\n\r\nremains. Many countries outside of Singapore know  this.\r\n\r\nWhat is likely to happen if the British were to pull out\r\n\r\nis  that  there  will be a scramble by other  militarily\r\n\r\nmore powerful countries to get control over the base  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  such  a scramble  of  elephants,  it  is\r\n\r\nSingapore  which  is  going to  be  trampled  to  death.\r\n\r\nBecause of this,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  would  like the British base to be here  until  such\r\n\r\ntime  as  we  can  find other more  effective  and  more\r\n\r\npractical  ways of ensuring our defence. For one  thing,\r\n\r\nthe  British base is already here and it has  been  here\r\n\r\nfor  decades.  So there is no question of  any  scramble\r\n\r\nstarting for possession to control the base, which there\r\n\r\nmust  be  if  the British were to quit it. However,  now\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore is a sovereign and independent  country,\r\n\r\nwe  can  take  steps  to  make it  clear  to  those  who\r\n\r\ngenuinely fear that the base is an imperialist base  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  a base for aggression against  them,  that\r\n\r\ntheir  fears  are  unfounded. We have  no  intention  of\r\n\r\nallowing the base to be used for aggressive or so-called\r\n\r\nneo-colonialist ends, simply because it is  not  in  our\r\n\r\nnational  interest  to  encourage  aggression  or  \r\n\r\nneo-colonialism. This assurance is a firm one and it can  be\r\n\r\nan  effective one. Because, as you know, Sir,  the  base\r\n\r\ncannot  in a sovereign country be effectively  used  for\r\n\r\npurposes which the Singapore Government believes  to  be\r\n\r\nagainst  the national interest. We all know that without\r\n\r\nthe  goodwill  and  support of  the  government  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  in which the base is, a modern base  cannot  be\r\n\r\noperated  effectively, if at all it can be operated.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, those who have designs of their own on Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  persist  in  believing that the  base  is  a  \r\n\r\nneo-colonialist  threat.  There is  nothing  we  can  do  to\r\n\r\npersuade them otherwise except not to be needled by such\r\n\r\ncharges  into abandoning such arrangement  as  we  think\r\n\r\nnecessary for our defence for our national interest. Our\r\n\r\nresponsibility is not to any outside country but to  the\r\n\r\ntwo  million people who have entrusted their welfare and\r\n\r\nsafety  to  us, and we will ensure their safety  by  the\r\n\r\nmost  practical  and most effective means  we  think  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to secure their defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been independent for just under five\r\n\r\nmonths and our foreign policy, though still rough  about\r\n\r\nthe edges, has won regard as well as friends for us. The\r\n\r\nessential thing is that we have not been isolated as the\r\n\r\nlocal  Communists and others who are not Communists  had\r\n\r\nhoped we would be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere  are  people,  Communists and non-Communists,  who\r\n\r\nthought  that  Singapore, by  the  manner  in  which  it\r\n\r\nachieved   independence,  by  openly   proclaiming   its\r\n\r\nintentions  that the base would remain, would  never  be\r\n\r\naccepted  by  the  Afro-Asian  countries  as   a   truly\r\n\r\nsovereign  and independent country. Sir, though  we  are\r\n\r\nnew  to  foreign  policy,  it  is  the  measure  of  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of our foreign policy that  we  have  been\r\n\r\naccepted as a sovereign independent country despite  the\r\n\r\nBritish  bases  by  nonaligned countries,  and  even  by\r\n\r\nCommunist  countries.  Therefore,  it  is  not   a   bad\r\n\r\nbeginning for our foreign policy. It only underlines the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of our foreign policy. We have made a good\r\n\r\nstart.  We  have made a start in the right direction  by\r\n\r\nadhering  to  a  non-aligned  policy.  The  process   of\r\n\r\nconsolidating the friendly relations we have established\r\n\r\nwith foreign countries will take time and money. It  may\r\n\r\nnot  be feasible to establish missions in every friendly\r\n\r\ncountry because we cannot mobilise the personnel and the\r\n\r\nmoney  to  do  this. So friendly contacts  with  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries will have to be maintaned and consolidated, in\r\n\r\nsome  cases,  by  establishing  overseas  missions.   In\r\n\r\nothers,  by  official visits and,  for  the  most  part,\r\n\r\nbecause there are 116 nations, by working together  with\r\n\r\nall countries in the United Nations to help build a more\r\n\r\npeaceful and more prosperous world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is our intention first to establish\r\n\r\nmissions   in   some  ten  countries.   These   are   in\r\n\r\nalphabetical  order: Australia, Burma, Cambodia,  India,\r\n\r\nJapan,  New  Zealand, Thailand, the U.A.R.,  the  United\r\n\r\nStates and the United Kingdom. These will be, as I said,\r\n\r\nthe first of our overseas missions and we hope to set up\r\n\r\nmost,  if  not  all, of them during the  course  of  the\r\n\r\ncoming year. They will of necessity be initially  on  an\r\n\r\nausterity basis. There may be some countries where there\r\n\r\nwill  he  just  the  Ambassador  and  nobody  else.  But\r\n\r\nwhatever it is, we have to make a start, and this  is  a\r\n\r\nstart.  With  some  of  these countries,  we  have  very\r\n\r\nsubstantial and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclose   trade   relations.  With  others,  identity   of\r\n\r\npolitical  interest and aims counts for more than  trade\r\n\r\ninterests.  And  with  the  rest,  trade  and  political\r\n\r\ninterests happen to be equally important. These are,  as\r\n\r\nI  said,  Sir,  the first of our overseas  missions.  We\r\n\r\nshall  set up others when we can find the personnel  and\r\n\r\nthe  money  or  when political and trade  considerations\r\n\r\njustify  their  being set up earlier. The  promotion  of\r\n\r\ntrade with as many countries as possible will he a major\r\n\r\nobjective of foreign policy I should like to state  here\r\n\r\nthat  ideological differences will not be made  barriers\r\n\r\nto  trade  between  us  and other  countries.  The  only\r\n\r\ncriterion  for  trade  is  whether  trade  with  another\r\n\r\ncountry  is in our economic interest, because  promotion\r\n\r\nof  our  economic interest is promotion of our  national\r\n\r\ninterest.  There  may,  of  course,  be  occasions  when\r\n\r\neconomic   interests  may  have  to  be  sacrificed   to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  some important political interests the  total\r\n\r\nban  on trade with Rhodesia recently is a case in point.\r\n\r\nBut,  generally  speaking, ideological differences  will\r\n\r\nnot  he made obstacles to trade, i.e., legitimate trade.\r\n\r\nWe  shall take care to see that trade does not become  a\r\n\r\ncover  for  political  manipulations,  interference   or\r\n\r\nattempts to control us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of trade brings us to the most important\r\n\r\naspect  of  our  foreign  policy,  our  relations   with\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  I  have  kept this to the  last  because  our\r\n\r\nrelationship  with  Malaysia is of  a  special  kind.  I\r\n\r\nconfess, Mr Speaker, that I find it difficult to keep a\r\n\r\nstraight face in talking about a foreign policy  towards\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  There  is  something  unreal  and  odd  about\r\n\r\nlumping   our  relations  with  Malaysia  under  foreign\r\n\r\nrelations. But then some rather odd things do happen  in\r\n\r\nthe  history of peoples and countries. All that  we  can\r\n\r\nthen do is to accept the oddity as something not of  our\r\n\r\nmaking  and  try  to make the best of an odd  situation.\r\n\r\nBecause  the situation is odd., we should be  more  than\r\n\r\nusually  careful  to  devise  rational  and  intelligent\r\n\r\npolicies  in  regard to Malaysia. In  theory,  i.e.,  in\r\n\r\nregard to the Constitution, the relationship between  us\r\n\r\nand Malaysia comes under the category of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforeign  relations.  So we set up a High  Commission  as\r\n\r\npart  of  the necessary formalities between two  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries, and the machinery functioned efficiently when\r\n\r\non  occasions the two Commissions had to exchange formal\r\n\r\ndiplomatic protest notes. However, constitutional  forms\r\n\r\nare  one thing and the hard facts of history, geography,\r\n\r\neconomics and demography are another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these latter factors underline not the\r\n\r\nseparateness or foreignness of the two territories,  but\r\n\r\nthe  oneness of the people in the two countries.  People\r\n\r\non  both sides of the Causeway have not since 9th August\r\n\r\neven begun to treat one another as foreigners. And I  do\r\n\r\nnot think they ever will. This is a hard fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may be permitted a personal note. I have my\r\n\r\nparents  and a brother in Malaysia. Though I have  tried\r\n\r\nvery  hard  to  keep  up  with  the  appropriate  spirit\r\n\r\ndemanded  by the Constitution, I could not bring  myself\r\n\r\nto  regard them as foreigners. I am quite sure this goes\r\n\r\nfor  hundreds of thousands like me on both sides of  the\r\n\r\nCauseway. So one cannot talk of a foreign policy towards\r\n\r\nMalaysia  in  the same sense as we would  in  regard  to\r\n\r\nother  countries.  It  must be a  foreign  policy  of  a\r\n\r\nspecial kind, a foreign policy towards a country  which,\r\n\r\nthough constitutionally foreign, is essentially one with\r\n\r\nus and which, when logic and sanity reassert themselves,\r\n\r\nmust  once more become one. It must be a foreign  policy\r\n\r\nbased on the realisation that Singapore and Malaysia are\r\n\r\nreally  two arms of one politically organic whole,  each\r\n\r\nof  which  has,  through a constitutional  proclamation,\r\n\r\nbeen  declared separate and independent. True a Minister\r\n\r\nin Malaysia not so long ago did say that on 9th August a\r\n\r\ndiseased  arm was cut off. I do not think that  anything\r\n\r\nwas  cut  off,  in  fact, fortunately  for  us.  I  say,\r\n\r\nfortunately,  because if one of the arms is  really  cut\r\n\r\noff,  it  must result in the whole organism bleeding  to\r\n\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our foreign policy is based on an awareness of not so\r\n\r\nmuch the constitutional fact as the fact of what is real\r\n\r\n-  the  reality of the thing. The survival and \r\n\r\nwell-being of Malaysia is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nessential  to  Singapore's  survival.  Conversely,   the\r\n\r\nsurvival  and  well-being of Singapore is  essential  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia's survival. We should not, however, confuse the\r\n\r\nsurvival of the peoples in the two territories with  the\r\n\r\nsurvival  of governments and political parties,  because\r\n\r\npolitical  parties and governments come and go,  as  the\r\n\r\nmood  and  aspirations  of peoples  change  and  as  the\r\n\r\npolitical environment changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this broader background in mind, we in Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  to  accept the fact that we and Malaysia  are  two\r\n\r\nsovereign States compelled to move, by different routes,\r\n\r\ntowards  the  ultimate destiny of  one  people  and  one\r\n\r\ncountry.  We have chosen our route towards this ultimate\r\n\r\ndestiny even if we have to do so, now, as an independent\r\n\r\nand sovereign State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one way, Sir, this may not be a bad thing because\r\n\r\nwe have the freedom now to choose our route towards this\r\n\r\nultimate and inevitable goal. We live the way we want to\r\n\r\nlive,  the  most effective way. I believe, Sir,  victory\r\n\r\ngoes  to  the one who chooses the route and successfully\r\n\r\nreaches the goal set for it by destiny. When we were  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia, we chose the route of a Malaysian Malaysia  as\r\n\r\nour  objective,  and that resulted in many  difficulties\r\n\r\nand ultimately in our receiving a quit order or else. We\r\n\r\nwere  told  never to darken Malaysia's  door,  and  they\r\n\r\nexhorted us to set up house on our own elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, so be it. We are now an independent State. True\r\n\r\nit is no longer within our power to help in the building\r\n\r\nof  a Malaysian Malaysia. But it is within our power and\r\n\r\nwithin our rights to build what I would call a Malaysian\r\n\r\nSingapore - not a Singaporean Singapore but  a  Malaysian\r\n\r\nSingapore. The essence of a Malaysian Malaysia was  that\r\n\r\nit   was  possible  to  build  a  just,  prosperous  and\r\n\r\nprogressive nation in a multi-racial society only on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  a  non-communal and a non-racial approach  in\r\n\r\npolicies  and  in economics. When we were  in  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthis  thesis  was  rejected as not only impractical  but\r\n\r\nalso dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So since 9th August we have had the opportunity and\r\n\r\nthe freedom to show in Singapore that such a society for\r\n\r\nwhich  we struggled in Malaysia can be made to  work  in\r\n\r\nSingapore;  that a multi-racial society founded  on  the\r\n\r\nconcepts  of  democracy, social equality  and  socialist\r\n\r\nconcepts of economic and social justice is the only safe\r\n\r\nand  practical  way  of building  a  united  nation,  of\r\n\r\nbuilding a nation out of many races, and of solving  the\r\n\r\neconomic and social problems of peoples of all races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the time being, all we ask of our neighbour in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  that having insisted that we should  be  a\r\n\r\nsovereign  State, they should treat us  as  a  sovereign\r\n\r\nState  and  allow us the rights and privileges  that  go\r\n\r\nwith  sovereignty, because we concede to them the  right\r\n\r\nto  behave like a sovereign State. We are resentful when\r\n\r\nthey  behave towards us as though Singapore is  still  a\r\n\r\nState within Malaysia. And Malaysia can be assured  that\r\n\r\nwe  will  not use our sovereignty in such a  way  as  to\r\n\r\njeopardise their interests - their genuine and  ultimate\r\n\r\ninterests - because we are well aware that we have  a\r\n\r\nvital  stake in the well-being and security of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  do them in because eventually  we  would  he\r\n\r\ndoing ourselves in. Malaysia is for us a sovereign State\r\n\r\nbut not a foreign country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall always bear this in mind in our relations\r\n\r\nwith  them.  All we ask is that they should  reciprocate\r\n\r\nthis attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall have more to say about the particular\r\n\r\naspects of our foreign policy when we come to debate the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis' amended motion on foreign policy. I do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to anticipate the motion or their  return  to\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber. All I wish to point out now is  that  the\r\n\r\ncourse of a foreign policy is never smooth. It is  never\r\n\r\na  straight  line  between two  points.  There  must  he\r\n\r\nchanges,  of  course,  as  the  international  landscape\r\n\r\nchanges. The fact that the Barisan Sosialis had to amend\r\n\r\ntheir  motion  within  a period of  a  few  months  only\r\n\r\nunderlines my point that the world, and particularly our\r\n\r\npart of the world,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  changing  rapidly,  and a  foreign  policy  must  be\r\n\r\nflexible enough to meet these changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragic weakness of the Barisan Sosialis - that is,\r\n\r\ntragic for them but good for us - is that the more  the\r\n\r\nworld changes the more they remain the same old hunch of\r\n\r\ntenderfoot Marxists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Devan Nair</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, with\r\n\r\nregard  to  the Motion of Thanks to the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  for  his  Address, I wish first  to  express  my\r\n\r\nthanks for being granted this opportunity to participate\r\n\r\nin this debate. The policy speech of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara is giving confidence and hope to everyone.  I  am\r\n\r\nalso  pleased with that speech. At this juncture, I wish\r\n\r\nto give some of my views to this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all our citizens should be given\r\n\r\nadequate  employment opportunities. That  is  our  basic\r\n\r\ntask.  The employment exchange is not functioning  well.\r\n\r\nThat is what I have gathered. There are some people  who\r\n\r\nhave  registered with the employment exchange  for  many\r\n\r\nyears,  but  they  have not been able to  get  any  job.\r\n\r\nHowever, those who have newly registered have been  able\r\n\r\nto  get  jobs. I hope the Minister for Labour will  look\r\n\r\ninto this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our nation has four official\r\n\r\nlanguages. All of them have the same official status. It\r\n\r\nis  remarkable and praiseworthy that all of them  should\r\n\r\nbe  given  equal status. We do not have  the  policy  of\r\n\r\nhaving one language, one religion and one race. We  have\r\n\r\nquite  clearly declared our policy. Democrats  who  have\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the people at heart should accept  this\r\n\r\nobjective.  This policy of multi-lingualism is  accepted\r\n\r\nwith much pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture when we are practising multi-lingualism in our society, I should mention one\r\n\r\nimportant  matter. There have been some defects  in  the\r\n\r\nworking out of this system. The Tamil language is  being\r\n\r\nvery  adversely affected. It is my duty  to  point  this\r\n\r\nout. Notice boards at Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffices are written in all the four languages. But there\r\n\r\nare  too  many errors in the Tamil language version.  In\r\n\r\nsome  places there are only three languages.  Tamil  has\r\n\r\nbeen  omitted. In some Ministries there are  not  enough\r\n\r\nofficers  in certain departments for the Tamil  section.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the sections do not function well. I hope the\r\n\r\ndepartments concerned will take adequate steps to remedy\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamil is used in the Tamil secondary schools. However,\r\n\r\nthere  are  no opportunities for these students  in  the\r\n\r\nsecondary schools to continue with their education. They\r\n\r\nhave  no  means  to continue with their  education  even\r\n\r\nthough  they may have the desire to do so. Opportunities\r\n\r\nand   facilities  should  be  made  available  for  such\r\n\r\nstudents.  I  feel there is a shortage  of  teachers.  I\r\n\r\nappreciate that. There is the Teachers' Training College\r\n\r\nto  train  teachers. Even though there are Tamil-trained\r\n\r\nmen  in  the  College,  not enough graduates  are  being\r\n\r\nproduced. I feel that immediate steps should be taken to\r\n\r\nrectify  this situation. Those who have passed well  and\r\n\r\nwith  credit  in the secondary schools should  be  given\r\n\r\nbursaries.  They  should be sent  to  India  for  higher\r\n\r\neducation.  On  their return in a few years'  time,  the\r\n\r\npressing  shortage  of  trained  staff  will  be  eased.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,  officers on contract could be  brought  from\r\n\r\nIndia.  They  can be appointed for teaching appointments\r\n\r\nat  the  Teachers' Training College. In this connection,\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education should take adequate steps  to\r\n\r\nimplement this proposal. I would request them to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy of the Government to\r\n\r\nprotect   the  interests  of  the  minorities  is   most\r\n\r\ngratifying. The minorities will have full confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish to point out one fact. In any\r\n\r\ndemocratic  society  Opposition  Members  should  always\r\n\r\nbring  up  any  points on which they disagree,  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse. They may even walk out if they wish to do so. But\r\n\r\nour  Barisan Opposition Members have chosen  to  boycott\r\n\r\nthis  Session altogether. This shows that they  have  no\r\n\r\nfaith in the democratic system.

During the latter part\r\n\r\nof   this  period  Singapore  became  a  State  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaysia, as a result of which many of our\r\n\r\nlaws  were either amended or repealed, and many  Federal\r\n\r\nlaws were extended here. On the 9th of August this year.\r\n\r\nSingapore became separate from Malaysia, and though  the\r\n\r\nSeparation  Agreement makes provision  for  all  present\r\n\r\nlaws  in Singapore in force immediately before Singapore\r\n\r\nDay to continue to have effect according to their tenor,\r\n\r\nsome of these laws will now have to be changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publication of the new edition of our laws at the\r\n\r\nearliest  possible  moment has now become  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nnecessity  and  some urgency. The work of reviewing  all\r\n\r\nexisting  legislation  with the object  of  making  such\r\n\r\nmodifications  as are necessary to bring the  laws  into\r\n\r\nconformity  with  Singapore's status as  an  independent\r\n\r\nRepublic,  as  well as fusing amending legislation  with\r\n\r\nprincipal   legislation,   would   constitute   a   real\r\n\r\ncontribution to those who have to find their  way  about\r\n\r\nour  laws.  To read the law as it is at present  is  now\r\n\r\noften  a  tiresome task, involving references to several\r\n\r\nbooks or documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government, therefore, intend\r\n\r\nshortly to introduce in Parliament a Bill to provide for\r\n\r\nthe  appointment of a Law Revision Commission whose task\r\n\r\nwill be to prepare and publish a Revised Edition of  our\r\n\r\nlaws.  This will afford us an opportunity to take  stock\r\n\r\nof our legislation by briefly surveying our laws as they\r\n\r\nexisted  from  the days of the Straits  Settlements  and\r\n\r\nthrough the period when Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nformed  part  of  Malaysia to the present  day  with  an\r\n\r\nindication of law revision plans for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government of the Straits Settlements Act,\r\n\r\n1866, was brought into force in 1867 by an Order of  the\r\n\r\nQueen-in-Council, certain islands and territories  which\r\n\r\nwere  previously  under the East India  Company  jointly\r\n\r\nbecame   a   separate  colony  known  as   the   Straits\r\n\r\nSettlements.  The  first  meeting  of  the   Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil was held on the 1st of April, 1867, when certain\r\n\r\nlaws  were passed. And in the following year was enacted\r\n\r\nthe  interpretation (Amendment) Ordinance,  1868,  which\r\n\r\nprovides  that  the legislation of the Colony  shall  be\r\n\r\ncalled  Ordinances. The Ordinances of  the  Colony  were\r\n\r\nreprinted by Government in two volumes in 1886 and again\r\n\r\nin  1898. In 1910 a thorough revision of the whole  body\r\n\r\nof  written law was begun, and a Commission appointed to\r\n\r\nprepare a new and revised edition of the Statute Laws of\r\n\r\nthe  Colony.  The  new edition, which was  published  in\r\n\r\n1920, dealt with all legislation from 1835 to the end of\r\n\r\n1919 exclusive of war and emergency legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Revision of the laws of the Colony was\r\n\r\npublished  in 1926 and contained the law's  enforced  on\r\n\r\nthe 31st of December, 1925. The Third Revision, the 1936\r\n\r\nEdition, was prepared under the authority of the Revised\r\n\r\nEdition  of the Laws Ordinance, 1935, and contained  the\r\n\r\nOrdinances  amended to 31st December, 1935. The  current\r\n\r\nedition  of the laws of Singapore, which run into  eight\r\n\r\nvolumes, was brought into force from the 1st July, 1956,\r\n\r\nand  annual supplements for the years 1956 to 1962  were\r\n\r\nsubsequently  issued. This then, Mr  Speaker,  was  the\r\n\r\nposition prior to Malaysia Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could have been said that whilst the laws were not\r\n\r\navailable in one set of volumes, they could at least  be\r\n\r\nascertained   with   reasonable  diligence   and   care.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with the coming of Malaysia, the position\r\n\r\nwas  worsened and it has become more and more  difficult\r\n\r\nto   ascertain   the  law  through  the   multitude   of\r\n\r\nModification Orders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissued  mainly  in Kuala Lumpur, but also in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  the various amending Acts and Ordinances that  have\r\n\r\nbeen enacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysia Act, as well as the Constitution of the\r\n\r\nState  of Singapore, provided for the continuity of  all\r\n\r\nlaws  which  were in force or which had been passed  but\r\n\r\nnot  brought into force before Malaysia Day.  After  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of Malaysia on 16th September, 1963,  laws\r\n\r\nwhich  could not be enacted by the Singapore Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly in so far as they were laws which could not  be\r\n\r\npassed after Malaysia Day by the State Legislature, were\r\n\r\ntreated  as Federal laws by virtue of the provisions  of\r\n\r\nsection   73   of   the  Malaysia  Act.  The   Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment, acting under powers given under  section  74\r\n\r\nof  the  Malaysia  Act,  made  amendments  by  means  of\r\n\r\nModification Orders to such of the laws of Singapore  as\r\n\r\nwere  treated as Federal laws. In the same manner,  laws\r\n\r\nwhich  before the 16th September. 1963, had  application\r\n\r\nonly  to the States of Malaya were extended to apply  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  with or without amendments. Certain Singapore\r\n\r\nlaw's  which  were  treated as Federal  laws  were  also\r\n\r\nrepealed by such Modification Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government, in exercise of powers under\r\n\r\nArticle  105  of  the  Constitution  of  the  State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   made  consequential  amendments   to   such\r\n\r\nSingapore  laws as were treated as State laws  to  bring\r\n\r\nthem  into  conformity  with  Singapore's  status  as  a\r\n\r\ncomponent part of the Federation of Malaysia.  The  laws\r\n\r\nenacted  by  the  Malaysian Parliament  up  to  the  8th\r\n\r\nAugust.  1965, which had application to Singapore,  also\r\n\r\nform part of the laws of Singapore at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the result of all these changes and\r\n\r\nmanipulations is that our laws are by no means as  clear\r\n\r\nor  as  easily ascertainable as they should  be.  It  is\r\n\r\ninevitable that mistakes are being made not only by  the\r\n\r\nadministration  but  even by trained  lawyers;  and  the\r\n\r\nlayman  has  every reason to complain that  the  law  is\r\n\r\nveritably an ass.

The  Bill also provides that  the  President\r\n\r\nmay,  by Order made any time during the period of three\r\n\r\nyears  after  the  Act  comes  into  force,  make  such\r\n\r\nmodifications  in  any written  law  as  appear  to  he\r\n\r\nnecessary  or expedient as a result of the  passing  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  and  in  consequence of the  independence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore upon separation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term \"modification\" in this context includes\r\n\r\namendments, adaptations and repeals, and in relation  to\r\n\r\nany  law  of Malaysia or of the United Kingdom  for  the\r\n\r\ntime  being  in  force in Singapore, includes  power  to\r\n\r\ndeclare that such law shall cease to apply to Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  anticipation of the enactment of this provision, the\r\n\r\nState  Advocate-General has already commenced  preparing\r\n\r\nModification Orders to restore the laws to the  position\r\n\r\nin which they were before Malaysia. These Orders cannot,\r\n\r\nof  course,  be  published until after the  Independence\r\n\r\nBill has been enacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to facilitate the reading\r\n\r\nof  the laws modified during the Malaysian period and in\r\n\r\nconsequence  of our Independence Act, it is proposed  to\r\n\r\npublish reprints of such laws incorporating not only all\r\n\r\nsuch  modifications but also all amendments made to them\r\n\r\nwhether before during, or after the Malaysia period,  so\r\n\r\nthat  any  reprinted  legislation  may  be  read  as   a\r\n\r\nconnected  whole without reference to several  books  or\r\n\r\ndocuments.  The  Interpretation Bill provides  for  such\r\n\r\nreprints, and many of these reprints will form the basis\r\n\r\nof  the  next Revised Edition of the laws of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nprovision for the preparation and publication  of  which\r\n\r\nwill be made in the Revised Edition of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Law's  Bill.

It is for this reason,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the  publication of every Modification Order  made\r\n\r\nunder  the  Republic of Singapore Act is to be  followed\r\n\r\nshortly,  after  by  a  reprint of  the  legislation  in\r\n\r\nquestion.  These reprints will form the prelude  to  the\r\n\r\nRevised  Edition  of  the laws,  and  when  the  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition  is  completed.  Singapore  will  have  a \r\n\r\nself-contained consolidated compendium of all statutes. It is\r\n\r\nthe  Government's intention, as stated in the speech  of\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, to set up  a\r\n\r\nConstitutional  Commission to  consider  the  safeguards\r\n\r\nwhich  should be inserted in the Constitution to protect\r\n\r\nthe  rights of minorities and to ensure that the  rights\r\n\r\nof  all citizens shall be equal not only in law but also\r\n\r\nin   practice.   Pending  the  deliberations   and   the\r\n\r\nconclusions  of  this Constitutional Commission,  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed  that  the  provisions of the  Constitution  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  of  the  Malaysian  Constitution   shall\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  apply  in  Singapore  subject   to   such\r\n\r\nmodifications,   omissions,  and   amendments   as   are\r\n\r\nnecessitated by the independent status of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nits  ceasing  to  be a part of Malaysia.

As an independent  nation\r\n\r\nin  the world, we are laced with some common problems in\r\n\r\nlife,  and  one of the problems is that we must  try  to\r\n\r\nsolve  our economic problem which represents two schools\r\n\r\nof political philosophy. Mr Speaker, whether our people\r\n\r\nwill  have any well-being economically, can well he seen\r\n\r\nfrom the non-Communist democratic socialist policies  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  The experience in  implementing  these\r\n\r\npolicies  is that the well-being of the people must  not\r\n\r\nhe sacrificed on the altar of a totalitarian government.\r\n\r\nThat  means their personal freedom and political freedom\r\n\r\nmust  not  he  sacrificed. In fact, whether politica1ly,\r\n\r\nculturally or religiously, the people must be allowed to\r\n\r\nprogress in all respects. This means that the future  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  must of necessity depend on the  manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich the people try to solve their economic problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to crave your indulgence to\r\n\r\nspeak  with  some  certainty that  in  an  ever-changing\r\n\r\ndeveloping     country    and    society,     obstinacy,\r\n\r\ntotalitarianism  and feudalism are  some  factors  which\r\n\r\nwill  arrest the progress of our society and will hinder\r\n\r\nour endeavour to solve our own economic problems. So the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which we try to solve our economic problems,\r\n\r\nin  fact, is a reflection of the soundness of bankruptcy\r\n\r\nof  our political and economic system. Talking about the\r\n\r\nconcrete contents of our political ideology, we can  see\r\n\r\nvery  clearly what kind of political line we are  taking\r\n\r\nthrough our foreign policy and political contentions. On\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, we can also see our own political stand\r\n\r\nfrom  the reflection and reception given to our  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy. These facts are very concrete and I believe many\r\n\r\nof us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  already  been acquainted with them and  I  do  not\r\n\r\ntherefore wish to spend any more time in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, please allow me to speak as a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of the people and, in this  capacity.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to speak with some clarity and frankness  on\r\n\r\nour economic future. I hope that by so doing I shall  he\r\n\r\nable to correct the erroneous attitude and ideas of some\r\n\r\nof  the  obscurantists in their attempt  to  hinder  our\r\n\r\neconomic  progress. I do not wish to spend the  time  of\r\n\r\nthis I louse in trying to recall the dramatic experience\r\n\r\nthat  we had in achieving independence. But I would like\r\n\r\nto say that ever since we were forced to leave Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthere  have  been  some  feudalistic  rulers  who   have\r\n\r\nharboured   the   intention  to  hinder   our   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment. They are of the opinion that  by  so  doing\r\n\r\nthey   will  he  able  to  make  it  difficult  or  even\r\n\r\nimpossible  for  Singapore to survive as an  independent\r\n\r\nnation.  There are several reasons for them  to  harbour\r\n\r\nthis  idea. Firstly, they think that without  a  densely\r\n\r\npopulated market, Singapore would not be able to  strive\r\n\r\neconomically. As a matter of fact, we do not think  that\r\n\r\nour  economic foundation depends on whether  we  have  a\r\n\r\ndensely  populated market or not. This fact of a densely\r\n\r\npopulated   market  is  not  the  important  factor   to\r\n\r\ndetermine our economic progress and prosperity.  We  can\r\n\r\nsee  that  China  and India are very densely  populated.\r\n\r\nThey are, in fact, a densely populated market. But these\r\n\r\ncountries  do not enjoy a very high standard of  living.\r\n\r\nWhat  is more important is that the mere existence of  a\r\n\r\ndensely  populated market is not the determining  factor\r\n\r\nto  provide us with any economic prosperity. What is the\r\n\r\ndetermining factor then? Let me tell you. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nit is the purchasing power of the people that counts.  I\r\n\r\nwould  therefore  warn  those  ultras  and  shortsighted\r\n\r\npeople that although the people of Singapore are without\r\n\r\nnatural resources or perhaps without a densely populated\r\n\r\nmarket,  they have a higher purchasing power.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nour  own  population can be considered a kind of natural\r\n\r\nresources. These are the important factors by  which  we\r\n\r\nmay achieve prosperity and progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation is to be the base of our economic\r\n\r\nprogress. This, in fact, is a very important factor. But\r\n\r\nthat is not enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also have a very enlightened economic policy.\r\n\r\nI  believe that with a very enlightened economic policy,\r\n\r\nwe  shall  be able to make progress with our  programme.\r\n\r\nThe   maintenance  of  a  good  labour  and   management\r\n\r\nrelationship  is very important too. We  must  also  see\r\n\r\nthat   the   purchasing  power  of  our   workers,   our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  and the whole society in general,  must  be\r\n\r\nmaintained.  In  this respect, I would like  to  mention\r\n\r\nsome  aspects  dealt with in the policy  Speech  of  His\r\n\r\nExcellency.  We must make our goods competitive  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational  market. Our prices  must  be  competitive\r\n\r\nenough  to  enable  us  to  capture  some  part  of  the\r\n\r\ninternational  market  to  provide  an  outlet  for  our\r\n\r\nmanufactured goods. This, of course, will depend on  the\r\n\r\npolitical  consciousness as well as the  discipline  and\r\n\r\nefficiency  of  our  workers.  They  should  have   high\r\n\r\nefficiency  and effectiveness in their work. Given  this\r\n\r\neffectiveness  and efficiency, I am sure they  will  put\r\n\r\nforward  their  best effort so as to implement  what  is\r\n\r\nbeing stated in the policy Speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main factor of our industrialisation is a big\r\n\r\nconsumer  market. Apart from this, we should  also  have\r\n\r\ntwo  prerequisites. As stated in the policy  Speech,  we\r\n\r\nmust  establish  trade relations with all  countries  in\r\n\r\norder  to  get a share of the international market.  The\r\n\r\nonly  correct policy in our trade relations is  that  we\r\n\r\nwant  trade, not aid. Internally, people from all  walks\r\n\r\nof  life  should make a concerted effort to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nsuccess of our industrialisation and to take active  and\r\n\r\npositive  part in all economic activities.  In  view  of\r\n\r\nthis,  I  am confident that in our economic development,\r\n\r\nwe  will  be  able  to bring about a better  and  higher\r\n\r\nliving  standard  for our people. This  is  not  a  mere\r\n\r\nslogan.  I would like to make an earnest appeal  to  our\r\n\r\npeople  here  in  order to ensure our  independence  and\r\n\r\nsurvival.   Our   entrepreneurs  should   have   a   new\r\n\r\nunderstanding of their role. Mr Speaker, Sir, allow  me\r\n\r\nto say that the entrepreneurs should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  be concerned with their own interests and their own\r\n\r\ndividends only. They should also be concerned  with  the\r\n\r\noverall interests of the whole society. They should  not\r\n\r\nbe  concerned with their market and the curve  of  their\r\n\r\nproduction. They should take a similar interest  in  the\r\n\r\noverall interest of our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the economic development problem, I am glad to note\r\n\r\nthat  certain  leaders in Malaysia  have  realised  that\r\n\r\ncloser economic relations between Singapore and Malaysia\r\n\r\nis  a  necessity.  If  I  am allowed  to  quote  certain\r\n\r\nstatements made by the Malaysian leaders, 1 think I  can\r\n\r\nmake  clear  what I am going to say about  the  economic\r\n\r\nrelations   between   Singapore   and   Malaysia.   This\r\n\r\nrelationship  should  be based on  mutual  interest  and\r\n\r\nbenefit. The Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister on the 24th\r\n\r\nof  November said that the Western countries should give\r\n\r\naid to Malaysia. Otherwise, they would lose their desire\r\n\r\nfor  the democratic way of living. If they have a better\r\n\r\nliving  standard,  they  would  not  turn  to  Communist\r\n\r\ncountries   for  aid.  Similarly,  on  the  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and Malaysia, our stand  is  that  we\r\n\r\nwant  trade.  We  want to survive. If  our  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountry is not able to give us aid and, in fact, go  one\r\n\r\nstep  further to foil our attempt to increase our  trade\r\n\r\nso  that  we  can  ease  our burdens  and  difficulties,\r\n\r\ninstead of incurring a loss of trade for ourselves. This\r\n\r\nwill only create instability and chaos. This will give a\r\n\r\nvery  good  opportunity to the Communists to  wreck  our\r\n\r\ndemocratic  way of life. This is not only  a  danger  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but  it  would also be  a  danger  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries in South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when Singapore was expelled from\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  the  Malaysian  leaders  declared  that   the\r\n\r\nseparation of Singapore from Malaysia would bring  about\r\n\r\na  better understanding between the two territories.  We\r\n\r\nagree  to  what  they said. But since we  have  achieved\r\n\r\nindependence,  what  is the true  situation?  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  for regret that the Malaysian leaders  have  not\r\n\r\npractised what they have said. I have to point out  that\r\n\r\nsince Singapore is a neighbour of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  the  relationship should be  close.  Anything\r\n\r\nwhich  happens here will have repercussions in Malaysia.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should progress in a spirit of competition\r\n\r\narid  strive to achieve a common prosperity for the  two\r\n\r\nterritories by economic co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, the process of history is  relentless\r\n\r\nand  continuing. We who are here today  as  the  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of our people never  did  hope  in  our\r\n\r\nfondest  dreams  to be in this House today  to  run  the\r\n\r\naffairs  of  an independent nation. We entered  Malaysia\r\n\r\nbecause we believe in Malaysia - a re-unification  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  were artificially separated by  a  colonial\r\n\r\npower  who  saw  in  separation the  way  to  successful\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule.  Colonialism  has,  however,  historical\r\n\r\nlimitations, for the process of time wears down colonial\r\n\r\ndomination. People elsewhere have achieved freedom  from\r\n\r\ncolonialism by revolution and counter-revolution. But we\r\n\r\nin   this   part   of  South-East  Asia  have   achieved\r\n\r\nindependence  by nationalism against the colonial  power\r\n\r\nthat  knows  and understands the storms that nationalism\r\n\r\ncan evoke. Indeed, political and economic expediency saw\r\n\r\nthe  graceful withdrawal of colonialism from Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore,   and   what   we,  who   struggled   against\r\n\r\ncolonialism, achieved was a social and political  change\r\n\r\nfor the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time we felt that we had found the answer to our\r\n\r\nills in Malaysia. But history had destined otherwise for\r\n\r\nus.  Colonialism raised its ugly head with  obscurantist\r\n\r\nslogans of one race, one language and one religion,  and\r\n\r\nthe  whole structure for which we fought collapsed.  Our\r\n\r\nstand  for a nation of Malaysians, multi-racial, \r\n\r\nmulti-lingual  and multi-religious, foundered on the  base  of\r\n\r\nracial  fanaticism and we were forced out of a  national\r\n\r\nentity  which we sincerely helped to create and nurture.\r\n\r\nWhat we were forced ho accept we have accepted. And  now\r\n\r\nit  is  for us to show all concerned that we can  travel\r\n\r\nthe road of independence under our own steam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand overcome all difficulties. Indeed, we have travelled\r\n\r\na  long  and arduous road. We have overcome colonialism.\r\n\r\nWe  have exposed and isolated the anti-national elements\r\n\r\nand  we  have  shown the communalists that we  will  not\r\n\r\nstand any nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent Singapore is confident of building a\r\n\r\ntolerant multi-racial nation which will be the pride  of\r\n\r\nAsia  and the world. We are sure that our experience  in\r\n\r\ntolerant  multi-racial unity will find its echo  in  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring territories and lead to unity with our kith\r\n\r\nand  kin elsewhere. In this sense our independence is  a\r\n\r\nboon.  That  we  are independent and  sovereign  no  one\r\n\r\ndoubts, except the pro-Communist Barisan Sosialis.  They\r\n\r\nhave  boycotted this first session of the Parliament  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and history will damn them for this stupidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Afro-Asian world has acknowledged our\r\n\r\nindependence, and we have been admitted into the  United\r\n\r\nNations. But to the Barisan Sosialis our independence is\r\n\r\n\"phoney\".  The term \"phoney\" has been so  much  used  by\r\n\r\nthem  for every conceivable reason that one wonders what\r\n\r\nthey really mean by \"phoney\". Indeed, I am beginning  to\r\n\r\nthink that the very existence of the Barisan Sosialis is\r\n\r\n\"phoney\", because they exist not for Singapore  but  for\r\n\r\nothers  who  are  not interested in  Singapore  and  her\r\n\r\npeople.  But if they would really apply their  minds  to\r\n\r\nwhat  has  happened to Aidit and the P.K.I., they  would\r\n\r\nhave enough time to mend their ways. Otherwise a similar\r\n\r\ndisaster can well befall them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Afro-Asian countries have accepted us as truly\r\n\r\nindependent and sovereign, committed to a policy of \r\n\r\nnon-alignment.  Even  Russia and Yugoslavia  - Communist\r\n\r\nnations - have understood why we still require British\r\n\r\nbases. We are a small nation and it is only natural  for\r\n\r\nsmall  nations  to require assistance for defence  until\r\n\r\ntheir  territorial  integrity can be  assured  by  other\r\n\r\nmeans.  The  fact of life in a turbulent world  must  be\r\n\r\naccepted  and South-East Asia is today a troubled  area.\r\n\r\nIt  would  be  foolish for us to say. \"Out with  foreign\r\n\r\nbases.\" The Barisan, however, use the existence  of  the\r\n\r\nbases\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  a weapon for malicious attack. Trincomalee in Ceylon\r\n\r\nwas for quite some time retained as a British naval base\r\n\r\nafter  Ceylon's  independence. President Nyerere  called\r\n\r\nfor  the  assistance of British troops sometime  ago  to\r\n\r\nquell  a  rebellion,  and today  Zambia  is  asking  for\r\n\r\nBritish  troops  to  guard the  Kariba  Dam.  Would  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  say  that the independence of these territories\r\n\r\nis  \"phoney\"  and neo-colonialist? The rub really  comes\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Barisan Sosialis endeavour  to  dissuade  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore from joining the volunteer force for\r\n\r\ntheir  own  self  preservation  and  security.  Can  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis guarantee the people this by dissuading\r\n\r\nthem?  We  do not want large standing forces  because  a\r\n\r\nsmall  nation  cannot afford to have them in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace,  as its primary duty is to ensure the social  and\r\n\r\neconomic  progress of the people. Again, we  cannot,  by\r\n\r\nany  stretch  of  the imagination, be an aggressor.  Our\r\n\r\nsize  rules  that out completely. However, there  is  no\r\n\r\nreason why we should not have a volunteer force. If  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  can fight  and  win  against  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists,    the    anti-nationalists    and     the\r\n\r\ncommunalists, the courage and quality of our youths  can\r\n\r\nalso   meet   the  challenges  for  our   survival   and\r\n\r\nprotection.  There  is  no doubt that  our  youths  will\r\n\r\nrespond to the call of duty and their responsibility  as\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  an independent country. The  Barisan  have\r\n\r\nlost the battle to do Singapore in. Whatever they do  or\r\n\r\nsay,  they  cannot affect the future of  Singapore  -  a\r\n\r\nnation  that  has the will to succeed  in  the  face  of\r\n\r\nonslaughts from anti-national elements, communalists and\r\n\r\nthe  illegitimate children of both these  elements,  the\r\n\r\ncrooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to associate myself\r\n\r\nwith  the  motion  which has been  moved  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

In  the Speech it is stated that the Government\r\n\r\nwould  treat  all races equally, safeguard their  rights\r\n\r\nand   interests,  and  realise  a  multi-racial, \r\n\r\nmulti-religious  and  multi-lingual society. I  fully  support\r\n\r\nthis  policy. Our country has been independent for  four\r\n\r\nmonths  now  and  many  countries  have  recognised  our\r\n\r\nindependence and sovereignty. The majority of Afro-Asian\r\n\r\ncountries  have  established foreign or trade  relations\r\n\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our purpose is to survive. In order to survive, we\r\n\r\nhave to get as many countries as possible to befriend us\r\n\r\nand to open up international markets so that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  can  maintain our economic standards.  International\r\n\r\nmarkets  are very important to us. But the eight Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Members opposite have chosen to  boycott  this\r\n\r\nSession. They have denounced our parliamentary democracy\r\n\r\nas false and our independence as phoney. I would like to\r\n\r\nask  them:  why do they not boycott their  allowance  of\r\n\r\n$500  each per month? Just look at them. They  want  the\r\n\r\nmoney   but  they  do  not  want  to  carry  out   their\r\n\r\nresponsibility or do any work. They are irresponsible in\r\n\r\nthis  respect.  There should he by-elections  to  decide\r\n\r\ntheir  seats.  They  have all along  been  inducing  the\r\n\r\nworkers  to go on strike and to carry out all  sorts  of\r\n\r\nactivities   to   sabotage  our   national   development\r\n\r\nprogramme and to overthrow our Government, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan  have  the  opportunity to take over  and  rule  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  But  their  subversive  activities  can  never\r\n\r\nsucceed.  They  have  been saying this:  drive  out  the\r\n\r\nBritish  bases here and make friends with Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nthe  Communists of other countries. If such actions were\r\n\r\npossible, why have they failed? It shows that the people\r\n\r\nare  very  discerning  and they have  seen  through  the\r\n\r\ntactics  and intrigues of the Barisan Sosialis. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  they  have  met with disaster after  disaster  anti\r\n\r\nfailure after failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have also said\r\n\r\nthat   our  independence  on  the  9th  August  is   not\r\n\r\n\"correct\". We should realise that Malaysia and Singapore\r\n\r\nare  economically inter-dependent. One State  relies  on\r\n\r\nthe  other for existence, it is just like a human being,\r\n\r\nmade  up  of flesh and blood. So it is not possible  for\r\n\r\none  to  have only skin without flesh, or flesh  without\r\n\r\nskin.  That  is  the relationship between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  The  logical conclusion,  therefore,  is  the\r\n\r\ncoming  together  of  the  two  territories.  Our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  and also our Minister for Finance, have  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  two  countries should co-operate economically\r\n\r\nand work closely together in order to bring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nabout a better standard of living for the two halves  of\r\n\r\none body of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For next year there is about $500 million in revenue,\r\n\r\nand expenditure will be slightly less than that, and  in\r\n\r\nthe  end, there will be a small surplus of about  a  few\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars. From this, we can see that our economy\r\n\r\nis stable. It is a sound economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in March this year the Ministry of\r\n\r\nNational Development sold the pre-war Tiong Bahru houses\r\n\r\nin order to permit the people to own their own homes. As\r\n\r\none  who  resides  in this area, I wish  to  express  my\r\n\r\nthanks on behalf of the residents in Tiong Bahru to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Talking of the rents  of  these  houses,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that those who cannot pay the initial deposit on\r\n\r\nrents  should  he  given  generous  consideration.   One\r\n\r\nmonth's notice of such payment should be given to  these\r\n\r\npeople,  and only then can any action be taken. This  is\r\n\r\nto  lessen the difficulties of the people concerned. The\r\n\r\npractice at the moment is that a notice is issued  after\r\n\r\nonly seven days of the due date. Several days after  the\r\n\r\nissue  of this notice, another notice is issued  to  the\r\n\r\noccupier  to  quit  the house. The first  notice  is  to\r\n\r\ndemand  the payment of rent, and the second is to  evict\r\n\r\nthe  occupier and also demand the payment of  all  rents\r\n\r\ndue.  In  my  view,  this measure is a  bit  too  harsh,\r\n\r\nbecause,  in addition to the arrears of rent, there  are\r\n\r\nother  payments  to  be made on receipt  of  the  second\r\n\r\nnotice.  So  I hope that the Housing Board will  take  a\r\n\r\nmore  liberal  view in this regard and  not  just  issue\r\n\r\neviction notices which will affect the livelihood of the\r\n\r\npeople concerned. I hope the authorities will take steps\r\n\r\nto  rectify  these  measures in  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  let me first express my gratitude to the Yang  \r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara for his Speech to this House, which  sets\r\n\r\nout  in clear terms the tasks ahead and the efforts that\r\n\r\nhave  to  be exerted by all of us in Singapore  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture prosperity and happiness of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the Business sessions having commenced for\r\n\r\nseveral days now, I find it most difficult to comprehend\r\n\r\nthe  reasons for Members of this House in the Opposition\r\n\r\nto  stay away, particularly when vital matters affecting\r\n\r\nthe  nation  and  the  future of our  people  are  being\r\n\r\ndiscussed. Although confusion and uncertainty could have\r\n\r\nled  to  their absence, I can only conclude  that  their\r\n\r\naction   amounts   to  a  clear  abdication   of   their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities to the people of Singapore. These  men,\r\n\r\nwho  have  constantly spoken as if they, and only  they,\r\n\r\nare the knights of freedom and democracy and leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, have now demonstrated publicly that  it  is\r\n\r\npart  of their creed to abdicate responsibility whenever\r\n\r\nit  suits them - without even ascertaining the  wishes\r\n\r\nof  those  who elected them to this House. To use  their\r\n\r\nown  vocabulary,  I can only say that their  actions  in\r\n\r\nthis  regard are indeed phoney, particularly when it  is\r\n\r\nabundantly  clear that these Members of  Parliament  are\r\n\r\nabiding  by  the  wishes  of  Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh,  who\r\n\r\nincidentally is not a Member of this House,  as  against\r\n\r\nthe wishes of those who elected them. It is obvious from\r\n\r\ntheir  actions that it is they who are the  stooges  and\r\n\r\nnot us in the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been given a glaring demonstration of their\r\n\r\nintellectual dishonesty, I am sure that our citizens now\r\n\r\nrealise  that they have elected a bunch of men  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to make unsubstantiated criticisms about  this\r\n\r\nHouse after having been here for the past two years  and\r\n\r\nnot  forgetting the financial rewards they have  derived\r\n\r\nfrom  its  membership. Be that as  it  may,  what  other\r\n\r\ninterpretation could we give to this insane move?  Could\r\n\r\nthey  have  exhausted their supply of \r\n\r\ngramophone-record-like  speeches and remarks? Is it because they now  find\r\n\r\nit  extremely untenable to continue as spokesmen for the\r\n\r\nanti-national  forces, following recent developments  in\r\n\r\nour  neighbouring country? Or can it be that, with their\r\n\r\nchannel of overseas instructions, which had served  them\r\n\r\nwell  during  the  few  years, now disrupted,  they  are\r\n\r\nawaiting   fresh   channels  of  communication   to   be\r\n\r\nestablished?  To my mind, it is this disruption  of  the\r\n\r\nchannel of communication\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the delay in receiving directions from abroad  that\r\n\r\nhas  prompted them to stay away - lest any remarks  they\r\n\r\nmake  in this House prove to he contrary to instructions\r\n\r\nthat  may  yet come from their foreign masters. Whatever\r\n\r\nit may be. I feel sorry for them today. The intelligence\r\n\r\nand   political  awareness  of  our  people   makes   it\r\n\r\nimpossible  for them to play the role of  \"Proxies\"  for\r\n\r\noverseas  masters, without being hounded from pillar  to\r\n\r\npost, and life indeed must be difficult for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the policy Speech of the Head of State, reference\r\n\r\nwas  made  to the need for awareness amongst workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   for  the  successful  industrialisation   of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the creation of job opportunities. Mention\r\n\r\nwas  also made of irresponsible trade unionism and trade\r\n\r\nunion  actions  for  political motives.  First,  Jet  me\r\n\r\nassure  the  House  that  the  democratic  trade   union\r\n\r\nmovement in Singapore, which today represents more  than\r\n\r\n75  per cent of organised workers, is fully aware of its\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. It believes that it cannot operate  in\r\n\r\na  vacuum. As an organised part of society, it  believes\r\n\r\nthat it has a clear and positive role to play, primarily\r\n\r\nto  safeguard the legitimate interests of labour and  to\r\n\r\nfight  exploitation  of labour  in  any  form.  It  also\r\n\r\nrecognises  that  the economic stagnation  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  inevitably  mean the emasculation  of  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement,  and therefore its own future is  inextricably\r\n\r\ntied  up with the economic future of Singapore. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  remind  this House that it is this  basic  and\r\n\r\nfundamental realisation that has led workers, led by the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C.,  to  give  their full support  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme. We fully believe that  this\r\n\r\nprogramme must succeed and, we say here and now, that in\r\n\r\nthe  years  ahead, we will demonstrate our capacity  and\r\n\r\nability  to  adjust  ourselves  not  only  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  but also prepare for some of the  sacrifices\r\n\r\nwhich  the  pioneering years of industrialisation  ahead\r\n\r\nwill call for. But, lest it be mistaken, let me also say\r\n\r\nthat workers have no intention of giving any employer  a\r\n\r\nblank cheque for exploitation. In this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregard, it will largely fall upon Government to continue\r\n\r\nto  ensure that employers make an equal contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe  national  development  and  share  our  trials  and\r\n\r\ntribulations. We seek an assurance from Government  that\r\n\r\nit  will  not  encourage employers to seek  refuge  from\r\n\r\ntheir  obligations and use these economic  circumstances\r\n\r\nto  exploit  and stifle the aspirations  of  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As my colleague, the Member for  Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nhas  already mentioned, employers in Singapore, like any\r\n\r\nemployers   elsewhere,  are  already  giving   different\r\n\r\nunintended  interpretations to certain  remarks  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister. We are also aware that some among  them\r\n\r\neven  chose  this occasion to use our struggles  against\r\n\r\nthe  anti-national forces in our midst to  play  workers\r\n\r\nagainst  workers,  thus hoping to deny  workers  in  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic   trade   union  movement  their   legitimate\r\n\r\nrewards.  To  those  employers,  I  give  notice   that,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding  the need for stable  labour  conditions\r\n\r\nfor  our own economic future, we in the democratic trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement will not hesitate to make exceptions  of\r\n\r\nsuch employers, regardless of Government's policies.  We\r\n\r\nwill endeavour, through sheer economic unionism and  not\r\n\r\npolitical  motives, to teach them some  lessons  on  how\r\n\r\ncollective  bargaining  and labour-management  relations\r\n\r\nshould  be conducted in a free and independent  country.\r\n\r\nIn  welcoming this remark by His Excellency the Yang \r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara. I hope that the Government will equally\r\n\r\nensure  that employers do not take this plea for  stable\r\n\r\nlabour  conditions to be an indication  that  Government\r\n\r\nwould  he  a  silent  spectator of the  exploitation  of\r\n\r\nworkers in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it was indeed heartening to note that our\r\n\r\nforeign  policy  aims at having the  maximum  number  of\r\n\r\nfriends  and  the  least  number of  hostile  countries.\r\n\r\nSpeaking as a worker, I must say that this is indeed  an\r\n\r\nenlightened  policy to follow. We workers  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave always recognised this need for positive neutrality\r\n\r\nand  Afro-Asian solidarity. Unlike those absent  Members\r\n\r\nfrom the opposite row, who preach a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbrand  of Afro-Asian solidarity which changes from  time\r\n\r\nto  time,  the  workers  in  the  democratic  wing  have\r\n\r\nconsistently believed that positive neutrality  was  and\r\n\r\nstill is the correct policy for Singapore. We have never\r\n\r\nsupported  ideological  exclusiveness  and  have  always\r\n\r\nadhered to establishing fraternal relations with workers\r\n\r\nin  the  Afro-Asian world on the basis of mutual respect\r\n\r\nfor each other's approaches to fundamental problems.  As\r\n\r\nevident  from  the  large number of fraternal  delegates\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Afro-Asian trade unions who recently gathered\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  for  the National Trades  Union  Congress\r\n\r\nAnnual  Convention and the international Labour Seminar,\r\n\r\nthese   policies  have  always  paid  dividends.  Having\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in  a small way in fostering this  friendship\r\n\r\namong  Afro-Asian  nations for us in  Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union field, we naturally feel confident that  we\r\n\r\ncan  speak  from  direct personal  experience  that  the\r\n\r\npolicy  indicated in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Speech\r\n\r\nis  the  right  one to adhere to. We should consistently\r\n\r\ndisplay our adherence to the principles of non-alignment\r\n\r\nand  the  ideal of Afro-Asian solidarity, based  on  the\r\n\r\nBandung  principles.  Far from being  fence-sitters,  we\r\n\r\nshould  never  hesitate to make known  that  we  dislike\r\n\r\nanybody  making up our minds for us. Speaking on  behalf\r\n\r\nof  the workers of Singapore, I am indeed glad that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  seen the righteousness  of  this  trade\r\n\r\nunion philosophy in international relations and embodied\r\n\r\nit  as  the  cornerstone of the foreign  policy  of  our\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking as one who belongs to the democratic trade\r\n\r\nunion movement, let me assure the House that the workers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore will stand resolutely by the Government in\r\n\r\nthe  years  ahead so long as it adheres to a  policy  of\r\n\r\npositive   neutrality  in  international   affairs   and\r\n\r\nrespects  the institutional independence of the  working\r\n\r\nclass led by the National Trades Union Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permit me, Mr Speaker, Sir, to close my remarks with\r\n\r\nthe expression that the workers of Singapore, with their\r\n\r\nhigh  degree  of political consciousness, will  have  no\r\n\r\nsympathy for those who have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  disgracefully  abdicated their responsibilities  to\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore and stayed away from the  open\r\n\r\nargument  taking  place in this House,  to  decide  the\r\n\r\ndestiny of our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Minister of State for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of\r\n\r\nthe  motion in the name of the Prime Minister  to  thank\r\n\r\nHis Excellency for his Speech in this Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, speaking as the Member for Hong Lim, I\r\n\r\nhave  a  mixed  variety of feelings. The by-election  in\r\n\r\nHong  Lim has, to a certain extent, some connection with\r\n\r\nthe  independence of Singapore and the  emergence  of  a\r\n\r\nParliament in Singapore. If the P.A.P. had been defeated\r\n\r\nin  the Hong Lim by-election, probably we would not have\r\n\r\nhad  an  independent  Singapore, to  say  nothing  of  a\r\n\r\nParliament.   Even  the  existence  of  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly   would   have  been  in  doubt   under   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts show that after Singapore was kicked out of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  the  leaders  of our  immediate  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountry said openly that if Singapore had not agreed  to\r\n\r\nleave  Malaysia, then probably repressive  action  would\r\n\r\nhave  had  to be taken, thereby giving rise  to  further\r\n\r\nbloodshed. That clearly shows that they would  not  have\r\n\r\nhesitated  to  do what they had said they  would  do  if\r\n\r\nSingapore  had  refused to leave Malaysia.  Under  those\r\n\r\ncircumstances, if we had not left Malaysia, there  would\r\n\r\nnot be an independent Singapore nor a Parliament sitting\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, after Singapore was kicked out of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  what do we see with regard to the actions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis? In page 1 of the  Barisan  Party\r\n\r\nOrgan published on the 11th of September, we notice  one\r\n\r\narticle  with  the title, \"Where is Democracy?  An  Open\r\n\r\nArgument\".  In  this article, the Barisan  demanded  the\r\n\r\nimmediate convening of Parliament; and the article  went\r\n\r\non  to  say,  \"The Lee Kuan Yew regime still refuses  to\r\n\r\ncall a meeting of the Legislative Assembly in spite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  repeated  requests of the Opposition  Members.\r\n\r\nThe Lee Kuan Yew regime seems to treat the question  of\r\n\r\nindependence  as  one  of  its  own  Party's  problems,\r\n\r\nthereby  treating  the  Legislative  Assembly   as   an\r\n\r\nexpendable  showpiece.\" Mr Speaker, this  is  from  an\r\n\r\narticle  published in the Party Organ  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis wherein they made their demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the Government was very busily engaged\r\n\r\nin  setting up relationships with other nations  in  the\r\n\r\nworld,  laying  its  foundations  in  the  international\r\n\r\narena,  and  finding trading outlets for the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. So a Goodwill Mission under the leadership of\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister visited countries in Afro-Asia\r\n\r\nand  Eastern  Europe. We have made  friends  with  these\r\n\r\ncountries  and  we  have laid a new  foundation  in  our\r\n\r\ninternational  relationships. The Goodwill  Mission  has\r\n\r\naccomplished its task, and we are now in this House. But\r\n\r\nwe  are  facing  a boycott by the Barisan Sosialis.  Why\r\n\r\nshould they boycott the proceedings of this House?  Only\r\n\r\na  few months ago, Mr Speaker, they were clamouring for\r\n\r\nan  immediate sitting of the Assembly. Why should  there\r\n\r\nbe  a sudden change now in their policy and strategy?  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should review the circumstances,  and  I  can\r\n\r\noffer   several  reasons  for  their  boycott  of   this\r\n\r\nAssembly. Firstly, they are running away from facts  and\r\n\r\nrealities,  because they know by now that  more  than  a\r\n\r\nhundred  nations  in  the United  Nations  Organisation,\r\n\r\nincluding Russia which is a Communist country,  as  well\r\n\r\nas   the  other  Communist  countries,  have  recognised\r\n\r\nSingapore as an independent sovereign State; and if  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Members were to attend the sittings  in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  then  it would be difficult  for  them  to\r\n\r\nreconcile the fact of their attendance with their slogan\r\n\r\nof \"Phoney independence! \". They would then be making  a\r\n\r\nlaughing  stock  of themselves. That is the  reason  why\r\n\r\nthey are not attending these proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason, Mr Speaker, is that there is now\r\n\r\nan  internal  split in the Barisan Sosialis itself.  Dr\r\n\r\nLee Siew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChoh,  not  being  a Member of this House,  cannot  give\r\n\r\nexpression to his showmanship in this House  and  so  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  want Members of his Party to avail themselves\r\n\r\nof the opportunity to do so. Neither is he in a position\r\n\r\nto   gain  control  of  those  Party  members  who  have\r\n\r\ndivergent  views  and he is afraid  that  they  may  say\r\n\r\nsomething  against him or his Party in this House.  That\r\n\r\nagain is another reason for the boycott.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason, Mr Speaker, and this is the most\r\n\r\nimportant  one,  is  that some leaders  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have already succumbed to the truth.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthem  have  openly shown their repentance and  confessed\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  made mistakes in the past.  They  have\r\n\r\ncriticised and even renounced Communism. Others  who  do\r\n\r\nnot dare come out in open criticism of Communism are  in\r\n\r\na  state of confusion, thereby making themselves fit for\r\n\r\npsychiatric treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along, Mr Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis have been\r\n\r\nboasting  that  only their Party, the Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\nhave  the support of the people. This is what they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  claiming,  and  they say that  they  alone  really\r\n\r\nrepresent  the  people.  But  look  at  the  facts,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker;  the referendum in 1962, the general  elections\r\n\r\nin  1963 and the Hong Lim by-election in 1965 all go  to\r\n\r\nprove that the people are on our side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore support socialism, democracy\r\n\r\nand  parliamentary procedure. They are in support  of  a\r\n\r\nsocialist  democratic Party, because they  realise  that\r\n\r\nsocialist  democracy  and a socialist  democratic  Party\r\n\r\nlike  the  P.A.P. can  bring  about  the  progress  and\r\n\r\nprosperity  of  Singapore without  bloodshed.  They  can\r\n\r\nraise the living standard of the people. The people have\r\n\r\nrealised that only by democratic socialism can they have\r\n\r\na  better future. Since the Barisan Sosialis have learnt\r\n\r\nthese  lessons from history, they have come  to  realise\r\n\r\nthat  it is impossible for them to capture power by  the\r\n\r\none-man one-vote system through peaceful means; so they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  no  choice  but  to change their  basic  stand  in\r\n\r\nabandoning  the  line of capturing power  by  democratic\r\n\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis have not been\r\n\r\ngenuine in their belief in the parliamentary system.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  they  want to make use of this system to  destroy\r\n\r\nthe  system  itself  in order to establish  a  one-party\r\n\r\nautocracy.  If they were really sincere in their  belief\r\n\r\nin  parliamentary democracy, then as an Opposition  they\r\n\r\nshould have had some effect in this House, because it is\r\n\r\nunder  the  system of parliamentary democracy  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition is charged with the responsibility  to  guide\r\n\r\nand  criticise the Government, to point out the mistakes\r\n\r\nof  the Government, and to put the Government on to  the\r\n\r\nproper path, so that whatever actions the Government may\r\n\r\ntake  or are taking will not be against the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  people. But in spite of the responsibility  charged\r\n\r\nupon  them,  they are now boycotting the proceedings  in\r\n\r\nthis House, thereby showing that they have forsaken  the\r\n\r\nmandate given to them by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we support the bi-party system because we\r\n\r\nare  of the opinion that, although human beings are  the\r\n\r\nmost  intelligent of all forms of life, they are  by  no\r\n\r\nmeans   perfect.   Even  saints   themselves   are   not\r\n\r\ninfallible. So we cannot say that whatever we do is  not\r\n\r\nwithout fault. That is why there is the necessity for an\r\n\r\nOpposition  to  be  present here and this  is  part  and\r\n\r\nparcel of our parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, under this parliamentary democracy the\r\n\r\nParty  in power has to go back to the people every  five\r\n\r\nyears.  It  has  to return the power to  the  people  at\r\n\r\nintervals of five years. Because of the existence of  an\r\n\r\nOpposition and because of the fact of having  to  return\r\n\r\nthe  power to the people every five years, there is  the\r\n\r\nnecessity for the Government or the Party in power to be\r\n\r\nvery  careful in handling the affairs of the people  and\r\n\r\nthe nation. But today, because of the boycott staged  by\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis,  the P.A.P. in  this  House  is\r\n\r\nwithout  a single opponent, a situation which  has  been\r\n\r\nforced upon us. But in spite of all this,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, and in view of our beliefs, our convictions\r\n\r\nand our respect for the parliamentary democratic system,\r\n\r\nwe  are  encouraging our Back-benchers to  come  out  to\r\n\r\ncriticise the measures to be taken or have been taken by\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This again goes to show our sincerity in our belief in\r\n\r\nthe  socialist parliamentary democratic system.  If  the\r\n\r\npeople  have  lost  confidence in the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nentirely  so  as  to result in all the 51 constituencies\r\n\r\nbeing  in  the hands of the P.A.P., thereby  making  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. a one-party autocracy, then whatever it  may  be\r\n\r\nwill  be achieved through the democratic process of  the\r\n\r\none-man  one-vote system, and this will  be  done  by  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election.  The abandonment  of  the  democratic\r\n\r\nstruggle  by  the  Barisan Sosialis  is  worthy  of  our\r\n\r\nattention, because we have to know what steps they  will\r\n\r\ntake  to achieve their aims. Will they, for example,  go\r\n\r\nbeyond the constitutional limits to resort to unpeaceful\r\n\r\nand  unconstitutional means for their  revolution?  This\r\n\r\nwill  only be proved by time and history. We do not know\r\n\r\nat  this  stage, but at any rate if they  choose  to  do\r\n\r\nthis,  then I can foretell their fate right now  -  that\r\n\r\nthey will only be digging their own graves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in order to have a Common Market we tried\r\n\r\nvery  hard  in  the past to secure a merger  by  way  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  but  the Barisan at that time  were  shouting\r\n\r\nthat  merger  was phoney. If, assuming  that  they  were\r\n\r\nright, that merger was phoney, that merger sold away the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the people of Singapore,  then  today  we\r\n\r\nwould not have been kicked out of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the slogan of the Barisan Sosialis all\r\n\r\nalong has been that Malaysia is phoney, that Malaysia is\r\n\r\na  neo-colonialist plot, an intrigue, but  in  spite  of\r\n\r\ntheir  slogan,  they sent three representatives  to  the\r\n\r\nParliament  of the Malaysian Federation. In  fact,  they\r\n\r\nwere  sworn in and demonstrated their loyalty by  taking\r\n\r\npart  in  the swearing-in ceremony for Malaysia at  that\r\n\r\ntime. If Malaysia was phoney, then why should they swear\r\n\r\nthe  Oath of Allegiance to Malaysia? Now they turn round\r\n\r\nand say that Singapore's independence is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphoney.  This  is  the  biggest laughing  stock  in  the\r\n\r\ntwentieth  century.  This is  a  most  peculiar  way  of\r\n\r\ntalking  things in this century. Those who believe  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's independence is phoney in fact require  more\r\n\r\npsychiatric  treatment  than the inmates  of  Woodbridge\r\n\r\nHospital,  because  ever  since we  became  independent,\r\n\r\nthere  has  not been a single country which has  opposed\r\n\r\nour  admission to the United Nations Organisation.  Even\r\n\r\nRussia  has  not objected to our presence in this  world\r\n\r\nbody. In fact, Russia has agreed to send a trade mission\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.  The same applies to some  East  European\r\n\r\ncountries which are Communist in nature. They  are  also\r\n\r\nwilling  to  come here to establish trade  relationships\r\n\r\nwith Singapore. If Singapore's independence were phoney,\r\n\r\nthen  the  more  than one hundred countries  which  have\r\n\r\nrecognised us, the people of these countries  must  have\r\n\r\nbeen mad, but the fact is that those who have gone crazy\r\n\r\nare  not  the  one hundred and more nations  which  have\r\n\r\nrecognised  us,  but  the Barisan Sosialis.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis that have gone mad. I say so because we\r\n\r\ncan  never  see  anywhere in the world  any  people  who\r\n\r\nrefuse  to  recognise  the  independence  of  their  own\r\n\r\ncountry.  If  the  Barisan  Sosialis  still  refuse   to\r\n\r\nrecognise  our independence, then they must  also  admit\r\n\r\nthat  they are phoney citizens of Singapore. That  being\r\n\r\nso,  they  are  not fit to be citizens of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthey should not enjoy the rights of Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as we can see now, even Russia, China and\r\n\r\nsome  other  Communist countries have  recognised  their\r\n\r\nindependence.  They  recognised  their  sovereignty  and\r\n\r\ntheir nations as such. The true disciple of Marxism  was\r\n\r\nTrotsky  who  believed  that  the  revolution   of   the\r\n\r\nCommunist world must be above the national interest.  It\r\n\r\nwas  only  he  who  genuinely believed  that  after  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  revolution  of  the  Communist  world,   all\r\n\r\nnations  in the world would perish. Perhaps the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is  the incarnation of the life  and  soul  of\r\n\r\nTrotsky. And it will attempt to start a world revolution\r\n\r\nin  the  Communist fold above the national interest.  In\r\n\r\nthe minds of people like Trotsky, nations are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphoney;  it  is  revolution that is  genuine.  But  what\r\n\r\nhappens to this kind of people? They are either crazy or\r\n\r\nthey have committed suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eviction of Singapore from Malaysia is a temporary\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  battle  between  the  nationalist   and\r\n\r\ncommunal forces. We have to avoid this type of cold war.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  this cold war turned into a hot war,  namely,\r\n\r\nbloodshed, as a result of communal strife. So  Singapore\r\n\r\nwas evicted from Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have faced many trials and\r\n\r\ntribulations.  Those of us born and  bred  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ncannot  forget  our  brothers  and  sisters  across  the\r\n\r\nCauseway. In fact, the worst thing one can do is to  lie\r\n\r\nto  oneself  and  say that the people of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  are  two different types of  people.  For  140\r\n\r\nyears,  the people of Singapore and Malaysia  have  been\r\n\r\nunder  the  rule of the British colonialists. They  went\r\n\r\nthrough similar sufferings in both territories and  they\r\n\r\nwere  determined to strive for freedom and independence.\r\n\r\nWe  are  determined  to suffer and work  together.  This\r\n\r\nspirit  of  sacrifice  and hard work  is  not  what  the\r\n\r\nConstitution can provide. Neither can the constitutional\r\n\r\narrangements  stifle these qualities. In  the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears, we have felt the poison spread as a result of the\r\n\r\nwork  of  communal forces, and we hope that our brothers\r\n\r\nacross the Causeway will not repeat this foolish act. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, Singapore suffered a great deal because\r\n\r\nof  the  emergence of communal forces, and now  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  evicted because of the rise of communalism. We  do\r\n\r\nhope that history will not repeat itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an island faced with trials and\r\n\r\ntribulations. After the P.A.P. Government came to  power\r\n\r\nin  1959, we went through serious troubles almost  every\r\n\r\nyear.  In  1960, there was Mr Ong Eng Guan who believed\r\n\r\nin  individualism  and who liked  to  fish  in  troubled\r\n\r\nwaters.  In 1962, he revealed his hypocrisy. He  claimed\r\n\r\nto serve the interests of the people, but in fact he was\r\n\r\na  pseudo-revolutionist. And in 1962, he was  busy  with\r\n\r\nslogans of \"phoney\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerger\", and he called for general elections. These were\r\n\r\nthe  years when we had Mr Ong Eng Guan and the  Barisan\r\n\r\nincidents.  In  1963, there was a general  election.  In\r\n\r\n1964, we participated in the Federal elections and there\r\n\r\nwere two riots in Singapore. In 1965, we were kicked out\r\n\r\nby  the  racialists from Malaysia. It seems  that  every\r\n\r\nyear there are incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., while undergoing all these difficulties,\r\n\r\nhas  been able to fulfil the Five-Year Development Plan.\r\n\r\nThrough  democratic socialist methods, it  has  resolved\r\n\r\nthe housing problem and has improved the living standard\r\n\r\nand  safeguarded the welfare of the people. And we  have\r\n\r\nestablished the basis for industrialisation.  All  these\r\n\r\nachievements have been due to the support of the people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  these  achievements go  to  show  the  \r\n\r\nhardworking   spirit   and  intelligence  of   our   people.\r\n\r\nTherefore, although independent Singapore is faced  with\r\n\r\nall  these difficulties, I believe, in the end,  we  can\r\n\r\novercome  them  with the co-operation of the  Government\r\n\r\nand  the industry of the people. The people will, in the\r\n\r\nend,  overcome all these difficulties so that the Second\r\n\r\nFive-Year  Plan can materialise. Economically,  we  need\r\n\r\nnew  markets  so  that  our manufactures  will  have  an\r\n\r\noutlet.  We  need to build more factories  in  order  to\r\n\r\nprovide  more  employment  opportunities.  But  we  must\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  in any newly emerging  country,  there\r\n\r\nmust  be  a period of trials and tribulations.  Germany,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  a  defeated  country, went  through  various\r\n\r\ntrials   and   tribulations.   But   because   of    the\r\n\r\ndetermination  and  hard work of the people,  they  have\r\n\r\nrebuilt their country and their living standard has also\r\n\r\nbeen  raised. There is a saying that whoever can  endure\r\n\r\nextreme bitterness can become a man among men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the workers in Singapore can forge ahead and\r\n\r\nconsider  the  long-term  interest  in  order  that  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme can  materialise  and  that\r\n\r\nthey  would not just pay heed to the immediate  interest\r\n\r\nand  forget  the  future. If they can do  so,  then  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme will materialise earlier and\r\n\r\nour better days will come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearlier. We must always remember that although Singapore\r\n\r\nis a tiny island with a small population, her importance\r\n\r\nis  internationally recognised. We remember that  before\r\n\r\nthe  Second World War, there was a militarist  who  said\r\n\r\nthat  whoever  had control over Singapore could  control\r\n\r\nthe whole of South-East Asia. Our neighbouring countries\r\n\r\nhave recognised Singapore's strategic position. Although\r\n\r\nthe British bases are here to protect Singapore, we must\r\n\r\nnot  forget  our lesson in 1941. At that time  everybody\r\n\r\nthought that Singapore was an impregnable fort, that  it\r\n\r\ncould  not  be  conquered, and that everybody  need  not\r\n\r\nworry. Yet history has proved that in a short period  of\r\n\r\none  week, Singapore was taken like a split bamboo.  Why\r\n\r\nis it that Singapore fell so easily? The main reason was\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore was then a colony. Nationalism  had  not\r\n\r\ngerminated, and Singapore was not defended  by  her  own\r\n\r\npeople. It was not backed by the people. We can learn  a\r\n\r\nlesson  from  this. It is only through our own  strength\r\n\r\nand  our  own efforts that we can truly defend  our  own\r\n\r\ncountry and preserve our own security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some countries which are small, such as\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, but their citizens are patriotic. They  can\r\n\r\nturn all their people into soldiers, so that even strong\r\n\r\nnations  would not dare bully them. Although  there  are\r\n\r\nmany  soldiers with modern weapons in Vietnam, there  is\r\n\r\nno  end  to the war there because they do not  have  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the people. So we cannot fully depend  upon\r\n\r\nthe British bases to defend ourselves. We must depend on\r\n\r\nour  own strength, and we must have the backing  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have been kicked out from Malaysia, the\r\n\r\ntwo subsequent by-elections in Malaysia have proved that\r\n\r\nthe seed of nationalism has germinated and is coming  to\r\n\r\nfruition.  We  also hope that with the  increased  trend\r\n\r\ntowards nationalism, Malaysia will in the end be united.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I have given the example of Switzerland. Such\r\n\r\ncountries  can  even defend their tiny  nations  against\r\n\r\nstrong nations when they have the support of the people.\r\n\r\nHitler was a very notorious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndictator who looked down upon other nations. Yet in  the\r\n\r\nend  he was defeated. So it is in Singapore. If all  the\r\n\r\npeople  are  patriotic  and  are  willing  to  sacrifice\r\n\r\nthemselves;  if they are solidly united and  willing  to\r\n\r\nwork  hard, then I believe no country in the world  will\r\n\r\ndare to bully us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that in our multi-racial society, all the\r\n\r\nraces will be loyal and serve our country. We must  give\r\n\r\nequal  treatment to all the races. We must have a \r\n\r\nmulti-racial  policy.  That  is why we  have  tabled  in  this\r\n\r\nParliament  the Republic of Singapore Independence  Bill\r\n\r\nand   the  Constitution  (Amendment)  Bill.  They   have\r\n\r\nprovisions  to  safeguard the interests  of  minorities.\r\n\r\nThey  will  give freedom in language, religion,  culture\r\n\r\nand   other  things.  This  is  a  basic  principle   in\r\n\r\ndemocratic socialism. Based on this principle - \r\n\r\na multi-racial  society  -  there will be  peace,  progress  and\r\n\r\nprosperity in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must understand that Singapore is situated in\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia,  an  area  surrounded by  some\r\n\r\nanti-Chinese countries.  Any  chauvinistic attempt to turn \r\n\r\nSingapore into  a  third China  will only  bring about a major\r\n\r\ndisaster   and  tragedy  to  the  people  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSingapore will be encircled by unfriendly forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us point out seriously that if there is an upsurge\r\n\r\nof  racialism  in Singapore, then the consequences  will\r\n\r\nnot  be just one or two internal racial disturbances  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but it will also have repercussions  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If we allow Chinese chauvinism to  rear  its\r\n\r\nhead,  then Singapore will easily be isolated in  \r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia. It will be a country encircled by unfriendly\r\n\r\nforces. They will then attack Singapore, which is a tiny\r\n\r\ncountry.  Under  these circumstances, we cannot  imagine\r\n\r\nthat  we  can get help from Communist China or  anywhere\r\n\r\nelse.  The question is that, \"The distant waters  cannot\r\n\r\nbe made available to quench the fire that is immediately\r\n\r\nbefore  us.\" We have a situation in Indonesia where  the\r\n\r\nChinese  are persecuted. China could not send troops  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia to protect the Chinese other than raise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  protests. The Indonesian Communist Party has  been\r\n\r\nsuppressed  by  the Army, and yet the Chinese  Communist\r\n\r\nParty could not intervene. They could not send troops to\r\n\r\nhelp the P.K.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. Small countries which can he\r\n\r\nprotected by China are, from the geographical  point  of\r\n\r\nview, close to the Chinese border. \"The near waters  can\r\n\r\nhe  made  available  to quench the immediate  fire.\"  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, that is quite possible. There is the convenience\r\n\r\nof  nearness.  Also,  if anything happens  next  to  the\r\n\r\nChinese border, assistance from China will be quick  and\r\n\r\nimmediate.   This   is  all  due   to   the   favourable\r\n\r\ngeographical position. But the situation in Singapore is\r\n\r\ndifferent.  The Barisan Sosialis' idea is to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  Singapore  or a Chinese  Singapore.  Whatever\r\n\r\nthey  may  want Singapore to be, they will  finally  put\r\n\r\nSingapore in a situation where it is surrounded by \r\n\r\nanti-Chinese  forces.  Up  till now the Barisan  Sosialis  is\r\n\r\npursuing a foolish line - rash, reckless and dangerous\r\n\r\npolitical adventurers - a line which will ultimately  lead\r\n\r\nSingapore  into a situation which I have described  just\r\n\r\nnow.  I  hope  they will reconsider their step  and  not\r\n\r\nallow  Singapore to come to an impasse.  Singapore  must\r\n\r\nnot be allowed to get into such a situation, a situation\r\n\r\nin which she is surrounded by anti-Chinese forces. There\r\n\r\nis  only  one  way out, and that is, to practise \r\n\r\nmulti-racialism  and democratic socialism, There is  no  other\r\n\r\nalternative. This policy depends on the concerted action\r\n\r\nof all the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Minister of State for the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Department, Inche Yaacob, said that  we  were\r\n\r\nfaced  with  the  Ultras,  Malay  racialists,  who  were\r\n\r\npersuading  the  Malays in Singapore to  go  across  the\r\n\r\nCauseway. This is another manifestation and challenge of\r\n\r\nracialism.   If  this  scheme  were  to  succeed,   then\r\n\r\nnaturally Singapore would become a Chinese State. But we\r\n\r\nbelieve that this intrigue or scheme will naturally fail\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Singapore  Government  has  shown  in  all\r\n\r\nrespects  that its policy is one of multi-racialism  and\r\n\r\nthat it alone can look after the interests of all races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of Singapore depends on democratic socialism\r\n\r\nand  a  policy  of  multi-racialism and a  non-Communist\r\n\r\nsociety,  together with our non-aligned foreign  policy.\r\n\r\nWe  can  then  establish  friendly  relations  with  all\r\n\r\ncountries of the world, including the Republic of China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we want to establish friendly relations with\r\n\r\nthe  Republic  of  China,  we  do  not  propose  to  let\r\n\r\nSingapore  become a third China, because this will  only\r\n\r\nlead  to  suicide. This is a suicidal  attempt.  Only  a\r\n\r\npolicy  of  multi-racialism and non-alignment  can  lead\r\n\r\nSingapore   to   the  path  of  peace,   progress,   and\r\n\r\nprosperity, and this policy that we have is  not  unique\r\n\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I have mentioned that certain countries are\r\n\r\nable  to  prosper through two world wars. One example  I\r\n\r\ngave was Switzerland, which safely went through two wars\r\n\r\nand  yet was able to build herself up. This was all  due\r\n\r\nto her policy of non-alignment and also to the fact that\r\n\r\nno  other country wanted to bully her. It is because her\r\n\r\npeople  are  loyal  to  their Government  and  to  their\r\n\r\ncountry. So in this situation the only sane thing to  do\r\n\r\nis to look after the people and maintain their economic,\r\n\r\nsocial, political and racial interests. Seventy-two  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the Swiss people speak French, and 20 per  cent\r\n\r\nspeak  Italian. Also in other countries with  people  of\r\n\r\ndifferent races who speak different languages, there  is\r\n\r\nno   hindrance   to   their  national  development.   In\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, the national languages are French, Italian,\r\n\r\nSwiss, and German. This is so today. And the people  who\r\n\r\nspeak these different languages are liberal-minded. So I\r\n\r\nhope   that  every  one,  particularly  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, should he liberal-minded and should not force\r\n\r\nothers to speak only one language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we fear is the language policy adopted by our\r\n\r\nimmediate  neighbour.  We hope that  every  citizen  can\r\n\r\nspeak the national language. Nevertheless, the method to\r\n\r\nbe  adopted  should  be  one of persuasion  and  not  of\r\n\r\ncompulsion,  because history has taught  us  that  in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society where one racial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroup  tries  to compel other groups to do its  bidding,\r\n\r\nthen there will be no peace, progress, or prosperity  in\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore feel that our policy of\r\n\r\nmulti-racialism is the right one, and there will be \r\n\r\nsafeguards written into our Constitution to preserve \r\n\r\nthe rights  of the  minority groups. In foreign affairs, \r\n\r\nour policy  is one  of non-alignment. With all these policies \r\n\r\nand  with the  support  of  the people, we can succeed  in  \r\n\r\nmaking Singapore  the Switzerland of the East in a  few  years'\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the motion moved by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister to thank the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for\r\n\r\ndelivering his Speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

In particular, the  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure of the University was repeatedly diverted by\r\n\r\nthe   former   Vice-Chancellor  as   payment   for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of a cinema-like auditorium  costing  more\r\n\r\nthan $1 million. As a result, Government had to step  in\r\n\r\nand  make  an  immediate grant of $200,000  to  pay  the\r\n\r\nsalaries of both the academic and non-academic staff  in\r\n\r\nNovember 1964. A further advance of $660,000 had  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  soon after to meet the urgent students commitments\r\n\r\nof  the  university, particularly in respect of payments\r\n\r\nof  salaries  and  wages to the staff. Since  then,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has made another grant of $1 million to  tide\r\n\r\nover the financial difficulties till the end of 1965. In\r\n\r\nall,  since the reorganisation began in July  1964,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  made a total advance of  $1.86  million\r\n\r\ntowards  meeting  the  recurrent  expenditure   of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity.  This is in addition to the $1  million  for\r\n\r\nthe library, now under construction, which will be fully\r\n\r\nexpended in July 1966, when work on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary  is  scheduled to be completed, and  another  $1\r\n\r\nmillion  for scientific equipment and library books  out\r\n\r\nof  which a sum of $30,000 will be spent before the  end\r\n\r\nof  1965 for the equipment of a language laboratory  for\r\n\r\nteaching  languages  with  a modern  approach.
