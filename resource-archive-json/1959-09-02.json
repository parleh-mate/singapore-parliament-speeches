The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  reported that a  deficit  of  $14\r\n\r\nmillion  has to be disposed of. The sum itself  is\r\n\r\nnot  very large but what was of greater import  is\r\n\r\nthat  for  some time past current expenditure  had\r\n\r\nbeen  financed out of the reserves of the country.\r\n\r\nThis  points to a basic imbalance between  revenue\r\n\r\nand expenditure which needs looking into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Revenue balance now stands at about\r\n\r\nthree months' revenue. It is therefore a matter of\r\n\r\ncommon prudence that the revenue balance shall not\r\n\r\nbe  permitted  to go much below this limit  unless\r\n\r\nnew sources of liquidity are readily available. It\r\n\r\nhas  therefore been necessary to take a number  of\r\n\r\nsteps some of which have been severe in character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has frozen all vacancies arising\r\n\r\nin  the establishment without making a distinction\r\n\r\nas to the reasons for such vacancies, whether they\r\n\r\narise  from retirement or resignation, or  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are newly created posts. Special Expenditure\r\n\r\nhas  also  been frozen so that a careful  scrutiny\r\n\r\ncan  be  made  to  weed out items  which  are  not\r\n\r\nabsolutely  necessary.  A  Cabinet  committee  was\r\n\r\nformed,  consisting  of  the  Prime  Minister   as\r\n\r\nChairman, and the Deputy Prime Minister and myself\r\n\r\nas   the  other  members.  We  have  gone  through\r\n\r\napplications  from Ministries and departments  and\r\n\r\nhave set up the most stringent standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently all Ministers have been asked to\r\n\r\nscrutinise the state of the vote and to report  on\r\n\r\nwhat economies are possible. This whole process of\r\n\r\nfreezing and vetting of expenditure constitutes  a\r\n\r\nmajor   operation.   As   a  result,   substantial\r\n\r\neconomies have been effected and the total  amount\r\n\r\nof  reduction  has  reached the  figure  of  $25.7\r\n\r\nmillion. Of this, $20.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion  were reductions in the Ordinary Estimates\r\n\r\nand  $5.6  million were savings in the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates. This is a considerable achievement  and\r\n\r\nhas been made possible through the co-operation of\r\n\r\nall departments of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to pay a special tribute to senior\r\n\r\nTreasury officials who have had to put in long and\r\n\r\npunishing  hours  of work in the  course  of  this\r\n\r\nexercise.  I  also want to acknowledge  the  full-hearted  support of my colleagues in this  economy\r\n\r\ndrive.  My colleagues and I work as a team and  it\r\n\r\nis  because  we work as a team that  it  has  been\r\n\r\npossible  to  reduce the estimated expenditure  by\r\n\r\nthis substantial amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be idle to pretend, however, that the\r\n\r\nslashes in the economy drive of this magnitude can\r\n\r\nbe  brought out painlessly. Everyone is  aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  pained  reaction  to  the  cuts  in  variable\r\n\r\nallowances.  Because of the freeze  on  vacancies,\r\n\r\nmany Ministries have to work short-handed and this\r\n\r\nmeans that everyone works harder. Then many of the\r\n\r\nschemes  which have been entered in the  Estimates\r\n\r\nafter  years of tussle with the Treasury have  now\r\n\r\nto be jettisoned or at least postponed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation has not been a painless one but it\r\n\r\nis   necessary,  in  the  interest  of   financial\r\n\r\nsolvency, that one sets one's face sternly against\r\n\r\nthe cries of anguish coming from the stricken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now in the happy position to report to the\r\n\r\nAssembly  that, as a result of our exertions,  the\r\n\r\nfinances  of  the Government have now  attained  a\r\n\r\nhealthier  state. Before I present the  facts  and\r\n\r\nfigures,  there is one point to which  I  wish  to\r\n\r\ndraw  attention.  And this is that  not  only  had\r\n\r\nauthorised expenditure exceeded estimated  revenue\r\n\r\nby  a  substantial amount when we took office  but\r\n\r\nthere were signs that certain items of revenue had\r\n\r\nnot been keeping up with the estimated levels.  In\r\n\r\nparticular, the tobacco revenue has declined  very\r\n\r\nseriously  as compared with the amount  estimated.\r\n\r\nThis  has  increased  both  the  difficulties   of\r\n\r\nbalancing the Budget and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  urgency to do so. I show in summary form  how\r\n\r\nthe  finances  of the Government  now  stand.  The\r\n\r\nfigures  are  given in Table 1*  which  have  been\r\n\r\ndistributed to Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Appendix I, cols. 629-30.\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1959/19590902/19590902-HA-0110629.pdf\"\">APPENDIX I(Cols 0629-0630)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the reductions by Ministers and sub-divisions of expenditure are shown in Table 2+.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+Appendix II, cols. 629-30.\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1959/19590902/19590902-HA-0110630.pdf\"\">APPENDIX II(Cols 0629-0630)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general position is that we are now faced\r\n\r\nwith  a small deficit of $2.9 million. This  is  a\r\n\r\ncomparatively  small sum. It  is  likely  that  we\r\n\r\nshall  end the year on an even keel. There may  be\r\n\r\nneed  for  additional expenditure  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nclaims  already submitted by Ministries and  which\r\n\r\nare  under  examination. As against  this,  it  is\r\n\r\npossible  that we may tap new sources of  revenue.\r\n\r\nAs  stated  in the policy speech of the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara, this Government will not consider\r\n\r\nrevenue   increases  until  all  possible  economy\r\n\r\nmeasures  have  first been applied.  We  have  now\r\n\r\nreached  this  stage  and  are  free  to  consider\r\n\r\nproposals to increase revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said before that we shall probably\r\n\r\n\"balance\" the Budget, I used the word in reference\r\n\r\nto the accounting practice adopted in the past. It\r\n\r\nhad  been  the practice for some time  to  finance\r\n\r\npart  of  the  development  by  depleting  reserve\r\n\r\nfunds. In 1959, this practice has continued in the\r\n\r\nEstimates. Members will note in Section B  3  (iv)\r\n\r\nin  the  first Table that $18.5 million is  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  from the General Revenue  balance  to\r\n\r\nthe  Development  Budget. As I  said  earlier,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  allow the General Revenue balance  to\r\n\r\nfall  much  below its present level  and  it  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  necessary to finance  part  of  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Expenditure by loans. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  already announced its intention to float  two\r\n\r\nloans of different maturities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this assessment of the financial position of\r\n\r\nthe  country, I must therefore make some reference\r\n\r\nto   the   state  of  the  public  debt  and   the\r\n\r\naccumulation  of  funds which the  Government  and\r\n\r\nvarious statutory bodies under its direction  hold\r\n\r\nlocally and abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the Government is concerned, the public\r\n\r\ndebt has been very small. This has its virtues. At\r\n\r\nthe same time, it must be borne in mind that there\r\n\r\nis no merit in not borrowing money from the public\r\n\r\nif  this  means  retarding  essential  development\r\n\r\nschemes  and services which are necessary  to  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  the  economy.  More  especially  where\r\n\r\npublic  savings are available, it  is  foolish  to\r\n\r\ndeny  these sound opportunities for investment  in\r\n\r\nthis   country - investments  which  would   promote\r\n\r\nfurther  expansion  in  various  sectors  of   the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as this Government itself is concerned,\r\n\r\nthe  position is that the total public debt stands\r\n\r\nat  $115 million. Of this, sinking funds have been\r\n\r\naccumulated  which  amount to about  $75  million.\r\n\r\nThere  is  therefore  a net  public  debt  of  $40\r\n\r\nmillion or some $25 per head of population.  There\r\n\r\nare  very few governments which have a public debt\r\n\r\nas low as this. Further, we must take into account\r\n\r\nthe various reserve funds which the Government has\r\n\r\naccumulated  in the various funds  and  the  loans\r\n\r\nadvanced  to statutory bodies. These latter  total\r\n\r\nsome  $190 million of which $172 million are still\r\n\r\noutstanding. The Government itself emerges  as  an\r\n\r\noverall creditor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assess the financial standing of the country\r\n\r\nas  a  whole, it is necessary to take into account\r\n\r\nnot  only  the resources of the central government\r\n\r\nbut  those  of the statutory bodies.  I  give  the\r\n\r\ntotal  investments held in funds under the control\r\n\r\nof   the  central  government  and  its  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies.

The  latest\r\n\r\nestimate  in  respect  of banks,  places  the  net\r\n\r\nassets   of   Singapore  banks  held  in   foreign\r\n\r\ncountries  at $325 million. In addition,  we  have\r\n\r\ntaken into account investments abroad by insurance\r\n\r\nfirms  operating  in  Singapore.  There  are  also\r\n\r\nforeign   investments  by  companies  and  private\r\n\r\nindividuals resident in Singapore. The figures for\r\n\r\nall these are not readily available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above account of our investments abroad does\r\n\r\nnot  take into consideration the currency  Reserve\r\n\r\nFunds.  These  funds,  of course,  do  not  belong\r\n\r\nsolely  to  Singapore. We  are  only  one  of  the\r\n\r\nparticipating    members    of    the    agreement\r\n\r\nestablishing the Currency Board, the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  North Borneo, Sarawak, and  Brunei  being\r\n\r\nthe other parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The currency reserves are considerable, the\r\n\r\nlatest figure being $1,110 million. All these  are\r\n\r\ninvested   abroad.  The  future  of  the  Currency\r\n\r\nAgreement   is   under  discussion   between   the\r\n\r\nparticipating countries, and I do not wish to  say\r\n\r\nmore about this. I am not saying that there is any\r\n\r\nneed  to take precipitate action to withdraw these\r\n\r\nfunds  abroad  for investment in Singapore.  There\r\n\r\nare advantages in holding investments abroad. From\r\n\r\nthe  Government point of View, funds  invested  in\r\n\r\nLondon  have the great advantage of liquidity.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt   similar   considerations   have   led   to\r\n\r\ninvestment of bank balances in London. These  bank\r\n\r\nbalances  are primarily used as a Reserve  Balance\r\n\r\nin  the  financing of our foreign trade,  and,  as\r\n\r\nsuch,  serve a valuable purpose. Considering  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's  imports and exports  totalled  $6,880\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1958, there is no ground for believing\r\n\r\nthat   these   bank  balances  held   abroad   are\r\n\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make this brief review of Singapore's overseas\r\n\r\nbalances  in  order to underline two  points.  The\r\n\r\nfirst is that, as a great trading centre, we are a\r\n\r\npart  of  the  world economy, and  have  important\r\n\r\nfinancial and economic links in many parts of  the\r\n\r\nworld.   Our   continued  prosperity  depends   on\r\n\r\nstrengthening these links, and if we disrupt these\r\n\r\nlinks, we do so at our own peril. The second point\r\n\r\nis  that  we  have invested large sums abroad.  In\r\n\r\nreturn, there has been a substantial investment of\r\n\r\nforeign capital in our country, though the  totals\r\n\r\nhave  not  been reliably computed.  It  is  almost\r\n\r\ncertain  that after taking these into account,  we\r\n\r\nemerge very much on the credit side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the end of World War II, it has become\r\n\r\nfashionable among the modern industrial nations of\r\n\r\nthe  world  to speak of the need to assist  under-developed  regions, especially by way  of  capital\r\n\r\ninvestment.  But in Singapore the relationship  is\r\n\r\nexactly  the reverse of what has now  come  to  be\r\n\r\naccepted  as normal. I do hope that when  we  have\r\n\r\noccasion  to ask for loans from abroad,  we  shall\r\n\r\nnot  be  treated as poor relatives  in  quest  for\r\n\r\nassistance,  for  our moral position  in  this  is\r\n\r\nsurely very strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES, 1959</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of\r\n\r\nSupply [1st Allotted Day].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister signify the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the Yang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara  before the Committee  proceeds\r\n\r\nwith the consideration of these Estimates?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> I so signify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Second Supplementary Estimates, 1959</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Second Supplementary Estimates of\r\n\r\nExpenditure  for 1959 (Paper Cmd.

That  was\r\n\r\nvery laudable, and the Government proceeded to  do\r\n\r\nit,  thereby  giving an indication to  the  public\r\n\r\nthat  the cost of ministerial Government certainly\r\n\r\nwas  going  to  be  reduced.  Let  us,  therefore,\r\n\r\nexamine that statement in the light of events that\r\n\r\nhave happened subsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now find that requests are being made for\r\n\r\nPolitical     Secretaries.    Beyond     Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries, Parliamentary Secretaries  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  appointed  to Ministries,  where  previously\r\n\r\nAssistant Ministers had not existed. I venture  to\r\n\r\nsuggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the total costs of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  together with their  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries and Political Secretaries - such  as  we\r\n\r\nknow  them - perhaps exceed the total cost  of  what\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  and  the Assistant  Ministers  had\r\n\r\npreviously  drawn - when I say  \"previously  drawn\",\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  I mean by Ministers  and  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters in the previous Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This appointment of Political Secretary is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  certainly is not  known  to  the\r\n\r\nConstitution of Singapore. Therefore, it would  be\r\n\r\ninteresting to find out what this appointment  is.\r\n\r\nFirstly, are these posts civil service posts? That\r\n\r\nis  the  first  question,  and  I  would  like  it\r\n\r\nanswered.  If they are civil service  posts,  have\r\n\r\nthese  appointments already been made? If  so,  by\r\n\r\nwhom? If they are not civil service posts, and  if\r\n\r\nthese appointments have already been made, who are\r\n\r\nthe  holders  of  these posts  and  whether  these\r\n\r\nholders  are members of the P.A.P. and  have  been\r\n\r\ngiven  these posts merely because they  have  been\r\n\r\nuseful to the Party in bringing them to power? And\r\n\r\nlastly,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I would like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether there are only three Political Secretaries\r\n\r\nattached  to  the three Ministries set  out  here,\r\n\r\nnamely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 7 Chief Minister/Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 1 item (33) Personal Secretary\r\n\r\n(Political).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 61 Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 1 item (3) Personal Secretary\r\n\r\n(Political), one ($1,400); one ($1,100).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor   the  Minister  for  Culture,  not  one,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  but  two  Political  Secretaries.\r\n\r\nUnder -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 62 Ministry of National Development\r\n\r\nSubhead    1   item   (3)   Personal   Secretary\r\n\r\n(Political).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  do  not  know whether there are other  Personal\r\n\r\nSecretaries  (Political)  attached  to  the  other\r\n\r\nMinistries, but these are the only posts which the\r\n\r\nHouse is aware of in these Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another curious feature of the Personal Secretary\r\n\r\n(Political) is that, as described here, the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister carries a Personal Secretary (Political),\r\n\r\nthe Minister for National Development also carries\r\n\r\na  Personal  Secretary  (Political),  whereas  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture carries two,  one  Personal\r\n\r\nSecretary  (Political) at $1,400 a  month,  and  a\r\n\r\nsecond Personal Secretary (Political) at $1,100  a\r\n\r\nmonth.  If they are given the value for the posts,\r\n\r\nI suppose the gentleman who is holding the post at\r\n\r\n$1,400  must  be  holding the more valuable  post.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  House  could  be  told  why  it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  if  at  all it is necessary,  to  have\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretaries,  that  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCulture should have two Personal Secretaries,  and\r\n\r\none at a rate which exceeds all the other Personal\r\n\r\nSecretaries by $300 a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is \"That the sum to be\r\n\r\nallocated for Head 7 be reduced by $10 in  respect\r\n\r\nof  item (33) of subhead 1 therein.\" As indicated,\r\n\r\nthe debate may range over Head 61, subhead 1, item\r\n\r\n(3) ,  Personal Secretary (Political), $17,500,  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  which  an amendment  appears  in  the\r\n\r\nSupplement to the Order Paper in the name  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 61 be\r\n\r\nreduced  by $10 in respect of item (3) of  subhead\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Similarly with regard to Head 62, subhead 1,  item (3).\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I must congratulate the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark for his ingenuity in calculating the costs of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent  Ministries  as  against  those   of   the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government, and coming to the  brilliant\r\n\r\nconclusion that we are costing the people more.

I  shall  not  anticipate  what   my\r\n\r\ncolleague  will  be  saying  when  he  moves   the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first delineate briefly the duties of the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary and the Personal Secretary\r\n\r\n(Political)?  Everybody knows what  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary  is supposed to do. His duties  are  set\r\n\r\nout in the Constitution itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary, as the term designates, carries the burden of the Minister's\r\n\r\nparliamentary duties, and to the extent  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  designates or delegates, he carries  the\r\n\r\nburden  of the Minister's ministerial duties.  The\r\n\r\nPersonal    Secretary    (Political)    has     no\r\n\r\nadministrative duties. He has no direct access  to\r\n\r\nthe Civil Service. He is a personal appointment of\r\n\r\nthe Minister, and his role is really that of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister's  closest  confidant  on  the  political\r\n\r\nimplications of the moves, plans and  policies  of\r\n\r\nthe various Ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that there have been three\r\n\r\nappointments, and that there will be three more in\r\n\r\nthe  near future. Ultimately, all the appointments\r\n\r\nwill be filled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, my own personal appointment. He is Mr\r\n\r\nJek.  The second is Mr Woodhull whose appointment\r\n\r\nis  Personal Secretary (Political) to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health. The third is Mr Rahim Ishak, who  is\r\n\r\nPersonal Secretary (Political) to the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture. They are, Mr Speaker, Sir, our political\r\n\r\nchiefs  of staff, so to speak, political  backroom\r\n\r\nboys,  the people who have the aptitude, the skill\r\n\r\nand touch in these matters which are of invaluable\r\n\r\nassistance, I hope, to all Ministers, to avoid the\r\n\r\nunnecessary  faux pas which would  otherwise  fall\r\n\r\ntheir  way  if the presentation and implementation\r\n\r\nof  policies  were  left  entirely  to  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows, therefore, that they are all\r\n\r\npolitical  appointments. I am unable to  enlighten\r\n\r\nthe  Member  on  the  actual  procedure  on  these\r\n\r\nappointments.  I shall leave that to  my  Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Finance,   who  is  more   acquainted   with\r\n\r\nestablishment matters. What it amounts to is this.\r\n\r\nThis   is   the   Minister's  Personal   Secretary\r\n\r\n(Political). It says what it means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say to the House that one of the problems\r\n\r\nwhich  this Government faces - and I have said  this\r\n\r\non   many  previous  occasions - is  not  only   the\r\n\r\ncarrying  out of our plans and policies, but  also\r\n\r\nthe  manner  and method of presentation  of  these\r\n\r\npolicies to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jek was a former newspaper man on a Chinese newspaper. He also went to gaol for some time in\r\n\r\n1957/1958  for  alleged subversive activities.  He\r\n\r\nwas  released,  presumably because the  Government\r\n\r\ndiscovered   that  the  allegation  of  subversive\r\n\r\nactivities  was unfounded. He is not the  type  of\r\n\r\nperson whom we would want to give a job to for the\r\n\r\nsake of rewarding him. If the last Government  had\r\n\r\na  fraction of the skill and devotion to duty, the\r\n\r\npolitical know-how that these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntypes  of  persons have, they would not have  come\r\n\r\nsuch miserable croppers as they did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are open political appointments, and I\r\n\r\nventure  to  suggest  that succeeding  governments\r\n\r\nwill  find  that  this  is  a  sound  and  healthy\r\n\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me just refer you to one instance of the kind of difficulties those people\r\n\r\nextricate us from. You will remember, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthat we were making arrangements for the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to deliver the first speech to this\r\n\r\nAssembly in Malay. The permanent staff was  there,\r\n\r\nthe  skilled translators in the former P.R.O. and\r\n\r\nthose  you had prudently recruited beforehand.  It\r\n\r\nwas a difficult first task - 18 pages of translation\r\n\r\nwere  almost unintelligible. But Mr Rahim  Ishak,\r\n\r\nwho  I hope will continue to give the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture  the political touch, was in the space  of\r\n\r\n24 hours able to reduce what was an unintelligible\r\n\r\nverbatim  translation into one which I hope  Malay\r\n\r\nMembers  on  the  other  side  will  agree  was  a\r\n\r\ncoherent  and  smooth passage from  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara in the national language.  He  was\r\n\r\nable to do that because, amongst other things,  he\r\n\r\nused to be the leader writer in the Utusan Melayu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I should like to draw the attention\r\n\r\nof the House to Head 61, subhead 1, item (3) which\r\n\r\nnow  reads  \"Personal Secretary  (Political),  one\r\n\r\n($1,400); one ($1,100).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry if I have slightly confused the Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park, but I think he will have a better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of what all this is about if  I  say\r\n\r\nthat  this does not reflect the staffing  position\r\n\r\nquite  accurately. It should now read,  \"Publicity\r\n\r\nLiaison   Secretary  (Political)   ($1,400),   and\r\n\r\nPersonal Secretary (Political) ($1,100)\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this new designation is to\r\n\r\nindicate  more precisely the functions of  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  Secretaries.  The post of  Publicity  Liaison\r\n\r\nSecretary   (Political)  is  also  an  appointment\r\n\r\npersonal  to the Minister, but it involves  duties\r\n\r\nand functions which are in some respects different\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom those of Personal Secretary (Political). When\r\n\r\nthe  Supplementary Estimates were  submitted,  the\r\n\r\npost  of  Publicity Liaison Secretary  (Political)\r\n\r\nwas   then   designated  as   Personal   Secretary\r\n\r\n(Political),  because  at that  time  it  was  not\r\n\r\npossible to define precisely the functions of many\r\n\r\nof  the  officials in the Ministry. As  you  know,\r\n\r\nSir, the Ministry of Culture is a new Ministry. It\r\n\r\nhas  to  be put together from scratch, and  it  is\r\n\r\nstill  today  in  the process of creation.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  not possible to predict in detail  what\r\n\r\nresponsibility would fall on what officer and what\r\n\r\nfunction they would be required to perform.  After\r\n\r\nall,   Mr  Speaker,  there  are  many  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  which  have  been  in  existence  for\r\n\r\nnearly a century, and there are officials who  are\r\n\r\nstill  not quite sure where they fit in, and  what\r\n\r\ntheir  precise  tasks  are.  Therefore,  when  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture, which is only  about  three\r\n\r\nmonths old, occasionally gives new designations to\r\n\r\none  officer, I do not think the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark should see anything more sinister in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Ministry of Culture is more or less\r\n\r\ncomplete,  the  need  for what  I  have  termed  a\r\n\r\nPublicity Liaison Secretary (Political) has become\r\n\r\nmore apparent. His functions are those imposed  by\r\n\r\nthe  very nature and structure of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture.  As  you  know, Sir, my  Ministry  is  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  a variety of publicity services - radio,\r\n\r\ninformation,  posters, films, publications  and  a\r\n\r\npublic  address system under which field  officers\r\n\r\ngo  out every day to broadcast necessary and vital\r\n\r\ninformation  to the public. This wide  variety  of\r\n\r\npublicity  services have not only to be  fed  with\r\n\r\nsuitable  materials but it is also necessary  that\r\n\r\nthey  function  as a co-ordinated  unit.  It  will\r\n\r\ntherefore be one of the functions of the Publicity\r\n\r\nLiaison  Secretary to see that there is  such  co-ordination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why my Ministry requires two appointments\r\n\r\nwhich  are  personal to the Minister,  here  again\r\n\r\nthey  are imposed by the very character, functions\r\n\r\nand  structure  of the Ministry of  Culture.  This\r\n\r\nMinistry is concerned with shaping people's  ideas\r\n\r\nand mental attitudes. To\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquote  from  the  speech of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara, one of the functions of this Ministry will\r\n\r\nbe  to  create \"a sense of national identity among\r\n\r\nthe various races in Malaya\" and \"to instil in our\r\n\r\npeople  of  all  races the will to be  a  nation\".\r\n\r\nThis,  therefore,  involves not only  taking  into\r\n\r\naccount  such things as sentiments, attitudes  and\r\n\r\nreactions  of  people  in  general  but  also  the\r\n\r\nattitudes, sentiments and reactions of the various\r\n\r\ncultural   and  racial  groups  in  this  country.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir, in the case of my  Ministry,  the\r\n\r\nbricks  and mortar with which this Ministry  works\r\n\r\nare  of  finer material than may be the case  with\r\n\r\nsome  other Ministries. In a multi-racial  society\r\n\r\nlike  ours,  it is necessary for this Ministry  to\r\n\r\nhave  people  who can advise it on the  political,\r\n\r\nsocial and cultural reactions of the various races\r\n\r\nand  communities in Singapore. Therefore,  one  of\r\n\r\nthese posts requires someone with a knowledge  not\r\n\r\nonly  of  the Chinese language but also of Chinese\r\n\r\ntrends, thought and reactions and also a knowledge\r\n\r\nof   (on  the  purely  technical  side)  publicity\r\n\r\nmethods and organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other post requires someone with a knowledge\r\n\r\nof the Malay language and Malay thought, reactions\r\n\r\nand  attitudes. In view of this, I feel, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthere  is  every  justification  for  having   two\r\n\r\npolitical secretaries because they will guide this\r\n\r\nMinistry  which deals mainly with ideas, attitudes\r\n\r\nand  sentiments, to gauge accurately reactions  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  measures or Government  programmes  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of these communities. I am  quite  sure\r\n\r\nthat  if, as the Prime Minister mentioned earlier,\r\n\r\nthe  previous  Government had a  little  bit  more\r\n\r\nforesight  in  this matter and not  felt  its  own\r\n\r\npulse  and  mistaken it for the  pulse  of  public\r\n\r\nopinion, it would not be where it is today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I want to make one point in\r\n\r\nfurther elucidation which I had taken for granted,\r\n\r\nwhen I first stood up to speak on this motion.  It\r\n\r\nis  this: that every act of the Government  is  in\r\n\r\nfact  being  interpreted in four different  worlds\r\n\r\nand, very often, with four different results:  the\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking world, the Malay-speaking  world,\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndian-speaking  world  and  the  English-speaking\r\n\r\nworld.  And  we  have as yet no  Minister  who  is\r\n\r\neducated to straddle all these four worlds.  Quite\r\n\r\na  number  of  my Ministers are ambidextrous,  who\r\n\r\nhave  been  educated in more than one  world.  The\r\n\r\nappointment of political secretaries is to make up\r\n\r\nthis deficiency. I am English-educated. Sometimes,\r\n\r\nan  act  which to the English-educated temper  and\r\n\r\nreaction may sound reasonable, correct and proper,\r\n\r\nmay  require some amendments in order that it  can\r\n\r\nbe equally welcomed by the Chinese-educated world.\r\n\r\nHence  the  appointment of my political  secretary\r\n\r\nwho  is  a  man well conversant with  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nworld. In the case of the Minister for Health,  he\r\n\r\nis   Malay-educated  and  his  appointment  is  to\r\n\r\ncompensate  for his lack of touch of the  English-speaking world with which he has a great  deal  to\r\n\r\ndo in his Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague the Minister for Culture has said, a\r\n\r\nnew Malayan culture will be built basically around\r\n\r\nthe  Malay language and it was essential  that  he\r\n\r\nshould   have   someone   who   has   the    right\r\n\r\nunderstanding    of   the   reaction    and    the\r\n\r\nsusceptibilities  and  the sentiments,  the  whole\r\n\r\npolitical  and philosophical outlook of the  Malay\r\n\r\npeople.  This  is  a  factor  which  we  must  all\r\n\r\nremember.   If  a  government  wishes  to   govern\r\n\r\neffectively  with the support of the people,  then\r\n\r\nthat  is  a government whose every action must  be\r\n\r\njudged as successful not only in one world, but in\r\n\r\nfour  worlds.  I hope that distributed  among  the\r\n\r\neight  Ministries  there will be enough  political\r\n\r\ntalent  to  keep  us  in touch with  all  possible\r\n\r\nsusceptibilities,  moods and tempers  of  all  the\r\n\r\nworlds  that  we have to face in our multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual and multi-cultural society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all I\r\n\r\nwelcome the Prime Minister's statement that  these\r\n\r\nPersonal  Secretaries  (Political)  will  have  no\r\n\r\ndirect access to the permanent Civil Service. I am\r\n\r\nmuch  obliged  to  him for making  that  statement\r\n\r\nquite  categorically  without any  qualifications.\r\n\r\nThe  statement, as I understand it,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, means this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat  in so far as the Civil Service is concerned,\r\n\r\nthe  Political Secretaries will not interfere, and\r\n\r\nthat any interference with the civil servants will\r\n\r\nbe   from   the  Minister  through  his  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it will be a sad day for Singapore\r\n\r\nif   the  Political  Secretaries  take  over   the\r\n\r\ndepartments rather than the Permanent Secretaries,\r\n\r\nwho  are  directly  responsible  to  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself.  One must always keep in mind that  these\r\n\r\nare political appointments and, as such, they must\r\n\r\ninevitably be given to persons who are high in the\r\n\r\nesteem  of  the  Party in power and  who  possibly\r\n\r\nhelped  to put that Party in power. That  is  what\r\n\r\nstrikes   me   as  being  dangerous  about   these\r\n\r\nappointments, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sympathise with the Prime Minister and the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  of his Government in a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety. I appreciate his statement that what  may\r\n\r\nseem right to the English-speaking groups may  not\r\n\r\nseem so right to the Chinese-speaking groups,  and\r\n\r\nso  with the Tamil-speaking groups and the  Malay-speaking groups. Perhaps if the former Government,\r\n\r\nas  he  says, Sir, were as alive to it as his  own\r\n\r\nGovernment is, they might not have been where they\r\n\r\nare today. There may be something in that too, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir. But, the point of the statement  of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister is this. His proud  boast  to\r\n\r\nthis  House and to everyone outside is this.  That\r\n\r\nhis  Party is deeply rooted in the masses  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,    his    Ministers,   his   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries, his Assemblymen, they are all deeply,\r\n\r\ninevitably and inextricably rooted in the  masses.\r\n\r\nIf  that  proud  boast is true, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  is the point in all these appointments? Each\r\n\r\nMinister,  as  I  understand  it,  has   his   own\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary. May I  congratulate  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister on the way in which  he  has  made\r\n\r\nthese  appointments  of  Parliamentary  Secretary?\r\n\r\nWhere he has an English-educated Minister, he  has\r\n\r\nvery  thoughtfully  put a Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nwhose education is derived not through English.  A\r\n\r\nvery  sensible and, if I may be permitted  to  say\r\n\r\nso, a very good idea. He has therefore distributed\r\n\r\nthroughout his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistries  persons  who  deeply  understand   the\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking   groups,  the   Chinese-speaking\r\n\r\ngroups, the Indian-speaking groups and the  Malay-speaking  groups.  Now, if he has  among  his  own\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  his Parliamentary Secretaries,  16\r\n\r\npersons   to   understand  the  four   trends   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I again  ask  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister what is the necessity  for  making\r\n\r\nthese  political  appointments, unless  it  is  to\r\n\r\ndistribute largesse to people who have put him  in\r\n\r\npower?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are\r\n\r\nnowhere near the American spoils system yet, but I\r\n\r\nwould suggest to the Member that if it is largesse\r\n\r\nthat  we  wish to distribute, there are much  more\r\n\r\nconvenient   and   less   conspicuous   ways    of\r\n\r\ndistributing it among the victors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to him that when we say\r\n\r\nour  Party-we are, basically, modest men by nature\r\n\r\nand we do not say each individual is rooted in the\r\n\r\nmasses-we  mean that collectively as a  Party,  we\r\n\r\nare  rooted in every section, every sector,  every\r\n\r\nstream of opinion and thought of this society. All\r\n\r\nthe appointments are, of course, appointments made\r\n\r\nfrom those who are very close to the Party. I have\r\n\r\nnot  the  slightest compunction in  persisting  in\r\n\r\nsaying that my Party is rooted in the people. Each\r\n\r\nand  everyone  of the political secretaries,  when\r\n\r\nthey are appointed and those who have already been\r\n\r\nappointed, is rooted in the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should we have more talent at our disposal?\r\n\r\nWhy  not? We have got the talent and we intend  to\r\n\r\nuse  it. If the Member for Farrer Park and his old\r\n\r\ncolleagues  who  have  now  disappeared  from  the\r\n\r\npolitical  scene,  had won  in  the  1955  general\r\n\r\nelections  (I  heard a great deal of  their  plans\r\n\r\nwhen  they were planning to get into office  then)\r\n\r\nthey  would have had nothing else other than  they\r\n\r\nthemselves. They have no talent and no  background\r\n\r\nto fall back on.

These appointments are not\r\n\r\nprimarily  made for the benefit of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  but  for the benefit  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party, so that during these five years,  a\r\n\r\nline  of propaganda will be let out on the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore which will enable the Party to  come\r\n\r\nback at the end of five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Therefore, if the main underlying motive in\r\n\r\nthese  appointments is to bring  the  P.A.P. back\r\n\r\ninto  power  at  the next elections,  why  do  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. not  pay for them themselves?

These posts have to  be\r\n\r\npaid for out of public funds and public funds  are\r\n\r\nnot yet P.A.P. funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the point raised by the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is that by a dexterous\r\n\r\nchange  of  name, the P.A.P. Government  seeks  to\r\n\r\nmake a rose into something else. He said that  the\r\n\r\nfirst  post  is not Personal Secretary (Political)\r\n\r\nbut  Publicity Liaison Officer (Political).  As  I\r\n\r\nunderstood it from the Prime Minister, the purpose\r\n\r\nof  these  appointments was to keep the Government\r\n\r\nin touch with the people. This does not seem to be\r\n\r\nvery  different  from  Publicity  Liaison  Officer\r\n\r\n(Political).  It seems to mean the same  thing  to\r\n\r\nme.  I  do  not know how the Minister for  Culture\r\n\r\nseeks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   draw   a   distinction  between   these   two\r\n\r\nappointments.  The  post  of  Personal   Secretary\r\n\r\n(Political) is exactly the same as the post which,\r\n\r\nin his Ministry, is going to carry $1,400 a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nimpliedly made is that one post is to contact  the\r\n\r\nChinese  masses and the other post is  to  contact\r\n\r\nthe  Malay-speaking  group.  I  hope  I  have  not\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  him but that was the  impression  I\r\n\r\ngot  when he was speaking. If it is publicity  and\r\n\r\nputting over the policy of the Government  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore that is the vital purpose  of\r\n\r\nthis  appointment, probably the  other  Ministries\r\n\r\nalso  need  two Personal Secretaries  (Political):\r\n\r\none to get at the Chinese masses and the other  to\r\n\r\nget at the Malay-speaking group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still feel, Mr Speaker, Sir, that these\r\n\r\nappointments are not for the benefit of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  but  are largely intended  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the Party in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, may I just make\r\n\r\nthis  observation?

Now, this Progressive Party,\r\n\r\nwhich  has transformed itself into different names\r\n\r\nand under different guises, found it necessary  to\r\n\r\nacquire experts to give them political advice  and\r\n\r\nthey  duly  appointed  an English  woman  who  was\r\n\r\nformerly  a  member of the Liberal  Party  or  the\r\n\r\nConservative Party - I forgot which.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Liberal-National.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The result was that the\r\n\r\nProgressive Party came a hideous cropper and, true\r\n\r\nto form, changed its name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when we consider this whole problem of why our standards are more exacting than the\r\n\r\nstandards to which the Member for Farrer Park  has\r\n\r\nbeen  accustomed, I can assure you  that  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of  what he has said on the subject  is  not\r\n\r\nonly  irrelevant  but,  if  listened  to  by   any\r\n\r\ngovernment in this country, would lead it  rapidly\r\n\r\nto its ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after listening\r\n\r\nto  the  Member for Farrer Park, I  think  that  I\r\n\r\nshould   let   loose   our  Personal   Secretaries\r\n\r\n(Political) on him, because I am quite  sure  that\r\n\r\nafter half an hour he will understand why we  need\r\n\r\nPersonal Secretaries (Political) to help us in our\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also claimed that my Ministry has merely\r\n\r\nchanged  the  name of one Personal Secretary  into\r\n\r\nPublicity Liaison Secretary (Political)  in  order\r\n\r\nto  make  the  whole  thing  smell  a  little  bit\r\n\r\nsweeter.

But  I\r\n\r\nthink  I  have  explained quite clearly  that  the\r\n\r\nPublicity   Liaison   Secretary   (Political)   is\r\n\r\ninvolved  in certain technical functions connected\r\n\r\nwith   publicity,  that  is,  radio,  information,\r\n\r\nposters, films, and so on. At the same time, it is\r\n\r\nessential that whatever information is put over at\r\n\r\nany  one  time  should  be properly  co-ordinated,\r\n\r\nunlike the previous Government which used to speak\r\n\r\nwith different voices. We are interested in seeing\r\n\r\nthat  at  least we speak with one voice  and  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  we  put  over is properly  co-ordinated,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  one  section of  the  publicity  unit\r\n\r\nconflicting with another section of our  publicity\r\n\r\nunit. Sir, it is a skilled technical function,  to\r\n\r\nbe   able   to   co-ordinate  radio,  information,\r\n\r\nposters, films, and so on, and that is why one  of\r\n\r\nthe  Secretaries  is  called a  Publicity  Liaison\r\n\r\nSecretary (Political). The job is more responsible\r\n\r\nand  the  officer  therefore  is  entitled  to   a\r\n\r\nslightly   higher  remuneration  than  the   other\r\n\r\nSecretary  whose  functions  do  not  involve  any\r\n\r\ntechnical  tasks connected with the  co-ordination\r\n\r\nof publicity services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I would lice to assure the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture that I now  understand  why\r\n\r\nthis  gentleman with more technical qualifications\r\n\r\nand  holding  a  more complicated  designation  is\r\n\r\ndrawing  $300 more a month than the other  officer\r\n\r\nwho is just a trained man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the statement of the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  he  has   entirely\r\n\r\nsupported my point, if I may say so with  respect,\r\n\r\nwhen  he said that when the Progressive Party made\r\n\r\nan   appointment,  that  was  paid  out   of   the\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party  funds, not out  of  Government\r\n\r\nfunds.

Some  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers on the Government side of the  House  who\r\n\r\nhave been  co-opted  into  the  various   Select\r\n\r\nCommittees are unable to follow the proceedings as\r\n\r\nexpeditiously as they otherwise  would,  if  they\r\n\r\nunderstood a  certain amount of English,  and  if\r\n\r\nthey were  able to read a certain amount  of  the\r\n\r\nMinutes without having to get it  translated  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time I suggest that perhaps Members\r\n\r\non the  Opposition side will  join  some  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers on the Government side, who are  English-speaking, in  trying  to  master  the   national\r\n\r\nlanguage. On  the Government side, Sir,  we  hope\r\n\r\nthat before three years you will be able to  join\r\n\r\nus in a debate in the Malay language. And if  the\r\n\r\nMembers from the S.P.A. - these three who obviously\r\n\r\ndo not seem to be in need of any moral rearmament,\r\n\r\nappearing to be sufficiently sturdy to  withstand\r\n\r\nthe misfortunes   that   have   befallen   their\r\n\r\ncolleagues - could make the  effort,  perhaps  even\r\n\r\nthey might  survive, as the appendix survives  in\r\n\r\nthe human being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules and regulations are being framed. The only\r\n\r\nreason why  the Member for Farrer  Park  has  not\r\n\r\nheard about them is because of the difficulty  of\r\n\r\ntrying to  formulate rules. I have the rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations for the civil service  to  use  as  a\r\n\r\nmodel. To make sure that the facilities are  being\r\n\r\nproperly used and not wasted - e.g. when the teacher\r\n\r\ncomes he  finds the pupils absent, and the  State\r\n\r\nloses funds - there will be periodic tests  to  see\r\n\r\nthat progress is being made. In the  examinations\r\n\r\nnext year, I even hope to follow the civil service\r\n\r\nprocedure and give a bonus where a bonus  is  due.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is to find a uniform  examination,\r\n\r\nbecause the standards of the 51 Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly vary.

It will enable a Criminal\r\n\r\nDistrict Court to deal with all offences which are\r\n\r\npunishable  with a fine only or  with  a  term  of\r\n\r\nimprisonment not exceeding seven years,  and  also\r\n\r\nwith  certain offences punishable with  a  heavier\r\n\r\nSentence  which are made punishable by a  Criminal\r\n\r\nDistrict Court in Schedule A to the Code, and also\r\n\r\npower  is given to a Criminal District Court  with\r\n\r\nthe  consent  of  the  Public Prosecutor  and  the\r\n\r\naccused  to  deal with all cases other than  those\r\n\r\npunishable with death or imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers of the Criminal District Court are\r\n\r\nincreased to enable it to impose imprisonment  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  three  years, or a fine  not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$5,000, or to pass a sentence of caning up  to  12\r\n\r\nstrokes,  and  to impose sentences  of  corrective\r\n\r\ntraining  and preventive detention. In appropriate\r\n\r\ncases,  as  when  an accused person  has  previous\r\n\r\nconvictions, the Criminal District Court may  pass\r\n\r\nsentences of imprisonment up to seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the jurisdiction of\r\n\r\nthe  Magistrate's  Court  has  been  increased  to\r\n\r\nenable  it  to  deal with all offences  which  are\r\n\r\npunishable  with a fine only or  with  a  term  of\r\n\r\nimprisonment  not  exceeding  three   years.   The\r\n\r\nMagistrate's Court is also given power  to  impose\r\n\r\nsentences of imprisonment not exceeding one  year,\r\n\r\na  fine not exceeding $2,000 and caning up to  six\r\n\r\nstrokes,  and  in appropriate cases,  as  when  an\r\n\r\naccused  person has previous convictions,  it  can\r\n\r\naward  the full punishment for an offence  triable\r\n\r\nby it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions generally follow the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the Federation Criminal Procedure Code and the\r\n\r\nCourts  Ordinance relating to the  powers  of  the\r\n\r\nSessions Court and the Magistrate's Court.  It  is\r\n\r\nfurther   considered,  Mr  Speaker,  that   these\r\n\r\nprovisions  will enable a large number  of  cases,\r\n\r\nwhich  are at present tried in the High Court,  to\r\n\r\nbe tried in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Criminal District Court, and they will result\r\n\r\nnot  only  in a saving of time of the High  Court,\r\n\r\nbut  also, by reason of the fact that it will  not\r\n\r\nbe  necessary  to hold preliminary  inquiries,  it\r\n\r\nwill   result  in  the  saving  of  time  of   the\r\n\r\nMagistrate's Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks to\r\n\r\nmake  admissible caution statements to the Police.\r\n\r\nThe Police in Singapore have complained for a long\r\n\r\ntime that the results of their work are restricted\r\n\r\nby the provisions which forbid statements recorded\r\n\r\nby  them,  even  if taken in compliance  with  the\r\n\r\nJudges' Rules in England, which provide safeguards\r\n\r\nagainst  statements extorted by force or  threats,\r\n\r\nto be given in evidence in the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hongkong and Sarawak, the English practice in\r\n\r\nthis  respect  is  followed, and although  in  the\r\n\r\nearlier stages the Police investigators there made\r\n\r\nthe  mistake of relying on obtaining a  confession\r\n\r\nto  prove a case, the practice has, I am  glad  to\r\n\r\nsay,  since  worked very well. The  experience  in\r\n\r\nHongkong  has shown that Police investigators  can\r\n\r\nlearn, by training and experience, the proper  use\r\n\r\nof the Judges' Rules, and that the possible abuses\r\n\r\nof  the  admissibility  of caution  statements  in\r\n\r\nevidence can be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statements and confessions can be challenged\r\n\r\nin  Court  on the ground that they were improperly\r\n\r\ntaken,  and  the Court can always  rule  out  such\r\n\r\nevidence if the rules are not observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nstatements  made  to  police  officers   be   made\r\n\r\nadmissible  in Court subject to the safeguards  as\r\n\r\nimposed  in England. The amendment to the Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure Code which will effect this is  set  out\r\n\r\nin   clause   15  of  the  Bill.  A  consequential\r\n\r\namendment  will  also  have  to  be  made  in  the\r\n\r\nEvidence Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England and Hongkong, there are no\r\n\r\nrestrictions  in  regard to  the  rank  of  police\r\n\r\nofficer to whom the statements are made, and  such\r\n\r\ncaution statements made to any police officer  are\r\n\r\nadmissible  in evidence. It is proposed,  however,\r\n\r\nthat, as a start in Singapore, only statements  to\r\n\r\npolice  officers not below the rank  of  Inspector\r\n\r\nwill be admissible in evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term \"Inspector\" has been defined to include\r\n\r\na  cadet  inspector, but the effect will  be  that\r\n\r\nstatements  made to the ordinary police constables\r\n\r\nor  corporals or sergeants will not be  admissible\r\n\r\nin evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government realises that there is a risk in\r\n\r\nthe  admission of caution statements,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nfelt  that  it  would  be better  to  confine  the\r\n\r\nadmissibility of such statements to those made  to\r\n\r\npolice officers of and above the rank of Inspector\r\n\r\nwho  are,  on  the  whole,  better  educated  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   more   likely   to   understand   the\r\n\r\nprinciples and application of the Judges' Rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto in Singapore where caution statements to\r\n\r\npolice  officers  have  been  made  admissible  in\r\n\r\nevidence  as,  for example, under the Preservation\r\n\r\nof   Public   Security   Ordinance,   1955,   only\r\n\r\nstatements  made to police officers of  and  above\r\n\r\nthe  rank of Inspector are made admissible. If and\r\n\r\nwhen  it  appears  that the higher  ranks  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force have learned the proper use  of  the\r\n\r\nJudges'  Rules, and are able to direct  and  guide\r\n\r\nthe  lower ranks of the Police, consideration will\r\n\r\nlikewise then be given to removing the restriction\r\n\r\nin  regard  to the rank of the police officers  to\r\n\r\nwhom the statements are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is recognised that the\r\n\r\ngreatest  care  would have to be  taken  to  avoid\r\n\r\nencouraging  an  attitude  of  mind  among  police\r\n\r\nofficers  which  tended to rely on confessions  to\r\n\r\nthe  detriment  of  other  available  evidence  in\r\n\r\nsupport of the prosecution. Control or supervision\r\n\r\nwould  remain in the hands of senior officers  who\r\n\r\nare  fully  aware that it would be detrimental  to\r\n\r\nthe Force and prosecutions in Court if confessions\r\n\r\nwere   sought   to  be  adduced  in  evidence   in\r\n\r\ncircumstances  where the voluntary nature  was  in\r\n\r\ndoubt.  It  is  appreciated  that  there  may   be\r\n\r\ndifficulties over language barriers; for instance,\r\n\r\nif  the accused speaks only a Chinese dialect  and\r\n\r\nthe  constable who arrests him speaks only  Malay.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties are not likely to disappear for\r\n\r\nmany years and it will always be for the Court  to\r\n\r\ndecide   in   any  individual  case  whether   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances justify the evidence to be  admitted\r\n\r\nor not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the third amendment proposed by\r\n\r\nthe  Bill relates to trial by jury. It is proposed\r\n\r\nthat  following the practice in the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, trial by jury be normally only required in\r\n\r\ncases  where the punishment authorised by  law  is\r\n\r\ndeath.  In  all other cases of trial in  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt,  the  trial will be by a Judge alone.  This\r\n\r\nwill appear to be a fundamental change in the  law\r\n\r\nand  Opposition  Members may shed tears  over  the\r\n\r\npassing  of  the English institution of  trial  by\r\n\r\njury.  Even  in  England, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\ninstitution  of  trial  by jury  has  not  escaped\r\n\r\ncriticism  from  such  legal  authorities  as  Dr\r\n\r\nGlanville  Williams. In the independent  State  of\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  of  Malaya,  a   committee   was\r\n\r\nappointed   to  consider  the  matter   and   this\r\n\r\ncommittee recommended the introduction of trial by\r\n\r\njury only in capital cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments will undoubtedly speed up\r\n\r\ntrials  in  the High Court. Although it  might  be\r\n\r\nsaid  that the proposals imply a distrust  of  the\r\n\r\njury  system,  they  undoubtedly  show  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has full confidence in the ability  and\r\n\r\ncompetence  of  our  Judges  to  deal  with   such\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the provisions in the Federation,\r\n\r\npower  is  given in the law to the Chief  Justice,\r\n\r\nwith  the approval of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,\r\n\r\nto  order that the trial of all offences or of any\r\n\r\nparticular type of offences before the High  Court\r\n\r\nshall  be  by jury. If it should therefore  appear\r\n\r\ndesirable in the future to extend trial by jury to\r\n\r\nother  than  capital cases this can be done  after\r\n\r\nconsultation   between  the  Chief  Justice,   the\r\n\r\nCabinet  and the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. I  should\r\n\r\nlike,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in this  connection,  to\r\n\r\nquote the following summary of the recommendations\r\n\r\nof the Law Commission of India which was set up in\r\n\r\n1955,  under  the  chairmanship of  the  Attorney-General of India. This is what the Commission  has\r\n\r\nto say on the jury system in India:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The jury system is time consuming and expensive.\r\n\r\nIt  is difficult to find jurors of the right  type\r\n\r\nand  such  jurors as are generally  available  are\r\n\r\neasily  approachable and can  be  moved  by  extra\r\n\r\njudicial consideration. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem  which  has had a long trial in  India  has\r\n\r\nbeen a failure and therefore should be abolished.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the committee stage of this\r\n\r\nBill, I propose to introduce the insertion of  two\r\n\r\nnew clauses in the Bill to provide that where,  in\r\n\r\na trial by jury of a person charged with a capital\r\n\r\noffence, the jury returns a verdict of not  guilty\r\n\r\nand  the  accused  is discharged,  the  Judge  may\r\n\r\nconvict  the  accused of a minor offence  or  some\r\n\r\nother  offence if he is satisfied from  the  facts\r\n\r\nthat  the accused is guilty of such offence.  This\r\n\r\namendment  will have the effect of  confining  the\r\n\r\njury's  verdict  only to the  capital  charge  for\r\n\r\nwhich the accused is tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill makes a\r\n\r\nnumber  of minor amendments to improve the  system\r\n\r\nof  criminal procedure. Provision is made for  the\r\n\r\nservice  of summonses to witnesses issued  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Power  is  given  to  the  Court,  in\r\n\r\nsentencing  an accused person, to take account  of\r\n\r\noutstanding  offences  against  him.   The   power\r\n\r\nauthorising    police    officers    to    conduct\r\n\r\ninvestigations  is  extended  to  enable  suitable\r\n\r\nofficers even below the rank of corporal to be  so\r\n\r\nempowered.  The  word \"caning\" is substituted  for\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"whipping\". The offence of cheating  is\r\n\r\nmade  a  seizable  offence, and  the  offences  of\r\n\r\ncausing  grievous hurt, voluntarily  causing  hurt\r\n\r\nwith  a  dangerous weapon, and voluntarily causing\r\n\r\ngrievous hurt with a dangerous weapon are made non-compoundable.  A  police  officer  conducting   an\r\n\r\ninvestigation into a seizable case is empowered to\r\n\r\nsearch the house of an arrested person, and  power\r\n\r\nis  also  given to a police officer not below  the\r\n\r\nrank  of  inspector to search  a  house  where  he\r\n\r\nsuspects the person is being confined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill seeks to\r\n\r\nalter  a  number  of things which have  long  been\r\n\r\nestablished  as part and parcel of our  system  of\r\n\r\ncriminal justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the first point mentioned by the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Law, that the Bill  seeks\r\n\r\nto give wider powers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the District Court and the Police Court, I have\r\n\r\nnothing  to  say, except that where  the  District\r\n\r\nCourts  and  the  Police Courts are  given  powers\r\n\r\nwhich  are  now exercisable by the High Court,  it\r\n\r\nfollows  that the District Courts and  the  Police\r\n\r\nCourts should be strengthened. There seems to be a\r\n\r\ntendency  in  the District Courts  and  the  lower\r\n\r\ncourts for a weakening rather than a strengthening\r\n\r\nof  these  Courts.  In  the  context  of  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening  in  the lower courts  at  South  Bridge\r\n\r\nRoad,  I  view  with  some  alarm  the  giving  of\r\n\r\nextended and extensive powers to the lower courts.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr Speaker, Sir, everything being equal,\r\n\r\nI  would myself say that taking away some  of  the\r\n\r\nexclusive  jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court  and\r\n\r\npassing it over to the lower courts (that is,  the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Court and Police Court) is a good  thing\r\n\r\nin itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important point which the Bill deals\r\n\r\nwith  is  trial by jury. The Minister for Law  has\r\n\r\ncited  Mr  Glanville Williams  as  a  person  who\r\n\r\ndisagrees with the jury system. He is no doubt  an\r\n\r\neminent  lecturer  and,  like  all  lecturers  and\r\n\r\ntheorists, he has his ideas and views of what  the\r\n\r\ncriminal  law should be and how it should develop.\r\n\r\nBut,  if  I  may  say  so, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nconsensus  of opinion among practising  barristers\r\n\r\nin  the United Kingdom is that trial by jury is  a\r\n\r\nsystem which should not be scoffed at and disposed\r\n\r\nof  lightly,  as it is intended to  do  here  this\r\n\r\nafternoon. The system of trial by jury has been in\r\n\r\nforce in Singapore since criminal law was enforced\r\n\r\nunder the Criminal Procedure Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our code, Mr Speaker, is derived from the Indian\r\n\r\nCode  and, although the Indian Code did not permit\r\n\r\na  number  of  things which we have  followed,  it\r\n\r\ninstituted the system of trial by jury in the High\r\n\r\nCourt.  The  quotation by the  Hon.  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Law of a statement by the chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  1955  Commission, or Committee, investigating\r\n\r\nthe  criminal law in India may perhaps be true  in\r\n\r\nthe  light  of  events that have  taken  place  in\r\n\r\nIndia. It could well be that the jurors are easily\r\n\r\naccessible  there and possibly it is a  matter  of\r\n\r\npublic knowledge that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njurors  are easily accessible. Possibly in  India,\r\n\r\nthe  system  of  trial by jury is held  in  public\r\n\r\ncontempt.  And  when a system of criminal  law  is\r\n\r\nheld  in public contempt then, of course, it  must\r\n\r\nbe changed because, in order to uphold the rule of\r\n\r\nlaw,  it  is vital that the processes whereby  the\r\n\r\nrule  of law is upheld should be held high in  the\r\n\r\nesteem  of  the public. It could well be  that  in\r\n\r\nIndia  trial  by  jury  is  discredited.  But  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, with respect, I have not  heard  it\r\n\r\nsaid in Singapore that the system of trial by jury\r\n\r\nis  disadvantageous to the public. There has  been\r\n\r\nno  suggestion  that  our  jurors  here  could  be\r\n\r\ntampered with or could be reached. Sometimes it is\r\n\r\nsaid that the jury has brought in a wrong verdict.\r\n\r\nBut  that,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nopinion. Whether they, the jury, have brought in a\r\n\r\nwrong verdict or not is a matter of opinion. Crown\r\n\r\ncounsel  invariably thinks that the wrong  verdict\r\n\r\nhas  been brought in when an acquittal is  awarded\r\n\r\nby  the  jury.  And, similarly,  counsel  for  the\r\n\r\naccused  usually thinks that a wrong  verdict  has\r\n\r\nbeen  brought  in when his client has  been  found\r\n\r\nguilty. But those are matters of opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trial by jury, Mr Speaker, Sir, has this\r\n\r\nadvantage,  that it distributes the responsibility\r\n\r\nfor   conviction  on  a  number  of  persons.  The\r\n\r\nprosecutor  presents  his  case  as  best  he  can\r\n\r\nobjectively.  The  defence  counsel  defends   his\r\n\r\nclient  as permitted to him by the ethics  of  his\r\n\r\nprofession and according to law. The judge  merely\r\n\r\nsums up the facts as have been adduced before him.\r\n\r\nThe  jury  takes the responsibility for convicting\r\n\r\non    the   facts   placed   before   them.    The\r\n\r\nresponsibility   for   conviction    is    equally\r\n\r\ndistributed between three or four separate  groups\r\n\r\nof  persons.  It has been a system which  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen found lacking. As far as I know, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  there has been no complaint that the  system\r\n\r\nof  criminal  law in Singapore is  failing  merely\r\n\r\nbecause  trial by jury is being employed. Where  a\r\n\r\nsystem  has been found to be effective and working\r\n\r\nwithin  reason,  then one should not  change  that\r\n\r\nsystem for the sake of merely changing it. One\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  have adequate reasons for changing it either\r\n\r\nin the light of developments or of conditions that\r\n\r\nexist in Singapore itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mr Speaker, Sir, the last point on which I\r\n\r\nwish to touch is this complete departure from  our\r\n\r\nconception  of  the admission of evidence  in  our\r\n\r\nCourts.  It is not without reason that the  Indian\r\n\r\nCriminal  Procedure Code says that  any  statement\r\n\r\nmade  by  any person who subsequently  becomes  an\r\n\r\naccused person, particularly if that statement  is\r\n\r\nmade  to a police officer, should be inadmissible.\r\n\r\nNow  the Indian Criminal Procedure Code was  drawn\r\n\r\nup  by  eminent  jurists  from  England  and  they\r\n\r\ndevised a system of law which was suitable to  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of the country having regard to the ability\r\n\r\nof  that country to work that particular system of\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in a multi-racial society such as we have in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I think  it  is  an\r\n\r\nunwise  step to change the existing provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Criminal Procedure Code which disentitle  the\r\n\r\npolice  to allow statements of accused persons  to\r\n\r\nbe put in evidence against the accused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore, police\r\n\r\ninvestigations do not solve all crimes brought  to\r\n\r\nthe notice of the police. The majority of cases in\r\n\r\nSingapore are solved through information given  to\r\n\r\nthe  police  by  outsiders  whose  names  are  not\r\n\r\nrevealed or brought out in court, or through  work\r\n\r\ndone  by  detectives at the lower  levels.  It  is\r\n\r\npublic  knowledge, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that  these\r\n\r\ndetectives are recruited on the basis  of  `Set  a\r\n\r\nthief to catch a thief.' That is public knowledge.\r\n\r\nThey  do  not  exactly come from  the  law-abiding\r\n\r\nclasses.   Most  of  the  detectives   have   been\r\n\r\nrecruited  from  groups of persons who  themselves\r\n\r\nhave  once indulged in criminal activities or have\r\n\r\nbeen  in  very close contact with those  who  have\r\n\r\nindulged  or are indulging in such activities.  It\r\n\r\nis through these two means that crime in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  mostly  solved.  I  venture  to  suggest,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that in the circumstances  here  it\r\n\r\nwould be highly unwise to bring in an amendment of\r\n\r\nthis nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section as drafted is very wide and gives\r\n\r\npowers  to  the  police to bring in any  statement\r\n\r\nbrought  to  the  knowledge of a  police  officer,\r\n\r\nwhether that statement has been interpreted to him\r\n\r\nby  any police officer or any person concerned  or\r\n\r\nnot  in  the  arrest.  Now  it  is  a  fundamental\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  the  law as we  now  know  it,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that in any translation which  seeks\r\n\r\nto  lay  the  blame on the accused, the translator\r\n\r\nshould not be a person who should be interested in\r\n\r\nthe  arrest  or  in the furnishing of  information\r\n\r\nwhich   brings  about  the  arrest.  That   is   a\r\n\r\nfundamental principle of the law recognised by the\r\n\r\ncourts  of  law  here. Now, that is  sound  common\r\n\r\nsense,  Mr Speaker, Sir, because where everything\r\n\r\ndepends  upon the interpretation then if a  person\r\n\r\nis interested in the arrest of a culprit it is not\r\n\r\nimprobable  that  the  interpretation   might   be\r\n\r\nslightly  tinged  in favour of  bringing  about  a\r\n\r\nconviction against the accused person.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nsay that it will happen in all cases but the risk,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, is so great that it would be  highly\r\n\r\nunwise - nay,   dangerous - to   bring   about    this\r\n\r\namendment  at  the present stage. I  dare  say  in\r\n\r\nHongkong   it  is  possible  because  in  Hongkong\r\n\r\neverybody  speaks Cantonese. The population  speak\r\n\r\nCantonese,  the  police speak Cantonese  from  the\r\n\r\nlowest  to  the  top  whereas  in  Singapore   the\r\n\r\ncomposition  of the population is such  that  some\r\n\r\nspeak  Cantonese,  others  speak  Hokkien,  others\r\n\r\nspeak   Teochew,  some  speak  Tamil,  some  speak\r\n\r\nMalayalam, some speak Mandarin, some speak  Malay,\r\n\r\nand  so on. And it would be highly dangerous in  a\r\n\r\nsociety which uses several languages to let in  as\r\n\r\nevidence this statement where the police inspector\r\n\r\nhimself  would  not be the person  who  hears  the\r\n\r\nstatement  direct and comprehends it  direct  from\r\n\r\nthe  person  making the statement; but the  police\r\n\r\ninspector  would have to comprehend it through  an\r\n\r\ninterpreter  who,  the section says,  could  be  a\r\n\r\nperson interested in the arrest of that person.  A\r\n\r\nvery dangerous situation indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully aware, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the\r\n\r\npolice have for a number of years - this is not  the\r\n\r\nfirst    time   that   the   police   have    made\r\n\r\nrepresentations;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey have made representations for the last 20  to\r\n\r\n30  years - to bring about such an amendment because\r\n\r\nif  this  amendment is brought about  it  will  be\r\n\r\neasier for them to secure convictions. It is  well\r\n\r\nknown,  Mr  Speaker,  that when  the  prosecution\r\n\r\npresents a case in the court and when a confession\r\n\r\nis  sought to be put in evidence, in 99 cases  out\r\n\r\nof  100, you will find that the confession is  the\r\n\r\nonly  evidence that links the accused to the crime\r\n\r\nwith  which  he  is charged. It  could  not  be  a\r\n\r\ncoincidence that in 99 cases out of 100, in  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  confessions are produced, there is no other\r\n\r\nlink  of  evidence connecting the accused  to  the\r\n\r\ncrime. This amendment, Mr Speaker, will make  the\r\n\r\nposition  even worse than what it  now  is.  In  a\r\n\r\nconfession the person confessing has to  be  taken\r\n\r\nbefore  a  magistrate who, after certain questions\r\n\r\nput to the accused and satisfying himself that the\r\n\r\nstatement  is  not only voluntary but volunteered,\r\n\r\nthen  records  a statement from the  accused.  But\r\n\r\nhere  the  statement would be made by  an  accused\r\n\r\nperson to an inspector, either to him directly  or\r\n\r\nin  his hearing. It takes it even further. It need\r\n\r\nnot  be  made to the inspector. All that  need  be\r\n\r\ndone  is  that  it should be made in his  hearing;\r\n\r\nthen  a  person  interested in  the  arrest  could\r\n\r\ntranslate   it   to   the  inspector.   In   these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, it would appear that the  statement\r\n\r\nwould  be  admissible in evidence.  Members  might\r\n\r\nsay,  \"If  he is guilty, why should his  statement\r\n\r\nnot  be  put  in?\" Certainly, if he is guilty,  he\r\n\r\nshould  be  convicted.  But the  great  difficulty\r\n\r\nabout  these matters, Mr Speaker, Sir, as we  all\r\n\r\nknow,  is to sift the truth from the untruth,  and\r\n\r\nin  a  system of criminal justice, not  only  must\r\n\r\njustice  be done but it must be seen to  be  done.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, if this Bill is carried through,\r\n\r\nthe  inference might well be that justice  is  not\r\n\r\nseemingly being done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not\r\n\r\nhere  early enough to know whether the Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park prefaced his remarks by saying that he\r\n\r\nhad the concurrence of the majority of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Bar  in expressing the views that he  did.

Where\r\n\r\naccording to the law justice is being flouted  and\r\n\r\nnot  being  done, then it is the business  of  the\r\n\r\nlegislature to see that the law is changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was early enough to listen to the objections of\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member to two different points. He is  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of retaining jury trials for all  criminal\r\n\r\nmatters. But he is against the change in admitting\r\n\r\nevidence  made by an accused person  to  a  police\r\n\r\nofficer after arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first case, he asked, \"Why change a system\r\n\r\nwhich  nobody has found anything wrong with?\"  Let\r\n\r\nme  state quite simply that it is common knowledge\r\n\r\nat  the  Bar  that  the  law  as  it  is - not  only\r\n\r\nunfortunately in jury cases but also in other than\r\n\r\njury  cases - becomes a game at which the skill  and\r\n\r\nthe  agility of the lawyer, plus the obstacles put\r\n\r\nby  the legislature on the prosecution, should, if\r\n\r\nthe lawyer is sufficiently skilful, and his client\r\n\r\nis  sufficiently intelligent, enable the lawyer to\r\n\r\nget  his  client off. That is not the business  of\r\n\r\nthe administration of law. It is to do justice and\r\n\r\nto see that right is upheld and wrong is punished.\r\n\r\nLet  me  tell  the hon. Member that there  is  one\r\n\r\nbasic  defect in jury trials in Malaya which makes\r\n\r\nit  fundamentally quite different from  what  jury\r\n\r\ntrials  are supposed to be. In England from whence\r\n\r\nthis  concept first arose, the theory is  that  if\r\n\r\nyou  are  accused by the State of having committed\r\n\r\nan act which entitles the State to punish you, you\r\n\r\nshould be found guilty by your peers. If you are a\r\n\r\nnoble lord, then your peers are the members of the\r\n\r\nHouse  of  Lords. If you are an ordinary commoner,\r\n\r\nthen  you  will have 12 common jurymen sitting  to\r\n\r\nhear the evidence and decide for or against your\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninnocence.

If you are tried by a special  jury,\r\n\r\nyou   are  tried  by  an  English-educated  elite.\r\n\r\nAnd - the Member for Farrer Park knows this as  well\r\n\r\nas  I do - every time the box containing the list of\r\n\r\njurors  is taken out, the first question  you  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar is, \"Is this a special  jury  or  a\r\n\r\ncommon  jury?\" Everybody knows that if you  get  a\r\n\r\nspecial  jury, the chances of getting a conviction\r\n\r\nincreases. Let us be reasonably honest  about  all\r\n\r\nthis. A jury trial is a foreign implantation which\r\n\r\nworks reasonably well, but it requires a very high\r\n\r\ndegree  of skill both from the Bar and the  Bench.\r\n\r\nIt requires also a state of affairs which can only\r\n\r\nexist  in an ordered and settled state of  society\r\n\r\nwhere everybody is prepared to come up and say, \"I\r\n\r\nsaw A stab B,\" and he feels that it is his duty to\r\n\r\ntell the world that he witnessed the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is justice being thwarted? I say `Yes', on pure\r\n\r\ntechnicalities. Every member of the Bar knew  that\r\n\r\na  certain  person in the famous Green Bus  murder\r\n\r\ncase  took a tin of petrol, threw it into an  air-conditioned room, lit it, the whole room  went  on\r\n\r\nfire  and  five  persons died. The  case  went  on\r\n\r\ntrial. The jury had not the slightest doubt as  to\r\n\r\nthe  guilt of the accused and, they convicted  him\r\n\r\nunanimously. Unfortunately, in the course  of  his\r\n\r\nsumming - up    to    the   jury - these    are    all\r\n\r\ntechnicalities of the law - the Judge did not put to\r\n\r\nthe jury the possibility that there was the chance\r\n\r\nthat the accused person might have done it in self-defence. Therefore, there was an acquittal and the\r\n\r\nGovernment ordered a new trial on other charges - as\r\n\r\nthere  were  five  murders, therefore  four  other\r\n\r\nmurders  had  still to be tried. When the  accused\r\n\r\nwent before a second Judge, the Judge said, \"Is it\r\n\r\nnot  a  pity that a man should be persecuted twice\r\n\r\nin   this  way?\"  And  the  Attorney-General,  for\r\n\r\nreasons  which must have weighed very  heavily  on\r\n\r\nhis  mind,  but  which I am unable  to  see  could\r\n\r\npossibly have existed, withdrew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   prosecution,  and  a  man  who  undoubtedly,\r\n\r\naccording  to seven jurymen, committed murder  was\r\n\r\nlet  off  free. I say that if we continue  to  pay\r\n\r\nattention  and  respect to forms and  not  to  the\r\n\r\nsubstance  of  the  rule of  law,  then  we  shall\r\n\r\ncollapse,  because the law will be held  in  utter\r\n\r\ncontempt.  A  law  that is unable  to  punish  the\r\n\r\nguilty, because it has got itself involved in  the\r\n\r\nintricacies  which  our  experts  have   not   yet\r\n\r\nmastered,  is  a law which is unsuitable.  Nobody,\r\n\r\ncertainly  not the two practising Members  on  the\r\n\r\nother  side of this House, would suggest that  our\r\n\r\nJudges cannot make up their minds on facts as well\r\n\r\nas  the jurymen can. I do not think they will make\r\n\r\nthat  allegation. If they are wise, I do not think\r\n\r\nthey will even mention it. I suggest let us get on\r\n\r\nwith the business of seeing that justice is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I have to defend the preservation of jury\r\n\r\ntrials for murder - we are not dispensing with it in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of murder. It is because the Federation\r\n\r\nhad  decided  to move in that direction  and  have\r\n\r\njury  trials  for  murder. This is  one  of  those\r\n\r\nthings  that  have  happened.  We  have  to   move\r\n\r\ncloser - so we line up with their law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having elected to defend this, an English\r\n\r\nimportation - the  Member  says,  \"Keep  it,  it  is\r\n\r\ngood.\"  He then says, \"Let us not have an  English\r\n\r\npractice,\"  namely, a policeman  giving  evidence.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the  practice  in  England,   every\r\n\r\npoliceman  can give evidence on what  the  accused\r\n\r\nperson  has  said. But the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\ndoes  not  want  that, because that  will  help  a\r\n\r\nconviction.  So  he is not interested  in  English\r\n\r\npractice;   he   assiduously  avoids   the   whole\r\n\r\nargument. He talked about Indian practice, and how\r\n\r\nwise   the   Indians  were  in  preventing   their\r\n\r\npolicemen  from  giving evidence, but  how  unwise\r\n\r\nthey were in getting rid of the juries. Let us not\r\n\r\nhave  it  both  ways. Every person knows  when  an\r\n\r\naccused person's defences are down and that is  at\r\n\r\nthe  time when he is caught in the act. Before  he\r\n\r\nhas  had  time  to think out a clever defence - that\r\n\r\nhis grandmother was ill on the blank day of blank,\r\n\r\nbut the policeman thought he saw him there, and he\r\n\r\nproduced the grandmother,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrand-uncle, and two great grandchildren who  said\r\n\r\nthat  he was at such and such an unnumbered  attap\r\n\r\nhut  in an unknown village. We could have gone the\r\n\r\nwhole  hog  and said, \"Let us accept the  practice\r\n\r\nfor the whole of the police force.\" But because we\r\n\r\nappreciate  the  difficulties in  a  multi-lingual\r\n\r\nsociety and the fact that, in some cases,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park has alleged, in  the  past\r\n\r\nthere  was this practice of employing a  thief  to\r\n\r\ncatch  a  thief, we have therefore restricted  the\r\n\r\nscope  of  the new provisions to police inspectors\r\n\r\nand  above.  Nobody, let alone the two  honourable\r\n\r\nand  learned Members of the Bar on the other side,\r\n\r\nwould  suggest that the English-educated, who  are\r\n\r\ngood  enough to be inspectors, would go into Court\r\n\r\nand   perjure.  This  is  a  step  in  the   right\r\n\r\ndirection.  If  we  are able quickly  to  set  the\r\n\r\npolice  force  right and get out the  thieves  who\r\n\r\nwere  employed to catch the thieves, we  shall  be\r\n\r\nhappy to come back to this House, after these  new\r\n\r\nprovisions   have  been  successfully   put   into\r\n\r\noperation, to report that we have a better  police\r\n\r\nforce, that no more thieves are employed to  catch\r\n\r\nthieves,  and  we  will ask for the  extension  of\r\n\r\nthese provisions to the whole of the police force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after listening to\r\n\r\nthe forensic ability displayed by my colleague and\r\n\r\nleader  here, I think there is very little for  me\r\n\r\nto  say  in reply. I would, however, like to  make\r\n\r\nthis  point: that the Member for Farrer Park seems\r\n\r\nto  be  confused as to what this Bill really  sets\r\n\r\nout  to  do. He has accepted the position that  it\r\n\r\nwould be reasonable and necessary to increase  the\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the Lower Courts. That  being  so,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  I  suggest that less  and  less  of\r\n\r\ncriminal cases, other than capital cases, will  be\r\n\r\nfinding their way into the High Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  such  has  expressed  any  adverse\r\n\r\ndislike  of the jury system as is practised  here.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not the intention that the jury system  be\r\n\r\nabolished in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  territory. The Government is  proceeding  to\r\n\r\nfollow,  not  what is the practice in India  where\r\n\r\nthere  has  been a recommendation  that  the  jury\r\n\r\nsystem  be  abolished, but rather the practice  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya where the jury system  is\r\n\r\nretained for capital cases only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have written into this law certain safeguards.\r\n\r\nIf  it is found desirable to extend trial by  jury\r\n\r\nto other than capital cases, there is provision in\r\n\r\nour law for this to be done. On the recommendation\r\n\r\nof  the Chief Justice, and with the consent of the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  can  so\r\n\r\nagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of caution statements, I must\r\n\r\nsay,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that this Government  also\r\n\r\nhas  been  able to resist pressure from the  local\r\n\r\npolice   who  have  sought  to  make  all  caution\r\n\r\nstatements   made  to  police   officers   to   be\r\n\r\nadmissible in evidence. However, we are trying  to\r\n\r\ngive  the  new  system a fair trial.  We  are  not\r\n\r\nproposing  that  caution statements  made  to  all\r\n\r\npolice  officers  should  be  admissible.  We  are\r\n\r\nrestricting  these  caution  statements  only   to\r\n\r\nofficers   of  and  above  the  rank   of   police\r\n\r\ninspector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will see how the new system works. If it\r\n\r\nworks  well, I have no doubt that it will be  able\r\n\r\nto  develop,  as do other systems.  If  precedents\r\n\r\nelsewhere  are a good guide, I have no doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe  police  here will be able to discharge  their\r\n\r\nduties  in as satisfactory a manner as the  police\r\n\r\nin   England,  Hongkong,  and  Sarawak.  So,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I do not think that there is  cause\r\n\r\nfor   us   to  be  in  any  way  alarmed  at   the\r\n\r\nimprovements  that the Government  is  seeking  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  into  our system of  administering  the\r\n\r\ncriminal law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of\r\n\r\nMr Speaker as Chairman and such Members as may be\r\n\r\nnominated by the Committee of Selection. -[Mr  A.\r\n\r\nP.

The Registration  of\r\n\r\nCriminals  Ordinance  requires  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nCriminals  to maintain a register of, inter  alia,\r\n\r\npersons convicted of any offences committed within\r\n\r\nany scheduled territory and persons ordered to  be\r\n\r\nbanished,  expelled or deported from Singapore  or\r\n\r\nfrom  any Colony, protectorate or protected  state\r\n\r\nfor  the time being included in the Third Schedule\r\n\r\nof the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two places at present included in the Third\r\n\r\nSchedule  of  the Ordinance are the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  the  State of Brunei. Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya and  the  State  of  Brunei\r\n\r\ntogether  form  the  principal  registration  area\r\n\r\nunder this Ordinance. Both this Government and the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Federation of Malaya have agreed\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore and the Federation of Malaya  only\r\n\r\nwill  form  the principal registration area  under\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is thought desirable to\r\n\r\nremove Brunei from the principal registration area\r\n\r\nand  to  treat that territory in the same  way  as\r\n\r\nNorth Borneo and Sarawak, that is, as part of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  possessions, protectorates and  protected\r\n\r\nstates outside the principal registration area, in\r\n\r\nrespect  of which the same registrable particulars\r\n\r\nof  criminals may be recorded with the approval of\r\n\r\nthe  Yang di-Pertuan Negara under section 5 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill gives effect to these\r\n\r\nintentions   by   deleting   the   definition   of\r\n\r\n\"scheduled   territories\",   and   amending    the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"principal registration  area\"  to\r\n\r\ninclude  only  Singapore  and  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken in clause 2\r\n\r\nto   make   a  consequential  amendment   to   the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of \"registrable particulars\",  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  inclusion  in  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill, which was before  the  Assembly\r\n\r\ntoday,   of  a  provision  to  take  into  account\r\n\r\noutstanding  offences  in  sentencing  an  accused\r\n\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of the Federation of Malaya has\r\n\r\nalso agreed to the continuation of the system of a\r\n\r\nsingle  Criminal Records Office located  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.

In  fact, I believe  that  public\r\n\r\nopinion  demands  that more  drastic  measures  be\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the  Government to maintain  peace  and\r\n\r\norder  in the face of the prevalent abnormal crime\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the new Government came into power, we have\r\n\r\ntaken several measures against gangster haunts and\r\n\r\ntheir sources of income. We have closed down  pin-tables and juke-box premises which were the haunts\r\n\r\nof   gangsters   and  thugs.  We  have   dissolved\r\n\r\nsocieties which are purely gambling dens under the\r\n\r\nprotection of secret society members. We have  not\r\n\r\nhesitated to go for the really big shots as recent\r\n\r\nevents have shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special police squads have struck fear into\r\n\r\nthe  hearts of these gangsters, a number  of  whom\r\n\r\nhad  met  with  death. We will  go  on  waging  an\r\n\r\nunrelenting  campaign against them.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nplace for relaxation of efforts and vigilance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional powers asked for in this Bill are\r\n\r\npart  of this campaign. Sir, before I come to  the\r\n\r\ndetails of this Bill, I would like to stress  that\r\n\r\nit  is  because  of  the  present  state  of  gang\r\n\r\nlawlessness  that the Government is seeking  these\r\n\r\nadditional and exceptional powers contained in the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government, like any democratic Government,\r\n\r\ndoes not wish to lightly deprive the individual of\r\n\r\nhis liberty by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexecutive action, nor for that matter for a longer\r\n\r\ntime than is absolutely necessary. But when we are\r\n\r\ndealing  with  unruly and unprincipled  thugs  and\r\n\r\ngangsters  and because of the terrorism they  have\r\n\r\nspread,  the ordinary process of law is inadequate\r\n\r\nto  deal with the crimes and misdeeds committed by\r\n\r\nthem.  Special powers such as those  contained  in\r\n\r\nthis Bill are therefore necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In adopting these measures the Government is\r\n\r\nconscious that they provide but temporary remedies\r\n\r\nand  that  in dealing with these secret societies,\r\n\r\naccount has to be taken of the social and economic\r\n\r\ncauses  which  have contributed to the  growth  of\r\n\r\ngangsterism     and     lawlessness.     Increased\r\n\r\nunemployment,    slum    conditions,    lack    of\r\n\r\npurposefulness  in directing the energies  of  the\r\n\r\nyoung,  lack of recreational facilities,  constant\r\n\r\nexposure to yellow culture, undesirable literature \r\n\r\nand - films  all these have caused secret societies\r\n\r\nto flourish and have lured youth to their ranks by\r\n\r\nthe glitter of sensationalism and easy money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House is aware, the Government has\r\n\r\ntaken  a strong line in the banning of undesirable\r\n\r\npublications  and in tightening the censorship  of\r\n\r\nfilms.  Some of the causes can only be tackled  by\r\n\r\nlong-term  measures and their solution  cannot  be\r\n\r\nachieved  quickly. But the Government has  already\r\n\r\ntaken  action  on  these permanent  remedies.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  provision of better  housing,  more\r\n\r\nopen   spaces,   more   recreational   facilities,\r\n\r\ncommunity   centres,   schools,   etc, and   the\r\n\r\nencouragement  of industries, the full  impact  of\r\n\r\nwhich can only be felt in the years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to the details of the Bill, the main\r\n\r\nprovisions  are  (1) to extend  the  life  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal   Law  (Temporary  Provisions)  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich  expires  in October this year  for  another\r\n\r\nfive  years;  (2) to give the Minister alternative\r\n\r\npowers  either  to  impose  detention  orders   on\r\n\r\npersons  associated with activities of a  criminal\r\n\r\nnature  or  to  order that they  be  placed  under\r\n\r\npolice  supervision; (3) to extend the  period  of\r\n\r\ndetention made by the Minister from six months  as\r\n\r\nat  present  to  one year; (4) to  impose  special\r\n\r\nrestrictions on those persons placed under  police\r\n\r\nsupervision and special\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npenalties on them for breaking the restrictions or\r\n\r\nfor being convicted of specified offences; and (5)\r\n\r\nto  issue special identity cards to those  subject\r\n\r\nto police supervision under this Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of the principal Ordinance will lapse on\r\n\r\n20th  October,  1959, and clause  2  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nextends  its life for another five years. In  view\r\n\r\nof  the  intention that the maximum initial period\r\n\r\nof supervision should be three years with the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara being empowered to extend  this\r\n\r\nperiod  if  he thinks fit - it is only logical  that\r\n\r\nthe  life of the Ordinance should be extended  for\r\n\r\nat  least five years instead of extending  it  for\r\n\r\nanother year and then introducing further amending\r\n\r\nBills to extend its life from year to year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential threat of violence is still with us\r\n\r\nand we still have need for the continuance of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Furthermore, the  knowledge  that  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance will be in force for another five  years\r\n\r\nwill  be a deterrent to both present and potential\r\n\r\ngangsters  and,  I  hope,  will  also  make   them\r\n\r\nseriously  consider  the advantages  of  reforming\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 is a clause which empowers the Minister\r\n\r\neither   to   order  the  detention   of   persons\r\n\r\nassociated with activities of a criminal nature in\r\n\r\nthe  interests of public safety, peace,  and  good\r\n\r\norder  for a period up to one year or to  make  an\r\n\r\norder  directing that they be placed under  police\r\n\r\nsupervision  for  a  period  not  exceeding  three\r\n\r\nyears.  The  extension of the period of  detention\r\n\r\norder by the Minister from six months to one  year\r\n\r\nis  aimed  at the real hard-core criminal  leaders\r\n\r\nand fighters who must be removed out of commission\r\n\r\nfor  an  effective period of time.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, there are many gangsters including some  who\r\n\r\nare  already detained, who are really  misled  and\r\n\r\nmisguided  persons, often teenagers, who  are  not\r\n\r\nall  lost to the society of decent people and  who\r\n\r\nshould   be  given  a  second  chance  to   redeem\r\n\r\nthemselves   and  go  straight.  This   class   of\r\n\r\ngangsters  could  be put under police  supervision\r\n\r\ninstead  of being detained. They would be released\r\n\r\nand  returned  to  the intimate  circle  of  their\r\n\r\nrelatives and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfriends. They would be subject to restrictions but\r\n\r\nthey  could  lead comparatively normal  lives  and\r\n\r\nparticipate in remunerative employment. They  will\r\n\r\nnot  be bothered so long as they do not break  the\r\n\r\nrestrictions  imposed on them  or  commit  certain\r\n\r\nspecified crimes of violence for which the penalty\r\n\r\nis deterrent prison sentences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 replaces the existing procedure of\r\n\r\npersons  under detention orders being released  on\r\n\r\nsuspension orders and provides for the Minister to\r\n\r\nmake  orders for police supervision in respect  of\r\n\r\npersons  who are already detained under  detention\r\n\r\norders, or under detention orders the validity  of\r\n\r\nwhich  has expired. I can give the assurance  that\r\n\r\nthe  orders under these two clauses will  be  made\r\n\r\nwith  the  greatest care and examination.  I  must\r\n\r\nalso  point out that the powers conferred  on  the\r\n\r\nMinister by clauses 7 and 9 would still, as in the\r\n\r\nprincipal Ordinance, be subject to the consent  of\r\n\r\nthe  Public Prosecutor being obtained and  subject\r\n\r\nto  confirmation  by  the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\nafter  consideration of reports from the  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  appointed  under  section  51  of   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  The Minister therefore  does  not  act\r\n\r\ncompletely  on his own. There are these  important\r\n\r\nsafeguards which I have just mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 makes persons directed to be under\r\n\r\npolice  supervision subject to other  disabilities\r\n\r\nand  provisions  intended to  make  it  easier  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  their  activities and to  prevent  or  to\r\n\r\ndeter  them from committing crimes. If they  break\r\n\r\nthe  restrictions  imposed  on  them  under  these\r\n\r\npolice supervision orders or if they consort  with\r\n\r\nother   persons  subject  to  similar  supervision\r\n\r\norders  without permission, or if they  are  found\r\n\r\nloitering in public places or are found at  places\r\n\r\nwhere  breaches of the peace have been  committed,\r\n\r\nor are found in the company of two or more persons\r\n\r\nsubject  to  supervision  without  being  able  to\r\n\r\naccount  for themselves satisfactorily,  they  are\r\n\r\nliable   on   conviction  to  be   punished   with\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthree  years and not less than one year. Also,  if\r\n\r\nsuch  persons are convicted of any of the offences\r\n\r\nincluded  in the Third Schedule to the  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nthey will become liable to double the maximum term\r\n\r\nof  imprisonment imposed therefor and will also be\r\n\r\nliable  to  caning.  Sir,  we  are  not  alone  in\r\n\r\nimposing  these special restrictions on  specified\r\n\r\noffences for they are taken from the Prevention of\r\n\r\nCrimes   Ordinance   recently   enacted   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. This clause also  provides\r\n\r\nfor   the   taking  of  photographs   and   finger\r\n\r\nimpressions of such persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 makes corresponding provision for the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara to extend the validity  of\r\n\r\ndetention  orders  for periods not  exceeding  one\r\n\r\nyear  at  any  one  time to be in  line  with  the\r\n\r\ninitial  period  of  up  to  one  year  for  these\r\n\r\ndetention orders. The existing provision  that  no\r\n\r\ndetention  order  shall extend  beyond  two  years\r\n\r\nstill  remains. The clause also empowers the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan   Negara  to  extend  the   period   of\r\n\r\nsupervision orders from time to time.  As  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  detention  orders  under  the  principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance, he may also refer any supervision order\r\n\r\nfor   further   consideration   by   an   Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 gives the Minister powers to make rules\r\n\r\nproviding,  inter alia, for the issue  of  special\r\n\r\nidentity   cards   to  all  persons   subject   to\r\n\r\nsupervision orders. This is desirable for purposes\r\n\r\nof  their easier identification by the police  and\r\n\r\nthe control of their movements and activities.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  the intention, however, to issue identity\r\n\r\ncards of a conspicuous nature like having a big  X\r\n\r\nendorsed  on  them, or having a  different  colour\r\n\r\nfrom  the ordinary cards. They will be made easily\r\n\r\nidentifiable by the police without making them too\r\n\r\nobvious. This is desirable because it is felt that\r\n\r\npersons  subject to police supervision under  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  should  not  be hampered  by  a  public\r\n\r\nbranding   from   obtaining  and   succeeding   in\r\n\r\nlegitimate employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other clauses which should perhaps be\r\n\r\nmentioned  are  clause  6  which  now  gives   the\r\n\r\nMinister the power to amend, add to or vary any of\r\n\r\nthe Schedules in the Ordinance, and clause 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich   now   empowers  the   Minister   to   make\r\n\r\nappointments to the Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken of\r\n\r\nincorporating  in  the Bill  a  number  of  formal\r\n\r\namendments, for example, the substitution  of  the\r\n\r\nwords  \"Governor  in Council\" by \"Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara\", and \"Chief Secretary\" by \"Minister\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few amendments either for clarification or of a\r\n\r\npurely drafting nature are also incorporated,  for\r\n\r\nexample, the renumbering of Schedules due  to  the\r\n\r\nfact that the First to the Fifth Schedules in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  have been repealed by Ordinance  34  of\r\n\r\n1959 dated 26th March, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these then are the aims and objects of this\r\n\r\nBill. The additional powers and measures asked for\r\n\r\nare  drastic but, as i stressed earlier on, we are\r\n\r\ndealing  with  unruly and unprincipled  thugs  and\r\n\r\ngangsters who have no regard for the rule of  law.\r\n\r\nThe  present Government is determined to  end  the\r\n\r\npresent  state of gang lawlessness and I am  sure,\r\n\r\nwith  this  end  in  view, the Bill  will  commend\r\n\r\nitself  to the House and to the law-abiding public\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to congratulate the Government on this  Bill\r\n\r\nto amend the principal Ordinance. But there is one\r\n\r\naspect of this Bill which I would like to bring to\r\n\r\nthe attention of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has been enacted in order that the\r\n\r\npublic  safety, peace and good order in  Singapore\r\n\r\nmight  be  preserved, and there is no  doubt  that\r\n\r\nthere are elements in the country doing their best\r\n\r\nto  upset public safety, peace and good order.  In\r\n\r\nthis  connection, too, Sir, and in respect of  the\r\n\r\npoint  I  wish  to make, I wish to  bring  to  the\r\n\r\nattention of the House the Preservation of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity  Ordinance  which is  also  an  Ordinance\r\n\r\ndesigned  to secure public safety, possibly  at  a\r\n\r\ndifferent level, but nevertheless to secure public\r\n\r\nsafety. In the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreservation  of  Public Security  Ordinance,  Mr\r\n\r\n(Deputy)  Speaker,  there  is  provision  for   an\r\n\r\nappeals  tribunal  to which  any  person,  who  is\r\n\r\ndetained  under the provisions of that  Ordinance,\r\n\r\ncould  appeal. Now, the appeals tribunal comprises\r\n\r\na High Court Judge and two District Judges, and to\r\n\r\nthis  appeals  tribunal any person  who  has  been\r\n\r\ndetained  under the provisions of the Preservation\r\n\r\nof  Public  Security Ordinance  could  put  in  an\r\n\r\nappeal.  The  appeal is heard in camera,  but  the\r\n\r\nappeal  is  heard,  and the  detained  person  has\r\n\r\nopportunities  of making his defence  before  that\r\n\r\ntribunal. In other words, Mr (Deputy) Speaker, he\r\n\r\nhimself  might be able to say something or  adduce\r\n\r\nsome  evidence which has not reached the  ears  or\r\n\r\nthe  eyes of the Minister in charge. There  is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that when the safety of the State is  being\r\n\r\nthreatened, the executive must be given sufficient\r\n\r\npowers  to  combat that evil. But the greater  the\r\n\r\npowers  that  are given to combat that  evil,  Mr\r\n\r\n(Deputy) Speaker, I venture to suggest that  there\r\n\r\nmust be corresponding provisions which will enable\r\n\r\npersons   who  possibly  should  not   have   been\r\n\r\naccused - maybe one in a hundred; but even  in  that\r\n\r\nexceptional case that person should be  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity of presenting his case with a view  to\r\n\r\ndetermining whether or not his detention has  been\r\n\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Preservation of Public Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance  makes  provision  for  that.  In   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance, Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, there is  an\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Committee  which has  the  powers  of  a\r\n\r\nCourt;  it  can subpoena and administer oaths  and\r\n\r\ntake  evidence. But there is no provision in  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  which gives the right to a  person  who\r\n\r\nhas  been  detained to prefer an  appeal  to  this\r\n\r\nAdvisory Committee. The Ordinance merely says that\r\n\r\nhis   case   may  be  submitted  to  the  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee.  It  is not obligatory but  permissive;\r\n\r\nthe  Minister or some other person in  charge  may\r\n\r\nsubmit his case to the Advisory Committee. As  far\r\n\r\nas  I  have  been able to ascertain, Mr  (Deputy)\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  position  now  is  that  this\r\n\r\nAdvisory Committee is only given papers which  the\r\n\r\nMinister himself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas seen. Now, where the Minister himself has seen\r\n\r\nthe papers and satisfied himself on the advice  of\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Prosecutor, it stands to reason  that\r\n\r\nthe  Advisory  Committee  itself  must  also   be\r\n\r\nsatisfied.  After these safeguards, it  is  hardly\r\n\r\nlikely  that the Advisory Committee could come  to\r\n\r\nany   other  conclusion.  But  what  I  would   be\r\n\r\ninterested to see, Mr (Deputy) Speaker,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nfor the person detained to be enabled to bring  as\r\n\r\nof right to this Advisory Committee evidence which\r\n\r\nhas  not  been placed before the Minister himself.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, I think some provision should\r\n\r\nbe  made  in  the  Bill  which  will  enable  this\r\n\r\ndetained person to make his appeal in the same way\r\n\r\nthat the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance\r\n\r\nenables  persons detained under its provisions  to\r\n\r\nmake the appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for that observation, Sir, I am entirely in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, I heartily support this\r\n\r\nCriminal Law (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment No.\r\n\r\n2)  Bill.  This amending Bill is to eradicate  the\r\n\r\nmisdeeds   of   the  previous  Government,   whose\r\n\r\nattitude was based on partial changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, in the light of the\r\n\r\nwritten language contained in this Bill, it  seems\r\n\r\nthat  this  Bill is drastic and harsh. But  if  we\r\n\r\nexamine it and take into consideration the  threat\r\n\r\nto   a   person's  safety  under   the   wave   of\r\n\r\ngangsterism,  then  this  amending  Bill  is   not\r\n\r\ndrastic  and harsh enough. The new Government  has\r\n\r\nits  responsibility to the people, and it  has  to\r\n\r\nbear  in mind the interests of the masses  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  In  order  to  ensure  security  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry, we have to enact proper laws, and  if  we\r\n\r\ncannot  do  so,  then we will  be  just  like  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government. Because of this,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthis  amending  Bill  is  decisive.  We  must   be\r\n\r\ndecisive  and provide in this Bill means to  check\r\n\r\nthe activities of gangsterism. The amending\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill is a good prescription. It is `tasty' to  us,\r\n\r\nand to those who are aware of the implications  of\r\n\r\nthis amendment, they will know that it is to their\r\n\r\nown interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must know what is gangsterism. We must know\r\n\r\ntheir  origin.  Since  the 18th  century,  Chinese\r\n\r\nimmigrants  have  poured into  this  country  from\r\n\r\nevery   corner  of  China.  From  the  inflow   of\r\n\r\nimmigrants  into Malaya and Singapore, there  came\r\n\r\nthe   Ang   Bin  Hoay.  This  Ang  Bin  Hoay   was\r\n\r\nestablished in Singapore, and its purpose  was  to\r\n\r\noverthrow  the Manchurian Government and reinstate\r\n\r\nthe  Ming Dynasty in China. But because of changes\r\n\r\nin the society, this Ang Bin Hoay dissolved itself\r\n\r\ninto many small gangster groups. We must not under-rate  the activities of this organisation. It  has\r\n\r\nits  own traditions and its own merits. If we  can\r\n\r\nwitness a ceremony of these gangsters and can look\r\n\r\ninto some of the regulations of this organisation,\r\n\r\nwe  can then easily find that they strongly uphold\r\n\r\ntheir  unity  and  justice. From  these  came  the\r\n\r\ntheory  of  gangsterism. It is based on what  they\r\n\r\ncall  justice to unite the gangster members. Their\r\n\r\nprinciple  has  been handed down  since  the  18th\r\n\r\ncentury  to  the  present society.  Although  this\r\n\r\norganisation looks very simple, their influence is\r\n\r\nwidespread.  At  the same time,  because  of  this\r\n\r\ninfluence,  the  leadership in the  ranks  of  the\r\n\r\ngangsters is able to continue up to the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that this Government has taken office, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  masses  of the  people  realise  its\r\n\r\nattitude  towards  the gangsters.  My  Party,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., stands for the principle of socialism, and\r\n\r\nthis  gangsterism is detrimental to socialism.  We\r\n\r\nmust know why these gangsters become gangsters.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that a gangster becomes one because he was\r\n\r\nnot  properly brought up when young and living  in\r\n\r\nobscurity. The old social institutions contributed\r\n\r\nmuch  to the organisation of gangsterism. We  want\r\n\r\nto  suppress  gangsterism. We  must  think  of  an\r\n\r\nalternative  to  help to reform gangsters  and  to\r\n\r\nlead them to the road of happiness. Today we amend\r\n\r\nthis    Criminal   Law   (Temporary    Provisions)\r\n\r\n(Amendment  No. 2) Bill in order to  suppress  the\r\n\r\nobstinate elements of gangsterism. We must make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem realise their present situation, for they are\r\n\r\nresponsible for the disorderliness in the  present\r\n\r\nsociety. On the one hand, they can kill a  dog  to\r\n\r\ngive  a lesson to the monkey. This can be said  to\r\n\r\nbe  a lesson to the new members of the gangs.  The\r\n\r\nprevious   Government  were  different  from   the\r\n\r\npresent   Government  in  their  attitude  towards\r\n\r\ngangsterism.  The  previous Government  adopted  a\r\n\r\npartial  policy towards gangsterism. When  certain\r\n\r\nthings happened they put all these gangsters  into\r\n\r\ngaol.  They just put them in there for  a  certain\r\n\r\nperiod  without educating them and without  giving\r\n\r\nthem  any  opportunity to reform themselves.  This\r\n\r\nwas  the policy of the previous Government towards\r\n\r\ngangsterism.   Therefore   I   support   the   new\r\n\r\nGovernment  unconditionaly to amend  the  criminal\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, we give them an opportunity to\r\n\r\nget  their places in life again and, on the  other\r\n\r\nhand,   we   make  them  realise  that  they   are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the state of insecurity  of  our\r\n\r\npresent society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

But if\r\n\r\nwe  are to be realistic, and if we are to be  able\r\n\r\nto  deal  with the situation, it is very necessary\r\n\r\nthat we get these extraordinary powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also, Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, seen to\r\n\r\nit that there are provisions written into this law\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the powers that we seek are not in\r\n\r\nany  way  abused.  As  my  colleague  has  already\r\n\r\npointed  out, these powers cannot be exercised  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister unless he first gets the consent  of\r\n\r\nthe Public Prosecutor, and when the detention  is\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Minister or police  supervision  is\r\n\r\nimposed  by  the  Minister  in  pursuance  of  the\r\n\r\nexercise  of these powers, the detainee still  has\r\n\r\nfurther safeguards, Sir.

The Indian\r\n\r\nAct and the whole law is extremely complicated. It\r\n\r\nlists  over  100  different kinds of  actions  and\r\n\r\nprovides  varying  periods of limitation,  varying\r\n\r\nfrom  one  year  up  to  60  years.  Many  of  the\r\n\r\nvariations are extremely arbitrary and the  Indian\r\n\r\ncourts have varied in their interpretation of  the\r\n\r\nAct.  The complication of the laws has given  rise\r\n\r\nto   the  need  for  bulky  commentaries.  In   an\r\n\r\nintroduction  to  one of these  commentaries,  Mr\r\n\r\nJustice Walsh said: \"Was it necessary in order  to\r\n\r\nprevent  a  man from sleeping over his  rights  to\r\n\r\ndevise 183 methods of defeating him, or is  it  to\r\n\r\nbe   that   in  order  to  appreciate  the   right\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  these 183  methods,  a  lawyer\r\n\r\nshould be forced to investigate no less than 8,000\r\n\r\nreported decisions?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Federation, a committee\r\n\r\nwas set up in 1950 to consider the law relating to\r\n\r\nlimitations.

As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the  Federation,  in  1953,  enacted  the\r\n\r\nLimitation Ordinance.

A loan by  an\r\n\r\nunlicensed  moneylender will be unenforceable.  To\r\n\r\nqualify  for  a  licence,  the  moneylender   must\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the  Registrar that  he  is  resident  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  is of good character,  is  a  fit  and\r\n\r\nproper  person to hold a licence, that he has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  disqualified from holding a licence and that\r\n\r\nhe has not, after the coming into operation of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, lent money to a person under  18  years\r\n\r\nof  age.  In  the case of a company or  firm,  the\r\n\r\nmanager must so satisfy the Registrar. The licence\r\n\r\nwould  show  the  moneylender's  true  name,   his\r\n\r\nbusiness  name  and the address  at  which  he  is\r\n\r\nauthorised  to  carry  on  business.  A  list   of\r\n\r\nlicensed  moneylenders will be  published  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Gazette. A moneylender who is refused a\r\n\r\nlicence may appeal to the Minister, whose decision\r\n\r\nshall  be final. A court is authorised to  suspend\r\n\r\nor  forfeit the licence of any person convicted by\r\n\r\nit  of  an  offence  under the  Ordinance  and  to\r\n\r\ndisqualify any such person from obtaining a  fresh\r\n\r\nlicence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lending money, moneylenders are required to\r\n\r\nhave  a written memorandum in the English language\r\n\r\nsigned by the borrower containing all the terms of\r\n\r\nthe contract, particularly the date, the principal\r\n\r\nand  the rate of interest. At the Committee  stage\r\n\r\nof  this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose to move\r\n\r\nan amendment to provide that the memorandum shall,\r\n\r\nwhere  there is more than one borrower, state  the\r\n\r\namount  paid  to  each of the  borrowers  and  the\r\n\r\namount  payable  by  each  of  the  borrowers   or\r\n\r\nsureties. A copy of the memorandum must  be  given\r\n\r\nto the borrower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the loan is for $100 or more, payment of\r\n\r\nthe loan is required to be made by crossed cheque,\r\n\r\ncrossed  postal order or crossed money order.

This Bill is laudable for the\r\n\r\nfact  that it protects the poor from the  clutches\r\n\r\nof  unscrupulous moneylenders. This  Bill,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion, should be implemented as soon as possible\r\n\r\nto  ease  the hardship of those already victimised\r\n\r\nand  to  prevent those who, because  of  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  may be victimised  in  the  future.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  do hope that Government will  give  a\r\n\r\nthought to the seemingly unavoidable loopholes  in\r\n\r\nthe  Moneylenders Bill which the moneylenders will\r\n\r\nfind,  as  the  Minister  himself  had  said.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  fight will not be only  against  the\r\n\r\nmoneylenders but also against those who  abet  the\r\n\r\nmoneylenders.  Strange as it may  seem,  the  very\r\n\r\npeople  whom this Bill is supposed to protect  are\r\n\r\nthe  worst  offenders.  To  mention  one  example,\r\n\r\nclause 16 (2) reads as follows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... no security given by the borrower or by\r\n\r\nany such agent as aforesaid in respect of any such\r\n\r\ncontract  shall if the amount of the loan  is  one\r\n\r\nhundred dollars or above be enforceable unless the\r\n\r\nmoney  lent was given to the borrower or his agent\r\n\r\nin  the form of a crossed cheque or crossed postal\r\n\r\norder  or crossed money order made payable to  the\r\n\r\nborrower or his agent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of this, nothing prevents the\r\n\r\nborrower  from  agreeing to  return  part  of  the\r\n\r\namount  that appears on the cheque even  when  the\r\n\r\nloan  is  in the form of a cheque. He may even  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  provide the difference  between  the\r\n\r\nactual  loan  and the amount that was signed  for,\r\n\r\nbefore the cheque for the full amount is handed to\r\n\r\nhim.  Moreover, clause 16 (2) - the one I have  just\r\n\r\nread - only  provides for loans  of  not  less  than\r\n\r\n$100.  It  is the very, very poor, Sir,  who  need\r\n\r\nprotection  most, who usually take loans  of  less\r\n\r\nthan $100, and I think that they are the ones  who\r\n\r\nshould be protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sunday Mail of 30th August reported:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Horse-racing, character lotteries, mahjong and\r\n\r\ncards  in  that order caused the downfall  of  the\r\n\r\nthousands now in the clutches of the moneylender.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  it must be admitted that people who get into\r\n\r\ndebt because of horse-racing, character lotteries,\r\n\r\nmahjong  and  cards are irresponsible people,  and\r\n\r\nwhen  irresponsible people are desperately in need\r\n\r\nof  money,  \"reckless\" is a mild term  to  use  to\r\n\r\ndescribe them. They therefore will be prepared  to\r\n\r\nbreak  all  rules and regulations  and  even  abet\r\n\r\nmoneylenders so long as they get the  money,  some\r\n\r\nin  spite  of the knowledge that it is detrimental\r\n\r\nto  themselves; and there are some who  will  sign\r\n\r\nany  form of contract, because they have  not  the\r\n\r\nslightest  intention of abiding by  the  contract.\r\n\r\nSir, this is a more difficult obstacle to overcome\r\n\r\nthan  the  difficulty  posed by  the  moneylenders\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that with the experts that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has in the Ministers and with the legal\r\n\r\nmind  of  a brilliant lawyer that is in our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  it should not be impossible to  find  a\r\n\r\nway  of overcoming this difficulty. The Government\r\n\r\nclaims  to  have  been  very successful  in  their\r\n\r\neducation  campaign  in  literacy,  language   and\r\n\r\npolitics.  Perhaps I may be permitted  to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat   Government   launches   another   education\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  educate irresponsible  and  reckless\r\n\r\npeople  who  do damage not only to themselves  and\r\n\r\ntheir families, but also to innocent and deserving\r\n\r\nparties. It is the irresponsible actions of  these\r\n\r\nreckless people that raise the degree of risk that\r\n\r\nmoneylenders  have to take. To  cover  this  risk,\r\n\r\nmoneylenders  resort  to all  sorts  of  means  of\r\n\r\nraising  interest illegally. And the poor man  who\r\n\r\nis  desperately in need of money for  a  deserving\r\n\r\ncause, like illness in the family maybe, will have\r\n\r\nto  suffer  the same consequences as the  reckless\r\n\r\ngambler.  Bearing  this  in  mind  for   a   later\r\n\r\nimprovement   on   the   Bill,   I   support    it\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point for the Government to bear in mind\r\n\r\nin connection with this Bill is that the very poor\r\n\r\npeople, who have no status to support them and may\r\n\r\nfind   it   very  difficult  to  get  loans   from\r\n\r\nmoneylenders, go to pawnshops with articles  which\r\n\r\nthey  can hardly do without - sometimes as  bad  as\r\n\r\ntheir own coats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  their wives' sarongs - just to tide them over  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  period of, let us say,  illness.  These\r\n\r\nare  the  people who deserve pity  and  should  be\r\n\r\nhelped. And these are the people who are paying 24\r\n\r\nper cent interest on a loan, sometimes 30 per cent\r\n\r\nif  the  loan is less than $5, as against  12  per\r\n\r\ncent  as  provided  in the Moneylenders  Bill  for\r\n\r\nsecured debts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope in the spirit of this Moneylenders\r\n\r\nBill,  the  Government will consider in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture  amending the pawnbrokers' rate of interest\r\n\r\nto  bring it to a fairer balance with that of  the\r\n\r\nMoneylenders Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, whenever we hear the word \"moneylender\",  two\r\n\r\ncommunities are associated with it, even  if  they\r\n\r\nare good - the chettiars and the Sikhs. If we have a\r\n\r\ngood  Sikh  friend  who visits the  house,  people\r\n\r\naround would think that we are borrowing money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from my point of view as a\r\n\r\nworker, I would like to stress a particular point.\r\n\r\nIn  the  trade union movement, it is usual to  see\r\n\r\npickets  before an office when they are on  strike\r\n\r\nto  fight the employers. But on pay days, Sir,  we\r\n\r\nsee  two  kinds of picketing without  placards - one\r\n\r\nwith  a  turban and beard, and the  other  with  a\r\n\r\ndhoti  and an umbrella. Such picketing can  always\r\n\r\nbe  seen in front of Government offices, the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  the  Harbour Board, or  any  other  well\r\n\r\nestablished  offices, on any pay day  at  about  4\r\n\r\no'clock, and the pickets are waiting for borrowers\r\n\r\nto  come  forth from offices. And these  employees\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are  badly  in need  of  money  easily\r\n\r\nsuccumb  to the grip of the moneylenders, who  use\r\n\r\nnice words, and show no interest in recovering the\r\n\r\nprincipal  loan, but simply say, \"Kalau wan  tidak\r\n\r\nada wang, ta'apa. Baya bunga dahulu.\" [If you have\r\n\r\nno money, it does not matter. Paying interest will\r\n\r\ndo.]  Mr Speaker, Sir, if a man borrows $200,  he\r\n\r\nmight  agree  to  pay the moneylender  12  monthly\r\n\r\ninstalments of $30 each to clear the debt. And  if\r\n\r\nthe  man  is financially tight on a pay  day,  the\r\n\r\nmoneylender  would usually pay him  $10  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Kalau\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntuan ta'apa wang, ta'apa. Sim pan dahulu.\" [If you\r\n\r\nhave no money, it does not matter. Keep it first.]\r\n\r\nThis  $20  is paid as interest only, and  this  is\r\n\r\ncarried  on for years, and the capital remains  as\r\n\r\nit  is - $200.  And  therefore the  moneylender,  in\r\n\r\nabout four years, would have collected about  $800\r\n\r\nas   interest  with  a  capital  of   $200   still\r\n\r\noutstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about moneylending, there are many\r\n\r\ncultural  traditions that Indians have brought  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaya. Among these is  the  money-lending  culture. Of the Sikh community,  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nyou  look through the passport of a Sikh who comes\r\n\r\nto  Malaya,  never  can you find their  occupation\r\n\r\nstated as moneylender; almost all come for jobs - as\r\n\r\njagas,  or watchmen. And wherever they work,  they\r\n\r\nbegin   lending   money,  and  accumulate   money.\r\n\r\nSometimes  they form a money-lending  association,\r\n\r\nand  usually  we find that about 99  per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthese Sikh moneylenders are not licensed. If  they\r\n\r\ncannot  find a borrower in his office, they  would\r\n\r\ngo  straight to his home. And if he is not  there,\r\n\r\nthey  would  intimidate his wife  and  say,  \"Look\r\n\r\nhere,  if you are not going to pay my interest,  I\r\n\r\nam going to prosecute your husband.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, when a man is employed,\r\n\r\nhe  cannot do any money-lending business. But this\r\n\r\nis going on in Singapore; there are people working\r\n\r\nand  also doing moneylending business. So when  we\r\n\r\ncombat   these   two   types  of  moneylenders - the\r\n\r\nchettiar community and the Sikh community - I should\r\n\r\nsay  that  the  chettiars are more reasonable  and\r\n\r\nhave consideration for the borrowers' difficulties\r\n\r\nthan  the Sikhs. Mr Speaker, Sir, the law  states\r\n\r\nthat  for  a loan of more than $100, it should  be\r\n\r\npaid  by a crossed cheque and, as the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Mountbatten  has just mentioned,  maybe  some\r\n\r\nbargaining  may  be  made in the  signing  of  the\r\n\r\ndocuments, such as after the borrower has got  the\r\n\r\nmoney from the bank he must pay to the moneylender\r\n\r\nwhatever  difference he has agreed to pay  between\r\n\r\nthe stated loan and actual sum received. In such a\r\n\r\ncase it is up to the borrower\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhimself  to  decide, once he has got  the  crossed\r\n\r\ncheque,   whether  or  not  he  should   pay   the\r\n\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point which I am strongly in favour of in the\r\n\r\nBill  is the prohibition of moneylenders besieging\r\n\r\nplaces of employment or residence. As it is, these\r\n\r\nmoneylenders would not allow the borrowers to  sit\r\n\r\nin  their offices, to go to their houses, or  even\r\n\r\nto  a coffeeshop to drink coffee. That is the main\r\n\r\nthing.  If  a  man needs money, he  can  go  as  a\r\n\r\ngentleman  to a licensed moneylender  and  sign  a\r\n\r\nloan, because the moneylender has a furnished  and\r\n\r\nlicensed office with a notice board. So this is  a\r\n\r\nvery good clause. And even if the rate of interest\r\n\r\nis  18 per cent or 12 per cent, it is in line with\r\n\r\nthe Federation's policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when this Bill is passed, most of the\r\n\r\nunlicensed  moneylenders now would  be  unable  to\r\n\r\nissue summons for past contracts. In the past, the\r\n\r\nborrowers just signed promissory notes with  which\r\n\r\nthe moneylenders could sue them and say, \"Look, if\r\n\r\nyou  are not going to pay, I will summon you.  So,\r\n\r\nif  you  cannot  pay all, you had better  pay  the\r\n\r\ninterest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is a great\r\n\r\nrelief  for  the  workers, and it  is  my  earnest\r\n\r\nbelief  that  the majority of the workers  support\r\n\r\nthe Government on this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly support this\r\n\r\nMoneylenders  Bill,  moved  by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour   and  Law.  Indeed  there  are  still   in\r\n\r\nSingapore many unscrupulous moneylenders who  hold\r\n\r\nthe  poor  people in their clutches. We know,  and\r\n\r\nthe   general   public   knows   too,   that   the\r\n\r\nmoneylenders, licensed and unlicensed, are  cinema\r\n\r\nattendants, godown jagas, and many other watchmen,\r\n\r\nwho  are  also prepared to lend money to the  poor\r\n\r\npeople, and suck the blood of the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is another point I would like to mention. I know about this matter personally.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a man borrows $100, but he signs for\r\n\r\na loan of $200. The borrower accepts the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterms  because  of  forced  circumstances,  or  of\r\n\r\nhardship. But the moneylender has no pity or mercy\r\n\r\nfor the poor or those who are in need of help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker. When the time for\r\n\r\npayment  comes, i.e. at the end of the month - as  I\r\n\r\npersonally have witnessed or known - almost in every\r\n\r\noffice in Singapore the moneylenders would wait in\r\n\r\na   long   queue,  reminiscent  of  the   Japanese\r\n\r\noccupation when there were long queues to purchase\r\n\r\ncigarettes,  with people pushing here  and  there.\r\n\r\nThese  moneylenders would queue up in that  manner\r\n\r\nin order to recover money loaned to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nThis,  if left unchecked, will, I think, not  only\r\n\r\nbe  detrimental to the borrowers but also  to  the\r\n\r\nmoneylenders.  It  may be that the  borrowers  are\r\n\r\nworking  for  a certain employer and the  employer\r\n\r\nwill  no  doubt  act,  with  a  dismissal  of  the\r\n\r\nemployee. With the Bill moved by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law, I believe and I am confident  that\r\n\r\nthis  will  bring  about  an  improvement  to  the\r\n\r\nconditions  for the benefit of both  the  borrower\r\n\r\nand  the  lender.  And another  factor  that  also\r\n\r\nstrengthens the case for approval of this Bill  is\r\n\r\nthat  it can educate those people who are  in  the\r\n\r\nhabit  of  borrowing money from moneylenders,  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  moneylenders will come to  realise  the\r\n\r\nhardship  of  the  borrowers and  abide  by  these\r\n\r\nregulations.  There is a certain  section  of  the\r\n\r\npeople who do not have difficulty in getting food,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, but nevertheless they land themselves\r\n\r\nin  difficulties;  not because  of  the  force  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  but because they  want  to  attend\r\n\r\ncinema  shows or purchase luxuries. And  there  is\r\n\r\nanother  section  who  wish  to  observe  marriage\r\n\r\ntraditions and fulfil certain obligations to their\r\n\r\nbrothers or sisters and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am confident that if this Bill is enforced, I am sure the moneylenders who are\r\n\r\nalways  lending money will realise the  conditions\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten  just now asked why it  was  that  the\r\n\r\nBill did not require loans of less than $100 to be\r\n\r\nmade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  way  of  a crossed cheque. She suggested  that\r\n\r\nsuch an omission would defeat the very purposes of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  in the sense that this Bill  has  been\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  protect borrowers of small  sums.  I\r\n\r\nwould remind the Member for Mount-batten that  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the people who are held in thrall  by\r\n\r\nthe moneylenders are poor people, and most of them\r\n\r\nare  the  people who take loans of less than  $100\r\n\r\nfrom  unscrupulous moneylenders. It has  been  the\r\n\r\npractice  in  the past for these moneylenders  who\r\n\r\nlend  sums of less than $100 to these poor  people\r\n\r\nto  require  them  to  sign promissory  notes  for\r\n\r\nlarger amounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that will not be possible under this\r\n\r\npresent  Bill  because  the moneylenders  will  be\r\n\r\nforced  to  enter a sum of less than $100  on  the\r\n\r\nnote and cannot require them to sign for more.  If\r\n\r\nhe requires them to sign for more, he will have to\r\n\r\npay them by way of a crossed cheque, and it is for\r\n\r\nthat reason that loans for less than $100 are  not\r\n\r\nrequired to be made by crossed cheques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other point that the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten has made. She said, and I  agree  with\r\n\r\nher, that this Bill itself is not likely to put  a\r\n\r\nstop    to   fraudulent   practices   and    other\r\n\r\nmalpractices   on   the   part   of   unscrupulous\r\n\r\nmoneylenders. If she knows of other  dodges  which\r\n\r\nare  being  used  to defeat the purposes  of  this\r\n\r\nBill, I would invite her to bring these dodges  to\r\n\r\nthe  attention of the Government. I can assure her\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  introduce, if necessary,  amending\r\n\r\nlegislation to put a stop to these dodges, because\r\n\r\nwe   are   determined  to  see  that   all   these\r\n\r\nmalpractices are put an end to immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Byrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 7 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, line 3, after \"months\", to insert \"or\r\n\r\nto both such fine and imprisonment\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, Sir, is to provide for the\r\n\r\nimposition  of both a fine and an imprisonment  in\r\n\r\nappropriate cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 to 15 inclusive ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 10, line 31, after \"principal;\", to\r\n\r\ninsert-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(c) the amount paid to the borrower or (where\r\n\r\nthere is more than one borrower) to each of\r\n\r\nthe borrowers;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the amount payable by the borrower or each\r\n\r\nof the borrowers and by the surety or each of\r\n\r\nthe sureties;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment is to provide\r\n\r\nthat the notes or memorandum shall, where there is\r\n\r\nmore  than one borrower, show the amount  paid  to\r\n\r\neach  of  the borrowers and the amount payable  by\r\n\r\neach of the borrowers or sureties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a note in page 10, line\r\n\r\n32,  to leave out \"(c)\" and insert \"(e)\".

M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects of this Bill are simple and\r\n\r\nstraightforward. The Bill is designed to indemnify\r\n\r\nthose  persons  who, acting in good  faith,  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  property  erroneously assumed  to  be  enemy\r\n\r\nproperty  and also to provide for the disposal  of\r\n\r\nin, come  derived  from enemy property,  and  any\r\n\r\ncopyright  of an enemy nature infringed  owing  to\r\n\r\nthe  War. The Bill is based on the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nEnemy Property Act, 1953, and follows in the  main\r\n\r\nthe Federation Enemy Property Ordinance, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom Act has three main purposes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To indemnify persons who dealt with property\r\n\r\nerroneously assumed to be enemy property, provided\r\n\r\nthey  were  acting in good faith and in  purported\r\n\r\ncompliance  with  the  Trading  with   the   Enemy\r\n\r\nlegislation. Titles to such property actually sold\r\n\r\nare  validated  but  the real  owner's  rights  to\r\n\r\nrecover  the  property are protected  when  it  is\r\n\r\nstill  in  the custodian's hands or  when  it  was\r\n\r\nleased to an ostensible owner without payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. It provides for the disposal of income from\r\n\r\nenemy property. This income is used, first, to pay\r\n\r\ninterest in respect of property erroneously  taken\r\n\r\ninto custody. The balance of the income is paid to\r\n\r\nthe exchequer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. It provides protection in the case of\r\n\r\ninfringement of German-owned copyright for the use\r\n\r\nof   German-owned  patents  and  designs  and  for\r\n\r\ntransactions  involving reparation materials  sent\r\n\r\nfrom  Germany  to  the United  Kingdom,  where  no\r\n\r\nlegislative saction or authority existed for  such\r\n\r\ninfringement, use or transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason why claims may arise is because\r\n\r\nof   the  peculiar  difficulty  in  war  time   of\r\n\r\ndetermining what was enemy property and  what  was\r\n\r\nnot.  The  definition of enemy  property  depended\r\n\r\nupon the residence of the owner regardless of  his\r\n\r\nown  nationality, because if the owner  was  under\r\n\r\nenemy control, his property might be available  to\r\n\r\nthe  enemy. Consequently when owners moved between\r\n\r\nenemy   and   neutral  countries,   or   companies\r\n\r\noperating  in  enemy territory were controlled  by\r\n\r\nother  companies in neutral territory,  there  was\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  determining the  status  of  their\r\n\r\nproperty.  The  rule  was  adopted  that  property\r\n\r\nshould be treated as enemy property when there was\r\n\r\nany   doubt  as  to  its  true  status.  In  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, mistakes were inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the factors leading to the passing of the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  Act  are  similar  to  those   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there are other factors  to  be  taken\r\n\r\ninto  account. The most important is the  fact  of\r\n\r\nthe Japanese occupation and the confusion cause by\r\n\r\nit,  together  with  the  considerable  amount  of\r\n\r\nlegislation passed in Singapore to deal  with  its\r\n\r\nafter-effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of the Bill therefore specifically\r\n\r\nincludes  the  Custodian of Property Proclamation,\r\n\r\nthe Custodian of Property (Vesting) Ordinance, and\r\n\r\nthe Custodian of Property Ordinance as legislation\r\n\r\nauthorising  dealings  with  enemy  property,   or\r\n\r\nproperty  which was assumed to be enemy  property.\r\n\r\nThe Bill will provide indemnities for dealings  in\r\n\r\nsuch   property  which  was  in  fact  not   enemy\r\n\r\nproperty.  It  has  not  been  necessary  to  make\r\n\r\nspecial   provision  in  respect  of  patents   in\r\n\r\nindustrial  designs, because registers of  patents\r\n\r\nand  designs  in Singapore are mere extensions  of\r\n\r\nthe English registers. Consequently,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  protection  afforded by  the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nEnemy Property Act against claims by the owners of\r\n\r\npatents  and designs, whose rights were  infringed\r\n\r\nduring  the  War, apply equally to individuals  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   and   in  the  United   Kingdom.   The\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the United Kingdom Enemy  Property\r\n\r\nAct relating to copyrights and disclosure of trade\r\n\r\nsecrets have been included in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom when property was\r\n\r\nerroneously taken into custody and later  restored\r\n\r\nto  the  owner,  interest was paid  to  cover  the\r\n\r\nperiod of seizure by the Custodian. With regard to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  however, it is proposed that  interest\r\n\r\nshould be paid only from the date of resumption of\r\n\r\nCivil  Government on the 1st April, 1946,  or  the\r\n\r\ndate  when  the  property was taken into  custody,\r\n\r\nwhichever is the later. This proposal is  in  line\r\n\r\nwith  the  policy adopted in connection  with  the\r\n\r\nmoratorium. During the Occupation and until  Civil\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  resumed, it was not  possible  to\r\n\r\nadminister enemy property nor to return to  owners\r\n\r\nproperty erroneously taken under control. Just  as\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  loss caused by the  Occupation  was\r\n\r\nplaced  upon  the  owners  as  a  result  of   the\r\n\r\nmoratorium,  so  some of the loss  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nproperty seized by the Custodian should also  fall\r\n\r\non  the owners. It is proposed that interest shall\r\n\r\nbe   payable,   following   the   United   Kingdom\r\n\r\nprecedent,  only on property that was never  enemy\r\n\r\nproperty at any time. Interest on the property  of\r\n\r\nallies  and  others taken into custody when  their\r\n\r\ncountries  were  occupied  by  the  enemy  is  not\r\n\r\npayable  to  the  owners.  The  reason  for   this\r\n\r\ndecision  is  that,  in very many  instances,  the\r\n\r\namount  payable would be trivial and the  work  of\r\n\r\ncalculating  the interest for varying  periods  on\r\n\r\nsmall     but    numerous    sums     would     be\r\n\r\ndisproportionately costly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to draw special attention to a\r\n\r\nmajor  deviation  from  the  United  Kingdom  Act.\r\n\r\nClause  12  (2)  of the Bill provides  that  where\r\n\r\nproperty   is  taken  into  custody  as  non-enemy\r\n\r\nproperty under the Custodian of Property Ordinance\r\n\r\nand  the proceeds of the realisation paid into the\r\n\r\nWar  Damage  Fund,  such payment  was  not  to  be\r\n\r\ndisturbed even though the true owner may  be  able\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestablish his claim to the property. Clause 12 (3)\r\n\r\napplies  the  same rule to property  certified  as\r\n\r\nenemy  property under section 24 of the  Custodian\r\n\r\nof  Enemy Property Ordinance where the identity of\r\n\r\nthe owner could not be established at the date  of\r\n\r\ntaking  it  into  custody.

As conditions exist at the present\r\n\r\ntime,   the   aim  and  objective   of   such   an\r\n\r\nestablishment  is  not to apply massage;  but  the\r\n\r\nobject is sinister, that is, to make it a place of\r\n\r\nprostitution; because Mr Speaker, as  a  masseur,\r\n\r\none must be qualified - one must know, for instance,\r\n\r\nenough about blood circulation.

The Criminal Procedure Code thus\r\n\r\nprovides  for a fine to be levied by distress  and\r\n\r\nsale  of  the property belonging to the  offender.\r\n\r\nBut  this provision has remained a dead letter  as\r\n\r\nthe Criminal District and Magistrate's Courts have\r\n\r\nno facilities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand no officials to levy such distress.

The aggrieved wife would in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  case have to go to the District Court  to\r\n\r\nseek  enforcement  of  the order  of  the  Shariah\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to give power to the Court,\r\n\r\nincluding the Shariah Court, to make an attachment\r\n\r\nof  earnings  order, to make it  mandatory  on  an\r\n\r\nemployer  to  deduct the amount of the maintenance\r\n\r\nallowance  from  the  wages  or  other  periodical\r\n\r\npayments  made  to the person liable  to  pay  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance, and to pay such sums into the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"earnings\" is comprehensive,\r\n\r\nand,  in  short,  this legislation  will  make  it\r\n\r\neasier   for   wives   and  children   to   obtain\r\n\r\nmaintenance due to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, we have paid special  attention\r\n\r\nto  this  Bill before it is passed.

It  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  them to find employment.  Even  if\r\n\r\nthey  can find employment there is nobody to  look\r\n\r\nafter their children at home. In view of all these\r\n\r\ndifficulties and inconveniences, we have therefore\r\n\r\ndecided to pass this Maintenance Bill. The passing\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill is of great significance.

We, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Government, should introduce this Bill because\r\n\r\nthis  is  one of the methods to protect women  and\r\n\r\nchildren  who  have  hitherto been  victimised  by\r\n\r\ntheir  own  husbands and fathers  for  the  simple\r\n\r\nreason  that  their parents have  neglected  them.\r\n\r\nAlthough  at  the moment the Court  has  power  to\r\n\r\norder  the  fathers to pay maintenance  for  their\r\n\r\nwives  and children whom they have deserted,  some\r\n\r\nof  them have failed to comply with the orders  as\r\n\r\ninstructed  by  the Court. Therefore,  we  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have made provision in  this  Bill  so\r\n\r\nthat employers are obliged to deduct the wages  of\r\n\r\nthe  husbands of these women. Now, the Court  will\r\n\r\nknow  the wages the husbands are drawing, and  not\r\n\r\nas  in  the  past,  where in certain  cases  false\r\n\r\ninformation was given. This serves a good purpose.\r\n\r\nIf this Bill is put into operation, every employer\r\n\r\nwill have to pay the maintenance money due by  his\r\n\r\nemployee direct to the wife or the children by way\r\n\r\nof  deduction from his wages. This is  good.  This\r\n\r\nwill  ensure protection and safeguard for the wife\r\n\r\nand  the children. Otherwise, how could the  wives\r\n\r\nlook  after  the  welfare of their children?

Men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  should be put on an equal footing  both  in\r\n\r\nemployment and in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can reflect for a while that in the 140 years\r\n\r\nof  colonialism in this country, women  have  been\r\n\r\noppressed. Therefore, whether in family life or in\r\n\r\nemployment, they have lost their opportunity. When\r\n\r\nwomen  are oppressed in the family, and forced  by\r\n\r\ntheir husbands to get a divorce, an order from the\r\n\r\nCourt  for  maintenance is not in the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe women but in the interest of the children. The\r\n\r\norder for maintenance is made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  a view to looking after the interest of  the\r\n\r\nchildren  and  not of the women themselves.  Their\r\n\r\nproblem is decided by the Court. But we have  seen\r\n\r\nthat the husbands who are ordered by the Court  to\r\n\r\npay     maintenance     have     avoided     their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. We cannot allow  this  condition\r\n\r\nto go on. The Government in its Five-Year Plan has\r\n\r\nstated  that it will see to it that women are  put\r\n\r\non  an  equal  footing with men.  But  during  the\r\n\r\ntransition  period, we have to think of  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans to maintain their legal position. Under  the\r\n\r\npresent  circumstances,  they  are  victimised  by\r\n\r\nthose   persons  who  are  avoiding  their   legal\r\n\r\nresponsibility towards their family. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nthink that the passing of this Bill today is  very\r\n\r\nproper, and will solve the maintenance problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, there is no reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill according read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Byrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 6 inclusive ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, line 24, to leave out \"employees\" and\r\n\r\ninsert \"employers\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an obvious mistake, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8 and 9 ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, line 36, to leave out \"following\" and\r\n\r\ninsert \"falling\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mistake also is obvious, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 12 ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with amendments; read the Third\r\n\r\ntime and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> I second the motion.\r\n\r\n                  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MALAYAN CULTURE AND THE ENGLISH-EDUCATED</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, may I refer you to \"The Tasks Ahead\", Part 1,\r\n\r\npage 12, second paragraph, where the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Of the inevitability of a Malayan nation, we\r\n\r\nare  convinced.

But the attempt was  not  entirely\r\n\r\nsuccessful, for there still exists in Singapore  a\r\n\r\npeople  called  Peranakans.

There are  Chinese,\r\n\r\nMalay,   Boyanese,  Eurasian,  Indian   and   Arab\r\n\r\nPeranakans. As a matter of fact, two nights ago  I\r\n\r\nmet  some  Arabs.  They were  too  proud  to  call\r\n\r\nthemselves    Peranakans.    These    non-communal\r\n\r\nPeranakans  from the different social  strata  are\r\n\r\nindeed  the  sons  of the soil and  have  to  some\r\n\r\ndegree  been  successful in developing  a  Malayan\r\n\r\nlanguage, custom, tradition and culture. They  are\r\n\r\nthe  people  who,  having adapted  themselves  and\r\n\r\nrisen  to  meet the needs of Singapore at  a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the  value of English education was scarcely\r\n\r\nrecognised, and realising that the prosperity of a\r\n\r\ncolonially  governed  Singapore  depended  on  the\r\n\r\nability  of  the people to be able to read,  speak\r\n\r\nand  write the language of the ruling race, worked\r\n\r\nhard    to    equip    themselves    with    those\r\n\r\nqualifications, while the others  were  busy  over\r\n\r\ntheir  trading  to make money to  send  abroad  to\r\n\r\ntheir  homeland.  Did  these  wealth-seekers   who\r\n\r\nreaped  Singapore's harvests  just  to  send  them\r\n\r\nabroad,  help to build Singapore? No.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nPeranakans  who, though comprising several  races,\r\n\r\nfor    various    reasons,   some    because    of\r\n\r\nintermarriage,  have  decided  to  make  Singapore\r\n\r\ntheir homeland.

No.  The  English  schools\r\n\r\nknowingly or unknowingly were helping to kill  it.\r\n\r\nIn  the  early  20th  century, pupils  of  English\r\n\r\nschools  were  discouraged  from  speaking   their\r\n\r\nmother tongue. In some schools (I happened  to  be\r\n\r\nin one of them) the pupils were even fined if they\r\n\r\nspoke in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  vernacular.  And when they  talked  of  their\r\n\r\ncustoms,  traditions and superstitions especially,\r\n\r\nthey  were looked upon as queer and even  made  to\r\n\r\nlook  silly. Eventually, these students learnt  to\r\n\r\naccept  the fact that the only language or culture\r\n\r\nworth  being proud of is the Western language  and\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy then that in spite of this,\r\n\r\nthey  have not, as the Prime Minister remarked  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech at the Union of Journalists  luncheon,\r\n\r\n\"taken  to the English set of values and  ideals\".\r\n\r\nWhen the Prime Minister said \"the English-educated\r\n\r\nare  divided, almost emasculated as  a  result  of\r\n\r\ndeculturalisation\", I am sure he was not referring\r\n\r\nto  the Peranakans, because, in my opinion, all is\r\n\r\nnot  yet lost with the Peranakans. There are still\r\n\r\ntraces  and  remnants  of this  Malayan  culture,\r\n\r\nalthough outmoded and ignored today. Those who are\r\n\r\njealous of the privileges that the Peranakans have\r\n\r\nearned  through their foresight, their loyalty  to\r\n\r\nSingapore and the trouble they have taken to equip\r\n\r\nthemselves for the position they now hold may deny\r\n\r\nthat  there was such a Malayan nation and culture.\r\n\r\nBut even those jealous people cannot deny that the\r\n\r\npeople  who have in the course of over  100  years\r\n\r\ndeveloped a language, literature, drama, songs and\r\n\r\ndances,   traditions,  customs,   costumes,   hair\r\n\r\nstyles, cuisine, games and religion of their  own,\r\n\r\nhave  the right to claim that they have founded  a\r\n\r\nMalayan nation and culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine these claims one by one. Let us\r\n\r\nfirst take up their claim on language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon.

The people of\r\n\r\nKelantan  and Trengganu speak a dialect  different\r\n\r\nfrom  that  spoken  in Johore  or  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nHokkien in Penang is different from the Hokkien in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Therefore, there is no reason  why  the\r\n\r\nPeranakans in Singapore should not be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowed  to speak the dialect of Malay  that  they\r\n\r\nnow   have  in  Singapore.  If  Hokkien,  Teochew,\r\n\r\nCantonese  and all the different Chinese  dialects\r\n\r\ncan  be spoken without prejudice to Mandarin being\r\n\r\nthe  national  language,  then  why  cannot  these\r\n\r\ndifferent states-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mandarin is not the national\r\n\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> No, it is the national\r\n\r\nChinese language. Why cannot the different  states\r\n\r\nof  Malaya,  Singapore  as well,  have  their  own\r\n\r\ndialects  in  Malay - each state  speaking  its  own\r\n\r\nMalay  without  prejudice to  the  \"Bahasa\"  Malay\r\n\r\nbeing  the  national  literary  Malayan  language?\r\n\r\nAfter  all,  this Malay that the Peranakans  speak\r\n\r\nhas  been  generally accepted by many races.  Many\r\n\r\nraces  are  speaking  it.  In  fact,  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nunderstand it better than the real Malay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also thought it a strange thing that the English-educated Chinese from\r\n\r\nMalaya should find more in common with the English-educated  non-Chinese  in  Malaya  than  with  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated Chinese from other countries. For\r\n\r\nme,  I  do not think there is anything strange  in\r\n\r\nthat.  I  feel that it is further proof  of  their\r\n\r\nloyalty  to Singapore and their sense of a Malayan\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to literature, legends from China\r\n\r\nhave  been  translated into this Peranakan  Malay.\r\n\r\nBibles  and  hymns  are also  translated  in  this\r\n\r\nMalay.  The pantun Peranakan is still very popular\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  amongst the Peranakans,  especially\r\n\r\namong the Chinese Peranakans, and their poems  and\r\n\r\nproverbs  are  also translated  in  the  Peranakan\r\n\r\nMalay.  Many  of these proverbs and poems  can  be\r\n\r\ntraced  back  to Malay literature; a  few  are  of\r\n\r\nChinese origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for songs and dances, we have already been\r\n\r\ntold  recently  by  an expert from  Radio  Malaya,\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur, that the kronchong was  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nand  Indonesian origin and the ronggeng, which  is\r\n\r\nvery    popular   among   Chinese   and   Eurasian\r\n\r\nPeranakans, has a Portuguese origin. Though  in  a\r\n\r\nvery amateurish fashion, the Peranakans have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattempted a small operetta called the \"Chik Siti\".\r\n\r\nIt  is  very  amateurish, I admit.  But  it  is  a\r\n\r\nnucleus  to start with and a foundation  to  build\r\n\r\nup.  The  Peranakan songs were very  popular  once\r\n\r\nupon a time. In fact, I believe there is a club in\r\n\r\nSingapore which tries to keep this culture  alive.\r\n\r\nThey  meet regularly and they get together to sing\r\n\r\nthese songs so as to keep them alive. Such efforts\r\n\r\nto  keep  the  culture of their forefathers  alive\r\n\r\nshould, I think, receive encouragement. As for the\r\n\r\ndrama,  again  I  suppose  the  plays  are  of  an\r\n\r\namateurish  fashion. Yes! But  the  Peranakans  do\r\n\r\nhave  their Wayang Peranakan which is very popular\r\n\r\namongst  not  only  Chinese  Peranakans  but  also\r\n\r\namongst  very many races. I am sure the Government\r\n\r\nwould  do  well and would be doing  a  service  to\r\n\r\nMalayan culture if they were to try and raise  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  what has been going on  rather  than\r\n\r\nlook  down upon it with contempt, as the  Colonial\r\n\r\nSingapore was inclined to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their customs and hair styles here are a classic\r\n\r\nexample of the Peranakans selecting the best  from\r\n\r\nthe  different  races and making  it  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nfashion.  The sarong is of Malay origin; the  long\r\n\r\ndress, not that of today [I am talking of what  we\r\n\r\ncall  the old fashioned dress which is of  Sumatra\r\n\r\norigin and the head-dress] is a copy of one of the\r\n\r\nChinese  hair  styles. These  have  made  such  an\r\n\r\nattractive  combination that years  ago  not  only\r\n\r\nChinese  Peranakans but Eurasian and Indian  women\r\n\r\nalso  wore these costumes. In fact, even today  we\r\n\r\nfind  Eurasian  and Indian and also  some  Chinese\r\n\r\nwomen  wearing them - very few, but there are  still\r\n\r\nsome.  And  the  strange  thing  is,  whereas   in\r\n\r\neveryday wear the dress is of Malayan origin,  the\r\n\r\nheaddress  is  of Chinese origin,  in  the  bridal\r\n\r\ntrousseau,  the grander and richer Chinese  bridal\r\n\r\ncostume has been adopted, and the hair style which\r\n\r\nis  partly of Malayan and partly Indonesian origin\r\n\r\nwith  a touch of the Siamese in the jewellery worn\r\n\r\non the hair has been selected to go with the grand\r\n\r\nChinese costume of the bride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for customs, here again is something which is\r\n\r\nvery  peculiar  and  unique  amongst  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nPeranakans,  or as they sometimes term themselves,\r\n\r\n\"Singaporeans\".  To  quote  one  example,   in   a\r\n\r\nwedding,  besides  the real  parents,  the  bridal\r\n\r\ncouple have to have ceremonial parents. The  bride\r\n\r\nhas  to have a ceremonial mother who has to  be  a\r\n\r\nChinese Singaporean or a Chinese Peranakan  woman,\r\n\r\nbut the bridegroom has to have a ceremonial father\r\n\r\nwho  preferably  has to be a  Malay  or  at  least\r\n\r\ndressed in Malay traditional costume. This is  out\r\n\r\nof date now. Very few people marry in this fashion\r\n\r\nnow  but  it was the fashion some time ago.  As  I\r\n\r\nsaid,   the  customs  and  traditions   of   these\r\n\r\nPeranakans have been looked down upon as something\r\n\r\nqueer and not something to be proud about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have not related all this just to\r\n\r\nentertain  the hon. Members of the  House  or  the\r\n\r\ngallery-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You want to revive it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> - but I have made an attempt\r\n\r\nto  show  that  the synthetising of  cultures  and\r\n\r\ncustoms  which the Minister for Culture  hopes  to\r\n\r\nfoster  had  already begun to take  shape  over  a\r\n\r\nhundred  years ago, and that it is ideal to  build\r\n\r\non this foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is already very late and if I were to\r\n\r\ndescribe some of the Peranakan dishes, they  might\r\n\r\nmake  us feel hungry. So let it suffice for me  to\r\n\r\nsay that the Peranakan cuisine, though obviously a\r\n\r\nconglomeration of Malayan, Indonesian, Indian  and\r\n\r\nChinese cuisine, is unique in taste and flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for religion, here again the non-communal\r\n\r\nspirit can be seen. Every ninth month of the year,\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese Peranakans especially - there are  some\r\n\r\nEurasians  and some Indians too - go to Kusu  Island\r\n\r\nand worship the kramat. Now, opposite the building\r\n\r\nthat houses the kramat is the building that houses\r\n\r\nwhat is called the \"Tua Peh Kong\" [Laughter]. I do\r\n\r\nnot  know why there is so much laughter about what\r\n\r\nhas  been  done for so many years. After  all,  we\r\n\r\nshould respect the customs of the people of  those\r\n\r\ntimes, especially those of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  forefathers. The main fact is that  they  are\r\n\r\nnon-communal  and  they  worship  in  a   building\r\n\r\nhousing  a  Malay kramat and also the Chinese  Tua\r\n\r\nPeh  Kong.  This is an example of the non-communal\r\n\r\nspirit that existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Straits Times, the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nreferring to the English-educated, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In the past, said Mr Lee, they have been most\r\n\r\nfavourably placed and treated in colonial  Malaya.\r\n\r\nThe British not unnaturally preferred to deal with\r\n\r\npeople  who  could  speak their language  and  who\r\n\r\nunderstood their manners and mannerisms. Therefore\r\n\r\nthe  English  educated have risen to  the  highest\r\n\r\npositions both in Government service and in  their\r\n\r\nprofessions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, this is further proof of the intelligence  of\r\n\r\nthose  people  at that time, who  knew  what  they\r\n\r\nneeded  to get to those positions. Those were  the\r\n\r\ndays of the colonial government no doubt, not  the\r\n\r\nself-governing  Singapore. The  requirements  then\r\n\r\nwere   different  from  the  requirements   today.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  I am confident, Sir,  that  if  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated  multi-racial   Peranakans   were\r\n\r\ngiven justice, a fair deal and a chance, there  is\r\n\r\nno doubt that they will again rise to the occasion\r\n\r\nand  adapt themselves to the present situation and\r\n\r\nco-operate   with   Government   in   the   social\r\n\r\nrevolution, as the Prime Minister wanted  them  to\r\n\r\ndo. The possibility of this has been manifested by\r\n\r\nthe  remarks  of  the  Prime Minister  of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nTengku  Abdul Rahman, which made headlines in  the\r\n\r\nSunday Mail of 30th August. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\">\"ENGLISH-EDUCATED PRAISED BY TENGKU\"</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They helped me greatly in my job as Premier and\r\n\r\nnever  gave any trouble.

Even the Deputy Prime Minister advocates\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  what is already in  existence  as  a\r\n\r\nbasis, for he was reported in the Straits Times of\r\n\r\n23rd August as saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is important that if we wish to make Malay a\r\n\r\npopular national language in the shortest possible\r\n\r\ntime  then  we  should  use  what  is  already  in\r\n\r\nexistence as a basis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a basis to work on, Sir, It depends on\r\n\r\nwhether we want to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again in \"The Tasks Ahead\", page 12, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture says-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I have no intention  at\r\n\r\nall  to  criticise the Government for the sake  of\r\n\r\ncriticism. I firmly believe that the only  way  an\r\n\r\nOpposition of 8 against 43 can serve the public is\r\n\r\nto   behave   in   a  sincere,  constructive   and\r\n\r\nresponsible mariner, giving credit where credit is\r\n\r\ndue  and  offering constructive criticisms  if  we\r\n\r\nfeel  that  they are in the paramount interest  of\r\n\r\nthe people. I fully realise that we can never hope\r\n\r\nto  out-vote  the Government and my only  hope  is\r\n\r\nthat  Government  will  reciprocate  our  sincere,\r\n\r\nconstructive and responsible behaviour with a fair\r\n\r\nand  reasonable attitude, taking our  bouquets  as\r\n\r\nour  sincere compliments and our criticisms as our\r\n\r\nhonest  opinion.  Government need not  necessarily\r\n\r\nconcur  with  our  opinions but they  should  give\r\n\r\ncredit  to  the  fact that there  can  be  another\r\n\r\nschool of thought and that the Opposition although\r\n\r\nrepresenting the minority, democracy demands  that\r\n\r\nwe  be given our chance to express our views which\r\n\r\nshould be given due consideration. I have no doubt\r\n\r\nthat  if  the Opposition behaves in a constructive\r\n\r\nand  responsible  manner, it would  embarrass  any\r\n\r\ndemocratic government to ignore or treat  it  with\r\n\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
