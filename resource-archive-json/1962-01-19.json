The\r\n\r\nreason  for  suggesting a new  headquarters  project\r\n\r\narose  out  of the fact when the present  Government\r\n\r\ntook  office in the middle of 1959, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  found  itself housed in  three  temporary\r\n\r\nstructures  believed  to  have  been  built  by  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  some 20 years ago. With the  expansion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Inspectorate,  we found it necessary  early  in\r\n\r\n1960  to requisition a primary school building  just\r\n\r\nnext  to  the  three temporary structures,  off  Kay\r\n\r\nSiang  Road and Tanglin Road, to house the  enlarged\r\n\r\nInspectorate.  It  is  understood  that  the   three\r\n\r\ntemporary  structures are uneconomical  to  maintain\r\n\r\nand,  therefore, we have to think a little ahead  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the tremendous expansion which we have  to\r\n\r\nundergo in the Ministry of Education, especially  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the Examinations Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For security reasons, it is also essential that\r\n\r\nadequate  measures have to be taken  so  that  there\r\n\r\nwill not be any repetition of leakage of examination\r\n\r\npapers.  If  we  refer to the Four-Year  Development\r\n\r\nPlan  at  page  112,  Table  9.4.  the  headquarters\r\n\r\nproject  would come to a total cost of $1\u00bd  million.\r\n\r\nIt   was  envisaged  to  complete  the  headquarters\r\n\r\nproject  in three years, starting from 1962-3-4.  So\r\n\r\nthe  present provision of half a million dollars  in\r\n\r\n1962 which was passed recently, Sir (page 41 of  the 1962  Development  Estimates, subhead  7),  shows  a\r\n\r\nfigure  of half a million dollars. For this vote  to\r\n\r\naccount   for  1963,  we  feel  that  the  estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for 1962 would amount to  $100,000.  So\r\n\r\nthe 1963 figure would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmean   a  revote  of  $300,000  plus  an  additional\r\n\r\n$200,000.

Member is\r\n\r\nentitled to indicate his points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, from the point of view of\r\n\r\nthe   general  public,  the  present  site  is  most\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory for the headquarters. If a parent has\r\n\r\nto  change buses several times before he reaches his\r\n\r\nplace to see an inspector or any official, it causes\r\n\r\nhim  great inconvenience. And Government policy  has\r\n\r\nbeen to bring the Ministers and their staff near the\r\n\r\npublic!  We  fully  support  it.  That  is  why  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department has been brought  nearer  to\r\n\r\nthe  centre  of the town. Sir, Raffles Institute,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  is  spelt  wrongly. It  should  be  \"Raffles\r\n\r\nInstitution\".  It  has  been  changed   to   Raffles\r\n\r\nInstitute.  Now, Raffles Institution is occupying  a\r\n\r\nvery ancient building. It is very costly to maintain\r\n\r\nthe present building. We know that even after costly\r\n\r\nrenovations,  after a few years  the  building  will\r\n\r\nagain  look  shabby.  We cannot blame  the  building\r\n\r\nbecause  it was built over a century ago.  Would  it\r\n\r\nnot  be  possible, since there was a project before,\r\n\r\nfor  the transfer of Raffles Institution to new  and\r\n\r\nbetter  quarters elsewhere, to have the two projects\r\n\r\nco-ordinated? Maybe Raffles Institution could go  to\r\n\r\nthe   present  site  of  the  Headquarters  and  the\r\n\r\nMinisterial   headquarters  could  go   to   Raffles\r\n\r\nInstitution site. That is a matter which  I  believe\r\n\r\nRafflesians  would be interested in. In, any  case,\r\n\r\nSir,  this is a perennial thing. After a few  years,\r\n\r\nthe  Raffles  Institution building  will  look  very\r\n\r\nshabby as compared with other new buildings that are\r\n\r\nbeing built. I think Raffles Institution deserves  a\r\n\r\nnew set of buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, when the file for the\r\n\r\nrenovation  of  Raffles  Institution,  amounting  to\r\n\r\n$100,000  (the  estimate given by the  Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment) came to me late in 1959 I had  the  same\r\n\r\nfeeling  as  the Member for Tanglin  that  it  might\r\n\r\nperhaps  be a waste of money to spend $100,000  just\r\n\r\nto  renovate  an  old building. Of  course,  it  was\r\n\r\nprevailed upon me that it had a historical  interest\r\n\r\nand old Rafflesians would fight to the last ditch to\r\n\r\npreserve  this building. But I deferred the  matter.\r\n\r\nIn  six months' time it came back again with a  plea\r\n\r\nthat  if  I  did not make a decision on the  matter,\r\n\r\nthen the building might collapse because the windows\r\n\r\nwere  coming  off  at the hinges,  the  stairs  were\r\n\r\ngetting  very  rickety and so  forth.  I  was  still\r\n\r\nadamant  that  we  should spend $100,000  on  a  new\r\n\r\nschool  building. Then the explanation was given  to\r\n\r\nme  that  for  $100,000, we would  be  able  to  get\r\n\r\nRaffles  Institution into good shape  and  also  put\r\n\r\ninto  it  certain new laboratories. It is  certainly\r\n\r\nmuch  cheaper  spending $100,000  carrying  on  with\r\n\r\nRaffles  Institution, which is  centrally  situated,\r\n\r\nfor  at least 2,000 students rather than ponder over\r\n\r\nthe  possibility of erecting a new secondary  school\r\n\r\nthat would cost as much as $600,000 and to wait  for\r\n\r\nperhaps  one  and a half years. So I had  to  agree,\r\n\r\nafter  weighing  all  the  various  advantages   and\r\n\r\ndisadvantages,  to  proceed with  this  project.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  repairs  and  renovations  have  already\r\n\r\nstarted and it is more or less halfway through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no doubt after\r\n\r\na  few years when the time comes for the building to\r\n\r\nbe  again renovated, if the Minister should still be\r\n\r\noccupying   his  post,  he  would  reconsider   this\r\n\r\nquestion after discussing it with the Rafflesians.

When  I  was  more\r\n\r\nintimately  connected  with the  Raffles  Old  Boys'\r\n\r\nAssociation, when the previous Government,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat is, the Lim Yew Hock Government,  made\r\n\r\nthe  decision  to move Raffles Institution  to  some\r\n\r\nother  place  - I think it was in Dunearn Road,  if  I\r\n\r\nremember rightly  - there was a lot of objection  from\r\n\r\nthe  Old Boys' Association and from the old boys  of\r\n\r\nRaffles  School. The old boys felt, quite naturally,\r\n\r\na  sentimental attachment to the original  site  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  should  be  preserved.  I  for  one,  Sir,\r\n\r\nspeaking as an old Rafflesian, would not like to see\r\n\r\nthe   headquarters  of  the  educational  department\r\n\r\nshifted there, not because I do not think it  is  an\r\n\r\nappropriate  site - it is an ideal  site   - but  merely\r\n\r\nbecause  I  would  not like to  see  the  historical\r\n\r\nconnection of the school with the site disturbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of siting for the headquarters,\r\n\r\nSir,  there is opposite to the school itself  across\r\n\r\nthe  road what the City Council preserves as an open\r\n\r\narea. It is next to the Club. I believe the previous\r\n\r\nGovernment had some ideas about erecting a  building\r\n\r\nthere   - a  civic centre and all that sort of  thing.\r\n\r\nBut  that  did not come to pass. That site is  still\r\n\r\navailable.  It  is not earmarked for any  particular\r\n\r\nproject  on the Master Plan. I was wondering whether\r\n\r\nthe  Minister could look into that aspect of  it  to\r\n\r\nsee   whether   that  site  in  front   of   Raffles\r\n\r\nInstitution  across  Beach  Road  might  not  be   a\r\n\r\nsuitable place for the Education Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health and Law, would be very  pleased\r\n\r\nto  hear  this, because that was originally reserved\r\n\r\nfor   the  Health  Ministry,  before  the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry parked itself there.

But I would  urge\r\n\r\nthat  a long-term view be taken of the school  which\r\n\r\nhas  survived for more than a century  and  that  we\r\n\r\nshould have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome   plan   for  the  erection  of  a  substantial\r\n\r\nsecondary  school building which would  replace  the\r\n\r\nexisting building on that site for the same  purpose\r\n\r\nand with the same aim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was going\r\n\r\nto  say the same thing because I feel that it  is  a\r\n\r\nwaste of money if a building is too old and we  keep\r\n\r\non  renovating  it as we are renovating  an  ancient\r\n\r\nmonument.  Today a modern secondary school  requires\r\n\r\nbuildings built along different lines because of the\r\n\r\nemphasis on science. I would suggest that after this\r\n\r\nperiod  when  the  renovation period  is  over,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   should   plan   to   rebuild    Raffles\r\n\r\nInstitution so that in prestige it will be equal  to\r\n\r\nall the bigger schools in Singapore.

As I was connected  with\r\n\r\nthese private streets in the City Council, perhaps I\r\n\r\nmight state what the policy of the City Council was.\r\n\r\nThat might help the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in similar circumstances, there were votes in\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council budgets for these  amounts  which\r\n\r\nwere   recoverable  from  frontagers.  As  and  when\r\n\r\nrequests came in from frontagers that their  private\r\n\r\nstreets  should be made up by the City Council,  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council made them up to certain specifications\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Council insisted upon. Once those  roads\r\n\r\nwere  made  up  to  those specifications,  then  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  declared  them as public streets  and  took\r\n\r\nthem  over,  from  which time  of  declaration  they\r\n\r\nbecame  public streets and thence forward they  were\r\n\r\nrepairable  at the expense of public funds.  That  I\r\n\r\nmust  assume is the position today too. As and  when\r\n\r\nowners  require public streets to be made  up,  this\r\n\r\nparticular  Committee has them made up  and  charges\r\n\r\nthe  cost  to this particular vote and then recovers\r\n\r\nit from the frontagers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now insofar as new development estates are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the  policy which was prevalent  when  I\r\n\r\nleft   the  City  Council  was  that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust insisted that  all  roads  before\r\n\r\ndevelopment took place on a particular site be  made\r\n\r\nup  to  City  Council standards, or to  Rural  Board\r\n\r\nstandards, as the case may be, and before any  house\r\n\r\ncould  be sold the public streets were in fact taken\r\n\r\nover  either  by the City Council or  by  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard as the case may be. So I am assuming that this\r\n\r\n$500,000  is  in respect of present private  streets\r\n\r\nwhich have not as yet been taken over.

T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nyesterday  at the time of adjournment I  was  urging\r\n\r\nGovernment Members to take this debate seriously.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that today they will at least try and  refrain\r\n\r\nfrom  making  frivolous remarks and, as  a  mark  of\r\n\r\nrespect to the Indonesian people, to take the debate\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to show the magnitude and importance which\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian people place on the West Irian issue,\r\n\r\nI  just  want  to  quote from a publication  of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government  entitled  \"West  Irian,   an\r\n\r\nessential part of Indonesia\". On page 21:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This West Irian dispute is likely to become an\r\n\r\nobject of the overall struggle in international\r\n\r\npolitics. West Irian is a vital problem for\r\n\r\nIndonesia which might affect, the basic cause and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our national life and politics.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, Sir, I do not think it is proper for\r\n\r\nanyone of us to take this debate lightly. As I said\r\n\r\nyesterday, the Indonesians take the West Irian issue\r\n\r\nas a very serious issue. It is an issue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  involves  thousands of  people,  and  if  the\r\n\r\npresent  trend  is  kept, inevitably  the  lives  of\r\n\r\nthousands of people will be involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Minister for Culture was trying to\r\n\r\nequate  the  Malaysia plan with the Indonesia  claim\r\n\r\nover  West  Irian.  This is but an  example  of  the\r\n\r\nhollowness of the P.A.P. logic. Briefly  I  want  to\r\n\r\nput an end to this once and for all. I have no doubt\r\n\r\nthat one after another Government speakers are going\r\n\r\nto  come forward with the same line. And the  sooner\r\n\r\nthe  stupidity of this logic is exposed, I think the\r\n\r\nbetter  it will be for all of us. I make this  quite\r\n\r\nclear  to the Government Members  - that if they  want\r\n\r\nto  talk of Malaysia, let us talk of Malaysia at the\r\n\r\ntime the Malaysia motion is debated. This motion  is\r\n\r\nnot  one which involves Malaysia in any way. Neither\r\n\r\nis  this a motion which is sought to give the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to make political capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the position is this: Malaysia is a plan\r\n\r\nwhich  is perhaps British initiated but nevertheless\r\n\r\nbacked by British. Whereas West Irian is not, in the\r\n\r\nfirst   place,  being  freely  given  away  to   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government. The  Indonesian  claim  over\r\n\r\nWest  Irian  is  being resisted with all  the  armed\r\n\r\nmight of the Dutch colonial government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> On a point\r\n\r\nof information, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes, certainly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I take it that the Member will\r\n\r\ngive a solemn undertaking in respect of the Malaysia\r\n\r\nplan, that if the British were to fight us over  the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories, then it becomes an anti-colonial\r\n\r\nstruggle which he will wholeheartedly support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> As I said to the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nyesterday,  I am not interested in arguing  out  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  issue  on this motion.

But there is no  ulterior  motive\r\n\r\nbehind the Indonesian claim over West Irian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the sort of independence through merger\r\n\r\nthat  is  being sold through this Malaysia  idea  is\r\n\r\nfarcical and is not genuine independence. It is riot\r\n\r\na  plan  which would genuinely enforce the principle\r\n\r\nof  self-determination. Whereas, Sir, the Indonesian\r\n\r\ndesire  to  liberate the people  in  West  Irian  is\r\n\r\nfounded   on   the   genuine  principle   of   self-determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on another point of\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He can interrupt when I have finished,\r\n\r\nSir. I just want to get this point across.

Whereas the call to liberate West Irian\r\n\r\nis  the  result of the unanimous wish and desire  of\r\n\r\nthe people of the whole of Indonesia, including West\r\n\r\nIrian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fifth point is unlike what happened in\r\n\r\nSingapore  at the time of separation.  At  the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Dutch decided to retain control  of  West\r\n\r\nIrian, there was resistance from all sections of the\r\n\r\npopulation  in  Indonesia.  As  we  know,  when  the\r\n\r\nBritish  colonial  Government  decided  to  separate\r\n\r\nSingapore from the mainland, there were many people,\r\n\r\nnow  in  key positions in the Federation of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nwho  endorsed  it. Whereas the Indonesians  and  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government resisted the  Dutch  plan  to\r\n\r\nseparate West Irian from Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lastly, to compare the Indonesian claim over\r\n\r\nWest  Irian to Malaysia I think is trying to  insult\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian people.

Sir,  it  is  a  system   that   brings\r\n\r\ndegradation  and  demoralisation, not  only  to  the\r\n\r\nvictims  but  also to the colonial powers.

Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that no one,\r\n\r\nwith  national  spirit and undivided loyally,  could\r\n\r\noppose  any effort of the Indonesian people  to  get\r\n\r\nback  West  Irian  from the Dutch.  The  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nclearly  shown  its  support  for  the  Republic  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia in its demand for West Irian. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nas  explained by the Minister for Culture yesterday,\r\n\r\nan agreement has been signed when the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwent  on a goodwill visit to Indonesia. But on  this\r\n\r\nmotion  moved by the Barisan Sosialis: Is  it  moved\r\n\r\nwith  honest intentions, Mr Speaker, Sir?  For  the\r\n\r\nreasons  given,  if  we follow the  tactics  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, it is clear that this  motion  is\r\n\r\nnot  honest. We can afford to look further. We  only\r\n\r\nhave  to look at the symbol of the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nwhich  is a circle and a star. It is like a crescent\r\n\r\nand  a star. That is the symbol of the Muslims. This\r\n\r\nis confusing to the Muslim religion. The Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis, the Member for Queenstown, has\r\n\r\nalso  said  that this motion is the  decision  of  a\r\n\r\nrally  held in Geylang Serai two weeks ago. Why  has\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis selected  Geylang  Serai  for\r\n\r\nholding  this  rally in order to get a  solution  on\r\n\r\nIrian  Barat? Mr Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis  has\r\n\r\nquite  a  number of times held rallies at  Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang,  Hong  Lim,  and  Paya Lebar,  but  has  never\r\n\r\nmentioned  anything  about Irian  Barat.  They  have\r\n\r\nmentioned   only  phoney  merger  and   second-class\r\n\r\ncitizenship. West Irian and the resolution  made  at\r\n\r\nthe rally in Geylang Serai have been talked about in\r\n\r\nthe  coffee-shops. What the P.A.P. has said,  is  it\r\n\r\nnot  enough? And the resolution taken at the  rally,\r\n\r\nis it not enough?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government of Indonesia through their representatives here require volunteers from here. Has any member of the Barisan Sosialis registered\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis name as a volunteer? This is a  motion\r\n\r\nwhich  only tries to confuse two issues. First,  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia issue, and second, West Irian. From this it\r\n\r\nis  clear  that  the motion brought forward  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis is clearly dishonest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter mentioned is that the Government\r\n\r\nhas taken steps in regard to posters. If the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is  really sincere in holding  rallies  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of the Republic of Indonesia in its demand,\r\n\r\nwhy then should those who stick posters work late at\r\n\r\nnight?  Have  they no other time to  stick  posters?\r\n\r\nEven if the Barisan Sosialis can work about 16 hours\r\n\r\none day, it does not reach up to 2 a.m. If they work\r\n\r\n16  hours or 2 hours a day, why must it take them up\r\n\r\nto 2 a.m. to stick up posters? Is this an honest and\r\n\r\nsincere way of doing things? So it is clear that the\r\n\r\nquestion  brought  up in this Assembly  is  only  an\r\n\r\nattempt to confuse the two issues. As I have clearly\r\n\r\nstated, the Barisan symbol itself is confusing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the debate on the Commission of Inquiry\r\n\r\ninto the educational policy -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

They are not going to get\r\n\r\nmore  guns, nor are they going to get more manpower.\r\n\r\nThey have this in abundance. In fact, this motion is\r\n\r\nmore  of  an embarrassment to the Indonesian  people\r\n\r\nand  the  Indonesian Government.  For  once  in  the\r\n\r\nhistory  of  the  struggle for party  domination  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   the  Government  and  the   people   of\r\n\r\nIndonesia are going to be led deliberately into  the\r\n\r\nquagmire of local politics, as indeed they have been\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Consul-General  of  Indonesia  wisely  or\r\n\r\nunwisely  instructed a representative of his  to  be\r\n\r\npresent at the mass meeting held in Geylang Serai by\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know with what motive the mass meeting\r\n\r\nwas  held,  and  why it was held in a  predominantly\r\n\r\nMalay   constituency.

But,  as  it\r\n\r\nturned  out, no such thing happened.

But now with half  the\r\n\r\nfield  occupied  by permanent stalls  and  itinerant\r\n\r\nhawkers,  a  car park, four to five thousand  people\r\n\r\nwere, in my opinion, a fair estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the point I am making is that those who\r\n\r\nwent  to the meeting did not come from the vicinity.\r\n\r\nThey  came from various parts of the island in lorry\r\n\r\nloads, no doubt organised by the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> There were some buses. Sir, that\r\n\r\nwas the best the Barisan could produce, and I do not\r\n\r\nthink I need say anything more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to the motion, I have no doubt that\r\n\r\nthe  general sentiments of this House will  see  the\r\n\r\nmotion through, even though we are not blind to  the\r\n\r\nintent   behind  it.  I,  Sir,  have  followed   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian struggle for independence from  the  very\r\n\r\nbeginning,  and  I can proudly say that  in  my  own\r\n\r\nsmall way I have contributed my share, not by making\r\n\r\nspeeches,  but  by getting myself  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nstruggle. When many Members in this House, including\r\n\r\nthe Member for Thomson, were still in school in 1946\r\n\r\nand  1947, I was smuggling guns for the Indonesians.\r\n\r\nI  was  smuggling  guns  into  Pekan  Bahru - not  for\r\n\r\nprofit, Sir, but because of my firm conviction  that\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian fight against the Dutch colonialists\r\n\r\nwas my fight too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today what do we have? We have a motion in\r\n\r\nthe name of the Barisan Sosialis calling upon us  to\r\n\r\ntake  cognizance  of  the  heroic  struggle  of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  people,  to express full  sympathy  with\r\n\r\ntheir  hopes and aspirations, and to call  upon  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  to  give  their  fullhearted\r\n\r\nsupport. Sir, what does this amount to? Simply this.\r\n\r\nIt means that no one is going to shed any blood over\r\n\r\nWest Irian. Let us pay a bit of lip\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice and embarrass all political opponents!  That\r\n\r\nis  the  theme of this motion. Those of us who  have\r\n\r\nfollowed  the  recent political trends in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  understand what I mean. Indeed, Sir,  politics\r\n\r\nin  Singapore can be very dirty. There  is  a  Malay\r\n\r\nsaying which goes: \"Kuman di-seberang lautan nampak;\r\n\r\ngajah di-bibir mata ta' kelihatan\", which means,  in\r\n\r\nEnglish,  germs that cross the sea are visible,  but\r\n\r\ninvisible  to  you  with the elephants  before  your\r\n\r\neyes.  That  sums  up the attitude  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. They can see colonialism at work in  Irian\r\n\r\nBarat  but  colonialism in Singapore and the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories does not exist to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in this august Assembly, we spent weeks debating the eradication of colonialism in our part of the world.

Asia and Africa, including\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia, have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  past century been dominated by the Western\r\n\r\nimperial  powers.  The  Western  powers  have   made\r\n\r\ninroads into these large tracts of land, firstly, in\r\n\r\nthe   form   of  commerce  and  trade,  subsequently\r\n\r\nfollowed   by  preaching  missionaries,   and   then\r\n\r\nultimately followed by the gunboat. The time is past\r\n\r\nwhen  a  gunboat alone can subdue the  nationalistic\r\n\r\nspirit of the people in Asia and Africa. Once upon a\r\n\r\ntime Africa was represented to us as the white man's\r\n\r\ngrave.  Indeed, Africa was the white  man's  burden.\r\n\r\nBut today we find that the whole of Africa has found\r\n\r\nthat  it  is the white man who is a burden upon  the\r\n\r\nAfricans.  It is because of this that we  find  that\r\n\r\nAfrica  has  been  torn today  into  several  States\r\n\r\nfighting against colonialism. The House will  recall\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  last Session, I had  the  honour  and\r\n\r\nprivilege  to move a motion supporting the  struggle\r\n\r\nof  the  Algerian people against French colonialism.\r\n\r\nThe  House will still recall how we received the pro\r\n\r\ntem Prime Minister of the provisional Government  of\r\n\r\nAlgeria,  and  that we in this House at  that  time,\r\n\r\ntogether   with  the  people  of  Singapore,   fully\r\n\r\nsupported the cause of the Algerian struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have a similar motion with similar\r\n\r\nsentiments,  that  this  House  should  endorse  its\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  confidence  of  the  Afro-Asian\r\n\r\npeople to fight external domination. It is true that\r\n\r\ntoday  we  see  in Africa a bitter struggle  against\r\n\r\ncolonialism in which violence has been employed.  It\r\n\r\nis  true  that  Goa has been retaken by  the  Indian\r\n\r\nGovernment by the use of force. But, Sir,  while  we\r\n\r\nare  in full support of all colonial peonies against\r\n\r\ntheir masters, at the same time, we cannot but  feel\r\n\r\nsorry  that this anti-colonial struggle  has  to  be\r\n\r\nconducted  by  violence. Now, it is not  because  we\r\n\r\nfear  bloodshed ourselves. It is not because we fear\r\n\r\nthat  peace and tranquillity will be disturbed  that\r\n\r\nwe  regret indeed that force should ever be used  at\r\n\r\nany  time  to solve political problems. It  must  be\r\n\r\nquite  clear  to  us, as we have  mentioned  in  our\r\n\r\nstatement to the Press last month, that any  violent\r\n\r\nstruggle  in  any part of the world is bound,  under\r\n\r\nmodern  conditions,  to draw in  the  major  powers.\r\n\r\nWhilst we fully sympathise with the Indonesian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment in their aspirations to  recover\r\n\r\ntheir  sovereignty in West Irian, a sympathy  which,\r\n\r\nin  fact the Prime Minister has expressed during his\r\n\r\nstate visit to Jakarta, we must at the same time try\r\n\r\nto   look  at  the  problem  objectively  and   with\r\n\r\nfarsightedness. If it should come to pass that  over\r\n\r\nthe  issue of West Irian, a violent struggle erupts,\r\n\r\nit  is  not  impossible that other powers  would  be\r\n\r\ndrawn into the struggle. Members have been aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  statements which have been issued in the  Press\r\n\r\nby the Prime Minister of Australia and by the leader\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition in the Australian Parliament  of\r\n\r\ntheir   own   fears   of  the  consequences   of   a\r\n\r\nconflagration  in West Irian.

The fire could have started from  a  few\r\n\r\nsparks in a solitary attap house. But when the  fire\r\n\r\nbroke out in that little attap house, the people who\r\n\r\nwere  living in the neighbourhood did not, or  could\r\n\r\nnot  control or isolate that little fire. The result\r\n\r\nwas  that  what would have been only a  little  fire\r\n\r\nvery  rapidly became a conflagration until it became\r\n\r\na  disaster for a very large part of Singapore.  Try\r\n\r\nto  project the course of events that may happen  if\r\n\r\nin  any  part  of  this world we have  also  such  a\r\n\r\npolitical fire. Members of this House who  claim  to\r\n\r\nbe  well read surely should be aware that one of the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  which  the  modern  world   faces   is\r\n\r\ncontainment  of  political fires. We  have  seen  it\r\n\r\nhappen  in Laos, we have seen it happen in  Vietnam,\r\n\r\nwe  have  seen it happening in Africa, and  all  the\r\n\r\nwhile it is the task of all those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  subscribe  to the ideals of the United  Nations\r\n\r\nCharter to try and contain these little fires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not pretend to be a fierce speaker;\r\n\r\nneither  do I pretend that I can agitate anybody  to\r\n\r\ngo  into a fight. The last thing I will do is to try\r\n\r\nand  make  fierce speeches or speak very loudly  and\r\n\r\npush  other  people to the front  line  without  due\r\n\r\nconsideration of consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sufficiently old when the war broke out in\r\n\r\nMalaya  in 1941 to understand, to know and  to  feel\r\n\r\nwhat  war  is. I would never want that we  who  have\r\n\r\nlived  through one war should, by our own stupidity,\r\n\r\nget  involved  into another war, or implicate  those\r\n\r\nwho  are innocent in the sufferings of another  war.\r\n\r\nMy  allusion  to the Bukit Ho Swee fire as  starting\r\n\r\nfrom  a  little spark which reached the roof  of  an\r\n\r\nattap  house  can  be  applied very  easily  to  the\r\n\r\nsituation in South-East Asia. As I have said at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning,  we  are in sympathy with all  those  who\r\n\r\nfight  against  colonialism.  The  question  of  New\r\n\r\nGuinea  or  Irian  Barat has  been  a  long-standing\r\n\r\nquestion, but until lately, no real fighting has yet\r\n\r\nbroken out between Indonesia and Holland over  Irian\r\n\r\nBarat. As long as there are possibilities that  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the  control of the Administration  of\r\n\r\nIrian  Barat can be discussed objectively in a  calm\r\n\r\natmosphere  to  which the United Nations  subscribe,\r\n\r\nthen  I  say  we  ought to encourage both  sides  to\r\n\r\nproceed  along these lines. There is indeed  genuine\r\n\r\ntension which is developing in South-East Asia  over\r\n\r\nIrian  Barat. It is happening not only in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThere   is   not  only  excitement  in  Malaya   and\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but also in the continent of  Australia.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Straits Times of 1st January, there  was  a\r\n\r\nReuter report saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Australian Prime Minister, Mr Robert Menzies,\r\n\r\nwarned   Indonesia  yesterday  that  any  Indonesian\r\n\r\nattack  on  Dutch  New  Guinea  could  turn  into  a\r\n\r\nconflict  between the white and coloured peoples  in\r\n\r\nthis part of the world.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>To  which the President of the Republic of Indonesia\r\n\r\nhas  replied, if I may quote the Free Press  of  3rd\r\n\r\nJanuary:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any nation lays charges against us it must be\r\n\r\nacting on the Dutch plan to set up a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npuppet Papuan state.

A Reuter report carried by the\r\n\r\nStraits Times of 5th January said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The wartime-commander of Australia's 8th Division\r\n\r\nin Malaya, Lieut.-General Gordon Bennett, said today\r\n\r\na  national  service training scheme should  be  re-introduced immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that Australia \"would not last 10 minutes\"\r\n\r\nif attacked from the North by an Asian power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>* * *</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We are in no danger from Indonesia at the moment,\r\n\r\nbut  when  she gets a little more uppish  she  could\r\n\r\nflirt with Russia.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>To follow up the line of excitement that is going on\r\n\r\nin South-East Asia, another Reuter report carried by\r\n\r\nthe Straits Times of 12th January, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A survey taken in the light of the developing West\r\n\r\nNew  Guinea  crisis showed that Australia  had  more\r\n\r\nthan  83,000  men virtually on call for  service  if\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canberra correspondent of the Melbourne Herald\r\n\r\nsaid  yesterday  that  of these  about  47,000  were\r\n\r\nregular  army, navy or air force personnel  on  full\r\n\r\ntime service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>* * *</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 200,000 men have completed basic national\r\n\r\nservice training, mainly in the army.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this rattling of the sabre rather alarms\r\n\r\nme,  because the question of West Irian is no longer\r\n\r\nan  isolated  problem.

Surely  the\r\n\r\nDutch  have  been reasonable. Why do you  lend  your\r\n\r\nsupport  to the specious propaganda agitation?\"  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  have had some experience  in  answering\r\n\r\nthis  type of question. I think it might be  helpful\r\n\r\nto  this  Assembly if we do consider dispassionately\r\n\r\nthe  `basic  issues  so  as to  understand  our  own\r\n\r\nfeelings which are so deeply sympathetic towards the\r\n\r\npeople of Irian Barat and Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister speaks truly when he says there is a great deal of ignorance on the basic issues. But there is a curious phenomenon in ths. In most human conduct, many human beings seem to achieve the right approach without ever being able to tell you of the logical means or even of an understanding of the issues which could help to a\r\n\r\nlogical  solution of the issues. I do say  that  our\r\n\r\npeople have reached the right result, although I  am\r\n\r\nbound  to  admit that due to an inadequate Press  we\r\n\r\nare  gravely  inadequately  informed  on  the  basic\r\n\r\nissues, and I would ask the indulgence of this House\r\n\r\nif  I  seek to go back a little to the things which\r\n\r\nmotivate  our feelings and the facts - some  of  which\r\n\r\nare  quite  favourable  to  the  Dutch - which  should\r\n\r\naffect our judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Asia had for two centuries been politically,\r\n\r\neconomically,  and  militarily  enslaved  by   white\r\n\r\ndomination. For these two centuries, the  people  of\r\n\r\nAsia had been prostrate, wallowing in the tragedy of\r\n\r\nhelplessness, whilst others robbed us of our wealth,\r\n\r\nour  energy and even of our manhood. Then  a  little\r\n\r\nmore   than  half  a  century  ago,  the  liberation\r\n\r\nmovement  found sparks in India, and that spread  to\r\n\r\nChina,  to  Indonesia and elsewhere, and the  little\r\n\r\nrivulet  of  more than half a century  ago  grew  in\r\n\r\nstrength and became a surge so strong against while\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndomination  that  the  British  were  compelled   to\r\n\r\nwithdraw from vast areas. And with their traditional\r\n\r\nwisdom, they withdrew gracefully. The Dutch withdrew\r\n\r\nfrom  considerable areas of what  is  now  known  as\r\n\r\nIndonesia under military and political pressure. The\r\n\r\nPortuguese have been kicked out. The French lost  on\r\n\r\nthe battlefield. This surge against white domination\r\n\r\nhas  become of the very marrow of our bones.  It  is\r\n\r\npart  of us. All Asia today consciously resents  any\r\n\r\nwhite domination anywhere in this continent. I would\r\n\r\nlike it to be clearly understood and recognised that\r\n\r\nthis is not an anti-white movement. We are happy  to\r\n\r\nwelcome the white men as any other human beings,  as\r\n\r\ncolleagues   and  partners.  It  is  an   anti-white\r\n\r\ndomination  movement.  It  is  a  movement   against\r\n\r\nforeign  domination of our people. Let us  recognise\r\n\r\nthat   even  today  there  are  pockets   of   white\r\n\r\ndomination   and   white   imperialism   in    Asian\r\n\r\nterritories,  and it is this which  the  decent  and\r\n\r\npeace-loving  people of Singapore  resent  from  the\r\n\r\ndepths  of  their  being. It is  this  that  is  the\r\n\r\nexplanation  of  the emotional speeches  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  and are being made and will probably  be\r\n\r\nmade. The Deputy Prime Minister deplores -  and I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  his point of view  - slogans  which  could\r\n\r\ninflame  feelings to the point of sparking violence.\r\n\r\nBut let us recognise that to the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nIrian Barat is an island in Asia and its people  are\r\n\r\nAsians. Irian Barat is under the control of a  white\r\n\r\npeople  and  under the domination of a  white  race.\r\n\r\nThat  is enough. This is the first and main fact  of\r\n\r\nlife  that Western observers must recognise and must\r\n\r\nunderstand, that Asia will not tolerate -  and I  mean\r\n\r\nall Asian nations  -  that any Asian territory be longer\r\n\r\ndominated by a European power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second fact of life which has been little\r\n\r\nunderstood  even in the United Nations - and  frankly,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, in all otherwise admirable speech\r\n\r\nby the Deputy Prime Minister, even little understood\r\n\r\nby   the   Deputy  Prime  Minster  himself - are   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  in  which it  is  legitimate  to  use\r\n\r\nforce. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI   say   to   you - and  it  is  not  for  propaganda\r\n\r\npurposes - that I sincerely believe that the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  and  I  are  as genuinely  dedicated  to  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of peace amongst nations and international\r\n\r\ngoodwill as any other group of human beings. Perhaps\r\n\r\nit  is in our own interest. We recognise that we are\r\n\r\na  small  people and we could not survive except  in\r\n\r\npeace. But I believe that we go further than that. I\r\n\r\nsay,  Sir,  that  Mr  Adlai Stevenson,  the  United\r\n\r\nStates   representative  in  the   United   Nations,\r\n\r\nerred - and erred grievously - when he laid down in  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  Goa that force can only be  legitimately\r\n\r\nused  to  meet immediate aggression. We  accept  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  self-defence, but we say  it  is  not\r\n\r\nexclusive. We would add that in the case of colonies\r\n\r\nthere  are two other sets of circumstances in  which\r\n\r\nforce  is legitimate. The first is nationally, where\r\n\r\na  people seeks to free itself from imperialist  and\r\n\r\nforeign  domination  within its  territory,  as  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian struggle for its own independence against\r\n\r\nthe  Dutch.  The  second  set  of  circumstances  is\r\n\r\ninternationally, where a nation seeks to  free  part\r\n\r\nof   its  territory  and  its  people  from  foreign\r\n\r\nimperial domination, such as the action of India  in\r\n\r\nGoa. The only proviso - and a vital proviso - that we of\r\n\r\nthe  Workers' Party recognise in these two  sets  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances  is  that every  reasonable  means  of\r\n\r\npeaceful   settlement   should   first   have   been\r\n\r\nattempted -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Members\r\n\r\nare  aware that when this issue was debated  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited   Nations  a  short  while  ago,  Mr   Adlai\r\n\r\nStevenson sought to censure India for aggression  in\r\n\r\nliberating Goa by force, although he was aware  that\r\n\r\nGoa  was  geographically and  historically  part  of\r\n\r\nIndian  territory.  Mr  Speaker,  let  it  not   be\r\n\r\nmisunderstood: I am not anti-American and I have the\r\n\r\ndeepest  respect  for the intellectual  stature  and\r\n\r\nexquisite phraseology of that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is with regret that I noticed his incapacity  to\r\n\r\nrecognise the legitimate right of a nation  to  free\r\n\r\npart   of  its  territory  from  continued  imperial\r\n\r\nrule - an incapacity, if I might suggest, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\ndue to partial amnesia in respect of the h story  of\r\n\r\nhis own nation. Mr Adlai Stevenson forgot that some\r\n\r\ntwo centuries ago in that part of the world where we\r\n\r\nnow  have  the  United  States there  were  American\r\n\r\ncolonies, and that these American colonies  rebelled\r\n\r\nagainst  British imperial rule, and the  big-hearted\r\n\r\nFrench  came to their support militarily with  naval\r\n\r\nand  armed  forces  to  assist these  very  American\r\n\r\ncolonies  in  throwing off the British yoke  and  to\r\n\r\nassist  them  in  gaining  their  independence.  Was\r\n\r\nFrance  guilty  of  aggression in giving  her  armed\r\n\r\nassistance  to these colonies? Was LaFayette  to  be\r\n\r\ncondemned? Is Mr Adlai Stevenson prepared to  state\r\n\r\non  the next 4.h of July that he condemns the French\r\n\r\nfor having assisted militarily the American colonies\r\n\r\nin gaining their freedom - that he condemns: LaFayette\r\n\r\nfor  his magnificent contribution to the achievement\r\n\r\nof  American independence? If not, let him recognise\r\n\r\nthat  in  his  ignorance of his own history  he  has\r\n\r\nwrongly condemned India and her great Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof aggression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our Deputy Prime Minister says he learned of India's action with regret. No human\r\n\r\nbeing can view other than with regret any resort  to \r\n\r\ninternational force: and in that I ant with him. But\r\n\r\nif  he  implied there a censure of India's  conduct,\r\n\r\nthen  I  would ask of him, is he not aware that  for\r\n\r\nmore  than  ten  years India has  striven  in  every\r\n\r\npossible  way, by every possible peaceful means,  to\r\n\r\nachieve  a  solution  to end the  imperial  rule  of\r\n\r\nPortugal in part of her territory? Could India  have\r\n\r\ndone  anything more in the line of peaceful  effort?\r\n\r\nIf  she  could,  then, Mr Speaker, I  am  with  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister in condemning India.

Therefore, in trying to achieve the  prob\r\n\r\nlem  of  Goa by force, it was like using  a  sledge-hammer to crack a little nut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, autre temps, autre\r\n\r\nmoeurs   - in  different  circumstances,  a  different\r\n\r\neffort.  I  think  the  Deputy Prime  Minister  will\r\n\r\nrecognize  as  much as I do, and  I  recognize  this\r\n\r\nwithout  seeking to be patronising, that the British\r\n\r\nover  the  centuries  of their  colonial  rule  have\r\n\r\nshown,  apart  from their selfishness, a  remarkable\r\n\r\nbreadth of common sense. There was balance in  their\r\n\r\napproach. They never pushed their luck too far,  nor\r\n\r\na  logical argument too far: \"This is my property. I\r\n\r\nhave  a legal right to it. I am going to retain it.\"\r\n\r\nThey  showed good sense. With people like that,  you\r\n\r\ncan - how  shall I say it?  - struggle constitutionally.\r\n\r\nThat is why the problem posed by the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\n\"Are  we  here  to recommend then a violent  end  to\r\n\r\ncolonialism?\" is academic. The answer is \"Yes, it is\r\n\r\nacademic  because it will not happen.\"  The  British\r\n\r\nwould   be  willing  to  hand  us  our  independence\r\n\r\nwhenever, I say, we are near being strong enough  to\r\n\r\ntake over. That is the whole point. With the British\r\n\r\nyou  could  use satyagraha. But with the  Portuguese\r\n\r\nand  their  intransigeant  arrogance,  I  say,  with\r\n\r\nrespect,  that  I  believe they  would  qualify  for\r\n\r\nP.A.P. membership; and with them, what would you do?\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, the position is reached that over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  in  every  field in and out  of  the  United\r\n\r\nNations,  India  did  what she  could.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  limit  even to the utmost  humble  human\r\n\r\npatience.  They were her people, this was her  land,\r\n\r\nand  the  damage was done. It is true, I  regret  it\r\n\r\ntoo.  But  let  us  face  it: she  was  legitimately\r\n\r\nentitled to do what she ultimately did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is material to our own argument, because\r\n\r\nit  is  in this context that we must see Indonesia's\r\n\r\nefforts  to  achieve the liberation of Irian  Barat.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, what is Irian Barat? It is a part of  a\r\n\r\nvast island. In itself, Irian Barat,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  is the subject matter in dispute, is a  piece\r\n\r\nof  land of several islands which total in area some\r\n\r\n700  times the area of Singapore. The population  is\r\n\r\nless than half the population of Singapore, and  the\r\n\r\npeople  are primitive to a considerable degree.  The\r\n\r\nDutch first established their administration in that\r\n\r\narea  for  trading purposes, I think some  63  years\r\n\r\nago, Mr Speaker, although in fairness they have had\r\n\r\nan  interest in that area for almost one and a  half\r\n\r\ncenturies.  But  the  very  first  time  that   they\r\n\r\nofficially established administration was, I  think,\r\n\r\nin 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the administration of Irian Barat was integrated by the Dutch with their administration over some 3,000 islands. The mainland was what was then known as Java and Sumatra, under the administration known as the Netherlands East Indies administration. After the war - and here we must admire them - almost with no arms but with the vigour\r\n\r\nand the passion and the sincerity of a proud people,\r\n\r\nthe Indonesia's put up an armed struggle against the\r\n\r\nDutch.  And  partly through that armed struggle  and\r\n\r\npartly, Sir, let us admit frankly, through political\r\n\r\npressures, they achieved their independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, their independence was achieved officially by\r\n\r\nan  agreement  known as the Charter of  Transfer  of\r\n\r\nSovereignty  executed by Holland and the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment.  If I might - it is very brief   - read  the\r\n\r\nfirst Article. Article 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the Kingdom of the Netherlands\r\n\r\nunconditionally  and irrevocably transfers  complete\r\n\r\nsovereignty  over Indonesia to the Republic  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited States of Indonesia.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  that  is  quite obviously  to  cover  all  the\r\n\r\nterritories  that were then known as the Netherlands\r\n\r\nEast  Indies.  But  in fairness, Sir,  let  us  read\r\n\r\nArticle 2 which specifically refers to Irian  Barat.\r\n\r\nArticle 2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... it is decided that the status quo of the\r\n\r\nresidency of New Guinea ...',\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  if I may pause for a moment - that  was\r\n\r\nthe  name in pre-independence days of what  we  call\r\n\r\nIrian Barat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... it is decided that the status quo of the\r\n\r\nresidency of New Guinea shall be maintained with the\r\n\r\nstipulation  that  within a yea  from  the  date  of\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  sovereignty to  the  Republic  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  of  Indonesia the  question  of  the\r\n\r\npolitical status of New Guinea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis to be determined through negotiations between the\r\n\r\nRepublic of the United States of Indonesia  and  the\r\n\r\nKingdom of the Netherlands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Indonesians claim that by virtue of this\r\n\r\nagreement, they are lawfully entitled to  that  area\r\n\r\nthen  known  as  New Guinea and not known  as  Irian\r\n\r\nBarat; or, alternatively, that no question affecting\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution of Irian Barat could be considered\r\n\r\nwithout their concurrence. They say, \"We have tried,\r\n\r\nand  tried with patience, to deliberate with you for\r\n\r\ntwo  or  three years on the subject of the transfer,\r\n\r\nnot  only for one year, which is provided in Article\r\n\r\n2,  and  all  you  do is dig your toes  in.\"  It  is\r\n\r\ncorrect  that  at  that period the Dutch  vigorously\r\n\r\nmaintained  their  imperial  approach,  and  in  the\r\n\r\nfrustrating   circumstances   then   ensuing,    the\r\n\r\nIndonesians broke off diplomatic relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in fairness to the Dutch, let me add this.\r\n\r\nThey stated that by virtue of an exchange of letters\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Indonesian Government  and  the  Dutch\r\n\r\nGovernment arising Out of the Charter of Transfer of\r\n\r\nSovereignty, Article 2, the Indonesians agreed  that\r\n\r\nIrian Barat should remain under the Dutch Government\r\n\r\nuntil the Dutch agreed to its transfer. In fact, the\r\n\r\nDutch said the Indonesians never really wanted Irian\r\n\r\nBarat  until after the execution of the  Charter  of\r\n\r\nTransfer of Sovereignty. And, Mr Speaker, they made\r\n\r\ncapital of the fact that Dr Hatta (I think in  July\r\n\r\n1945)  stated  during the conference  of  Indonesian\r\n\r\nleaders    leading    to   the    proclamation    of\r\n\r\nindependence - these  are the  words  Dr  Hatta,  who\r\n\r\nlater became Vice-President of Indonesia, is alleged\r\n\r\nto have said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the territory of Papua ...',\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>again,  Mr  Speaker, Papua is the  pre-independence\r\n\r\nname of Irian Barat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the territory of Papua could be exchanged for\r\n\r\nNorth  Borneo, I would be rather grateful Personally\r\n\r\nI  am quite willing to state that I do not bother at\r\n\r\nall about Papua.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  the Vice-President saying that. Yes.  But,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  curiously  I  managed  to  unearth  a\r\n\r\ndocument  where  I  have  the  historic  speech   of\r\n\r\nPresident  Soekarno  during the proceedings  in  the\r\n\r\nInvestigation Committee in preparation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Independence  when he enunciated  the  historic\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  Panchsheela. Sir,  the  document  is\r\n\r\nknown   as  The  Birth  of  Panchsheela,  the   five\r\n\r\nprinciples   of  the  Indonesian  State.   President\r\n\r\nSoekarno's speech - the quotation is this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Indonesian leaders should aim at the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of one national State  based  on  the\r\n\r\nentity  of  one  Indonesia from the tip  of  Sumatra\r\n\r\nright up to Papua.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  again  in fairness,  the  Dutch  say,\r\n\r\n\"Well, you claim you are entitled to Irian Barat and\r\n\r\nthat it is lawfully your possession. We are prepared\r\n\r\nto  go  to  the  International Court of  Justice  to\r\n\r\nsubmit this claim to arbitration.\" Mr Speaker, that\r\n\r\nimpresses me. I say to you frankly, if a man says to\r\n\r\nme,  \"I  am  prepared to go to  court  to  prove  my\r\n\r\nclaim,\"  then  that satisfies me that  he  genuinely\r\n\r\nbelieves he is right. And I accept the fact that the\r\n\r\nDutch   genuinely  believe  that  they  are  legally\r\n\r\nentitled to possession of Irian Bar it. Whether such\r\n\r\nbelief  is  right or wrong, let us leave that  aside\r\n\r\nfor the moment, sir, because the issue never went to\r\n\r\nthe International Court of Justice. But how far does\r\n\r\nthat  take  them? Let us assume that  they  are,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   just  for  the  sake  of  argument,  legally\r\n\r\nentitled to the territory of Irian Barat. Where does\r\n\r\nit  take them? The British were legally entitled  to -\r\n\r\nPenang and to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> Singapore!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And to Singapore, it is true. We\r\n\r\nwill  leave  Singapore out. Everybody has  forgotten\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Thank  you.  I  beg  your  pardon.   Mr\r\n\r\nSneaker,  I  thank  the Deputy  Prime  Minister  for\r\n\r\nreminding  me  that  they are  legally  entitled  to\r\n\r\nMalacca  and many other possessions. But  they  have\r\n\r\nthe  good sense to realise that - how shall I say  it,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker? - laws are made for the  convenience  of\r\n\r\nhuman  beings  and  not for their constriction,  and\r\n\r\nthat  legal rights cannot stand in the way of  human\r\n\r\nneeds. The British recognise that and we expect  the\r\n\r\nDutch  to  have the good sense to recognise  it.  So\r\n\r\nwhether they are legally entitled to Irian Barat  or\r\n\r\nnot, let us leave aside the issue of law which is in\r\n\r\nthe context of human needs an irrelevancy. And again\r\n\r\nlet us recognise this. The Dutch do, not in so many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwords  but by their actions, admit that the position\r\n\r\nof  hanging on to Irian Barat because of some  legal\r\n\r\njustification  is untenable. It is somewhat  a  late\r\n\r\nchange  in  their policy, but in fairness  to  them,\r\n\r\nthey  do now recognise it, because, fortunately only\r\n\r\ntwo  months  ago  in the United Nations,  the  Dutch\r\n\r\noffered publicly to have a United Nations Commission\r\n\r\nadminister  Irian Barat until such time  as  it  was\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that the population of Irian Barat  could\r\n\r\nhave  a  plebiscite to be held under United  Nations\r\n\r\nsupervision to decide what the people of Irian Barat\r\n\r\nwish for their constitutional future. I believe  the\r\n\r\nDutch added that if the people of Irian Barat wanted\r\n\r\nto  join  Indonesia they would gladly  concur.  They\r\n\r\nwould raise no objection. Belated though it is,  let\r\n\r\nus  at least give appreciation of a brave act and  a\r\n\r\nradical change on the part of the Dutch, an act  and\r\n\r\na  change which recognise that White imperialism  in\r\n\r\nAsia  is  no  longer appropriate,  and  furthermore,\r\n\r\nofficial   recognition  of  the   right   of   self-determination of the people in these colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this was a radical departure from the imperial approach to the problem through their negotiations with Indonesia in the early years of Indonesia's independence. Sir, unfortunately for many years now, there have been no diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Holland, and the two\r\n\r\nhave not been on talking terms. But let us ourselves\r\n\r\nlook  at this offer, magnanimous as it seems on  the\r\n\r\npart  of the Dutch, in the United Nations two months\r\n\r\nago.  What  is  the sum total of this offer?  To  my\r\n\r\nmind,  it  constitutes a retreat, and  a  courageous\r\n\r\nretreat,  from  their imperialist  approach  and  an\r\n\r\neffort  to  concede  the claim of Indonesia  without\r\n\r\ndoing so publicly, providing - how shall I say it, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker? - a  face-saving  machinery.  Now,  the   end\r\n\r\nresult  of the United Nations Commission plebiscite,\r\n\r\nwould  be  reunion with Indonesia through a somewhat\r\n\r\ncircuitous and tortuous route.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the Workers' Party have a great deal of\r\n\r\nrespect  for  the value, in human relations  of  the\r\n\r\nface-saving principle. We accept and admit  that  if\r\n\r\nan opponent recognises his mistake and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  prepared  to  change his  stand,  we  should  be\r\n\r\ngenerous and help him to save his face, for it  does\r\n\r\nno one good to take away a man's self-respect unless\r\n\r\nit is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is the Indonesian answer to this\r\n\r\nseemingly generous gesture on the part of the Dutch?\r\n\r\nThey  look right through the face-saving device  and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"But look, you are being obstructive. You  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  achieve, after many years and through  a\r\n\r\nvery   circuitous  route,  what  in  fact  we  claim\r\n\r\nrightfully now. You are admitting it. You only  want\r\n\r\nto  delay it.\" Sir, that is true. For myself I think\r\n\r\nit  is  valid  that the procedure suggested  by  the\r\n\r\nDutch really seeks to delay, not for the purposes of\r\n\r\ndelaying, in fairness to them, but to my mind, seeks\r\n\r\nto  delay for the purposes of political face-saving.\r\n\r\nAnd  the Indonesians say, \"We have been patient long\r\n\r\nenough.  We  are  not prepared  to  enter  into  any\r\n\r\ndiscussions with you on the subject, except on  your\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  the principle that  the  discussion\r\n\r\nwill   be   for   the  purposes   of   transfer   of\r\n\r\nsovereignty.\" I do not know whether I  have  carried\r\n\r\nyou  so  far, Mr Speaker, as to recognise  that  we\r\n\r\nhave reached the point where the differences between\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and  the  Dutch have  been  reduced  very\r\n\r\nconsiderably,  to the point where they  have  almost\r\n\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the earnest hope of the Workers' Party that\r\n\r\nthe Dutch, who have shown both wisdom and courage in\r\n\r\ntheir   proposal,  however  belated  in  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  two  months ago, should now  recognise  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  one  final gesture. Sir, the  Dutch  must\r\n\r\nrecognise that the whole of Asia would appreciate  a\r\n\r\nfrank  admission that they have, in fact, reached  a\r\n\r\npoint   where   they   agree  that   the   political\r\n\r\nsovereignty   over   Irian   Barat   is   Indonesian\r\n\r\nterritory, and that the Indonesians have  been  very\r\n\r\npatient in seeking the return of their own. You see,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  have a great deal of respect for the Dutch.\r\n\r\nThey  are a very practical people. Mr Speaker, most\r\n\r\npeople  said of the Dutch after they lost Indonesia:\r\n\r\n\"Pooh! They will be worth nothing now. They will  go\r\n\r\nback   to   being   a   penurious,  poverty-stricken\r\n\r\ncountry.\"  But  what  is  the  truth?

I know that we\r\n\r\nmust have a little buffoonery now and then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I was saying that we do respect the Dutch as a practical people, and we believe that they will recognise, we are satisfied that they will recognise, that they will earn considerable goodwill in Asia and in Indonesia if they make this final gesture. We know they are a peaceful people. They have to be a peaceful people because they are a\r\n\r\nsmall  nation  and they have shown  their  practical\r\n\r\ngood  sense  in many ways since the war.  Friendship\r\n\r\nwith Indonesia would mean a great deal to the people\r\n\r\nof   Holland.  We  cannot  believe  that  they  will\r\n\r\nsacrifice the goodwill of Indonesia and of all  Asia\r\n\r\nin order to persist in what has become a barren face-saving approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesians, who are a proud and sensitive\r\n\r\npeople,  believe  that  they  have  exhausted  every\r\n\r\npeaceful  means of solving the issue of the transfer\r\n\r\nof Irian Barat. Mr Speaker, Sir, is this remnant of\r\n\r\nDutch  pride to spark a war to their cost and  ours?\r\n\r\nDespite the Deputy Prime Minister's levity and  much\r\n\r\nthat I disagree with him in what he does, I do agree\r\n\r\nwith  him  that  that  spark  could  bring  about  a\r\n\r\nconflagration which would certainly engulf  us.  Let\r\n\r\nus recognise that if a war were to break out between\r\n\r\nIndonesia and Holland, would Russia not come in just\r\n\r\nto  prove how anti-colonial she is where non-Russian\r\n\r\ncolonies are involved?

Wherever they may have their\r\n\r\nHeadquarters,  in Bangkok or in Timbuctoo,  this  is\r\n\r\nS.E.A.T.O.,  our  base. Who is  S.E.A.T.O. but  the\r\n\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, can the Dutch in all conscience contemplate\r\n\r\npermitting  themselves to be  made  the  excuse  for\r\n\r\ntriggering off the outbreak of a major war in South-East Asia between the major powers? Do they believe,\r\n\r\nin  fact, Sir, that if it is triggered off, if there\r\n\r\nis  a criminal conspiracy to which they are parties,\r\n\r\nthat  they can confine such a war to this  area,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can play their war games with our  blood\r\n\r\nand our assets? Are they really such fools that they\r\n\r\ndo not recognise that such a war would involve their\r\n\r\nown  lovely  cities  and neat farms?  They  are  not\r\n\r\nfools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, I say this. The difference that is now\r\n\r\nleft between the Dutch and the Indonesians is not  a\r\n\r\ndifference for which any people can legitimately  go\r\n\r\nto  war.  I  think it is time that the Dutch  should\r\n\r\nrecognise  that if they are prepared  to  hand  over\r\n\r\nIrian  Barat to the United Nations Commission,  then\r\n\r\nwhy  not  to Indonesia?

Therefore, let us have  some  respect  for\r\n\r\naccredited representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, with respect, I could\r\n\r\nnot  have  more respect for the noble Earl  and  the\r\n\r\nremarkable talent he wears so gracefully; nor can  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  how  my  remarks could  be  in  any  way\r\n\r\nindicative   of  being  derogatory   of   the   hon.\r\n\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nknows  what  the  Chair is against.  One  might  use\r\n\r\nflowery  language in praise of a person which  would\r\n\r\nhe acceptable, but the same flowery language used in\r\n\r\na different tone of voice might not he acceptable. I\r\n\r\nthink  the  thing  to do is just  to  refer  to  the\r\n\r\ngentleman as the United Kingdom Commissioner and  he\r\n\r\ndone with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  was  going  to say, and I trust it is acceptable,\r\n\r\nthat  it  is not for me to seek to advise the  noble\r\n\r\nEarl.  He has his retinue of advisers, and  his  own\r\n\r\npersonal knowledge and abilities whereby he must  be\r\n\r\nadequately  informed of our basic  feelings.  But  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  emphasise in this Chamber: do not use  the\r\n\r\nSingapore base against Indonesia. We are a  peaceful\r\n\r\npeople and a gentle people, Mr Speaker. There is  a\r\n\r\nChinese proverb you push the tiger to the wall,  and\r\n\r\nhe  will turn. Maybe we are not tigers. We have  not\r\n\r\ngot  the leadership. But it is not inappropriate  to\r\n\r\nremember  a  name  which I  hope  will  one  day  be\r\n\r\nprophetic,  i.e. the name of Singapore  which  means\r\n\r\nthe  House of Lions. Whether we are lions or not,  I\r\n\r\ndo  repeat:  do not use the Singapore  base  against\r\n\r\nIndonesia, for if such were to happen, then we might\r\n\r\nwell  find  a  leader and there  might  well  be  no\r\n\r\nSingapore base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a pity\r\n\r\nthat the hon, gentleman who moved and supported this\r\n\r\nmotion  in the Barisan Opposition, instead of trying\r\n\r\nto seek the unanimous support of the House, tried to\r\n\r\nmake this issue an inter-party affair. For instance,\r\n\r\nwe  have a remark made by the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nin  his opening address when, in sneering tones,  he\r\n\r\nreferred to the P.A.P. He said that even the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwill support Indonesia's struggle for West Irian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I remind the Member for Queenstown that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. had supported Indonesia's claim to  West\r\n\r\nIrian  years before the Barisan Sosialis was formed?\r\n\r\nOur stand on this issue was not made just to whip up\r\n\r\npopular enthusiasm on an anti-colonial issue. It was\r\n\r\nmade very early when the Party came to office, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  that  nobody  in his senses would  question  the\r\n\r\nsincerity of our position. But this does not prevent\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Thomson from making  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\ndisparaging remarks against the P.A.P. I do not want\r\n\r\nto  waste  the time of the House in going into  each\r\n\r\nand  every one of them. Yesterday, for instance,  he\r\n\r\nsaw  fit  to refer to myself as a Fascist. Today  he\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the  Prime Minister  as  a  thug.  His\r\n\r\ngeneral  attitude is that the P.A.P. has  lost  its\r\n\r\nanti-colonial fervour; not merely that, Sir, we  are\r\n\r\nopenly in support of the Western imperialist policy.\r\n\r\nThat is quite clear  - the charge was made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no evidence at all has been produced to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  his  allegations.  We  can  meet   his\r\n\r\ncharges quite simply, not by Barisan Sosialis  anti-colonial  expressions. It is quite a  simple  matter\r\n\r\nfor  any  Party,  for anybody,  to  mount  a  public\r\n\r\nplatform and shout his head off and claim  to  be  a\r\n\r\ngreat  anti-colonial hero in a matter which concerns\r\n\r\nanother country in their fight against their  former\r\n\r\ncolonial masters. That is a simple thing to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us examine the Barisan record in respect\r\n\r\nof  their anti-colonial policy. Everybody knows that\r\n\r\nwhen  Singapore began seriously to discuss the  next\r\n\r\nstage in our constitutional development, that is, to\r\n\r\nmerge with the Federation of Malaya or form part  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, immediately the great anti-colonial heroes\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis, the six trade  unionists,\r\n\r\npublicly   proclaimed  that  the   next   stage   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's political evolution must be an  internal\r\n\r\nself-governing Singapore. They are not  prepared  to\r\n\r\nfight  colonialism  in their own country.  Just  how\r\n\r\ncontemptible can people be when they are prepared to\r\n\r\naccept   the   continuation  of  British   rule   in\r\n\r\nSingapore!  Not  merely that  - their  representatives\r\n\r\nhave gone to see none other than the highest British\r\n\r\nrepresentative  in  South-East  Asia,  the  Earl  of\r\n\r\nSelkirk  - to make a deal with him. This is now public\r\n\r\nknowledge.  The Barisan Sosialis have  never  denied\r\n\r\nthat.  They tried to explain it away by saying  that\r\n\r\nthey  just  wanted a clarification. But  every  time\r\n\r\nthey  attempted to explain away this foolish act  of\r\n\r\ntheirs,  they only let the door open to greater  and\r\n\r\nmore  damaging exposures. And so these  great  anti-colonial heroes want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsee  other  people  wage war to liberate  their  own\r\n\r\nterritories;  but  in their own  country  our  great\r\n\r\nBarisan anti-colonial heroes quietly try to  make  a\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the colonial powers and openly  proclaim\r\n\r\nthat  they  prefer  a  semi-colonial  Singapore   to\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a part of a wider, bigger, independent\r\n\r\nnation.  For such people to say that they are  anti-colonial  whereas  we are pro-colonial  is  absolute\r\n\r\nnonsense.  Only  the puerile and immature  minds  of\r\n\r\nhalf-baked  revolutionaries  would  be  deceived  by\r\n\r\ntheir propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue before the House is not whether we\r\n\r\nsupport  Indonesia  over West Irian  or  we  do  not\r\n\r\nsupport  Indonesia  over  West  Irian.  Support  and\r\n\r\nsympathy  surely will be accorded to the  Government\r\n\r\nand to the people of Indonesia by all right-thinking\r\n\r\nmen  who  understand that in the age  of  the  Asian\r\n\r\nrevolution,  the time for Western empires  is  gone;\r\n\r\nand  the  sooner, the quicker and the more  painless\r\n\r\nWestern  imperialism is wound up the better for  all\r\n\r\nconcerned. That is not the issue. The issue  is  how\r\n\r\nWest  Irian is to be returned to Indonesia, whether\r\n\r\nit  should  be  by war or whether it  should  be  by\r\n\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson went to great lengths to\r\n\r\nexplain  how narrow the differences are now  between\r\n\r\nthe  Dutch and the Indonesian Governments. I  cannot\r\n\r\nhelp feeling that he is a shade too optimistic.  But\r\n\r\nbe  that  as it may, I would agree with him that  as\r\n\r\ncompared with some months ago the prospects now  for\r\n\r\na  peaceful settlement through negotiations  between\r\n\r\nthe  two Governments are much greater than they were\r\n\r\nat any time in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, West Irian is part of a very large\r\n\r\nisland - perhaps  the  second largest  island  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  It is mostly undeveloped jungle, swamps  and\r\n\r\nmountains with a very small population. It may  have\r\n\r\ntremendous natural resources - nobody knows. The whole\r\n\r\nof  the  area  has  not been prospected,  let  alone\r\n\r\ndeveloped.  The  benefit that  the  Dutch  get  from\r\n\r\nretaining authority over West Irian is negligible. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  agree with the Member for Thomson that  the\r\n\r\nDutch  are  making  money  from  the  population  by\r\n\r\nexploiting  the  natural resources  of  West  Irian.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if the Barisan Sosialis believe  that  the\r\n\r\nDutch are making a fortune out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  West Irian, please produce facts and figures and\r\n\r\nI  am prepared to reconsider this as a statement  of\r\n\r\nfact.  The Dutch are not getting any benefit out  of\r\n\r\nit.  On  the  contrary,  they  have  to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial garrison and station fairly large  naval\r\n\r\nforces there to meet any possible Indonesian assault\r\n\r\non  West Irian. At the same time, in order to get  a\r\n\r\ngood reputation among members of the United Nations,\r\n\r\nthe  Dutch say - and I have no reason to doubt it - that\r\n\r\nthey  are  spending substantial  sums  of  money  on\r\n\r\ndeveloping the area by building schools, roads,  and\r\n\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the people of Holland surely have no desire to\r\n\r\nhang on to a colonial territory from which they  not\r\n\r\nonly get no benefit but for which they have to incur\r\n\r\na   substantial  expenditure  by  way  of   military\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and  other development  expenditure  in\r\n\r\nWest  Irian. Experts on foreign affairs  claim  that\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Dutch Cabinet are divided  on  this\r\n\r\nissue,   with  the  majority  of  Cabinet  Ministers\r\n\r\nagainst  holding  on  to  West.  Irian.  Under  such\r\n\r\nconditions and with such considerations, I think the\r\n\r\nprospects  for a peaceful settlement of  this  issue\r\n\r\nare  not unreasonable and should be explored to  the\r\n\r\nutmost before war is waged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have not tried to examine the position of\r\n\r\nWest  Irian  from the legalistic point of  view.  We\r\n\r\nhave  heard  a  long discourse from the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson, and the only conclusion one can draw is  that\r\n\r\nboth sides are right. I do not agree that both sides\r\n\r\nare right on that issue. To my mind, if one side  is\r\n\r\nright, the other must be wrong. In this case,  there\r\n\r\nis  doubt  that West Irian is part of Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nmust be returned forthwith to the Government and  to\r\n\r\nthe people of Indonesia. It is as simple as that. My\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Minister  for  Culture,   explained\r\n\r\nyesterday the principle of successor States and  the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"national boundaries\" when the  former\r\n\r\ncolonies obtained their independence either  through\r\n\r\nthe  violent  overthrow of the  imperial  powers  or\r\n\r\nthrough negotiations. One of the most amazing things\r\n\r\nin  this business is the attitude of the Dutch.  The\r\n\r\npeople  do not want it; most of the members  of  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  do not want it; it is of no value to  them;\r\n\r\nit brings them no benefit. On\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  it exposes them to  a  tremendous\r\n\r\namount  of  world criticism not only from the  Afro-Asian   States  but  also  from  all  right-thinking\r\n\r\ncountries.  Now  why  they  continue  to  do  so  is\r\n\r\nsomething which I cannot understand, but it  may  be\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a pecular philosophy that  underlies\r\n\r\nthe persistence of imperialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the common factor of imperialism\r\n\r\nis  that  there is a personal gain to those who  set\r\n\r\nout  to  conquer countries, acquire concessions  and\r\n\r\nline  their  pockets.  There is  also  the  gain  in\r\n\r\nprestige to the metropolitan power. When the Western\r\n\r\nEuropean  powers  set  out on  their  vast  imperial\r\n\r\nconquest   in  the  19th  century,  they  tried   to\r\n\r\nrationalise  their  action and give  it  an  air  of\r\n\r\nrespectability. For instance, the British  developed\r\n\r\nthe theme of the white man's burden. They were there\r\n\r\nnot  to  loot India, although Clive, Warren Hastings\r\n\r\nand   others   plundered  India  very   nicely   for\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Nevertheless, the philosophy  developed\r\n\r\nin the 19th century by Western imperialists and each\r\n\r\nof  the major imperial countries - Britain, France and\r\n\r\nHolland - had  different  ways  of  justifying  their\r\n\r\nconquests  to  their  own  people  and  perhaps   to\r\n\r\nthemselves. The British developed the theme  of  the\r\n\r\nwhite  man's burden. They said that they went  there\r\n\r\nreally  to help the black man or the brown man,  and\r\n\r\nin that way they solved their own conscience. On the\r\n\r\nother hand, the French held the view that they  were\r\n\r\nthere  to  bring  a higher form of  civilization  to\r\n\r\ntheir  colonial  territories:  hence  they  had  the\r\n\r\nexpression  \"mission  civilatrice\" - the  ideological\r\n\r\njustification of French imperialism. The  Dutch,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  I  know,  developed what  they  called  the\r\n\r\nethical principle, but it is not very clear in  what\r\n\r\nway  they  have been ethical in their dealings  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  It may be - I think it is rather  doubtful -  that  they think the people who stay in West  Irian\r\n\r\narc ethnically and linguistically different from the\r\n\r\nrest  of  Indonesia  and,  therefore,  to  surrender\r\n\r\nsovereignty  over  West  Irian  to  the   Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment would be to place the people in a form of\r\n\r\ncolonial servitude. Surely this is nonsense, because\r\n\r\nthat  could  be applied in practically  any  of  the\r\n\r\n3,000 islands comprising the Republic of Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere   is   a  tremendous  diversity  of  language,\r\n\r\nreligion  and even culture in this vast archipelago.\r\n\r\nFor  the  Dutch to say. \"This is where  the  ethical\r\n\r\nprinciple would apply and not, say, to the island of\r\n\r\nAmboina  or  Bali,  or Sumatra or Sulewasi,\"  is,  I\r\n\r\nthink, an untenable position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whatever it is, the position of the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nquite  simple. West Irian belongs to Indonesia,  and\r\n\r\nthe  sooner it is returned the better. We prefer  it\r\n\r\nto  be done in a peaceful way. We see that with  the\r\n\r\npressure of world opinion this could be done and  we\r\n\r\nhope  it  would be done. On the other hand, if  West\r\n\r\nIrian  were to be an issue over which war  is  waged\r\n\r\nbetween the Republic of Indonesia and Holland,  then\r\n\r\nthe  danger  of war spreading has to be taken  quite\r\n\r\nseriously.  The  Deputy Prime Minister  has  already\r\n\r\nelaborated on this point and I do not think  I  need\r\n\r\nsay much more. For myself, I would say that not only\r\n\r\nare  the international consequences to be taken into\r\n\r\naccount  but  also  the  internal  effects  on   the\r\n\r\nRepublic   of  Indonesia  itself  should   also   be\r\n\r\nconsidered.  This, of course, is a  matter  for  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Government and the Indonesian  people  to\r\n\r\ndecide upon. It is not for us to tell them what they\r\n\r\nshould  do  or  to draw their attention  to  certain\r\n\r\npossible Consequences. Nevertheless, I think we  are\r\n\r\nwithin  our  rights  to make an  estimation  of  the\r\n\r\npossible consequences of war in West Irian, on, say,\r\n\r\nthe  internal  economic and political  situation  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  If  war  breaks out and  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\narmed forces gain a swift and decisive victory. Then\r\n\r\nI say that will be all to their good. But if, on the\r\n\r\nother hand, the Indonesian armed forces somehow  get\r\n\r\ninvolved  in a protracted war, then it is  a  matter\r\n\r\nfor  some  concern whether the economy of  Indonesia\r\n\r\ncan  stand up to the strain of supporting  a  modern\r\n\r\nwar  in  which  highly  developed  and  very  costly\r\n\r\nweapons  are to be used and have to be paid for.  We\r\n\r\nare  assuming,  of course, that in  this  event  war\r\n\r\nwould  be  confined to just between the two parties.\r\n\r\nBut if, say, other powers move in, then the question\r\n\r\nof  maintaining the cost of the burden of the war on\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian economy does not arise. Other parties\r\n\r\nwould just move in and provide armies, and certainly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  provide  weapons, and possibly  even  provide\r\n\r\narmed forces. Now, if we rule out the possibility of\r\n\r\ndirect  international intervention on both sides  of\r\n\r\nthe struggle, and the war over West Irian becomes  a\r\n\r\nprotracted   affair,   then  the   consequences   of\r\n\r\nsupporting this costly war - and any modern  war  must\r\n\r\nbe extremely costly to wage - will be very damaging to\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian economy when they are now engaged  in\r\n\r\nchanging the whole basis of their economic system to\r\n\r\na completely different one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that the emphasis which the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. laid down on the West Irian issue differs  so\r\n\r\nradically from that of the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stand of the Barisan Sosialis is tins, and it\r\n\r\nis  quite  simple: they are out for a war, and  they\r\n\r\nsay  that  there  is  no point in  negotiating;  the\r\n\r\npatience   of   the  Indonesian  people   has   been\r\n\r\nexhausted. There must be recourse to arms  and  they\r\n\r\ncall  for everyone to support the liberation of West\r\n\r\nIrian  by  force of arms. They are absolutely  cleat\r\n\r\nabout  this. Although the Member for Queenstown  was\r\n\r\nrather  guarded  in his opinion and threat,  be  for\r\n\r\nsome  reason or other was equivocating. He  did  not\r\n\r\nsay  that  he supported a peaceful solution  of  the\r\n\r\nissue. On the other hand, he refrained from going to\r\n\r\nthe  extreme  that  his colleague,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson, did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, these are matters on which I think we must go straight to the oracle - what the Barisan stands for, what the Secretary-General, Mr Lim Ching Siong, stands for. I am going to read to the House an extract from a speech made by Mr Lim Ching Siong at a mass rally on 7th January. There is absolutely no attempt here to take an ambiguous\r\n\r\nposition. Mr Lint Ching Siong is quite frank  about\r\n\r\nthis.  He said the patience of the Indonesian people\r\n\r\nhas  been exhausted. They now want to liberate  West\r\n\r\nIrian by force of arms. They have every right to  do\r\n\r\nso,   and   everyone   should  support   the   armed\r\n\r\nliberation. Not only did he say this, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  said that the issue over Goa clearly shows  that\r\n\r\nconstitutional methods cannot bring about the end of\r\n\r\ncolonialism. May I, Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  quote\r\n\r\nthe  exact  words in Chinese, and I am reading  from\r\n\r\nthe  Sin  Chew  Jit Poh of Monday, 8th  January.  He\r\n\r\nsaid, and I quote the actual words in Chinese;  Chih\r\n\r\nmin chu-i shih pu-neng kou ren ho chih husan he hsia\r\n\r\nte  hsien  tse an pai he chi hsu. It means that  you\r\n\r\ncannot   depend   on  any  level  of  constitutional\r\n\r\narrangement  to bring about the end of  colonialism.\r\n\r\nIn  another instance he said this: Chi-tu kao  hsieh\r\n\r\nhua shih mei yin yung te. It means (if I can give  a\r\n\r\nfree  translation) it is no use fiddling about  with\r\n\r\nconstitutional processes; it just gets you nowhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is in black and\r\n\r\nwhite  in  the Sin Chew Jit Poh, Mr Lim Chin  Siong\r\n\r\nwent  further  and asked the people of Singapore  to\r\n\r\ntake  special note of this point. It is  clear  that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis stand for the use of force not\r\n\r\nonly  in  West  Irian but anywhere where  the  anti-colonial  struggle  is waged  because,  in  his  own\r\n\r\nwords,  \"constitutional processes get you  nowhere\".\r\n\r\nNow,  the Member for Queenstown was not prepared  to\r\n\r\ngo  that  far either at his mass rally  or  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  This  cannot be sad for  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson. We have heard with our own ears that he was\r\n\r\nupbraiding  the  P.A.P: for being unwilling  to  say\r\n\r\nunequivocally and clearly, to use his own words, \"to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  use  of  force  in  the  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nstruggle in this context\". He said it is no  use  to\r\n\r\npay  ho  service  to  the claim  by  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment  to West Irian. You must be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nsay that they arc justified in using force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has never said that force, as a\r\n\r\nweapon of the political struggle, must be ruled  out\r\n\r\nat  all costs, tinder all conditions. We have  never\r\n\r\nsaid  that.  If force must be used, when  all  other\r\n\r\nmeans   have  failed,  then  force  must  be   used.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, do not call yourself a revolutionary. Can\r\n\r\nhe elaborate on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the time when I was a student in\r\n\r\nLondon.  A  very  venerable  gentleman,  who  was  a\r\n\r\nretired Inspector of Schools, saw me and said, \"What\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  this?  I  hear you are sympathetic towards  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Don't   you   know   they   are   dangerous\r\n\r\ncharacters?\"  I said, \"No, I thought they  are  very\r\n\r\ndecent  people.  They  want independence  for  their\r\n\r\ncountry.\"   And   he  said,  \"Yes,   I   also   want\r\n\r\nindependence.  But how far are you prepared  to  go?\r\n\r\nAre  you prepared to use force? Are you prepared  to\r\n\r\nuse arms to get independence?\" And I said, \"Look, if\r\n\r\nevery  other  form  of  constitutional  process  has\r\n\r\nfailed  and  if you cannot get your independence  by\r\n\r\npeaceful   struggle,   by  peaceful   constitutional\r\n\r\nmethods, then if you have to use force and resort to\r\n\r\nan  armed  rebellion, I say, I will  support  it  in\r\n\r\nprinciple.\"  And  if I were asked I were  courageous\r\n\r\nenough, I would say, \"I don't know. I would say that\r\n\r\nif I say that I support an armed struggle, then when\r\n\r\nthe time comes for you to take up arms, you must  do\r\n\r\nit.\" It is as simple as that. Then the man said, \"Do\r\n\r\nyou mean that you are that sort of chap who wants to\r\n\r\nmurder  Englishmen if they will not get out  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry?\" I said, \"Yes, if that is the only  way  to\r\n\r\nget them out, I would.\" He was really aghast, and  I\r\n\r\nquickly assured him that that proposition was purely\r\n\r\nacademic  and that I had no doubt the British  could\r\n\r\nbe got rid of by constitutional processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Barisan and Mr Lim Ching Siong do not\r\n\r\nthink  in  this  way. Neither does  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we say that there should still be\r\n\r\neffort   to  solve  this  problem  of  transfer   of\r\n\r\nauthority  over  West Irian from the  Dutch  to  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government, there is  still  opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  negotiation,  the  Barisan  has  ruled  it  out\r\n\r\ncompletely. Even the Member for Queenstown takes  it\r\n\r\nfor  granted  that  war must be waged.  In  his  own\r\n\r\nwords,  he  says, \"It will not be an  easy  struggle\r\n\r\nagainst  the  superior military might of  the  Dutch\r\n\r\narmed   forces  in  West  Irian,  with  a   possible\r\n\r\nintervention by Australian forces.\" And he  says  he\r\n\r\nadmires  the Indonesian people for their courage  in\r\n\r\nthe face of superior arms, and the tougher they have\r\n\r\nto fight, which means they would have to suffer more\r\n\r\ncasualties, the greater is his admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest to the House that this sort of\r\n\r\nsentiment  is  completely spurious and contemptible?\r\n\r\nIf they believe that West Irian must be liberated by\r\n\r\nforce  of arms, then I say it is their duty  not  to\r\n\r\ninstigate  other  people to fight on  their  behalf.\r\n\r\nThey  should themselves volunteer for the West Irian\r\n\r\ncampaign. And I am putting this proposition to them,\r\n\r\nnot  as a joke but as a serious, proposition.  There\r\n\r\nhave  been  cases i the past where people  from  all\r\n\r\ncountries volunteer to fight on behalf of  a  single\r\n\r\ncountry. The Spanish civil war is a supreme example,\r\n\r\nwhere  people  with strong anti-Fascist  convictions\r\n\r\nwent  in tens of thousands to Spain to fight against\r\n\r\nthe Fascist forces of Franco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will remember that on Wednesday the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park brought up his motion  about\r\n\r\nthe  anti-quated colonial law which says that nobody\r\n\r\ncan recruit Singaporeans to send them abroad. In the\r\n\r\ncourse of the debate on the motion, I made the  same\r\n\r\npoint,  that  the  Barisan Sosialis  should  set  an\r\n\r\nexample  and  register for combat  service  in  West\r\n\r\nIrian.  What  sort of reply did I get, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir?  I  got a very angry reply from the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown. He said that he would go if I went  with\r\n\r\nhim. Sir, this is an utterly ridiculous proposition.\r\n\r\nWe  of  the P.A.P. say, \"Let us explore all peaceful\r\n\r\nmethods  first  and resort to arms  when  all  other\r\n\r\nmethods have failed.\" The Barisan Sosialis wants  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the armed struggle straightaway. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is nonsense for them to say that they will  only\r\n\r\ngo  to  West Irian to volunteer for military service\r\n\r\nif we are prepared to do the same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present age is the age of great\r\n\r\nrevolutions.  In  an age of great  revolutions,  you\r\n\r\nwill  find  that revolutionaries of all descriptions\r\n\r\nsuddenly    come   into   being.   We    have    our\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries in Singapore  - many types of them.  I\r\n\r\npropose   to  divide  them  into  three   types   of\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First the armchair revolutionaries. These are the\r\n\r\nchaps who talk fierce, go back and do nothing.  They\r\n\r\nlead  a  perfectly comfortable life  and  hope  that\r\n\r\nothers  will carry out the revolution. We are  quite\r\n\r\nfamiliar with this type of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries. At best they are pests,  nuisances.\r\n\r\nAt  the worst, they provide great amusement. I  have\r\n\r\nnothing to quarrel with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type we find in abundance in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  will  call  them revolutionaries by  instigation.\r\n\r\nThey believe in a revolution by instigation. They do\r\n\r\nnot  want to fight themselves. They instigate others\r\n\r\nto  fight for them. This type of revolutionaries  is\r\n\r\nfound in abundance in the Barisan Sosialis and other\r\n\r\nCommunist front organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will remember that I have recounted to\r\n\r\nthe  House in the past that the P.A.P., on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  and  the  Communists, their  stooges  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, and their open-front organisations\r\n\r\nin  the  trade  unions  on the  other  hand - the  two\r\n\r\nsides - have come to a collision four times. Round one\r\n\r\nwas  over  the  People's  Association,  where  these\r\n\r\npseudo  revolutionaries made use of some 300 workers\r\n\r\nin  the  People's Association to cause trouble.  The\r\n\r\nresult  is  that 140 of them lost their  jobs.  They\r\n\r\nlost  a  good  career. Round two was over  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil strike when they tried to move in, but  were\r\n\r\neventually  discredited and denounced  by  the  very\r\n\r\nworkers whom they tried to exploit and instigate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen):</b> Point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What has this got to do with\r\n\r\nthe motion before us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am just saying that this\r\n\r\nmotion  proposed by these pseudo revolutionaries  is\r\n\r\nin  keeping with their past conduct.

Now\r\n\r\nthey are trying to make use of innocent Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  fight their battle for them over West Irian.  It\r\n\r\nis so relevant. However unpalatable it may be to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown and the other  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nstooges  in  his  Party, I insist  on  my  right  to\r\n\r\nrecount each and every incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, where were we - round two -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The Hon.

I\r\n\r\nthink,  as  a passing remark, it will be within  the\r\n\r\nambit of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I will go through very quickly\r\n\r\nthe  other  rounds. Now, round three was  when  they\r\n\r\ntried  to  make use of school boys and school  girls\r\n\r\nfor  their own sinister purposes. The pro-Communists\r\n\r\nin   the   Barisan  Sosialis,  in  the   Old   Boys'\r\n\r\nAssociations,  and in certain student  organisations\r\n\r\nin  Nanyang University, tried to make use of  school\r\n\r\nboys  and  school girls for their own  interest.  In\r\n\r\nround  three, they were resoundingly defeated. Round\r\n\r\nfour  was the Work Brigade, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nAnd  they  were all scattered. Round five  has  been\r\n\r\nfought  and ended in a victory for the P.A.P.  Round\r\n\r\nfive  was  the Chinese Chamber of Commerce forum  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Communists  and  their  stooges  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, their open-front leaders  in  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  and in certain student  societies  in\r\n\r\nNanyang   University,  tried  to  manipulate   trade\r\n\r\norganisations and the Chinese guilds to  attack  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

Now,   these  are  the   three   types   of\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries.  I have given sufficient  instances\r\n\r\nto show that the Communists and their stooges in the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  and in the trade  unions  do  not\r\n\r\nfight  the battle themselves. They instigate  others\r\n\r\nto  do  it  : the stall of the People's Association;\r\n\r\nschool  boys and school girls; Work Brigade members.\r\n\r\nThey  even  had  the audacity to try  to  manipulate\r\n\r\nbusinessmen   to  serve  and  advance   their   evil\r\n\r\npurposes.  And over West Irian, if they believe  and\r\n\r\nthey   are  really  genuine  anti-colonialists   - the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson says we are not - let them register\r\n\r\nfor  military  service.  If they  have  no  military\r\n\r\ntraining the Government is quite prepared to provide\r\n\r\ninstructors for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With the approval of the\r\n\r\nAssembly!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> One Member has received\r\n\r\nmilitary  training,  that is the  Member  for  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon, before we sent him for a training  course\r\n\r\nin Israel.

Of course, when  he  went\r\n\r\nthere,  he  wrote me a personal letter  saying,  \"My\r\n\r\nGod, life is really hard here.

If that is what is holding\r\n\r\nthem  back,  that  they have  not  been  trained  as\r\n\r\nsoldiers, we will give them the training. But I have\r\n\r\nno  doubt  that none of them will have the  guts  to\r\n\r\nvolunteer.  In the true tradition of the  Communists\r\n\r\nand  their  stooges, they will try to  make  use  of\r\n\r\nothers and try to get the glory for themselves. They\r\n\r\nare  only  interested in fanning public feelings  on\r\n\r\nthis  issue  and  to make use of it  for  their  own\r\n\r\npolitical advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, there is one point to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  want to draw the attention of  the  House.\r\n\r\nThat  is the rather curious statement by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  when he said that he  was  opposed  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  He  was all for the concept of  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nand  the concept of Malaysia, he reminded the House,\r\n\r\nwas  created  by what he called certain  progressive\r\n\r\nLeft-wing  persons in the past. He was,  of  course,\r\n\r\nreferring to certain Communists. I think two of them\r\n\r\nhad to lice the country to avoid arrest. It is their\r\n\r\nconcept  of  Malaysia which the Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\napproves,  and,  therefore,  I  assume  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  accepts  this concept of  Malaysia.  Under\r\n\r\nthis  plan, the Federation of Malaya, Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo  territories are to be merged  into  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  of Indonesia. Nothing more than  that  and\r\n\r\nnothing  less than that. The Member for Thomson  was\r\n\r\ntherefore  advocating  on  behalf  of  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis that the proper form of Malaysia is for  it\r\n\r\nto be part of the Republic of Indonesia. He made the\r\n\r\nstatement  to  explain  why  he  said  the   present\r\n\r\nMalaysia  plan  was anti, Indonesia.  I  await  with\r\n\r\ngreat  interest  a  statement from  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  to  explain this  away.  This  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong  - Mr Lim Ching Siong is the  oracle  of\r\n\r\nthe   Barisan  Sosialis,  because  he  is  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant    Communist   open   front   leader    in\r\n\r\nSingapore - in  an  article in the Indonesian  journal\r\n\r\nBintang Timor - an Indonesian Communist Party journal -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he opposed the merger proposals  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. because,  in his opinion,  Singapore  should\r\n\r\nmerge  with Indonesia.

Ten  thousand people have died  70,000  have\r\n\r\nbeen  banished;  more than 20,000  detained.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  and I have assured these very foolish  young\r\n\r\nmen and women on the other side - \"For God's sake,  do\r\n\r\nnot  do these foolish things because retribution  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to overtake you. It is inevitable; you cannot\r\n\r\nescape  it.\" Sir, far from being grateful to me  for\r\n\r\ngiving them good advice, they say, \"Well, you  know,\r\n\r\nthe  man  is a Fascist. He wants us locked up\".  But\r\n\r\nthat  is  the very thing I do not want to happen.  I\r\n\r\ntold them, \"Repent in time -\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

You will recollect. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the Member for Thomson spoke at length on  the\r\n\r\natrocities  perpetrated  in  French  and  Portuguese\r\n\r\ncolonial  territories  in  Algeria  and  Angola.  He\r\n\r\nthought that deserves the strongest condemnation. No\r\n\r\none  will dispute that. But I am merely asking  - what\r\n\r\nabout   Budapest?   Surely  the  Hungarian   workers\r\n\r\nthemselves  were  in  open armed  revolt,  with  the\r\n\r\nHungarian army fighting on the side of the Hungarian\r\n\r\nworkers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfighting against the imposition of a Communist rule,\r\n\r\nbacked by the Russian Army. Did he not condemn  that\r\n\r\nas  brutal oppression of a small country by  a  very\r\n\r\nlarge  and  powerful power? All that the Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  then  said was, well, that shows  that  any\r\n\r\nreference  to Angola and Algeria hurts us.  It  does\r\n\r\nnot  hurt  us.  Any reference to the crimes  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunist powers hurts him, as we already know.  Why\r\n\r\ndispute this fact which is known to everybody?  That\r\n\r\nthe  Russians  in their own national self  interests\r\n\r\nsuppress  the  armed revolt of the Hungarian  people\r\n\r\nagainst their rule. That is the point which  I  want\r\n\r\nto make. The Member for Thomson did not reply to it,\r\n\r\nand  I hope the Member for Queenstown, when it comes\r\n\r\nto  his  turn, will duly give a proper and  adequate\r\n\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am surprised\r\n\r\nthat  this  motion  has been moved  by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  and, following the debate in this  Rouse,\r\n\r\nmore  harm  than  good  has been  derived  from  the\r\n\r\nspeeches.  From  the  content of  this  motion,  the\r\n\r\nintention  of the mover is sincere and  honest,  but\r\n\r\ntaking  into  account our position in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nviewing  the  political developments  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthis   has  given  the  picture  of  an  undesirable\r\n\r\natmosphere.  I  am really sorry for  this  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs, but I believe, on the part of the mover  of\r\n\r\nthis motion, this is the objective, this is the true\r\n\r\naim;  in  the  proverbial Malay saying - there  is  a\r\n\r\nnefarious motive behind the moving of this motion by\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are of the opinion that when two people are engaged in a struggle, for another party to take sides and thus create an even more dangerous situation is a bad thing to do. When a man comes across two men engaged in a struggle, that man should try to find a settlement between the two parties. The question I am trying to bring to this\r\n\r\nHouse  is, who is right and who is wrong? It is  the\r\n\r\nquestion of our attitude or stand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntowards  the  people  of  Singapore.  I  hope   that\r\n\r\natrocities  towards  human beings  will  be  avoided\r\n\r\nthroughout the world because we have experienced the\r\n\r\ndire  consequences of war which bring  in  its  wake\r\n\r\nsufferings and hardships to the children who  became\r\n\r\norphans, wives who become widows as a result of war.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to elaborate on this point. If we take\r\n\r\nthis  from the point of view of our ability,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to take sides. I think the difference  is\r\n\r\ngreat.  We are adopting tile attitude of the  mouse-deer  which is trying to follow in the footsteps  of\r\n\r\nthe   elephant.  Firstly,  Singapore   is   not   an\r\n\r\nindependent  country yet. We are  still  confronting\r\n\r\ncolonialism, as has been expressed by my  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Geylang Serai. We can see colonialism\r\n\r\nacross the ocean, hut we are blind to the fact  that\r\n\r\ncolonialism  is  before  our  very  nose.  This   is\r\n\r\nsomething  really astonishing and it clearly  shows,\r\n\r\nas  I  have said earlier, an attempt with a sinister\r\n\r\nmotive. We must cut our coat according to our cloth.\r\n\r\nIf  we  shout at the top of our voice, it will bring\r\n\r\nno gainful results whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if my memory serves me right, the Member for Queenstown did say that he would indeed be concerned if war should break out in Irian Barat. He was concerned that if war broke out there, it would engulf us in Singapore too. Therefore, he urged us to give wholehearted support to the Indonesian struggle. I fail to understand what he\r\n\r\nmeans  by wholehearted support. West Irian is  miles\r\n\r\naway  from us. But would he care to look around  and\r\n\r\nsee  Vietnam or Laos? Is he not concerned about  the\r\n\r\nsituation   in  those  two  countries?  The   recent\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in  West  Irian  give  him  cause  for\r\n\r\nconcern. We have categorically stated our stand. Our\r\n\r\nproblem  in  Singapore is such  that  we  must  save\r\n\r\nourselves  first.  We must first put  our  house  in\r\n\r\norder  before  we can help others. It is  just  like\r\n\r\nputting  the cart before the horse. I say that  this\r\n\r\nis  a  very  illogical reason. The  object  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion contains an ulterior motive. If we follow the\r\n\r\ntactics  of the Barisan Sosialis since the issue  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  came  to the forefront, we can  see  their\r\n\r\nefforts  to bring about disunity between the  people\r\n\r\nof Indonesia and Malaya. Firstly, on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissue  of  Malaysia, as has been  explained  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance just now, the Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis has stated his stand  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  should not merge with the Federation  but\r\n\r\nwith  Indonesia. Secondly, just now the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  has uttered shocking remarks in this  House\r\n\r\nby  alleging  that  the Malaysia Plan  is  an  anti-Indonesia plan. It is as clear as daylight that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis are keen to see chaotic conditions\r\n\r\nhappening  in Malaya and in Indonesia. We  will  not\r\n\r\nentertain that idea. On the contrary, we will  march\r\n\r\nforward.  We  will not be carried away  by  emotions\r\n\r\nbecause  this  will ultimately lead  us   - especially\r\n\r\nhon. Members of this Assembly who are responsible to\r\n\r\nthe people  - towards disaster. It is our duty to lead\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore to the best path, the  path\r\n\r\nof  peace,  and  not lead them for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nachieving  our political ideology or our  own  self-interest.  I describe those politicians who  indulge\r\n\r\nin  tactics  to use mankind for their  own  ends  as\r\n\r\npeople  whose  hands  are covered  with  blood.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, we oppose such tactics. We must oppose such\r\n\r\npoliticians in Singapore who try to lead us  towards\r\n\r\nthe  path  of  disaster and chaos. We  have  set  an\r\n\r\nexample  of  how to struggle to achieve freedom  for\r\n\r\nour State from the colonial powers without resorting\r\n\r\nto  the use of arms we have achieved freedom for our\r\n\r\ncountry  by  a stroke of the pen. Take  for  example\r\n\r\nMalaya:  and we hope too Singapore. We will continue\r\n\r\nwith  our legitimate struggle to free our motherland\r\n\r\nfrom colonial rule. There is no other way. There  is\r\n\r\nno  solution in Indonesia so that Irian Barat can be\r\n\r\nreturned  to  Indonesia which cannot be  solved.  We\r\n\r\nsympathise  with the aspirations and  hopes  of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said just now that we\r\n\r\nhave  set an example of how we struggle here without\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  arms, nor do we indulge in superfluous\r\n\r\nfiery  speeches. Those who take pleasure in shouting\r\n\r\nempty  slogans  to whip up spirit  and  fervour,  in\r\n\r\norder  to  create  disorder, we know  they  want  to\r\n\r\noverwhelm us in Malaya. But despite their efforts to\r\n\r\nbring  about disunity so that we may follow in their\r\n\r\nfootsteps, we are not that stupid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough  the  experience and lessons  that  we  have\r\n\r\nlearnt, I say they have made a grave mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion moved by the Member of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis has no significance at all. It is just like\r\n\r\nadding  fuel to fire. What we should do is to  offer\r\n\r\nconstructive  solutions in  order  to  arrive  at  a\r\n\r\npeaceful settlement. But as I have said earlier  on,\r\n\r\nI  hope  the people will not be misled by the motion\r\n\r\nbefore  the House. The Alliance stand on this motion\r\n\r\nhas been clearly stated. There is no need for me  to\r\n\r\nrepeat it. We know the people will be asking why  we\r\n\r\nhave  taken such a stand, but we feel that it  is  a\r\n\r\nrighteous  one which will lead to goodwill  and  the\r\n\r\nwell-being of all the people in the world. We do not\r\n\r\nwish to instigate anything which will be detrimental\r\n\r\nto any people. We have shown that the problems which\r\n\r\nwe face in Singapore, for instance, the multi-racial\r\n\r\nproblem, can be resolved by negotiations. From  time\r\n\r\nto  time, agreements are reached and accepted by all\r\n\r\nsections.  But  those who are not pleased  with  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  or the progress which we have made  have  a\r\n\r\ndifferent aim. As an example to the world and to the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations, we shall continue to  proceed  with\r\n\r\nour  efforts  until  we have  achieved  the  aim  of\r\n\r\nbuilding a single nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the motion moved by the Member for Queenstown,\r\n\r\nwho  is  better known as the leader of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  is  merely a reaffirmation  of  what  was\r\n\r\nenunciated by the Prime Minister of Singapore in his\r\n\r\njoint   communique  with  Dr  Djuanda,  the   First\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Indonesia, early in 1960.  This  joint\r\n\r\nstatement  made by the representatives  of  the  two\r\n\r\nGovernments  clearly  states  the  stand   and   the\r\n\r\naspirations  of  the people of both territories  who\r\n\r\nare  fighting  to  eradicate  colonialism  in  their\r\n\r\nrespective countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When putting forward his arguments, the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  boastfully mentioned  that  no  one  who\r\n\r\nfights  for peace and independence will oppose  this\r\n\r\nmotion. This is in order to get support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  this  motion. But when he ended his speech,  he\r\n\r\nappealed  to  all  Members of the  House,  including\r\n\r\nthose   on  the  Government  side,  to  give   their\r\n\r\nwholehearted support to it. It is now clear that the\r\n\r\nmotive  behind this motion is clear, because we  the\r\n\r\nGovernment have earlier declared our positive  stand\r\n\r\nalong  with  the  Government of Indonesia  in  their\r\n\r\nstruggle  for  the transfer of sovereignty  of  West\r\n\r\nIrian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when the leader of the Barisan Sosialis, the Member for Queenstown, opened his speech, he proudly said that a mass rally on the issue of Irian Barat had been held. Yes, everybody knows that this mass rally was sponsored by the Barisan Sosialis. When he moved his motion and made his speech, it would appear that he was challenging\r\n\r\nthe political Parties who did\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  hold mass rallies to support Indonesia for  the\r\n\r\ntransfer of Irian Barat. Such Parties which did  not\r\n\r\nhold  mass rallies are considered to be pro-colonial\r\n\r\nParties - this is his logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when we support the struggle of\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian  people, we support  wholeheartedly,\r\n\r\nwith  all  our  sentiments and feelings,  with  deep\r\n\r\nsincerity and honesty -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
