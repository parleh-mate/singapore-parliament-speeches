This immediately drew a great  deal  of\r\n\r\nadverse criticism from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic. I have met hundreds of people since then,\r\n\r\nand  every  time I put the question to them  they\r\n\r\nreturn   the  answer  'No'.  I  put  it  to   the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen, and they are also of that opinion. I\r\n\r\nhave  talked it over with office workers,  clerks\r\n\r\nand all, and they also come forward with the same\r\n\r\nanswer.  I  have even heard from  people  in  the\r\n\r\nstreets - hawkers    and   labourers - people    who\r\n\r\ncongregate  in  their usual  haunts,  say  coffee\r\n\r\nshops, and the conclusion they have ever come  to\r\n\r\nis always 'No'. That is the strong feeling of the\r\n\r\npeople   about   the  appointment  of   Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the other section, we have the Press. They\r\n\r\nare  also  fully  aware of  the  opinion  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, and I think everybody in this House knows\r\n\r\nit.   They  criticise  this  move  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  and  they support the opinion  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. In this one case, we can say that opinion\r\n\r\nin  Singapore is unanimous. They are all  opposed\r\n\r\nto  this  question  of  the appointment  of  more\r\n\r\nAssistant Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their accounts and from the views they have\r\n\r\naired,  the  people of Singapore  have  indicated\r\n\r\nthat this question is one of public interest and,\r\n\r\nsuch being the case, should deserve the attention\r\n\r\nof  the  Assembly. However, as a Member  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse, I have received no official indication  of\r\n\r\nthis  matter  until  after  the  release  of  the\r\n\r\ncorrespondence   between   His   Excellency   the\r\n\r\nGovernor  and  the Chief Minister. I  voice  this\r\n\r\nbecause in a matter which the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nbelieve   to   be   of  great   interest,   their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in this Assembly should,  at  the\r\n\r\nvery least, be given first-hand information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come on to another aspect of the\r\n\r\nquestion.  If public opinion had been taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration - and rightly so - then  this  question\r\n\r\nof  Assistant Ministers would not have plunged us\r\n\r\ninto a constitutional crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What a pity that would have been!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The Chief Minister during\r\n\r\nthe  debate on 18th August informed us  that  the\r\n\r\nappointment of Assistant Ministers is a very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nminor   issue,   that  matters   concerning   the\r\n\r\nconstitution are of the first importance. I agree\r\n\r\nwith that and I think it should remain so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the constitutional crisis is over. We have\r\n\r\ngot  the answer from His Excellency the Governor,\r\n\r\nand  we  have  had the answer to the first  three\r\n\r\nparts   of   the   Resolution   concerning    the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the constitution  given  us.  If\r\n\r\nthis matter of appointment of Assistant Ministers\r\n\r\nwere  to  be pushed, it would seem then that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment side was using that as a lever to  get\r\n\r\nwhat  it wanted. You will note in my motion  that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  say that you must not,  you  cannot,\r\n\r\nappoint Assistant Ministers. We say that  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  time it is undesirable, because it  will\r\n\r\ngive  the people of Singapore a thoroughly  wrong\r\n\r\nimpression, and it will put a thing  that  is  of\r\n\r\nfirst importance in not too good a light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also like to draw the attention of hon.\r\n\r\nMembers of this House to the very small number of\r\n\r\nelected  representatives. We have only 25 elected\r\n\r\nMembers, and this small number is divided between\r\n\r\nthose sitting on the Government side and those on\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition side. That leaves us a  Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment with a total of 13 elected Members, two\r\n\r\nnominated and three official Members. We have  on\r\n\r\nthe Government side nine Ministers, one Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister, and one Deputy Speaker. That leaves  us\r\n\r\nwith  only  seven  Government  Back-benchers.  If\r\n\r\nanother  four  Members were to  be  appointed  as\r\n\r\nAssistant Ministers, then we would have  a  sorry\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs where the Government has  even\r\n\r\nless followers than leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is that not the case?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Should the threat of the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  an Assistant Minister  to  every\r\n\r\nMinistry  be carried out, then we would have  the\r\n\r\nludicrous  situation of the Government having  to\r\n\r\npersuade at least one Member of the Opposition to\r\n\r\njoin  them and be made an Assistant Minister.  My\r\n\r\nsincere  hope  is  that such a  situation  should\r\n\r\nnever  happen  and that Singapore should  not  be\r\n\r\nmade an object of ridicule to the world at large.\r\n\r\nIt is ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again let us remember that of the nine\r\n\r\nMinisters we have on the Government Benches, five\r\n\r\nof  them  are always in the forefront  of  public\r\n\r\nopinion.  They  are  in the forefront  of  public\r\n\r\nopinion  by  virtue of the fact  that  they  were\r\n\r\nelected  by  the  people.  In  the  eyes  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbours, they are the people who are in charge\r\n\r\nof  the  affairs of Singapore for the very  first\r\n\r\ntime. We do agree that their responsibilities are\r\n\r\ngreat, perhaps greater than the official Members,\r\n\r\nbut  let  it  be  said that they are  responsible\r\n\r\npeople,  that they are not afraid of  hard  work,\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  not  afraid of  great,  or  even\r\n\r\ngreater work and responsibilities. Let it be said\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  discharge their responsibilities\r\n\r\nably   and  efficiently.  Any  attempt   to   add\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministers to these Ministries  without\r\n\r\nextremely  good reasons will create an impression\r\n\r\nthat may not be favourable to us, the people  who\r\n\r\nhave a say in the affairs of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now since the subject of the appointment of\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministers was broached - and  it  was  a\r\n\r\nshort  while  back - we  remember  that  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister in an address first said that it was one\r\n\r\nof  necessity.  Later on we  had  another  Press\r\n\r\nrelease  saying that it was one of training.  Now\r\n\r\nwe  agree  that our local people must be trained,\r\n\r\nbut   we   must  also  remember  that   Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters are not going to be our permanent civil\r\n\r\nservants. They may not remain in the service  for\r\n\r\na long time. After receiving their training, they\r\n\r\nmay  not  come  back again. There  are  too  many\r\n\r\nuncertainties.  But  let  us  be  generous  about\r\n\r\nit - they   may  not  want  to  contest  any   more\r\n\r\nelections; they may want to withdraw voluntarily.\r\n\r\nOr  the people may get tired of all this play and\r\n\r\nno  work,  and  they may not be  returned  again.\r\n\r\nThere  are  too many uncertainties. Public  money\r\n\r\nmust  be spent wisely. All the same, the cost  of\r\n\r\ntraining  will  be very high. It  will  cost  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer  $1,500  per month for  every  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister - $18,000   per  annum.   Four   Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters, if appointed, will cost us $72,000 per\r\n\r\nannum. This figure will exceed $160,000 per annum\r\n\r\nif  we  have  all  the  nine Assistant  Ministers\r\n\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking about this because the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  during the elections, did promise  the\r\n\r\nelectorate  that  he  would  keep  the  cost   of\r\n\r\ngovernment down. That was not very long ago.  How\r\n\r\nis   he   going  to  reconcile  this   with   his\r\n\r\nelectorate? This is a matter between him and  his\r\n\r\nconstituency. I would rather leave it at that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose we even agree to the appointment of more\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministers - and we  say  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of training - it must be admitted that most\r\n\r\nof   us   here  are  new  to  this  business   of\r\n\r\ngovernment. We are all learners. If  you  put  an\r\n\r\nAssistant Minister to be guided by another one as\r\n\r\nfresh as the one appointed, it would appear to me\r\n\r\nlike  putting  a person, who is learning  how  to\r\n\r\ndrive  a  car,  under the care and  direction  of\r\n\r\nanother learner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all these things do indicate to us that it\r\n\r\nis  not  desirable at this very moment to appoint\r\n\r\nAssistant Ministers. Perhaps after we have gained\r\n\r\na  little  bit  more experience and  we  have  an\r\n\r\nenlarged  House, this question may be brought  up\r\n\r\nagain. So, Sir, on these grounds, I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House is of opinion that the\r\n\r\nappointment  of more Assistant Ministers  at  the\r\n\r\npresent time is undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  second the motion. The issue before us  is  a\r\n\r\nperfectly  simple one even if recent events  have\r\n\r\ntended to cloud it over. It is whether or not the\r\n\r\nappointment   of   more   Assistant   or   Junior\r\n\r\nMinisters, or Parliamentary Secretaries, will  be\r\n\r\nconducive to better and more efficient government\r\n\r\nwithin  the  context of the present  constitution\r\n\r\nwith   its   Assembly   of   32   Members.    The\r\n\r\nconstitutional question does not enter into  this\r\n\r\nmotion.  It  is purely a question of whether  the\r\n\r\npresent administration will be improved or not by\r\n\r\nsuch appointments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I suggested in this House previously, can it\r\n\r\nreally  be desirable that in a Government  of  18\r\n\r\nMembers, there should be 14 posts - four additional\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministers being the original issue - and\r\n\r\nif  you  like  to  include the  unpaid  posts  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  Whip and Deputy Speaker, 16  or  half\r\n\r\nthis House;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  would  this be desirable even if  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister   could  call  on  all  the  talent   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to pick from? We are not convinced  on\r\n\r\nthis point, nor are we convinced - and this is  the\r\n\r\nreal   issue - that  it  will  result   in   really\r\n\r\nefficient government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the proper functions of Ministers?\r\n\r\nSurely  these do not and need not go beyond  the\r\n\r\ndictation  of policy, the control of  policy  and\r\n\r\nthe  issuing  of  directives to  see  that  their\r\n\r\npolicy  is carried out by the departments through\r\n\r\nthe  Permanent Secretaries? I will grant that  it\r\n\r\nmay take three months, or even six months, for  a\r\n\r\nnew  Minister to find this out and find his feet,\r\n\r\nbut  after that, he should be on top of his  job.\r\n\r\nThe  fact of the matter is that there are now two\r\n\r\nmen  at  the  top - the Minister and the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary - to   drive   the   machinery   of   the\r\n\r\ndepartment,  instead of one as before.  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters would make it three instead of one, and\r\n\r\nanyone  who  knows anything about  administration\r\n\r\nsurely  knows that too many men at the  top  mean\r\n\r\nbottlenecks  and  delay,  or  contradictions  and\r\n\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what are the Assistant Ministers functions\r\n\r\nto   be?  They  cannot  take  full  charge  of   a\r\n\r\ndepartment,  as  they  must always  refer  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  who  is responsible to the  Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters for the policy laid down by him. If they\r\n\r\nare  to  be  understudies, then they are  to  gain\r\n\r\nexperience  from  those who themselves  are  still\r\n\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, however, a clue, and a very disturbing\r\n\r\nclue,  in a statement the Chief Minister made  to\r\n\r\nthe  Press  sometime ago stating his reasons  for\r\n\r\nwanting  Assistant Ministers.  His  third  reason\r\n\r\napparently  was to strengthen his hold  over  the\r\n\r\nnon-domiciled  civil service to ensure  that  his\r\n\r\nnew  policies are carried out. Now the Press  may\r\n\r\nhave misquoted him, and I am sure my hon. Friend\r\n\r\nwill  correct me if I am wrong, but I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  to  mean, firstly, that expatriate officers\r\n\r\nare  not loyally carrying out the policies of the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and secondly, the Assistant Ministers\r\n\r\nare   intended  to  be  bearers  from  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  of  directives on policy in departments\r\n\r\nin   which  the  Chief  Minister  has  no  direct\r\n\r\ncontrol. The first is a very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserious allegation to make.

But it may be that  finding\r\n\r\nthat this was not a popular move in more quarters\r\n\r\nthan one that the Government has been looking for\r\n\r\na  way out, and it has been re-reading the Rendel\r\n\r\nReport  with  its reference to the fact  that  an\r\n\r\nAssistant   Minister  might   be   appointed   to\r\n\r\nunderstudy  the  Financial  Secretary,  with  its\r\n\r\nlogical   extension  to  the   other   ex-officio\r\n\r\nportfolios. Now if the Rendel Report is to be our\r\n\r\nBible -  and it seems to be very much  less  of  a\r\n\r\nBible  than  it  was a few weeks  ago  when  this\r\n\r\nmotion was first tabled - there might be something\r\n\r\nin  this  argument,  on two conditions:  firstly,\r\n\r\nthat  there are men of the highest qualifications\r\n\r\non   the  Government  side  today  available   to\r\n\r\nunderstudy   one   or  more  of   these   onerous\r\n\r\nportfolios; secondly, that they would, in fact, he\r\n\r\ntrained  with a view to their taking  over  these\r\n\r\nportfolios  in the near future. I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nthat  these  conditions can be fulfilled  at  the\r\n\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue before us, therefore, is\r\n\r\nthis:  Will the Assistant Ministers' appointments\r\n\r\nproduce a more efficient administration? If hon.\r\n\r\nMembers think that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  will  not - I have given reasons to show  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  ill-conceived - then they must  vote  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  this motion. If the Chief Minister  is\r\n\r\nstill  seriously  considering the appointments  of\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries,\r\n\r\nwhichever you like to call them, I would  ask  him\r\n\r\nto  ponder once more in all seriousness: Will  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, which is almost all Front  Bench  with\r\n\r\nno  Back-benchers,  be  a satisfactory  democratic\r\n\r\ngovernment? Will it not suffer from a lack of self-criticism?  Will it not be rather too  subservient\r\n\r\nto  the  policies of the Chief Minister, resulting\r\n\r\nin  autocratic  and  not  democratic  methods,   a\r\n\r\ntendency  which we of the Progressive  Party  have\r\n\r\ncriticised in the past with real concern?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

It has only a\r\n\r\npopulation  of  1,200,000,  one-thirtieth  part  of\r\n\r\nCalcutta, our nearest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncity. Up to the time of the election, the cost  of\r\n\r\nrunning  the  government was 53 to  55  per  cent,\r\n\r\nwhich is indeed very, very high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, after the election, you have Ministers\r\n\r\nwith   their  salaries,  their  staff  with  their\r\n\r\nsalaries,  with  their  entertainment   plus   the\r\n\r\nexpenses of cameramen to give them publicity! Sir,\r\n\r\nthis all adds to the cost from the revenue. How is\r\n\r\nit  to be met? I have said on many occasions  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  got  no natural resources. To  meet  the\r\n\r\ncost,  we will have to find a way to increase  the\r\n\r\nrevenue,  which will be a burden not only  to  the\r\n\r\nrich, but also to the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before this Government came into power, or\r\n\r\nbefore  the election, we had hon. Members  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative   Council  who   did   the   work   of\r\n\r\nlegislation   and   also   ran   the    Government\r\n\r\ndepartments. Those gentlemen are now the Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries, and they are very efficient men. They\r\n\r\nare  not to do any legislative work now, but their\r\n\r\nwhole  time is to be devoted to carrying  out  the\r\n\r\npolicies laid down by the Ministers. When you have\r\n\r\ngot  such  efficient men at the helm to carry  out\r\n\r\nthe  policies  of  the  Ministers,  where  is  the\r\n\r\nnecessity of having further Assistant Ministers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Labour Front we have ten elected\r\n\r\nMembers. Out of them, four are Ministers  and  one\r\n\r\nis  an Assistant Minister. I do not count the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Communications and  Works  (Mr\r\n\r\nFrancis  Thomas) because he is a nominated Member.\r\n\r\nHe  is  sitting  there  at  the  pleasure  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. If the Government falls, he also falls\r\n\r\ntoo;  so  I  do  not count him at  all.  So,  five\r\n\r\nelected  Labour Front Members have got,  should  I\r\n\r\nsay,  jobs,  or  should I say, Ministerial  posts,\r\n\r\nthen  only  five are left. Out of  them,  two  are\r\n\r\nrecommended  to be Assistant Ministers,  according\r\n\r\nto  the  correspondence between the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nand  His  Excellency which has been circulated  to\r\n\r\nus - one  to  be drawn from the Opposition  and  one\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Alliance. In other words, out  of  ten,\r\n\r\nseven  Labour  Front  elected  Members  will  have\r\n\r\nMinisterial posts if they are nominated.  This  is\r\n\r\nvery  ridiculous - out of ten, seven  getting  jobs,\r\n\r\nthree as Back-benchers. Why is this being done?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have here the Progressive Party, very\r\n\r\nlong  and  well established. Here  you  have  got\r\n\r\nanother   very  big  Party  called  the  P.A.P. - a\r\n\r\nregular  Party.  Then you have got  the  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nAlliance. They are all regular Parties, having  a\r\n\r\npaying  membership,  having  regular  monthly  or\r\n\r\nyearly meetings, and having their own offices. In\r\n\r\nother  words,  these Parties are  run  on  proper\r\n\r\nparty lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now take the Labour Front Party. What is it? Is\r\n\r\nit a Party? If I may be allowed to quote, a Press\r\n\r\ndigest  dated  16th July, 1955, of  a  vernacular\r\n\r\nnewspaper - it is the Tamil Murasu, a Tamil  paper,\r\n\r\nSir. I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Chief Minister of Singapore has explained\r\n\r\nand  given  his reasons for attempting to  appoint\r\n\r\nfour   Assistant  Ministers,  but  none  of  these\r\n\r\nreasons  seems to be satisfactory to  anyone.  The\r\n\r\nargument  that  the  administration  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncould  be  carried on effectively  only  with  six\r\n\r\nMinisters and five Assistant Ministers is  not  an\r\n\r\nappropriate one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differences of opinion existed within the Labour\r\n\r\nFront, even the Ministers chosen for the Council\r\n\r\nof  Ministers. The Chief Minister may deny  this,\r\n\r\nand  say that all is well with the Labour  Front,\r\n\r\nbut  those who are aware of the condition of  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front would not accept this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the work of the Labour Front was a\r\n\r\ncomplicated affair. The leaders of the Party have\r\n\r\nno  opportunity  to  do the things  which  would\r\n\r\nestablish the Party in a proper manner. Even they\r\n\r\ncould not answer the question whether or not  the\r\n\r\nParty has developed and taken its full shape.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this is the position: here is the\r\n\r\nLabour Front Party in coalition with the Alliance\r\n\r\nrunning the government, and in order to keep  the\r\n\r\nParty members together - if this is an insinuation,\r\n\r\nSir, I am willing to withdraw it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

They  should look at other  countries.\r\n\r\nThere  they  have  Ministers who  have  their  own\r\n\r\nincome or who live in a very modest way. They draw\r\n\r\nno  salary;  or even if they draw a  salary,  they\r\n\r\ngive  it  back to the revenue. Now,  this  is  the\r\n\r\nposition: if Singapore is to develop in  a  proper\r\n\r\nway,  I  think  an example should be  set  by  the\r\n\r\nMinisters or the Government in power that they  do\r\n\r\nnot further draw on the purse of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, there is one surprising\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding - I see the Member for  Telok  Paku\r\n\r\nis running away -!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Even  one\r\n\r\nstudent would need a teacher, although that  same\r\n\r\nteacher  can teach 10 students or 20  or  30:  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, I regret to say 40, which is too  many;\r\n\r\nbut  the  fact remains that if you are  going  to\r\n\r\nhave any teaching at all, you have got to have  a\r\n\r\nteacher,  and  if your school is  going  to  have\r\n\r\nseveral  teachers,  you  have  got  to   have   a\r\n\r\nprincipal  in charge of them. You will  seek,  no\r\n\r\ndoubt,  to  have an appropriate number of  pupils\r\n\r\nper  teacher,  but  if  you  are  going  to  have\r\n\r\nteachers,  you must have them and you  cannot  run\r\n\r\nthe  school  without them. In the same  way,  the\r\n\r\nfact  that Singapore has a small population  does\r\n\r\nnot mean that, therefore, you have not got to see\r\n\r\nto  the  work that has got to be done. The office\r\n\r\nwork   remains  substantially  the  same  without\r\n\r\nregard to the actual size of the territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion was made by one speaker from the\r\n\r\nOpposition  that the Permanent Secretaries  could\r\n\r\ndo  most  of  the work and the Ministers  confine\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  thinking  out  present  plans  of\r\n\r\npolicy  and  then  saying, 'Permanent  Secretary,\r\n\r\nwill  you please carry this out for me?' and then\r\n\r\nI  suppose go home for a cup of tea! It does  not\r\n\r\nwork  like that at all. It is not in the least  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of merely saying, 'We would like  you  to\r\n\r\nknow this is our policy and will you now carry it\r\n\r\nout  for  us?'  That would not  be  a  democratic\r\n\r\nprocess  at  all. There is a very great  deal  of\r\n\r\noffice work. I cannot possibly describe it to you\r\n\r\nin  detail, but I would suggest you come and look\r\n\r\nat my office sometime and see the number of files\r\n\r\nthat  I  have to pass across my desk. Apart  from\r\n\r\nthe  formulation of policy, there is an  enormous\r\n\r\nbulk  of  routine work that has to go across  the\r\n\r\nMinister's    desk   because   he   is    finally\r\n\r\nresponsible. It is perfectly impossible  to  say,\r\n\r\n'I   will  sign  everything  that  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary  puts before me, without  reading  it.'\r\n\r\nTake   an   example  in  my  own  Ministry.   Air\r\n\r\nNavigation  Orders have to be revised.  What  you\r\n\r\nsee  at  the  end  is a sheet or  so  of  Gazette\r\n\r\nNotification, but what, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact, have passed across my desk are four or five\r\n\r\nbulky  files dating back to pre-war and recording\r\n\r\nmassive  memoranda  from the International  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation  Organisation  and  the  interpretations\r\n\r\nadopted elsewhere. A tremendous bulk of stuff has\r\n\r\nto  be  studied which has very little to do  with\r\n\r\nthe  formulation of policy but is merely  routine\r\n\r\nwork. The more the routine work fills the time of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, the less time he obviously has  to\r\n\r\ndevote  to,  what you very rightly  say, is  his\r\n\r\nbasic  duty, the formulation of policy  which  is\r\n\r\nbased on discussions, investigations and study at\r\n\r\nvery considerable length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to refer also to a\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  by  another   Member   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  who  seems to  have  been  trying  to\r\n\r\nconduct a sort of Gallup Poll at cocktail parties\r\n\r\nand  in  the coffee-shops of Singapore. He  comes\r\n\r\nback  with  a statement that hundreds  of  people\r\n\r\nhave  all  agreed with him. Now, that  calls  for\r\n\r\ncomment  indeed, considering the  people  he  has\r\n\r\nselected to speak to, where everyone agrees  with\r\n\r\nhim. I am going to say that a Gallup Poll is  not\r\n\r\na  thing  which you can conduct on the  basis  of\r\n\r\ncocktail parties and coffee-shops, or even  going\r\n\r\nround  labourers'  lines. It is a  scientifically\r\n\r\nconducted  survey which must be done  by  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  known to be impartial and  who  take  a\r\n\r\nproper  segment of the population on a scientific\r\n\r\nbasis  of  selection. No weight whatever  can  be\r\n\r\nattached  to going round talking to your  friends\r\n\r\nand  finding that they agree with you - they  would\r\n\r\nnot be your friends if they did not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  cannot see my way clear to support the  motion\r\n\r\nbefore this House.

I said: \"If  I  get  the\r\n\r\nprinciple   acceded  to,  I  will   reconsider - not\r\n\r\nforego.\"  There  is  a  distinction  there,  which\r\n\r\nshould be obvious particularly to a legal mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, may I say this: that in\r\n\r\nthe  context  and  in the circumstances  in  which\r\n\r\nthose  words  were said, 'reconsider'  could  only\r\n\r\nmean reconsider and arrive at some decision other\r\n\r\nthan  the  one he had already arrived  at. It  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that,  on  this issue,  he  should  not\r\n\r\nmisjudge  popular feeling. We would saw  that,  in\r\n\r\nprinciple,  there  is nothing wrong  with  it.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  there is nothing wrong in getting  on  even\r\n\r\nwith  nine  Assistant Ministers if that will  make\r\n\r\nthe  Government succeed. The fact that this  House\r\n\r\nis  so  small,  as  we have been reminded  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanglin (Mr John Ede), was because  of\r\n\r\nthe  doings of his friends who arranged that  this\r\n\r\nHouse should be small. At the time it was done, we\r\n\r\nall  said that it was foolish and impractical, but\r\n\r\nin those days there were men in power steeped in a\r\n\r\ndifferent  tradition. They were only in favour  of\r\n\r\nself-government or any political advance in so far\r\n\r\nas  it suited their personal ends. So far as  they\r\n\r\ncould  see,  their personal ends would  have  been\r\n\r\nadvanced suitably in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  little  Assembly where they  were  all  friends\r\n\r\ntogether  and where they all got on well together.\r\n\r\nThey  quarrelled about the little things and  they\r\n\r\nagreed on all the big things, such as helping each\r\n\r\nother get on in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the position has now changed. It is no\r\n\r\nlonger a question of a political Party gaining the\r\n\r\nascendancy  for  party  kudos  and  for   personal\r\n\r\nadvancement. We are confronted - the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty is proud of having played a part in creating\r\n\r\nthis  new  condition - with a  real  challenge:  you\r\n\r\neither  make democracy work or you perish!  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  we  want to make democracy work  that  we\r\n\r\ntell  the  Chief Minister today, \"If he  feels  he\r\n\r\nneeds  these men, we wish him well, let  him  have\r\n\r\nthem.\"  But  it  is also because we  want  him  to\r\n\r\nsucceed  that  we ask him to reconsider,  at  this\r\n\r\nmoment - I  use my words advisedly - \"the advisability\r\n\r\nof  proceeding  with something which,  rightly  or\r\n\r\nwrongly may be misconstrued by a large section  of\r\n\r\nthe  population\". But he is the best judge of  his\r\n\r\nown  needs.  There  is  no question  of  principle\r\n\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall definitely not support this motion and,\r\n\r\nin  case  it  is misconstrued, we shall  also  not\r\n\r\noppose it.

Sir,  Singapore was very nearly  ridiculed\r\n\r\nlast  week when the Opposition walked out of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and failed to carry out their duties  as\r\n\r\nhonourable  representatives of the public  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Opinion in Singapore is unanimous against the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  Assistant  Ministers\",  says  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Serangoon, and he goes on to say  that\r\n\r\npublic   opinion  should  have  been  taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration. Who is and what is public  opinion,\r\n\r\nSir?  Who tells the Member of public opinion? Sir,\r\n\r\nI  contend  that we, who sit here in  this  House,\r\n\r\nrepresent  public opinion, and public  opinion  is\r\n\r\nreflected through us in this Assembly -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Just you wait till the next\r\n\r\nelection!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The Rendel Constitution  was\r\n\r\ntailored by them to suit their own needs. Probably\r\n\r\nthey  thought  that they could not produce  enough\r\n\r\ntalent to fill more seats, and so they kept it  to\r\n\r\na very low figure; as the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nsaid - a  cosy  gathering  that  would  quarrel  amongst\r\n\r\nthemselves but still get along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, the Member for Serangoon says that\r\n\r\nthe  Press has been against it and that the  Press\r\n\r\nare fully aware of the opinion of the people. That\r\n\r\nis  wrong. The Press are not aware of the  opinion\r\n\r\nof the people. If they were, they would be sitting\r\n\r\nin  this  House in your seats, The Press do  guide\r\n\r\npublic  opinion  according to what their  backseat\r\n\r\ndrivers  want them to. Some sections of the  Press\r\n\r\nhave always been interested parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one cannot help feeling that no real\r\n\r\nargument has been advanced against the appointment\r\n\r\nof   more  Assistant  Ministers.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  mentioned  training  and  he  dwelt  at\r\n\r\nlength  on  public money being spent  on  training\r\n\r\nwhen  one never knows whether these Ministers will\r\n\r\nbe returned in the next election. I say, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthe  more people you train, the more chances there\r\n\r\nare  that  at least some of them will be returned.\r\n\r\nProbably  he  does not want that - I think  he  does\r\n\r\nnot.  Anyhow, Sir, as I see it, no valid  argument\r\n\r\nhas   been  put  before  this  house  against  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  Assistant  Ministers  except  the\r\n\r\nwishful  thinking  that there should  be  no  more\r\n\r\nMinisters,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very much\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  this, but I am now  speaking  as  an\r\n\r\nelected  Member of this Assembly without  fear  or\r\n\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, Sir that we have wasted much time in\r\n\r\ndebating this motion. We all have our own work  as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in our own divisions, and if I had\r\n\r\nbeen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelieved  half an hour ago, I feel  that  I  would\r\n\r\nhave done a good job by helping my constituency in\r\n\r\nsome measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first instance, I feel that this motion\r\n\r\nis   quite  unparliamentary  because  it   is   an\r\n\r\nanticipated  one. Normally, people who  understand\r\n\r\nparty  government will wait for the Government  to\r\n\r\nbring  in a motion, or bring in a financial  vote,\r\n\r\nfor the appointment of the Assistant Ministers and\r\n\r\ntheir  salaries. Members opposite would  naturally\r\n\r\ntake that opportunity to attack the Government  on\r\n\r\nthe measures against it. We would then all have  a\r\n\r\ngreater  opportunity  of hearing  from  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  his valid arguments for the  appointment\r\n\r\nof  these Ministers. As such, Sir, I believe  that\r\n\r\nthis  motion is a very hasty one and it has spoilt\r\n\r\nall the taste of a very interesting debate yet  to\r\n\r\ncome.  Actually, Sir, the mover has put  the  cart\r\n\r\nbefore the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate, I listened to an hon.\r\n\r\nMember   who   said  that,  in  the   past,   some\r\n\r\ndepartments  were  carrying out  their  work  very\r\n\r\nefficiently but that Member has forgotten the fact\r\n\r\nthat,  in  the  past,  it  was  not  democracy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It was absolute bureaucracy, and in  an\r\n\r\nelected  Assembly  like this, where  the  majority\r\n\r\nParty  runs  the government, it is no  use  saying\r\n\r\nthat  all  work can be carried out by the previous\r\n\r\nheads  of  departments  who  are  now  acting   as\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretaries.  This  is  a  transitional\r\n\r\nperiod when many of the old laws, regulations  and\r\n\r\npolicies need revision to suit the policies of the\r\n\r\nnew  Government and which will also have an effect\r\n\r\non  the lives of the people and as such, I believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  new Government may require a  few  more\r\n\r\nhands to assist them in their duties. That is  not\r\n\r\nunnatural.   Probably  Singapore   is   the   only\r\n\r\nterritory in the whole world where there exist  no\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries in the so-called Cabinet\r\n\r\nsystem. If any hon. Member of this House can point\r\n\r\nout  to  me  one country where there is a  Cabinet\r\n\r\nGovernment  without Parliamentary  Secretaries,  I\r\n\r\nwill bow to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the position today and I think, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  a  matter  like this must be very  carefully\r\n\r\ndebated  without attaching unnecessary  prejudices\r\n\r\nnot only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the functions of the Government but also to the\r\n\r\nindividuals  concerned. We also have  to  remember\r\n\r\nthat  we  must  have a complete knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  a government which  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nvarious  aspects of public affairs.  But,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, Sir, if we regard government  affairs\r\n\r\nas  a  minor  matter, then we  will  be  advancing\r\n\r\nreasons  not only of the type that we  heard  from\r\n\r\nthe  mover, but also very many other reasons which\r\n\r\nprobably  some of those people who may  understand\r\n\r\nthese problems will not agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the Chief Minister of any\r\n\r\nelected government is a man who is more capable of\r\n\r\nunderstanding the functions of the government  and\r\n\r\nthe  volume of work it has to undertake, and I  am\r\n\r\nin no position to express any strong views on this\r\n\r\nmatter. I think the next opportunity that I  would\r\n\r\ntake  to express my views would be when the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister brings in an appropriate motion  for  the\r\n\r\napproval of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I must remind this Assembly\r\n\r\nthat   I  am  perfectly  satisfied  to  serve   my\r\n\r\nconstituency  and the people of  Singapore  in  my\r\n\r\npresent   position.  I  have   not   indulged   in\r\n\r\ncanvassing for any personal ambition, and my  only\r\n\r\nambition is to serve the people and as long  as  I\r\n\r\nget  that opportunity, I am satisfied but, on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  if  any  member  of  the  public  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  misunderstands  my  attitude  in   this\r\n\r\nmatter, I can only say he will realise it when the\r\n\r\ntime comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while the\r\n\r\nmain issue in this debate is whether or not at the\r\n\r\npresent  time it is desirable to appoint Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters,  with the underlying criticism  of  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister's selection some weeks ago, and  is\r\n\r\na  matter  which this House should decide  and  on\r\n\r\nwhich  I, as an ex-officio Member of the House,\r\n\r\nshould  probably not express any view;  but  there\r\n\r\nare  two  points  which have been  raised  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate on which I should like to express my view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first was a phrase used by the hon. Member\r\n\r\nwho  moved this motion, in which he suggested that\r\n\r\nMinisters   of   the  Government   should   devote\r\n\r\nthemselves to hard work rather than to play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,  I  am  quite sure that the hon.  Member,  in\r\n\r\nusing  that phrase, spoke from far less  knowledge\r\n\r\nof the activities of Ministers than I myself have,\r\n\r\nand  I  do  welcome  this  opportunity,  Sir,   of\r\n\r\nassuring  him and all hon. Members of  this  House\r\n\r\nthat the Ministers of this Government have devoted\r\n\r\nthemselves  quite untiringly to  the  tasks  which\r\n\r\nhave  fallen to them. The House will, I  am  sure,\r\n\r\nappreciate  that it is no easy task for  Ministers\r\n\r\nto  take  over the government in the way that  our\r\n\r\npresent  Ministers have had to  do.  The  task  of\r\n\r\nfamiliarising themselves with the organisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  government  machinery: the  task  of  forming\r\n\r\ntheir  policies and relating them to what  can  be\r\n\r\ndone:  that  alone was enormous.  In  addition  to\r\n\r\nthat, the Government has had to face at least  two\r\n\r\nvery   severe  tests,  tests  which   would   have\r\n\r\nchallenged  any  government  with  many  years  of\r\n\r\nexperience. So I do assure Members of  this  House\r\n\r\nthat,  as  far  as  the  appointed  Ministers  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, their life during the last three months\r\n\r\nhas  been  far more all work and no play than  any\r\n\r\nsuggestion of play before work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I should like to make,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  to try to clear up what I think is  some\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  about the  relationship  between\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service, the permanent civil  servants\r\n\r\nand  the Ministers. It is easy to suggest that the\r\n\r\nphrases,  used some time ago by the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nin   which  he  referred  to  the  necessity  for\r\n\r\nMinisters  keeping a close control  on  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice,  were  a reflection on the integrity  and\r\n\r\nthe  loyalty  of the civil service.  But  I  think\r\n\r\nthose  who  make  that reflection have  not  fully\r\n\r\nappreciated  the basic position of the  Government\r\n\r\ntoday.  We have made a fundamental change  in  the\r\n\r\nwhole system of government. We now have an elected\r\n\r\nGovernment  of the people deciding its policy  and\r\n\r\npassing  those  decisions to the  permanent  civil\r\n\r\nservice  to carry out. Both the civil service  and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers are newcomers to this  system.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  that has been elected is a Government\r\n\r\nwhich differs radically from previous Governments.\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable, therefore, that its policies and\r\n\r\nits   approach   to   problems,  including   minor\r\n\r\nproblems, will be radically\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent   from   the   approach   of    previous\r\n\r\nGovernments. It is therefore inevitable  that  the\r\n\r\npermanent members of the civil service do  require\r\n\r\nmuch  more  detailed and day-to-day  direction  on\r\n\r\npolicy  than they required in the past, when  they\r\n\r\ncould  assume the general direction in  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  moving. The fact that  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  has stated - in my view quite rightly - that\r\n\r\nit  is necessary for Ministers to exercise a close\r\n\r\ncontrol  over the service is not, in my view,  any\r\n\r\nreflection  at  all  on  the  integrity  and   the\r\n\r\ndevotion to duty of the members of that service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

It  seems,  Sir,   it   is\r\n\r\nimpossible  to  say  anything, even  \"Thank  you\",\r\n\r\nwithout  being  maliciously  misinterpreted,   but\r\n\r\nthere  was never any question in my mind, then  or\r\n\r\nnow,  to  suggest lack of integrity or loyalty  on\r\n\r\nthe   part  of  the  civil  service  when  I  drew\r\n\r\nattention to the vital necessity of proper control\r\n\r\nand  direction  in the Ministries; and  I  repeat,\r\n\r\nthere exists a vital necessity there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going through a period of revolution,\r\n\r\nbloodless    and    peaceful,    but    revolution\r\n\r\nnevertheless.

I am not quite  certain\r\n\r\nwhether  the Chief Minister was relevant  when  he\r\n\r\nbrought  in  what he has just brought in  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate.  Let  us try to confine ourselves  to  the\r\n\r\nmotion before the House - that is whether or not  at\r\n\r\nthe   present   moment  Assistant  Ministers   are\r\n\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

I have no other purpose  than\r\n\r\nthat  and I trust you will permit it to remain  on\r\n\r\nthe record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a curious conception on the part of the\r\n\r\nOpposition  that  they  can control  every  single\r\n\r\nmovement of mine in Government, and the leader  of\r\n\r\nthe  Democratic Party, in fact, went so far as  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that there should be a Committee appointed\r\n\r\nto  teach me how to suck eggs - if you will  forgive\r\n\r\nthat  schoolboy expression, but it is no more than\r\n\r\nthat - a Committee to be appointed to consider  what\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministers I should have - the  height  of\r\n\r\nimpudence -!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

It is suggested, Sir, that the appointment\r\n\r\nof  a large number of persons to be Ministers  and\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministers will destroy  the  democratic\r\n\r\nprocess.  That  is not fully accurate  because  we\r\n\r\nhave,  in any event - as Parties opposite are  fully\r\n\r\nconscious - a Whip. Parties opposite themselves have\r\n\r\nused   it   to   considerable   effect - detrimental\r\n\r\nperhaps - when they walked out of this Assembly only\r\n\r\nlast  week,  but  there is a Whip. Government  can\r\n\r\ncontrol Backbenchers by using the Whip without any\r\n\r\nquestion   of   appointing   them   as   Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a remark made by the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  to which I take strong exception,  and  I\r\n\r\nchallenge  him to clarify it unless,  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nmade  in the normal traditional course which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  indicated by that Party in the past. He says\r\n\r\nthat  Government  has indicated  that  it  has  no\r\n\r\npolicy  on  a  large number of  matters  of  grave\r\n\r\nimportance.

I would like to say this: that  when  I\r\n\r\ndid  indicate I would reconsider the  position,  I\r\n\r\nmeant  it;  and  depending upon  this  debate  and\r\n\r\ndepending  upon the voting - because if  the  voting\r\n\r\ngoes  against  me, quite naturally,  Sir,  however\r\n\r\nimproper  I might think it is, I would accept  the\r\n\r\ndirection  of this House - but depending  upon  this\r\n\r\ndebate  and  what  has  transpired  during   these\r\n\r\nproceedings, as well as what has transpired in the\r\n\r\nintervening   period   since   the   exchange   of\r\n\r\ncorrespondence with His Excellency on the subject,\r\n\r\nit   is  my  intention  to  reconsider  the  whole\r\n\r\nquestion   of   the   appointment   of   Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am conscious that we have no Angel Gabriels\r\n\r\non  our  side of the House. I do not know  if  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  pretend to have any. I do not  pretend\r\n\r\nto  be  an Attlee or a Nehru, Sir. We have to  use\r\n\r\nthe  tools we have. If our ancestors who lived  in\r\n\r\ncaves  waited  for  the crane  and  the  pneumatic\r\n\r\ndrill,  they would still live in caves. We  cannot\r\n\r\nwait  for  perfection and the perfect Minister  in\r\n\r\norder  to  fill appointments which are  essential\r\n\r\nfor our daily work.

That I believe,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  will never, at any time, consider  the\r\n\r\nquestion   of  appointment  or  the  question   of\r\n\r\nutilisation of any of my powers otherwise than for\r\n\r\nthe welfare of the people of this territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been one further suggestion made - by\r\n\r\nimplication - by the Member for Telok Ayer,  and  it\r\n\r\nis  that I seek to appoint Assistant Ministers for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of unifying my Back-benchers.  It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to follow the logic, Sir, because to the\r\n\r\nnormally  intelligent person, it must  immediately\r\n\r\nbe  appreciated that the suggestion that a  Member\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition - not  so  much  Opposition - but  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that an Independent should  be  chosen\r\n\r\nfor  the post of Assistant Minister must instantly\r\n\r\nand  quite  naturally rouse antagonism amongst  my\r\n\r\nown  Back-benchers, and if that  is  considered  a\r\n\r\nunifying  force, I find it a little bit  difficult\r\n\r\nto understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, Sir, what has already been made\r\n\r\nabundantly clear.

There are three ex-officio Ministries  to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am  very  anxious to  appoint  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters and frankly - [Interruption.] -  as  I  see\r\n\r\nthings at the present moment, Mr Speaker - you will\r\n\r\nforgive,  I  trust, the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\n(Mr Lee Kuan Yew) who only loves hearing his  own\r\n\r\nvoice,  and I have been somewhat long  on  my  own\r\n\r\nfeet - but I was suggesting, Sir, that the  type  of\r\n\r\npersons  we want to put in as Assistant  Ministers\r\n\r\nin  the  ex-officio Ministries must be men of  the\r\n\r\nvery first calibre and it is my intention - I do not\r\n\r\nknow  whether it will be possible, but as soon  as\r\n\r\nsome Assistant Ministers have proved in my view to\r\n\r\nbe  adequate  to take over Ministries - to  ask  the\r\n\r\nexisting Ministers to allow themselves to  be,  at\r\n\r\nleast,  technically demoted in order to  serve  in\r\n\r\nthe  ex-officio Ministries, because to  me  it  is\r\n\r\nvital  to  have able men in those Ministries  very\r\n\r\nsoon  and that.

In the circumstances,  I\r\n\r\nthink  I will refrain from further addressing  the\r\n\r\nHouse  and,  no  doubt, he will  shortly  have  an\r\n\r\nadjournment and a completely empty House to  which\r\n\r\nhe can talk to his heart's content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information,\r\n\r\nSir.

Surely, I am entitled\r\n\r\nto  explain  that simply because we dare  to  make\r\n\r\nsome suggestions, we have been called nags, and we\r\n\r\ndo   resent  such  things.  Apparently,   whenever\r\n\r\nanybody  thinks in a different way from  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister, he is a nag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has caused me great surprise to learn that\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister has changed his opinion of his\r\n\r\nBackbenchers so greatly within the space of a very\r\n\r\nshort  time. He now thanks heaven that he has  not\r\n\r\ngot us instead.

There it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Sir, a short acquaintance, a very short\r\n\r\nacquaintance,  with  Government,  does   seem   to\r\n\r\nindicate that we are apt in many spheres  to  live\r\n\r\non  a somewhat extravagant scale, and we intend to\r\n\r\ntake  action  shortly to bring about a realisation\r\n\r\nby  the various Departments of the important  need\r\n\r\nfor economy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see no more truthful words than these - the\r\n\r\nserious need for economy in all what we do.  I  am\r\n\r\nviewing   with  concern  the  expansion   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments. To a certain  extent,  as\r\n\r\nexplained by the Hon. the Chief Secretary, that is\r\n\r\nnecessary, but we must bear in mind that  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  yet provided for all the social services that\r\n\r\nare  in the mind of the Government today, and only\r\n\r\nyesterday or the day before we were informed  that\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of education alone might be trebled  in\r\n\r\nthe next year or two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I can understand the position of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  at  the  present  moment.   They   are\r\n\r\noverworked  because they are trying to  take  over\r\n\r\nsome new duties which they are not accustomed  to,\r\n\r\nand if it is impossible for the Ministers to carry\r\n\r\non  their  duties,  is  it not  better  to  engage\r\n\r\ntemporary  Secretaries,  men  who  have  been   in\r\n\r\nGovernment  service, versed in the  administration\r\n\r\nof  a  particular Ministry? These posts can always\r\n\r\nbe  scrapped whenever their services are no longer\r\n\r\nrequired, and no further expense will be  incurred\r\n\r\nby the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the debate on the first\r\n\r\nfive  motions took only 25 minutes, but the  sixth\r\n\r\nmotion has taken us nearly two hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has spoken on the various\r\n\r\npoints  raised by the mover and the supporters  of\r\n\r\nthe  motion.

We  will  not  support  the\r\n\r\nmotion.\" Yet he turned round to the mover of  the\r\n\r\nmotion and said, \"But we will not oppose it  too.\"\r\n\r\nThis  brings to my mind the cartoon in  Saturday's\r\n\r\nStraits  Times -  \"The  Tempestuous  Honeymoon\" - the\r\n\r\nhoneymoon of the Chief Minister and the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  since July up  till  the  18th  of\r\n\r\nAugust,  when  he was just being  taken  into  the\r\n\r\nbridal  chamber and, on the threshold,  the  bride\r\n\r\nescaped  and ran into the arms of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon. Now he believes, \"Well, it is better to\r\n\r\nhave  both rooms, if I can.\" So he says,  \"Let  me\r\n\r\nhave a share of that bed and, please,\" to the  new\r\n\r\nbridegroom, \"I want to share your bed too.

We have to feel\r\n\r\nthe  pulse of the people. The people have  elected\r\n\r\nus   into  this  Assembly,  probably  on  our  own\r\n\r\nmanifestoes,  or on our ability to  convince  them\r\n\r\nunder any apple-tree, but it was their opinion  at\r\n\r\nthat  time  that  sent everyone of  us  into  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. However, I am not too sure that when  we\r\n\r\ncome  into  this  Assembly,  we  will  always   be\r\n\r\nexpressing  what the people want us to do,  unless\r\n\r\nyou  are  a  diviner, and, if you want  to  divine\r\n\r\nanything, you have to go out and find out. I  will\r\n\r\nsay  in  any  one  matter where you  need  a  snap\r\n\r\ndecision, we make that decision, but, in a  matter\r\n\r\nwhere it is the talk of the town, you cannot  help\r\n\r\nlistening  to  it.  It is poured  into  your  ears\r\n\r\neverywhere. You say that your opinion, which suits\r\n\r\nyour own purpose, should be called the opinion  of\r\n\r\nthe public. I must differ from that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, when we started this debate, as my\r\n\r\nfriend  has  said, we expected it  to  be  not  as\r\n\r\nstormy  and  not  as  lengthy  as  all  this;  but\r\n\r\nsomebody  must  bring  in some  other  things  not\r\n\r\nconnected with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebate, and talk about tailors making suits  which\r\n\r\nshould  have been discarded, or probably  somebody\r\n\r\nelse cannot wear them.
