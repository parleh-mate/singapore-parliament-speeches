They were the Commonwealth Immigration Bill and  the  Army\r\n\r\nReserve Bill. The debate on the Commonwealth Immigration Bill had proceeded  for\r\n\r\nthree  days  without making any headway. The Army Reserve Bill had been  debated\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntwo  days without similar results. The consequence of it was that the Government\r\n\r\nthen  moved  a  motion to allot a further three days' debate on the Commonwealth\r\n\r\nImmigration Bill and a further two days for the Army Reserve Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the case of the National Referendum Bill, we have had 12 meetings of\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee discussing various amendments which had been put forward by\r\n\r\nboth  sides of the House. Many of these meetings had gone right up to quite late\r\n\r\nin  the evening. Now we are in a Committee of the whole House and this same Bill\r\n\r\nhas  already  seen through four midnight sittings. However, only 11  clauses  to\r\n\r\nwhich amendments have been made have been debated. There are still 13 clauses on\r\n\r\nthe Order Paper to which amendments will be moved and debate on which will still\r\n\r\nhave to take place.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the arguments on the amendments in the National Referendum Bill have not only been adequately aired in Select Committee but also outside this\r\n\r\nHouse  as  well - through  forums organised by Radio Singapore  and  other  bodies\r\n\r\noutside. The notice for the motion which I am moving now was given on Friday,  a\r\n\r\nfew  minutes  before 4 o'clock and I believe that notice was shortly  afterwards\r\n\r\ncirculated  to  Members of the House. Members of the House  had  ample  time  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss among themselves how to allocate their times for debate on the remaining\r\n\r\nclauses  to  which amendments are being moved. All I am asking the House  is  to\r\n\r\nagree  that  the  debate in Committee on the remaining clauses of  the  National\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill be brought to a conclusion on the 5th of July. That  will  give\r\n\r\nthe House another three days of debate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the House to agree that the Third Reading of the Bill be allotted one\r\n\r\nday. The reason is that we do not wish and, in fact, it will be out of order  if\r\n\r\nwe were to allow the Third Reading of the Bill to become a Second Reading of the\r\n\r\nBill.  Arguments which have been put forward during the Second  Reading  of  the\r\n\r\nBill and during Committee will be tediously repeated once more; Members\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwill  agree that one day is quite sufficient for the debate on the Third Reading\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>2.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the analogy of the House of Commons given by the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nis  inappropriate when we direct our minds for a moment to the size of the House\r\n\r\nin  question  and the extent of the business it transacts. If we compare  ours,\r\n\r\nSir, we must recognize that we are not in a similar position as regards the need\r\n\r\nfor economy of time.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of a story of the American who told a visitor, \"Now let us\r\n\r\nchange subways. If we take a bus and take another subway, we will get there  ten\r\n\r\nminutes earlier.\" And the visitor said, \"After having made all that effort, what\r\n\r\nare you going to do with the ten minutes?\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Commons, Sir, has its work to do. This House would be defunct. My\r\n\r\nunderstanding is that we will be, if not defunct, at least in suspension because\r\n\r\nthe  sittings  will be prorogued for this Session. If the Deputy Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsays  they  need  time  for their own work, I must confess,  Sir,  we  have  had\r\n\r\nexamples,  and ample examples, of the capacity of a country to do  without  them\r\n\r\nfor long periods of time when they are elsewhere at public expense. I think that\r\n\r\nfirst ground, Sir, is just a specious excuse.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second ground is that this matter has been debated in Select Committee\r\n\r\nfor  12  days.  To  be  accurate, Sir, seven of those days were  given  over  to\r\n\r\nrepresentations and five for debate on the representations and  the  clauses  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  Then let us not forget that we had to deal with the red  herring  of\r\n\r\nthis  being a general Referendum Bill from the first day to the last  in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee; and now we are trying to tidy up the faux pas presented to us by this\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third reason given by the Deputy Prime Minister is that the arguments\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  the  Referendum  Bill have been enunciated  outside.  Now,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  that is correct. But what has transpired outside is not  in  itself  a\r\n\r\nreason  why  the matter should not be adumbrated in this House. The radio  forum\r\n\r\ncannot replace the Assembly, Sir, It is true, Sir, that through the radio  forum\r\n\r\nperhaps  we  get  to the people directly and with less distortion,  particularly\r\n\r\nwhen  we  recognise  the  fact  that not only has the  Government  sought  these\r\n\r\nmidnight  sittings in order to prevent adequate expression of the views  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  finding their way to the Press but also, Sir - I do not know  if  you  are\r\n\r\nconscious  of  this - that there has been a complete change of  personnel  in  the\r\n\r\nPress  box in so far as the Chinese newspapers are concerned. We no longer  have\r\n\r\nthe same political reporters-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated that the Press box and the Strangers'\r\n\r\nGallery  have nothing at all to do with matters debated in this Assembly.  There\r\n\r\nmust  not  be  any direct reference to anybody in the Gallery, be it  the  Press\r\n\r\nGallery or the Strangers' Gallery.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged for your guidance, Mr Speaker, but perhaps you\r\n\r\nwill permit me to say that there has been a complete change of personnel of  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the Press dealing with political matters and the  context  is\r\n\r\ninteresting,  Mr  Speaker, because until, let us say, yesterday  we  were  not\r\n\r\nunconscious  (even those of us who do not read the vernacular  Press)  that  the\r\n\r\nNanyang Siang Pau, the Sin Chew Jit Poh, and the Utusan Melayu were three papers\r\n\r\nthat  were representing to some extent the Opposition points of view. As I  say,\r\n\r\nmy  understanding is that there has been a change of personnel of two  of  those\r\n\r\nnewspapers, the Nanyang Siang Pau and the Sin Chew Jit Poh.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the fourth reason given was that we must not permit the Third Reading to be a tedious repetition. There is a very delicate balance between the\r\n\r\nneed  to  maintain in this House the constitutional right of Members to  express\r\n\r\ntheir views and the need to protect the Chamber from tedium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think in fairness, Sir, that any of us can complain that in discharging\r\n\r\nyour particular responsibility in that field we have suffered  tedium. Surely  the  Government  can leave it to you, Mr Speaker,  to  prevent  tedious repetition. I would like to say for myself, Sir, that in so far as the Committee\r\n\r\nsitting  up to Thursday night is concerned, I am not complaining that inadequate\r\n\r\ntime  is  given.  I do say I am unhappy at the suggestion of the  guillotine  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of the matter which indirectly affects our future, where the dishonesty\r\n\r\nof  the Government has to he exposed and re-exposed, and where it is hoped  that\r\n\r\nthe  public reaction which comes through as a result of that exposure  may  have\r\n\r\nsome  effect  upon the Government's conduct. But what I am more than  disturbed,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, is that they are limiting the Third Reading itself to one day.  In\r\n\r\neffect,  it may well take more, Sir, if the Second Reading ends before  Thursday\r\n\r\nnight. But the fact is there are two motions which, read together, suggest  that\r\n\r\nthey want to limit the Third Reading to one day. It may well be sufficient. But,\r\n\r\non  the  other hand, this is the point where you gather all the efforts together\r\n\r\nand  you  try and present a coherent picture of how the provisions of this  Bill\r\n\r\nare  going  to work in the context of a merger referendum, and how inappropriate\r\n\r\nit is and how there exists the flexibility for dishonest manoeuvre.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not unreasonable to suppose that there would be several Members on\r\n\r\nboth  sides of the House who would wish to speak at that stage. It may  well  be\r\n\r\nthat  eight  hours  would  be  adequate. But I say that  these  motions  are  un\r\n\r\nnecessary.  There  has been no indication that there has  been  undue  delay  in\r\n\r\ndealing with the clauses so far. The Deputy Prime Minister speaks of numbers. He\r\n\r\nmust  also notice the gravity, apart from clause 29, Sir, which is now the major\r\n\r\nclause  before us - clauses 28 and 29 - I cannot conceive that we should take  very\r\n\r\nlong  with  reference to the other clauses. In fact, Sir,  I  can  conceive  the\r\n\r\npossibility that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  may  well  finish the Bill before Friday night. But I  do  say  that  it  is\r\n\r\nunfortunate  to  approach us on the basis that the Government have  a  right  to\r\n\r\nlimit  the freedom of speech of the Opposition because they do not like what  is\r\n\r\ntaking place, and they are afraid of the effect outside, which seems to be  what\r\n\r\nin  fact is motivating the Government in the context of this particular Bill.  I\r\n\r\nwould  say.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, even now it is not too  late  to  withdraw  this\r\n\r\nmotion,  and if necessary, Mr Speaker, to bring it again on Thursday  when  the\r\n\r\npicture would be clearer.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, in spite of the excuses put up by the Deputy Prime  Minister.\r\n\r\nthere  is no justification whatsoever for the Government to want to put  a  time\r\n\r\nlimit on the debate on the Referendum Bill.

Mr Speaker, we should take into consideration the  fact\r\n\r\nthat we in\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthis Assembly are duty bound to debate all issue which affects the lives of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, but there are other matters which should be looked  after\r\n\r\ntoo.  If we follow the debate which has been carrying on so far, it is really  a\r\n\r\nmatter  for regret, because the standard of our debates has lowered the  dignity\r\n\r\nof  the  House to the level of coffee-shop talk, whereas, in fact,  we  are  the\r\n\r\nelected  representatives of the people entrusted to look after their well-being.\r\n\r\nWhere  do  we stand if our standard of debates has been reduced to that  of  the\r\n\r\ncoffee-shop talk, as I said earlier on? Every speaker who has risen to speak has\r\n\r\nrisen  to speak just for the sake of speaking. So I sincerely hope that although\r\n\r\nwe  have  parliamentary democracy in this Assembly, we should not bring into  it\r\n\r\nthe opinions and views of the people outside and thereby become stooges. For  me\r\n\r\nand  my  colleagues, Mr Speaker, this motion has our support. So we can say  we\r\n\r\nhave   exhausted  all  points,  whether  they  are  the  Government's   or   the\r\n\r\nOpposition's.  They have no new points to bring forth. I hope we  will  preserve\r\n\r\nthe dignity of this House where debates are conducted according to the rules  of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I knew that when I moved this motion I opened\r\n\r\nmyself  to  the  charge that I was trying to gag Members of the Opposition  from\r\n\r\nspeaking. Nonetheless, we have to bear in mind that if the business of the House\r\n\r\nis  to  proceed expeditiously, then it is obvious that Members who wish to speak\r\n\r\nmust bear on the point and not be repetitious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that the House of Commons procedure is not\r\n\r\napplicable to this Assembly. He has forgotten, Mr Speaker, that a large part of\r\n\r\nour  Standing Orders is based on procedure which has been in practice for  years\r\n\r\nand  years in the House of Commons. In fact, I could even inform the House  that\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation Parliament, the guillotine is always applied and that  there\r\n\r\nare  allocated days for discussion on items on the Order Paper. That is the main\r\n\r\nreason   why   business  is  proceeded  with  expeditiously  in  the  Federation\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not as the Member for Thomson has said that it is the P.A.P. that makes\r\n\r\nthe  rules.  The Standing Orders are made by this House. There is  the  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders  Committee drawn from both sides of this House, and we  are  just  moving\r\n\r\nthis motion according to the Standing Orders.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Altogether there will be a total of seven days for debate on the National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill in Committee. Members will also be aware that in Committee stage\r\n\r\nany  Member can stand up again and again to speak. There is no rule debarring  a\r\n\r\nMember from standing up and repeating himself. In fact, during the past few days\r\n\r\nwe  have had a disgusting exhibition of the Barisan Sosialis repeating the  same\r\n\r\nold tune like a gramophone record that has been so scratched that the needle has\r\n\r\nnow  got stuck in the groove. They have no more new tunes to sing. What I  would\r\n\r\nsay to the Barisan Sosialis is that they are trying to filibuster, to delay this\r\n\r\nBill from going through. If we go through the records of the meetings in the Committee  stage, I think - if I am correct - the Member for Anson must have stood  up\r\n\r\nnearly thirty times during the past four days of debate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> They were never irrelevant.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Members of the Barisan Sosialis side stood up more than\r\n\r\nthirty  times also. Nobody has stepped them from speaking. In fact,  the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  the  sitting  has  been extended to midnight is to permit  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition more time to state their case. We give them more time to state  their\r\n\r\ncase,  hut they say we are undemocratic. We allow them to hold meetings outside,\r\n\r\nbut  they say we are undemocratic. Such is the tortuous and crooked thinking  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But finally, Mr Speaker, there must be a balance between the demand for time\r\n\r\nso  that  this House can proceed with its business and the demand for  time  for\r\n\r\ndebate. There must be a balance. We agree to that. If I had sprung\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthis  motion  as a surprise on the House, then I would have been guilty  of  the\r\n\r\ncharge that we are trying to stop Members in this House from speaking. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthis motion provides that the debate on the National Referendum Bill will end at\r\n\r\n12  o'clock  midnight  on Friday. That gives us another  four  days  of  debate,\r\n\r\nincluding  today.  The  Member for Anson himself has  stated  that  it  is  even\r\n\r\npossible  that  the debate on the Bill will come to an end long  before  Friday.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  do not see any reason why he opposes the motion. He  himself  has\r\n\r\nadmitted  that this motion provides that at the latest, the debate should  come\r\n\r\nto a conclusion by Friday at 12 o'clock. He himself has agreed that it might end\r\n\r\nlong  before that time. So I see no reason why he should stand up to oppose this\r\n\r\nmotion, unless, of course, it is merely that because he feels that he is on the\r\n\r\nOpposition side, so he just has to oppose anything that we propose.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am indebted to the Minister, if the Minister had listened,\r\n\r\nSir,  he would not have made it necessary for me to repeat what was said. I said\r\n\r\nthat  it may well be in the natural course of events that the debate would termi\r\n\r\nnate  well before midnight on Friday, that in the circumstances this motion  was\r\n\r\nunnecessary, and that I do not like the approach of the Government whereby  they\r\n\r\narrogate to themselves the right to indulge in a closure motion prematurely  and\r\n\r\nunnecessarily in a matter of such vital importance to the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am obliged to the Member for Anson for his clarification.\r\n\r\nBut I have also cited precedents that took place in the House of Commons. I have\r\n\r\ncited  that only recently in January this year, the House of Commons  imposed  a\r\n\r\nguillotine on the debate in Committee on the Commonwealth Immigration  Bill  and\r\n\r\non  the  Army Reserve Bill, and for the very same reason - that progress  was  not\r\n\r\nbeing made on those two Bills. The Members were being repetitious. You yourself,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, had at one stage during the debate in Committee\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\neven suggested that a closure motion should be made. I think it was on the first\r\n\r\namendment.  I know that Members of the House like to hear themselves heard.  But\r\n\r\nperhaps  they could be also more forbearing to other Members. If there  are  new\r\n\r\npoints  of view being put forward and new arguments which can be advanced,  then\r\n\r\nwe  are  quite prepared to listen to them. But when they become tendentious  and\r\n\r\nrepetitious with abuse creeping in between arguments, I do not think it is  fair\r\n\r\nto  impose  upon Members of this House a recital of what has been  said  before,\r\n\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I point out to Members of the House that in the Committee of\r\n\r\nSupply, the Standing Orders specially provide for allocation of time. There is a\r\n\r\ntime-table  for debate on the items of expenditure, otherwise, Mr Speaker,  you\r\n\r\nand I will not be getting our salaries and neither will Members of this House be\r\n\r\ngetting  their allowances. We could have debated in the Committee of  Supply  on\r\n\r\nand  on  until  we  cover  365 days in the year and we  will  never  come  to  a\r\n\r\nconclusion. It was precisely in order that the business of Supply should come to\r\n\r\na  conclusion that we have Standing Orders which specially provide for  a  time-table.  It  may be that in our present Standing Orders, we do not have  a  time-table in respect of other items of business. But it is fair to the House that we\r\n\r\nshould  also  try  to  be considerate to other Members of  the  House  who  have\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  outside.  Members of the Government  have  their  business  to\r\n\r\nconduct besides attending sittings in this Chamber.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, I really see little objection from the arguments put forward\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Anson or from the Barisan Sosialis as to why we  should  not\r\n\r\nproceed with this motion. I think the most pertinent point that has been made in\r\n\r\nthis  debate  has  come from the Member for Farrer Park who has quite  correctly\r\n\r\npointed  out  that  if  we  were to go on at this rate,  it  would  not  elevate\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, but it would kill parliamentary democracy.  As  he  has\r\n\r\nreplied  to  the  Member  for Thomson, parliamentary  democracy  does  not  mean\r\n\r\npermitting a Member to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncome  back to the Chamber reading scripts prepared by somebody else Outside  and\r\n\r\nthese are very lengthy scripts indeed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

If  they\r\n\r\nwant  to do this without considering any of our amendments, then this referendum\r\n\r\nhas  lost its meaning. At the same time, this referendum is a democratic way  of\r\n\r\ndoing  things.  We all know in our society - that is, one elector, one  vote - many\r\n\r\nunconstitutional things can be done in the name of democracy. We  can  say  that\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. are guilty of this.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was elected as a democratic Party. Today, the referendum is put  forward\r\n\r\nas a democratic measure. But is this a genuine or a\r\n\r\nfalse  democratic  measure that now confronts us? We see  that  there  are  many\r\n\r\nclauses  in  the  Referendum  Bill which are undemocratic.  But  the  democratic\r\n\r\nmeasures  of  the P.A.P. have the support of only 26 elected representatives  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly. Mr Speaker, Sir, some people who have a bigger force ask  those\r\n\r\npeople who have a smaller force to vote for them;\r\n\r\nsuch  a  democracy  is  just like the Lim Yew Hock Government's  democracy.  The\r\n\r\ndemocracy  practised by the P.A.P. nowadays is no more different.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  let  me  say this. The P.A.P. put up their merger proposals and  use  this\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill to force the people to vote for them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me quote the Nanyang Siang Pau of 26th April, 1962, regarding the Prime Minister's radio forum. It was reported in page 5 of the\r\n\r\nlocal  news page. The Prime Minister, replying to a reporter's question  on  merger,  said,  \"At the moment, we are only concerned with an All-Party discussion.\r\n\r\nIf  there are any plans, then the societies can raise such problems and  discuss\r\n\r\nthem.\" This was on merger. The Prime\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nMinister  said  that  this  was  a very good proposition.  Of  course,  all  the\r\n\r\nsocieties  and associations should have an opportunity to raise problems  if  it\r\n\r\nwas necessary, and then they could send their memoranda on the Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what the Prime Minister said seemed very democratic. Many\r\n\r\nsocieties and associations sent in their memoranda on this Referendum Bill.  Now\r\n\r\nbecause time is pressing, I am not going to speak at length on this. I am  going\r\n\r\nto  speak on just a few cultural societies. The memoranda sent in by such bodies\r\n\r\nas the Nanyang University Students' Union, and economic and political societies,\r\n\r\nhave  three  points  which are worth considering. The first point  is  that  the\r\n\r\nundemocratic  provisions, especially clause 29, should be  abolished.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nthere should only be one question posed-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think all Members of the Assembly have received this\r\n\r\nmemorandum.  All  the Member should say, I think, is that the  memorandum  urges\r\n\r\nthis, that and the other, but not to read from the memorandum. I do not think we\r\n\r\nshould be inflicted with that.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  I will not quote it then. I am sure the Ministers  have  received the memorandum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this Referendum Bill, the provision for unmarked votes and blank votes\r\n\r\nwhich  are  deemed to be in favour of the Government is very dangerous.  Let  me\r\n\r\nquote an example. In the past the Lim Yew Hock Government sold Christmas Island.\r\n\r\nIf  Lim  Yew  Hock  had  been as smart as the P.A.P., he would  have  posed  two\r\n\r\nquestions:  \"Do  you want to sell Christmas Island,\" or \"ho  you  want  to  sell\r\n\r\nSingapore?\" Both questions would have been a sell-out. Of course, there would be\r\n\r\npeople who would have neither of these questions and therefore would cast  blank\r\n\r\nvotes.  Lim  Yew  Hock then could have utilised this provision and  would  have\r\n\r\ntaken these votes as in support of the question.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the P.A.P. has shown itself to be undemocratic. The people of Singapore\r\n\r\ndo  not  trust  the Party any more. For instance, the fox, which  is  a  cunning\r\n\r\nanimal, is hated by all its kind and they do not want to befriend him. And  this\r\n\r\nfox  put  on  a sheep's clothing to deceive the other animals, but  he  did  not\r\n\r\nsucceed.  In  the course of the debate over the past few days the  P.A.P. said\r\n\r\nthat  they  wanted to pose two questions to the people for them to  decide.  But\r\n\r\nboth  these questions are in opposition to the wishes and interests of  the  peo\r\n\r\nple.  The people, therefore, might cast blank votes or abstain from voting.  And\r\n\r\nthey  now  say  that such votes are to be taken as votes in favour  of  the  Government. This is not democracy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta, who is the wife of the Minister for Home Affairs, quoted\r\n\r\nan  article in the local news-page of the Nanyang Siang Pau of today's date. She\r\n\r\nquoted:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They have no way out. They have become the compradores of the colonialists.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbr><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, if we were to unite all the people of Singapore and get  them\r\n\r\nto  oppose  the Government's sell-out, then they could accuse us of  such  behaviour.

And so we must all unite together to  oppose  this\r\n\r\nsell-out.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

If you do not sow seeds, you cannot get\r\n\r\npadi. That is why there is a connection. The connection comes here:\r\n\r\nif  there  was no Paper Cmd. 33, there would not be a National Referendum  Bill,\r\n\r\nand so there would not be so much debate now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just mentioned to you what the Member for Delta has\r\n\r\nsaid.  She  has  accused us of this and that. It may be that we  have  political\r\n\r\ndifferences with the Government Benches, but if a fire should break out on their\r\n\r\nside we would carry water over and put out the fire. Therefore, if the basis  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's policy is in the interests of the people, we will support  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the P.A.P. were to introduce measures in the interests of the people, then\r\n\r\nthey should face realities. And if they were democratic, then they should change\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude towards these blank votes. If a voter is very dissatisfied  with\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude, then he might just draw a line across the voting  paper  or  he\r\n\r\nmight  even draw a tortoise on it. This action, therefore, reflects the attitude\r\n\r\nof  the people towards this provision. The Government should face realities  and\r\n\r\nnot   waste  any  time.  They  are  afraid  of  being  exposed.  But  we,  being\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people, struggle for the interests  of  the  people  and\r\n\r\nrelay  the opinions of the people in this House. I believe democracy means  just\r\n\r\nthis. I should emphasise that if the Government were to practise real democracy,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthen  blank  votes  and uncertain votes should be considered void.  If  the  Government insist on such votes as being in favour of merger, then it is not right.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>     [Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): During these last few\r\n\r\ndays  we have been debating the National Referendum Bill, in the course of which\r\n\r\neverybody  can  see clearly that the provisions in the Bill are undemocratic  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  unreasonable, barbaric and dictatorial. The P.A.P. wants to adulterate\r\n\r\nthe  views of the people by means of the passage of this Bill and also by  means\r\n\r\nof carrying out its phoney merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, everybody can see the exposure of the P.A.P.'s undemocratic National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill. The undemocratic provisions have appeared glaringly in the eyes\r\n\r\nof  the  people. After the heated debates, the P.A.P. Government cannot  explain\r\n\r\nand  cannot  advance  any arguments to substantiate their  points.  They  cannot\r\n\r\njustify  themselves,  especially on the clause  which  provides  for  blank  and\r\n\r\nuncertain votes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday in the Assembly the Ministers and Members of the Government were not\r\n\r\nable  to  explain, to substantiate and to justify such undemocratic  provisions.\r\n\r\nNow,  let  me quote what they said. The Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home Affairs said that blank votes belong to the category which support the\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the  Assembly. When people cast blank votes  it  means  that  they\r\n\r\nsupport  the decision of the Assembly. Now that is not very democratic. He  said\r\n\r\nthat  this  was so, but what were the reasons advanced by him? He was unable  to\r\n\r\ngive  any  reasons  to  substantiate his arguments. How could  he  convince  the\r\n\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health and Law said - let me quote his words:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To let the voter choose from two or more questions and if he cannot make up\r\n\r\nhis  mind,  then  he  will be deemed to accept the opinion  of  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly on the matter referred in the referendum. This is not undemocratic.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what were his reasons? He was also unable to give any reason. The\r\n\r\nGovernment are only trying to turn things upside down. When something is  black,\r\n\r\nthey say it is white, and when it is white, they say it is black.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, we all know and all the people of Singapore know that there have never been such provisions in the world which provide that blank votes and\r\n\r\nuncertain  votes  are  to be construed as votes in support of  the  Government's\r\n\r\nphoney merger, because everybody knows that such blank votes and uncertain votes\r\n\r\nshould be construed as void votes or votes not in support of any measure. We all\r\n\r\nknow  that  in democratic countries, when people are faced with two unreasonable\r\n\r\nor  unacceptable questions, the people will have the democratic right to abstain\r\n\r\nfrom voting.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, I believe you also know that there were trade unions, rural organisations, hawkers' organisations and students' associations which gave\r\n\r\ntheir representations to the Select Committee, but their views were not accepted\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P.  Ministers. They also know that in the streets, in  the  coffee-shops,  everywhere  and  at every corner, people have been  talking  about  this\r\n\r\nundemocratic  Bill. They all hate the dictatorship of the P.A.P.  We  also  know\r\n\r\nthat outside this House there are five political Parties - the Workers' Party, the\r\n\r\nUnited People's Party, the Liberal Socialist Party, the Barisan Sosialis and the\r\n\r\nUnited  Democratic  Party.  They form the Council of Joint  Action  against  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  undemocratic National Referendum Bill in order to check  the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nevil actions, to explode the myth of the P.A.P.'s accusation that all those  who\r\n\r\noppose the P.A.P. are Communists or pro-Communists or their stooges, and also to\r\n\r\nprotest  against  the  Government's other acts, such as  pushing  through  their\r\n\r\nNational Referendum Bill and their phoney merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, you will also remember that on the 24th of June, the Workers' Party at an All-Party mass rally at Anson, the Secretary-General of the S.P.A.,\r\n\r\nMr Lim Kim Chuan, talked\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nabout  the  undemocratic ways of the P.A.P. in regard to the National Referendum\r\n\r\nBill  and  about certain undemocratic provisions in the Bill. Mr Lim Kim  Chuan\r\n\r\nsaid that the S.P.A. were not as stinking as the P.A.P. It would appear that  he\r\n\r\nwas also not satisfied with such a provision in the Bill. Those\r\n\r\nS.P.A.  Members in this House - after you have heard the words of your  Secretary-General,  what  reflections  do  you  have on  those  words?  You  have  clearly\r\n\r\nunderstood that this Bill is not democratic. Why then do you keep silent and  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  speak out, or dare to stand up to reflect the  feelings  and  the\r\n\r\nopinions  of  your Party which has expressed its dissatisfaction with  such  pro\r\n\r\nvisions as contained in this Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, since the P.A.P. have said that the White Paper merger is in the best interests of the people, why then do the Government not want to pose only\r\n\r\none  question,  specifically on the merger issue for the people to  decide?  Why\r\n\r\nshould the Government provide such undemocratic provisions here and try to  pose\r\n\r\ntwo  unreasonable questions to let the people make their choice? When the people\r\n\r\ndo not want these two unwanted things, they can only cast blank votes or abstain\r\n\r\nfrom  voting.  Then  the P.A.P. would try to construe such  votes  as  votes  in\r\n\r\nsupport of them, as though they want to win both ways.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the Prime Minister has said that the P.A.P. come from the people\r\n\r\nand  will go back to the people and be with them; but he has now forgotten  such\r\n\r\nwords. Were the P.A.P. not elected by the people in the past to become Ministers\r\n\r\ntoday?  Now they are riding on the heads of the people, doing things  their  own\r\n\r\nway and disregarding the views of the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I will quote the words of the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development. He says there are three factors which go into\r\n\r\nthe  making of laws. First is usage; second is the objective circumstances; and,\r\n\r\nthird, the actual effect. I can explain thus: what is the use of this Bill if it\r\n\r\nis to deceive the people and to pretend democracy? Now what\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nare  the circumstances and situations prevailing now? That means that at present\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. will no longer get the support of the people. They dare not face the\r\n\r\npeople  any  more.  They  can  only  resort to these  undemocratic  and  illegal\r\n\r\nprovisions to suppress the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the first point -what is the effect of this kind of law? It is to adulterate the views of the people in order to force through the P.A.P.'s phoney\r\n\r\nmerger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me quote the Member for Tiong Bahru, who said something\r\n\r\nyesterday. I quote from today's Sin Chew Jit Poh,, page 8, local news. He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The merger of the peoples of the two territories, Singapore and the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, is opposed by them. When the British sometime ago  divided\r\n\r\nus, we all rose against them hut now when the people want to merge, they try  to\r\n\r\noppose  it.  The provision of blank votes is to encourage the people  to  vote.\r\n\r\nThese  people who oppose it can cast votes to show their opposition,  and  those\r\n\r\nwho agree to the question can cast votes in support of it. Is it not democratic?\r\n\r\nThe  success of the merger is the will of the people and the failure to  achieve\r\n\r\nmerger  is  also the will of the people. Do you mean to say that the people  do\r\n\r\nnot know what is right and what is wrong?\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  I  will ask: Do you not allow the people to cast votes against the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper merger proposals? Since he has said so, perhaps he means that  they\r\n\r\nhave the intention to allow the people to do so.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Mammen, on this\r\n\r\nquestion of unmarked and uncertain votes, I think it is necessary to go back  to\r\n\r\nthe history of this clause and the justification for it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, when the Bill was tabled for First Reading, there was no such provision in the Bill.

Therefore, the Second Reading of the Bill was  postponed\r\n\r\nmainly in order to think of ways and means to frustrate this Communist intention\r\n\r\nand  to  ensure  that  the  genuine wishes of the people  are  ascertained.  The\r\n\r\npostponement of the Second Reading of the Bill was also to provide machinery for\r\n\r\nthe referendum petition raised by the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this evil design of the Communists and their stooges in the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  to wreck the merger referendum became as clear as daylight during  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee debate. The Memoranda from the S.A.T.U. group of trade unions,\r\n\r\nOld  Boys'  Associations, Hawkers and Rural organisations  only  confirmed  this\r\n\r\nsinister intention. I shall elaborate on this a bit further.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Barisan Sosialis demanded that only one question can be posed in a\r\n\r\nreferendum.  Now  this was contrary to the pro-Communist unions'  original  line\r\n\r\nthat there should be two questions. Now, the pro-Communists' original stand  was\r\n\r\nthat it would be unfair to put only the White Paper proposals to the people,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbecause  since everybody was in favour of merger, they would naturally vote  for\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper. To be fair, they argued that their stand of full and  complete\r\n\r\nmerger, like Penang and Malacca, should also be put to the people. Soon after it\r\n\r\nwas  decided in Djakarta by the P.K.I. that Malaysia was an imperialist plot  to\r\n\r\nbring  neo-colonialism  to this part of the world. The  only  way  to  frustrate\r\n\r\nMalaysia in Singapore was to wreck the merger. Thereafter, the original line  of\r\n\r\ntwo  questions, \"Do you want the White Paper merger\" or \"Do you  want  full  and\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger like Penang and Malacca\" was switched in favour of one question\r\n\r\non the White Paper only. The purpose of a national referendum-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of clarification.

He has got the Hansards up till this morning's. Can he indicate support\r\n\r\nfor that statement?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I said that this was the original line of the pro-Communist\r\n\r\nunions.

Member:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> When it was demonstrated beyond all doubt in the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  by  means  of illustrations and actual examples that  more  than  one\r\n\r\nquestion  in  the  form  of  alternative choice is sometimes  necessary  if  the\r\n\r\nmajority  views of the people are to be ascertained, the Barisan  Sosiahis  then\r\n\r\nstated  that  there  must be the right to say \"No\" to any  number  of  questions\r\n\r\nposed.  Their purpose is obvious. The Barisan Sosialis hope thereby  they  could\r\n\r\ninstigate the people by means of malicious rumours and falsehoods and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nfear  of  intimidation  to  vote  \"No\"  to  all  the  questions  posed,  thereby\r\n\r\nfrustrating the object of the referendum. To make sure that they would  succeed,\r\n\r\nthey  demanded  the unprecedented right to destroy ballot papers  legally.  They\r\n\r\nthought  that  in securing this right the Communists and their  stooges  in  the\r\n\r\nunions  could  mount  a campaign by exploiting communal fears  and  chauvinistic\r\n\r\nsentiments  to  get  innocent  people  to  protest  against  the  referendum  by\r\n\r\ndestroying  and defacing ballot papers. Not satisfied with this, to  make  their\r\n\r\nsuccess  doubly sure, they asked that the people should be able  to  cast  blank\r\n\r\nvotes so that the true wishes of the people cannot be ascertained.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, having understood what the pro-Communists in the Barisan Sosialis were up\r\n\r\nto,  it  is  only right and proper for a responsible Government to take  counter\r\n\r\nmeasures to frustrate this Communist attempt to wreck the referendum. Therefore,\r\n\r\non  the  Second Reading of the Bill, an amendment was moved to clause  29,  sub-clause (1) which reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any person whose ballot paper is unmarked or is uncertain shall he deemed to\r\n\r\nbe  a person who accepts or is willing to accept the decision of the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly on the matter referred for the referendum.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why should the Barisan Sosialis want the right to organise a campaign to\r\n\r\ninstigate  the voters into casting blank votes? One has always to remember  that\r\n\r\nin  any  discussion on matters that affect the future of the people, one  should\r\n\r\nnot  lose  sight of the political reality. It is useless to seek an  ideal  that\r\n\r\nexists  only  in  fantasy  or  in the mind of the  Member  for  Anson.  In  this\r\n\r\nparticular issue of merger, the basic factor which everyone must not lose  sight\r\n\r\nof  in  the heat of the argument is that no one in the Opposition, least of  all\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis, is against merger, or at least that  is  what  they  say\r\n\r\npublicly. All agree that there should be merger between Singapore and  the  Federation,  but what the Barisan Sosialis are against is that the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhave  not  gone  far enough to demand for a complete merger, so  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould become a constituent State like Penang or Malacca.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, since all are agreed that there should be merger, the difference is in\r\n\r\nthe mode and manner of effecting such a merger. Obviously, the best and only way\r\n\r\nto  ascertain the majority view of the people is to put to them the  alternative\r\n\r\nas in the case of the Cameroons.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to say \"No\" is inherent in the choice that one makes. If the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and their supporters think that the White Paper is unacceptable,  what\r\n\r\nthey need do is to vote for their brand of merger, which means \"No\" to the White\r\n\r\nPaper.  There is no need, Mr Mammen, to cast blank votes. The Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  claimed again and again that they represent the people of Singapore.  Now,\r\n\r\nif  the  Barisan Sosialis believe that they have the full support of the people,\r\n\r\nnot  just their support on paper, then why not ask the people to vote for  their\r\n\r\nproposition, and secure their objective? Why ask the people to cast blank votes?\r\n\r\nAre  they  not so sure of the support of the people, 38 trade unions  and  rural\r\n\r\norganisations  notwithstanding? If the pro-Communists and the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  the full support of the people, as they claim, why should there be 40  per\r\n\r\ncent blank votes in the example given by the Member for Thomson yesterday? Those\r\n\r\n40  per  cent  blank votes should have gone to the Barisan Sosialis proposition.\r\n\r\nThe  question of 40 per cent blank votes should not have arisen at all. The acts\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  Sosialis lead one to the logical conclusion that  the  pro-Communists in the Barisan Sosialis, in fact, do not want merger in any form,  other\r\n\r\nthan merger with Indonesia or when perhaps there is a Communist or pro-Communist\r\n\r\nGovernment in the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, having made the first error of declaring for full and complete merger\r\n\r\nlike  Penang or Malacca, the Barisan Sosialis could not publicly repudiate their\r\n\r\nstand; and even if they want to, they dare not for they realise that they cannot\r\n\r\nstem  the tide of history and go against the wishes of the people. However, they\r\n\r\ndid not then expect the Government to take their proposition seriously, and that\r\n\r\nthe Federation, in\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nany  case,  would not accept it.

That is why they want  to  have\r\n\r\nthis right to cast blank votes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker Sir, the reunification of Singapore and the Federation has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  long  cherished aspiration of all nationalist and progressive  organisa\r\n\r\ntions  in  Malaya, ever since the British colonialists divided  the  country  in\r\n\r\n1946.  Since  that time, the merger of the two territories has never  been  lost\r\n\r\nsight of by all anti-colonialists in their fight against colonial rule. However,\r\n\r\nwhen merger is around the corner, and no longer just wishful thinking, the self-styled  anti-colonial Barisan Sosialis have done a somersault and  become  anti-merger.  They  do  not  wish to be independent by merging with  the  Federation.\r\n\r\nInstead,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthey prefer to retain colonial rule by their demand for internal self-government\r\n\r\nunder  the British. They would rather our country and our people remain divided.\r\n\r\nIn perpetuating the division of our country and our people and in prolonging the\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule, the barisan Sosialis and their Communist masters are  the  real\r\n\r\nenemies  of  the people. Mr Speaker, Sir, the anti-merger stand  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis as evidenced by their strenuous effort to wriggle out of  their\r\n\r\ncomplete merger stand is understandable because it is an open front organisation\r\n\r\nthrough  which the Communists seek to expand their influence and to  co-ordinate\r\n\r\ntheir  other  front organisations and also to open a new front on the  political\r\n\r\nplane.  No one therefore need be surprised if he reads in the newspaper  that  a\r\n\r\nJoint  Action Committee of the Barisan Sosialis and the pro-colonial  capitalist\r\n\r\nParty,  the  Liberal Socialists, has been formed. The history and experience  of\r\n\r\nCommunist parties elsewhere have shown that the Communists are prepared  at  any\r\n\r\ntime,  if  it is in their ultimate interest, to sacrifice their lofty principles\r\n\r\nand join forces with the most reactionary of political forces. No doubt, the pro-Communists in the Barisan Sosialis are well trained in the Communist tactics  of\r\n\r\nthe  united  front and have sacrificed whatever socialist principles  that  they\r\n\r\nprofessed  publicly  to  join forces with a Party that is  noted  for  its  pro-colonial,  pro-capitalist  and reactionary interests.  It  has  been  said,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  by the Barisan Sosialis that we have distorted  their  stand  on\r\n\r\nmerger,  that  the  Penang and Malacca type of merger was a  concoction  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Now, it is an honourable practice of the Communists to tell a bare-faced\r\n\r\nlie  if they are cornered. Similarly, I see this same tactic being practised  to\r\n\r\nits  perfection by the Barisan Sosialis. I do not intend to go into  details  on\r\n\r\nthis.  What  the Barisan Sosialis stand on merger is will be the  subject  of  a\r\n\r\ndebate  later on. But it is necessary in discussing this amendment to clause  29\r\n\r\nto touch briefly on this point because their argument is that the people will be\r\n\r\ngiven two unacceptable alternatives and one of the unacceptable alternatives  is\r\n\r\nour interpretation of what the Barisan Sosialis stand on merger was. Now, I\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhave  here  with  me a copy of the manifesto of the Barisan Sosialis  dated  3rd\r\n\r\nSeptember,  1961, which states their stand on merger. I will quote the  relevant\r\n\r\nportion:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Barisan Sosialis stand for a united\r\n\r\nMalayan  State  comprising  the  territories now  known  as  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya.

Then they went on to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The way ahead therefore for a real reunification of our people and our\r\n\r\ncountry is in one of two directions: (a) an immediate, full and complete  merger\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore  joining the Federation as a constituent State  like  Penang  or\r\n\r\nMalacca,'\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of\r\n\r\norder, Sir, I would like him to quote the whole text, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I  still\r\n\r\nmaintain that it is not a distortion of what was stated in their manifesto.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, there was no mention whatsoever of automatic citizenship  rights.\r\n\r\nIt  is a categorical statement of the Barisan Sosialis stand on merger announced\r\n\r\npublicly  to  the people and published in the newspapers as well. Subsequent  to\r\n\r\nthis, they have also written to the Deputy Prime Minister on similar lines; also\r\n\r\nin  a  radio  forum  attended by the Member for Queenstown.  Perhaps  these  are\r\n\r\nembarrassing statements to be reminded of. However, we have no doubt  that  they\r\n\r\nmade their stand on merger with all sincerity at that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fundamental democratic right to vote is safeguarded in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. No one is deprived of this right, be he a Barisan Sosialis,  a  Workers'  Party, or a United People's Party member or even a Communist. Now  no  one\r\n\r\nbelieves that this fundamental democratic right to a secret vote is practised in\r\n\r\na  fascist  country. Is this fundamental democratic right available in Communist\r\n\r\ncountries  which  no  doubt the Barisan Sosialis regard as  democratic?

All the others who do not share the ideology of the Communists or refuse\r\n\r\nto  accept  the  Communist Party leadership are classified  as  enemies  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  as  enemies  of  the people they have no  rights  whatsoever.  All\r\n\r\nfundamental human rights, including the right to vote, are deprived from the so-called  enemies of the people. And judged by the standards set in  the  People's\r\n\r\nDemocracy, the 13 Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen would be classified as enemies  of\r\n\r\nthe  people. Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen are genuinely\r\n\r\ninterested in the fundamental democratic right of the people may I suggest  that\r\n\r\nthey attempt it in the People's Democracy? In the People's Democracy, even where\r\n\r\nelections  are held and the people are allowed to vote, they can only vote  from\r\n\r\nan  approved  list of candidates, all belonging to the same Party.

A  citizen is entitled to say \"Yes\" or \"No\"  to  any  policy  or\r\n\r\nmeasure  to  be  adopted by the Government.

We know very well that when the people are faced  with  no\r\n\r\nchoice  but  to  say \"No\", then they will abstain. Everybody agrees  that  in  a\r\n\r\nnormal general election or by-election, there will not be many abstaining votes.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Government now has realised this and is worried if there will  be\r\n\r\na  lot  of  abstention votes. It also realises that blank votes  and  abstention\r\n\r\nvotes  will mean a protest by the people, and it is their only way of expressing\r\n\r\ntheir dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the new clause to be proposed by the Minister for Home Affairs, we see\r\n\r\nthat  this  National Referendum Bill will be repealed after the holding  of  the\r\n\r\nnational referendum on merger. From this we can see that the Government realises\r\n\r\nthat.  The  present National Referendum Bill, especially the provision regarding\r\n\r\nthe blank votes, is contrary to normal reason and decency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, normally we should follow common sense whenever we want to\r\n\r\ndo  a  thing.  However,  on  this grave question which  affects  the  future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, we see that the Government have made use of certain measure  which\r\n\r\nare  contrary  to common sense and decency. How can this behaviour  bring  about\r\n\r\ngood results?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational  Development  mentioned that when we make a law  we  should  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration three factors. Firstly, when a law is drafted we must consider the\r\n\r\nuses  and  functions of the law. Secondly, the making of that law should  be  in\r\n\r\nkeeping with the circumstances and situation prevailing. Thirdly, the making  of\r\n\r\nthat  law  should have regard to this - that is, what result will it achieve?  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I wish to point out to you that the P.A.P. has this  purpose  in\r\n\r\nmind when introducing\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthis  National Referendum Bill, especially clause 5 and clause 29 which  we  are\r\n\r\ndebating  now.  According  to the speeches made by  the  P.A.P.  Ministers,  the\r\n\r\npurpose  is to make use of this Bill to fix the Barisan Sosialis. From  this  we\r\n\r\ncan see that the method of the P.A.P. in dealing with the question of merger  is\r\n\r\nnot in accordance with the interests of the broad masses. It is solely motivated\r\n\r\nby the desire to deal a blow at their political opponents.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the present circumstances under which this Bill is brought up, we\r\n\r\nall  know what are the circumstances and situation. The situation is that people\r\n\r\nfrom  various  strata  of society and people who are holding  various  political\r\n\r\nviews  are  all opposed to the P.A.P. Government. Under these circumstances,  in\r\n\r\ndrafting this National Referendum Bill which embodies the provision about  blank\r\n\r\nvotes - now, what will be the result of the introduction of this Bill? I think not\r\n\r\nonly  can  they not appease the hatred and hostility of the people, but  it  may\r\n\r\nanger them the more against the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. want to fix the Barisan Sosialis and they try to\r\n\r\nuse all sorts of means, even to sacrificing the rights of the people outside the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, in order just to achieve this purpose. I would like  to  tell\r\n\r\nthem  that the result of their effort will result in more people supporting  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis.  It will result in more people opposing  the  Government  and\r\n\r\nhating  the  Government,  because the Government are going  to  sacrifice  their\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can see that if the country is run on this basis, any government will not last for long.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister in his speech gave\r\n\r\ncertain  examples which are illogical and inappropriate. To compare  the  Government posing several questions to parents asking their children whether they want\r\n\r\nto eat meat or whether they want to eat fish is not proper. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink  you  will  know  that a wise parent will know that under  certain  circumstances he can satisfy the request of his children. He can give them vegetables\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nin  the morning and in the afternoon give them meat and at night give them fish.\r\n\r\nBut  under  the present constitutional arrangements, can we carry out the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  proposals  today;  and tomorrow can we carry out  the  confederation  proposals;  and  the day after tomorrow can we carry out the White Paper  proposals\r\n\r\nagain? Then, after that, complete merger? Can we do that?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta gave some examples which are not appropriate. She said\r\n\r\nthe  Government asked the people to decide certain questions, which is just like\r\n\r\na  maiden falling in love with two men. She said that under these circumstances,\r\n\r\none  man  is glamorous and the other is more suitable and so she cannot make  up\r\n\r\nher  mind  which one to accept. Therefore, she leaves it to her parents  or  her\r\n\r\ngrand-parents to decide. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether her  experience\r\n\r\nis  like  this.  But  to  compare  merger to this  sort  of  affair  is  totally\r\n\r\ninappropriate.  Because  I  remember the original  Women's  Charter  Bill  which\r\n\r\nstresses that before marriage the couple must be in a healthy condition and they\r\n\r\nshould  have  a  medical certificate from a doctor before they can  be  married.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in the examples given by the Member for Delta, if the maiden  cannot\r\n\r\nmake  up  her  mind, she should not consult her mother or her  grandmother.  She\r\n\r\nshould consult a doctor to see which one is stronger and more healthy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for Home Affairs has accused us by saying that there is no question of citizenship or question of equality in our\r\n\r\nmerger  stand.  He has also quoted our Party's manifesto. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  remind  him  and  other  Government Ministers  that  this  manifesto  was\r\n\r\npublished on the 3rd September, 1961, and before this, that is, on 28th  August,\r\n\r\n1961,  a  few days before the publication of this manifesto, we had published  a\r\n\r\nstatement on our stand on merger which clearly pointed out the question of  automatic  citizenship and the question of proportionate representation  in  the  Federal  Parliament. This article was quoted by me when I spoke a  few  days  ago.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when the Government said that we did not demand equal citizenship, it\r\n\r\nis not correct to say so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs a while ago also mentioned the\r\n\r\nfact  that we formed a Joint Action Council with the other political Parties.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  remind the Government that before the 26th of July,  1961,  the\r\n\r\nfounder of the Barisan Sosialis published a statement, and in it we pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat the stand of the new Party is as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'First, we should govern our country in consultation with the people and not\r\n\r\nthrough order and command. Second, we should restore the basic democratic rights\r\n\r\nof the people. Third, in the future constitutional talks we should safeguard the\r\n\r\ninterests of the various sections of the community.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One and a half months after that, on 17th September, 1961, at the inaugural\r\n\r\nmeeting of the Barisan Sosialis, our Secretary-General, in his speech, also gave\r\n\r\nthe  same  view, that on the question of reunification we have to  shoulder  our\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  and  these responsibilities are not a  question  of  political\r\n\r\nissues but are a matter of national importance. Therefore, the various political\r\n\r\nParties,  the mass organizations and other shades of public opinion should  come\r\n\r\nto an understanding on this question of national importance.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to remind the P.A.P. Government that they should\r\n\r\nrealise  why,  before  they formed the government, when they  were  a  minor  Opposition  Party  in this House, the British had constitutional  talks  with  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.  They also advocated that the views of the  Opposition  Parties\r\n\r\nshould be respected in the Legislative Assembly, because the British people, who\r\n\r\nare  clever  people,  know that any Opposition Party might one  day  become  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of tomorrow. If they had a talk with the present Government  without\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition Parties and when an Opposition Party was voted into power by the\r\n\r\npeople,  the previous constitutional arrangements would have to be reviewed  and\r\n\r\naltered.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On questions of grave importance it is important that we should get the unanimous views of the people. But the merger proposals as outlined in the White\r\n\r\nPaper will not bring about harmony\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nand  unity  among the various races in Malaya. I hope the P.A.P.  Ministers\r\n\r\nwill soberly and calmly consider the example of the United Arab Republic. In the\r\n\r\nUnited  Arab  Republic the merger conditions were not as unreasonable  as  ours.\r\n\r\nHowever, eventually Syria had to part from Egypt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government Ministers have told us that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis will be finished when this National Referendum Bill has been passed and\r\n\r\nafter  merger  takes place. They also stress that the provision regarding  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  which allow people to accept but not to reject is intended to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthe Communists. I want to remind them that during the colonial era the Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations  were  also intended to deal with the Communists. However,  we  have\r\n\r\nseen  that  the P.A.P., which advocated the repeal of the Emergency Regulations,\r\n\r\nwere  returned  by  the people and they have now resorted to the  same  tactics.\r\n\r\nToday they also say they want to make use of these provisions of the P.P.S.O. to\r\n\r\ndeal with the Communists. But will the Barisan Sosialis be finished? I think the\r\n\r\ngoverning  Party's effort will prove to be futile. I believe that  even  if  the\r\n\r\ndeceptive merger proposals are carried out, if in future any Party advocates the\r\n\r\nabolition  of  this merger, this Party will get the support of the  people,  and\r\n\r\nwill  be  returned to power. They will become the Government and  the  objective\r\n\r\nconditions  will be such. Although we in the Barisan Sosialis are  facing  great\r\n\r\npressure  from  the  Government which have adopted  all  sorts  of  measures  to\r\n\r\nsuppress  us,  yet we are confident of our future. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  for  regret  that the Prime Minister is not here. However,  I  hope  his\r\n\r\ncolleagues  will convey my message to him. If the P.A.P. Government introduce  a\r\n\r\nfair  and  reasonable National Referendum Bill to ascertain the  wishes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople and allow them to say `yes' or 'no' to the merger proposals, and when the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister resigns and he meets the ordinary people on the road, they  will\r\n\r\ngreet  him,  \"How  are you, Mr Lee?\" But if he is trying  to  make  use  of  so\r\n\r\narbitrary a method to carry out his measures, then when he resigns and he is out\r\n\r\nof office and he meets the people, the people will heap abuses on him. The\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nPrime  Minister is a bright student in the study of law. His tactics  of  ruling\r\n\r\nare  based  on legal juggling. For example, he tries to equate citizenship  with\r\n\r\nnationality  and  says that the Penang and Malacca type of merger  will  deprive\r\n\r\nhalf  of  our population of their citizenship rights under the present  National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill. This all goes to show that the Prime Minister carries  out  his\r\n\r\nrule  depending on his legal juggling. Yesterday I told him that he  should  not\r\n\r\nuse laws to deceive or bully the people and the Opposition. There is one Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying, \"Those who can climb mountains will fall to death and those who can swim\r\n\r\nwell  will  also be drowned finally.\" Therefore, I hope that our Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nwho  is so well versed in law, should not bury his own future with his legal  ingenuity.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis contend that in\r\n\r\nopposing  clause  29 they are acting in the highest interest of democracy.  They\r\n\r\nsay it is a fundamental and inalienable human right to say no, and they say this\r\n\r\nbasic right has been withdrawn by clause 29. Sir, are they as democratic as they\r\n\r\npretend  to be? Only the most gullible political innocents will take the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis'  statements at their face value. I want to go into some  details  into\r\n\r\nthe real nature of the Barisan Sosialis stand on blank votes. To do this I shall\r\n\r\nhave  to  refer  to the views which the other Communist open front organisations\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to the Select Committee. The organisations in question are the  group\r\n\r\nof 40 Old Boys' Associations, a group of\r\n\r\n38  trade  unions and a group of the Rural Residents, the Country  People's  and\r\n\r\nHawkers'  Associations. On the question of blank votes, these three bodies  play\r\n\r\nmuch  the  same  tune. It is the same as having three separate orchestras,  each\r\n\r\nresponding  to  the direction of one maestro. The Select Committee  had  the  ad\r\n\r\nvantage  of examining under oath witnesses from the trade unIons and  the  Rural\r\n\r\nand Hawkers' Associations.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Not on oath.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your\r\n\r\npardon,  not on oath. The Old Boys' Associations displayed a degree of  prudence\r\n\r\nnot found in the other two groups, and stated that they did not wish to present\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthemselves  before the Committee. Hence, they escaped the  searching  examination  in Select Committee which brought to light the dishonest motive  behind\r\n\r\nthe  representations of the other two groups. On 24th April,  1962,  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  examined representatives of the Rural and Hawkers' Associations,  and\r\n\r\non the 27th of April the trade union representatives gave their evidence. Before\r\n\r\nI proceed to give the Assembly an account of the examination of witnesses in the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee, I should first outline the common stand of blank votes  which\r\n\r\nthese  three groups of Communist front organisations took. The objection to  the\r\n\r\nblank  votes must be related to two important points which they raised in  their\r\n\r\nmemoranda to the Select Committee. First, they wanted the referendum to  contain\r\n\r\nonly  one question with a 'yes' or 'no' answer. This, of course, is in line with\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis' amendment to clause 5 which was debated and defeated  in\r\n\r\nthe House last week. Now, the second point is that even with a 'yes' or 'no' one\r\n\r\nquestion  type of referendum, they said that the referendum should be considered\r\n\r\ncarried  only if a certain minimum percentage of affirmative votes is cast.  The\r\n\r\nRural  and Hawkers' Associations placed this minimum level at sixty per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  electorate. I repeat, Sir, sixty per cent of the electorate, and not  sixty\r\n\r\nper cent of the total votes cast. This means, in effect, that the votes are dead\r\n\r\nmen - there are some 8,000 of them on the electoral register. Those who  are  away\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore  on Polling Day, their votes will be counted as  anti-merger.  I\r\n\r\nwould  have  thought that that in itself is sufficient to expose  the  nefarious\r\n\r\nintentions  of  the  gentlemen  and  to disqualify  them  immediately  from  any\r\n\r\nhypocritical statement made on behalf of the democratic system. Now,  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  wanted  a  minimum of 60 per cent affirmative votes of the  total  votes\r\n\r\ncast; in other words, they are prepared to forgo the votes of dead men.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Rural Residents and Hawkers' representatives claim in all innocence\r\n\r\nthat  they want blank votes to mean that those who cast them are neutral in  respect of the proposition put in the referendum. May I quote from column 163\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nof  the  Minutes of Evidence and this is what the representatives said [L.A. of\r\n\r\n1962];\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If I am clear about the issue, of course, I can express my opinion direct by\r\n\r\nvoting  on  it  \"yes\" or \"no\". But if I am not clear about the  question  posed,\r\n\r\nthen,  of  course, there should be another way out for me, by letting me  become\r\n\r\nneutral in respect of this question before me. What I mean is this. There should\r\n\r\nbe an opportunity for expression by those who are in favour of certain questions\r\n\r\nand those who are against certain questions put to them. There should also be an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for the neutrals to express their opinions to show  that  they  are\r\n\r\nneutrals in respect of the questions put to them. If the proposed amendment were\r\n\r\nto be incorporated and become law, then it means in the world there would not be\r\n\r\nneutral countries and the people would he deprived of their opportunities.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, you will recollect that it was put to these gentlemen that if they\r\n\r\nwanted  a minimum of sixty per cent affirmative votes for the referendum  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried,  then  it  automatically followed that blank votes and  negative  votes\r\n\r\nwould  be  excluded from this sixty per cent. In other words,  blank  votes  for\r\n\r\npractical  purposes are counted as negative votes. To take a simple example,  if\r\n\r\nfifty-five  per cent voted yes, the referendum will not be carried and  it  does\r\n\r\nnot  matter whether the other forty-five per cent all voted no or all cast blank\r\n\r\nvotes  or  some voted no or some cast blank votes. This proposition was  put  to\r\n\r\nthem  and  explained by you, Mr Speaker, in your capacity as  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nSelect   Committee.  They  were  provided  with  pencils  and  paper;   numerous\r\n\r\narithmetical  examples were set out. There was much cogitation and wrinkling  of\r\n\r\nbrows  but  in  the end neither the country bumpkins nor the so-called  hawkers'\r\n\r\nrepresentatives could grasp this elementary proposition. When  it  came  to  the\r\n\r\nturn  of  the trade unions, we witnessed a similar debacle. May I refer  you  to\r\n\r\nQuestions  Nos. 757 to 761, column 242 of the Minutes of Evidence? I  asked  the\r\n\r\ntrade union representatives as follows:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They [that is, the trade unions] said just now that the blank votes,\r\n\r\nuncertain  votes, are not considered as yes or no, is that true? Do they  affirm\r\n\r\nthat?'\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Tan Teck Wah on behalf of the unions answered yes. I then asked:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They also said that the blank votes or undecided votes should not be\r\n\r\nconsidered as being in support of the proposition, is that true?'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>He again said yes. I then asked:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Do they also not say that the blank votes or undecided votes should not be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as opposing the proposition? - Yes. They should not be construed  as\r\n\r\nopposing a certain proposition.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Then I asked:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Therefore, in the calculation of the results of the referendum, blank votes\r\n\r\nshould not be counted together with the \"noes\", is that right? - (All witnesses)\r\n\r\nYes.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Then I asked:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Now, under the 60 per cent affirmative requirement, does it not follow that\r\n\r\nblank  votes  and unmarked votes would be considered together with the  negative\r\n\r\nvotes?-\r\n\r\n(Mr Tan Teck Wah) No.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And  so  the Select Committee went into further arithmetic and finally convinced\r\n\r\nthe  trade unionists in the end that under any requirement of a minimum  percent\r\n\r\nage  of  affirmative votes - whether it is 60 per cent or 51 per  cent  or  any\r\n\r\nother  percentage - the blank votes count as negative votes, and they agreed  with\r\n\r\nthis proposition.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Question No. 767 of the Minutes of Evidence you asked, Sir:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The neutral votes are out completely? - (All witnesses) Yes.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  towards  the  end of the examination of these witnesses,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  gave  yet another example. He said, suppose out of  100,000  voters,\r\n\r\n50,000  voters  said yes, 10,000 voters said no and 40,000 voters abstained,  he\r\n\r\npointed  out  that according to what they agreed, the referendum would  then  be\r\n\r\ncarried.  Now, the thought of the referendum being successful was too  much  for\r\n\r\nthe  trade unionists and they immediately went back to their original stand  and\r\n\r\nmaintained  that  blank votes should be counted with negative votes.  This  drew\r\n\r\nupon  them a severe castigation from the Member for Anson and he said at  column\r\n\r\n265:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Forgive me, Sir, I must put it with respect; must be quite clear myself. Do\r\n\r\nthe witnesses appreciate then that they are completely contrary to the logic  of\r\n\r\nthe  position that they took of the principle that blank votes, undecided votes,\r\n\r\nambiguous votes, should not be counted \"aye\" and should not be counted\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\"nay\" - they said that.

I do not know why the Minister for Law excites interjections when he ought not to. This is not the time. We have not got to that\r\n\r\nheat  yet. I think the Minister for Finance used quite a parliamentary word when\r\n\r\nhe said that the Member for Anson is illustrious.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That is quite appropriate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir, I hope what I said is sinking into the mind of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Nee  Soon and that he will before long realise  what  utterly\r\n\r\nfoolish  things he said yesterday. Sir, what conclusion can we draw  from  this?\r\n\r\nFirst,  all this talk about neutrality, the right to abstain, is sheer  eye-wash\r\n\r\nand hypocrisy. What the Barisan Sosialis want is to defeat the referendum at all\r\n\r\ncosts.  They are prepared to go to the extent that blank votes should be counted\r\n\r\nas  anti-merger  votes.  So you see that all this pretence  of  defending  human\r\n\r\nrights, this appeal to the human conscience and to democratic principles  is  so\r\n\r\nmuch  humbug.  The  real purpose is to frustrate merger and they  will  stop  at\r\n\r\nnothing to achieve their ends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the second significant point is that they openly envisage the possibility\r\n\r\nof  large  numbers  of  people  casting blank  votes,  even  in  a  one-question\r\n\r\nreferendum with a yes or no answer. The estimate of 40 per cent blank votes  was\r\n\r\ndecided by the Member for Queenstown. What does all this prove? It proves beyond\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nany  shadow of doubt their evil intentions. The Member is not following me in  a\r\n\r\nsingle  sense;  I do not think I want to waste the time of the House  to  assist\r\n\r\npeople who have been inattentive. Now, in normal elections, blank votes will not\r\n\r\namount  to  .01 per cent. Why then this sudden concern for such a tiny minority?\r\n\r\nThe  answer, of course, is that the Barisan Sosialis have every intention to jam\r\n\r\nthe  referendum process by deceiving and confusing the people into casting blank\r\n\r\nvotes  which  they claim are votes for them. So the Barisan Sosialis  are  quite\r\n\r\nhappy  to  \"hijack\", to use their own word, and grab blank votes for  their  own\r\n\r\ncause  and  they do so without feeling any moral indignation about the wrongness\r\n\r\nof  this.  They  want to deny on moral principles others from  doing  what  they\r\n\r\nthemselves  wish  to do. So all their objections on grounds of propriety,  moral\r\n\r\nprinciples, democratic procedure, in so far as they are advanced by the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis - the  Government is completely and morally justified in rejecting  their\r\n\r\nsubmissions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in the course of the debate, the Barisan Sosialis attempted certain\r\n\r\nintellectual  justification of their proposals, but on  the  intellectual  plane\r\n\r\ntheir  case  is  hardly any better. Firstly, they object to  clause  29  on  two\r\n\r\ngrounds.  They say that this clause denies the citizens the freedom  to  choose.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  they  say that the choices to be offered in the referendum  would  be\r\n\r\nunacceptable alternatives. Now, Sir, let us examine these two arguments closely.\r\n\r\nFirst  on  the  freedom to choose, they not only complain that  the  freedom  of\r\n\r\nchoice is seriously restricted, but they go further and say that the fundamental\r\n\r\nhuman  right to say no has been taken away from our citizens. Sir, this  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time  that  I have heard that there is in human affairs  any  fundamental\r\n\r\nhuman  right to say no, and I find this constant harping on the right to say  no\r\n\r\nboth  fallacious in reasoning and dishonest in presentation. From this  repeated\r\n\r\nassertion  of  the so-called right to say no, one would think that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis are composed of bashful virgins in the act of being seduced and nothing\r\n\r\ncan be more absurd than this proposition. When they talk of the right to say no,\r\n\r\nthey mean they want freedom for themselves to prevent merger at any\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncost.  Nor  are  they on firmer when they base their argument  more  general\r\n\r\nprinciple of the right to freedom of choice.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we have heard political dissertations of freedom of thought, freedom\r\n\r\nof  speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of the Press. Now, a new  freedom\r\n\r\nis  being  conjured up - freedom of choice. Let us examine  what  these  words\r\n\r\nmean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of choice in the literature is a concept which originated in the\r\n\r\nlaissez-faire  economic theories of the Victorian Age.  It  is  in  fact  the\r\n\r\ncentral  dogma of the ideology of capitalism. How strange it is to find the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson whose admiration is for a regimented form of society  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  the company of the great Victorian exponents of free enterprise,  for\r\n\r\nfree  choice  is at the root of the free enterprise system.  It  means the\r\n\r\nfreedom  to buy the goods with the money you have, freedom to buy and  choose\r\n\r\nwithout  Government interference - without a Government system  for  rationing.\r\n\r\nIt  means the freedom to choose your work and not to be allotted your work by\r\n\r\nsome  central  authority. It also means, for the boss, freedom  to  hire  and\r\n\r\nfire  his workers. This is the real meaning of the freedom of choice in  the\r\n\r\nliterature\r\n\r\nof economics.  But  even  in the realm of economic theory  whence  this  concept\r\n\r\narose,  freedom  of choice is limited by certain objective factors.  A  man's\r\n\r\nfreedom  to choose what he wishes to buy is limited in the first instance  by\r\n\r\nthe  goods that are available in the market and at second remove by what  his\r\n\r\nincome is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are all sorts of things in the market in Singapore, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, Rolls Royces or Daimlers, and you may say that every Member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly has the freedom to buy a $40,000 Rolls Royce. But this freedom,\r\n\r\nin  fact, does not exist for persons who do not have the income or the wealth\r\n\r\nto  make  such  a  purchase. Similarly, freedom to choose an  occupation  is\r\n\r\nlimited by the number of jobs going and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  person's ability and qualification. And today even in economic  theory  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  the freedom of choice has been relegated to a very secondary  role,\r\n\r\nfor we no longer have in any part of the established world today the freebooting\r\n\r\nfree enterprise system that you had in the Victorian era. There are controls, if\r\n\r\nnot  in detail, certainly in the aggregate which are exercised by any government\r\n\r\nof a modern State to ensure that the economy is kept going on an even keel, that\r\n\r\nthe balance of payments problem does not get out of hand, and that a fairly high\r\n\r\nlevel  of  employment is sustained; but I am not going into this.  My  point  is\r\n\r\nthis, that freedom of choice is not, therefore, an absolute concept, and when we\r\n\r\ndiscuss  political affairs and borrow this concept from the economists, similar\r\n\r\nlimitations apply, and these limitations may well apply to a more severe degree,\r\n\r\nfor  politics  is  essentially the art of what is possible. Freedom  of  choice,\r\n\r\ntherefore, means freedom to choose from what is possible in any given situation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what are the choices possible to the electorate in Singapore at the\r\n\r\npresent  moment in respect of merger? Let me answer this question. I may  answer\r\n\r\nthis question more easily by stating what is not possible, it is obvious even to\r\n\r\nthe meanest intelligence, and I would include the Barisan in this category, that\r\n\r\ncomplete merger on terms superior to those enjoyed by any existing State in  the\r\n\r\nFederation is not possible. And if this, in fact, is the choice that the Barisan\r\n\r\nwants to present to the electorate in a referendum, then the choice must clearly\r\n\r\nbe  ruled  out  for  two reasons. First, on the simple ground  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible. Second, more to the point, because the Barisan Sosialis knows that  it\r\n\r\nis  not  possible and therefore dishonestly asks for it in an effort to  prevent\r\n\r\nmerger.  There is therefore no breach in the principle of the freedom of  choice\r\n\r\nif  the  Barisan's  claim  for super merger is not offered  to  the  electorate.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  to  offer something impossible of achievement would be to perpetrate  a\r\n\r\nfraud upon the electorate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter for consideration is whether the electorate should be free to\r\n\r\naccept  or reject each and every type of merger offered for its choice, and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson insists that human decency demands that the electorate  should\r\n\r\nhave  the  right  to  accept or reject any form of merger offered  to  it  in  a\r\n\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it can be argued that in the 1959 general elections, all Parties put\r\n\r\nmerger  on  their platform, and therefore when the candidates were elected -in  a\r\n\r\nsense  it  can  be  said  that the electorate had made  up  its  mind  and  had\r\n\r\ncommitted:\r\n\r\nitself  to  a policy of merger with the Federation. It can therefore  be  argued\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not  necessary to sound the electorate on this  particular point\r\n\r\nagain. Now, for myself I do not find this argument completely convincing, and  I\r\n\r\nam  prepared to go a long way with the Member for Anson to understand his  point\r\n\r\nof  view.  Now, if this were the only consideration, then I would say that  the\r\n\r\nelectorate should be given the option once again to decide whether on  not  they\r\n\r\nwant merger in any of the forms put to it at the referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> But, Sir, there is a more decisive consideration and it is\r\n\r\nthis. The Barisan Sosialis are fully committed to complete merger on the  basis\r\n\r\nof  equality with any of the States of the Federation. They have said so openly.\r\n\r\nThey  have committed themselves in writing and in speeches in this Assembly.  It\r\n\r\nis  only when they found out the real consequence of such a type of merger  that\r\n\r\nthey  tried  to, back out of this commitment, and then added further conditions\r\n\r\nsuch as automatic conversion, immediate general elections in the Federation  and\r\n\r\nin Singapore after merger, and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say that if the Barisan Sosialis are really honest in their desire for\r\n\r\nmore  merger than the P.A.P., then I say the citizens should be given the right\r\n\r\nto  opt  out  of  merger if they so want. I go further and say  if  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis will campaign honestly and vigorously for complete merger on an\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nequal  basis  with  any of the 11 States of the Federation, then  I  admit,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  that this clause on blank votes is unnecessary. And  I  will  go\r\n\r\nfurther  and say that the electorate should then have a choice to say  \"yes\"  or\r\n\r\n\"no\"  to  any  merger  proposal - any form of merger  proposals - submitted  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum,  In  these  circumstances then, if we all  agree  we  shall  have  a\r\n\r\ncompletely honest referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the referendum where many Parties participate, to have an honest\r\n\r\nreferendum  means  having  honesty  observed  in  respect  of  each  and   every\r\n\r\nparticipant. When one of the Parties is dishonest, then you no longer  can  have\r\n\r\nan  honest  referendum. When the Barisan Sosialis say they want complete  merger\r\n\r\nand,  on  the  other hand, their ground level propaganda incites and  encourages\r\n\r\npeople  to oppose merger in any shape or form, then I say you will not  have  an\r\n\r\nhonest referendum, and the dishonesty lies fairly and squarely with the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. How can they, on the one hand, pretend to want complete merger?  True,\r\n\r\nthey  have added this rider of automatic conversion, this, that and the other,\r\n\r\nbut  we  will regard this as dishonest appendages to the original and, real  and\r\n\r\ngenuine proposal. How can they claim to be honest? How can they expect an honest\r\n\r\nreferendum to be carried out when they themselves behave in such an outrageously\r\n\r\ndishonest  manner? And we say it is precisely because the Barisan Sosialis  have\r\n\r\nno  intention  to  honour their word that the special precautions  embodied  in\r\n\r\nclause  29  are  necessary, but if the Banisan Sosialis are prepared  to  honour\r\n\r\ntheir  word and campaign genuinely and honestly to get people to accept complete\r\n\r\nmerger on terms of complete, absolute, unconditional equality with any of the 11\r\n\r\nStates, then I say we can have second thoughts on this clause.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Before the tea-break,\r\n\r\nI  drew  the  attention of the Deputy Speaker to the fact that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  was  reading  his speech from a prepared  document.  It  was  not\r\n\r\nintended in any way to embarrass the Deputy Speaker who fielded it, if I may\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nsay  with  respect,  rather well. But it was intended  to  highlight  certain\r\n\r\nfacts  which  are also pertinent to the speech of the Minister  for  Finance,\r\n\r\nand  it is this, that these prepared speeches are not really intended for our\r\n\r\neducation  or  edification;  that  they proceed,  before  they  are  in  fact\r\n\r\ndelivered  here, to the Ministry of Culture, and the purpose of reading  them\r\n\r\nhere  is to obtain the Legislative Assembly's immunity seal so that they  can\r\n\r\nbe  issued by the Ministry of Culture to all the Press with full immunity.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that instructions have been issued that the Press are to  give  70\r\n\r\nper  cent of all political space for the Government and not more thin 30 per\r\n\r\ncent  for the Opposition. Apart from this, Sir, it will interest you to  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  Chinese  Press is treated to a special delicacy  in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nstatements  issued by the P.A.P. in respect of matters which they might  have\r\n\r\nforgotten here or are too absurd for us even to entertain - issued by the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.     Propaganda Bureau, and the poor Chinese Press  is  to  carry  all\r\n\r\nthis nonsense every day.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we consider clause 28 and clause 29, we must consider them in\r\n\r\nthe  context  of two basic facts. One is clause 21, Sir, which  provides  for\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting and punishes a man who does not vote by  taking  his  name\r\n\r\noff the\r\n\r\nelectoral  register  and leaving his name off the electoral  register  until  at\r\n\r\nleast to the next revision. That is a heavy punishment. Sir.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second basic fact is the rejection by the Government of my amendment\r\n\r\nto  clause  20.  It is very brief, Sir, If I might refer you to  it - 'and  the\r\n\r\nvoter  shall record his vote in respect of each question by marking  a  cross\r\n\r\nin  one  of  two squares against each question marked respectively \"Yes\"  and\r\n\r\n\"No\".'.  Now  Sir, if there was no compulsory voting or - and I  do  not  say\r\n\r\n'and',  I  say  'or' -  if  there was provision that each  question  could  be\r\n\r\nanswered  with a yes or no, the Government would not have sought  to  dredge\r\n\r\nthe depths of infamy to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nproduce  a clause which blatantly makes a man into a woman - because that is  what\r\n\r\nthis  clause  seeks  to do - it would not be necessary. Blank votes  are  normally\r\n\r\nminimal.  Sir, I have drawn the attention of the House earlier and I  will  show\r\n\r\nyou - I  shall not read the provisions, but I shall merely refer to the  countries\r\n\r\nwhere there have been referenda held and where it has always been the rule  that\r\n\r\nblank  votes and ambiguous ballot papers are void. They do not count. Sir, first\r\n\r\nand  foremost, I have read the Hansard of last night and I understand  that  the\r\n\r\nWest Samoa ballot paper was read to you which provided that these should be what\r\n\r\nthey  call  informal  votes, as we say, void. Jamaica,  West  Australia,  South\r\n\r\nAustralia  and  New  South Wales where they have ad hoc legislation.  Australian\r\n\r\nReferendum Act. New Zealand - by the way, Sir. Samoa had its referendum provisions\r\n\r\nunder  the New Zealand Order in Council. British Columbia, Newfoundland, Canada,\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, France and, Sir, this will interest you. An infamous individual who\r\n\r\nfought  an  election  on  the  basis that he was saving  the  country  from  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  Hitler's  1932  Referendum Act.  Even  Hitler  accepted  the  basic\r\n\r\nfundamental  issue  that  a  referendum, as has been repeatedly  stated  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Benches, is a way to ascertain the wishes of the people. And if it is\r\n\r\nblank, it is void. If it is ambiguous, it is void. Last but not least, Sir,  may\r\n\r\nI  refer  you to section 48 (1) of our Legislative Assembly Elections  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich was promulgated by an imperial Government through its colonial masters  in\r\n\r\n1954? Sir, section 48 (1) refers to the void ballot papers and the amendment  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Queenstown seeks to restore to clause 28 the provisions  which\r\n\r\nhave  been  deleted  from it. It is a curious thing to recognise  that  our  own\r\n\r\npeople, our own citizens, our own elected Government can be more dishonest,  can\r\n\r\nbe  more  unjust  than the imperial government. But, Sir, the injustice  of  the\r\n\r\nimperial government is never shown in direct dishonesty. The P.A.P. have reached\r\n\r\na stage where it no longer matters if the people are fully conscious.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nof  their basic, their radical and their absolute dishonesty. I ask you to  look\r\n\r\nat  section  48 (1) (c) and compare it with the amendment we have. Sir,  in  the\r\n\r\nElections Ordinance the following is a void paper \"on which anything is  written\r\n\r\nor  marked by which the voter can be identified except the printed number on the\r\n\r\nback\", if  you look at clause 28 (1) (b) of the Referendum Bill, \"on which  the\r\n\r\nvoter has indicated his vote and has written or marked anything by which he  can\r\n\r\nbe  identified\". Sir, why that additional element? You will appreciate now  that\r\n\r\nif  the  voter  has  written anything or marked anything  by  which  he  can  be\r\n\r\nidentified, that vote will count as a P.A.P. vote. I do urge Members, I do plead\r\n\r\nbecause  I  do not think this has really been brought out. The Government  has\r\n\r\nnot  shown  why  it has changed. Section 48 (1) (c) of the Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections Ordinance in this manner as it reads now in clause 28 (1) (b)  of  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill, and it means this, Sir. That if a man writes on a voting paper,\r\n\r\n\"I believe in the P.A.P.\" and signs his name, that will count as a P.A.P. voting\r\n\r\npaper and no doubt, in due course, he will receive his reward because he has not\r\n\r\nmarked the vote. \"I believe in the P.A.P. I am a P.A.P. member. My P.A.P. number\r\n\r\nis  such and such.\" There is nothing to prevent those people from doing it. I do\r\n\r\nask the Government, since they have made this radical change, why have they made\r\n\r\nno explanation of this change at all? Mr Speaker, I do ask your Indulgence that\r\n\r\nif  the  Member  opposite wants to mumble and grumble, could he do  it  outside\r\n\r\nbecause it is disturbing?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> How stupid.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is also the business of the Chair. I think the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Law should contain himself.

I mean, supposing somebody writes, \"I do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlike  the P.A.P. I do not like any of these proposals.\" All this will count  for\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. because  he has not marked his vote. Before that  document  can  be\r\n\r\nvoided,  he  must  first mark his vote and then put some  means  whereby  he  is\r\n\r\nidentified.  The  two  are  not the same, Sir, but that  is  the  least.  It  is\r\n\r\nnevertheless the point which no other Member seems to have noticed and which the\r\n\r\nGovernment has completely glossed over today. Sir, the other paragraphs (c), (d)\r\n\r\nand  (e)  of  section 48 (1) are the identical provisions which the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown seeks to reintroduce into clause 28 (1) of the Referendum Bill.  That\r\n\r\nis  to say, he wants to make void all ballot papers which are unmarked and which\r\n\r\nare  void  for uncertainty. The Government tell you, and tell you quite rightly,\r\n\r\nthat  in  the original Bill as introduced in November, the provisions of section\r\n\r\n48  (1)  (c) and (d) of the Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance,  were,  in\r\n\r\nfact, incorporated in clause 28 of the Referendum Bill and ballot papers were to\r\n\r\nbe  void if they had written or marked on them anything by which a man could  be\r\n\r\nidentified, or if they were blank, or if they were ambiguous. The mystery of the\r\n\r\nchange  in  the first one has not been explained. But as regards the  other  two\r\n\r\nthey suddenly awakened to the danger of the Communists mounting a campaign.  And\r\n\r\nwhat  awakened them to the danger was that there was an amendment moved to  give\r\n\r\nthe  people the right to deface and destroy their ballot papers. Therefore, when\r\n\r\nthese amendments were moved by the Barisan - no, the phrase is \"pro-Communists  in\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis and the Member for Anson\" - The P.A.P. were suddenly awakened\r\n\r\nto  the  fact that there would be a campaign mounted to tell the people to  cast\r\n\r\nblank votes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have asked for - and I trust you have it before you - Supplement No. 11 of the Legislative Assembly of the Third Session, and you will notice\r\n\r\nthat  the so-called arch-Communist who introduced the provision, whereby persons\r\n\r\nneed not be punished for defacing their ballot\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npapers  or for destroying their individual ballot papers, is none other  than\r\n\r\nmyself.  I am the person, and I would ask you to look at clause 31,  at  page\r\n\r\n110  of  Supplement No. 11. You will notice that no other person was at  that\r\n\r\nstage  associated with me in that amendment. It was sent in by me. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown  had sent in several amendments. He did not notice  my  amendment  and it stood in my name alone. I seem to be the arch-Communist who  had\r\n\r\nawakened  them  to a Communist plot. Let me first explain why  I  did  it.  I\r\n\r\nwould  not like to take special credit, Sir - and certainly not the Barisan  at\r\n\r\nthat  stage - but  most of us by then were conscious from the speeches  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment (the way it inflated and distorted the Barisan's stand  about  the\r\n\r\nconstituent  state), we were conscious that it was going to try and  use  the\r\n\r\nBarisan's  stand as an alternative. And although I had not worked it  out  at\r\n\r\nthat  stage exactly how it would happen, nevertheless, it occurred to me that\r\n\r\nsome  voter, in accordance with his conscience, might want to say nothing  or\r\n\r\njust  deface his ballot paper. And there was nothing more Machiavellian  than\r\n\r\nthat,  that a man should be entitled to deface his paper if he was offered  a\r\n\r\ndishonest  alternative. I will say to you frankly, Sir, that in one  election\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nwrote  across  my  ballot paper, \"I do not like my choice.\" I  cannot  see  that\r\n\r\ncould, or should, call for criminal penalties of the nature indicated.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely I was exercising a legitimate right to express my regret and\r\n\r\nfrustration  that  the  choice offered to me of  candidates  was  not  of  a\r\n\r\ncharacter  which  pleased me and that I was not going to vote  for  anybody.\r\n\r\nThat  was  the  arch-Communist scheme to mount a  campaign  to  confuse  the\r\n\r\npeople  into  casting blank votes. And I want to say this to you,  Sir.  The\r\n\r\narch-Communists  must  be  awfully stupid - I am  happy  to  note,  remarkably\r\n\r\nstupid - to concentrate on the question of casting blank votes, because  if  a\r\n\r\nhundred people go to vote,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nten  say 'P.A.P.'. three say 'Penang and Malacca', and 87 cast blank votes,  you\r\n\r\ndo appreciate, Mr Speaker, that the ten who voted for the P.A.P. proposals will\r\n\r\nbe  deemed to be the majority. There is no question about that. How stupid it is\r\n\r\nto  mount a campaign that persons should cast blank votes, when the blank  votes\r\n\r\ndo  not  count,  even though there is a moral indication of defeat  of  the  two\r\n\r\npropositions.  From  that point of view, they have some significance,  but  they\r\n\r\nhave  no legal significance, because the majority vote is, by virtue of the fact\r\n\r\nthat  ten  out  of  that hundred voted for the P.A.P. proposals,  therefore  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. proposals are accepted ten to three.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the whole crux of any effort under this referendum is to give the people\r\n\r\nthe  right  to say yes or no. But why then is this Government seeking to  dredge\r\n\r\nfrom  the  depths  of  infamy  this extraordinary  constitutional  but  infamous\r\n\r\napproach of, \"We by law declare that a man is a woman. \"You can, Sir - legally\r\n\r\nand  constitutionally, and completely inhumanly. You bring the law, the  process\r\n\r\nof  making laws, and the process by which the law-makers are elected,  all  into\r\n\r\ncontempt. The merger proposals, that is to say, Command Paper No. 33  of  1961,\r\n\r\naccording  to the Government Benches, have been debated ad nauseam, and  I  will\r\n\r\nagree at least to the extent that they have been fully debated in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nAnd  there  has been a vote of 33 to 18 walking out. If persons are so  confused\r\n\r\nthat  they want to say to the Legislative Assembly, \"We want you to make up  our\r\n\r\nminds  for  us,\"  Mr Speaker, is it not their duty to mark yes against  Command\r\n\r\nPaper No. 33 of 1961? \"We want the Legislative Assembly to make up its mind  for\r\n\r\nus.\" Well, it has made up its mind. The Legislative Assembly by 33 to 18 walking\r\n\r\nout has decided that Command Paper No. 33 of 1961 is good. Therefore, those who\r\n\r\nwant  the Legislative Assembly to guide them, according to the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs, who, very patronisingly, said, \"Of course, those people would be  quite\r\n\r\nright in seeking our guidance.\" But the guidance is already there. Why\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndo they not say yes? What other guidance? For a change, silence is eloquence.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I would\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  the  Member  for Anson that when he asks a rhetorical  question  he\r\n\r\ninvites interjections. If interjections are forthcoming, then of course disorder\r\n\r\nresults eventually.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, it is a\r\n\r\nrhetorical question, if you will, but it is a question which none of  them  will\r\n\r\nseek  to  answer. It is a question that goes to the root of all the  smokescreen\r\n\r\nand  hypocrisy about wanting to make provision for the poor confused  voter  who\r\n\r\ndoes  not  know how to vote and wants the Legislative Assembly to  help  him.  I\r\n\r\nrepeat,  if he wants to follow what the Legislative Assembly wants, why does  he\r\n\r\nnot  vote  for  the P.A.P. proposals? He does not vote for the P.A.P. proposals\r\n\r\nbecause he does not want them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why does the Government want to introduce this question of blank votes?\r\n\r\nBecause  it  has recognised that if it leaves it at one question, which  is  the\r\n\r\nonly  question passed by this Assembly, then you cannot say that the people have\r\n\r\nhad an alternative, or have had the right to reject. You have got to leave it to\r\n\r\nyes or no, and there is a chance that the merger proposals would be rejected. So\r\n\r\nwhat are they to do?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have mounted this dishonest campaign of distortion about Penang and\r\n\r\nMalacca, constituent States, being in accordance with constitutional provisions.\r\n\r\nIf  Singapore  came in on the same terms, Singapore citizens, or half  of  them,\r\n\r\nwould  not obtain citizenship. They then fixed it on the Barisan Sosialis.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthey claim the right not only to have their own dictionary of English words, but\r\n\r\nto create a dictionary for the Opposition. The Opposition, in the Hansard on the\r\n\r\n21st  of  November,  1961, at column 406, made clear their stand  by  moving  an\r\n\r\namendment  to  say  that we want to go in as a constituent State  with  complete\r\n\r\nmerger and with Federal citizenship to all Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nThat  was our understanding of complete merger as a State. Mr Speaker, I should\r\n\r\nimagine  that  even the distorted mentality of the P.A.P. understood  their  own\r\n\r\nphrase, \"struggle for independence through merger\" in the same light. And it  is\r\n\r\ninteresting  to  notice that in their \"The Tasks Ahead\" there  is  nothing  said\r\n\r\nabout  merger but just their original constitution where they will struggle  for\r\n\r\nindependence through merger with the Federation. Sir, did they not at that  time\r\n\r\nconceive merger in the same way that we on this side, and I gather all of us  on\r\n\r\nthis  side, did, because the S.P.A. has actually stated what its view on  merger\r\n\r\nis?  Was  it  not the view of the P.A.P. that complete merger means identity  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship? That is what we all understood. But no. They would have it that the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  meant  that it was going to deprive  the  people  of  341,000\r\n\r\ncitizens. That is what the Barisan Sosialis wanted. Therefore, they are going to\r\n\r\nput the Barisan Sosialis proposal. Why this tenderness for the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker? Why this solicitude for the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Speaker? Why this\r\n\r\nsudden kindness to the Barisan Sosialis when they have repeatedly said that they\r\n\r\nare  not a philanthropic organization, that the Barisan Sosialis are a Communist\r\n\r\nfront  organization,  and  they  are not going to  help  the  Barisan  Sosialis?\r\n\r\nBecause, Mr Speaker, it is necessary to have some excuse to have an alternative\r\n\r\nquestion which would not be acceptable. That is the smoke-screen. And then  they\r\n\r\nwill  say to the people, \"Well, we have given you a chance to reject the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nproposals, you can accept the other one.\" And then they realise that there  will\r\n\r\nbe a lot who may want neither. It is true that blank votes have no legal effect,\r\n\r\nSir.  But  can you not see the moral implications of a majority of  blank  votes\r\n\r\ncast at this referendum? So my amendment about defaced ballot papers has nothing\r\n\r\nto  do  with it, my amendment which they stuck on the poor Barisan Sosialis  who\r\n\r\nhave to carry my sins as well as their own. That has nothing to do with it, Sir.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the recognition that giving two alternatives would then force the people\r\n\r\ninto the position where their\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nconscience did not permit them to accept either, to cast blank votes, and if the\r\n\r\ntotal  of  the  blank votes counted indicated that there was a majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople who cast blank votes, it would be obvious that the majority of the people\r\n\r\ndid  not  want  the  merger proposals. So we had in March the amendment  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to introduce the provision which, according to their own Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance, is based on neither constitutional nor legal principles.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nSir,  the  Minister  for Home Affairs spoke touchingly about  inducing  innocent\r\n\r\npeople  to  cast blank votes and to wreck the referendum. Because the Opposition\r\n\r\nasks for the right to say no, we have the curious spectacle of a Minister of  an\r\n\r\nallegedly  democratic  Government, the Minister for  Finance,  saying  that  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of freedom of choice is not basic to democracy. No. We understand  more\r\n\r\nand more how these Fascists in thought and in their way of life have camouflaged\r\n\r\nthemselves and utilised the democratic process to get into government.  Because.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  concept of freedom of choice is basic and is the very cornerstone  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy - the  right  to choose a candidate or not to  vote  for  any  of  the\r\n\r\ncandidates on a list, and in a referendum, as has been repeatedly said  to  you;\r\n\r\nthe  right to accept or reject any proposal. To say that the concept of  freedom\r\n\r\nof choice is one that has no place in human society is for the P.A.P. to condemn\r\n\r\nthemselves  publicly  as  essentially  a Fascist,  a  dictatorial  organization,\r\n\r\nwhether Fascist or Communist.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is it that they fear in the right to say no? (And the right to say\r\n\r\nno  implies the right to say yes.) They talk about \"confusing the citizens\";  if\r\n\r\nin fact the Barisan Sosialis are capable of confusing the citizens to the extent\r\n\r\nof  getting all of them, or the vast majority, against the merger proposals, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, democratically they are entitled to benefit by that in the same way  as\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. when it came to office. The reason why a man casts his vote  is  not\r\n\r\nfor this Assembly. This Assembly gives\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhim a choice. We know there are people who do not understand the choice. We know\r\n\r\nthere  are  people who half understand the choice. We know there  are  some  who\r\n\r\nfully  understand  the choice. We know that in accordance  with  the  democratic\r\n\r\nprinciple,  on  balance, this is a healthy procedure and usually the  answer  is\r\n\r\nnormally  right, in the same way as you have juries, which the  Front  Bench  so\r\n\r\nhates, in respect of grave offences, Sir. There may be some jurors who really do\r\n\r\nnot  understand  the  issue, but, on balance, it has been found  that  the  jury\r\n\r\nsystem  is a wonderful protection for the rights of the individual. In the  same\r\n\r\nway, the democratic principle whereby a man, no matter how stupid, no matter how\r\n\r\nconfused, and no matter how humble, has the same right to say yes or no  as  the\r\n\r\narrogant Prime Minister himself.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has asked, why does the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nnot  want us to ask the citizens of Singapore to vote for their form of  merger?\r\n\r\nBut  surely the answer, Sir, is because they will not do it. Because the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment will not put that alternative. Immediately following the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome Affairs, the Minister for Finance stood up and told you that if the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  insisted on putting their own interpretation of their  requirement  to\r\n\r\nthe  voters, that would be dishonest.

We have got to\r\n\r\nhave  it and we have got to have it now. Anything that you seek which you cannot\r\n\r\nget  now  is dishonest. So, were the P.A.P., on that definition, Sir,  dishonest\r\n\r\nduring election time in saying we will fight for merdeka? They were dishonest in\r\n\r\n1954  and 1955 when they said they would struggle for independence because  they\r\n\r\nknew  they  could  not get it. They were dishonest, as they allege  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are  dishonest,  in  saying that the basic  minimum  for  the  healthy\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  Singapore is that there should be a common citizenship  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore and the people of the Federation both for our welfare  and\r\n\r\nfor the common welfare. Maybe we cannot get it today. If we cannot get it today,\r\n\r\nwe  will  wait until we get it. That, according to the Minister for Finance,  is\r\n\r\ndishonest. That according to the Minister for Home Affairs is dishonest, as  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  do  not want it put. Sir, it is true  that  the  two  written\r\n\r\nspeeches will find their way into the Press and into Radio P.A.P. What  we  have\r\n\r\nto  say in reply will not. It is true that their votes, with the support of  the\r\n\r\nFront  Bench of the Opposition, will carry this most dishonest measure that  has\r\n\r\never  seen the light of day in this country, to my knowledge. It is unhappy  but\r\n\r\ntrue,  but  I  say,  Sir, that we who seek to battle for  recognition  of  basic\r\n\r\ndecency  should not, therefore, keep quiet. I ask you to notice that this  legal\r\n\r\nrigging  has drawn the courteous but passionate denunciation of the intellectual\r\n\r\nyouth  of  Singapore. You know, Sir, apart from the circular  we  all  received,\r\n\r\nthere have been statements issued in the name of the University Law Society, the\r\n\r\nSingapore  University,  and  you yourself are aware of  the  passionate  unhappy\r\n\r\ndenunciation  by  another group of intellectual youth,  the  Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nGraduates  Guild,  the  Nanyang  University  Students'  Union,  the  Polytechnic\r\n\r\nPolitical  Society,  the Singapore University Socialist Club,  and  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity Political Science Society.

But he tells us that  the 40  Old  Boys' Associations are all Communist front organisations, the 38  trade\r\n\r\nunions are all Communist front organisations, the Country People, whom he  calls\r\n\r\ncountry  bumpkins, and I hope that for a change the Press, which is so  kind  to\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.,  will carry at least that part of his message and his contempt  for\r\n\r\nthe  country  people. The country bumpkins, according to him, and  the  Hawkers'\r\n\r\nAssociation  are all Communist front organisations. You know, Sir, these  people\r\n\r\nwhom  he  contemptuously refers to as country bumpkins today were the people  he\r\n\r\nassiduously cultivated not so long ago in order to be elected. He tells us that\r\n\r\nthey  are  all  Communist front organisations, and that they have  asked  for  a\r\n\r\nnefarious  60  per  cent majority in order to render valid  a  decision  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  You  know,  Mr Speaker, and in fairness he was quite  fair  there,  he\r\n\r\nindicated that I was against that provision, and very strongly against it - to  me\r\n\r\nit  is  illogical - but  the  fact that these organisations,  to  our  mind,  want\r\n\r\nsomething  illogical does not make what he is doing logical. Two wrongs  do  not\r\n\r\nmake a right, Sir. Because the Communists, assuming they are Communists, do  not\r\n\r\nlike  clause 28, it does not mean it is good. I have no doubt the Communists  do\r\n\r\nnot  like  to drink poison. The fact that they do not like poison does not  make\r\n\r\npoison good. We must be careful, Sir, because this is a specious piece of  logic\r\n\r\nto  which people can fall prey. Because we do not like the Communists, therefore\r\n\r\nanything the Communists want is wrong. Therefore, everything that the Communists\r\n\r\ndo not want is right. That sort of logic, Sir, would land us in an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nawful mess. I have no doubt whatsoever that there can be occasions when what the\r\n\r\nCommunists do not want, I do not want either, as an honest democrat;  and  there\r\n\r\ncan  be occasions when what they want I want too, but for different reasons,  as\r\n\r\nan  honest democrat. In this case, Sir, the only excuse the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nhas to justify what he himself admits is a clause based on neither legal nor con\r\n\r\nstitutional principles is the fact that the Communists do not like it; therefore\r\n\r\nit  must be good. Sir, he said if the Barisan Sosialis would fight for a  merger\r\n\r\nin accordance with the constituent States of the Federation, then he would agree\r\n\r\nthat  everybody would have the right to say 'yes' or 'no', and that there should\r\n\r\nnot be this nefarious clause. Is it not fair to ask the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance:   Are we running this country for the Barisan Sosialis? If we are,  why\r\n\r\ndo  we  not  hand  it  over to them? If we are not, why then  not  approach  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  on the basis that you agree is just. I cannot see how it can  matter\r\n\r\nwhether the Barisan Sosialis are or are not in favour of merger on the basis  of\r\n\r\na  constituent State. The trouble about a constituent State, Sir,  is  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. themselves have so sullied and distorted it that, though it may  at  one\r\n\r\ntime have been acceptable, by virtue of the interpretation which the P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nput,  it  is  one  which  they know nobody now can accept.  But  what  I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  from  the Minister is what kind of assurance he  wants  which  would\r\n\r\nenable us to have an honest referendum. He says, and says truly, where one party\r\n\r\nto  a referendum is dishonest, you cannot have an honest referendum. Sir, I  say\r\n\r\ntruly,  with  this  modification, where a party to a referendum,  which  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Party, is dishonest, you cannot have an honest referendum. Because it\r\n\r\nis the Government's dishonesty which permeates and controls the entire machinery\r\n\r\nof  this  referendum.  The  way the question is put,  the  way  the  people  are\r\n\r\ncompelled to answer it, and even the shameless way whereby the true results\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  hidden, whereby the people are not allowed to know what is the  number  of\r\n\r\nblank  votes, what is the number of ambiguous votes. It is the Government  which\r\n\r\nis seeking flexibility for dishonest maneuvre and seeking a specious excuse that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis might confuse the people. No, Sir, it is not the  Barisan;\r\n\r\nit  is not the Member for Anson; it is none of us who are seeking to confuse the\r\n\r\npeople.  If we could have an impartial commission - and it is my prayer  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  not  too distant future, when matters are still topical, there will  be  an\r\n\r\nimpartial commission to recognise dishonesty in high places and to punish  it - I\r\n\r\nsay  if there was an impartial commission, it would be clearly seen that  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. that have been acting dishonestly in the distortion which they  have\r\n\r\nput  forward,  that  the P.A.P. are ruthlessly intent on forcing  through  their\r\n\r\nproposals  irrespective  of  what the people of Singapore  want.  They  are  not\r\n\r\ninterested. They prefer that the people of Singapore should want it, but if  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore do not want it, \"Well, we are in power and we are jolly well\r\n\r\ngoing to see it through.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no words are adequate to express the deep revulsion at this public\r\n\r\nexhibition of treacherous perfidy by trusted people. I have sought to expose the\r\n\r\nblatant falsehoods of some of the specious arguments urged which will find their\r\n\r\nway  into the newspapers, not because I have any hope that any argument, however\r\n\r\nvalid, would have any effect upon this Government, or, unfortunately, any effect\r\n\r\non  the Front Benches of the Opposition. They have made up their minds. I  stand\r\n\r\nas  one who has seen the tragedy that is approaching. I refer to the tragedy  of\r\n\r\nconcretization of perfidy in the referendum, because I want to leave  apart  the\r\n\r\nmerger issue for the moment - its merits and demerits - and deal with the perfidy of\r\n\r\nthe  referendum. It is a tragedy, Sir, that 624,000 people, the majority of whom\r\n\r\nare  new citizens for whose minds and for whose hearts we have struggled, and  I\r\n\r\nhave  been  part  of  that  struggle,  in sincerity,  through  dreary  Committee\r\n\r\nmeetings, through mass\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrallies, through corner street talks, through house-to-house visits. For 7 years\r\n\r\nand more, Sir, we have struggled to awaken in them a recognition of the glory of\r\n\r\nthe   parliamentary  democratic  process  and  its  validity  for  the   healthy\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of the human individual. That they should now be able to  point  to\r\n\r\nthis  as the culmination of that glory is a tragedy which unfortunately it  will\r\n\r\nbe our successors who will reap.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>     [Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, Sir, the Members in the Opposition have advanced\r\n\r\ntheir  arguments clearly on the National Referendum Bill. We are of the  opinion\r\n\r\nthat there should be only one question posed so that the people can decide.  But\r\n\r\nfrom  what  has happened, we can see that the Government is bent on  posing  two\r\n\r\nunacceptable  questions to the people and thereby the Government hope  that  the\r\n\r\npeople may not have any choice to cast blank votes or abstain. The P.A.P. Government now want to provide that such votes be deemed to be votes in support of the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Mr Mammen, Sir, the purpose of our amending this provision is to  \r\n\r\nexpose  the  P.A.P's  dictatorship. The P.A.P.'s phoney parliamentary  democracy\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  laughing  stock of the world. In all the countries  in  the  world,\r\n\r\nwherever  there is a national referendum Ordinance there has never been  such  a\r\n\r\nprovision. Even arch dictator Hitler never provided such a provision.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, that the electors would cast blank votes or uncertain votes\r\n\r\nmeans  that there must be various reasons. For instance, they may have no choice\r\n\r\nat  all.  Perhaps they may not understand the questions posed. Perhaps they  may\r\n\r\nnot want to express their views. So those blank votes and uncertain votes, as  a\r\n\r\nresult, should in no circumstances be construed as votes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nin  support  of the Government's proposition. The P.A.P. have exposed themselves\r\n\r\nvery  clearly as regards their intention. They have used the Communist bogey  as\r\n\r\ntheir pretext and, at the same time, they are trying to suppress the people. The\r\n\r\noligarchy  of the P.A.P. has made use of the propaganda machinery, such  as  the\r\n\r\nradio  and so on. The oligarchy of the P.A.P. has raised the bogey of Communists\r\n\r\nsaying that they want to wreck the national referendum and induce the people  to\r\n\r\ncast blank votes and uncertain votes. In fact, Mr Mammen, are the Communists so\r\n\r\nstrong that they wield so much influence over the people? According to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  there are only 300 Communist cadres in Singapore. At  the  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia Correspondents' meeting the Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, said that the\r\n\r\nCommunists in South-East Asia have never been so isolated in this region.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, in view of the assertion made by the Prime Minister that the\r\n\r\nCommunists  are  so  very  isolated and that there are very  few  Communists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  how  can  the P.A.P. justify their argument that  the  provision  is\r\n\r\nintroduced because the Communists are inciting the people to cast blank votes in\r\n\r\norder to wreck the national referendum? What is the true picture? The\r\n\r\nP.A.P., has raised this bogey of Communists in order to pass this Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the P.A.P. oligarchy should\r\n\r\nexpress  their thanks to the Communists because they hope to save themselves  by\r\n\r\nraising  the Communist bogey as a pretext. We know that people in all  walks  of\r\n\r\nlife  have expressed their dissatisfaction with this Bill, but the P.A.P. still\r\n\r\nhave  the  temerity  to  use the Communist threat as  an  excuse  for  the  most\r\n\r\nundemocratic  provision in the world. If the provision is passed as  it  stands,\r\n\r\nthen  the  people will have no right to express their free views and make  their\r\n\r\nchoice   at   the   national  referendum.  The  result  of   such   a   national\r\n\r\nreferendum - irrespective of what the result will be and how the P.A.P. may  claim\r\n\r\nto have the support of the people - cannot represent the true views of the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Order.

Members of this House will notice that the original Bill  did\r\n\r\nnot  have  this clause. It was only put in after the Communists gave us indirect\r\n\r\nnotice  of their evil intentions. First, you will remember the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\ngave  notice  of  an  amendment to make it lawful to destroy  or  deface  ballot\r\n\r\npapers. Now, nowhere in the world is there a precedent for this. The Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  is fond of quoting precedents. Just now he quoted a lot of precedents  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the law on referendum. Can he quote us an instance where it is lawful\r\n\r\nto  deface  or  destroy ballot papers? Is this the kind of  democracy  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson and the Barisan Sosialis want? The Communists and  those  who\r\n\r\noppose merger know that they are in a fix.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You are in a fix.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> They have no way\r\n\r\nout.  Therefore, they want to destroy or deface the ballot papers or  to  induce\r\n\r\nthe people to cast blank votes. In other words, they want to frustrate the democratic  process and frustrate the referendum. We are indeed thankful to them  for\r\n\r\ngiving  us  notice of their evil intentions. So the issue is this. Do  we  allow\r\n\r\nthem  to defeat the democratic process by defacing and destroying ballot  papers\r\n\r\nand  casting  blank votes? Therefore, it falls upon us, that is, the Government,\r\n\r\nto  make  suitable amendments in order to make it worth their while to  try  and\r\n\r\nfrustrate the democratic\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nprocess.  This  is very simple. That is why and how this new clause  has  to  be\r\n\r\nintroduced. If they had not tried to frustrate the democratic process,  we  also\r\n\r\nwould not have done this.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. The Barisan Sosialis themselves want these blank votes\r\n\r\nin their favour. That is, they want us to treat these blank votes as against the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper proposals. It has been said time and again by the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nthat  they  regard  this  amendment as an attempt at vote  pinching - deplorable,\r\n\r\ndisgraceful  and  several  other adjectives. They think  it  is  wrong  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  regard  undecided votes as being in favour  of  the  proposition\r\n\r\naccepted by this Assembly. But this does not prevent them from claiming that the\r\n\r\nblank votes should he regarded as opposing the Assembly decision.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, during the Select Committee hearing of witnesses, we put this\r\n\r\nquestion to the 38 trade union representatives: If you require the referendum to\r\n\r\nbe  supported  by  a certain percentage of affirmative votes  cast,  it  follows\r\n\r\nautomatically  that  blank votes and uncertain votes  are  counted  as  negative\r\n\r\nvotes. So, although the Barisan Sosialis say that it is wrong for the Government\r\n\r\nto  treat these votes as supporting the Assembly decision, it is honourable  for\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis Opposition to engage in vote hijacking. That  is  in  the\r\n\r\nwords of the Barisan Sosialis leader, the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, let me first debunk once again this so-called mandate which the P.A.P. was supposed to have received from the people.\r\n\r\nThey  keep  on repeating it. And we have already debunked it on many  occasions.\r\n\r\nBut  it bears repeating. They were never given a mandate specifically on merger,\r\n\r\nbecause  during  the general elections every Party had merger on  its  platform.\r\n\r\nAmongst  the Parties that were strongest for merger was the S.P.A. In fact,  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. had, as its slogan, \"If you want merger, vote S.P.A.\". The fact that  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. was  so overwhelmingly defeated showed that when the people elected  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npower,  merger was not in their minds. In fact, as has already been pointed  out\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Anson, and also pointed out by me during the merger debate in\r\n\r\nNovember  1961,  merger had never been the target of the  P.A.P.  It  was  never\r\n\r\nmentioned  in the bible of the P.A.P. - \"The Five-Year Plan.\" If you  run  through\r\n\r\nit,  Sir,  you  will not find a word of merger. Merger was only mentioned  as  a\r\n\r\ndistant possibility. Even in the policy statement of the first year - to an equal\r\n\r\nand   just   society - and  that  of  the  second  year - the  year   of   so-called\r\n\r\nconstruction - no  mention was ever made of merger. The P.A.P. has  publicised  so\r\n\r\nmuch  about Malaysia. But Malaysia was never even mentioned, Sir, in any of  the\r\n\r\ndeclarations of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   I do not think I need go into\r\n\r\ngreater  detail. But if they want to talk of the mode and manner, let us  remind\r\n\r\nthem that if they had really wanted to consult the people on the mode and manner\r\n\r\nof  merger, then the proper consultation should have been done before  the  fair\r\n\r\naccompli  was  foisted  on the people. That is, before the  White  Paper  merger\r\n\r\nproposals  were agreed to between the two Governments. If I may bring your  mind\r\n\r\nback,  Sir;  at that time, there was a split in the Party. We had  asked  for  a\r\n\r\nvoice  in  the mode and manner of merger. It was because of that that there  was\r\n\r\nthis  split.  Immediately after the split, and because the merger proposals  and\r\n\r\nthe  merger  question  were  coming up to the forefront,  we  suggested  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that since it would be proper to get the views of the people on  this\r\n\r\nmost important question, a general election would have been the most suitable in\r\n\r\norder  that the people of Singapore might elect a government more representative\r\n\r\nof  their views. Following that, if you will remember, Sir, after the Government\r\n\r\nhad  refused  to accept our suggestion, we asked for an All-Party Conference  in\r\n\r\norder  that we might have a voice in deciding on the mode and manner of  merger.\r\n\r\nAnd see now what choice is being offered to the people! It is not a case of mode\r\n\r\nand manner choice. It is something already fixed; something which says, \"Take it\r\n\r\nor leave it.\" That is what is happening.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many examples have been quoted to you about marriage. When you talk of\r\n\r\nmarriage in principle, you must remember that you just do not marry any old girl\r\n\r\nwho  comes  along or marry any old man you happen to meet. There is  always  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  finding the suitable partner, the proper timing and  place  for  all\r\n\r\nthis. Similarly, to use another analogy, if you are asked to cook food, it  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean that you are going to take arsenic or caustic soda served up  to  you.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will not labour on this.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to answer a couple of questions raised by the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  and Law and the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Finance  came  up\r\n\r\nwith  his  prepared  statement  and admitted that  clause  29  could  have  been\r\n\r\nunnecessary.  He  tried to justify the dishonesty of the P.A.P. in  putting  in\r\n\r\nclause  29  by linking it with the one-question amendment and the  51  per  cent\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has already drawn your attention to the fact that there\r\n\r\nis  compulsory  voting  and the fact that the P.A.P. has  already  rejected  our\r\n\r\namendment of one question to be posed to the people - the question that requires a\r\n\r\nsimple  answer  of \"yes\" or \"no\". The Minister for Finance very  rightly  linked\r\n\r\nthis  up with this question, because if it was only one question that was  going\r\n\r\nto  be  posed to the people, then this blank paper clause would not have arisen.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only  when  there  are two questions and when these  two  questions  are\r\n\r\nunacceptable  that  this blank clause comes in. We can see from  this  the  plot\r\n\r\nwhich  is  in the minds of the Ministers. They want to grab votes which  do  not\r\n\r\nrightly belong to them. As I have repeatedly told you, their plot is to pose two\r\n\r\nquestions,  both  unacceptable,  and with the expected  reaction  of  the  voter\r\n\r\nputting  in  a  blank vote, they want to grab this blank vote and  call  it  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. vote.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Minister for Finance tries to justify this blank vote clause by saying\r\n\r\nthat since the Opposition have claimed blank votes as negative votes, therefore,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  Government have every justification to claim these blank  votes  as  so-called  positive votes. Sir, let us say very categorically that  blank  votes\r\n\r\ndo  not mean positive or negative votes. They just mean non-supporting votes.\r\n\r\nThey  do not support the propositions \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\" that may be put  before\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument of the P.A.P. is that since there is this provision of 51 per\r\n\r\ncent,  therefore,  all the blank votes would work out to be  negative  votes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 51 per cent provision is a principle by itself. I will go into detail\r\n\r\non this 51 per  cent provision when we come to the debate on the amendment of  the  51\r\n\r\nper  cent.  But to counter this argument of negative votes, let us take  them\r\n\r\non,  for the sake of argument, that blank votes are negative votes. They  say\r\n\r\nthat  just because these blank votes are not supporting the Government votes,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they are negative votes. We have always maintained that  they  are\r\n\r\nnon-supporting  votes. If the P.A.P. calls these blank votes  negative  votes\r\n\r\nto  the White Paper, say, for example, proposition \"a\", similarly, they  can\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\ncalled negative votes to propositions \"b\", \"c\" or \"d\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>8.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, at the present moment, the P.A.P. are offering two alternatives - one alternative is the White Paper merger proposals and the other alternative\r\n\r\nis  the so-called complete unconditional merger or whatever type it is. If these\r\n\r\nblank  votes  are supposed to be anti-White Paper votes, similarly they  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  to  be anti-unconditional complete merger votes. So  how  does  that\r\n\r\nargument fit in with the P.A.P. contention that we are claiming that these votes\r\n\r\nare anti-P.A.P.? They can similarly be anti-anything if they want to consider it\r\n\r\nthat way. They can be anti a, b, c, d, e, f, or g, if as many alternatives  are\r\n\r\nput  before the people. So they are not negative votes or positive votes as  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. claim. They are just non-supporting votes because when a person is  faced\r\n\r\nwith two or more unacceptable\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nalternatives,  the natural reaction is to cast a blank vote. And it  is  because\r\n\r\nthey   themselves  know  this  to  be  the  natural  reaction  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nintentionally  want  to  pose to the people two unacceptable  alternatives  and\r\n\r\nthereby hope to get the blank votes and call them P.A.P. votes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another argument against their claim that blanks are so-called negative votes\r\n\r\nis  this. You will remember, Sir, that the P.A.P. said the blank votes were  put\r\n\r\nin  because  certain  people  claimed 51 per  cent.  If  you  trace  the  events\r\n\r\nhistorically, you will find that this blank-votes clause was put in  before  the\r\n\r\nSecond Reading of the Bill. The Second Reading was on the 14th or 15th of March,\r\n\r\nand  these  amendments were put in two or three days before, whereas the  unions\r\n\r\nsuggested  their 60 per cent only in Select Committee, and that  was  in  April,\r\n\r\nfully one month later. My own amendment of 51 per cent was put in in May. So  if\r\n\r\nthey want to argue that it was because of the claim of the 51 per cent amendment\r\n\r\nthat  they put in the blank votes clause then historically their argument  falls\r\n\r\nflat.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., through the Minister for Health and Law and the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance,  keep on harping on the same old theme that the clause on  blank  votes\r\n\r\nhad  been  put  in  to prevent the Communists from mounting a campaign  to, get\r\n\r\npeople to put in blank votes or to incite and confuse the people to put in blank\r\n\r\nvotes.  First of all, Sir, this presupposes that the voter is a fool. I am  sure\r\n\r\nnobody  in  his right senses will listen to any person - be he Communist  or  non-Communist - to do something which is against his own conscience. If the Communists\r\n\r\nwere to ask you to put your hands into filthy matter and rub it on your face,  I\r\n\r\nam  sure you will not do anything like that. It is only when you feel that it is\r\n\r\na  natural  and right thing to do that you do what you want to do. Moreover,  as\r\n\r\nhas  already  been repeatedly pointed out, there are only 300 odd Communists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In Indonesia, there are more than two million. They have  not  given\r\n\r\nany trouble to the Indonesian Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nJust  300 of them here and it is causing sleepless nights to our Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the real reason for this blank-votes clause is to pinch votes,  that\r\n\r\nis,  to pose to the voter two unacceptable questions and then to cash in on  the\r\n\r\nnatural  reaction to put in blank and uncertain votes and to pinch  those  blank\r\n\r\nvotes which the voters put in.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, every person in Singapore, in coffee-shops, villages and buses - the\r\n\r\nhawkers, workers, farmers, office workers and the intelligentsia - all are  aghast\r\n\r\nat  the undemocratic and dishonest way in which the P.A.P. Government are  going\r\n\r\nabout with this Bill. Whether they are Chinese-educated or English-educated  all\r\n\r\nare  aghast  at  the  P.A.P. Even foreigners, who pass through  Singapore,  have\r\n\r\nexpressed  surprise that Singapore should want to introduce such an undemocratic\r\n\r\nand  unheard  of unconstitutional provision. The P.A.P. themselves,  of  course,\r\n\r\nknow  it, and hence their trying to grab votes through this provision.  All  the\r\n\r\npolitical Parties on the Opposition Benches - the Barisan Sosialis, the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty,  the  United  People's Party and even the S.P.A. - are against  the  provision.  And  outside the Assembly, there is the Council of Joint Action,  which\r\n\r\nincludes  the  Liberal Socialists, the Party Rakyat, and the  United  Democratic\r\n\r\nParty.  Is it the suggestion of the Government that all these organisations  are\r\n\r\npro-Communist? The excuse they give is a very dishonest one. They say that since\r\n\r\nthe  Communists may encourage people to put in blank votes, so they must prevent\r\n\r\nthis  by grabbing those blank votes first. It amounts to a robber robbing a bank\r\n\r\non  the  excuse that another person is going to rob the bank; or to use another\r\n\r\nanalogy,  it  amounts to a person wanting to set fire to a house on  the  excuse\r\n\r\nthat another person may want to set fire to it. That does not make the action of\r\n\r\nthis robber or this arsonist democratic and right.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Minister for Health and Law says that it is nothing undemocratic to\r\n\r\noffer the voters two honest alternatives. The point is this: are they really\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhonest alternatives? We have repeatedly said that they have distorted our  stand\r\n\r\nof  full and complete merger. Our stand of merger means automatic conversion  to\r\n\r\nFederation   citizenship  and  proportional  representation   in   the   Central\r\n\r\nParliament. That is our stand of full and complete merger and any distortion  of\r\n\r\nthat stand cannot be called honest. Now they are asking people to become second-class citizens, or to lose half their citizenship. That is completely dishonest.\r\n\r\nI  will go into further details on this when I come to the motion standing in my\r\n\r\nname, condemning the Government for malicious distortion of our stand.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one word now to counter what the Minister for Finance said. He says again\r\n\r\nthat automatic Federal citizenship is not possible. I have already proved it  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  that  it  is  possible. It is possible under  Article  22  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Constitution.  But I will go into that  later  on.  Even  the  Tunku\r\n\r\nhimself admitted that it is possible. So there is no such thing as \"impossible\".\r\n\r\nWe  went to great lengths in the merger debate in November to explain this.  Now\r\n\r\nthey  say  that they want to put the distorted version of the Opposition  merger\r\n\r\nstand  to  the people. That is a very silly excuse to justify their  wanting  to\r\n\r\npose  two  questions  in the referendum because on national  matters  you  never\r\n\r\nconsider  the  view of only one or two Parties concerned. If it  is  a  national\r\n\r\nmatter, you must make sure that the alternatives and propositions you put to the\r\n\r\npeople are truly national in character.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close by just commenting on one sentence of the Minister for Health and\r\n\r\nLaw.  He  said  that clause 29 is both democratic and necessary.  Democratic?  I\r\n\r\nthink everybody in Singapore knows that it is not democratic. Necessary? Yes, it\r\n\r\nmay be necessary to the P.A.P. because without this clause they will not be able\r\n\r\nto  push and railroad through their merger proposals. But it definitely  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps it is convenient to suspend.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker thereupon left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I suspend the sitting until half-past nine.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>at 8.30 p.m. until 9.30 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Sitting resumed at 9.30 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28-(contd.)\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> An amendment by the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson said that further\r\n\r\ndebate  on the Referendum Bill would be useless because he thought that whatever\r\n\r\narguments we may put forward will not move the P.A.P.

That  is  why\r\n\r\nthey have presented their views to Members of this House.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the 25th of June, 40 trade unions presented a memorandum to all Members of this House. In this memorandum they pointed out the portions\r\n\r\nwhich  were undemocratic in clause 29. Because of clause 29 and other provisions\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill,  they intended to convene a conference of all organisations.  But\r\n\r\nthis  conference  was prevented from being held by the Special  Branch.  Let  me\r\n\r\ndisclose  that the Chairman of the Singapore All Trade Unions Working Committee - this  is  a notice to all Singapore trade unions which were going to attend  the\r\n\r\nconference which was to be held.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of\r\n\r\norder,  Sir.

Let  me  paraphrase  the\r\n\r\nmemorandum from the Chairman of the Working Committee to representatives of  the\r\n\r\nvarious organisations. This is the passage concerning the provision relating  to\r\n\r\nblank  votes and uncertain votes to be in support of the Government  and  to  be\r\n\r\nincluded with those votes in support of the Government. What the representatives\r\n\r\nof  the  various trade unions wanted to discuss is clause 29, which we  are  now\r\n\r\ndiscussing.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>9.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 9th of June, when the representatives of the various trade unions\r\n\r\nwanted  to  go  to the Singapore Motor Workers' Union's premises to  attend  the\r\n\r\nmeeting,  they were prevented from doing so by policemen. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\ncan  clearly see these trade unions represent all their members. They  are  also\r\n\r\nimportant  members  of  our  society.  On  something  which  will  affect  their\r\n\r\ndemocratic right, they have the responsibility and right to voice their opinions\r\n\r\nand  air  their views. But the Government has prevented them from doing  such  a\r\n\r\nthing.  This  action of the Government is not at all surprising to us.  What  is\r\n\r\nsurprising is that -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is perhaps drifting too far away from the amendment.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  he is anticipating the motion standing in the name of the Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson.

When we debate the motion by the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson, I will give my views thereon. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me paraphrase  what\r\n\r\nthe 33 Old Boys' Associations presented to the Select\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nCommittee  on the 27th of June. The 33 Old Boys' Associations gave three  points\r\n\r\nof advice to Members of this House, and not to the Select Committee. One of them\r\n\r\ntouches  on  clause  29,  which is under discussion. Let  me  paraphrase  their\r\n\r\nsuggestions in relation to clause 29. They say, \"We would like to suggest to the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  that all unreasonable provisions, especially  clause  29,\r\n\r\nshould  be  abolished.\"  These cultural organisations and  trade  unions,  whose\r\n\r\nexecutive members are elected from among their members, have full right  to  represent  their  members on views relating to the National Referendum  Bill.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment have alleged that these trade unions did not hold meetings to  obtain\r\n\r\napproval  for  sending  their  representatives to the  said  conference.  I  now\r\n\r\nchallenge  the  Government  to  say whether they consider  these  trade  unions,\r\n\r\ncultural  organisations,  rural organisations and hawkers'  associations  cannot\r\n\r\nrepresent the views of their respective members, in spite of the fact that  they\r\n\r\nwillingly  wanted to hold a rally to examine the contents of the Bill.  But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  said  that I cannot be a spokesman for them. But if  the  Government\r\n\r\nhave  the  guts,  let  them hold rallies and meetings just to  see  whether  the\r\n\r\nmembers of these organisations support the views of their leaders.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministers of the Government have made unprincipled\r\n\r\naccusations  which  are contrary to the will of the members of  these  organisations  and which are also a sort of smear. You will remember that in 1956  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  Committee on Human Rights Convention. One of the leaders of the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nMr  Devan Nair, was an important member of this Convention. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhad  a  very close connection with this Convention. This Human Rights Convention\r\n\r\nalso comprised organisations of Singapore. Will the Minister for Home Affairs or\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  say  that this Human Rights  Convention  was  a  Communist\r\n\r\norganisation? Would the Prime Minister say that the actions, the work and the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nviews  of  this  Human  Rights Convention did not represent  the  views  of  its\r\n\r\ncomponent parts?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

Sir, I would ask Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly to give serious thought to the matter under discussion and in order  to\r\n\r\nhave a proper appreciation of the move that the Government is making and why the\r\n\r\nGovernment  considers  it is necessary to make such a  move,  may  I  have  your\r\n\r\nindulgence,  Sir,  if  I  endeavour  to go briefly  over  the  history  of  this\r\n\r\nreferendum that necessitates the present stand of the Government?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was the original intention of the Government to pose one question to\r\n\r\nthe  electorate. They knew that they were going to lose because  the  electorate\r\n\r\nwould just vote against the White Paper merger proposals not because they do not\r\n\r\nwant merger but because they want to see the end of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n- the sooner the better. Therefore they got frightened and they tried to cook up\r\n\r\ntwo  questions and in their cleverness they thought it would be better  if  they\r\n\r\ncould put them in such a way that there could be only one possible answer.  When\r\n\r\nI heard of such dishonest manoeuvring, Sir, I was aghast, and I was naturally up\r\n\r\nin  arms  against any attempt by the Government to impose on the electorate  any\r\n\r\ndishonest referendum. Therefore, I was very, very much against any move  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment - to put it mildly - to cheat the electorate. When the Government  found\r\n\r\nthat  right  thinking  people would just throw in blank votes  in  protest,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. began to see the error of their ways. At the time when they proposed this\r\n\r\nparticular clause, they had in mind two questions:\r\n\r\n\"Do  you want the White Paper merger with autonomy in education and labour?\" Or.\r\n\r\n\"Do  you  want  Penang/Malacca type merger with 340,000 non-local born  citizens\r\n\r\nlosing  their  citizenship  rights?\" We were naturally  up  in  arms.  We  spoke\r\n\r\nvigorously  and without pulling punches; we called the P.A.P. dishonest  and  we\r\n\r\nwere  ready  to tear into them, to expose them for what evil they meant  to  do.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, as a result of the debate over the past four days, the Government  has\r\n\r\nagreed,  through pressure from us and from other Members of the  Assembly,  that\r\n\r\nthe  questions  must  be  straightforward and  honest  questions  and  that  the\r\n\r\nquestions to be posed in a referendum must first of all be fully debated in this\r\n\r\nAssembly. They have accepted that. Therefore the charge that dishonest questions\r\n\r\nwould be put - thereby calling upon us to put in protest votes - is now remote.  The\r\n\r\nquestions  will  be  fully debated in this House. The Prime Minister  has  given\r\n\r\nnotice of a motion whereby two questions will be posed and the first question of\r\n\r\ncourse will be Cmd. Paper No. 33 of 1961. The other question is going to be  com\r\n\r\nplete  and  unconditional merger. That is a straightforward and honest  presentation.  There is no presentation of a Penang or Malacca type merger with  340,000\r\n\r\nnon-local  born  citizens losing their citizenship rights. I  have  said  in  my\r\n\r\nspeeches on this debate that there could be a third question. The third\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nquestion could be \"Do the electorate want Singapore to enter the new Malaysia on\r\n\r\nterms  no less favourable than any one of the Borneo territories?\" I propose  to\r\n\r\nmove an amendment along that line when the motion is debated in due course.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if honest and straightforward questions are posed to the electorate\r\n\r\nto  get  their verdict, there can be little protest at all. In fact it would  be\r\n\r\nright  and proper to ask the electorate to cast their verdict. They are  totally\r\n\r\nfree  to reject Command Paper No. 33, but in the rejection of Command Paper  No.\r\n\r\n33  they would have considered which of the other two alternatives would  be  in\r\n\r\nthe  best interest of the people of Singapore. In deciding in their minds as  to\r\n\r\nwhich form of closer association would be more in the interest of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  political Parties represented in this Assembly would  be  given\r\n\r\nevery  opportunity  at referendum meetings to try and sell their  ideas  to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate.  Those  of  us who are against Command Paper  No.  33 -  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, the Workers' Party, the United Peoples Party, and the S.P.A. - could  go\r\n\r\nout  and  tell  the  electorate  that in their minds  complete  merger  is  more\r\n\r\ndesirable  and is more in the interest of the people of Singapore.  Or  if  they\r\n\r\nlike to take the line that what is offered to the Borneo territories should also\r\n\r\nbe  offered to Singapore, they are free to do so, and all the political  Parties\r\n\r\nshould rest content to leave it to the electorate to pass judgment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the P.A.P. say that they are aware that the Communists will be up to\r\n\r\ntheir  tricks and that in an attempt to damage merger they would be  working  on\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore to mislead them into casting blank votes. Sir, I, as one\r\n\r\nwho had been in the Government previously and had to contend with the Communists\r\n\r\nand  their subversive activities, have this to say. The P.A.P. have worked  with\r\n\r\nthem; the P.A.P. have given them legal cover and the P.A.P. have helped them  to\r\n\r\ngrow into what they are now, and having\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nworked  with them, perhaps the P.A.P. are in a better position to know  the  way\r\n\r\nthey  would  work to wreck anything that the Government propose, in  fact,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. had helped them to try to wreck me.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would not like to say that I am having the last laugh because they are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  wreck  the P.A.P., but in all our deliberations  in  respect  of  accusations  by the Government of Communist activities and Communist  attempts  to\r\n\r\nwreck  merger, one must be guided by the first principle - the interests  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry. As a political Party in the Opposition, it would be a grand opportunity\r\n\r\ntoday to kick as hard as we can against the P.A.P. and to call them all sorts of\r\n\r\nnames.  In  fact, they deserve those things. But is all this going to  help  the\r\n\r\ncountry?  I  doubt  very much. There is already sufficient confusion  over  this\r\n\r\nissue, and as the days go by there will be more and more confusion added  if  we\r\n\r\ndo  not try to bring sanity to the debate on a very important national issue.  I\r\n\r\nhave  said  to  the  P.A.P. many a time that if they  really  fear  that  their\r\n\r\nerstwhile Communist comrades will be up to tricks to damage the interests of the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, there is only one thing that they should do. But  they  do\r\n\r\nnot want to do it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

It would seem, Sir, that on this very important\r\n\r\nnational issue the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis are trying to play a game \r\n\r\n- not  chess - but a game for the existence of their own political  Parties;  a\r\n\r\ngame  to  win the hearts and minds of the people of Singapore. At least in  this\r\n\r\nparticular instance, I can say that the P.A.P. are playing the game in  the  way\r\n\r\nthat they think they should play in the interests of the people of Singapore.  I\r\n\r\ncannot say the same thing for their\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nerstwhile  comrades who have been described by them as Communists and  Communist\r\n\r\nfront leaders. We do not like to see undemocratic methods being employed, but as\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have  said, this is something which they want to use  to  beat  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  at their own game. As the Government have agreed that the  questions\r\n\r\nto  be posed will be fully debated in this Assembly and as an assurance has been\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the  Minister  for Home Affairs that this  Referendum  Bill  will  be\r\n\r\nrepealed  after the merger referendum, therefore, we feel that, in the interests\r\n\r\nof  the people of Singapore, we will abstain.

There will be very, very few  protest\r\n\r\nvotes,  and  if  there are very few protest votes, why are we wasting  our  time\r\n\r\ngoing hammer and tongs at one another? The fact that the Barisan are feeling  so\r\n\r\nstrongly  about this is that they intend to try and damage merger by calling  on\r\n\r\nthe electorate of Singapore to cast blank votes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a question has been asked. The S.P.A. will be on the side of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  against  the Communists, against the subversives,  against  those\r\n\r\npeople  who are out to wreck the interests of the people of Singapore, no matter\r\n\r\nwhat Party they belong to.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as has been said, blank votes and uncertain votes during election time\r\n\r\namounted to only one per cent.

It is difficult to  find  a\r\n\r\nparallel  in any other law. The Government, despite its present majority  of  25\r\n\r\nseats,  can  still  pass  any legislation by virtue of abstained  votes  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  But, Sir, for a law to be acceptable, it must receive  the  consent\r\n\r\nand express the popular will of the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, the question of blank votes has received much adverse\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncriticism  from every section of our society, even from those who supported  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  proposals. The Government's proposal to consider  blank  votes  as\r\n\r\nsupporting  the  Government's  constitutional  proposals  is  most  absurd.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  want  the people to vote for the White Paper.  They  have  given  no\r\n\r\nchoice  to  the people to say \"no\" to the White Paper. The people can only  vote\r\n\r\nfor an alternative which will be worse than the White Paper.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who accept the White Paper can put a cross in the appropriate column\r\n\r\nin  the  ballot  paper. Those who reject the White Paper cannot  put  any  cross\r\n\r\nanywhere,  except to leave the ballot paper blank. There will be  few  abstained\r\n\r\nvotes.  Few will vote for the second alternative, because the second alternative\r\n\r\nwill  be worse than the White Paper. It therefore boils down to this. The  voter\r\n\r\nactually has two choices. If he supports the White Paper, well and good. He puts\r\n\r\na  cross  in the appropriate column. But if he rejects the White Paper, he  will\r\n\r\nhave  no alternative but to throw in a blank ballot paper. In other words,  all\r\n\r\nthose  voters  who  throw in blank ballot papers would,  in  our  analysis,  be\r\n\r\nopposing  the White Paper and not merely being neutral or having no  opinion  at\r\n\r\nall.  In  the  coming  merger referendum, the situation  is  different  from  an\r\n\r\nelection  where there are few blank votes. In an election the reason for blank\r\n\r\nvotes  is  that  a few of the voters do not know how to vote. Therefore,  in  an\r\n\r\nelection  we  would  agree  that blank votes should be  treated  as  void  votes\r\n\r\nsupporting none of the candidates. But in the coming referendum, we  are  faced\r\n\r\nwith  an entirely different position because the voters who wish to vote against\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper have no alternative but to throw in blank votes. They are  not\r\n\r\nvoid  votes.  They are not votes which are neutral. They are  votes  which  are\r\n\r\nagainst the Government's White Paper proposals. That is why we have to move  an\r\n\r\namendment  to  make  the votes as anti-Government votes. Sir,  here  we  have  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  which is prepared to legislate anti-Government votes  into  becoming\r\n\r\npro-Government votes. Sir, I do not want to repeat old\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nand  stale  arguments  in this Chamber and waste the  time  of  Members.

It was our intention  to  highlight  the\r\n\r\nimportance  and the far-reaching consequences of the two vital amendments  to\r\n\r\nclause  5  and clause 29. The effect of clause 29, i.e. the blank  votes,  is\r\n\r\nthat  the Government could have a 99 per cent or even a 100 per cent victory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of such an undemocratic referendum is a foregone conclusion.

I am sure you will agree that the people who have been\r\n\r\nsaying that they are democrats, that they are here to defend democracy, to  make\r\n\r\ndemocracy tick in this part of the world, and that they are here to fight forces\r\n\r\nwhich  are  anti-democratic, are, in fact, those people who  today  sit  on  the\r\n\r\nopposite Benches. Sir, I do not remember having claimed to be ever a champion of\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy. This does not mean I am anti-parliamentary  democracy.\r\n\r\nBut I do not want to be a hypocrite.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You believe in democratic centralism. That is what you said.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I am quite used to listening to names and I do not mind what I\r\n\r\nam  called.  You can call me a Fascist, a Communist, or what have you.  But  the\r\n\r\npoint I want to make is this: it is not people in the Barisan Sosialis who  have\r\n\r\nhitherto claimed to fight evil forces, subversive elements, elements which  want\r\n\r\nto  wreck the democratic system. It is the people who are in the P.A.P. now. The\r\n\r\nvery  reason why the Government Members say they have included clause 29 in  the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill is, according to them, to fight the Communists; the  Communists\r\n\r\nare  out  to wreck the parliamentary system. I think it is not only hypocritical\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  equally  naive for Members on the Government Benches  to  seriously\r\n\r\nsuggest  that they are the people who are going to defend the democratic  system\r\n\r\nin this part of the world.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Sir, I am a very simple man. I do not claim to be one of the pillars\r\n\r\nof  parliamentary  democracy. For the information of Members on  the  Government\r\n\r\nside,  I  will  read  to them what their own master has  said  in  the  past  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy. I am sure nobody on the Government Benches  would  say\r\n\r\nthat their Prime Minister was a pro-Communist or a Fascist or was a man who  was\r\n\r\nwrecking the parliamentary system. And later on, perhaps, if I might quote  some\r\n\r\ninteresting bits which the Prime Minister himself has said about democracy.  And\r\n\r\nwe can judge this talk of democracy-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. Government want to practise by the standards which the  Prime Minister himself has set and preached about.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity the Minister for Finance is not here. I must really congratulate\r\n\r\nhim  on  having  made  a coherent speech, a very eloquent speech  in  which  the\r\n\r\narguments  have been coherently made; but, unfortunately, very neatly fabricated\r\n\r\nalso. Sir, this is the problem with the Minister for Finance. He is basically  a\r\n\r\ntheoretician  and  an economist. Therefore, he is more often  in  the  habit  of\r\n\r\nputting  forward highflown theoretical arguments and is inclined to  forget  the\r\n\r\npractical  side  of the theoretical arguments he puts forward. He  referred  to\r\n\r\nwhat I had said on freedom of choice, and went on to talk of the concept of free\r\n\r\ndemocratic choice in the Victorian age. Sir, I have no intention whatsoever  of taking  Members  of this House to a few hundred years back, the Victorian  age,\r\n\r\nnor  are Members of the Government Benches seriously interested in, I think, the\r\n\r\nVictorian age and their concept of freedom of choice, etc.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister said that we were asking for a negative \"no right\". Sir, he\r\n\r\nhas  had sufficient time to have his speech thought out carefully with the  help\r\n\r\nand  assistance given to him by able civil servants. I unfortunately do not have\r\n\r\nthe facilities of using Government paid stenographers and typists to prepare a\r\n\r\nspeech.  If  the Minister was able to put forward today an apparently  coherent\r\n\r\nargument, it is because he has had the time to work out a speech well thought \r\n\r\nout  and  well written, and with sufficient command of the English  language  he\r\n\r\nsought  to  say all that we in the Opposition seek is a negative  right  to  say\r\n\r\n\"no\".  And he said that in the affairs of men the negative right is not in human\r\n\r\naffairs; that is what he said.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are saying that they want to pose two alternatives, two totally unacceptable alternatives. This has been admitted by the Government Members\r\n\r\nthemselves. The Prime Minister himself\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhas  already  given  notice of a motion. There is no doubt whatsoever  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment want to pose two alternatives to the people. And we feel that if  two\r\n\r\nalternatives  are  to be put to the people, then the people must  be  given  the\r\r\n\r\nright to accept or reject them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the P.A.P. we do not start from the premise that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore must necessarily choose one of the two alternatives they put forward,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are trying to distort the Barisan Sosialis stand and say that the second\r\n\r\nalternative  is, in fact, the Barisan Sosialis stand. That, Mr Mammen,  is  not\r\n\r\ncorrect, and at the appropriate moment we will restate what the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nstand  is on the merger issue. But briefly, Sir, if they are going to say,  \"You\r\n\r\nchoose unconditional complete merger or the White Paper type of merger,\" it does\r\n\r\nnot  take  too much of imagination that this is a distortion of the Opposition's\r\n\r\nstand. We in the Barisan Sosialis have never at any time suggested that we  want\r\n\r\nunconditional merger. I will be obliged if the Government Members can quote  any\r\n\r\nrelevant  documents where we say we want unconditional merger.  Sir,  you  will\r\n\r\nknow that the term \"super merger\" is one that is only recently coined. It has only  been coined after we have started harping on the fact that they are  going\r\n\r\nto  pose two unacceptable alternatives. However, Sir, in the context where  they\r\n\r\nare going to pose two unacceptable alternatives, surely the people must be given  the right to either accept or reject or, if necessary, to abstain. This to me\r\n\r\ndoes not seem to be something unusual. There is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  nothing  unusual  about asking the Government  to  guarantee  these\r\n\r\nrights  in the legislation. This has nothing to do with the Communists,  nothing\r\n\r\nto  do  with the wrecking of the parliamentary system, and it has nothing to  do\r\n\r\nwith frustrating merger. It has been suggested that clause 29 is included in the\r\n\r\nBill  because the Barisan Sosialis want to frustrate merger. Why should we  want\r\n\r\nto frustrate merger?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the Members from the Government Front Bench know for a fact that\r\n\r\nmerger  or  no merger, nothing affects the democratic movement of the people  in\r\n\r\nthis  country.  So long as the Barisan Sosialis is confident that it  represents\r\n\r\nthe  democratic  movement of the people in Singapore, there  is  nothing  to  be\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  whether merger of the P.A.P. type is going to  materialise  or\r\n\r\nnot.  The  Government's  theory has been that because the  Barisan  Sosialis  is\r\n\r\nafraid  of merger, because the Barisan Sosialis thinks that it will be dissolved\r\n\r\nperhaps,  because the Barisan Sosialis leaders believe that they may be arrested\r\n\r\nif  there is merger, that we want to frustrate merger. Sir, I tell them once and\r\n\r\nfor all that our concentration is not on the dissolution of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nor cn the arrests of the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis. We are not a political\r\n\r\norganisation that is dependent on Government machinery for its survival. We  are\r\n\r\nnot  a  po1itical organisation that is dependent on individuals. We  derive  our\r\n\r\nstrength  from the people. We say, Barisan Sosialis or no Barisan Sosialis,  the\r\n\r\npeople's  movement goes on. And all the P.A.P.s in the world will not check  the\r\n\r\npeople's movement. We have no desire to frustrate merger in any way. But if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  means that our wanting to frustrate merger is in fact our opposition\r\n\r\nto  the White Paper merger, then we say that is true. We have stated openly that\r\n\r\nwe oppose the White Paper merger. We have stated our reasons for our opposition.\r\n\r\nQuite rightly, we expect the people to oppose the White Paper merger. It is  our\r\n\r\nobligation to ask the people to oppose the White Paper merger. Sir, we have  put\r\n\r\nforward  our  stand  on merger as complete merger where all  Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nautomatically will be converted into Federal citizens on merger day and where we\r\n\r\nwill get proportional representation in the Federal Parliament. I tell them what\r\n\r\nI  have  already stated once before. If the Government is sincere in wanting  to\r\n\r\nput forward the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis type of merger to the people, then the obvious thing is to  put\r\n\r\nforward  our official stand on merger. There can be no distortion about  it.  We\r\n\r\nmoved  an  amendment here in this House last year. We stated our stand in  clear\r\n\r\ncategorical terms, with no ambiguity and with no uncertainty. If the  Government\r\n\r\nis  serious  in  wanting to put forward the Barisan type  of  merger, then  the\r\n\r\nobvious thing to do is to say:\r\n\r\n\"(1)  Do you support the White Paper merger?; (2) Do you support complete merger\r\n\r\nwhere  all  Singapore citizens automatically become Federal citizens  and  where\r\n\r\nSingapore would have proportional representation in the Federal Parliament?\"  We\r\n\r\nsay  that we expect a government with some decency left at least to do this  and\r\n\r\nnothing  else.  But, Sir obviously the P.A.P. has degenerated to  the  position\r\n\r\nwhere it does not even show the common decency of allowing us to define our  own\r\n\r\nstand, it just wants to put forward a distorted version of our stand so  as  to\r\n\r\nmake  the proposition totally unacceptable to the people. We say that no  matter\r\n\r\nwhat  question  is  posed  to the people - whether it  is  one  question  or  two\r\n\r\nquestions;  whether it is to be two alternatives - the free choice of  the  people\r\n\r\nmust still be uninterfered with. We say that even if the Government is going  to\r\n\r\nput  forward the Barisan stand in just one simple question, because it  is  our\r\n\r\nstand,  we are not going to tell the Government to count all the blank votes  as\r\n\r\nvotes for our proposition. We tell them to put forward our proposition requiring\r\n\r\na simple \"yes\" or\r\n\r\n\"no\" answer, and blank votes are blank\r\n\r\nvotes,  and they cannot be recorded. This is because we believe in the  inherent\r\n\r\nright  of  the people to have an uninterfered free choice. I am not saying  that\r\n\r\nthis  is not a negative right that we are seeking from the people. It is in fact\r\n\r\na  positive right. It is a positive right because what is going to be  posed  to\r\n\r\nthe people in the referendum are to be just two alternatives. The people are not\r\n\r\ngoing  to be given 640,000 versions of merger to choose from. They are not going\r\n\r\nto be given a proposition for them to decide after having, in fact,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nascertained  whether  the people are in fact in favour of the  proposition.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s whole object is to pose two unacceptable alternatives and have  clause\r\n\r\n29  in the Referendum Bill so that they could produce the result at the end and\r\n\r\nsay,   \"So  many  per  cent  of  the  people  have  supported  the  Government's\r\n\r\nproposition.\"  They know full well that if they pose just one  question,  asking\r\n\r\nthe  people to choose whether they want the White Paper merger or not, then  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the people are bound to oppose it. It is because they are aware  of\r\n\r\nthis  that  they  want  to  pose  two  alternatives - not  only  two  unacceptable\r\n\r\nalternatives but in addition, they want to have blank votes counted as votes for\r\n\r\nthe  Government  proposition. Sir, this perhaps is  the  appropriate  moment  to\r\n\r\nexamine  what  in  fact  blank  votes  would  mean  in  a  situation  where  two\r\n\r\nunacceptable alternatives are posed to the people. In an election normally  the\r\n\r\nblank votes are negligible. But here the situation is quite different from  what\r\n\r\nwould prevail in an election where the choice is between a number of candidates.\r\n\r\nIf  two  unacceptable alternatives are posed, then there are bound to be  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  going  to  find  both  unacceptable.  And  if  both  propositions  are\r\n\r\nunacceptable, one has either the opportunity of putting in a blank  vote  or  of\r\n\r\nputting in a vote which could be spoiled. Now, in this case, Mr Mammen, Sir,  a\r\n\r\nblank  vote  is something that will be cast because one is uncertain  to  choose\r\n\r\nbetween  two alternatives. The chances are that if the government pushes through\r\n\r\nits  arrangement for a referendum on the basis of its utterances so far, it will\r\n\r\nbe  posing,  in  our view, two unacceptable alternatives, and in  our  view  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people are going to find both unacceptable. Therefore, they  are\r\n\r\ngoing to be unwilling to choose between two unacceptable alternatives.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> You want complete merger!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, if such votes are to be counted as votes for the Government\r\n\r\nproposition, then the least I could say, at least in the diction of the Barisan\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nSosialis, is that it is definitely not democratic.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has suggested that the S.P.A. is going to\r\n\r\nabstain. The Member for Cairnhill always interests me because he seems to  think\r\n\r\nthat  if  he  has a few S.P.A. speakers outside the Assembly attending  forums,\r\n\r\nmaking fiery speeches condemning the Referendum Bill and attacking clause 29 and\r\n\r\nso  on  and  so  forth,  and  yet still have their Assemblymen  supporting  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or, if necessary, conveniently abstaining while ensuring  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would still have a majority to carry the decision, they could  easily\r\n\r\ncheat the people. The Member for Cairnhill must be very naive.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people are not so simple as to be so easily cheated. Today the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore are watching the proceedings of this Assembly and the  conduct  of\r\n\r\nevery  Member  of this Assembly is subject to public scrutiny. One  can  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech condemn the Barisan Sosialis or condemn the P.A.P.;\r\n\r\nyet  what counts is in which way he votes. The S.P.A. stereo abstaining in  this\r\n\r\nparticular  case is merely to save face because they have been openly  committed\r\n\r\nto  opposing  clause  29  of  the Bill. Here in  this  Chamber  at  the  moment,\r\n\r\nparticularly  when the Government has only 25 Members left if the  S.P.A. joins\r\n\r\nthe  rest  of  the Opposition and votes against clause 29, then clause  29  will\r\n\r\nindeed  drop,  and  the amendment to clause 29 made by the  Opposition  will  be\r\n\r\ncarried. Therefore, even for political expediency if they want to oppose  clause\r\n\r\n29,  they  cannot do it because the very survival of the Government depends  on\r\n\r\ntheir support. But then, Mr Mammen, Sir, to support clause 29 openly will be  a\r\n\r\nvery embarrassing thing because they have openly stated outside the Chamber that\r\n\r\nclause  29  is  undemocratic.  So  the obvious  thing  is  to  abstain,  and  by\r\n\r\nabstaining,  the  Government is, in fact, ensured of  a  majority  against  this\r\n\r\namendment. Sir, this is a cheap political trick and it does not take  a  man  of\r\n\r\ngreat intelligence\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto  understand  such trickery. The people of Singapore are  politically  very\r\n\r\nsophisticated indeed, and if one could have bluffed like this  in  the  past,\r\n\r\nthen the first one to try it would have been the\r\n\r\nS.P.A.  But  whatever  little effort they have made in trying  to  bluff  the\r\n\r\npeople  along similar lines has, in fact, been of no avail, and for  them  to\r\n\r\ndo  it  at  the  moment or for them to try it in the future, I  think,  would\r\n\r\nequally be fruitless.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the arguments on clause 29 have already been stated quite clearly by\r\n\r\nMembers of the Barisan Sosialis. I do not want to go into the details of  the\r\n\r\narguments except to sum up what has been said of parliamentary democracy  and\r\n\r\ndemocracy and so on in this Chamber. As I said when I started off, it is  not\r\n\r\nmy  intention to claim to be a guardian of parliamentary democracy; it is not\r\n\r\nmy  intention to claim to be a pillar of parliamentary democracy. Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  an exponent in these matters. Perhaps the Minister for Finance who  says\r\n\r\nthat  his  life is dedicated to preserving the democratic system could  be  a\r\n\r\ngreater exponent. But then as I have said.\r\n\r\nthe  tragedy of the Minister for Finance is that he is more an economist  and  a\r\n\r\ntheoretician  and, therefore, every time he thinks of political  problems  he\r\n\r\ncannot  divorce them from the ABC of economics that he has learnt; and  every\r\n\r\ntime he talks theoretically on a political basis he forgets conveniently  the\r\n\r\npractical side. Sir, I wish to just answer one or two points on this talk  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy and parliamentary democracy and so\r\n\r\non.  Sir, the Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for  Education have all said that democracy must be adapted  to  suit\r\n\r\nlocal conditions. Their suggestion has been, in fact, that democracy must  be\r\n\r\naccepted  conditionally. Sir, we know the sort of democracy that prevails  in Singapore.  We are not talking of individual rights to go to the cabaret  and\r\n\r\ndance,  to  go  to  a bar and have a beer. We are talking of the  fundamental\r\n\r\nhuman  right of the people to decide their future themselves. We  are  saying\r\n\r\nthat  merger  is a matter that will affect the lives of all our people,  that\r\n\r\nit will affect the lives of all\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntheir  children  and generations to come, and we say that in a  matter  of  this\r\n\r\nmagnitude  and  of this significance, the right of the people to  freely  choose\r\n\r\nmust be guaranteed by whatever legislation this House passes and not be deprived\r\n\r\nof consciously. Sir, the Minister for Finance has also said that in a regimented\r\n\r\nsociety  there is no talk of the right to say no, etc. I do not think, Sir,  any\r\n\r\nMember  from the Barisan Sosialis has ever suggested that the P.A.P. must  bring\r\n\r\nabout  a  regimented  society. I do not know what  particular  society  or  what\r\n\r\npolitical  system he was having in his mind when he was talking of a  regimented\r\n\r\nsociety. But knowing his inner thinking, I think it will be safe to assume  that\r\n\r\nby  a  regimented society perhaps he means a Communist society or a  society  as\r\n\r\nexisted  in Nazi Germany. Sir, I just briefly want to say this, that even  in  a\r\n\r\nCommunist society, in Communist China and in the Soviet Union, the right of  the\r\n\r\npeople to say 'no' is guaranteed in an election, and this I am sure will be ipse\r\n\r\ndixit,  if  the Members on the opposite benches choose to be honest, they  will\r\n\r\naccept.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> That is what you said.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, we are not advocating a regimented type of society.

Sir, as I have said, we are aware  of  the\r\n\r\ntype  of  democracy that has been in existence in Singapore  for  the  past  130\r\n\r\nyears. We are fully aware of the type of democracy the P.A.P. wants to practise.\r\n\r\nWe  are not, as I have said, thinking of the individual right to go to attend  a\r\n\r\nsocial here or a social there.

This is what Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the then Member for Tanjong Pagar,\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But we either believe in democracy or we do not. If we do, then we must say\r\n\r\ncategorically,  without  qualification, that no restraint  from  any  democratic\r\n\r\nprocess, other than the ordinary law of the land, should be allowed. If a man\r\n\r\nchooses  to carry a hand grenade or a revolver, or some other lethal weapon,  in\r\n\r\ntimes when the Governor and the High Commissioner have proclaimed a statement of\r\n\r\nemergency, then he takes the supreme penalty the law has laid down for him.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if a political party wants to hold at election meeting or even a post-election meeting after 7 o'clock, they are told: \"We do not believe in democracy\r\n\r\nafter  the  election. We only believe in democracy once in four years,  for  one\r\n\r\nmonth.\"  That  is not the kind of democracy that you can inspire  men  with,  to\r\n\r\nfight  for and die for. That is not the kind of democracy that is going to  make\r\n\r\nit  tick in South-East Asia, if you tell us that we can hold a public meeting in\r\n\r\nthe  heat of the sun at four o'clock or five o'clock when nobody would  come  to\r\n\r\nlisten  to  us,  when therefore there would be no real danger of any  democratic\r\n\r\nmovement  starting, but that we cannot hold a public meeting  after  7  o'clock.\r\n\r\nwhen  by the habits of the workers they would have returned from work, the earth\r\n\r\nhas  got cooler, the walls have got cooler, the night is getting mellow and warm\r\n\r\nspeeches  can  be made. But, no! That is not allowed. And yet, we are  asked  to\r\n\r\nbelieve that this is democracy.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even today the P.A.P. does not allow Opposition Parties to hold meetings\r\n\r\nafter  7 o'clock. In 1955 the Prime Minister criticised the Labour Front  Govern\r\n\r\nment for not allowing the P.A.P. to hold meetings after 7 o'clock. And today, we\r\n\r\nare  not only denied the right to hold meetings after 7 p.m. but also the  right\r\n\r\nto hold meetings where we choose to hold.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at col. 60 there is one line - Mr Lee Kuan Yew again:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nAnd one more line in continuation:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If you believe that men should be free,\r\n\r\nthen  they  should have the right of free association, of free speech,  of  free\r\n\r\npublication...'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if Members in the Government\r\n\r\nBenches  make  it  a point at least to try and read up their master,  then  they\r\n\r\nwould  not come here and say that we are dangerous elements and that we want  to\r\n\r\nwreck democracy because we ask for a fundamental right of the people - a right  to\r\n\r\nfreely say yes or no or abstain.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are told that Government thinks it necessary to have clause 29 because\r\n\r\nthe Communists want to wreck merger.\r\n\r\nI ask the Government Members: why do\r\n\r\nthe people whom the Government call Communists want to wreck merger, and why  do\r\n\r\nthey want to frustrate merger?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already dealt with this before. As far as the Barisan Sosialis are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  if  a simple question is posed to the people and if the  people  are\r\n\r\ngiven a free choice for them to freely decide whether they want to accept merger\r\n\r\non  whatever  terms, then there is no need for anybody to go  round  frustrating\r\n\r\nmerger of one type or another.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is because today the Government has clearly stated that it wants to\r\n\r\npose  two  totally  unacceptable alternatives,  and  it  is  because  today  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  stated clearly that it wants to have blank  votes  recorded  as\r\n\r\nvotes  for  the  Government proposition that there is  this  resistance  to  the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill.  If  it  were not for that, the Barisan  Sosialis  would  have\r\n\r\nnothing against merger in principle, or the Referendum Bill in principle, and we\r\n\r\nwould  have  no necessity to go round canvassing people to vote one way  or  the\r\n\r\nother.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are told that clause 29 is necessary because of the Communists. We are\r\n\r\ntold that it is necessary to deprive the people of the fundamental right to have\r\n\r\nfree  choice because of people whom they call Communists. Sir, we are  seriously\r\n\r\nasked  to  believe that over 600,000 voters are going to be denied the right  to\r\n\r\nfreely accept, reject, or abstain from any proposition\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbecause  of the Communists. In brief, what we are  told  is  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  should not have democracy because there are Communists and,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nalready said a number of times in this House, and the Prime Minister himself has\r\n\r\nalso  said, there are only 300 Communists in Singapore. In other words,  on  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. logic, because there are 300 dangerous Communists the 1.7 million people\r\n\r\nare to be denied their fundamental democratic right.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to end by again quoting the great exponent of democracy, the great\r\n\r\nexponent of parliamentary democracy - the Prime Minister himself.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> You were his good student.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was never a good student, but I got facts.

Listening to the Member for Anson, whose  belief  in\r\n\r\ndemocracy nobody has ever doubted ever since he got into politics, there is this\r\n\r\nreassurance although some might say that others who are more adept at  political\r\n\r\nmachinations  sometimes use him. But so far as the Member for Anson  himself  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  nobody can doubt, nobody has doubted, and I hope  nobody  will  ever\r\n\r\ndoubt,  his entire belief in and support of the democratic creed, faith  and  in\r\n\r\nthe particular form in which we try to administer democracy in this country. But\r\n\r\nof  the  others, there have been serious doubts, and listening to today's debate\r\n\r\none  is seriously tempted to believe that whatever doubts one might have had are\r\n\r\nall misconceived.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear, Mr Speaker, that the basic objection to clause 29 is this:\r\n\r\nthat  the fundamental inalienable right of every democratic citizen to say  \"no\"\r\n\r\nto  any  proposition has been denied, and that this clause seeks  to  deny  that\r\n\r\nfundamental  inherent right which every citizen in a democracy  should  possess.\r\n\r\nNow,  while  subscribing to that theory, I wonder whether in every  circumstance\r\n\r\nand  in  every  manifestation  of the democratic  workings  of  a  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  that is always so. Democracy is practised in Europe, in  Canada,  in\r\n\r\nAustralia, and in various parts of the world. In the United Kingdom, where I was\r\n\r\nabout   a  month  ago,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  had  the  opportunity  to   meet\r\n\r\nParliamentarians  from the House of Commons who are not quite so  familiar  with\r\n\r\nthe  workings of democracy in our country. When I mentioned to one of them  that\r\n\r\nin Singapore it was not merely a question of a right to vote but a duty to vote,\r\n\r\nthat  the  right  to  vote  in  Singapore has been converted  into  a  duty,  an\r\n\r\ninescapable duty\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto  vote he was horrified. \"Oh, that is not right,\" he said. \"How could  you  do\r\n\r\nthat?  How  could you force anybody to go to the polls if he does not want  to?\"\r\n\r\nThat is a point of view, Mr Speaker, which has to be respected. And perhaps  in\r\n\r\nthe  context  of parliamentary democracy in the United Kingdom, it  is  correct.\r\n\r\nNow,  no  Member of the United Kingdom Parliament could say that the  Australian\r\n\r\nParliamentarians  are less democratic than the United Kingdom  Parliamentarians.\r\n\r\nAnd  yet in Australia the right to vote has been converted into a duty to  vote.\r\n\r\nAnd  we here in Singapore started off by saying that there could only be a right\r\n\r\nto  vote  and not a duty to vote. Now, because of the political conditions  that\r\n\r\nprevail  here and of the various reasons which, if not looked after, would  have\r\n\r\nwrecked  the  parliamentary democratic system, the right to vote  was  converted\r\n\r\ninto  a  duty to vote. I mention this, Mr Speaker, Sir, to show that  sometimes\r\n\r\nwhat  one  conceives  to  be  a democratic right has  to  be  converted  into  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic duty in order to save the democratic system.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a duty, Mr Speaker. Sir, then\r\n\r\nno  question  of  a right to abstain arises. You simply have to do  it,  because\r\n\r\nsociety  in  its own interest has decreed that to preserve itself  each  citizen\r\n\r\nmust be called upon to do certain things. In those circumstances, it is right to\r\n\r\nimpose  a  duty on each citizen, and if that citizen does not perform the  duty,\r\n\r\nthen  he has to pay the consequences. Now this is one instance which I can  cite\r\n\r\nto the Member for Thomson where a right has been converted into a duty.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite another case to the learned Member for Anson. I think this would\r\n\r\nappeal  to  him. Jury service, Mr Speaker, Sir, It is the right of every  adult\r\n\r\ncitizen  in the United Kingdom to serve on a jury. When he is called  for  jury\r\n\r\nservice,  that  right is converted into a duty. He has to do it, unless  he  has\r\n\r\nvery  good  reasons. He cannot, when he is called upon by the Registrar  of  the\r\n\r\nCourt  to  serve as a juror, say, \"No, no, I do not want to serve.\" If  he  does\r\n\r\nthat,  then he has to pay the penalty. If he is chosen as a member of  the  jury\r\n\r\nand sits on the jury,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nand the Judge poses certain questions to the members of the jury q uestion  A,\r\n\r\nquestion  B,  question C; all facts are in the hands of the jury - it  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  inalienable right of the juryman to say, \"I do not know. I  cannot  make\r\n\r\nup  my  mind.\"  He  has  to make up his mind one way  or  the  other  on  the\r\n\r\nquestions  that are posed to him. That is his duty. If the jury  return,  and\r\n\r\nthe  foreman of the jury tells the Judge, \"None of us have been able to  make\r\n\r\nup  our  minds on the questions that have been posed to us,\" .the Judge  will\r\n\r\nsend them back until such time as they have made up their minds. If they  are\r\n\r\ndifficult,  the  jury will be dismissed and another jury will  be  empanelled\r\n\r\nand the same questions will be posed to them until the answers are given.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I see the situation in this light. An attempt has been\r\n\r\nmade  by Members of the Barisan Sosialis and by the Member for Anson to  draw\r\n\r\nan  analogy between an election and a referendum. It is contended, and  quite\r\n\r\nrightly,  that  in an election the citizens have the right to  cast  a  blank\r\n\r\nballot  paper. Mr Speaker, Sir, in my contention, this is a:; it should  be,\r\n\r\nbecause the manner in which the ballot paper is devised, the\r\n\r\nmanner  in which the elector is called upon to cast his vote is such that he can\r\n\r\nonly  say  \"no\"  to a candidate or by saying \"yes\" to another  candidate.  If\r\n\r\nthere  are four candidates, and if an elector wants to say \"no\" to every  one\r\n\r\nof  the  four  candidates, he does so by putting in a blank ballot  paper  to\r\n\r\nshow   that  he  does  not  like  any  of  the  four  candidates.  In   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances, it is his right to reject all four candidates.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the position the same in a referendum? A referendum, to my mind, is an\r\n\r\nentirely different matter. It is on a matter of grave national importance  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the Government go to the electorate. The government of the day  cannot\r\n\r\nmake  up  its mind. Although it might have ideas about a matter,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nquite  sure  of  public reaction. Therefore, it might  on  its  own  put  the\r\n\r\nquestions to the electorate. And again it might come to the Assembly  or  the\r\n\r\nHouse, as the case may be, and consult it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let us now therefore come nearer home on the question of merger with the Federation. As far as I can make out, no single individual in Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  or  does  in fact deny that there should be merger with the Federation.  No\r\n\r\nsingle  individual has denied that this merger should be brought  about  at  the\r\n\r\nquickest  possible  opportunity.  We might  each  of  us  or  some  of  us  have\r\n\r\ndifferences  of opinion as to the type of merger, or if I may put it  that  way,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, on the quantum of merger. But on the basic and vital question\r\n\r\nwhether  there  should be merger with the Federation there is no  difference  of\r\n\r\nopinion  at  all. In those circumstances. I ask the Member for Thomson  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson to try and look at this, for the moment at least, objectively.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Member  for Thomson will bear with me for a moment,  his  objection  to\r\n\r\nclause  29,  Mr Speaker, is, it seems to me, a completely objective  one:  that\r\n\r\nthis  clause 29 is not democratic. Never mind the purposes to which it is  being\r\n\r\nput. But the clause in itself is undemocratic and as such unacceptable. That  is\r\n\r\nhis argument. His basic objection to this clause is this. I have listened to the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson with great interest. Time and again he said this: 'If  there\r\n\r\nare  unacceptable alternatives posed, then there will be blank votes.' In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  he  is  suggesting that if the alternatives posed to the electorate  are\r\n\r\nunacceptable, then this clause becomes undemocratic, because it then denies  the\r\n\r\nright of the voter to say \"No\" to all the unacceptable alternatives. Now, I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Thomson  in all seriousness: if it  were  possible  to  devise\r\n\r\nacceptable alternatives \r\n\r\n- I  repeat it again - if it were possible to devise acceptable alternatives, would\r\n\r\nthe objection to clause 29 disappear on the arguments-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I think we have made\r\n\r\nit  very  clear that whether there is to be one question, two questions  or  two\r\n\r\nalternatives or two unacceptable alternatives, the right to say \"yes\" or \"no\" or\r\n\r\nto  abstain  must be there. We have stated quite clearly that the  objection  is\r\n\r\nbecause, in the first place, the extent of choice is limited, and, in the second\r\n\r\nplace, the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nright  of  free  choice is interfered with by clause 29. Our  objection  to\r\n\r\nthat  clause  is  not just because there are going to be  two  unacceptable\r\n\r\nalternatives.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I believe the Member for Thomson and I are getting\r\n\r\ncloser\r\n\r\nto each other on this particular issue.\r\n\r\nI  think  we  are nearing the point of agreement on this particular  issue,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nif  not  on  the  other issues. On this particular issue of clause  29,  it\r\n\r\nappears that\r\n\r\nwe  are  getting closer to understanding each other than was  possible  two\r\n\r\ndays  ago. It seems, therefore, that if it were possible by some  skill  to\r\n\r\ndevise  some  acceptable  alternatives, then it appears  to  me  that  the\r\n\r\nobjections,  of  the Member for Thomson at least - I do not  know  about  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown - but certainly those of the Member for Thomson  would\r\n\r\nappear not to be so violent-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Clause 29 - what\r\n\r\nwill come of it?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you see the difficulties we get into.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  this  perpetual contest between the  P.A.P. and  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  nothing  is ever looked at objectively or  on  its  merits.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis are asking, what is behind clause 29? And the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nasking,  what  is behind the Barisan amendment?

He attacked  my  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Cairnhill, as being somewhat Machiavellian in his  speech.\r\n\r\nHe  also  attacked the Singapore People's Alliance for what they  had  said\r\n\r\noutside  this Assembly in its attack on clause 29 and what the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhas now said vis-a-vis clause 29. Perhaps the Member for Thomson will forgive me\r\n\r\nif  I  use  his own argument. Once the Member for Thomson is satisfied that  the\r\n\r\nquestions posed are acceptable, then the objections to clause 29, from  his  own\r\n\r\npoint of view, disappear. Now, if that were correct in his own case, I think  he\r\n\r\nshould  concede  that  that  should be correct even with  the  S.P.A.  What  the\r\n\r\nSingapore People's Alliance were worried about a week ago or before this  debate\r\n\r\ncommenced  was whether the questions that were to be posed would be  brought  to\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly and whether, in the view of the Singapore People's Alliance,  the\r\n\r\nquestions  would  be fair and reasonable. If, in the opinion  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPeople's Alliance, the questions were exhaustive, fair and reasonable, naturally\r\n\r\ntheir  objections to clause 29 would disappear, in the same way as the objection\r\n\r\nof the Member for Thomson to the clause would disappear. So why then-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

If the arguments are\r\n\r\ncogent  so far as he is concerned, I think the same argument must logically  and\r\n\r\nreasonably apply to us. That is the situation in which we find ourselves  today.\r\n\r\nThe  Government have now made a statement - in fact, they have put in a  motion - to\r\n\r\nthe  effect that they are going to pose two alternatives. I think the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  has given notice that he thinks a third one should be posed.  At  the\r\n\r\nappropriate time, Mr Speaker, Sir, we will move the amendment to the motion. We\r\n\r\nhope  that the Government will accept it. If the Government accept that  motion,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  point  of view of the Singapore People's Alliance, all  the  possible\r\n\r\nacceptable  alternatives which should go to the electorate  will  be  there.  It\r\n\r\ncould  be  that  from  the  Barisan Sosialis point  of  view  it  might  not  be\r\n\r\nacceptable. Then it is up to them to pose the alternatives\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwhich they think are acceptable. If all the possible alternatives that could  be\r\n\r\nagreed upon by the Assembly are then posed to the electorate, then I do not  see\r\n\r\nwhy the electorate should not answer \"yes\" to one of the questions posed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He is not allowed to.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If all the possible acceptable alternatives have been posed, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir  -  I would remind the Member for Anson of this  phrase  which  is\r\n\r\nfamiliar  to all of us - we have to cater for a reasonable man, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nnot to a weak and vacillating man that cannot make up his mind. That is all that\r\n\r\none  can reasonably be expected to do. The questions must be posed in such a way\r\n\r\nthat a reasonable man will understand them and will not be puzzled by them. That\r\n\r\nis  all  the  obligation  that exists on the person who poses  any  question  or\r\n\r\nquestions.  If the questions are posed in that reasonable manner,  three,  four,\r\n\r\nfive  or  six - as many as the Assembly thinks are necessary - and if those are  the\r\n\r\nonly  possible alternatives to this question of merger, surely there can he  and\r\n\r\nmust  be one answer. There cannot be six \"noes\", Mr Speaker, Sir, It could then\r\n\r\nbe  completely unreasonable. That is assuming that the six possible alternatives\r\n\r\nhave  been posed. If the only possible alternatives have been posed, surely  one\r\n\r\nmust be in a position to answer.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Mr Speaker, Sir, is as I see the problem. I do not say that this should\r\n\r\nnormally apply in every referendum. But in this particular referendum we are  in\r\n\r\nthe  happy position of all political Parties and all Singaporeans saying we must\r\n\r\nhave  merger. For if we had not reached this position, a solution by  way  of  a\r\n\r\nreferendum might have been extremely difficult, because then you would have  had\r\n\r\nto  pose  the  different  types of association which one  could  want  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation.

So\r\n\r\nhaving agreed that merger is the base to which we all are firmly anchored,  from\r\n\r\nthat  base we then go on to all the possible acceptable alternatives which could\r\n\r\nbe  put;  and  if  all such possible alternatives are put, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nmyself, as a reasonable man, do not see why one of those should not be picked.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I intend to be brief. But I cannot let the impression of undoubted ability in advocacy give one a completely false view of the\r\n\r\nbasic facts. We have witnessed an exquisite piece of special pleading done  with\r\n\r\ncharm,  if I may say so with respect, Sir. Now, let us come to the meat of  what\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Farrer Park says. He says that when the right to vote becomes  a\r\n\r\nduty  to  vote, then the right to abstain ceases to exist. Fortunately, Sir,  he\r\n\r\nsaw the fallacy of it and tried to cover up what he knows are the provisions  of\r\n\r\nsection 41, subsection (1) of the Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance which\r\n\r\nprovide,  in the words of his own leader, the Member for Cairnhill,  though  you\r\n\r\nare compelled to go to the booth you are not required to mark your voting paper.\r\n\r\nThat  is  nothing  illegal or improper. He says he does  recognise  that  in  an\r\n\r\nelection  there  is a right to reject because you are only given  four  or  five\r\n\r\nalternative  candidates. Then he refers us to a jury. Here, if you  will  permit\r\n\r\nme,  Mr  Speaker, he says in a jury, the jurymen have no right  to  abstain.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to tell you a little story, and a perfectly true one. Around the year\r\n\r\n1934, the first and only time that I served as a juror, I happened to be foreman\r\n\r\nof  the jury in a case of acid throwing where the accused had thrown acid on his\r\n\r\nwife's lover and burnt his nose and his fingers. Well, we got into the jury room\r\n\r\nand  I said, \"It should be very simple. Are we all agreed he is guilty?\" and one\r\n\r\nman  started  on a religious track. It sounded like a religious track,  Sir.  He\r\n\r\nsaid, \"The Lord sayeth, 'Judge not and thou shall not be judged,' and it is  not\r\n\r\nfor us to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\njudge.\"  I  got rather angry about that and I said, \"You are on the  jury.\"\r\n\r\nSo  I  went back to the court and asked of the Judge what was I to do with\r\n\r\nthis  person's vote? How would I record him, because he had not said  'aye'\r\n\r\nand  he had not said 'nay'. The direction of the Court was that where there\r\n\r\nwas  a  juror who refused to come down on the side of \"guilty\" he  must  be\r\n\r\ndeemed to be voting \"not guilty\". That was the only\r\n\r\njury on which I served, and that was a case of a man who refused to vote because\r\n\r\nit  turned out he had religious scruples - 'Judge not, and thou shall not  be\r\n\r\njudged.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park pleaded that we should look at this clause\r\n\r\nobjectively.  By  all  means,  Sir.  He  says  that  if  all  the  acceptable\r\n\r\nalternatives  could  possibly be posed after having  been  debated  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  then objectively is it not right? If the voter having heard  all\r\n\r\nthe  possible alternatives discussed in the Assembly, having understood all\r\n\r\nthe  alternatives, does not want any of them, that is  why  he  puts  in  a\r\n\r\nblank  paper,  and to suggest - and this is what the Member for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nglossed  over - that after having heard all the arguments,  and  particularly\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  arguments, when a man casts a blank paper  it  shall  be\r\n\r\ndeemed  to  be  in  favour  of the Government, that  is  the  crux  of  the\r\n\r\ndishonesty; because, forgive me for making a very short repetition,  if  he\r\n\r\ndid  want the Government proposal, there was nothing simpler than  to  mark\r\n\r\nhis  cross  against  it, or if he is not allowed a cross,  to  do  whatever\r\n\r\ntortuous act the Government seeks that we should do.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a great deal of merit in the Member for Hong Lim's\r\n\r\nproposal  that those who cast blank papers shall be deemed to be  unwilling\r\n\r\nto  accept;  it  goes against the grain for me though  to  permit  a  blank\r\n\r\npaper, however unusual the circumstances, to have any value at all. If  you\r\n\r\nwill  see  my  amendment,  I  have  said  that  the  proposals  are  either\r\n\r\nunacceptable  or  he  does not understand the instructions.  Because,  Sir,\r\n\r\nnowhere in the world, and that is one of the answers to the Member for\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nFarrer Park, nowhere in any of the legislation into which we have researched \r\n\r\n- and we have ransacked the legislation of some 13 countries, Sir; - we have sought\r\n\r\nand  obtained  the  assistance of the Diplomatic Corps to  a  very  considerable\r\n\r\nextent - can you find a provision like this clause which permits the Government to\r\n\r\nreap votes which are cast because they do not want the proposals that are before\r\n\r\nthem, in essence, although some of them, because of their ignorance, may well be\r\n\r\nunaware of the exact means of voting. It is not a question, as the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Prime Minister has said, of a child who does not know  whether\r\n\r\nhe wants meat and does not know whether he wants fish and so he says, \"Papa, you\r\n\r\ndecide  for me.\" That is fair enough. But here he has heard the virtues of  meat\r\n\r\nextolled,  the virtues of fish extolled, and he could have chosen. But  he  does\r\n\r\nnot  want either, Sir. Maybe he is an incipient vegetarian. That is the  answer.\r\n\r\nNow,  in  order to make his very smooth argument to cover the unhappy volte-face\r\n\r\nof  the S.P.A. from their vigorous and manly words in Select Committee, when  we\r\n\r\nhad  the Member for Cairnhill fighting shoulder to shoulder with us in the cause\r\n\r\nof  decency,  and  their  present incapacity to make up their  minds  they  will\r\n\r\nabstain.  There is a delightful book by Peter Ustinov in which he  ticks  off  a\r\n\r\nRussian diplomat. He says, \"I am in two minds - one mind says 'yes' and the  other\r\n\r\nmind  says 'no', and the two minds are equally strong and in between I abstain.\"\r\n\r\nThis  responsible Party of strong-minded, public-spirited gentlemen and lady - and\r\n\r\nin  fairness to the lady, I would say that I have, in fact, found her very often\r\n\r\non the side of fairness and decency - but let us go on to the boast of the leader\r\n\r\nof  this Party. He says they are a responsible Party. His colleague says this is\r\n\r\na  very good clause. He himself voted against it and now I understand the entire\r\n\r\nParty is going to abstain. I cannot but express deep regret that in the field of\r\n\r\npolitics  we should have these changes which confuse the public image.  However,\r\n\r\nto go back to the merits. May I remind the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n-     the Prime Minister being present; it is all the more appropriate - that  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has repeatedly told us that if we ask each individual  voter  of\r\n\r\nthe  624,000  voters  in Singapore what kind of merger he  wants,  we  will  get\r\n\r\n624,000 different types of merger. According to the Prime Minister himself,  not\r\n\r\none or two or three or four. So if we are to get 624,000 types of merger and  it\r\n\r\nis  hardly  appropriate  for us to conceive or attempt to  conceive  of  a  plan\r\n\r\nwhereby all these types can be put to the electorate, is it not fair to leave  a\r\n\r\nprovision  whereby they can say yes or no? That is the crux,  that  having  been\r\n\r\ndefeated,  all  the  rest is sham. But it is more than sham here  it  is  parti\r\n\r\ncularly horrible, Sir, because if in fact the questions have been discussed  and\r\n\r\ndecided  in the Assembly, the voter should know whether he wants it, and  if  he\r\n\r\nwants it he can vote for it. But the Member for Farrer Park refuses to face  it.\r\n\r\nHe  says that in putting blank papers in, the majority of those voters, in fact,\r\n\r\nare  saying,  \"We do not like these options.\" \"Where is the logic  of  it?\",  he\r\n\r\nasks.  Now,  let us look at the two questions posed by the Prime  Minister.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park says that if all the acceptable alternatives are  put - it\r\n\r\nis  a  very  large  \"if\"; if we count all the grains of sand in  the  world - what\r\n\r\nobjection  can there be? But here we have got two already. Will the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  not recognise that the way they are posed leaves  a  very  unhappy\r\n\r\nlacuna and leaves the question open as to what those alternatives\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmean?  We  have had one alternative - the P.A.P. proposals - spelt  out,  but  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister respelt it out by putting in education and labour. Then we  have\r\n\r\nhad  another  proposal which is as a constituent State under the  constitutional\r\n\r\ndocuments - whatever that might mean \r\n\r\n- but  it  leaves  completely blank the issue as to citizenship,  it  leaves  completely unfilled the picture. The Member for Farrer Park must be conscious  that\r\n\r\nif  questions  are  posed  in  a manner where different  people  may  understand\r\n\r\ndifferent things, that question is not acceptable and can never be acceptable. I\r\n\r\nwill  say, Sir, that if, in fact, there is precision in the amendment to the  motion  \r\n\r\nsuggested  by the Member for Cairnhill, he will have my  support  that  a\r\n\r\nfurther  proposal  will be as indicated by the Member for  Cairnhill,  that  the\r\n\r\nterms should be no less favourable-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
