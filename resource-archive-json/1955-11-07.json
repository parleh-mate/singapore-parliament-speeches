It  has  now arrived in the  Assembly.  The\r\n\r\nObjects  and Reasons state fairly clearly what  it\r\n\r\nis  all  about, but there have been some  comments\r\n\r\nsince  it  came  before the public,  and  I  think\r\n\r\nMembers may expect me to give some explanation why\r\n\r\na  reduction is proposed for the minimum  age  for\r\n\r\ndrivers of motor vehicles and motor cycles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present minimum age of 19 for a driver of a\r\n\r\nmotor car is high by the standards existing in any\r\n\r\nof  the civilized and progressive countries of the\r\n\r\nworld,  many  of which have traffic problems  much\r\n\r\nmore  serious than our own. As far as I am  aware,\r\n\r\nthere  is no minimum age laid down for drivers  by\r\n\r\nany international body, but it is significant that\r\n\r\na  United  Nations conference on  road  and  motor\r\n\r\ntransport,   which   met  in   Geneva   in   1949,\r\n\r\nrecommended  that, for purposes  of  international\r\n\r\ntraffic,  States  should  recognise  the   driving\r\n\r\npermits  of other countries, subject to a  minimum\r\n\r\nage  of 18 years, or a lower age if they so  wish.\r\n\r\nYou  will note, of course, that this means that  a\r\n\r\ndriver,  who has been licensed to drive,  say,  on\r\n\r\nthe left-hand side of the road, can, at the age of\r\n\r\n18,  go  and drive on what is to him on the  wrong\r\n\r\nside  of  the road in France. It assumes that  the\r\n\r\ndriver is not merely capable of driving in his own\r\n\r\ncountry,  but  driving in any other country  where\r\n\r\nthere is a somewhat different traffic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our own International Circulation Motor\r\n\r\nVehicle  Rules,  we provide that an  international\r\n\r\ndriving permit can be granted to a person  at  the\r\n\r\nage  of  18. You thus have the anomalous situation\r\n\r\nwhere  we  will  license somebody to  drive  in  a\r\n\r\nforeign country, yet we refuse to license  him  to\r\n\r\ndrive  in our own country. The Objects and Reasons\r\n\r\nof the Bill state that the age of 19 is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunnecessarily  high and that, by reducing  it,  we\r\n\r\nwill  come  into line with the United Kingdom  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, where the ages are 17  for  motor\r\n\r\ncars and 16 for motor cycles. There is no absolute\r\n\r\nneed  for  Singapore to do what  is  done  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  but  it  is very  advisable  that  we\r\n\r\nshould,  wherever possible, keep closely  in  step\r\n\r\nwith them. It is also not wholly necessary to keep\r\n\r\nin  step with the United Kingdom, but you  do  get\r\n\r\nquite   a  number  of  people  coming  from   both\r\n\r\nterritories  to Singapore. In fact,  at  the  very\r\n\r\nfirst  \"Meet-the-people\" session  that  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister had, he received a complaint or a request\r\n\r\nfrom  a  young  person who was licensed  to  drive\r\n\r\nelsewhere  but  was restricted in Singapore.  This\r\n\r\nquestion  of people coming from the Federation  or\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom is not a major question. There\r\n\r\nare really much more serious reasons why we should\r\n\r\nat least keep in line with the Federation, because\r\n\r\nboth  territories recognise each  other's  driving\r\n\r\npermits,  and it is most necessary and  convenient\r\n\r\nthat  drivers,  who  do have to  pass  across  the\r\n\r\ncauseway  from one territory to the other,  should\r\n\r\nbe   able  to  pass  freely  without  a   lot   of\r\n\r\nunnecessary restrictions. At present,  the  effect\r\n\r\nis  that  a  17-year old or an 18-year old  driver\r\n\r\nfrom  Johore  Bahru, or even from Kota  Bahru  for\r\n\r\nthat  matter, can, in practice, drive his car into\r\n\r\nSingapore  and drive all round the place  and  out\r\n\r\nagain,  whilst  our  own boys and  girls  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  drive on the roads.  It  seems  again\r\n\r\nquite anomalous and unfair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation lowered their ages for driving\r\n\r\nway  back  in 1950, and they seem to have  got  on\r\n\r\nvery  happily  with it. Since we  have  reciprocal\r\n\r\nrecognition  of driving licences, it is  desirable\r\n\r\nthat  we should keep in step. I am sure there will\r\n\r\nbe  no  difficulty in keeping in step, because  we\r\n\r\nhave  such  very happy and cordial relations  with\r\n\r\nthe Ministers in Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other objections have been raised - and I am\r\n\r\ndealing  with all these now so that  we  can  save\r\n\r\ntime when we get to the Committee stage - about  the\r\n\r\nage limit. It is said that our roads are in -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconveniently crowded. There are too many  cars  on\r\n\r\nthem  and  therefore  we should  not  allow  young\r\n\r\npeople  to  drive,  and  that  only  the  old  and\r\n\r\nexperienced be allowed to get on to the  roads.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think that is at all a fair  attitude  to\r\n\r\ntake.  If  the  roads are over-crowded,  then  the\r\n\r\nsolution  is probably to reduce the size of  cars,\r\n\r\nand  allow only small cars on the roads. This will\r\n\r\ncreate much more space than possibly can be  taken\r\n\r\nup  by an increase in the number of younger people\r\n\r\non  the  roads. The fact is, of course,  that  our\r\n\r\ntraffic is heavy, but it is nowhere near as  heavy\r\n\r\nas  in central London or in New York. We know that\r\n\r\nin  America  they have one car  for  every  three\r\n\r\npersons,  and  Singapore  is  nowhere  near   that\r\n\r\nstandard  yet.  In places where they  have  really\r\n\r\ndifficult  traffic  problems, there  have  been  a\r\n\r\nnumber of proposals on how to improve the flow  of\r\n\r\ntraffic  on  the  roads, but no  one  has  so  far\r\n\r\nsuggested  that you should discriminate against  a\r\n\r\ncertain  age  group and say that just because  you\r\n\r\nhave  not  reached this particular age, you  shall\r\n\r\nnot  be allowed on the roads. The solution, if you\r\n\r\nare  going to take an age group off, will probably\r\n\r\nbe  to  take the old people off and not the  young\r\n\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there still remains another argument,\r\n\r\nand that is, that the young people, if they get on\r\n\r\nthe  roads, will be reckless and dangerous drivers\r\n\r\nand  cause innumerable accidents, speeding around,\r\n\r\nas  one newspaper puts it, in cars which have been\r\n\r\ngiven them by their millionaire parents. The  fact\r\n\r\nis  that  Singapore  boys and girls  are  just  as\r\n\r\nsensible   and  responsible  as  boys  and   girls\r\n\r\nanywhere else. There is no reason to suppose  that\r\n\r\nthey  are going to go mad on the roads when people\r\n\r\nof   the  same  age  in  the  Federation  do   not\r\n\r\nmisbehave,  nor  do the young  men  and  women  in\r\n\r\nEngland  misbehave. This is based, I think,  on  a\r\n\r\nmisapprehension on the part of the people who have\r\n\r\nraised  this objection about dangerous driving  by\r\n\r\nthose  who are young. There is no evidence at  all\r\n\r\nto  show that young drivers in Singapore are  more\r\n\r\ndangerous than those that are older. In fact,  the\r\n\r\nevidence  that  I have been able to get  indicates\r\n\r\nexactly the opposite. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave had the accident figures for September broken\r\n\r\ndown,  and they reveal that the number of  drivers\r\n\r\nat  the age of 19, 20 or 21, who were involved  in\r\n\r\naccidents,  is  very considerably  less  than  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  drivers who are aged  22  to  30.  The\r\n\r\nactual peaks of accidents come at the ages of  24,\r\n\r\n30 and 35. These are the three peaks in the graph.\r\n\r\nOf course, the significance of that figure depends\r\n\r\non  how many young people are actually driving  at\r\n\r\nthe ages of 19 to 21. I have not got exact figures\r\n\r\nof how many there are, but that age group accounts\r\n\r\nfor  more than 50 per cent of the applications for\r\n\r\ndriving  licences. It is fair to  say  that  there\r\n\r\nmust  already  be a considerable number  of  these\r\n\r\nrelatively young people at the age of 19, and they\r\n\r\ndo  not account for a large part of the accidents.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, it is much more likely that young men or\r\n\r\nyoung  women will be better at avoiding  accidents\r\n\r\nbecause  their  reflexes  are  quicker  and  their\r\n\r\npowers  of  observation and attention  are  better\r\n\r\nthan those of elderly drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, of course, licences are not given to\r\n\r\npeople  without proper testing. They are  required\r\n\r\nto  pass their test and about 50 per cent of  them\r\n\r\nare failed, so that these young men and women will\r\n\r\nhave  to learn their traffic code and learn  their\r\n\r\ndriving  very  carefully, because  otherwise  they\r\n\r\nwill not get their licences from the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that somebody will wish to query the\r\n\r\namendment   dealing   with   the   provision   for\r\n\r\ncompounding of offences. That comes under section\r\n\r\n82 of the Ordinance. The situation here is that  a\r\n\r\nvery  large  and increasing number  of  offers  of\r\n\r\ncompensation are made. It was 2,600 in  September,\r\n\r\nI  think,  and  2,000 in the previous  month,  and\r\n\r\nabout  99 per cent of these were accepted  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  who committed the offences, and the amount\r\n\r\nof  money  involved was relatively  small.  It  is\r\n\r\nproper  that these offences should be  handled  by\r\n\r\npeople  below the rank of Assistant Superintendent\r\n\r\nof Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered everything that people\r\n\r\nare  likely  to  say, Mr Deputy Speaker.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nformally move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, my sympathies\r\n\r\nare   surely  with  the  Hon. the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works (Mr Thomas).  I  thought\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly would have the pleasure  of  hearing\r\n\r\napproximately the number of applicants  who  would\r\n\r\nfall  within  the age group of 17 to  19.  I  also\r\n\r\nthought, Sir, that the Minister would give  us  an\r\n\r\nidea  of  the  additional  manpower  required   to\r\n\r\ncontrol traffic in the event of this Bill becoming\r\n\r\nlaw.  I  also thought that he would bring  to  the\r\n\r\nnotice  of this Assembly various other aspects  of\r\n\r\nthe  problem involved in this amended Bill, but  I\r\n\r\nam really very disappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my own part, Sir, I would like to bring to\r\n\r\nthe  attention of this House some of  the  salient\r\n\r\npoints  arising out of this amended Bill. A person\r\n\r\napplies  for  a driving licence for one  of  three\r\n\r\nreasons. Firstly, if he is the owner of a vehicle,\r\n\r\nhe  applies for a driving licence. Secondly, if he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  own  a  vehicle, but  thinks  that  the\r\n\r\npossession  of  a  driving  licence  is  a  social\r\n\r\naccomplishment, he applies for a driving  licence.\r\n\r\nAnd,  thirdly, if he thinks that a driving licence\r\n\r\nis  an  insurance against unemployment, he applies\r\n\r\nfor a driving licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us analyse these three points individually,\r\n\r\nSir. The first one is that of a person who applies\r\n\r\nwhen he owns a motor car or motor cycle or any other\r\n\r\nvehicle,  and he is entitled to a driving licence.\r\n\r\nThe  number  of people, Sir, who come  under  this\r\n\r\ncategory will be very few and far between. Unless\r\n\r\nhe  is  the son of some millionaire, as  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  points out, there is very little  chance\r\n\r\nof his applying for a licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when he does not own a vehicle, but he\r\n\r\nthinks  that  knowing how to  drive  is  a  social\r\n\r\naccomplishment, he applies for a driving  licence.\r\n\r\nWho  are these people? The amendment gives the age\r\n\r\ngroup  as between 17 and 19. We have seen  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  roads,  Sir, traffic accidents  in  the\r\n\r\npast -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Not due to the young people!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> But we cannot forecast when an\r\n\r\naccident  can occur. There are nearly 30,000  cars\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  today, with, I think, about  10,000\r\n\r\nlorries, and a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  large  number of motor cycles.\r\n\r\nCan one imagine the sight of a teenage  boy  driving a 3-ton lorry  on\r\n\r\nthe Singapore streets? I think that\r\n\r\nwould be a very dangerous situation\r\n\r\nand  this  is the time we  have  to\r\n\r\nthink of the age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, people who apply\r\n\r\nfor   driving   licences   as    an\r\n\r\ninsurance against unemployment. Not\r\n\r\nlong ago, Sir, the President of the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Hire  Car   Association\r\n\r\napproached   our  Chief   Minister,\r\n\r\ninforming  him of the  position  of\r\n\r\npirate taxis. One of the effects of\r\n\r\nreducing  this  age limit  will  be\r\n\r\nthat in Singapore, from the day the\r\n\r\nBill  becomes law, we will  see  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of pirate taxis plying\r\n\r\nfor  hire. I do not blame  them.  I\r\n\r\nagree  that they also have to  have\r\n\r\nsome occupation. But then what I am\r\n\r\nworried about is the number of cars\r\n\r\nthat  will  be on the roads  which\r\n\r\nwill   bring  about  very   chaotic\r\n\r\nconditions  in  Singapore.  Against\r\n\r\nthis  age  limit, Sir, section  285\r\n\r\n(1)   of  the  Municipal  Ordinance\r\n\r\nclearly  states that the  Registrar\r\n\r\nof  Vehicles may grant a licence to\r\n\r\na  driver  of  a hackney  carriage,\r\n\r\nother than the first class, to  any\r\n\r\nperson above the age of 20. So,  if\r\n\r\nanybody were to think that this  is\r\n\r\nan  insurance against unemployment,\r\n\r\nthat  argument would fail. He  must\r\n\r\nbe  more than 20 years of age if he\r\n\r\nwere  to  be a taxi driver.  So  I\r\n\r\ncome to my earlier point again, and\r\n\r\nthat  is, that if he wants to  have\r\n\r\nemployment,  he can have  it  as  a\r\n\r\npirate  taxi driver, or as a driver\r\n\r\nfor  some car owner. I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether   there   will   be    many\r\n\r\nvacancies for drivers for  motor car\r\n\r\nowners.  I think there is now  more\r\n\r\nunemployment in the driver category\r\n\r\nthan  we  ever had. I  think,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis   amendment   will   be   very\r\n\r\nineffective  as  a measure  against\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, for what purpose are we\r\n\r\ngoing  to have this amendment?  The\r\n\r\nHon. Minister said that he does not\r\n\r\nwish  this  Assembly  to  become  a\r\n\r\nrubber  stamp of the Federation  or\r\n\r\nany  other  country.  He  is  quite\r\n\r\nright,  but, at the same  time,  he\r\n\r\nhas not -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Could you repeat that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> When I said the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister explained to this Assembly\r\n\r\nthat he did not intend to become  a\r\n\r\nrubber\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstamp for the Federation or, for\r\n\r\nthat matter, any other country in\r\n\r\nthe world -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

I\r\n\r\nhave   not  got  figures  for  1954\r\n\r\ntraffic  accidents and applications\r\n\r\nfor licences. The latest I have got\r\n\r\nare  1953 figures. I would like  to\r\n\r\nquote   a   few  figures  for   the\r\n\r\ninformation of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1952, 21,767 persons - the\r\n\r\nminimum age was 19 then - applied for\r\n\r\nlicences. In 1953, 25,969  applied.\r\n\r\nAgainst these applications,  17,180\r\n\r\nlicences  were issued in  1952  and\r\n\r\n20,019  in 1953. Apparently,  4,000\r\n\r\nnew licences are being issued every\r\n\r\nyear.  As far as I can see,  nearly\r\n\r\n50,000  more applications would  be\r\n\r\nreceived  if we were to  lower  the\r\n\r\nage  from 19 to 17, because I think\r\n\r\nin  Singapore today we have  89,000\r\n\r\npeople who come between the ages of\r\n\r\n17  and 21 - if I am not mistaken.  I\r\n\r\nmay  be  wrong, because I  did  not\r\n\r\nrefer  to the statistics  which  I\r\n\r\nreceived recently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, traffic accidents also count\r\n\r\na lot in this matter. In 1951, 34,656 reports were received. In 1952, 52,351 and in 1953, 66,139. 9,432 summonses were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissued  in  1951;  11,045 in 1952 and 15,378 in 1953.  Now  these\r\n\r\nfigures, I think, will show an increase in 1954 and 1955, because\r\n\r\nthere  has been a considerable increase in the number of vehicles\r\n\r\non the roads. Looking at these figures, I feel that this lowering\r\n\r\nof the age limit would definitely react on the traffic problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, I do not agree with this amendment and my\r\n\r\nreasons  are  two. The first is traffic accidents.  However,  the\r\n\r\nHon.  Minister  might  argue  that there  is  bound  to  be  some\r\n\r\napprehension in the minds of the public that more vehicles  would\r\n\r\nmean  more accidents, and I think it would be better to save  the\r\n\r\nlives  of  a  few  than enter into a catastrophic situation.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  reason,  Sir,  is that the number of  pirate  taxis  will\r\n\r\nincrease very considerably, which, I think, is not a very healthy\r\n\r\nsituation. Pirate taxis are run for the purpose of making  money,\r\n\r\nand  I  do  not think that we should contribute to that.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink  this amendment will do more harm than good. I also believe\r\n\r\nthat  it  is very untimely and unwise, and that the Minister  has\r\n\r\nbeen ill-advised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not think it\r\n\r\nis  generally  known  that the most adept  pupils  as  pilots  of\r\n\r\naircraft  are  those in the teenage group, and I  understand  the\r\n\r\nreason  is that their reaction is much quicker than older pupils.\r\n\r\nThat  perhaps explains why the figures of accidents given  by  my\r\n\r\nhon.  Friend  and  colleague the Minister for Communications  for\r\n\r\nthose  under  20 are far less, proportionately, than  those  over\r\n\r\nthat age. I would like to say this, Sir, that if that is true - and\r\n\r\nwe  must  accept  the evidence of statistics and  those  who  are\r\n\r\nexperienced in these matters - then it is preferable that we should\r\n\r\neducate  our  drivers when young, in order that  they  should  be\r\n\r\nbetter drivers as they grow older.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it more than a little difficult to understand this\r\n\r\nbusiness  about  pirate  taxis. I do  not  understand  why  young\r\n\r\npersons  should be presumed to go in for pirate taxis.  Is  it  a\r\n\r\ncarry-on from their infancy at playing pirates? I am quite  at  a\r\n\r\nloss to follow this business of pirate taxis and why it is deemed\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  particular age should attract that particular  activity.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  quite fallacious to suggest that the more  driving\r\n\r\ncertificates there are, the more cars there will be on the roads;\r\n\r\nthe younger they are, the more they will be given to piracy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of traffic accidents, Sir, has been dealt with by\r\n\r\nstatistics, and there is only one other thing that I  would  like\r\n\r\nto  add - that laws should not be repressive, and where  they  fall\r\n\r\nunjustly  on  any  particular section of the  people,  then  that\r\n\r\ninjustice should be remedied. No case has been made out, Sir, for\r\n\r\nthis particular discrimination. Figures have been used between 17\r\n\r\nand  19,  and, in fact, we have the evidence of other territories\r\n\r\nto  show that where they have had the opportunity to drive,  they\r\n\r\nhave, in no way, abused their responsibilities and privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nwe must all agree that motoring is now a part of our lives, and I\r\n\r\nbelieve that, as we learned how to pedal a bicycle 20 years  ago,\r\n\r\nwe  should  now  all  learn how to drive  a  car.  It  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered as part of our education. I certainly feel that a  boy\r\n\r\ngraduating from high school should also know how to drive, and  I\r\n\r\nthink  they have made it as part of a person's general  education\r\n\r\nin  some countries that he should be able to drive before  he  is\r\n\r\ngiven a certificate from the school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have just one problem, which I want the Minister in\r\n\r\ncharge  of this Bill to consider. We are now trying to lower  the\r\n\r\nage  of these drivers. It is very good indeed that you lower this\r\n\r\nage  so that more people are eligible to drive, but, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  it will not be within the reach of these people, or  other\r\n\r\npeople  who  will be affected, if the machinery  for  testing  of\r\n\r\ndrivers is also not stepped up. I have been keeping in touch with\r\n\r\npeople who applied for driving licences and they came along to me\r\n\r\nand said, \"It is very difficult to fix up a day for testing.\"  If\r\n\r\nwe  are  going to increase the number of people eligible for  it,\r\n\r\nthen  probably the duration for getting a date for testing  would\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neven   longer.

C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Thomas, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has been\r\n\r\na  very  interesting little debate. I must express\r\n\r\nmy regret to the Member for Seletar (Mr Nair) for\r\n\r\nnot  making  myself clear. He was anxious  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  I  was not a rubber stamp. I never suggested\r\n\r\nthat I was. I never used the word at all. I merely\r\n\r\nsaid  that it was not essential in this case  that\r\n\r\nwe should keep in step with the Federation on this\r\n\r\nvery, very minor matter indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)\r\n\r\nraised the question of more speedy testing so that\r\n\r\npeople  will  get tested, and fail  or  pass  more\r\n\r\nquickly.  It is not a matter which I, personally,\r\n\r\nhave to deal with in my Ministry, but it is purely\r\n\r\na  matter  of  how  many  testers  you  have,  and\r\n\r\nconsequently how much money this Assembly supplies\r\n\r\nfor  paying  the  testers,  and  the  other  costs\r\n\r\ninvolved. If the Member is dissatisfied  with  the\r\n\r\nnumber of testers, he can criticise it, presumably\r\n\r\non the Estimates when they come up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Seletar made a rather confusing\r\n\r\nspeech. I do not think I need deal with the  whole\r\n\r\nof   it,  but  there  are  two  points  which  are\r\n\r\nparticularly confusing. He gave three reasons  why\r\n\r\npeople wanted licences, and one of them, he  said,\r\n\r\nwas owning a car. He said these young people would\r\n\r\nnot  own cars - or very, very few of them would - and\r\n\r\ntherefore there was no need to give them licences,\r\n\r\nand  then  they  would not have  cars.  Well,  the\r\n\r\nanswer is, of course, that a large number of  cars\r\n\r\nare continually being licensed, and the number  is\r\n\r\ngrowing every month - some fantastic figure which  I\r\n\r\ncannot remember at the moment - but the increase  is\r\n\r\na  very  rapid one. Obviously, when father  has  a\r\n\r\ncar, his son is likely to drive it as well. It  is\r\n\r\na  great  convenience that he should  be  able  to\r\n\r\ndrive  it  so  that perhaps when father  goes  to\r\n\r\noffice, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nson  can  bring  the car back to  take  mother  to\r\n\r\nmarket.  It  is a great convenience  to  have  two\r\n\r\npeople  in  the house who can drive. It  does  not\r\n\r\nincrease the number of licensed vehicles,  but  it\r\n\r\ndoes, of course, mean that the car is on the  road\r\n\r\nfor longer periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the confusing thing is that - that although he\r\n\r\nargued  that there were very, very few extra  cars\r\n\r\nas a result of this, yet he talked most vigorously\r\n\r\nabout  the congestion of traffic that would result\r\n\r\nand  the fact that more vehicles on the road would\r\n\r\ncause  more accidents. I think there was confusion\r\n\r\nin  his mind there because different parts of  his\r\n\r\nspeech were not quite well related.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point on which he spoke vigorously was\r\n\r\nunemployment.  He  tried  to  horrify  us  with  a\r\n\r\npicture of a teenage boy driving a 3-ton lorry. If\r\n\r\nhe had done his home work and read the Bill and not\r\n\r\nthe original Road Traffic Ordinance, he would have\r\n\r\nfound that section 23 subsection (1) restricts the\r\n\r\nage  of  driving  a motor vehicle. Subsection  (2)\r\n\r\nrestricts   the  age  of  driving  motor cars.   In\r\n\r\nsubsection  (3) you have to be 21 before  you  can\r\n\r\nhave  a  heavy  locomotive, a light locomotive,  a\r\n\r\nmotor  tractor, or a heavy motor car on the  roads,\r\n\r\nand so forth. In fact, his arguments do not apply.\r\n\r\nWe  are not going to get teen-agers tearing  round\r\n\r\nthe  streets with 3-ton trucks. It is not part  of\r\n\r\nthe intention of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is anything much in his\r\n\r\nquotation  from  the  1952  traffic  figures   for\r\n\r\naccidents and licences and so on. I have the  last\r\n\r\nfew  months' figures if anybody would like to hear\r\n\r\nthem.  I  do not think anybody will. They keep  on\r\n\r\ngoing up more or less. The answer does not lie  in\r\n\r\nputting  an unjust restriction on a small  section\r\n\r\nof  the  population, but in taking proper measures\r\n\r\nof road safety and road education and other things\r\n\r\nwhich are not associated with this Bill in any way\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move the Second\r\n\r\nReading of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.
