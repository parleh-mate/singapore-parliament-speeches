It gives discretion to the employer to pay  a\r\n\r\nbonus  to  his  employees, the amount varying  from\r\n\r\nemployee to employee,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepending  upon their performance and productivity.\r\n\r\nAt  present,  the  bonus  provision  in  collective\r\n\r\nagreements   applies  equally  to  all   employees.\r\n\r\nWhether  a person is a good worker or a bad worker,\r\n\r\nhe  gets  the  same bonus. In other words,  a  good\r\n\r\nworker is penalised in that he gets the same reward\r\n\r\nin  the form of bonus as another who is inefficient\r\n\r\nand  unproductive. However, there are some  genuine\r\n\r\nmisgivings on this provision, as not all  employers\r\n\r\nare  enlightened employers. Some employers may take\r\n\r\nadvantage of this provision and give no bonus or ex-gratia  payment whatsoever. This should not be  the\r\n\r\ncase  if they make a profit. To allay the fears  of\r\n\r\nthe workers that they might be deprived of a bonus,\r\n\r\nthe  amendment to be moved by the Member for  Bukit\r\n\r\nHo   Swee  is  a  reasonable  one  and  should   be\r\n\r\nsupported. It makes the payment of bonus negotiable\r\n\r\nup  to one month's wages, and any payment above one\r\n\r\nmonth's wages is at the discretion of the employer.\r\n\r\nIn  this  manner, bonus can still  be  used  as  an\r\n\r\nincentive  for higher productivity or as  a  reward\r\n\r\nfor good performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the standardisation of working\r\n\r\nhours at 44 hours a week as contained in clause  39\r\n\r\nis  a  very good provision. It does away  with  the\r\n\r\ndistinction  between  a white-collar  and  a  blue-collar worker. The limitation of overtime work will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  create more needed jobs for  our  people.\r\n\r\nHowever, in view of the shortage of skilled workers\r\n\r\nin special trades, this provision has to be applied\r\n\r\nintelligently.  It  may not be  possible  to  limit\r\n\r\novertime  work to 48 hours a month in all cases.  I\r\n\r\nam  glad to note that this has been recognised  and\r\n\r\nis  provided for in sub-clause (4) of clause 39. As\r\n\r\nthis  law is new in more respects than one, we must\r\n\r\ntread  cautiously. We must be magnanimous. We  must\r\n\r\nalways  be  willing to listen and always  ready  to\r\n\r\nchange. With an open mind and flexibility, we  must\r\n\r\nentertain  and  process  all  reactions   to   this\r\n\r\nlegislation, from the workers and trade  unions  to\r\n\r\nthe  employers and the public.

A\r\n\r\ngreat deal of misapprehension, fears and doubts  on\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Employment Bill were created\r\n\r\nin  the  minds of our working citizens even  before\r\n\r\nthis  Bill was introduced in this House.  True,  it\r\n\r\nwas   openly   admitted   that   there   had   been\r\n\r\nconsultations   and   discussions    between    the\r\n\r\nGovernment, N.T.U.C, leaders and employers, and  in\r\n\r\ndiscussions  of this nature it is not  possible  to\r\n\r\ncontain   and   confine   the   contents   of   the\r\n\r\ndiscussions.  But  the  allegations   and   rumours\r\n\r\nconcerning  the provisions of the Bill,  which  had\r\n\r\nbeen   circulated  to  the  public  prior  to   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of the Bill in this  House  and  even\r\n\r\nafter its introduction in this House, have, I feel,\r\n\r\ncaused  much  harm, particularly  as  to  the  real\r\n\r\npurpose  and intent which this Bill is designed  to\r\n\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, rumours, however unbelievable,\r\n\r\nhave  their  source of origin. I feel  it  will  be\r\n\r\nworth  the  while  for  the Government  to  inquire\r\n\r\nwhether there had been any unauthorised leakage  of\r\n\r\ninformation   or  intentions  in  regard   to   the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Bill. It is unwise to  spread  rumours,\r\n\r\nmore  so in this House. If you would allow me,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, to cite one point which was  alleged\r\n\r\nto  be  a provision in this Bill just to illustrate\r\n\r\nhow harmful these rumours were. The rumour was that\r\n\r\nmarried  women, whose husbands are employed,  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  permitted to work in order to create  more\r\n\r\njobs  for  the  unemployed. Such a  rumour  in  the\r\n\r\nprevailing   situation  would   be   difficult   to\r\n\r\ndisbelieve.  Nevertheless, as I say it,  it  had  a\r\n\r\nvery harmful effect on the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to appreciate the intent of this Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich is essential and vital to accelerate economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and  expansion so that  more  jobs  can  be\r\n\r\ncreated,  it  is  absolutely necessary,  first,  to\r\n\r\nremove  those  doubts  and fears  and  restore  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the workers in the pro-labour  policy\r\n\r\nwhich   the  Government  has  always  pursued   and\r\n\r\npractised, so that the implementation of this  Bill\r\n\r\nwould have a fair chance of success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel it is absurd to suggest that the leaders of\r\n\r\nthe  Government have all of a sudden  turned  anti-labour  and  taken sides with the  employers.  What\r\n\r\ncould they benefit at this stage of their political\r\n\r\ncareer and what benefit could the country gain from\r\n\r\na  weak  labour force and a beaten N.T.U.C.?  There\r\n\r\nhas been in the past a total lack of discipline  in\r\n\r\nthe  labour  force. Now is the time  for  all  good\r\n\r\ntrade  union leaders in the Republic to  be  honest\r\n\r\nand  courageous enough to enforce strict discipline\r\n\r\namong  the  members,  particularly  those  who  are\r\n\r\nmalingerers,  lazy,  inefficient  and  unproductive\r\n\r\nworkers.  They should stop giving them  protection.\r\n\r\nBy  and  large,  our citizen workers  are  a  hard-working  lot  and if only our trade  union  leaders\r\n\r\nwill  stop giving protection and cover to this very\r\n\r\nsmall  percentage  of malingerers and  unproductive\r\n\r\nworkers,  we will no doubt achieve a much healthier\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Labour Ordinance, the Clerks\r\n\r\nEmployment   Ordinance  and  the  Shop   Assistants\r\n\r\nEmployment Ordinance, which became law more than 10\r\n\r\nyears   ago,  were  enacted  against  a   different\r\n\r\nbackground and in different circumstances. They are\r\n\r\nall  now outdated and no longer serve the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe people at present and for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of the Employment Bill as\r\n\r\nwell  as the Industrial Relations (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nand the Central Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill,  a\r\n\r\nnew  era  in the employer and employee relationship\r\n\r\nwill  emerge. The intent of the Employment Bill  is\r\n\r\nto  secure  on  a firm and sound basis  a  healthy,\r\n\r\ndisciplined  and competitive labour  force  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  which will ensure our continued survival.\r\n\r\nIt is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  standardise and regulate the  working\r\n\r\nconditions  of  all workers regardless  of  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  white-collar or blue-collar  workers  or\r\n\r\nshop  assistants.  It seeks to remove  malpractices\r\n\r\nand  restrictive  practices which make  enforcement\r\n\r\nand   maintenance  of  discipline  difficult   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  hinder economic growth. If  we  are  to\r\n\r\nincrease productivity, there must be discipline  in\r\n\r\nour  labour force. Without discipline there can  be\r\n\r\nno  efficiency, and without efficiency  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to increase productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has often been said that the\r\n\r\nisland of Singapore has no natural resources of its\r\n\r\nown and that we owe our living to the ingenuity and\r\n\r\nskill  of  our  people.  If  we  are  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  of  the l970s, if we  are  to  continue\r\n\r\nliving  as a people with an identity, if we are  to\r\n\r\nmake  progress,  then we must be prepared  to  make\r\n\r\nsacrifices now to ensure our survival as a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to go into the\r\n\r\ncontroversial provisions of the Bill in detail,  as\r\n\r\nmany  other  Members have already dealt with  them.\r\n\r\nThere  will be ample opportunity to do so  when  we\r\n\r\nare  in  the Committee stage. But I would  like  to\r\n\r\ntouch on Part XI, consisting of clauses 109 to  112\r\n\r\nwhich  incorporate  changes to  give  Government  a\r\n\r\nmeasure  of control over the hiring of workers.  In\r\n\r\nparticular I refer to clause 112 which empowers the\r\n\r\nMinister   to  make  regulations  to  control   the\r\n\r\nengagement  of employees by employers.  On  this  I\r\n\r\nwould  sound a note of caution to the Minister  and\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry.  Present indications  are  that  the\r\n\r\nmachinery  of  the Employment Exchange  is  totally\r\n\r\ninadequate and it is not efficient enough  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith additional work. This provision should not  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  until the machinery of the  Employment\r\n\r\nExchange  is  adequately geared to  its  new  task.\r\n\r\nThere should be consultation with employers and the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C, on  the  proposed regulations  so  as  to\r\n\r\nensure  that their implementation does  not  impede\r\n\r\nefficiency and retard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployers from recruiting the right type of persons\r\n\r\nthey require in the shortest possible time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill in its present form is\r\n\r\nunacceptable without amendments.

At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, another class of people living  in\r\n\r\nluxury  flats gather together in their offices  and\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the Bill.

As a result, they are grumbling  and  have\r\n\r\ncomplained that the Government is trying to  change\r\n\r\nits  attitude towards them and that it has  changed\r\n\r\nits  consistent stand on labour. Some of them  have\r\n\r\neven  gone  to  the extent of saying  that  because\r\n\r\nthere  is only one party in Parliament, it  can  do\r\n\r\nthings  arbitrarily  without  regard  to  anybody's\r\n\r\nopinions.  This  is a very good opportunity  to  be\r\n\r\nmade use of by the Barisan Sosialis and others like\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we examine carefully the arguments of these\r\n\r\npeople  and  assess  them against  the  spirit  and\r\n\r\ncontent of this Bill, we will find that there is  a\r\n\r\ncertain  degree  of discontent among  some  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  We  will  also realise that  some  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  should not have been  included  in  the\r\n\r\nBill at all, or at least they should be amended  in\r\n\r\nthe process of debate. Viewed this way, I regret to\r\n\r\nsay  that  the  contents of this Bill are  entirely\r\n\r\ndivorced from the realities of present-day society.\r\n\r\nThose who drafted this Bill have not gone among the\r\n\r\npeople  to  assess  the living  conditions  of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is said that the Bill gives the correct\r\n\r\ndefinitions   for   reward,   efficiency,   effort,\r\n\r\nproductivity,  then  we are neglecting  the  common\r\n\r\ninterests  between labour-cum-consumer on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand  and  the employer on the other. This  neglect\r\n\r\narises  because  the  long-term  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nemployer  depend on a large consumer  market.  This\r\n\r\nmarket in turn depends on the price of goods and on\r\n\r\nwhether  the  people have the  means  to  buy  such\r\n\r\ngoods.  At  the  same time, in  order  to  increase\r\n\r\nproduction, there must be a demand for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem. The fact remains that labour-cum-consumers do\r\n\r\nnot have the money to buy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe all loyal citizens will do their best to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  challenge  of the  1970s.  The  solution\r\n\r\ncannot be dependent on merely passing a Bill, or on\r\n\r\nany passive way of readjustment to the distribution\r\n\r\nof wealth, because that is not enough. We must take\r\n\r\nall  measures  to maintain our economic  prosperity\r\n\r\nfor  the  long-term stability of Singapore  and  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important also to prevent any grave\r\n\r\nrepercussions  in  our  society.  When  people  are\r\n\r\ndesperate,  they cannot contribute  anything  worth\r\n\r\nwhile to the country. Therefore, we must pursue our\r\n\r\nscientific studies actively in order to promote our\r\n\r\neconomic  progress.  We must  study  the  potential\r\n\r\neffects that science and technology can play in our\r\n\r\neconomic development and stability so that  we  may\r\n\r\nstep  into a new era of industrialisation in  which\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  innovations  and  more  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities. It is necessary to have  innovations\r\n\r\nand modern techniques of manufacturing in order  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  increased needs of the consumers.  There\r\n\r\nshould  also  be improvement in the  techniques  of\r\n\r\nproduction. There should be modern equipment and co-operation between employers and employees in  order\r\n\r\nto increase productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour's demand for wage increases and fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits   is  usually  a  stimulant  to   economic\r\n\r\nprogress.  In  other words, this demand  will  also\r\n\r\nstimulate technical progress. In this present  age,\r\n\r\ntrade unionists realise that wage increases without\r\n\r\nincreased productivity will result in a rise in the\r\n\r\nprices  of  goods and a reduction in the number  of\r\n\r\npeople  employed. Therefore, they try to get fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits  for  the workers. The present  Employment\r\n\r\nBill  seeks  to  take some of these away.  This  is\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the concept of industrial  psychology\r\n\r\nand is also against the mood of the workers. It  is\r\n\r\na retrogressive act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe most people can understand the labour\r\n\r\npolicy  of  our Government. The original policy  of\r\n\r\nbias   towards   labour  will   not   be   changed.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, as an efficient Government with  long-term political objectives, it will preserve its pro-\r\n\r\nlabour policy. The enactment of the Employment Bill\r\n\r\ninto  law is only a change of technique. The  basic\r\n\r\npro-labour  policy  of  our Government  will  never\r\n\r\nchange.  What  can be changed is the  technique  in\r\n\r\norder  to  meet the requirements of the nation  and\r\n\r\nthe changing situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As democratic socialists, the first step for us is\r\n\r\nto  seek  independence and to  raise  productivity.\r\n\r\nUnless   we  can  concurrently  increase   national\r\n\r\nproductivity,  we will not have a  fair,  just  and\r\n\r\nequal  society  for  the people.  It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nnecessary   to  get  a  larger  market.   We   must\r\n\r\nindustrialise in order to improve the livelihood of\r\n\r\nour  people.  Now that Singapore is an  independent\r\n\r\ncountry, we can depend only on our human resources.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  carry  out the  great  tasks  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  The  people should meet the challenge  of\r\n\r\nthis age and march forward in unity. The source  of\r\n\r\neconomic  strength  cannot be  separated  from  our\r\n\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with natural and human resources, we cannot\r\n\r\nensure our country's prosperity and progress. There\r\n\r\nshould   be  some  catalyst  to  promote   economic\r\n\r\nprogress. One mode of bringing this about is by way\r\n\r\nof  legislation. The introduction of the Employment\r\n\r\nBill   can   be   said  to  have  come   from   the\r\n\r\nconsideration   of  trying  to  ensure   full-scale\r\n\r\neconomic prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour explained the true purpose\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill in Parliament the other  day.  After\r\n\r\n1971,   the   economic  welfare  and  survival   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  lies in the hands of our  people.  In  a\r\n\r\nsmall island like Singapore, we cannot plant cotton\r\n\r\nor  other  crops  or  foodstuffs  but  we  have  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the livelihood of many people. One  square\r\n\r\nmile  in  Singapore  will  have  to  support  8,000\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  So  a  stagnant  economy  will  mean\r\n\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Bill is introduced so as to meet our political\r\n\r\nand defence requirements and so that the people can\r\n\r\nadjust  themselves to face the new  situation  when\r\n\r\nthe  British  troops are withdrawn. I  support  the\r\n\r\nviews of the Minister for Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the Employment Bill does not\r\n\r\nmean  that  the  Government has already  adopted  a\r\n\r\npolicy  of  suppression  of  the  workers.  Certain\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the Bill have, on the  other  hand,\r\n\r\ncaused  some  anxiety  among the  workers.  On  the\r\n\r\nsurface, the provisions can easily be construed  to\r\n\r\nbe  anti-labour  or  contrary to  the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  of  bias  towards  labour,  because,  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  degree,  these provisions  will  adversely\r\n\r\naffect  the  future livelihood of the  people.  For\r\n\r\nthis  reason,  I  am  of  the  view  that  if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  be enlightened  enough  to  accept\r\n\r\ncertain amendments tabled by my colleagues, it will\r\n\r\nstill  be  possible to avert any  wrong  impression\r\n\r\ngained by some people about the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his speech in May mentioned\r\n\r\ncertain  Bills  which reflected the  general  mood,\r\n\r\nthought  and spirit of our people. He also exhorted\r\n\r\nthe Government and Members of Parliament to give  a\r\n\r\nlead in the thinking and feeling in the country. In\r\n\r\nview  of  these  considerations, I hope  Government\r\n\r\nwill  accept the amendment which will be  moved  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Bukit Ho Swee (who  is  also  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  the  National  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress) to clause 15. If the Government does  not\r\n\r\naccept the amendment, it will have to consider  the\r\n\r\nconsequences  that will follow. If this  clause  is\r\n\r\npassed  as it now stands, the Government  will  not\r\n\r\nachieve any good results. On the contrary, it  will\r\n\r\nachieve  the  opposite  of that  which  the  clause\r\n\r\nintends,  because there will be quite a  number  of\r\n\r\npeople who will be retiring prematurely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide more jobs\r\n\r\nfor the unemployed, but its enactment into law will\r\n\r\nmean  driving  more  people into  unemployment.  If\r\n\r\nthese people are unemployed when they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  forced to retire, what can they do thereafter?\r\n\r\nif  they  want to be non-criminal types,  they  may\r\n\r\nresort  to becoming hawkers or pirate taxi drivers.\r\n\r\nDoes  the  Government  wish  to  see  more  hawkers\r\n\r\nappearing  and  more pirate taxis  running  on  the\r\n\r\nroads? Clause 15 as it appears in the Bill must not\r\n\r\ntherefore  be passed into law. The Government  must\r\n\r\naccept the amendment tabled by the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nHo Swee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point on which the workers are\r\n\r\nunhappy.   This  is  the  question  of  bonus.   My\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have touched upon this issue.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to say that the amendment tabled by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Bukit Ho Swee fails to meet the objections.  If\r\n\r\nthe  discretion is given to the employer alone, the\r\n\r\nworkers  will be at his mercy, because  it  is  not\r\n\r\nlikely  that  he will be generous or charitable  to\r\n\r\nthem.  I would like to suggest that the quantum  of\r\n\r\nbonus  should  be  a  certain  percentage  of   the\r\n\r\nworkers'  wages and should depend on the employers'\r\n\r\nprofits.  If  the  employer is satisfied  with  the\r\n\r\nproductivity and performance of his workers, he may\r\n\r\nalso  give  them certain rewards in the form  of  a\r\n\r\nbonus.  Thus,  there will be no  animosity  between\r\n\r\nlabour  and  capital. Instead, there  will  be  co-operation to increase productivity. These measures,\r\n\r\nif embodied in the Bill, will encourage the workers\r\n\r\nto  raise their productivity, and good relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  labour and capital will last longer.  They\r\n\r\nwill  be able to co-operate even more and this will\r\n\r\nlead to a more stable situation in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maxim whether a country survives or perishes\r\n\r\ndepends  on  its citizens is valid. To  ensure  its\r\n\r\nsurvival  is the highest virtue that any  patriotic\r\n\r\ncitizen  can aspire to attain. Everyone  should  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to struggle and make sacrifices  for  our\r\n\r\ncountry's  survival. United, we should be  able  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the coming challenge. This should be the task\r\n\r\nof each and every one of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should however give the capitalists\r\n\r\nopportunity to show their patriotism and  sense  of\r\n\r\nloyalty  by donating a certain percentage of  their\r\n\r\nprofits towards our Defence Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  far, it seems that the Government has been  too\r\n\r\ngenerous to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the Employment Bill has given\r\n\r\na very bad impression to the broad masses of people\r\n\r\nwho wish to support the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like for the reasons outlined in my speech\r\n\r\nto   support   the   amendments  proposed   by   my\r\n\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak in full support of the Bill.\r\n\r\nIt  was  only  after  prolonged and  soul-searching\r\n\r\ndiscussions    with   industrialists,    investors,\r\n\r\nemployers  and responsible trade unionists  in  the\r\n\r\npast  years  that we have arrived at the conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  we  must  do something for the  good  of  our\r\n\r\nnational economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the crucial things we have all agreed upon\r\n\r\nis  to boost the economy of our country if we  want\r\n\r\nto  survive  in this turbulent region.  To  achieve\r\n\r\nthis,  our workers must be more efficient and  more\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and,  like soldiers  on  the  battle\r\n\r\nfront,  they must be prepared to accept discipline.\r\n\r\nBut  with  the  present-day  restrictive  practices\r\n\r\nindulged  in  by some of our trade  unions,  it  is\r\n\r\nrather  difficult  to  persuade  entrepreneurs   to\r\n\r\nexpand or even to keep existing factories here, let\r\n\r\nalone attract new capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, it is significant that out of our total\r\n\r\nworking population of about 500,000 persons, only a\r\n\r\nminority, roughly one-fifth of them, are unionised.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  illogical  to  suggest  that  complete\r\n\r\nunionisation  might  have  retarded   rather   than\r\n\r\ncontributed   to   progress  and   development   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in the past 10 years. Take  the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board flats, for example. We  show\r\n\r\nthem  to the world as one of the major achievements\r\n\r\nof  the  Government. The houses and  buildings  are\r\n\r\nprinted  in stamps, books and pamphlets. Architects\r\n\r\nthe  world  over  study them, sociologists  discuss\r\n\r\nthem, and foreign dignitaries visit them. But it is\r\n\r\ncommon  knowledge that not a single  housing  board\r\n\r\nfiat was built by unionised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers.  These  are the fruits of  the  labour  of\r\n\r\ncontract  workers. Only after the  flat  had  taken\r\n\r\nshape  and  the feat accomplished did the unionised\r\n\r\nworkers   come  into  the  picture.   Through   the\r\n\r\nagitation  of  a  few misguided leaders  they  then\r\n\r\nbegan to demand work on Sundays and public holidays\r\n\r\nin order to qualify for double pay and they went to\r\n\r\nsleep on Mondays or Tuesdays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the foundation of the Jurong Industrial\r\n\r\nEstate  was  not  laid  by unionised  workers.  The\r\n\r\nresults  in Jurong are the fruits of the labour  of\r\n\r\nnon-unionised  workers. Only  after  the  factories\r\n\r\nwere  built, machinery installed and the  factories\r\n\r\non  their  way to full production did the unionised\r\n\r\nworkers  become active, bringing in  their  wake  a\r\n\r\nwhole  series of restrictive practices and  abuses,\r\n\r\ncopied wholesale from the British trade unions.  We\r\n\r\nare  not  condemning unionised labour  nor  are  we\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  in  order  to  achieve   economic\r\n\r\nprogress,  we should abolish all trade  unions.  We\r\n\r\nare not against the unions at all. We want them  to\r\n\r\ngrow  and play a useful role in the development  of\r\n\r\nour   country.   We   are   however   against   the\r\n\r\nmalpractices indulged in by some of the unions.  If\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  have a healthy and responsible  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement in Singapore, we must legislate  in\r\n\r\nsuch a way that no trade unionist can be tempted to\r\n\r\nindulge in such malpractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we must make clear is that when we talk about\r\n\r\nuplifting  the living standards of the workers,  we\r\n\r\nmust  think of the 500,000 working population as  a\r\n\r\nwhole and not just focus exclusive attention on the\r\n\r\n100,000  odd unionised workers. It is true that  in\r\n\r\nthe  past we have tended to think in terms of  only\r\n\r\nthe  unionised  workers. The  uplifting  of  living\r\n\r\nstandards  and  social levelling  has  always  been\r\n\r\nconfined  to the unionised workers to the exclusion\r\n\r\nof  the non-unionised workers. In other words,  the\r\n\r\n500,000  hard-working people of Singapore  together\r\n\r\ncreated  the prosperity that we see today, but  the\r\n\r\nfruits of their labour were enjoyed by only a fifth\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe working population. Social organisation on this\r\n\r\nbasis   is  unhealthy  and  is  likely  to   create\r\n\r\ndivisions among our people where, on the one  side,\r\n\r\nwe  find the privileged few getting ever fatter and\r\n\r\nbetter  pay  and more fringe benefits  through  the\r\n\r\nintervention  of  their unions and,  on  the  other\r\n\r\nside,  we  have the general working population  who\r\n\r\nare  over-worked and underpaid, not forgetting  the\r\n\r\nmany  thousands of unemployed who will  be  willing\r\n\r\nand  able to perform the same type of work  as  our\r\n\r\nunionised workers perform for a fraction  of  their\r\n\r\npay.  Such a situation will inevitably lead  to  an\r\n\r\nexplosion  in which all will be lost. We  certainly\r\n\r\ndo not wish to deny our workers better food, better\r\n\r\nclothing and more leisure, but this should  not  be\r\n\r\nat  the  expense  of other people. All  these,  the\r\n\r\nbetter  things in life, must be made  available  to\r\n\r\nall  workers  and  not just a privileged  few.  The\r\n\r\ncreation  of  equal opportunities in  enjoying  the\r\n\r\nfruits  of labour cannot be attained unless we  can\r\n\r\npersuade  some  of our unions to give  up  overtime\r\n\r\nmalpractices, infringement of managerial rights and\r\n\r\nthe  wrong attitude of conniving at the laxity  and\r\n\r\nindiscipline of some unionised workers. It  is  not\r\n\r\nthat  we  want  to be harsh with our  workers.  But\r\n\r\nadequate  measures  are  necessary  since  we  feel\r\n\r\nimpelled  to  look after the working population  at\r\n\r\nlarge,  the  unemployed and the many young  persons\r\n\r\nwho yearly enter the labour market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this background that we are\r\n\r\nintroducing the Employment Bill and the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  (Amendment) Bill. Essentially these  are\r\n\r\nthe two doses of medicine administered to stimulate\r\n\r\nour  economy,  to  boost our  productivity  and  to\r\n\r\nenhance   the   image  of  our  labour   force   at\r\n\r\ninternational  level. As the Chinese  saying  goes.\r\n\r\n\"The mouth is bitter when taking good medicine; the\r\n\r\near  is hurt by true words.\" So trade unionists and\r\n\r\nworkers  must  not whimper to find the  medicine  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit too bitter and unpleasant to swallow. If\r\n\r\nwe want to seek recovery from our economic ills, if\r\n\r\nwe want economic robustness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand health for a long, long time, then we have\r\n\r\nno alternative but to administer this medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of these two pieces of legislation can\r\n\r\nonly  be  seen in the future and we must not  judge\r\n\r\nthem  too  hastily in the present-day context.  The\r\n\r\nconcept  and  objects of the Employment  Bill  have\r\n\r\nbeen  very  clearly enunciated by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  in  his speech. Yet the Bill has  met  with\r\n\r\nmixed  feelings. From the ranks of  the  democratic\r\n\r\nlabour   movement   have   come   responsible   and\r\n\r\nreasonable  criticisms and, as expected,  from  the\r\n\r\nminority  pro-Communist  Barisan  Sosialis   group,\r\n\r\nviolent and vehement outbursts. The clear sight and\r\n\r\nthinking  of  the democratic labour  movement  have\r\n\r\ngenerated light. On the other hand, there have been\r\n\r\nheat  and  fire, the twin elements of  destruction,\r\n\r\nfrom the pro-Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly heartening to note that the\r\n\r\nmajority   of  the  people  of  the  country   have\r\n\r\nrecognised and appreciated the problems facing  us.\r\n\r\nBut  recognition  of  the problems  is  one  thing,\r\n\r\nunderstanding   them   is  another,   and   finding\r\n\r\nsolutions  to  them is yet another. Everyone  knows\r\n\r\nthat we already have a massive unemployment problem\r\n\r\non  our  hands.  But inadequate  thought  has  been\r\n\r\ndevoted to the question of how we are going to deal\r\n\r\nwith the situation. The question is not whether  we\r\n\r\ncan  contain the existing unemployment problems but\r\n\r\nhow, with the aggravation of these problems through\r\n\r\nincreasing numbers entering the labour market every\r\n\r\nyear  and  the  sudden injection of those  who  are\r\n\r\ncurrently  employed with the British Services  into\r\n\r\nthe    labour   market,   we   can   generate   job\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  absorb a significant  number  of\r\n\r\nunemployed people into the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The records of the Unemployment Exchange of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour reveal that at any given time in\r\n\r\nSingapore from 60,000 to 70,000 persons are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseeking  jobs. More than 25,000 young people  enter\r\n\r\nthe labour market each year and we will have in the\r\n\r\nnear  future  another 21,000 or so of our  citizens\r\n\r\njoining the ranks of the unemployed in the wake  of\r\n\r\nthe  British withdrawal, all of them competing  for\r\n\r\njobs which are scarce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that we have made significant advances\r\n\r\nin industrialisation. But what has been achieved is\r\n\r\ninsufficient to solve our problems. No parents like\r\n\r\nto  see  their  grown-up children let  loose  in  a\r\n\r\nsociety  which  offers them no  hope  of  obtaining\r\n\r\njobs. A society bereft of hope will be a frustrated\r\n\r\none  with  automatic outlets for  anti-social  acts\r\n\r\nlike  crime and delinquency, riots and arson.  What\r\n\r\nis  more  important to realise is that a  situation\r\n\r\nlike  this  can  well undermine the  foundation  of\r\n\r\nsociety  and threaten the security of those already\r\n\r\nin  employment.  A teeming labour market  will  not\r\n\r\nonly  depress  wages but also generate  demand  for\r\n\r\ncheap  labour  by employers, with dire consequences\r\n\r\nto  the  ordinary  workers. We  cannot,  therefore,\r\n\r\nallow matters to drift along and take their natural\r\n\r\ncourse.  On  the other hand, we must  do  something\r\n\r\nabout it even though these actions and measures may\r\n\r\nbe  unpleasant  and unpalatable for  some  time  to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logic of the circumstances, therefore,\r\n\r\nnecessitates that we should plan now  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nsituation looming ahead. Metaphorically, it is  too\r\n\r\nlate  to start planting crops after we have reached\r\n\r\nstarvation  level, because we will  never  live  to\r\n\r\nenjoy the harvest. In the face of an impending food\r\n\r\nshortage, the logical step to take is to plant food\r\n\r\ncrops  well  in  advance to prepare  to  avert  the\r\n\r\ncalamity of starvation. Another way of saying it is\r\n\r\nthat  if we dig a well in search of water only when\r\n\r\nwe  feel  thirsty, then that will be too  late.  We\r\n\r\nmust  start  digging a well even  at  a  time  when\r\n\r\nthirst has not yet set in and while there is  still\r\n\r\nmore  drinking water left. Our future is grim  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  demands  strong, stern  and  determined\r\n\r\naction. It is only on this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbasis that we can meet the challenges and hope  for\r\n\r\npartial, if not complete, solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, at the moment, a mild boom in Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot afford to sit back and let everything\r\n\r\ndrift. Time will creep up inexorably and 1971  will\r\n\r\ncome  sooner than we think. A Government worth  its\r\n\r\nsalt,  therefore,  must plan for the  eventualities\r\n\r\nahead.  If it does not, then it does not merit  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of  the  people of Singapore  who  have\r\n\r\nelected  it.  We must not postpone the  search  for\r\n\r\nsolutions and allow events to overtake us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic prerequisite in order that our goal can\r\n\r\nbe  more attainable is the creation of a climate to\r\n\r\ninspire  confidence  and  to  attract  investments,\r\n\r\nlocal  and  foreign. Confidence connotes  political\r\n\r\nand  industrial  stability, and  an  efficient  and\r\n\r\nproductive labour force which will lower production\r\n\r\ncosts.  Hidden  fringe benefits must  be  axed  and\r\n\r\nother  anomalies  abolished.  This  is  to  promote\r\n\r\nsocial justice in which a person's reward should be\r\n\r\ncommensurate with and not out of proportion to  his\r\n\r\ncontribution and, not least of all, bonuses  should\r\n\r\nbe  determined  in accordance with this  principle.\r\n\r\nThe days of unearned bonuses are over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much talk about bonuses in economic\r\n\r\ntheory, that bonus is an incentive payment and,  in\r\n\r\nthe  strict application of the term, it  should  be\r\n\r\nleft  to  the discretion of the employer to  decide\r\n\r\nwhether or not his workmen merit bonuses. The  rule\r\n\r\nshould  be that it the employer generally  makes  a\r\n\r\nprofit  he  grants a bonus to his  workers.  If  he\r\n\r\nmakes  more  profit, he gives proportionately  more\r\n\r\nbonuses,  and  ii  he makes less profit,  he  gives\r\n\r\nless.  The  bonus  is  a device  to  encourage  the\r\n\r\nworkers  to  work hard so that they  can  help  the\r\n\r\nemployer  not  only to maintain the same  level  of\r\n\r\nprofit  but also to try to surpass that of previous\r\n\r\nyears  in order that together they may enjoy bigger\r\n\r\nslices  from a bigger cake. Only foolish  employers\r\n\r\nrefuse to utilise this device, in which case  there\r\n\r\nis no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincentive  for workers to give of their best,  with\r\n\r\nthe result that the profit of the employer is bound\r\n\r\nto  slide down and perhaps eventually the profit is\r\n\r\nturned  into a loss. It is obvious that by properly\r\n\r\nand   intelligently  applying  this   device,   the\r\n\r\nemployer  can benefit as much from a bonus  as  the\r\n\r\nworkers. But it must be given in such a way that it\r\n\r\nis  related  proportionately to the profit  of  the\r\n\r\nfirm  and not otherwise. But once the bonus is made\r\n\r\nbargain-able,  its meaning is lost. It  becomes  no\r\n\r\nlonger the incentive instrument that it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a runaway system of bonus payments, the\r\n\r\nworkers,  with  the  backing of  their  union,  can\r\n\r\ndemand to be paid so many months of extra salary  a\r\n\r\nyear  as their bonus regardless of whether the firm\r\n\r\nmakes  a profit or not, and if the employer refuses\r\n\r\nor  cannot  afford  to pay, then  the  workers  can\r\n\r\nalways  back up their demands by industrial action.\r\n\r\nWhat is more, in order to forestall further losses,\r\n\r\nthe  employer  may  have to  give  in.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nuncommon   to  find  firms,  which  have   incurred\r\n\r\nfinancial losses for the year, end up by paying one\r\n\r\nweek's or one month's pay bonus to the workers.  In\r\n\r\nsuch cases, the word \"bonus\" becomes a misnomer. It\r\n\r\nis  actually an increase of salary or  a  pay  rise\r\n\r\nexcept  that the payment is deferred to the end  of\r\n\r\nthe year or to some festive occasion. Sometimes the\r\n\r\nbonus  may  even  be  written into  the  collective\r\n\r\nagreement. In this case, the employer is  committed\r\n\r\nto  pay bonus during the three-year period in which\r\n\r\nthe collective agreement is in force. In the three-year period it may happen that the employer makes a\r\n\r\nprofit in the first year for which he willingly and\r\n\r\nthankfully  grants a high rate  of  bonus.  In  the\r\n\r\nevent of his sustaining losses in the following two\r\n\r\nyears,  he still has to pay the same rate of  bonus\r\n\r\nas he did the first year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negotiable bonus opens itself to another\r\n\r\ndisadvantage. As things are now, the unions tend to\r\n\r\ndemand  the same rate of bonus for each  and  every\r\n\r\nworker, regardless of whether he belongs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   the   hard-working,  lukewarm  or  indifferent\r\n\r\ncategory,  or the intermediate shades. If  a  hard-working  worker  obtains the  same  reward  as  his\r\n\r\neasygoing  counterpart, then clearly the  so-called\r\n\r\nincentive is really no incentive at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this background that we proposed to\r\n\r\nmake  bonus a non-bargainable item. However,  since\r\n\r\nthe  introduction  of the Bill,  the  N.T.U.C, has\r\n\r\nraised  strong  objections to this  provision.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Ho Swee has put in an amendment to\r\n\r\nmake bonus bargainable up to one month of salary  a\r\n\r\nyear.  The  Minister  for Labour  has  promised  to\r\n\r\nconsider it very carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be repeated that the Employment Bill and\r\n\r\nother  complementary pieces of legislation such  as\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill seek  to\r\n\r\ncreate  better  conditions more  conducive  to  the\r\n\r\nattainment of our objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill has evoked much discussion.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  many  views  have  been  based   on\r\n\r\nmisconception and misunderstanding and twisted from\r\n\r\nthe context of the Bill. There has been an unending\r\n\r\ndrone  over the provisions regarding hours of work,\r\n\r\novertime,   annual   leave,  sick   leave,   public\r\n\r\nholidays,   bonus,  retrenchment   and   retirement\r\n\r\nbenefits;  and  the repeated charge has  been  that\r\n\r\nworkers' rights are being sacrificed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact, the Bill does not affect the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of the majority of the workers.  Even  to\r\n\r\nthe  white-collar  workers, the  sacrifice  is  not\r\n\r\nmuch.  According to the Singapore Sample  Household\r\n\r\nSurvey,  1966, about 576,700 persons are classified\r\n\r\nas being economically active. Of this number, about\r\n\r\n67,300 persons, including nearly 16,400 employed by\r\n\r\nGovernment  and statutory boards, are clerical  and\r\n\r\nrelated  workers. On the assumption that a clerical\r\n\r\nworker starts working at the age of 20, the figures\r\n\r\nindicate that about 27,500 are in the age group  of\r\n\r\n20 to 29. The remainder, that is, about 39,800, are\r\n\r\nin the age group of 30 and over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the question of annual leave first. It\r\n\r\ncan   be   safely   assumed  from  these   figures,\r\n\r\ntherefore, that the bulk, or roughly 60 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe  total  number  in  the  clerical  and  related\r\n\r\ntrades, would have had more than 10 years' service,\r\n\r\nwhich  means  that in effect they  would  still  be\r\n\r\ngetting  the 14 days' paid annual leave which  they\r\n\r\nare  getting now. On the other hand,  workers  in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and servicing industries who form the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  economically  active  population\r\n\r\nwould get not 7 days' paid annual leave perpetually\r\n\r\nbut an enhanced period of 14 days after  they  have\r\n\r\ncompleted  10 years' service. There is  no  ground\r\n\r\nfor   these  grouses.  In  other  words,  with  the\r\n\r\nstandardisation  of  terms of  service  under  this\r\n\r\nBill,   the same benefits will be extended to  all\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to sick leave, some restrictions are\r\n\r\nembodied  in  the Bill. No doubt, this will  entail\r\n\r\nsome inconvenience for the genuinely sick. At least\r\n\r\nthose  who  used to feign sickness have now  to  be\r\n\r\nreally sick whenever they claim to be sick and they\r\n\r\ncan  no  longer malinger by means of a  $2  medical\r\n\r\ncertificate of dubious validity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many workers have not clearly understood the\r\n\r\nprovisions on working hours. The Bill provides  for\r\n\r\na  standard  44-hour working week for all  workers,\r\n\r\nregardless of whether they are white-collar or blue-collar workers. The great majority of workers  are,\r\n\r\nhowever, not affected by this provision. Only  some\r\n\r\n12  per  cent of the working population  comprising\r\n\r\nwhite-collar workers will be affected. Even in such\r\n\r\ncases, they can continue to work the same number of\r\n\r\nhours  as  they  are working now if their  existing\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements provide for a lesser  number\r\n\r\nof hours of work per week. Overtime rates, however,\r\n\r\nwill  become operative only after they complete  44\r\n\r\nhours work a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to overtime work, the position is that\r\n\r\nthe present economic situation is one whereby  it\r\n\r\nis preposterous to permit people to enjoy unlimited\r\n\r\novertime work. In the past,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince  overtime work was paid at double  rate,  the\r\n\r\nusual  abuse  was to \"manufacture\"  overtime.  Work\r\n\r\nthat could and should be done during normal working\r\n\r\nhours was shelved in order to create overtime work.\r\n\r\nThis has no doubt affected the productivity of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  in that false values have been inculcated,\r\n\r\nso  that  the worker is more interested in stalling\r\n\r\nthan  in finishing his job in the way a responsible\r\n\r\nand   conscientious   worker   should.   We   have,\r\n\r\ntherefore, restricted overtime work to 48 hours per\r\n\r\nmonth  but  exemptions can be granted for employees\r\n\r\nin  any  particular  industry or  undertaking.  The\r\n\r\nrestriction imposed on overtime work will result in\r\n\r\ntwo  important factors which are beneficial to  our\r\n\r\neconomy. Firstly, by this restriction, the need  to\r\n\r\nfabricate  overtime  work is  removed:  the  worker\r\n\r\nseeing no purpose in prolonging his job, will  then\r\n\r\nwant  to finish the job quickly so that he  can  go\r\n\r\nhome  early. This means increased productivity  per\r\n\r\nunit  of labour. Secondly, it will create more jobs\r\n\r\nfor  new workers. For example, last month, the Port\r\n\r\nof  Singapore Authority's restriction  on  overtime\r\n\r\nwork  and the introduction of a three-shift  system\r\n\r\nresulted in the creation of over 400 new jobs. This\r\n\r\nis  an example of what can be mobilised to increase\r\n\r\nemployment if other establishments reorganise their\r\n\r\nwork programme along the same lines. There is every\r\n\r\nreason  to believe that by so doing, many more  new\r\n\r\njobs could be created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that all those who have bitterly\r\n\r\ncomplained about the Employment Bill should compare\r\n\r\nit  with the labour laws of other countries in this\r\n\r\nregion.  By  comparison, our Bill  remains  a  much\r\n\r\nbetter piece of legislation than any that exists in\r\n\r\nthis  part of the world. We have a 44-hour  working\r\n\r\nweek,  adequate annual leave and 11 public holidays\r\n\r\na  year.  No labour legislation in these  countries\r\n\r\ncan challenge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomparison   in   terms  of  good   conditions   of\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate my statement by citing a few\r\n\r\nexamples.  Malaysia has a standard 48-hour  working\r\n\r\nweek and 11 public holidays a year as compared with\r\n\r\nour  44-hour working week and 11 public holidays  a\r\n\r\nyear.  Even  in  comparison with more  industrially\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries, our Employment Bill  is  still\r\n\r\nmuch  more  favourable. This can be seen  from  the\r\n\r\nfollowing statistics:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\nName of    \t\tStandard working   Number of Public\r\n\r\nCountry    \t\thours per week     holidays per year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapan                         48                    12\r\n\r\nUnited States                 40                     8\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom                40/42                  6\r\n\r\nFrance (now)                  40                    10\r\n\r\nFrance                        46.9                  10\r\n\r\n  (prior to the strikes)\r\n\r\nGermany                       43.9                  11\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore an utter misconception to believe\r\n\r\nthat  our workers will be groaning under the weight\r\n\r\nof this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the patriotic point of view, it has been\r\n\r\nsuggested  that workers and employers should  alike\r\n\r\nbear  the  same  sacrifices for  the  good  of  the\r\n\r\nnation. This is only wishful thinking. There is  no\r\n\r\nreason  why a foreign investor should make  one-way\r\n\r\ntraffic  type of sacrifices merely for our benefit.\r\n\r\nThey  have not come in with their finances to  save\r\n\r\nus from starvation. They have come in with a profit\r\n\r\nmotive.   And   if  we  make  life   difficult   or\r\n\r\nunprofitable for them, they could just sell out  or\r\n\r\nliquidate   their  firms  and  go  elsewhere.   The\r\n\r\nultimate sufferers will be the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nA  cruel  fact of life in the world today  is  that\r\n\r\nmoney can move, but not men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the employers must not form the\r\n\r\nidea  that, because of this Bill and the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations (Amendment) Bill, they can have the whole\r\n\r\nworld  to  themselves. We have heard of  complaints\r\n\r\nthat  some small employers have actually threatened\r\n\r\nto  reduce the pay of their workers. One shopkeeper\r\n\r\nI know of has in fact told his shop assistants that\r\n\r\nfrom  now,  they  must work 7 days a  week  without\r\n\r\nrest.  This kind of attitude is not only wrong  but\r\n\r\nalso dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate how some employers can exploit the\r\n\r\nsituation for their own selfish ends, I will  quote\r\n\r\nan  example of an employer who is running  a  daily\r\n\r\nnewspaper  in  Singapore.  Immediately  after   the\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill was tabled in this House in May, he\r\n\r\ninstructed  his  editors  to  write  editorials  to\r\n\r\ncondemn  the  Bill,  stating  that  the  provisions\r\n\r\ntherein were harsh and that they should be deleted.\r\n\r\nIn  doing  so, his foremost aim was to  play  along\r\n\r\nwith the taste of the workers in order to boost the\r\n\r\nsales  of  his newspaper. However, after some  time\r\n\r\nwhen  his  workers  and  journalists  staked  their\r\n\r\nclaims  for  better working conditions,  he  turned\r\n\r\naround and told them that since the Employment Bill\r\n\r\nwas going to be passed, he was not prepared to give\r\n\r\nthem  anything  at all. In fact, he even  suggested\r\n\r\nslashing  their  pay and withdrawing  their  yearly\r\n\r\nbonuses. What is this employer trying to do? He  is\r\n\r\nusing both edges of the blade to his own advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in public, he condemns the Bill to the\r\n\r\npoint  of misleading his readers in order to boost\r\n\r\nthe  sales of his newspaper. On the other hand,  in\r\n\r\nprivate, he exploits the Bill to the full even to\r\n\r\nthe  extent of misinterpreting it in order to  deny\r\n\r\nhis  workers  their rightful share of the  profits.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the kind of unscrupulous and double-faced\r\n\r\nemployers  we  have to watch out for  and  we  have\r\n\r\nenough  power  to deal adequately  with  them.  The\r\n\r\nemployers  should  realise  that  without  the  co-operation  of  their workers, they cannot  hope  to\r\n\r\nreap    profits    from    their    factories    or\r\n\r\nestablishments, and that they cannot afford to have\r\n\r\ndisgruntled and discontented employees.  They  must\r\n\r\nalso  realise  that  whatever labour  laws  we  are\r\n\r\nintroducing,  we do so only to ensure the  survival\r\n\r\nof  the whole country and not in order to enrich  a\r\n\r\nfew  employers.  I am quite sure in the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  (Amendment)  Bill  there  are   adequate\r\n\r\nprovisions   with   which  we  can   restrain   the\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  employers  from  abusing  our  labour\r\n\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the pages of this Bill are\r\n\r\nembodied  balances  and brakes which,  on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand,   ensure   that  managements  perform   their\r\n\r\nfunctions  properly  and responsibly  and,  on  the\r\n\r\nother,  promote  and protect the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers both in the short run and in the long  run.\r\n\r\nThis   Bill   is  the  prescription  for  unimpeded\r\n\r\neconomic  health and uninterrupted  progress.

This is the kind  of  trade\r\n\r\nunionism that has led to all the broken-back States\r\n\r\nwhich today litter the developing world. Judging by\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  anonymous  correspondents  who   get\r\n\r\nregular  publicity  in  the  Eastern  Sun,  it   is\r\n\r\napparent  that the formidable and daunting economic\r\n\r\nchallenges which await the people of Singapore just\r\n\r\naround the corner do not concern these gentlemen at\r\n\r\nall.  They  are  more interested  in  painting  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of  this Republic as a lot of  anti-labour\r\n\r\nghouls  and  accusing the responsible trade  union\r\n\r\nleadership  of  being stooges.  If  we  go  by  the\r\n\r\nstandards  which these anonymous cowards set,  then\r\n\r\nthe  one  qualification  which  no  trade  unionist\r\n\r\nshould  possess on any account is the capacity  for\r\n\r\ncareful  thought  and  analysis  in  depth.  Rather\r\n\r\nshould  trade unionists say, in effect,  to  blazes\r\n\r\nwith the unemployment problem, and to blazes with the  need  to create 100,000 new jobs by the  early\r\n\r\n1970s,  or  to  blazes with everything  except  the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of the organised creed of  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to the lasting credit of the labour\r\n\r\nmovement in Singapore that today we can boast to  a\r\n\r\nmuch  larger  extent than previously of  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  leadership which thinks in terms  of  social\r\n\r\npriorities   and  of  the  collective  effort   and\r\n\r\ndiscipline necessary if the people of Singapore are\r\n\r\nto survive in the gruelling years ahead. Not for us\r\n\r\nany  more the empty-headed sloganising of the past,\r\n\r\nnor   the   striking  of  idiotic  and  thoughtless\r\n\r\npostures. It is to the lasting credit of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore that they have thrown up a  political\r\n\r\nleadership\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  refuses to play up to any sectional  gallery\r\n\r\nbut,  instead, has the courage to take  the  people\r\n\r\ninto their confidence and tell them, even brutally,\r\n\r\nthe  harsh  facts of economic life. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas placed a premium on intelligent trade unionism.\r\n\r\nIt  must,  therefore, be prepared  to  subject  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  it  proposes in this Bill to  intelligent\r\n\r\nand searching criticisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other trade union colleagues in this House have\r\n\r\ntouched  on various aspects of this Bill  and  have\r\n\r\npointed  out  some  of  its  serious  defects   and\r\n\r\nshortcomings. For my part, I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   re-examine  very  carefully   the\r\n\r\nprovision  in  clause 47 which proposes  to  remove\r\n\r\nbonus  payments  altogether  from  the  sphere   of\r\n\r\ncollective  bargaining. Let me  grant  straightaway\r\n\r\nthat bonus payments have sometimes been abused  and\r\n\r\nthat  there have been occasions when profit sharing\r\n\r\nbonuses  were claimed even when no profits existed.\r\n\r\nLet  me also grant that potential investors may not\r\n\r\nbe  forthcoming if such abuses are not checked  and\r\n\r\nif  unions  are  expected to demand bonus  payments\r\n\r\neven   before   any  industries  have   established\r\n\r\nthemselves on a stable and profitable basis.  Throw\r\n\r\nthe  bath water out by all means. But must the baby\r\n\r\nalso  be  thrown out with the bath water? This,  in\r\n\r\neffect,  is what this particular provision proposes\r\n\r\nto do. The more intelligent thing to do would be to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  necessary checks to  prevent  obvious\r\n\r\nabuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Government to give serious\r\n\r\nconsideration to the observations which  I  propose\r\n\r\nto   offer.   Long  established  banks,   insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies,  petroleum companies and  various  other\r\n\r\ncommercial  undertakings, which have  long  enjoyed\r\n\r\ncomfortable   or   more  than  comfortable   profit\r\n\r\nmargins,  have  been in the habit of paying  annual\r\n\r\nbonuses to their employees without any qualms  and.\r\n\r\nindeed,  quite cheerfully. Such payments have  very\r\n\r\noften  been sanctioned or awarded by the Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court. Every year millions  of  dollars\r\n\r\nare  being  distributed to commercial employees  by\r\n\r\nway of bonus payments. It is now proposed to remove\r\n\r\nthese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nannual  payments  altogether  from  the  sphere  of\r\n\r\ncollective  bargaining. Indeed, assuming  that  all\r\n\r\nbonus payments are stopped, can the Government tell\r\n\r\nus  what  employers will do with these millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars  which  they  have been  in  the  habit  of\r\n\r\ndistributing annually as bonus payments?  Does  the\r\n\r\nGovernment have any guarantee that all these  large\r\n\r\nsums   of  money  will  go  into  reinvestment   in\r\n\r\nSingapore? The chances are that they will  go  into\r\n\r\nnothing of this kind. Rather they are likely to  go\r\n\r\ninto  private  pockets. I can give up  the  benefit\r\n\r\ngladly if I am convinced that the surrender of this\r\n\r\nbenefit will lead to greater social benefit. But in\r\n\r\nthis  case I have no such assurance. All I know  is\r\n\r\nthat the bonus payments will, in all likelihood, be\r\n\r\ntaken  away  without leading to  any  corresponding\r\n\r\nsocial  benefit.  Indeed, the only  outcome  of  my\r\n\r\nrenunciation is that the bulging purses  of  a  few\r\n\r\nwill bulge even more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has not given sufficient thought to\r\n\r\nthe  fact that bonus payments can be made to  serve\r\n\r\nas  an incentive to increased productivity. We  all\r\n\r\nknow  that  it is desirable to give an increase  in\r\n\r\nthe profitability of an undertaking. 1 would submit\r\n\r\nthat  the  best way to cultivate such  a  desirable\r\n\r\ninterest is for management to declare categorically\r\n\r\nthat  the workers shall be entitled to a fair share\r\n\r\nof  any  distributable profit. In this  event,  the\r\n\r\nworkers  will see that it is in their direct  self-interest  to increase productivity and  thereby  to\r\n\r\nenhance the profitability of the undertaking  which\r\n\r\nemploys  them.  For they know that the  higher  the\r\n\r\nprofitability,  the larger the  bonuses  that  will\r\n\r\naccrue to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some other considerations which I would\r\n\r\nurge the Minister for Labour and his colleagues  to\r\n\r\nconsider  more  carefully when the  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. moves his amendments to this clause.  Not\r\n\r\nto  do  so would be to turn a deaf ear to sane  and\r\n\r\nrational  arguments, which is what  the  Government\r\n\r\nprofesses to encourage in the trade union movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  we first sat here as a new Parliament of  the\r\n\r\npeople's   choice,  we  were  promised   that   the\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill would standardise and regulate  the\r\n\r\nterms  and conditions of service for all grades  of\r\n\r\nemployees. It was to be a package deal designed  to\r\n\r\nlessen  abuses of fringe benefits and  malpractices\r\n\r\namongst  our work-force and, more important  still,\r\n\r\nto aim at increasing productivity and promoting and\r\n\r\nhastening industrial growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I consider it a task and responsibility we\r\n\r\nowe  to  the people of the Republic to provide  the\r\n\r\nleadership in seeing this Bill through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering any piece of legislation, the basic\r\n\r\nconsideration, as I see it, must be whether or  not\r\n\r\nsuch a piece of legislation and its provisions  are\r\n\r\nrelevant to the prevailing circumstances. It is not\r\n\r\nmy  intention  here to reiterate all the  difficult\r\n\r\nproblems  we  are  going to face in  the  next  few\r\n\r\nyears.  The Hon. Minister for Labour has,  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of - the more absent-minded, listed  facts\r\n\r\nand  figures and has dwelt on them in great detail.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to have these problems in mind when\r\n\r\nexamining  whether the present Bill is relevant  to\r\n\r\nour  circumstances. It calls for more than ordinary\r\n\r\ncourage   to  face  the  situation  and  make   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  adjustments and sacrifices  to  overcome\r\n\r\nthese  problems.  Our  workers  must  be  made   to\r\n\r\nunderstand the problems ahead so that they know why\r\n\r\nand  for  whom they are making the adjustments  and\r\n\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all agreed that the years ahead are\r\n\r\ndifficult  and  cruel.  To  survive  these   years,\r\n\r\nSingapore must launch a programme of rapid economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and  promote  speedy industrial  expansion.\r\n\r\nThis  will  then  provide employment  opportunities\r\n\r\nand,   in   so   doing,  ensure   continuance   and\r\n\r\nconsolidation  of  stable  political   and   social\r\n\r\nconditions.  For all these things a price  must  be\r\n\r\npaid,   because  history  has  shown  that  neither\r\n\r\neconomic growth nor industrialisation has ever been\r\n\r\nachieved on the cheap!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that many of the more advanced countries\r\n\r\nof  today  have  paid a very high  price  in  toil,\r\n\r\ndiscipline and sacrifice to achieve this.  In  some\r\n\r\ntotalitarian    countries,   human    lives    were\r\n\r\ndeliberately  sacrificed so that the country  could\r\n\r\nachieve  rapid  industrialisation.  In  our   case,\r\n\r\nthanks  to  the democratic principles we uphold  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and the practices we carry out, the  cost\r\n\r\ndemanded  for such development cannot be  made  and\r\n\r\nare  not  being  made  so  high  as  to  make  life\r\n\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here in front of us a Bill that merely\r\n\r\nsets   out  to  curtail  malpractices  and   lessen\r\n\r\nopportunities of abuse of fringe benefits.  A  very\r\n\r\nsmall  section of our work-force is asked  to  work\r\n\r\nfive  hours more a week only when requested. And  1\r\n\r\nsay  this particular section of the work-force  has\r\n\r\nfor  many years in the past been living on the  fat\r\n\r\nof  the  land. As the Hon. Minister for Labour  has\r\n\r\nput  it,  the medicine we are now administering  is\r\n\r\nnot  really that bitter. And I say that it is  well\r\n\r\nworth  it  if at the end of it all we see  progress\r\n\r\nand stability emerge all the more flourishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what will happen if we in this\r\n\r\nParliament  are weak and try to seek  an  easy  way\r\n\r\nout.  We  can  sit back and admire the Government's\r\n\r\nachievements for the last nine years (of  which  we\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P, are extremely proud). We will let the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  the  l970s take care  of  themselves.\r\n\r\nMaybe  some of us will kneel down and pray that  by\r\n\r\nsome  good  fortune, conditions  in  Britain  would\r\n\r\nimprove  so  much  that the Pound  would  overnight\r\n\r\nbecome so strong that the British Government  would\r\n\r\nbe prepared to maintain the bases here longer. Then\r\n\r\nthe  sum total of all this is that our people  will\r\n\r\nmake merry, drink and dine. Our Prime Minister will\r\n\r\nturn  round and say he is the happiest man  because\r\n\r\nhis people know how to enjoy life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, the truth is that this is not going to\r\n\r\nbe the case. If we just sit back and relax, we will\r\n\r\nbe on the sure way\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  economic  stagnation  and  eventually  we  will\r\n\r\ncollapse.  The  result of such a  collapse  is  too\r\n\r\nhorrible  even  to imagine, when we  consider  that\r\n\r\nhere  in Singapore we have a population density  of\r\n\r\nsomething  like 8,500 or so to a square  mile.  The\r\n\r\nHon. Minister for Labour has predicted here in this\r\n\r\nChamber,   when   expounding  his   philosophy   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment and consumption, that we can only  live\r\n\r\nby  eating one another and the Prime Minister  sums\r\n\r\nit  up by saying that we must then all perish! This\r\n\r\nmust  be  the  case because we just  have  not  the\r\n\r\nagricultural base to allow us to plant anything  to\r\n\r\nfeed ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident, however, that this is not going to\r\n\r\nbe  the end of a people and a country that has over\r\n\r\nthe  past one and a half centuries built out  of  a\r\n\r\nfishing village a prosperous and flourishing island\r\n\r\nState!  We  have that spirit of self-reliance  that\r\n\r\neven with all the problems coming on us as a result\r\n\r\nof  the  British pull-out, we will emerge  all  the\r\n\r\nmore stable, secure and flourishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what I see the Bill sets out to prove. The\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the  workers shall  be  and  will  be\r\n\r\nremoulded.   Because  our  people  understand   the\r\n\r\nproblems,   we   have  decided  to   make   certain\r\n\r\nadjustments  and sacrifices at this  stage  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry's  history. Our workers  cannot  depend  on\r\n\r\nabuses   of   fringe  benefits  to  deprive   their\r\n\r\nunemployed fellow citizens of jobs. Each and  every\r\n\r\nworker  will  get a day's pay for  a  day's  honest\r\n\r\nwork. These adjustments and sacrifices are made not\r\n\r\nfor  some  tribal chieftains, not for  a  group  of\r\n\r\ncapitalists,   not  for  a  set   of   self-seeking\r\n\r\npoliticians,  not for some fortunate  sons  of  the\r\n\r\nsoil,  but  for  a  more  prosperous,  secure   and\r\n\r\nflourishing Singapore wherein every citizen  shares\r\n\r\nequal   rights   and  obligations,   enjoys   equal\r\n\r\nprivileges and opportunities!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fruits and the end result of all these\r\n\r\nadjustments and sacrifices shall feed not only  the\r\n\r\ngeneration  that will see through  the  1970s,  but\r\n\r\nalso  for the many others who will come after them!\r\n\r\nSo I say - I again quote the Hon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Labour - that  we  should  \"postpone\r\n\r\nimmediate rewards for greater gains in the future\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if our workers are not prepared to work just\r\n\r\nfive  hours  more  a  week,  forego  a  few  public\r\n\r\nholidays, restrict scoring on overtime now, let  me\r\n\r\nsay to them, in the very near future they will have\r\n\r\nto strive very much harder under sterner rule of  a\r\n\r\nchaotic and disorderly state which must come  about\r\n\r\nwhen our unemployment could not be checked and  has\r\n\r\nreached  such  unmanageable proportions  that  many\r\n\r\nworkers will want to work even for a dog's reward!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now confine myself to one or two\r\n\r\nspecific clauses in the proposed Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision on the payment of bonus has aroused\r\n\r\ngreat interest. To me this must necessarily be non-negotiable. But  I  understand  from  my  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nfriends  in  this Chamber that they would  want  to\r\n\r\nmake  it negotiable up to one month's wages.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see the logic of all this. I foresee what  the\r\n\r\nemployer will do is to evaluate the annual worth of\r\n\r\nhis workers and divide it by 13 rather than usually\r\n\r\nby  12,  thereby leaving himself a quantum  of  one\r\n\r\nmonth's wages for negotiation. Sir, this is what we\r\n\r\nset out to eliminate. Bonus should be an incentive.\r\n\r\nIt  should  not be part and parcel of the take-home\r\n\r\npay  of the worker at all. What I would rather  see\r\n\r\nis  a law to request every employer to declare  his\r\n\r\nprofits  and  some kind of profit-sharing  schedule\r\n\r\ndrawn  up. In this way, both the employer  and  his\r\n\r\nemployees   will  make  it  a  point  to   increase\r\n\r\nproductivity so that the net profits will go up and\r\n\r\neverybody  in  the company gets more. However,  let\r\n\r\nthe  N.T.U.C.'s  scheme  be  tried  out  first.   I\r\n\r\nenvisage  that at the end of the trial  period,  my\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. friends  will  want  to  see  the  system\r\n\r\nchanged.   In  this  respect.  I  really   do   not\r\n\r\nunderstand  why the traditional ang pows  given  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of the year by the Chinese towkay  to  his\r\n\r\ncoolies  in Chinese business circles cannot  really\r\n\r\nwork.  In this system, the question of how much  to\r\n\r\ngive is entirely up to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  employer who, I believe, after he has done his\r\n\r\ncalculations   -  Chinese  businessmen   are   very\r\n\r\ncalculating  -  will  give the  most  to  his  most\r\n\r\nproductive  employees. And I do not  see  how  this\r\n\r\ncannot be extended to the unionised sections of the\r\n\r\nwork-force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 42 (2) of the Bill is of particular\r\n\r\ninterest to me. When I was in the public service, I\r\n\r\nnoticed   that  every  so  often  a  worker   would\r\n\r\nconveniently absent himself either on  the  Tuesday\r\n\r\nafter or the Thursday before the Easter holidays so\r\n\r\nthat  he  could  enjoy watching the Grand  Prix  in\r\n\r\ngrand style without worrying whether at the end  of\r\n\r\nit, he would be fit to work or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> He should join the\r\n\r\nArmy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> The introduction of this\r\n\r\nprovision will put a stop to such nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a more general coverage, the Bill seeks to\r\n\r\nbring  the  white-collar  workers'  conditions   of\r\n\r\nservice  in  line  with those  of  the  blue-collar\r\n\r\nworkers. This, as I see it, will definitely enhance\r\n\r\nthe  status of the latter. As I pointed out in  the\r\n\r\ndebate on the President's Speech, this must be done\r\n\r\nif  we  want  to  lure more of our youngsters  into\r\n\r\ntaking up blue-collar jobs. Maybe at the end of the\r\n\r\ntrial  period of this Bill, we will be in a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to provide better conditions  of  service\r\n\r\nfor blue-collar workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, may I say that basically, this\r\n\r\nBill,  far  from  being  designed  to  deprive  the\r\n\r\nworkers  of  their  rights, actually  sets  out  to\r\n\r\noutline the minimum and basic conditions of service\r\n\r\nfor  our workers. These basic conditions are in  no\r\n\r\nway  inferior  to those existing in  the  countries\r\n\r\nsurrounding us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that our work-force is mature\r\n\r\nenough  to understand the problems of the  day  and\r\n\r\naccept  the position that what is asked of them  is\r\n\r\nreally  relevant  and necessary under  the  present\r\n\r\ncircumstances.

Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to make another analysis of the\r\n\r\nBill.  I  have  been preceded in  this  respect  by\r\n\r\ncompetent    hon.   Members.   The    controversial\r\n\r\nprovisions   of  the  Bill  have  been  extensively\r\n\r\nillustrated and, when set against the magnitude  of\r\n\r\nour  economic problems, I think they become reduced\r\n\r\nto sacrifices which our workers can afford to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For myself, the merits of the Bill are simply that\r\n\r\nit  seeks to achieve a situation which is the logic\r\n\r\nof the present limitations of our economy. And that\r\n\r\nit  is  a  facet  of a vast definite programme  for\r\n\r\nnational    consolidation,    if    not    national\r\n\r\nconstruction,  made necessary by our assumption  of\r\n\r\nsovereignty  on  the  9th  of  August,  1965,   and\r\n\r\nrendered   imperative  by  the  impending   British\r\n\r\nwithdrawal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trading and servicing centre and on the way\r\n\r\ntowards  being  a  manufacturing nation,  Singapore\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the  saleability  of  its  goods   and\r\n\r\nservices for a  living. Productivity, therefore, is\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbasic  concern  of  our  economy.  Labour  must  be\r\n\r\nadjusted   accordingly.  Labour's role  of   merely\r\n\r\nproducing the goods for wages must, in my  opinion,\r\n\r\nat  this-phase  of  our  economic  development,  be\r\n\r\nrefashioned  in order to produce more  goods  at  a\r\n\r\nlower  cost  per unit of output and,  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  maintaining quality. The  structure  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy  is such that if our country is to continue\r\n\r\nto  bustle  and thrive and our living standards  to\r\n\r\nremain as high as they are today or 50 years  later\r\n\r\nor  100 years later, our chief productive resource,\r\n\r\ni.e. labour, must be consistent with  capital  and\r\n\r\ntheir  co-ordination must result in-high industrial\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill has been dictated by sheer\r\n\r\nnecessity. For years, our labour force has operated\r\n\r\nunder  conditions of strife. In the public  sector,\r\n\r\nit  had  to-contend  with an  arrogant,  unyielding\r\n\r\ncolonial government, in the private sector, it  was\r\n\r\nengaged in a relentless struggle against forces  of\r\n\r\nexploitation.  Responses  assumed  a  pattern   and\r\n\r\nbecame  set.  Labour's  response  to  capital   was\r\n\r\nlargely governed by the principle of work for  fair\r\n\r\nwages  and as soon as the employer showed  profits,\r\n\r\nlabour said, \"Share.\" Labour conducted its role  of\r\n\r\nprotecting the workers' welfare without a national\r\n\r\ncontext.  In the pre-Malaysia and Malaysia periods,\r\n\r\nthis  may  have been a valid role because,  if  the\r\n\r\nchips  had been down then, at least one could still\r\n\r\nhave  opted for a new life elsewhere. Today we  are\r\n\r\nsovereign  and,  simply  put,  it  means  that   we\r\n\r\ntogether  are on our own for better or  for  worse.\r\n\r\nAnd  if the worst happens, we will have to take it.\r\n\r\nMass option for a new life elsewhere is out of  the\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a situation, labour's agitations, however\r\n\r\nlegitimate,  must be tempered by the exigencies  of\r\n\r\nthe   nation.  These  exigencies  result  from  the\r\n\r\nimpending  British withdrawal by 1971. As  detailed\r\n\r\nby  the Minister for Finance, we need to spend  the\r\n\r\nsum  of  $900 million in the course of  the  coming\r\n\r\nfour  years to counter the recession that will  be\r\n\r\ncaused  by  the progressive reduction.  In  British\r\n\r\nmilitary expenditure over this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperiod. This expenditure of $900 million will  have\r\n\r\nto  be above the normal public expenditure for  the\r\n\r\nsame  period.  $200  million of this  $900  million\r\n\r\nrepresents the total of private investment we would\r\n\r\nhave  to  induce in the course of the  coming  four\r\n\r\nyears. This figure is in addition to the prevailing\r\n\r\nscale of $250 million per annum. Sir, we can expect\r\n\r\nto  succeed  in inducing at least half this  amount\r\n\r\nif,  in addition to the political stability of  our\r\n\r\ncountry  and  the industrial peace  which  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved,  we  can offer investors an  enthusiastic\r\n\r\nlabour  force conditioned to secure high industrial\r\n\r\nproductivity  and  an  assurance  of  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nfreedom  to  manage,  and generally  an  industrial\r\n\r\nclimate which is favourable to industrial expansion\r\n\r\nand confidence in the future. Both these offers are\r\n\r\nspelt out in the Employment Bill and the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But high industrial productivity is the cumulative\r\n\r\nresult  of  a number of basic industrial needs  and\r\n\r\nprocesses  like  buildings,  factories,  equipment,\r\n\r\npower and transport, skilled labour, managerial and\r\n\r\ntechnical  know-how and efficient  services.  These\r\n\r\nare   all   immediate  objectives  in  our  overall\r\n\r\nreorganisation for survival and development through\r\n\r\nour  urban  renewal,  industrialisation,  technical\r\n\r\norientation   in   education,  markets   discovery,\r\n\r\nquality control and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have indicated earlier, we are reorganising\r\n\r\nnow  to  remain a nation in the future. Though  the\r\n\r\nproblems  before us are vast, they are  not  beyond\r\n\r\nsolution.  But  woe betide us if we  fail,  for  we\r\n\r\nshall  fall into an economic stagnation from  which\r\n\r\nwe  can  hope to recover only after many years  and\r\n\r\nmuch grief. What is urgently required is a national\r\n\r\nmood for productive work at all levels motivated by\r\n\r\na  realisation of the full consequences of failure.\r\n\r\nIf  this  Bill  and  the debate on  it  inside  and\r\n\r\noutside  this Chamber can stir in our  workers  the\r\n\r\nbeginnings of this mood, it will already have begun\r\n\r\nto achieve results before its operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there will be criticisms on this Employment\r\n\r\nBill.   But  whatever  may  be  said  against   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for introducing this Bill, I think  even\r\n\r\nthe  devil would blush at the allegation that  this\r\n\r\nleadership is helping the capitalists to  get  rich\r\n\r\nat  the expense of the workers. This leadership has\r\n\r\ngone  down  in our political history  of  the  last\r\n\r\ndecade as a government that has sought the survival\r\n\r\nof  the  country and the realisation of the  common\r\n\r\ngood.  I  do  not think any serious minded  quarter\r\n\r\nwould  question the truth of this.  This  Bill  has\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced at this stage for no other  reason\r\n\r\nthan that it would help the survival of the country\r\n\r\nand the realisation of the common good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to some of the controversial clauses\r\n\r\nwill  be  moved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\nand Minister for Labour himself. Amendments to five\r\n\r\nclauses  will be moved by the Member for  Bukit  Ho\r\n\r\nSwee.  The  alleged severity of the Bill  would  be\r\n\r\nreduced  as  a  result.  In addition,  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  (Amendment) Bill offers  a  worthy\r\n\r\ncompensatory privilege.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it has been disturbing to hear of the\r\n\r\ncases  of two employers already attempting to abuse\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Bill. I am heartened to have\r\n\r\nbeen  told that the Minister would wield his  stick\r\n\r\nif  the need arose. Let the Minister not find  that\r\n\r\nthe  stick has been misplaced when the time  comes,\r\n\r\nfor  I  am  sure  that  our  workers  will  respond\r\n\r\nfavourably and management is not all that  angelic.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic  and  earnest labour  alone  will  not\r\n\r\nsuffice.  There must be progressive innovations  at\r\n\r\nthe  managerial and technological levels by capital\r\n\r\nif  the hopes and intentions of this Bill are to be\r\n\r\nrealised.  Productivity promotion itself needs,  in\r\n\r\nmy  view,  an infrastructure for care, control  and\r\n\r\nresearch. The Government is urged to consider  this\r\n\r\naspect  of  our  reorganisation  for  survival  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, there is a period in the\r\n\r\nhistory of a nation when the people begin to  be  a\r\n\r\nnation. For ourselves, this is it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Inche Sha'ari bin Tadin):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  since  this  Bill  was  first  introduced  in\r\n\r\nParliament,  it  has generated,  understandably,  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of  public interest and comment,  some\r\n\r\nfavourable,  some controversial, some adverse.  All\r\n\r\nthis   has  helped  us  reflect  further   on   the\r\n\r\nrequirement in the best interest of our country and\r\n\r\npeople  in time to come. It is, however, heartening\r\n\r\nto  see that there has been a general appreciation,\r\n\r\nif  not acceptance, of the motivation and need  for\r\n\r\nthis   legislation  from  all  sectors,   including\r\n\r\nlabour, management and the press. Criticisms,  most\r\n\r\nof  them  constructive, have  been  on  aspects  of\r\n\r\ndetail, on provisions for hospitalisation, payments\r\n\r\nof  bonus,  overtime and fringe  benefits  and  the\r\n\r\nlike.  It  is  further reassuring to see  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour has an open mind for  argument\r\n\r\nand   persuasion   and   will  consider   seriously\r\n\r\nnecessary  amendments arising  out  of  a  rational\r\n\r\nreview within and outside this Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make my observations now on the necessity\r\n\r\nfor and urgency of this legislation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were interconnected factors behind this Bill\r\n\r\n- higher Gross National Product and the creation of\r\n\r\nmore   jobs.  It  is  not  the  intention  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  inflict  pain  on  the  workers  by\r\n\r\nintroducing  this  Bill. With its  introduction,  a\r\n\r\nmore favourable climate for established enterprises\r\n\r\nto  expand  and to attract more foreign investments\r\n\r\ninto  the  Republic  will be created.  This  is  an\r\n\r\ninevitable  measure  to prevent  our  country  from\r\n\r\ngoing  down as the result of the impending  British\r\n\r\nwithdrawal.  We  can  just imagine  the  plight  of\r\n\r\nthousands  of our workers thrown out of  work  when\r\n\r\nthe British leave Singapore by the end of 1971. Not\r\n\r\nonly  will  the employees of the bases be affected,\r\n\r\nbut  also those who provide ancillary services like\r\n\r\ndomestic  servants, etc. Already, true unemployment\r\n\r\nis reckoned to total\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanywhere  between 52,000 and 100,000. To this  will\r\n\r\nbe  added another estimated 100,000 people who,  it\r\n\r\nis  calculated, will lose their jobs as a result of\r\n\r\nthe  withdrawal. This round figure  of  100,000  is\r\n\r\nmade  up  of  47,000 workers in the British  bases,\r\n\r\nincluding enlisted personnel and domestic servants,\r\n\r\nwho  will forfeit their jobs directly, plus another\r\n\r\n53,000 people who will be directly affected by  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of service expenditure here. The service\r\n\r\npresence directly or indirectly generates one-fifth\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's  Gross National Product  of  around\r\n\r\nS$3,200 million a year. The Forces' direct spending\r\n\r\nalone  accounts more than S$400 million a year.  In\r\n\r\naddition,    25,000   school-leavers   enter    the\r\n\r\nemployment  market every year. The process  may  be\r\n\r\nlikened to pulling off the main root of a plant for\r\n\r\ntransplanting which will undoubtedly damage some of\r\n\r\nthe  roothairs. The Government's task is to  ensure\r\n\r\nas little damage as possible when this main root is\r\n\r\nremoved.  That  is  why these radical  changes  are\r\n\r\nnecessary, however painful they may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present leadership has never faced a greater\r\n\r\nand  more  crucial test in its fight  for  economic\r\n\r\nsurvival  after  the announcements by  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment  last year that it intended to  withdraw\r\n\r\nall  its military commitments east of Suez.  During\r\n\r\nthis short period discussions between top Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  officers led by the Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\nBritish personnel have taken place and these  talks\r\n\r\nhave not only been fruitful but have also helped to\r\n\r\npave the way for Singapore's accelerated role as an\r\n\r\nindustrial nation. This kind of situation calls for\r\n\r\nprompt  and effective action. There is no time  for\r\n\r\nus  to  brood,  but to get down to work  since  our\r\n\r\nfuture is at stake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden flood of responsibilities thrust upon\r\n\r\nus  includes that of looking for sources of revenue\r\n\r\nin  order  to pay for the high defence expenditure.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1971 Singapore will have its squadron\r\n\r\nof  subsonic Hunter Mark Nines, flown  by  our  own\r\n\r\npilots,   now  beginning  their  initial  training.\r\n\r\nSingapore cannot afford to carry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassengers  and  we want our people  to  carry  and\r\n\r\nshare  this  burden equally together through  these\r\n\r\ndifficult  years.  Singapore, being  important  not\r\n\r\nonly  as  a  sea  and  air  route  because  of  its\r\n\r\ngeographic position but also as the nerve centre of\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia,  must  and will  exploit  all  the\r\n\r\nresources  that  she  has  in  the  form  of  human\r\n\r\nexpertise and skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By introducing this Bill, we hope to be able to\r\n\r\nproduce  two or three times the goods and  services\r\n\r\nwe  have been producing now, and in return for  the\r\n\r\nmeaningful  sacrifice  made  by  the  workers,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment expects to provide better facilities for\r\n\r\nall. We cannot afford to allow our workers to go on\r\n\r\nstrike  to  ask  for increased wages especially  at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture, as has happened in some  countries\r\n\r\noverseas.  The United Kingdom Government  has  lost\r\n\r\nmillions  of  dollars  as a  result  of  industrial\r\n\r\naction during the last four months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore trust in\r\n\r\nthe  leadership of our Government. We must now make\r\n\r\nrealistic   approaches  to  ensure   the   economic\r\n\r\nsurvival  of  Singapore. The introduction  of  this\r\n\r\nBill  is  one way of fearlessly facing  up  to  the\r\n\r\nproblems  ahead.  Let  us hope  for  the  best  but\r\n\r\nprepare for the worst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmuch   has  been  said  in  this  Chamber  on  some\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Employment Bill.

If the employers  blatantly\r\n\r\nexploit  the workers, are we then to come  back  to\r\n\r\nthis Chamber again to repeal the present measure to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  exploitation of workers,  or  are  we\r\n\r\ngoing  to amend the labour laws every few years  to\r\n\r\nprevent employers or employees from exploiting each\r\n\r\nother?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that this P.A.P. Government has got\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the workers at heart. It  assists\r\n\r\nthem  to have a fair share of their labour  and  we\r\n\r\nalso  know  that  this  Government, too,  has  the\r\n\r\nreputation of allowing employers to have their just\r\n\r\ndue.   One   can  therefore  understand  that   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  these new  clauses  is  aimed  at\r\n\r\ngiving  a  boost  to  capital  investment  with   a\r\n\r\nresultant reduction in our unemployment. Of course,\r\n\r\nthere is no doubt that this is a good intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Bill will give most citizens employment\r\n\r\nand  in the long run the workers will be better off\r\n\r\nand the country as a whole will have prosperity. We\r\n\r\nall fully agree that this is what the Bill sets out\r\n\r\nto  do.  But intentions alone are not good  enough.\r\n\r\nThey  must be translated into realities.  Does  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  seriously  believe  that  some  of  the\r\n\r\nrestrictive clauses in this Bill will create a good\r\n\r\nindustrial climate? Is the Government sincerely  of\r\n\r\nthe  opinion that this Bill as it stands  now  will\r\n\r\nachieve  its objectives? I ask, can frustrated  and\r\n\r\ndisgruntled  workers give of their  best  and  thus\r\n\r\nincrease productivity? If the answer is \"No\" to the\r\n\r\nabove  three questions, then I suggest to the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour that he must be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconcede to the amendments proposed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  some of us here. But, on the other hand, if the\r\n\r\nMinister is of the opinion that the answers  to  my\r\n\r\nthree  questions are \"Yes\", then I am  prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept this Bill in toto. This Government, I  know,\r\n\r\nhowever,  is too honest to give a dishonest  reply. [Laughter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not stand here because some fringe benefits\r\n\r\nhave been taken away from the workers, but if, as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the sacrifices made by them,  there  is\r\n\r\noverall benefit to Singapore, then I am all for it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some of the sacrifices made  by  the\r\n\r\nworkers would only go towards enriching some of the\r\n\r\nunenlightened  employers  who  would  invest  their\r\n\r\nsavings not in industries, but in their big  houses\r\n\r\nand  property, thereby increasing their own  wealth\r\n\r\nwithout  any direct benefit either to Singapore  or\r\n\r\nto   the  workers.  On  the  other  hand,  if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can assure us that savings will  accrue\r\n\r\nas  a  result  of this Bill by lowering  production\r\n\r\ncosts  and  that the profits made will be  ploughed\r\n\r\nback  into  industry  thereby increasing  the  work\r\n\r\nforce,  I am fully in support of the workers making\r\n\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also obvious that one of the objectives of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill is to increase the wealth of the country\r\n\r\nby  attracting foreign investors because  of  lower\r\n\r\nproduction  costs. The Government also  hopes  that\r\n\r\nthese  foreign  investors will  plough  back  their\r\n\r\nprofits  into  industry,  thereby  increasing  work\r\n\r\nopportunities   for   our  school-leavers.   Highly\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries like Russia, America,  England,\r\n\r\nWest  Germany and Japan have reached their  present\r\n\r\nstandards  because  of  the utter  exploitation  of\r\n\r\nworkers  during  the  nineteenth  century.     The\r\n\r\ncapitalists in those countries, while getting  rich\r\n\r\nat  the  expense of the workers, did not forget  to\r\n\r\nplough  back their profits into industry.  But  the\r\n\r\nsame  cannot  be  said here in Singapore.  Are  the\r\n\r\nforeign  capitalists also prepared to  plough  back\r\n\r\nsome of their profits into expanding the industry\r\n\r\nand helping us to reduce our unemployment? This  is\r\n\r\nvery doubtful. I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned   that  capitalists  in  the   nineteenth\r\n\r\ncentury  exploited  the workers and  ploughed  back\r\n\r\ntheir  profits into industry not because they  had\r\n\r\nsympathy  for  labour but because of their  selfish\r\n\r\nmotive  to  make still more money.  But  this  evil\r\n\r\nmotive  did,  in fact, bring good to  the  country.\r\n\r\nMore  workers were employed and industry  expanded.\r\n\r\nThe  workers  in  these countries today  are-really\r\n\r\nreaping the harvest made possible by the sacrifices\r\n\r\nmade  by  their  fore-fathers. Can the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment assure us that the employers who are now\r\n\r\ngiven  advantages by the introduction of this  Bill\r\n\r\nwill do what the capitalists did in the countries I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned, that is, plough back their profits\r\n\r\ninto  industry?  I am not asking the  investors  to\r\n\r\nsacrifice  their profits, but I am only asking  the\r\n\r\nemployers to reinvest their money so that they  can\r\n\r\nmake  more  money and at the same time  reduce  our\r\n\r\nunemployment figure which stands at nine  per  cent\r\n\r\ntoday in the active labour market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year there are 20,000 school-leavers and in\r\n\r\nfive  years there will be 100,000 young adults  who\r\n\r\nshould  have been absorbed in industry. Our workers\r\n\r\nare not beyond understanding of these problems. The\r\n\r\nsacrifices  asked of them must be worth  while  and\r\n\r\nthey  will be prepared to make more sacrifices,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, if they are assured that their  children\r\n\r\nwill   reap  the  harvest  as  a  result  of  their\r\n\r\nsacrifices  today. If after having made  sacrifices\r\n\r\nthere is within the next five years no reduction in\r\n\r\nour  unemployment  figure, then  the  workers, are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  ask  us,  \"What have  we sacrificed  our\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits  for?\"  Only  the  investors  have\r\n\r\nbecome rich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must induce confidence in the\r\n\r\nworking  class  if it wants them to  give  up  some\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits. It can only do this by seeing  to\r\n\r\nit  that  the  employers also play their  part  by\r\n\r\nexpanding   their  industry  and   providing   more\r\n\r\nemployment.   If   this   is   not    done,    then\r\n\r\ndisillusionment  must  set in and the  propaganda  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists   will   provide  an   alternative   for\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us not forget this point. Workers alone\r\n\r\ncannot  be held responsible for the economic  well-being  of the country. Employers, and others,  too,\r\n\r\nmust  be  called upon to play their  role  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  the  Government should  enact  laws  to\r\n\r\ncompel  investors  to plough  back  some  of  their\r\n\r\nprofits  into industry annually. If this is  not done,  then  what  will happen is  that  while  the\r\n\r\nworkers  have sacrificed fringe benefits, investors\r\n\r\nmake  more  money and unemployment  increases.  The\r\n\r\nCommunists  will be able to exploit  the  situation\r\n\r\nand we will all be in trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on some\r\n\r\nof  the clauses here. What I cannot understand  are\r\n\r\nthe precise reasons for the introduction of some of\r\n\r\nthe new provisions in the Bill. Let us consider  at\r\n\r\nthis  stage  the  exact nature of the  new  clauses\r\n\r\nintroduced, such as clause 15, which seeks  to  fix\r\n\r\nthe age of retirement for all and sundry at\r\n\r\n55.  The Hon. Minister in his policy speech did not\r\n\r\nadduce  one  single reason why this should  be  so.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that the Government hopes to achieve for\r\n\r\nthe  country through the introduction of clause 15?\r\n\r\nWhat medical evidence, if any, has the Minister  to\r\n\r\nbe  so  categorical that a person should retire  at\r\n\r\nthe  age of 55 as opposed to any other age? As  for\r\n\r\nthe  ill effects of the clause on all concerned,  I\r\n\r\nthink enough has been said by my colleagues. I need\r\n\r\nnot elaborate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I wish to draw the Minister's attention to\r\n\r\nclause  42  - for all this, of course, the  present\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour is not responsible; the  former\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour is responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is collective\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes. We too were responsible to\r\n\r\nsome  extent!  Now  I wish to touch  on  clause  43\r\n\r\n(annual leave) and clause 44 (sick leave). The Bill\r\n\r\npurports  to  standardise annual heave  at  a  flat\r\n\r\nseven days and 14 days irrespective of the type  of\r\n\r\njob  a  man  does. I am all for standardisation  of\r\n\r\nbenefits  as  between industrial and non-industrial\r\n\r\nworkers. But why has the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  not  taken  into account  the  prevailing\r\n\r\npractice in the public and private sectors  whereby\r\n\r\nthe  employers, of their own volition, grant  leave\r\n\r\nup  to a maximum of 21 days - and even 21 days  for\r\n\r\nthe  industrial workers? In the first  place,  have\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants  in  the  Ministry  of  Labour\r\n\r\ncompiled  statistics on this matter? I  am  certain\r\n\r\nthat  they  have not done so. On what research  has\r\n\r\nthe  Minister based seven days' and 14 days'  leave\r\n\r\nprovision  other than on the demand of a few  local\r\n\r\nemployers?   Can  he  prove  to  this  House   that\r\n\r\nirrespective  of the nature of the work  a  man  is\r\n\r\nengaged  in,  14 days' annual leave  is  absolutely\r\n\r\nsufficient  for a worker at the age  of  50  or  50\r\n\r\nplus?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, on the sick leave provision, where\r\n\r\nare  the Minister's facts and figures to show abuse\r\n\r\namongst  employees  in  the  private  sector?   For\r\n\r\ninstance,   I   myself  work  for  a  big   private\r\n\r\nenterprise and my employers have never had occasion\r\n\r\nto  complain  to me or against me as a trade  union\r\n\r\npresident that my colleagues who work with me  take\r\n\r\nexcessive   medical  leave   or   that   they   are\r\n\r\nmalingerers.  How many complaints has his  Ministry\r\n\r\nreceived  from  private sector  employers  to  this\r\n\r\neffect?  If so, who are the employers? What  is  so\r\n\r\nmagical  about  the  14 days' intermittent  medical\r\n\r\nleave?  Presumably the Minister  has  taken  advice\r\n\r\nfrom  medical experts on averages. If so, would  he\r\n\r\ncare  to  reveal the details of any such study?  As\r\n\r\nfor  the arbitrary figure of 28 days' leave  for  hospitalisation, I need only say this.  Even  the\r\n\r\ndoctors in the hospitals are clearly shocked.  They\r\n\r\nsay. \"What rubbish is this 28 days!\" This provision\r\n\r\nlacks  not only research on the matter but shows  a\r\n\r\ncomplete absence of common sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my other trade union colleagues\r\n\r\nhave  said, \"We are prepared to make the  necessary\r\n\r\nsacrifices,  but not without assessing the  precise\r\n\r\nnature  of  the  sacrifices we are called  upon  to\r\n\r\nmake.\"  If  I  am  asked to make  sacrifices,  like\r\n\r\nreturning to work half-way through sickness or from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreatment  in the hospital, at least I am  entitled\r\n\r\nto question the wisdom of such a demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 47 is the controversial bonus clause\r\n\r\nremoving bonus payments to workers. I need not have\r\n\r\nto  elaborate much on this. The other day  I  asked\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Labour if it could give me any good\r\n\r\nreason  for the Government's interfering with  free\r\n\r\nnegotiation on bonuses between trade unions and the\r\n\r\nmanagement.  There  seemed to  be  no  satisfactory\r\n\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in this Chamber have to take full\r\n\r\nresponsibility for any repercussions that may arise\r\n\r\nas  a result of this Employment Bill. Let us not be\r\n\r\nhasty about passing it; otherwise it will be a case\r\n\r\nof  acting in haste and repenting at leisure. I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to consider seriously the  amendments\r\n\r\nthat will be moved by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee.\r\n\r\nThese  amendments have been tabled not so  much  to\r\n\r\nincrease benefits for the workers as in the sincere\r\n\r\nbelief  that  they will remove any discontent  from\r\n\r\nthe  minds and hearts of the workers and they  will\r\n\r\nrise  to  the occasion and give of their utmost  in\r\n\r\nthe  interest  not  only of  themselves  and  their\r\n\r\nchildren but of the nation as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, what is really striking in the discussion that\r\n\r\nhas  taken  place on this Bill up till now  is  the\r\n\r\nremarkable  degree of sobriety with which  we  have\r\n\r\ndiscussed it. Perhaps this is due to the increasing\r\n\r\nawareness that politics in Singapore now is  not  a\r\n\r\nventure  in recklessness but that it is the science\r\n\r\nof the possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present historical context, I believe there\r\n\r\nare two main factors which have conspired with each\r\n\r\nother  to  make  the  introduction  of  this   Bill\r\n\r\ninevitable.  The  first is the increasing  need  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up a completely rationalised economic system\r\n\r\nthat  would  in toto, not merely in its  parts,  be\r\n\r\nable to compete with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  economies of countries such as. Hong Kong  and\r\n\r\nJapan   who   are   our   main   competitors    for\r\n\r\ninternational markets. This first factor is  merely\r\n\r\nthe function of the second one which is the need to\r\n\r\nconvert our society into art industrial society  as\r\n\r\nswiftly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few specifics when one talks about the\r\n\r\nindustrial  society which needs to be created.  All\r\n\r\nover  the  developing  world,  the  under-developed\r\n\r\nworld  or  the  backward  world,  the  ambition  of\r\n\r\ngovernments is to create as quickly as possible  an\r\n\r\nindustrial  society  with  a  manufacturing   base.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is difficult to define clearly what  is\r\n\r\nmeant  by an industrial society, there are a number\r\n\r\nof attributes that can be pinpointed. Primarily, it\r\n\r\nis the application of a scientific mentality to the\r\n\r\nproduction   process.  Secondly,  to   change   the\r\n\r\npsychology  of  the  human beings,  especially  the\r\n\r\nworkers, who participate in the industrial process.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  to convert the individual  digit\r\n\r\nthat  works  in the factory itself, to  change  its\r\n\r\nattitude  towards work and play, and to change  its\r\n\r\nattitude  towards tools, which means that  we  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  create the scientific capability. We  will\r\n\r\nhave  to create a manufacturing capacity which will\r\n\r\nbuild the tools which will set up the factories and\r\n\r\nproduce the machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways in which industrialisation in a\r\n\r\ncountry  can  be induced. One is indigenously  from\r\n\r\nthe inside which is the method that has obtained in\r\n\r\nthe  Western countries and possibly Japan, and  the\r\n\r\nother  one is to induce industrialisation from  the\r\n\r\noutside,  from  impulses from  developed  countries\r\n\r\ninto  the  developing country,  which  is  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening   all   over   the   world   today.   We,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  because  of  our  serious  physical\r\n\r\nlimitations and our lack of scientific capabilities\r\n\r\nfor    the    purpose    of    inducing    internal\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, belong to the  second  category.\r\n\r\nAnd   a   price  has  got  to  be  paid  for  this.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the price that we have  got  to  pay\r\n\r\ntoday  is  this  Bill.  It may  not  be  completely\r\n\r\nhumanistic  in terms of the minimum standards  that\r\n\r\nobtain in advanced countries, but at least, as  has\r\n\r\nbeen pointed out by a number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeakers,  it  is  humanistic in relation  to  what\r\n\r\nobtains in surrounding countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The factors that really stand in the way of the\r\n\r\nconversion into an industrial society are manifold,\r\n\r\nespecially in developing countries. The first  one,\r\n\r\nof  course, is a backward leadership that does  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  modernism. Secondly, the  allowance  in\r\n\r\nthe  political process of the emergence  of  ghosts\r\n\r\nfrom   the   past.   In  other  words,   linguistic\r\n\r\nchauvinism  in  a  multi-racial  society,  communal\r\n\r\nclashes and the lack of ability on the part of  the\r\n\r\npolitical  leadership  to  organise  scientifically\r\n\r\ntheir  policies in such a way as to  mute  whatever\r\n\r\nconflicts and contradictions there might be between\r\n\r\ncommunities and languages. And\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworse   still   is  corruption  in   high   places,\r\n\r\nespecially among the political leadership and among\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  and  others who  go  into  politics\r\n\r\nbecause they feel it is a very attractive business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
