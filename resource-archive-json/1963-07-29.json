Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the period\r\n\r\nbetween  3rd  June, 1959 and 31st July,  1961,  493\r\n\r\nhawkers were summoned before the police courts  for\r\n\r\nhawking offences and the total of the fines imposed\r\n\r\nby the courts was $4,140.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this period, no sort of positive action\r\n\r\nwas  taken  to  help  the hawkers,  and  conditions\r\n\r\nbecame  chaotic especially in congested  areas  and\r\n\r\naround  the  markets and street-corners,  with  the\r\n\r\nresult  that market stallholders left their  stalls\r\n\r\nin the markets and shop-keepers left their shops to\r\n\r\ncompete  with the hawkers outside the  markets  and\r\n\r\nshops and in street-corners. In this situation of a\r\n\r\nfree-for-all  which did not serve the  interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  hawkers themselves, the Hawkers Department was\r\n\r\ntoo  afraid to discharge their normal duties to the\r\n\r\nhawkers and to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the period 1st August 1961, to 30th June,\r\n\r\n1963, 3,214 hawkers were summoned before the police\r\n\r\ncourts  for hawking offences and the total  of  the\r\n\r\nfines imposed by the courts was $33,763.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the second period under reference, a new\r\n\r\npolicy  for  the resiting of hawkers on alternative\r\n\r\nsites  off the main roads and markets was  adopted.\r\n\r\nThe  new  sites  they occupy are  chosen  in  close\r\n\r\nproximity  to the places from where they  had  been\r\n\r\nremoved  so  as to ensure the least dislocation  to\r\n\r\ntheir  business. Every hawker who is to be  removed\r\n\r\nfrom  a clearance site is registered and is assured\r\n\r\nof  a place in the new site. The places in the  new\r\n\r\nsites are drawn for in a ballot held in public. The\r\n\r\nsites  are  properly marked out and laid  out  with\r\n\r\nstandpipes to facilitate daily cleansing. Bins  are\r\n\r\nalso provided at such sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hawkers were also, in this second period,\r\n\r\nfor the first time, given a proprietary interest in\r\n\r\nthe  sites they occupied which they could  transfer\r\n\r\nto  others for a consideration when they decided to\r\n\r\ngive   up   their  business  or  which   could   be\r\n\r\ntransferred  to members of their family  when  they\r\n\r\ndie.  Previously in such circumstances, their sites\r\n\r\nwere  declared  to  be vacant  and  were  given  to\r\n\r\nnewcomers on the results of a ballot. Under the new\r\n\r\nsystem,   all  opportunities  for  graft   in   the\r\n\r\nallocation  of pitches and hawker sites  have  been\r\n\r\neliminated,  as the hawker himself  gets  the  best\r\n\r\nprice  for  his site and his family gets  the  site\r\n\r\nwhen  he  dies. Under the present system also,  the\r\n\r\nhawker who actually does the business on a site  is\r\n\r\nlicensed  and  if  subletting  is  discovered,  the\r\n\r\nperson actually doing the business gets the licence\r\n\r\ntransferred to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board has also embarked on a very\r\n\r\nenlightened  policy of building hawker  pitches  in\r\n\r\nthe Board's estates which are rented to the hawkers\r\n\r\non   small  instalments  to  cover  their  cost  of\r\n\r\nconstruction over a period of three years and which\r\n\r\nbecome the property of the hawker at the end of the\r\n\r\nperiod.  Thereafter, the hawker only pays a nominal\r\n\r\nrent of $1 per month for the site which is his  and\r\n\r\nwhich he can transfer to others for a consideration\r\n\r\nor which passes to his family when he dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in furtherance of the scheme for a\r\n\r\nfair  deal  for hawkers, they have been allowed  to\r\n\r\nply their trade in various parts of the city and in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas at nights and in selected locations\r\n\r\nonce a week where their presence does not cause any\r\n\r\ntraffic obstruction and where they can find a ready\r\n\r\nmarket for their goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a result of the enlightened policy\r\n\r\nfollowed in regard to hawkers in the second period,\r\n\r\nthe   hawker  situation  in  the  town  has   shown\r\n\r\nconsiderable  improvement. The  Government  regrets\r\n\r\nthe  need for enforcing the law on hawking but this\r\n\r\naction has had to be taken in the interests of both\r\n\r\nthe hawkers themselves and the public and has been\r\n\r\nreduced to the very minimum. Where new hawkers come\r\n\r\nto  sites  where hawkers have been resited,  action\r\n\r\nhas obviously to be taken against them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\notherwise  there  would be no point  in  proceeding\r\n\r\nwith resiting schemes. Also where hawkers ply their\r\n\r\ntrade at street-corners or on streets which because\r\n\r\nof  the  heavy traffic are restricted  to  hawkers,\r\n\r\naction  has  obviously  to be  taken  to  keep  the\r\n\r\nstreets free for traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with the new deal that the Government has given\r\n\r\nto the hawkers, the Government has been able to get\r\n\r\ntheir  co-operation in keeping the city clean.  The\r\n\r\nhawkers  themselves understand that if the  law  is\r\n\r\nnot  enforced  in a fair and reasonable  manner,  a\r\n\r\nfree-for-all situation develops which does  not  in\r\n\r\nthe long run serve their own interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I would like to understand why  there\r\n\r\nis  a great difference between the fines imposed in\r\n\r\none  period and those imposed in the other  period.\r\n\r\nIn  the  period  between 3rd June, 1959,  and  31st\r\n\r\nJuly, 1961, the fines were less than those for  the\r\n\r\nperiod  between  1st August, 1961, and  30th  June,\r\n\r\n1963. The time lapse between the two periods is not\r\n\r\nvery   great.  Why  is  there  also  such  a  great\r\n\r\ndifference in the number of hawkers arrested during\r\n\r\nthe two respective periods? It may be an indication\r\n\r\nthat after 31st July, 1961, the Government did  not\r\n\r\nlook after the interest of the hawkers well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, have already answered\r\n\r\nthe  question.

It  would\r\n\r\nappear that there was some misunderstanding and not\r\n\r\nunnatural concern regarding religious liberty after\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   I  therefore  undertook   to   make   a\r\n\r\ndeclaration  on religious freedom on my  return  to\r\n\r\nSingapore in this Assembly. It has always been  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the  Government of Singapore  to  allow\r\n\r\nfreedom of all religions in Singapore, and I gladly\r\n\r\ngive the assurance that we will continue the policy\r\n\r\nof religious toleration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of other religions than the Muslims will\r\n\r\nappreciate that the Singapore (Constitution)  Order\r\n\r\nin  Council,  1958, makes it the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government of Singapore to protect, safeguard,\r\n\r\nsupport,   foster,  and  promote   the   political,\r\n\r\neducational,   religious,  economic,   social   and\r\n\r\ncultural    interests   of   the    Malays.    This\r\n\r\nresponsibility will remain after Malaysia  Day,  as\r\n\r\nit  will be included in the Singapore Constitution.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  over-riding safeguard for  religious\r\n\r\nfreedom is contained in Article\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11 of the Federal Constitution, which provides that\r\n\r\nevery  person has the right to profess and practise\r\n\r\nhis  religion,  it is the policy of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  maintain  the  status  quo  in  all\r\n\r\nmatters of religious freedom, in other words, there\r\n\r\nwill be no change after Malaysia. Article 11(4)   of\r\n\r\nthe  Federal  Constitution does give power  to  the\r\n\r\nState to control or restrict the propagation of any\r\n\r\nreligious   doctrine  or  belief  amongst   persons\r\n\r\nprofessing  the Muslim religion. And Article  11(1) \r\n\r\nof  the  Constitution provides that  the  right  to\r\n\r\npropagate  the  religion shall be subject  to  this\r\n\r\npower.  The  power will be exercised by  the  State\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  provisions  of  the   Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution  in  this  matter  cannot  be  amended\r\n\r\nwithout the consent of the Singapore Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not possible for me to bind all future\r\n\r\ngovernments in Singapore, but I give the  assurance\r\n\r\nthat  it  is not the intention of my Government  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  legislation to control or  restrict  the\r\n\r\npropagation  of any religious doctrine  or  belief,\r\n\r\nand   the  present  position  in  all  matters   of\r\n\r\nreligious liberty will continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BREACH OF PRIVILEGE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Member for Queenstown is guilty of\r\n\r\ndishonourable  conduct and abuse  of  privilege  in\r\n\r\nthat  he did on the 14th day of June, 1963, in this\r\n\r\nHouse  maliciously and falsely attack the integrity\r\n\r\nof   the  Minister  for  Finance  by  making   the\r\n\r\nfollowing statement:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I remember reading in the newspaper about the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance going  along  to  open  the\r\n\r\n`National  Tower'  for  the  firm  Matsushita   or\r\n\r\nsomething  like that.

I hope, in the course of the debate but\r\n\r\ncertainly  before  adoption  by  this  House.   The\r\n\r\nposition is as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who have read the exchange of letters will\r\n\r\nbe  aware  that there were certain changes conceded\r\n\r\nand  agreed  to on the 8th July, the  day  when  we\r\n\r\nsigned  or  initialled the Agreement in London.  In\r\n\r\nseveral cases, as in the case of one document which\r\n\r\nwas  signed by the Prime Minister of the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya, it was not agreed to till 9.15  on  the\r\n\r\nevening  when we signed the Agreement.

I   would   have\r\n\r\npreferred to have all these amendments included  in\r\n\r\nthe  document  presented,  but  I  think  time   is\r\n\r\npressing and I have undertaken to introduce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  amendments before the provisions  are  adopted\r\n\r\nand then to produce a clean copy of the final Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

We foregathered at  about  a\r\n\r\nquarter to twelve. After 9.15 when we agreed at the\r\n\r\nRitz,  quite appropriately. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of the Federation took us all out to\r\n\r\ndinner  to  a  place called the  Omar  Khayaam.  We\r\n\r\nforegathered at Marlborough House at 11.30 and  did\r\n\r\nnot  get  down to business until 11.45.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nquite  sure  at  what exact time I  initialled  the\r\n\r\nAgreement, but I think there was some jesting  with\r\n\r\nsome  of the participants of that Conference as  to\r\n\r\nthe date of it, because when the last signature was\r\n\r\nappended,  the clock had moved on to  Tuesday,  the\r\n\r\n9th of July. I think, for purposes of propriety, as\r\n\r\nfar  as  I was concerned, it, was the 8th of July,.\r\n\r\nhut if the document says \"9th of July\", then so  be\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

One  is  purely  legal\r\n\r\ndraftsmanship.   The   legal   draftsman   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government, who has been seconded  from\r\n\r\nthe   British   Treasury,  has  suggested   certain\r\n\r\nimprovements in the syntax and phraseology of  some\r\n\r\nof  the Articles of the Constitution. There are  no\r\n\r\nsubstantial amendments, and I think the House  will\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to quibble if the Federation  wishes  to\r\n\r\ntake their draftsman's advice on these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are several other amendments of\r\n\r\nsubstance.  We  managed to have one  put  into  the\r\n\r\nBill.  Members  will  note that  when  the  general\r\n\r\nelections for 51 seats take place - it will  be  any\r\n\r\ntime  between  now  and  three  months  after  31st\r\n\r\nDecember, depending on the will of Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   - the   position  of   candidates   and\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  will no longer be quite the  same.  If\r\n\r\nthose  who  are elected on the party  platform  and\r\n\r\nbear  the party symbol break faith with the  Party,\r\n\r\neither by resigning or by being expelled, then they\r\n\r\nautomatically vacate their seats in this  Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  there will be  no  more  musical\r\n\r\nchairs  in  this Chamber. The next election  is  an\r\n\r\nelection  to decide who is to govern for  the  next\r\n\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other important amendments. One,\r\n\r\nMembers  will notice, is contained in  a  letter  I\r\n\r\nwrote  to the Tunku, enclosing a document he signed\r\n\r\nin  which  it  has been agreed that  the  power  to\r\n\r\ndetain  gangsters  even after merger  and  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwill rest with the Singapore Government. This is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  some  importance,  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,\r\n\r\nparticularly  as we know that in certain  parts  of\r\n\r\nthe  country  and certainly before 1959,  gangsters\r\n\r\nplayed an important role\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  elections. Well, I am afraid they will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  do  so  at  the next  general  elections,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  be before merger or after merger.  The\r\n\r\npower,  the executive authority, under the Criminal\r\n\r\nLaw  (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance,  rests  with\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government. I think it is to the good\r\n\r\nof  the peace and good order of this country. I  am\r\n\r\nsorry  some  Members  on the other  side  may  have\r\n\r\nfriends  who  were in Pulau Senang, but  they  will\r\n\r\nremain in custody. This is a matter of sufficiently\r\n\r\ngrave  importance for it is to be  carefully  spelt\r\n\r\nout in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the question of migration control. Under\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution  we  have  afforded  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  authority to prevent  specific  persons\r\n\r\nunder  the Restriction of Residence Ordinance  from\r\n\r\nstaying  in  a  particular  part  of  the  country.\r\n\r\nMembers will remember how one Said Zahari came back\r\n\r\nto  Singapore and suddenly found the ban across the\r\n\r\ncauseway. He then resided in Singapore and added to\r\n\r\nthe mischief that was then going on. Well, I think,\r\n\r\nin fairness, we should have a reciprocal right that\r\n\r\nwe shall have no more Fong Swee Suans, or, for that\r\n\r\nmatter,  Lim  Ching  Siong, whose  family  is  from\r\n\r\nPontian  and who will be proved ultimately to  have\r\n\r\ncome from Pontian; James Puthucheary, Mr Woodhull.\r\n\r\nMr  James  Puthucheary was a political  friend  of\r\n\r\nmine,  now  he is only a friend. I do not  see  why\r\n\r\nthey  should add mischief to Singapore. There  will\r\n\r\nbe  reciprocity. In other words, we will  keep  our\r\n\r\nbad  hats in Singapore if the Federation Government\r\n\r\nso  wills it, and we will have the right to request\r\n\r\nthe    Federation   Government   to   keep    their\r\n\r\nundesirables on the other side of the causeway.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way, I am quite sure Singapore will become  a\r\n\r\nmuch more peaceful and salubrious place. This power\r\n\r\nextends  not  only  to political undesirables,  but\r\n\r\nalso to secret society undesirables. It may be, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  that  just  before  the  election,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  held between now or  three  months\r\n\r\nafter the end of the year, trainloads of young men,\r\n\r\nwhose political skill Consists of the bicycle chain\r\n\r\nand  the knuckle duster, will come from places like\r\n\r\nIpoh, Penang and other parts of Malaya, where they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo not have the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)\r\n\r\nOrdinance to detain them. Members will notice  that\r\n\r\nevery time there is an election in a town, there is\r\n\r\nalways  an  anguished plea for  fair  play  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  I  leave Members  to  draw  their  own\r\n\r\nconclusions.  But I say, first of all,  we  do  not\r\n\r\nwant these gentlemen to come here either before  or\r\n\r\nduring  an  election. I know of several bus  owners\r\n\r\nwhose  business ramifications spread over the  rest\r\n\r\nof Malaya and who, I am quite sure, will be able to\r\n\r\nprovide  quite  a  number  of  cohorts  for   these\r\n\r\nmatters.  Youth  leaders, the Youth  League,  first\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  come here because we  will  have  the\r\n\r\nright to ask the Federation Government not to allow\r\n\r\nthem entry; secondly, if they do slip by, they will\r\n\r\nbe  detained  under  the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Ordinance.  Insofar  as   is   humanly\r\n\r\npossible, we will try to keep Singapore the  clean,\r\n\r\nsober and reasonable city that it always has been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons.

Members  will\r\n\r\nrecollect  that  as early as March this  year,  the\r\n\r\npublic  was  treated to the wonderful spectacle  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman of the Harbour Board instructing  the\r\n\r\npolice to go and nail up the premises of the  Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation,  and  then a few hours  later  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  saying that he was horrified,  and\r\n\r\nthat  he had instructed the Chairman of the Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard not to do such naughty things. All this  sort\r\n\r\nof  play-acting really brings the P.A.P nowhere. It\r\n\r\njust  makes people laugh. Here was the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe Harbour Board, a Permanent Secretary, doing the\r\n\r\nthing  which  he  thought was what  the  Government\r\n\r\nwanted, and here was the Prime Minister saying that\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman  of the Harbour Board should  not  do\r\n\r\nsuch  a  naughty thing. That was the start  of  the\r\n\r\ntussle for power between the P.A.P. and the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  for  the Harbour Board Staff Association:\r\n\r\nbetween,  as they would like it to be described  in\r\n\r\nmore trade union terms, the N.T.U.C. and S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in May, as the matter could not be settled\r\n\r\namicably,  the  Prime Minister, who  had  been  the\r\n\r\nlegal  adviser to the Singapore Harbour Board Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation  for  many, many  years  in  the  past,\r\n\r\ncalled  a  meeting  of  the  two  factions  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board Staff Association. He tried - he  really  did - to bring peace. He told these  two\r\n\r\nfactions  that  they should go back,  talk  matters\r\n\r\nover,  and come to some decision whereby they could\r\n\r\nprotect the interests of the workers. But, and this\r\n\r\nis  what  he  warned them, they  should  not  allow\r\n\r\nthemselves to be made use of by pro-Communists  who\r\n\r\nwere  just around the corner trying to cash  in  on\r\n\r\nthe situation in an endeavour to damage Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it really tickled me. I have been in the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Council since 1948,  and  the  British\r\n\r\ncolonial  government, whenever they  met  with  any\r\n\r\ntrouble  from  the  trade unions,  always  smelt  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  behind  every  tree.  \"Ha,  this  is   a\r\n\r\nCommunist  trade  union.  Ha,  so  and  so   is   a\r\n\r\nCommunist.\"  And the Prime Minister, who  was  with\r\n\r\nthat  union  for many, many years  and  who,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  support given by that  union,  won\r\n\r\nresoundingly  in  the Tanjong Pagar  election,  the\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar by-election, and yet another Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar election, and was carried on the shoulders of\r\n\r\nJamit  Singh as a great victor - and now poor  Jamit\r\n\r\nSingh  is under detention by the same man  whom  he\r\n\r\nchaired -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> By your friend, the Tunku.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - now smells a Communist behind\r\n\r\nevery tree. Their boys have just found out that the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board Staff Association,  because\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have found difficulty  in  controlling\r\n\r\nthem to their way of thinking, are now getting into\r\n\r\nthe hands of the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two factions, as I have said, went back and I\r\n\r\ndo  not know what they did; whether they did try to\r\n\r\nresolve  their differences; but it would seem  that\r\n\r\nthey  could not resolve their differences.  In  May\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister found it difficult to drum some\r\n\r\nsense  into the group of trade unionists who  would\r\n\r\nnot follow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. party line. He gave  them  a  sort  of\r\n\r\nultimatum, \"Unless you boys behave, you watch out!\"\r\n\r\nAlthough  he did not use the same memorable  phrase - \"I  can fix you, but you cannot fix me!\" - it meant\r\n\r\nthe same thing. \"You boys watch out!\" He told these\r\n\r\ntwo  groups and I do not know whether they did  try\r\n\r\nto  resolve  their differences. But it  would  seem\r\n\r\nthat  things have gone from bad to worse. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  thought that something must  be  done  to\r\n\r\nteach these boys, who would not listen to the great\r\n\r\nwords  of  wisdom  of the Prime Minister,  a  much-needed lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble between the two groups was not\r\n\r\nresolved. But then the one group that did  not  owe\r\n\r\nallegiance  to the P.A.P. decided that they  should\r\n\r\ngive  an  ultimatum to the Harbour  Board  to  have\r\n\r\ntheir demands finalised within a certain period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That really got the Prime Minister wild. He went\r\n\r\nto  the  Harbour Board, and with the P.A.P. radio,\r\n\r\nP.A.P. television,  and  P.A.P. newspapers   too\r\n\r\nshowing  pictures, it would seem  that  there  were\r\n\r\n10,000  workers,  with mouths  opened  and  gaping,\r\n\r\nlistening  to  the words of wisdom from  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  At that meeting, he said, \"Boys,  better\r\n\r\nwatch out. If you go on strike, the strike will  be\r\n\r\ncalled off within two days.\" I do not know what  he\r\n\r\nmeant  by  that. Obviously if there  was  to  be  a\r\n\r\nstrike, the Government would take action and put an\r\n\r\nend  to  it. And this came from the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwhose   political  strength  came  from  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions. A man who fought me when I was there  - thou\r\n\r\nshalt not do this; thou shalt not do that - is doing\r\n\r\nthe  things that he told me that I should  not  do.\r\n\r\nTimes  change, temperaments change, and even  ideas\r\n\r\nchange.  I  cannot blame the Prime Minister  if  he\r\n\r\nfeels that he should now do the things that he said\r\n\r\nI  should not do. So he said he addressed  the  big\r\n\r\nmeeting of 10,000 workers. I am not so uncharitable\r\n\r\nas  to  suggest that the gates were closed and  the\r\n\r\npeople were shepherded there, that even some of the\r\n\r\npeople  who  listened to him  were  from  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  and  they were not members of the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard.   Let  it  be.  There  were  10,000   people\r\n\r\nlistening.  But  this is what  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You boys. Do not listen to all this. Do not go  on\r\n\r\nstrike,  if the strike is not over in two  days,  I\r\n\r\nknow who they are. These 300 or 500 people will  be\r\n\r\nin  trouble. But if you behave, I shall give you an\r\n\r\ninterim award.\" Where is the Harbour Board?  Is  it\r\n\r\nan  autonomous  body or is it not, with  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  saying.  \"I  shall give  you  an  interim\r\n\r\naward.\"?  He said so on Tuesday, \"I shall  give  an\r\n\r\ninterim  award.\" The boys raised their  hands.  Who\r\n\r\ndoes  not want money? Cheers. \"Hurray, great  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  I  am  going to  get  an  ang  pau.\"  So\r\n\r\neverybody  raised  his hands. So the  photographers\r\n\r\nwho  were there when the people raised their  hands\r\n\r\nsnapped the picture, and it came out with everybody\r\n\r\nraising  his hands for the great ang pau  from  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister who, at that particular  time,  was\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman and members of the Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  all rolled into one. That was what the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister was when he announced that. Then  he  came\r\n\r\nand  said, \"I do not think there will be  a  strike\r\n\r\nbecause  I believe in the good sense of the workers\r\n\r\nof the Harbour Board.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything went on nicely for two or three days.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he found that this troublesome group, as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  evil  machinations of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson, still would not bow down to him. They were\r\n\r\ntrying  to call a meeting, trying to take a  ballot\r\n\r\nof  the  port workers as to whether a strike should\r\n\r\ntake  place or not. The Prime Minister had  another\r\n\r\nmeeting.  \"Boys, boys, look at this. Do not  listen\r\n\r\nto all this. I give you a Malaysia bonus.\" Malaysia\r\n\r\nbonus!  The Prime Minister giving a Malaysia bonus!\r\n\r\n\"I  have  deregistered the Singapore Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nStaff  Association.\" Sir, everything  is  \"I\".  The\r\n\r\ngreat Prime Minister! Where is the body that is  to\r\n\r\nconsider whether this interim award should be given\r\n\r\nor  not?  Is  not  the Singapore Harbour  Board  an\r\n\r\nautonomous body? The Minister who is to say whether\r\n\r\na  trade union is to be deregistered or not is  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour.  But  here  was  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister who says. \"I - I - I.\" Everything  is  \"I\".\r\n\r\nEven in London -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

He is also the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance! He said, \"I will give  you  a\r\n\r\nMalaysia  award.\" If I were uncharitable,  I  would\r\n\r\nsay.  \"Ah, the Prime Minister is giving a  Malaysia\r\n\r\naward  because of elections, is it not?\" If I  were\r\n\r\nto  think  along  those lines, I would  say  it  is\r\n\r\nnothing but political corruption. I do not want  to\r\n\r\nthink  in that way. The Prime Minister can do  what\r\n\r\nhe  thinks  is good for him. I only hope  that  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, particularly the port workers,\r\n\r\nwill not be so foolish as to accept this sweet  and\r\n\r\nthink  that all the evil that the P.A.P. has  done\r\n\r\nfor  the  past  four years should be forgotten  and\r\n\r\nforgiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what makes matters worse in the industrial\r\n\r\nfield in Singapore today is this, Sir. Here was the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister saying that he was giving a Malaysia\r\n\r\naward.  He is now giving ideas to the trade  unions\r\n\r\nso  that they will be going to their employers  and\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"Ah, Malaysia is coming. I want a Malaysia\r\n\r\nang pau.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> So much so that the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister if he would say, as far as I could  gather\r\n\r\nfrom  the port workers, that the Malaysia award  is\r\n\r\npostponed, \"Tahan sekejap. Not so fast.\" It has not\r\n\r\nbeen  paid. It is up to him. If he says it is paid,\r\n\r\nI  shall be very happy for the workers. But it  has\r\n\r\nnot  been paid, because of the implication that  is\r\n\r\ncoming  in. A Malaysian ang pau is going to be  the\r\n\r\ndemand by trade unionists. And if trade unions from\r\n\r\nthe  S.A.T.U. group start demanding ang  paus.  \"My\r\n\r\nGod, it would mean the Communists again working  up\r\n\r\nindustrial  strife in Singapore and we should  lock\r\n\r\nthem all up.\" The Prime Minister might say that.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know. I met such \"activities\" of the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  during my time, when the Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  Staff Association was very ably led by Jamit\r\n\r\nSingh  - now under detention - and very ably  advised\r\n\r\nby  the  Prime  Minister, who was  then  the  legal\r\n\r\nadviser  of  the  Singapore  Harbour  Board   Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation,  and in spite of all the  evil  things\r\n\r\nthat they did against me, I had not the heart -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You had not the courage and\r\n\r\nguts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is not a question of courage,\r\n\r\nSir.

It is the greatest form of cowardice. Surely\r\n\r\nthat  is not courage.

But the great\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister does not believe in such democratic\r\n\r\npractice,  \"You cannot fix me. I can fix you.\"  The\r\n\r\npoor  Harbour Board Staff Association is now really\r\n\r\nfixed. What is more shocking is this. For the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  who believes in the right of association,\r\n\r\nfreedom of trade unions, to say to the workers  - on\r\n\r\nT.V. too, \"If you take two, Markandu - tidak apa. If\r\n\r\nthis  side has two, never mind. I will put in  two.\r\n\r\nSo  we have six new committee members. You can have\r\n\r\nthe union back.\" What is this'? Is this the way the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  plays with the trade  union?  \"You\r\n\r\nopposing group - you have two. My group has  two.  I\r\n\r\nput  in  two. Four against two. You can  have  your\r\n\r\nunion back.\" That is not the way to make use of the\r\n\r\nlaw  for  the benefit of the P.A.P. And  with  this\r\n\r\nT.V. it is wonderful. Every day you cannot open the\r\n\r\nT.V. set  and turn it on without seeing the  great\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister.  It  says, \"Ah,  our  great  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, the hero, Premier Lee Kuan Yew.\" And what\r\n\r\nmade me feel sorry for the Prime Minister was this:\r\n\r\nhere was the Prime Minister having Markandu sitting\r\n\r\nby  his  side with the T.V. on: \"Markandu, are  you\r\n\r\nfor Bani or are you for me? If you are for Bani, no\r\n\r\ninterim award for you.\" Is that the way to run  the\r\n\r\ngovernment? \"If you are for Bani, no interim  award\r\n\r\nfor you.\" Is the Prime Minister giving ideas to the\r\n\r\nemployers that unless the workers are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood to the employers, the employers can refuse  to\r\n\r\ngive   any  award.  Unfortunately  for  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  P.A.P. television just boomeranged.  \"If\r\n\r\nyou  are  for  Bani, you will not get  the  interim\r\n\r\naward.  If  you are for me, say so.\" And that  gave\r\n\r\nMarkandu the chance to say, \"I am not for Bani  nor\r\n\r\nam  I for Lee Kuan Yew. I am for the workers of the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board.\" There was a big  roar  and  a  big\r\n\r\nlaugh.   And   how   did  he  fix  this   Markandu?\r\n\r\nCitizenship withdrawn. But then over television  he\r\n\r\nsaid.   \"Markandu,  saya  tahu,  lah,   you   bukan\r\n\r\nCommunist.\" But why take away his citizenship if he\r\n\r\nis  not a Communist? Here again is another example\r\n\r\nof  the Prime Minister carrying out his threat,  \"I\r\n\r\ncan  fix  you,  but  you cannot  fix  me.\"  So  the\r\n\r\nOpposition knows all the tricks of the trade of the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to  fix  the  Opposition   while   the\r\n\r\nOpposition cannot fix the P.A.P. But the Opposition\r\n\r\ncan at any time knock out the P.A.P. The P.A.P. was\r\n\r\nknocked out at the last sitting of the Assembly and\r\n\r\nyet they have not admitted their defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\noften been accused by Members on the other side  of\r\n\r\nbeing  arrogant.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, you will also forgive me if I  cannot\r\n\r\nhelp  but show my disdain for those whose political\r\n\r\nfortune,  literally fortunes in dollars and  cents,\r\n\r\nmotivate their whole being. The Member says  he  is\r\n\r\nan anti-Communist; that I am a waverer, a ditherer.\r\n\r\nMy friends are non-Communists.

The  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson   dared  not  raise  it.  The  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  has  raised  it  on  a  motion  for  the\r\n\r\nadjournment.  It was fiat and punctured.  Would  he\r\n\r\nlike  me to do it the way he did it - incomprehension\r\n\r\nof  the problem, feeble? His knowledge of Communist\r\n\r\nphilosophy, strategy and tactics was negligible. He\r\n\r\nwas too busy preparing for the day when he would be\r\n\r\nout of office, like his colleagues now in the iron-mining  business. He is even now too busy  to  read\r\n\r\nthese   documents,  or  he  would  know   that   by\r\n\r\npostponing the elections till after Malaysia, he is\r\n\r\nnot   going   to  get  any  advantage.  Unthinking,\r\n\r\nplunging in to foolish decisions. Would he have  me\r\n\r\ndo  it  the way lie did it together with the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson? When the Harbour Board went on  strike,\r\n\r\nthe  port was paralysed for over two months. Troops\r\n\r\nhad to be called in. Industry and commerce came  to\r\n\r\na  grinding huh. Finally, when a general strike was\r\n\r\ncalled  in  1955, he had to arrest  Mr  Fong  Swee\r\n\r\nSuan. Let his memory not be so short. I was away at\r\n\r\nthat  time,  hut  I  was following  it  with  great\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> He\r\n\r\nwas the Minister for Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He was the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour.

One could\r\n\r\nbe  a  Minister by becoming a Senator, an appointed\r\n\r\none.  He will never learn to govern now.

He wants  to\r\n\r\nbuild  Kuala  Lumpur Airport for $50 million.  Just\r\n\r\nthink  of it, Mr Speaker, Sir, at 5 per cent,  one\r\n\r\ncould  retire and live ten lifetimes in comfort.  I\r\n\r\nsympathise   with  him.  These  are  his   personal\r\n\r\nproblems.  He has got four children to  educate  in\r\n\r\nEngland.  Why not make money? Why not  utilise  the\r\n\r\npower of the connections, the contacts he has made,\r\n\r\nwhen  he was Chief Minister? But I say to him  now,\r\n\r\nand  I  say  it  seriously, here and  outside  this\r\n\r\nChamber: do not meddle with the lives of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  We  will  fight  before  and  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Never  believe that because  the  police\r\n\r\nwill be under the control of the Central Government\r\n\r\nafter Malaysia, we will be deterred from saying and\r\n\r\nfrom doing what is right. Never believe that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my colleagues and I have this one great advantage - we have faced the ultimate. We faced it that night, here in 1961, when they all said it was phoney. That night we had to decide whether to fight the Communists or pack up. And fighting the Communists meant that if we lost, we\r\n\r\ndied.  And  a painful death: they do not just  take\r\n\r\nyou at dawn and shoot you or give you a last cup of\r\n\r\ncoffee and a cigarette. Thai is not the way they do\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we are relieved of all these mundane\r\n\r\nproblems of making a little bit of commission on $8\r\n\r\nmillion worth of aeroplanes and $50 million on  the\r\n\r\nAirport, and lots of other things besides  what  Ah\r\n\r\nHong  Construction  does in Kuala  Lumpur.  We  are\r\n\r\nrelieved  of these problems. We are not interested,\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,   Sir,  but  we   are   deeply   and\r\n\r\npassionately  interested  in  the  future  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry, and we will fight the Communists  and  the\r\n\r\nmerchant adventurers.

The\r\n\r\n15  seats  - he ganged up with the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nnot  knowing the immeasurable consequences of  that\r\n\r\ndecision.  I  have said this before,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  - he  is  a good poker player. I  have  played\r\n\r\npoker with him and the Tunku. I have, from time  to\r\n\r\ntime  in  the course of our deliberations,  had  to\r\n\r\nplay  poker with the Tunku, besides golf.  Golf  in\r\n\r\nthe   morning,  sometimes  poker  in  the  evening,\r\n\r\nsettlement in between, and sometimes on the back of\r\n\r\nan  envelope. But I did not play poker  to  win.  I\r\n\r\nplayed  poker to amuse my friends. And I am  not  a\r\n\r\ngood poker player. I do not like the game of bluff.\r\n\r\nWe  played bridge. When you know what your Opponent\r\n\r\nbids,  you  calculate very carefully what  are  the\r\n\r\npossibilities, and, most important, you come  to  a\r\n\r\nconclusion on the probabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we put the 15 seats. This is by way of\r\n\r\nillustration  to  show how silly  he  is.  He  will\r\n\r\nforever  regret this. As an act, he took  our  Bill\r\n\r\naway,  but I think it would have made no difference\r\n\r\nif  I  had  been  here. He had orders  from  above,\r\n\r\naccording  to today's afternoon newspapers,  as  he\r\n\r\nmust   from  time  to  time.  Does  he   know   the\r\n\r\nconsequences of that? The 15 seats - we  tested  the\r\n\r\nground  with the Communists, and had them. See  the\r\n\r\ndifference  between September last year  arid  now.\r\n\r\nReferendum Day - 25 per cent - let us see  how  much\r\n\r\nthey  have got and where it is, and let us work  on\r\n\r\nit. And there is no danger attached to it; no power\r\n\r\nis attached to winning the 15 seats. By his foolish\r\n\r\nmove,  which we also contemplated - we credited  him\r\n\r\nwith   more   intelligence  and   said   that   the\r\n\r\npossibility was 50-50 whether he would block it  or\r\n\r\nwhether he would allow it. I think I over-rated his\r\n\r\nintelligence or perhaps these were things  not  for\r\n\r\nhim  to  decide  but for higher authority.  Now  he\r\n\r\nfaces a contest for 51 seats, with power attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hate to interrupt the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, but I think I must bring him back now  to\r\n\r\nthe industrial dispute of the port workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In the same way this is a\r\n\r\nprelude to my explanation, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Sir.  By unthinking actions  he  has  led\r\n\r\nhimself  and  the country into dire peril,  because\r\n\r\nthese  51  seats have got power at the  end  of  it\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- $500 million worth of money every year controlled\r\n\r\nby  the Treasury plus radio, television, and a host\r\n\r\nof other things. If he wants it that way, so be it.\r\n\r\nI  would  have  preferred to do it the  intelligent\r\n\r\nway:  when one goes over a road which one knows  is\r\n\r\nmined,  one sends an armoured car first to blow  up\r\n\r\nthe  mines. Watch for them, know where the path  is\r\n\r\nsafe,   then   follow.  But  not  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill.  He  just went in on the  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nStaff  Association. Does he know what this  is  all\r\n\r\nabout?  Has  he got any contacts with  the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard? He says it i5 the N.T.U.C. versus S.A.T.U. I\r\n\r\ndo not think it is. It is the Communists versus the\r\n\r\nRest  and  I am in favour of the Rest. Mr Rajendra\r\n\r\nis  not  my  friend. I did what was right  for  the\r\n\r\nnurses, although at that time my friend, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Kampong Kapor, was extremely upset. Because  my\r\n\r\njob  was  to get the Rest. It is like one of  those\r\n\r\nTest  matches, Mr Speaker, Sir. You know the other\r\n\r\nfellows   have  11  good  men  and  I   think   the\r\n\r\nintelligent thing is to get as many of the good men\r\n\r\non your side as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Harbour Board is not under my control. I put\r\n\r\nJamit   Singh   there.  He  was   blackmailed   and\r\n\r\nbludgeoned into going the Communist way. He had  to\r\n\r\ntake  the  consequences. He went wrong. That  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  for the law. But he was playing a political\r\n\r\ngame.  He got sentenced, sent to prison. He put  in\r\n\r\nBani  and  Lim Shee Peng. Lim Shee Peng is  now  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur. I arrested Jamit Singh. Want  to  be\r\n\r\nunkind?  His  boss the Tunku is keeping  Mr  Jamit\r\n\r\nSingh  and  Mr Lim Shee Peng. I could have  fought\r\n\r\nthem  out right up to the 31st of August. We  haste\r\n\r\nalso calculated that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Mr Speaker. Sir, my colleagues are like\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance. We all play  chess  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  books on it - the possible  permutations\r\n\r\nand  combinations which - are feasible in any  given\r\n\r\nsituation. You make one move, the enemy makes three\r\n\r\nor  four possible counter moves. You calculate what\r\n\r\nis the possible counter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   his   counter.  A  good  chess  player,   like\r\n\r\nBotvinnik, I think, calculates 10 moves ahead.  But\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill, only takes one leap into\r\n\r\nthe  abyss, not knowing where it is going  to  lead\r\n\r\nhim - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. He talks of the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nversus S.A.T.U. At least we put up a fight with the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. What has he got? Where is his trade union?\r\n\r\nWhere  is his trade union leader, Mr Lee Yew Seng?\r\n\r\nIn  St.  John's  Island as a  criminal  law  secret\r\n\r\nsociety  detainee. He has been there for  the  last\r\n\r\nfour years and will be there until he repents. That\r\n\r\nis his trade union leader. He wrote him a plaintive\r\n\r\nletter  the other day. We passed it on.  No  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  we should not. Probably he thought, after  the\r\n\r\n31st  of August, Mr Lee Yew Seng would be released\r\n\r\nand  the old gang would re-form and then they would\r\n\r\nrun  around  the town again. No, we have calculated\r\n\r\nthat to the nth degree. Make no bones about it.  So\r\n\r\nwe say he gets no advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said all this tickled him. Does he really, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir? Very funny man if he does. To go down\r\n\r\nto  a  meeting of 10,000 workers with whom  he  had\r\n\r\nlost  contact for three to four years. I knew  them\r\n\r\nfor  years.  And on that confidence  that  my  long\r\n\r\nassociation  with them would give me  a  chance  of\r\n\r\ngetting  a fair hearing, I got them there  and  got\r\n\r\nthe  union leaders there and put the cards  on  the\r\n\r\ntable.  I  was  not going to have a  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nstrike,  definitely not one led by  the  Communists\r\n\r\nand certainly not before the 31st of August. And if\r\n\r\nthey called one, it would be illegal. The union  is\r\n\r\nunder  a  state of suspension; order to show  cause\r\n\r\nfor  stealing  union funds; Court  sentenced  Jamit\r\n\r\nSingh  to one and a half years for pinching $8,000;\r\n\r\ncommittee improperly elected; challenge in the High\r\n\r\nCourt.  I  thought it was right and  proper,  in  a\r\n\r\nfriendly way, to put my cards down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me tell the Member for Cairnhill - he will\r\n\r\nnever learn and it is too late even if he tries  it\r\n\r\nnow  because  he has not got that kind of  thinking\r\n\r\napparatus. Never fight the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsolate  the  Communist leaders,  settle  with  the\r\n\r\nworkers, then break the Communist leaders.  I  make\r\n\r\nno  bones about this. They know that I am going  to\r\n\r\nbreak  them  and they are going to break  me.  They\r\n\r\nwere  not worried about him. They would rather have\r\n\r\nhim  here.  Life would be easier for them.  Because\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill just would disappear.  He\r\n\r\nwould  not turn up. I went there, put my  cards  on\r\n\r\nthe table. There was no brow-beating; there was  no\r\n\r\nnothing.  There  was just the plain straightforward\r\n\r\nputting of the cards on the table: appeal to  their\r\n\r\nlogic,  their  reason  and good  sense.  I  gave  a\r\n\r\nMalaysia  bonus.  Why not? $2 million  which  Jamit\r\n\r\nSingh, had he not played the Communist game,  would\r\n\r\nhave  got  them nearly two years ago. The Anson  by\r\n\r\nelection  - he started his first claim. We  made  an\r\n\r\noffer.  My  colleague, the Minister for  Education,\r\n\r\nwas Chairman of the Harbour Board then. I gave them\r\n\r\nno  more than their just due, and I thought it  was\r\n\r\nright.  I also made sure that there was no sparking\r\n\r\npoint for any trouble, because if the Harbour Board\r\n\r\ngoes on strike and riots start, then the troops are\r\n\r\nout.  I  do not want the troops to be out. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  deal just with the leaders, not with  the\r\n\r\nmen. Never get the rank and file inflamed. I am not\r\n\r\ninterested  in  arresting or  beating  up  pregnant\r\n\r\nwomen  who  come  to  my office  with  bottles  and\r\n\r\nsticks,  or old- mothers and fathers. But I  think,\r\n\r\nquite rightly, the State Advocate-General took  the\r\n\r\nright  and proper view, and the gentleman  who  led\r\n\r\nthem will have to explain why they were present and\r\n\r\nfor  what purpose. And so the fight will always  go\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last time I had a ringside view and I learned it\r\n\r\nat  the  expense of the Member for  Anson  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill I saw  them  bludgeoned  and\r\n\r\ncudgelled  almost  into  stupor.  The  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill's tactics? He said it tickled him.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know whether he is the sort of chap whose wife\r\n\r\nwill get a divorce for cruelty because he wants  to\r\n\r\nbe  tickled. But I will tell him this. It  did  not\r\n\r\ntickle me when I read that Lim Ching Siong, in  the\r\n\r\ndays  when  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  was  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, in the room where the Clerk now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsits,  presented  him with black banners.  And  his\r\n\r\ncounter  to that was to run around town in his  car\r\n\r\nwith  the  black banner, go to Merdeka  Bridge  and\r\n\r\nfire crackers -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> To drive away the evil spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. I wept, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause   I   knew  it  was  an  unequal   contest.\r\n\r\nCalculators  with  brawn and brains  on  one  side:\r\n\r\ngamblers  on  the other side hoping for  the  lucky\r\n\r\npunch.  I  am not hoping for any lucky  punch.  You\r\n\r\nblock  the  15  seats;  that was  also  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount.  Certain other alternative plans  are  put\r\n\r\ninto  operation. This motion is blocked.  He  faces\r\n\r\nelections  before  31st August. Can  he?  The  boss\r\n\r\ndecides. And I say this to him quite frankly. If it\r\n\r\nshould so be, if they really want to test strength,\r\n\r\nI say. \"Right, let us have it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Members on the other side, the Barisan, the\r\n\r\nstupidity  of  it all. Here we were giving  them  a\r\n\r\nchance,  a run for their money's worth; last  race,\r\n\r\nput  your money on an outsider, maybe it would come\r\n\r\nin.  Supposing  they won 10 or eight  or  seven  or\r\n\r\nfive.  There  you are, it proves that some  of  the\r\n\r\nmasses are on their side. No, they did not want it.\r\n\r\nThey  wanted  it after merger. I think  it  is  the\r\n\r\ngravest miscalculation they have ever made. I  have\r\n\r\nmade  the  offer; it has been rejected; so  be  it.\r\n\r\nNow,  we  proceed.  He kept on saying,  \"During  my\r\n\r\ntime.\"  Yes,  three and a half years of ineptitude,\r\n\r\nsometimes  sheer blunt stupidity. They waited  till\r\n\r\nthe fire started; it got out of hand, and he called\r\n\r\nthe  Fire Brigade. It was not enough. The Army fire\r\n\r\nbrigade  had to come in. I do not believe in  doing\r\n\r\nthat. I think the art of government in Singapore is\r\n\r\nto  make quite sure that force need never be  used.\r\n\r\nThe   Chinese   Communists,  being   Chinese,   are\r\n\r\ncalculative. I say this without any offence  to  my\r\n\r\nMalay friends on both sides of the House. They  run\r\n\r\namok.  They do not care whether they win  or  lose.\r\n\r\nThey  just  run  amok. When a Malay runs  amok,  he\r\n\r\ntakes  a knife and runs amok. You kill him  or  you\r\n\r\ncapture  him or he kills a lot of people. But  with\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese Communists, however brave, however big\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalk  of  revolution, there is always  that  moment\r\n\r\nbefore the final decision is made when he stops and\r\n\r\nlooks  at the opposing forces. If he sees  a  small\r\n\r\nthing  which he thinks he can take on and bash  and\r\n\r\nbeat  up,  then  I think it mounts, and  then  real\r\n\r\ntrouble  starts.  Then you  have  to  call  in  the\r\n\r\nreserves, British troops and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to make my intentions and the\r\n\r\nintentions of my Government really clear  and  very\r\n\r\nsimple. It always saves a lot of trouble. It is  my\r\n\r\nway,  of governing. My colleagues all do the  same.\r\n\r\nAnd  so  it was with the Work Brigade. The  Barisan\r\n\r\nboys  were  going to start something.  One  morning\r\n\r\nthey  woke  up  at dawn and at all  the  camps,  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Minister for Home Affairs,  had  the\r\n\r\nGurkhas drilling in the centre of the compound. Not\r\n\r\none  word was said. Mr Speaker, Sir. Not one  word\r\n\r\nneed  be  said. All they did was, at 5  a.m.,  they\r\n\r\nmarched  into  the quadrangle of  the  camps  where\r\n\r\ntrouble was expected and drilled for one and a half\r\n\r\nhours.  They  marched  forward,  gave  orders,  had\r\n\r\nbayonet practice - put it up and down, I do not know\r\n\r\nwhat  they  call  it:  you  know,  the  bolt,   the\r\n\r\ncartridges  and  so on, and all the  trouble-makers\r\n\r\nwent home. Not a shot was fired. And forgive me  if\r\n\r\nI  believe  that that is the better  way  of  doing\r\n\r\nthings.  Then they tried to march around town.  The\r\n\r\nReserve Unit came out, met them in sufficient force\r\n\r\nto  leave  nobody in any doubts as to who would  be\r\n\r\nthe  victor,  who  would be  the  vanquished  in  a\r\n\r\ncollision. They also went home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member said the strike would be called off\r\n\r\nwithin  two days. What did I mean? I will tell  him\r\n\r\nwhat  I  would  have done. It is not past  history.\r\n\r\nThere will never be a strike before 31st of August.\r\n\r\nBani has been isolated. The Committee with him  and\r\n\r\nthe   150  chaps,  the  hard  core  with  him,  are\r\n\r\nisolated. Two of them have already got the sack for\r\n\r\nindiscipline during working hours, and any  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  others  up  for similar indiscipline  will  be\r\n\r\nsacked.  My  orders.  I am in charge.  I  tell  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board this is the way. Security ultimately\r\n\r\nis my responsibility. I make no apologies for it. A\r\n\r\nman  was found missing from duty for one and a half\r\n\r\nhours. He is a Communist, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  know\r\n\r\nhim. He had been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing  around fixing up for the evening  whilst  he\r\n\r\nwas  supposed to be inspecting the loading  at  the\r\n\r\nhatch.  He  was asked where he had been.  He  said,\r\n\r\n\"None of your business. You can tell the Chairman,\"\r\n\r\nwhich  they did. The Chairman consulted me,  and  I\r\n\r\nsaid,   \"Proceed  with  the  ordinary  disciplinary\r\n\r\nprocedure. What do the Harbour Board do under  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances?\"  They said,  \"Sack  him.\"  I  said,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  so be it.\" So the Committee were  going  to\r\n\r\ncall a strike. But that was a bad issue, because as\r\n\r\none  man, nobody got the benefit. So they  said  it\r\n\r\nwas  pay  claims. Another chap got the  sack  under\r\n\r\nsimilar circumstances. Markandu is not a Communist.\r\n\r\nI  gave  him five chances, Mr Speaker,  Sir  three\r\n\r\ntimes in my office, two times in the Harbour Board.\r\n\r\nI know him. The trouble with him is that he needs a\r\n\r\nlot  of time at some of the places of entertainment\r\n\r\naround  Tanjong  Pagar  to  be  sober,  and  he  is\r\n\r\ncompletely in their grip. He sees me; he agrees. He\r\n\r\ngoes  hack;  Mr Bani writes a long  statement;  he\r\n\r\nsigns. He cannot write that statement, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I  know  his  English and I know  Mr  Bani's\r\n\r\nEnglish and I have proof that Mr Bani is -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister should\r\n\r\nrefer to Mr Bani as the Member for Thomson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, the Member for Thomson. He\r\n\r\nwas  the  leading light. I called him to my  office\r\n\r\nthree  times.  The  first time. I said,  \"Markandu,\r\n\r\nplease  do not make me do this. Here is a  way  out\r\n\r\nfor you, and an honourable way out. So dissolve the\r\n\r\ntwo  committees.  Get rid of the  Communists.  Bani\r\n\r\nout.  Settle  your  union problem.\"  He  said  yes.\r\n\r\n\"Elect section by section, start negotiations.:\" He\r\n\r\nsaid  yes.  That evening there was a long statement\r\n\r\ndenouncing  me - that I prevented the right  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  to  make representations. Members  of  the\r\n\r\nPress  were there. Why was there no adverse  public\r\n\r\nreaction? Because the public knew the truth.  There\r\n\r\nwas  a  long, deliberate, elaborate process of  the\r\n\r\nclarification of stands before the strike.  I  gave\r\n\r\nMarkandu a chance. The second time he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncame,  I  said, \"In that case, now since  you  have\r\n\r\ngone in, you have got to retire. No. He went on and\r\n\r\nsigned  more  long  statements.  After  the   third\r\n\r\nbottle,  they always think the revolution has  been\r\n\r\nwon.  Just like some members of the Alliance Party,\r\n\r\nthey  always  sit down at the table. I always  find\r\n\r\nthat  my troubles begin after they have had a  good\r\n\r\ndinner, because at the eighth course and after  the\r\n\r\ntenth  whisky  has gone down, in their  minds  they\r\n\r\nhave  won the next elections and thinking how  they\r\n\r\nare  going  to  share the spoils. [Interruption]  I\r\n\r\ndrink beer, Mr Speaker, Sir. I make no bones about\r\n\r\nit.   But  I  like  to  do  my  calculations   very\r\n\r\nmethodically  early in the morning with  a  cup  of\r\n\r\ntea. I never make a decision at night. That is  so.\r\n\r\nAnd so. Markandu twice in the Harbour Board, in the\r\n\r\nBoard  room  in  the  presence of  all  his  fellow\r\n\r\ncommittee men and in the presence of the workers, I\r\n\r\noffered  him a way out. I told him the  first  time\r\n\r\nthat if he went down and signed any more statements\r\n\r\nfrom  Bani, then it was an act of war. He was going\r\n\r\nwith  Bani. The Member for Thomson is lighting  me,\r\n\r\nwilly-nilly.  He knows he has done it.  He  is  not\r\n\r\nsuch a fool. He has got exactly 32 days left. If he\r\n\r\nwants to make it shorter, that is his business. But\r\n\r\nhe has got 32 days left when I am in charge. And we\r\n\r\nplay it the open way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They blew me with loudspeakers froth the roof-top.\r\n\r\nI  hailed back and turned the loudspeakers on them.\r\n\r\nWe  started the argument. They said I am a Fascist.\r\n\r\nYou  know.  Mr Speaker. Sir, it is a  very  simple\r\n\r\npoint. I told the crowd, all I had to do, if I  was\r\n\r\na  Fascist, was to tell the police officer who  was\r\n\r\nthere  to  ring up Rumah Miskin Police Station  and\r\n\r\nthe 70 gentlemen upstairs had no way of escape, and\r\n\r\nthey  would  all  be  in for a breach  of  the  law\r\n\r\n- disturbing the peace, conduct likely  to  cause  a\r\n\r\nbreach  of the peace. I know enough of the  law  to\r\n\r\nknow  what section all these things fall under.  It\r\n\r\nis  very simple. I thought it was best in the  long\r\n\r\nrun  to  let them have their go. Black banners.  So\r\n\r\nlong as they did not take a stone, a stick, an acid\r\n\r\nbomb,  a gun. If they did, then force versus force.\r\n\r\nI  mean, argument goes out of the window and  force\r\n\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Member for Cairnhill prepared to do that?\r\n\r\nHe  will  never contemplate that. Again  these  are\r\n\r\npersonal problems which I do not wish to touch  on.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would say that people who spend their  time\r\n\r\nplaying mahjong and poker at high salaries are  not\r\n\r\nlikely   to  go  around  calculating  these  things\r\n\r\nmethodically. And you have to when you are fighting\r\n\r\nan enemy who is methodical, thorough and absolutely\r\n\r\ndetermined.  In  this case, they were  wrong.  They\r\n\r\nfought the nation. They fought national unity. They\r\n\r\ntold  lies  on  citizenship.  They  told  lies   on\r\n\r\neducation.  Right at this moment,  they  are  going\r\n\r\naround -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I ask the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nto try now to devote his time to the port workers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, we must always realise\r\n\r\nwhat we are doing. On whose side are we on? That is\r\n\r\nmy  theme, Mr Speaker, Sir,I am asking the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill, on whose side is he on? And  I  say\r\n\r\nthe answer is, he is on his side, and whether as  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  or anybody else, if he believes  he  can\r\n\r\nget  something out of it, he proceeds. That  is  my\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  his  conduct.  They  are   going\r\n\r\naround.  They  have not given up  the  fight.  They\r\n\r\nthought  that there were going to be elections  for 15  Members  and now, by their own stupidity,  they\r\n\r\nhave  thrown  it away. They were preparing  for  it\r\n\r\nwhilst  I  was away in London. The moment the  Bill\r\n\r\nwas  tabled, they prepared for it. They went  round\r\n\r\nthe  rural constituencies from Sembawang  to  Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu  to spread the lie that Chinese education  and\r\n\r\nculture  would  be destroyed after merger.  I  know\r\n\r\nthat.  I  will go back there and again explain  and\r\n\r\nagain unscramble. So it goes on all the time, every\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Mr Markandu again, on him I end. The Member\r\n\r\nfor   Cairnhill  says,  \"Oh, what  a  wicked  chap\r\n\r\npunishing a man.\" I gave Mr Markandu five chances.\r\n\r\nThe  last  one was at a public meeting in front  of\r\n\r\n10,000  workers. I stated the facts which he  could\r\n\r\nnot  deny.  But  he  signed Mr  Bani's  statements\r\n\r\nevery  time.  He  said  \"Oh,  well,  Bani  is   my\r\n\r\nadviser.\" So I said, \"Well, stop it now or you must\r\n\r\nshare Bani's fate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat  evening he went out and drank more booze  and\r\n\r\nmade  more  statements. His  citizenship  is  being\r\n\r\nrevoked and I made no apologies for it. I think  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary in the national interest that  people\r\n\r\nshould  understand, that even  if  you  are  not  a\r\n\r\nCommunist but you play the Communist line, then you\r\n\r\nwear  the  Communist jersey and go down with  them.\r\n\r\nYou  must  be  prepared. You cannot  say,  \"if  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  win,  I  share in the  spoils.  If  the\r\n\r\nCommunists lose, please do not hurt me as I am  not\r\n\r\na  Communist.\" The fight is on. It is a  matter  of\r\n\r\nlife  and  death, and I am determined not  to  lose\r\n\r\nthis  fight. There is no stir in the Harbour Board.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for  Cairnhill has no  chance  at  the\r\n\r\nwaterfront. All his gangster boys, Lee  Yew  Seng's\r\n\r\ngangster  boys - I beg his pardon - are all gone  and\r\n\r\nthey have dispersed. Let me remind him that on  his\r\n\r\nown  Special  Branch advice - I do not say  that  he\r\n\r\nhimself did it - he arrested the Member for Kallang,\r\n\r\nChe  Buang,  in 1956, knowing that the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKallang  was  not  a Communist. He  arrested  Inche\r\n\r\nAwang, President of the S.T.C.E.U., knowing that he\r\n\r\nwas  not  a  Communist, but because he was  running\r\n\r\naround  with the Communists. So he went  down.  The\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch recommended and he acted. When  they\r\n\r\nwere  confident  that Inche Awang and  Inche  Buang\r\n\r\nwere not really Communists or going to support  the\r\n\r\nCommunist cause, they were released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Mr Markandu is in exactly that same\r\n\r\ncategory.  The only difference between  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  and us is this. His Special  Branch\r\n\r\ndid  all  his thinking for him. Our Special  Branch\r\n\r\ndoes part of our thinking for us because we have to\r\n\r\nmake  the  political decision. If I listen  to  the\r\n\r\nSpecial   Branch,  Mr  Speaker.  Sir,  then   this\r\n\r\nAssembly today will be a slightly different  place.\r\n\r\nThere will be a few vacant chairs in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nI  make no bones about it. They know it and I  know\r\n\r\nit.  It is a political decision which I had to make\r\n\r\nand I said. \"No. Let it be 25-25 to the end and the\r\n\r\nend is the 31st of August.\" If he likes to make  it\r\n\r\nearlier,  it  is in his hands. So I say,  far  from\r\n\r\nmaking   an   apology  for  the  policies   of   my\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I leave the Member for Cairnhill  with\r\n\r\nthis passing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthought.  He  will  never come back  to  power  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. He has not a chance. Even if the  Grand\r\n\r\nAlliance win, he is fairly low down the ladder. He\r\n\r\nis  not  even  an  office-bearer  now.  He  is  an\r\n\r\nembarrassment to them. There are other bigger  men\r\n\r\nwhom  they think have cleaner records. He is  out.\r\n\r\nSo  please  do  not  try to  make  mischief  here,\r\n\r\nbecause  let me tell him this. If between now  and\r\n\r\nthe 31st of August, any mischief is created either\r\n\r\nby  his  running around with Mr Markandu who  saw\r\n\r\nhim and I know that -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> When?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my\r\n\r\njob to be informed. I do not always keep everybody\r\n\r\ninformed because it is not in the public interest.\r\n\r\nBut  I  think  in this case it is  in  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest  for  people to know  that  Mr  Markandu\r\n\r\nthinks  it is unwise to get the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nto  raise his case: it is better to get the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  to  raise ii. Originally,  it  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  a much fiercer thing  than  just  a\r\n\r\nmotion on the adjournment, had prepared for it.  I\r\n\r\nknew it before I went to the Harbour Board for the\r\n\r\nfirst time. I say to him and his colleagues, there\r\n\r\nis  a place in Malaysia for them. Kuala Lumpur has\r\n\r\nmany  places  in the Senate. There are  ways  out.\r\n\r\nThere are profitable ventures. But any involvement\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's paramount interest in his personal\r\n\r\nmachinations. I say please do not. It is bound  to\r\n\r\nhave very unfortunate circumstances and I will not\r\n\r\nbaulk  even if the Member for Cairnhill,  in  his\r\n\r\nfolly,  for his own selfish interest, plays around\r\n\r\nonce  again with the communists, as he  did  -  15\r\n\r\nseats and Mr Markandu. That is my job. As I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  we have contemplated the ultimate  and  the\r\n\r\nultimate is a very unpleasant death. That has  not\r\n\r\ndeterred us and nothing will - no Khaw Kai Bohs, no\r\n\r\nother big bosses and other big friends of his.  We\r\n\r\nwill  do  what  is  right in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore and in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No, we still have time up to\r\n\r\n8.30 to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is no reply.

In the last few months,\r\n\r\nespecially   the  last  few  days,   events   have\r\n\r\ndeveloped to such an extent that he is now feeling\r\n\r\nuncomfortable.  According to his  own  words,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  game  has changed during  the  last  few\r\n\r\ndays. They cannot carry out their original plan of\r\n\r\nstriking  at  Singapore's Left-wing movement.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has just pointed out in his speech\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. will not follow the actions of the\r\n\r\nprevious Government when striking at the Left-wing\r\n\r\nmovement  hut  that  they  will  adopt  their  own\r\n\r\npolicy. The Singapore Harbour Board employees were\r\n\r\nsuppressed  under this policy. Their  request  was\r\n\r\nfrustrated by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Prime Minister bragged about\r\n\r\nthe  correctness of his decision on the  award  to\r\n\r\nthe  Harbour Board workers' wages demand. When the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill was the Minister for Labour,\r\n\r\nhe  adopted  the wrong policy because he  did  not\r\n\r\nlook  after  the interest of the workers  or  meet\r\n\r\ntheir reasonable demands. But today, has the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister met the reasonable demands of the Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  workers?  Mr Speaker, Sir,  these  demands\r\n\r\narose long before the split between the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis. For the last six years, the\r\n\r\nwages of the Harbour Board's workers have not been\r\n\r\nincreased  and their working conditions  have  not\r\n\r\nimproved. Therefore, the claims of the workers are\r\n\r\nnot  as  a result of the tussle between the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand  the  Barisan Sosialis. Long before we  parted\r\n\r\nwith  the  P.A.P., the union raised their  demands\r\n\r\nand negotiated with the Harbour Board -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands):</b> On a point of order, Sir.
