I have to inform the House that I\r\n\r\nreceived  a  letter from the Deputy Registrar of the  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt  stating that a Bankruptcy Order has been made  on  5th\r\n\r\nMay  2000  against  Mr Joshua Benjamin  Jeyaretnam.   I  also\r\n\r\nreceived  a  letter  dated  6th  May  2000  from  Messrs  Leo\r\n\r\nFernando, Advocates & Solicitors, acting on behalf of Mr J  B\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam, in which it was stated that they would be  filing\r\n\r\na  Notice of Appeal against the Bankruptcy Order made against\r\n\r\nMr  J B Jeyaretnam.  The letter also stated \"Mr Jeyaretnam is\r\n\r\nof  the  view that he should not be held to have vacated  his\r\n\r\nseat in Parliament until the hearing of his Appeal\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sought the advice of the Attorney-General on the\r\n\r\nmatter  and  he  has  advised that Mr  Jeyaretnam's  seat  in\r\n\r\nParliament was prima facie vacated on the day he was  made  a\r\n\r\nbankrupt.  The words of section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act  are\r\n\r\nclear in effect.  The Non-Constituency Member has now filed a\r\n\r\nNotice  of Appeal to the Judge of the High Court in  chambers\r\n\r\nwith  the  intent  to  appeal against  the  decision  of  the\r\n\r\nAssistant Registrar of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am of the opinion that it is not\r\n\r\nappropriate  for me to ask Parliament to make a determination\r\n\r\nunder  Article 48 of the Constitution as to whether his  seat\r\n\r\nhas been vacated as the Member has filed an appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DEVELOPMENT BANK OF SINGAPORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Administrative charge on POSBank accounts)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S.

We provide\r\n\r\na variety of checks for members of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Permit Department has a one-stop checking\r\n\r\nfacility  for  members of the public who wish to  verify  the\r\n\r\nauthenticity  of a work permit card.  Anyone  can  submit  an\r\n\r\noriginal  work  permit  for  checking  at  the  Work   Permit\r\n\r\nDepartment.   The  Department  receives  about   50-60   such\r\n\r\nrequests  for  authentication every week.  An acknowledgement\r\n\r\nletter  will  be  issued  to the member  of  the  public  who\r\n\r\npresents  a  work permit card for checking.  Members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic can also verify the authenticity of a work permit card\r\n\r\nby  using one of the self-service information kiosks  at  the\r\n\r\nDepartment.  Currently, the information kiosk is not equipped\r\n\r\nto  provide a written confirmation.  We are in the process of\r\n\r\nimproving the service to provide a hard copy confirmation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Department is also able to verify the\r\n\r\nidentity  of  a  work  permit  holder  if  the  foreigner  is\r\n\r\npersonally  present for a finger-print check.  We  can  match\r\n\r\nhis  finger-print with records captured when the work  permit\r\n\r\nwas  issued.   In  the case of employment pass  holders,  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Pass  Department will verify the authenticity  of\r\n\r\nthe pass when requested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who do not wish to come personally to the Work\r\n\r\nPermit Department or the Employment Pass Department, they can\r\n\r\nalso  verify the information given on a work pass by  calling\r\n\r\nthe Ministry's One-Call Centre.  The one-call centre has been\r\n\r\nreceiving  as many as 100 calls a day for this  purpose.   We\r\n\r\nalso  provide  an   interactive voice response  system  where\r\n\r\nanyone can dial in to verify the information given on a  work\r\n\r\npass.   An  advisory  on  how to use  the  interactive  voice\r\n\r\nresponse  system  has  been freely distributed  at  the  Work\r\n\r\nPermit Department's service counters since March this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Permit Department and the Singapore Immigration\r\n\r\nand  Registration are also currently working towards allowing\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public to verify the work permit  status  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers or the long term visit passes of  foreigners\r\n\r\nthrough the Internet.  This facility will be available within\r\n\r\n3 to 6 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While members of the public can make use of the various\r\n\r\nfacilities provided by my Ministry to verify the work  permit\r\n\r\nstatus  of  foreign  workers, I must  stress  that  landlords\r\n\r\nshould  also check both the work pass and passport or  travel\r\n\r\ndocument  to ascertain that the particulars on both documents\r\n\r\ncorrespond  materially.   Where the employer  is  named,  the\r\n\r\nlandlord  should also check with the employer to verify  that\r\n\r\nthe  prospective  tenants  are in fact  employed  as  stated.\r\n\r\nWhere  a  foreigner has no work pass records, landlords  must\r\n\r\ncheck  the  foreigner's passport or travel document  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that the latter has legal stay in Singapore and is  not\r\n\r\nan illegal immigrant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I have two\r\n\r\nquestions.

Does the prospective landlord\r\n\r\nhave  to submit the original copy of the document to the Work\r\n\r\nPermit  Department?  The second question is  on  the  finger-printing check.  I think that is the best foolproof check  to\r\n\r\nverify  whether a person is truly a legal immigrant or  legal\r\n\r\nworker.   Could  this finger-printing check be designated  to\r\n\r\nall  neighbourhood police posts, for ease of  access  to  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if any landlord\r\n\r\nwants  to check on the authenticity of the actual work permit\r\n\r\nor  the  employment  pass,  then,  of  course,  the  original\r\n\r\ndocument  has to be submitted, because you cannot verify  the\r\n\r\nauthenticity on the basis of a photocopy.

The funding needs of such expenditure\r\n\r\nare  met  either through loans from Government, through  bank\r\n\r\nborrowings or through the issue of bonds in the open  market.\r\n\r\nIf  they  are borrowed from Government, the loans will  carry\r\n\r\nassessed interest not significantly different from bond rates\r\n\r\nfor  similar  maturities.  Bank borrowings often  cost  more,\r\n\r\nespecially  for  loans  of longer maturities.   Overall,  the\r\n\r\ndiversification  of  their borrowing  portfolios  should  not\r\n\r\nraise their cost of capital, if properly structured.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, statutory boards have tended to rely mostly\r\n\r\non  Government loans or bank borrowings as the procedures are\r\n\r\nless  complicated.   Nowadays, they are encouraged  to  issue\r\n\r\nbonds  to fund their programmes so that their costs of  funds\r\n\r\nare   properly   priced.   Such  bond  issues  also   provide\r\n\r\nadditional outlets for the investment of domestic savings and\r\n\r\ncontribute towards the development of our capital market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the specific case of the link between HDB's borrowing\r\n\r\ncosts  and  its mortgage rates, I should point out  that  the\r\n\r\nissue of bonds by HDB has no impact on the interest rates for\r\n\r\nthe  concessionary mortgage loans, which are pegged  at  0.1%\r\n\r\nabove  the  CPF  Ordinary Account interest rate.   The  bonds\r\n\r\nissued  under the HDB Medium Term Note Programme are not  for\r\n\r\nfinancing subsidised mortgage loans, but for financing  HDB's\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programmes  and  operational  requirements.  The\r\n\r\nbonds replace some of the HDB's loans provided to HDB by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment at an interest rate of 2% above the CPF rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no plans at present to change the current peg\r\n\r\nbetween  the CPF Ordinary Account interest rate and  the  HDB\r\n\r\nconcessionary  mortgage rate.  The source of  funds  for  the\r\n\r\nmortgage loans will continue to be from the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to confirm that the cost of raising capital via\r\n\r\nbonds  for statutory boards is actually lower than that  from\r\n\r\ndirect borrowings from the banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> So far, that has been the case.\r\n\r\nI  will  give  an example.

The\r\n\r\nmedical   examination  includes  a  section  on  the  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  worker's mental history.  If the  examining  doctor\r\n\r\nfeels  that  the  foreign  domestic worker  is  not  mentally\r\n\r\nstable,  the foreign domestic worker will not be cleared  for\r\n\r\nemployment.   The Work Permit Department does, from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime,  reject applications from foreign domestic workers  who\r\n\r\nhave a history of mental illness, although the number of such\r\n\r\ncases  is  not large.  The vast majority of foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers are normal healthy persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence requiring a psychological evaluation may not be\r\n\r\neffective in preventing tragedies involving foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers.   Typically, foreign domestic workers,  who  exhibit\r\n\r\nabnormal  behaviour,  do  so as  a  result  of  work  related\r\n\r\nstresses  or  news  of  unpleasant  events  from  home.   The\r\n\r\nreported cases of foreign domestic workers, who were suicidal\r\n\r\nor   who  inflicted  harm  on  a  member  of  the  employer's\r\n\r\nhousehold,  were normal when they first arrived in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is  doubtful whether psychological evaluation would  have\r\n\r\nprevented these tragedies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign domestic workers work and stay with their\r\n\r\nemployers.  Hence, employers are responsible for helping  the\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic  workers to cope and  adapt  to  their  new\r\n\r\nworking and living environment.  Some foreign domestic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers  may need more time to adjust to the new  social  and\r\n\r\ncultural environment than others.  Employers should therefore\r\n\r\nbe  more  sensitive to foreign domestic workers' adaptability\r\n\r\nand not subject them to unnecessary work pressures especially\r\n\r\nat the beginning of their employment in Singapore.  Employers\r\n\r\nshould  also  show  more understanding and  concern  if  they\r\n\r\ndetect  that  their foreign domestic workers are  emotionally\r\n\r\nupset,   especially  after  receiving  letters   from   home.\r\n\r\nGenerally,   employers  who  treat  their  foreign   domestic\r\n\r\nworkers well and are genuinely concerned with the welfare and\r\n\r\ninterest of their foreign domestic workers are more likely to\r\n\r\nenjoy  a  happy and productive relationship with the  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Minister see the need\r\n\r\nto  require foreign domestic workers after they have  arrived\r\n\r\nhere  to  also  include a psychological evaluation  in  their\r\n\r\nsubsequent medical examination?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not feel the\r\n\r\nneed for it because, as I said, if the employer observes that\r\n\r\nthe  foreign  domestic worker is psychologically unstable  or\r\n\r\nnot  adjusting well, they would know what to do, ie,  make  a\r\n\r\nproper arrangement either to repatriate the person who is not\r\n\r\nwell  or  who  is  obviously unfit to work and  live  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore environment.

There is a  possibility  that  the\r\n\r\nhormone  could not be detected when she is in  a  very  early\r\n\r\nstage  of pregnancy.

I was also advised that\r\n\r\nit  can  be  detected  through blood test  and,  for  medical\r\n\r\nexamination  of  foreign  domestic maids,  a  blood  test  is\r\n\r\nalready  necessary to identify diseases like HIV and sexually\r\n\r\ntransmitted  diseases.  So it is possible to incorporate  the\r\n\r\nblood  test for pregnancy. We understand, however,  that  the\r\n\r\ncost  may be slightly higher. The cost per urine test, I  was\r\n\r\ntold,  is about $1. The cost per blood test for pregnancy  is\r\n\r\nabout  $3.35.  We  will  look at  it  and  put  up  a  formal\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  later.    By\r\n\r\ninsisting on a blood test, the possibility of adulteration is\r\n\r\nmuch less because the doctor would probably have to draw  the\r\n\r\nblood  himself  rather than leaving the maid to  produce  the\r\n\r\nurine  and  she could have carried that bottle of urine  with\r\n\r\nher to the toilet before the test.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary: in\r\n\r\na  case  of  deceit by the maid, is the doctor  still  to  be\r\n\r\nblamed or is the maid solely liable?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I am quite sure that this would have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  into  consideration during the  inquiry  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Medical Council.

Let me clarify that temporary, casual and  contract\r\n\r\nworkers are covered by the CPF Act, Employment Act, Factories\r\n\r\nAct  and  Workmen's Compensation Act - as long  as  they  are\r\n\r\nemployees engaged under a contract of service.  For  example,\r\n\r\na  worker who is employed by a shipyard on a temporary  basis\r\n\r\nwill be entitled to CPF\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontribution  and  also  enjoy  all  the  statutory  benefits\r\n\r\nstipulated  in the Employment Act.

If\r\n\r\nhe  meets  with  an accident in the course of his  work,  his\r\n\r\nemployer is liable to pay compensation in accordance with the\r\n\r\nWorkmen's  Compensation Act.

These\r\n\r\nemployers  include employment agencies and  labour  suppliers\r\n\r\nwho  engage contract or temporary workers and supply them  to\r\n\r\ncompanies  that  need  such workers.  They  are  required  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  the  provisions of these  laws,  including  the\r\n\r\ncontributions to be made under the CPF Act and the  statutory\r\n\r\nbenefits stipulated in the Employment Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry carries out regular inspections to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  companies  comply with the laws under our  purview.

We have no intention to change the current limit for\r\n\r\nthe time being.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Compassvale incident, BCA has reviewed its\r\n\r\ncurrent  system in which the work of a professional  engineer\r\n\r\nis  checked  by an AC to ensure the safety of the  structure.\r\n\r\nThe  system  is found to be sufficiently stringent.  However,\r\n\r\nBCA  will  be  fine-tuning the AC system to ensure  that  ACs\r\n\r\nmaintain  a  high standard in checking so that there  are  no\r\n\r\nlapses in the design. Some of the measures include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) ensuring that the larger or more complicated\r\n\r\nprojects  will  be undertaken by an AC practice  with  better\r\n\r\nresources and staff strength;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) requiring ACs to apply for renewal of registration\r\n\r\nannually; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) stepping up surveillance and enforcement actions to\r\n\r\nmaintain a high standard in AC practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry intends to amend the Building Control Act\r\n\r\nthis  year  to  strengthen the AC system.

On 20th April, the Chairman of the Public\r\n\r\nTransport  Council announced the new fares  that  would  take\r\n\r\neffect from 1st June.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reviewing fare proposals, the Public Transport\r\n\r\nCouncil  has  to  take  into  consideration  improvements  in\r\n\r\nservice  quality, rising costs and the need to balance  these\r\n\r\nagainst  consumer  affordability and the long-term  financial\r\n\r\nviability  of  the  transport operators.  In  approving  this\r\n\r\nround  of fare increases, the Council has explained that  its\r\n\r\napproval  was based on these considerations that I have  just\r\n\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council has also explained that the increase in\r\n\r\nfeeder  fares is intended to ameliorate in some  measure  the\r\n\r\npricing  anomaly  of feeder fares compared to  minimum  trunk\r\n\r\nfares.  At present, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfeeder fares are much lower than the trunk fares, even though\r\n\r\nthey  consume the same level of resources.  This  results  in\r\n\r\ncommuters often pressing for feeder services even though they\r\n\r\nhave   trunk  services  plying  the  same  route.   The  fare\r\n\r\nadjustment   will   reflect  the  cost  of  operations   more\r\n\r\naccurately,  and  incentivise operators to provide  a  better\r\n\r\nfeeder network to serve residents better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in fares for commuters travelling longer\r\n\r\ndistances  will  make the fare structure  more  equitable  by\r\n\r\nrequiring long distance commuters to bear a fairer  share  of\r\n\r\nthe  costs.   Today,  short  distance  commuters  are  cross-subsidising longer distance commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In approving the fare revision, the Public Transport\r\n\r\nCouncil has moderated the fare proposals of the operators  to\r\n\r\nkeep  the  increase  at a modest level.  The  operators  have\r\n\r\nprojected that based on what the Council approved, their fare\r\n\r\nrevenue will only increase by 2.4% or less.  This is a modest\r\n\r\nincrease,  considering   that fares have  not  been  adjusted\r\n\r\nsince 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is best that operators regularly review public\r\n\r\ntransport fares so that any fare increase is in small  steps.\r\n\r\nThis   approach  is  less  painful  than  holding  back  fare\r\n\r\nincreases  until  cost pressures become intolerable  and  the\r\n\r\npublic is then faced with a massive increase in one exercise.\r\n\r\nOperators  are aware that any fare increase is  capped  by  a\r\n\r\nformula pegged to the cost of living, ie, at CPI + x%,  where\r\n\r\nx is an adjustment factor for cost of operations such as wage\r\n\r\nchanges  and  productivity gains.  Based on this formula,  if\r\n\r\nPTC  had  allowed fares to increase up to the cap every  year\r\n\r\nfrom  1997, the fares would have increased by a total of 8.3%\r\n\r\nafter  this  year's fare revision, compared to the  level  in\r\n\r\n1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Transport Council has exercised due diligence\r\n\r\nin  carrying  out  its duty to scrutinise  the  proposals  of\r\n\r\npublic transport operators and in approving the latest  round\r\n\r\nof  increases.

May I refer him to the statement that appeared in\r\n\r\nthe press sometime ago?  May I ask the Minister of State what\r\n\r\ninquiries  had  he made before he made that public  statement\r\n\r\nsaying that the increases were just and fair?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the comment that I made\r\n\r\nregarding increases was made after the PTC's announcement  of\r\n\r\nits approval.  Of course, the Ministry had to scrutinise what\r\n\r\nthe  PTC  had  deliberated on and whether it is indeed  fair.\r\n\r\nOur view is that the PTC has done its duty and has looked  in\r\n\r\na  very detailed manner into all the factors before coming to\r\n\r\nthis conclusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, does the Minister of State remember\r\n\r\nthat  in  his statement he said that the drivers had suffered\r\n\r\npay cuts during the recession, and it was only fair that they\r\n\r\nshould  now have their salaries increased, or words  to  that\r\n\r\neffect?   May I ask the Minister of State whether  he  looked\r\n\r\ninto  the  accounts of the bus companies during the recession\r\n\r\nto  see  whether  their profits had gone down  a  substantial\r\n\r\nlevel  that  required the salaries to be cut,  if  they  were\r\n\r\nindeed cut?  Had he made those inquiries?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the PTC took into\r\n\r\nconsideration many factors.  Inflation was one  factor.   The\r\n\r\ninvestments   that   the  companies  put   in   for   service\r\n\r\nimprovements  was  another  factor.  Productivity  gains  was\r\n\r\nanother  factor.   The  possibility  of  wage  increases  was\r\n\r\nanother  factor.  All these were considered by the  PTC  when\r\n\r\nthey  deliberated on these proposals.  Therefore, as  far  as\r\n\r\nwage  increase is concerned, if they do not have an  increase\r\n\r\nin  revenue,  it would be very difficult for the  company  to\r\n\r\nconsider a wage increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I am afraid the Minister has not\r\n\r\nanswered my question.

And even if they put the\r\n\r\nassets into bonds, I am sure, without the hassle of all these\r\n\r\nbus operations, it would give them a better return.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  about the timing of the  increases?

Given  that the crisis started  in  1999  and  the\r\n\r\ncrisis  seems  to  be  over, do these increases  signal  that\r\n\r\npublic  transport as a whole is expected  to  go  up  as  the\r\n\r\neconomy goes up?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as MCIT is overseeing the\r\n\r\ntransport sector, so I speak for the transport sector.  If we\r\n\r\nlook  at  the inflation figures since 1997, although we  have\r\n\r\nbeen through the recession, there is still inflation.  And if\r\n\r\nwe  look  at  investments in buses, TIBS, for  instance,  has\r\n\r\nspent $100 million in acquiring 300 new buses and it is going\r\n\r\nto  expand its fleet by 30% this year.  SBS is going  to  buy\r\n\r\nmore superbuses and have a system using technology to improve\r\n\r\nfleet  management  and so on.  All these are  reasons  for  a\r\n\r\nrevenue  increase.  If we do not allow fare  increases,  then\r\n\r\nwhat  it means is that profitability and viability are  going\r\n\r\nto  go  down,  and there will be no incentive to improve  the\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State,\r\n\r\nfinally, is he saying then that these increases were made  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  returns for the shareholders to be satisfactory?\r\n\r\nIs that the reason?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, may I remind the Member\r\n\r\nthat Parliament passed the Public Transport Council Act,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  the  objective of the Act is to balance the interest  of\r\n\r\nboth  the  operators and the commuters.

Let  me\r\n\r\nanswer  all  these  questions  together,  by  explaining  the\r\n\r\nbackground  of  POSBank's merger with DBS bank,  the  present\r\n\r\nstatus of DBS bank, the Government's proper role, how we  can\r\n\r\nresolve  the immediate problem, and how banking services  can\r\n\r\nbe kept affordable for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>POSBank</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until 1998, when POSBank was merged with DBS Bank,\r\n\r\nPOSBank provided free banking services to all its depositors.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result,  Singaporeans with modest savings  would  open\r\n\r\naccounts  with  POSBank  rather than any  other  bank.  Small\r\n\r\naccounts  comprised a majority of POSBank  accounts:  36%  of\r\n\r\nPOSBank  savings accounts had balances less than $100,  while\r\n\r\n52%,   more   than  half,  had  balances  less   than   $500.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  because  opening a POSBank  account  was  free,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans often opened more than one account with POSBank.\r\n\r\nIn  1998, POSBank had 5.2 million savings accounts, far  more\r\n\r\nthan the number of people in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi Daipi asked whether POSBank had been losing\r\n\r\nmoney  on  its  small accounts. The answer  is  yes.  POSBank\r\n\r\nestimated  that out of the 5.2 million accounts, 3.8  million\r\n\r\n(three-quarters)  were  uneconomic, ie,  revenue  from  these\r\n\r\nsmall  accounts  was less than the costs of  servicing  them.\r\n\r\nPOSBank  did not try to recover even part of this  cost  from\r\n\r\nthe  small depositors. Instead it cross-subsidised the  small\r\n\r\ndepositors using the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlarger  accounts,  on which it could earn  profits  from  the\r\n\r\nspread  between  its deposit and lending rates.  Indeed  from\r\n\r\n1978 onwards, for 20 years, POSBank even paid higher interest\r\n\r\nrates on small deposits than on large deposits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy was not sustainable. As our financial sector\r\n\r\ndeveloped,  commercial banks and fund managers  provided  new\r\n\r\nservices  and  products that offered higher  returns  than  a\r\n\r\nPOSBank  savings  account.  As  Singaporeans  became   better\r\n\r\neducated  and financially more sophisticated, they grew  more\r\n\r\nsensitive  to  the returns their savings were  earning.  They\r\n\r\nwere  no  longer content to park their savings in  a  POSBank\r\n\r\naccount, especially if they had substantial savings. To \"make\r\n\r\ntheir money work for them\",  to use the American phrase, they\r\n\r\nbegan  to shift their savings to other banks offering  better\r\n\r\nfixed deposit rates, and into other forms of investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, in a growing market, POSBank's share of\r\n\r\nsavings  deposits  declined, from 64% in  1979  (nearly  two-thirds)  to 47% at the end of 1997, which is less than  half.\r\n\r\nIn  1997,  as  the Asian crisis intensified, commercial  bank\r\n\r\ninterest  rates rose. The gap between interest rates  offered\r\n\r\non   POSBank  savings  accounts  and  commercial  bank  fixed\r\n\r\ndeposits  widened.  Consequently, POSBank  began  losing  its\r\n\r\nbigger  depositors who accounted for most  of  its  deposits.\r\n\r\nThus, depositors with balances of $50,000 and above comprised\r\n\r\nonly  3% of the total number of POSBank account holders, but,\r\n\r\nnearly half, 48% of POSBank's total deposit base.  This group\r\n\r\nstarted  taking  the  money  out  of  POSBank  to  put   into\r\n\r\ncommercial  banks.   In  March 1998, POSBank  was  forced  to\r\n\r\nreverse   its  policy  of  paying  smaller  accounts   higher\r\n\r\ninterest, and instead started paying large accounts a  higher\r\n\r\ninterest rate than for small accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clear, therefore, that POSBank did not have a\r\n\r\npromising  future  as a stand-alone savings  bank,  providing\r\n\r\nfree  banking  services to small accounts on the  traditional\r\n\r\nmodel.  This  was  one  reason why in  1998,  the  Government\r\n\r\ndecided to merge POSBank with DBS Bank. Merger\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngave the combined bank economies of scale, and enabled it  to\r\n\r\nimprove customer services. The objective was to build a  bank\r\n\r\nlarge  enough  to  compete internationally, and  to  maintain\r\n\r\nbanking  services for Singaporeans that were affordable,  but\r\n\r\nnot necessarily free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues were fully debated when Dr Richard Hu moved\r\n\r\nthe  Second Reading of the legislation to corporatise POSBank\r\n\r\non  12th October 1998.  Among other things, Dr Hu said in his\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading  speech (Hansard, vol. 69,  col.  1027,  12th\r\n\r\nOctober 1998):\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government recognises that these market distortions\r\n\r\nhave  to  go  [he was referring to POSBank's tax  privileges,\r\n\r\nbelow  market mortgage rates, and the difficulty in gathering\r\n\r\ndeposits]. However, to ease the burden of adjustment in  this\r\n\r\nprivatisation  exercise, we are taking care  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\npainful  disruptions for POSBank's depositors  and  borrowers\r\n\r\nare   minimised.   We  therefore  set  out   a   transitional\r\n\r\narrangement to help all parties adjust over time.\"     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transitional arrangement was to phase out the tax\r\n\r\nexemption and to make the adjustments over a period of years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs spoke during the debate. Nobody opposed the\r\n\r\nBill. Dr S Vasoo supported the Bill but raised concerns  over\r\n\r\nthe service charge.  He said, and I quote him:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There are several implications that one needs to pay\r\n\r\nattention to.  One is the service charge, ie, whether service\r\n\r\ncharge to small account holders could be reviewed and whether\r\n\r\nDBS  could  be advised that the service charge would  not  be\r\n\r\nraised  unnecessarily  at the expense of  the  small  account\r\n\r\nholders.\"     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh See Kiat also supported the Bill, but he spoke\r\n\r\nabout the social objective of POSBank.  I quote him:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There is after all still a social objective that a\r\n\r\nnational  institution like the POSBank can serve, the  social\r\n\r\ninitiative of promoting thrift and saving.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock supported the Bill. He had discussed\r\n\r\nthe problem thoroughly with Dr Wang Kai Yuen, who had been  a\r\n\r\nboard  member  of  POSBank, and Dr Tan was  expressing  their\r\n\r\nshared views. Dr Tan explained clearly why the removal of the\r\n\r\nsubsidy was unavoidable. I quote him:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"From a discussion with Dr Wang, I learned that a third\r\n\r\nof  POSBank's  customers, including  children,  students  and\r\n\r\nforeign workers, have deposits of $100 or less. In fact, over\r\n\r\n90% of POSBank's deposit base is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontributed   by  only  20%  of  the  customers.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nPOSBank's accounts are being subsidised. Moreover,  the  cost\r\n\r\nof  servicing  these accounts has been escalating  all  these\r\n\r\nyears,  as  costs of ATMs, staff and premises  have  gone  up\r\n\r\nrelentlessly. POSBank could not have gone on subsidizing such\r\n\r\na  large  proportion of its depositors. The  House  might  be\r\n\r\ninterested  to  know that the Bank had been  considering  for\r\n\r\nsome  time the recovery of a portion of these costs from  its\r\n\r\ncustomers.  Some  measures  have  already  been  taken,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  GIRO  charges on service providers and  charge  for\r\n\r\ncoin  exchange.  More  were being  contemplated.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nindicated earlier, whether POSBank is merged or not, the days\r\n\r\nof free services from POSBank were numbered.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Mr Chiam See Tong who spoke during the debate only\r\n\r\nasked  for the grace period for Credit POSBank interest rates\r\n\r\nto   be  extended  from  4  to  6  years,  although  he  then\r\n\r\ninexplicably  proceeded  to vote against  the  Constitutional\r\n\r\nAmendment  to delete POSBank from the Fifth Schedule  to  the\r\n\r\nConstitution. In contrast, after hearing the debate,  Mr  Low\r\n\r\nThia Khiang supported the Constitutional Amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winding up the debate, Dr Hu gave this reassurance:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"DBS has assured us that it will continue to provide\r\n\r\nservices for the small depositors and indeed children  up  to\r\n\r\n12  years,  students  up to 21 years and  full-time  National\r\n\r\nServicemen  will all continue to be able to  have  a  POSBank\r\n\r\naccount without a service charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective, as I have explained earlier, was to build\r\n\r\non  Government's wish to develop a strong bank in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  at  the same time we wanted to ensure that the range  of\r\n\r\nPOSBank's services would be maintained as far as possible. Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  over time, some things will have to change  but,  by\r\n\r\nand  large, the best features will be maintained for as  long\r\n\r\nas feasible.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear from this debate that MPs recognised the\r\n\r\nneed  for  POSBank  to change. Some sought  reassurance  that\r\n\r\nservice  charges would not be unnecessarily raised, and  that\r\n\r\nDBS  would  not forget POSBank's social functions. Addressing\r\n\r\nthese  concerns, Dr Hu made clear that the market distortions\r\n\r\nhad  to  go, but that the Government had arranged to minimise\r\n\r\npainful  disruptions for depositors and borrowers of POSBank.\r\n\r\nHe  stated  that  children, students and  full-time  national\r\n\r\nservicemen  would  continue to have POSBank accounts  without\r\n\r\nservice charge, and that for all other small\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndepositors banking services would remain affordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>DBS</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been 19 months since the Bill was passed, and\r\n\r\nPOSBank was merged with DBS. DBS is now introducing a monthly\r\n\r\nfee  on POSBank savings accounts with less than $500 balance.\r\n\r\nMost  banks  in  Singapore already impose similar  or  higher\r\n\r\ncharges.  DBS  has explained that it will still  make  losses\r\n\r\nwith  the  $2  fee, which only partially covers the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining such a small savings account. Furthermore, it  is\r\n\r\nexempting from this fee accounts of those aged below 21 or 62\r\n\r\nand above, full-time national servicemen, as well as those on\r\n\r\npublic assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs have asked the Government to request DBS to\r\n\r\nexempt  small  savings accounts from the $2  monthly  charge.\r\n\r\nThey  include Dr S Vasoo, Dr Lily Neo, and Mr Chiam See Tong.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Government cannot do so. DBS is  a  commercial\r\n\r\ninstitution,  and  must have a free hand to  make  commercial\r\n\r\ndecisions.  DBS has a natural interest in looking  after  its\r\n\r\ncustomer  base, and in ensuring that any charges  it  imposes\r\n\r\nare  well  explained  and justified to the  public.  For  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to direct DBS as to what it should or should  not\r\n\r\ndo,  on this or any other matter of business judgment,  would\r\n\r\ndefeat  the  purpose of merging POSBank with  DBS.  It  would\r\n\r\nprevent DBS from making decisions on commercial grounds  like\r\n\r\nother  market  players,  and make it  difficult  for  DBS  to\r\n\r\ndevelop into a strong and competitive bank, in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nin  Asia.  Ultimately, Singaporeans will be  best  served  by\r\n\r\nstrong banks which are able to reap the benefits of scale and\r\n\r\ntechnology, and thereby provide Singaporeans with affordable,\r\n\r\nhigh quality banking services.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Government</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng asked whether the imposition of bank\r\n\r\ncharges  is consistent with the Government's promotion  of  a\r\n\r\ncashless  society.  The  answer is yes.  A  cashless  society\r\n\r\nbenefits all parties - not only the banks, but also companies\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nindividuals who can receive and make payments electronically,\r\n\r\nusing  ATMs and GIRO. Electronic payments are efficient,  and\r\n\r\nmuch  cheaper than traditional transactions. But  they  still\r\n\r\ninvolve  costs,  which  banks  have  to  recover,  at   least\r\n\r\npartially, from companies and individuals who use the system.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not possible for banks simply to absorb these  costs,\r\n\r\nand provide the services for free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked how many Singaporeans maintain\r\n\r\na bank account for GIRO transactions. We do not have an exact\r\n\r\nnumber, but probably every worker in Singapore receives wages\r\n\r\nthrough  GIRO,  which  would be about two  million  accounts.\r\n\r\nHowever,   our   main  concern  should  be  the  lower-income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  This  group  is  often  unable  to  build   up\r\n\r\nsignificant savings in their bank accounts. Yet they need  to\r\n\r\nhave a savings account to receive their salaries, and to  pay\r\n\r\nutilities and telephone bills by GIRO.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to CPF statistics (as at 31st March 2000),\r\n\r\nthere  are about 341,000 active CPF members, aged between  21\r\n\r\nand 55, earning not more than $1,500 per month. These will be\r\n\r\nthe  Singaporeans  who may face difficulties  with  the  bank\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang also asked if the Government\r\n\r\nconsiders  bank charges on lower-income families a  desirable\r\n\r\noutcome of a free-market economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To consumers, no new fee is ever welcome. Even $2 a\r\n\r\nmonth   may   be  an  appreciable  expense  for  lower-income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans. As the NTUC has pointed out, workers  receiving\r\n\r\ntheir  wages by GIRO have little alternative but to  maintain\r\n\r\none  savings  account, yet lower-income workers may  need  to\r\n\r\ndraw  out  most  of their salary once it has  been  paid  in,\r\n\r\nrather than leave $500 in their account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Government intervention in the market, which Mr\r\n\r\nLow   seems  to  be  proposing,  is  not  the  solution.  Our\r\n\r\nfundamental  approach to improving the lives of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nis  to  foster self-reliance, and to avoid state welfare  and\r\n\r\nsubsidies.  The  Government does subsidise  education,  basic\r\n\r\nhealth-care and the assets of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncitizens,  particularly  public  housing.  But  it  does  not\r\n\r\nsubsidise  consumption. In Singapore  consumption  items  are\r\n\r\npriced  at  their  full economic cost, even  essentials  like\r\n\r\nwater, electricity, telephone charges, and basic food-stuffs.\r\n\r\nThe  result  has  been to create an efficient  economy  which\r\n\r\ngenerates many jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach has raised standards of living for all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  and reduced poverty to a very low  level.  Our\r\n\r\nrecord  in  reducing poverty is far better  than  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries   which  have  taken  what  looks   like   a   more\r\n\r\ncompassionate  approach, and used subsidies  and  welfare  to\r\n\r\nhelp  their poor.  In Singapore, essentials of life  are  not\r\n\r\nfree, but nearly everyone can afford them.  We have no reason\r\n\r\nto  treat  bank  charges  differently  from  other  items  of\r\n\r\nconsumption,   and  either  have  them  subsidised   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  or have the Government compel banks  to  provide\r\n\r\nservices for free.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>A Pragmatic Solution</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then can we help lower-income Singaporeans to cope\r\n\r\nwith  the bank charges? Mr Matthias Yao of the NTUC suggested\r\n\r\nthat  in  order to meet the requirement to have a balance  of\r\n\r\n$500  with DBS, lower-income workers could transfer $500 from\r\n\r\ntheir CPF accounts to DBS as a fixed deposit.  DBS could then\r\n\r\nconsider  this  sum sufficient to waive the bank  charges  on\r\n\r\ntheir  savings  accounts.   This is a  practical  suggestion.\r\n\r\nWhile   the   lower-income  workers   may   not   have   much\r\n\r\ndiscretionary  savings,  many of them  have  significant  CPF\r\n\r\nbalances,  even in their Ordinary Accounts.   If  they  could\r\n\r\nmobilise  these  savings, it would help them avoid  the  bank\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF has indeed been planning to liberalise the rules, to\r\n\r\nallow  members to invest more funds from their  CPF  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccounts,  and  even their Special Accounts, with  banks  and\r\n\r\nprivate  fund  managers.  It is doing so not specifically  to\r\n\r\naddress the issue of bank charges, but for long-term reasons,\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  recommendation of Mr  Mah  Bow  Tan's  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on the Ageing Population,  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment had\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccepted.   The objective is for Singaporeans to earn  better\r\n\r\nlong-term  returns for their CPF savings, and thus  build  up\r\n\r\ntheir retirement nest-egg.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liberalisation will naturally apply to all\r\n\r\nqualifying financial institutions, and not just to DBS.   The\r\n\r\ndetails will take a few months to work out, but there  is  no\r\n\r\nin-principle difficulty.  It should be feasible to  lift  the\r\n\r\nrequirement that CPF members maintain the full Minimum Sum in\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF accounts, and to allow them to take out even their\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum, provided it is to invest in a selected class  of\r\n\r\nsafe investments for their retirement needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Matthias Yao's proposal, therefore, is in line with\r\n\r\nthe  Government's policy to free up CPF funds, and allow  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  more  latitude to deploy these  funds  prudently  in\r\n\r\nsuitable  investments  managed by the private  sector,  where\r\n\r\nthey  can  earn  returns equal to and  better  than  the  CPF\r\n\r\ninterest rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS has accepted NTUC's suggestion, and has decided to\r\n\r\ndefer  the  $2 charge and $500 minimum balance on  depositors\r\n\r\nwith one savings account, until the scheme for CPF members to\r\n\r\ntake out their CPF money to deposit or invest is ready.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Affordable Banking Services</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the immediate question of helping workers to meet\r\n\r\nbank charges on small accounts, the longer-term issue is  how\r\n\r\nbanking  services  can be kept affordable, to  businesses  as\r\n\r\nwell as to lower-income Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan expressed concern that further bank\r\n\r\nmergers  in  Singapore would lead to more increases  in  bank\r\n\r\ncharges.  Whether bank charges go up in future will depend on\r\n\r\nthe  costs  that  banks incur in various  transactions.   But\r\n\r\ncharges  should not rise simply as a result of bank  mergers,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  banking  industry in Singapore  is  not  overly\r\n\r\nconcentrated.  In other words, it is not dominated by two  or\r\n\r\nthree  very,  very  big  players.  We have  enough  banks  to\r\n\r\ncompete  against  one another.  The 5 local  banks  presently\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n61% of the market share.  In comparison, in Australia 4 major\r\n\r\nbanks have 68% of the market share, higher than ours, and  in\r\n\r\nCanada  4  major  banks have 70% of the  market  share,  also\r\n\r\nhigher than ours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the biggest bank is DBS which has 26%\r\n\r\nmarket share, about one-quarter, while OCBC, UOB and OUB each\r\n\r\nhas about 10%, and KeppelTatLee Bank has 5%.  Even if two  of\r\n\r\nthese smaller banks merged, the new combined bank would  have\r\n\r\nno  more  than  20% market share.  And then the  two  largest\r\n\r\nbanks - DBS and the new bank - would together have less  than\r\n\r\nhalf  of  the market.  Because DBS has got 26%; the new  bank\r\n\r\nmay  have  20% or less.  So added together, it is  less  than\r\n\r\nhalf.   In comparison, the two largest banks in Hong  Kong  - HSBC  and the Bank of China group - together have 55% of  the\r\n\r\nmarket,  more  than  half.   In Denmark,  another  small  and\r\n\r\ndeveloped market, the two largest banks also have 55%  market\r\n\r\nshare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore banking market is less concentrated than\r\n\r\nin  most other countries.  Bank mergers should therefore  not\r\n\r\nlead  to lack of competition and high bank charges.  However,\r\n\r\nif  this does become a problem, and MAS finds that banks  are\r\n\r\nnot   being  pressured  enough  to  cut  costs  and   improve\r\n\r\nefficiency,  or  they are charging excessive  fees,  it  will\r\n\r\nconsider  opening up the market further to introduce  greater\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that we consider fully\r\n\r\nliberalizing banking in Singapore, so that foreign banks  can\r\n\r\nbe given an opportunity to provide the full range of services\r\n\r\nthat  the  POSBank  provided  in  the  past,  with  unlimited\r\n\r\nbranches in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS is implementing a phased programme of liberalisation\r\n\r\nin  domestic  banking.  Whether or not to liberalise  banking\r\n\r\nfully in Singapore, and allow foreign banks to have unlimited\r\n\r\nbranches  providing  a  full range of services,  is  a  major\r\n\r\npolicy  decision  with implications for our  whole  financial\r\n\r\nsystem.   However, while a liberalised banking industry  will\r\n\r\nresult  in  more  efficient and competitively-priced  banking\r\n\r\nservices, it will not enable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbanks to provide free or subsidised banking services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every banking service involves a cost. POSBank could\r\n\r\nprovide  the  \"free\"  services it did in the  past  precisely\r\n\r\nbecause  banking was a closed-door industry, and banks  could\r\n\r\nreap surplus profits from large depositors to cross-subsidise\r\n\r\nthe  small  accounts.  Now that our banking  environment  has\r\n\r\nbecome  more  open and competitive, it has become  much  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  for any bank to cross-subsidise small accounts  in\r\n\r\nthis  way.   Indeed, most foreign banks in  Singapore  charge\r\n\r\nmore,  or impose higher cut-offs for accepting accounts  than\r\n\r\nlocal banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked if we would consider\r\n\r\nimplementing an alternative to the previous POSBank,  like  a\r\n\r\ncooperative with a banking licence, to encourage savings.  In\r\n\r\nthe  same vein, Mr Seng Han Thong asked how we could  provide\r\n\r\nlow-cost banking facilities for low-income workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to promote thrift and savings,\r\n\r\nespecially among the young.  We must also ensure that workers\r\n\r\nhave  affordable banking facilities.  However, setting  up  a\r\n\r\ncooperative  bank  may  not be the answer.   Like  commercial\r\n\r\nbanks,  cooperative  banks incur costs in  providing  banking\r\n\r\nservices.   If  they  are small, they  will  be  at  a  major\r\n\r\ndisadvantage because they will lack economies of scale, which\r\n\r\nare  becoming  more and more vital for keeping costs  to  the\r\n\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperative banks overseas do charge for their services.\r\n\r\nFor  instance,  several  American and Australian  cooperative\r\n\r\nbanks,  commonly  known  as credit  unions,  charge  fees  on\r\n\r\nsavings  accounts that fall below a minimum sum.   They  also\r\n\r\nlevy  charges on every counter withdrawal, and on  ATM  usage\r\n\r\nabove a stipulated level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cooperative banks justify their charges by\r\n\r\nexplaining that this is an equitable system of cost  sharing:\r\n\r\ncharges  incurred for using particular services are borne  by\r\n\r\nthese  cooperative members using the services.  They  believe\r\n\r\nthat this is fairer for all cooperative members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other cooperative banks do not impose banking charges.\r\n\r\nBut  instead  they charge membership fees.  These  membership\r\n\r\nfees  are  really in lieu of banking charges,  or  a  minimum\r\n\r\naccount balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide the banking industry is undergoing rapid\r\n\r\nconsolidation   and   change.    Banks   are   merging    and\r\n\r\nrationalising, closing branches, saving costs,  and  striving\r\n\r\nto   improve   their  returns  on  equity.   Many   developed\r\n\r\ncountries, for example, Britain, the United States, Australia\r\n\r\nand  New Zealand, are facing the same basic question: how  to\r\n\r\nprovide affordable banking services to the masses?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Zealand is an instructive example. Its banking\r\n\r\nindustry  is  fully  liberalised, leading  to  foreign  banks\r\n\r\nachieving  complete domination of the market.  There  are  no\r\n\r\nmore  New  Zealand banks now.  The New Zealand  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Mr Jim Anderton has recently advocated setting up  a\r\n\r\nPeople's  Bank, also called a Kiwi Bank, which  will  involve\r\n\r\nthe  post office, New Zealand Post [NZ Post].  The Kiwi  Bank\r\n\r\nis  intended to service the low income, as well as people  in\r\n\r\nsmall or rural towns which commercial banks find uneconomical\r\n\r\nto service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Anderton has said that the proposal would not proceed\r\n\r\nunless it was financially viable.  But the Kiwi Bank has  not\r\n\r\nyet been established to be financially viable.  A New Zealand\r\n\r\nacademic, Mr David Tripe, who is a director of the centre for\r\n\r\nbanking  studies  at  Massey  University,  Palmerston   North\r\n\r\nrecently  published an article analysing the  idea.   It  was\r\n\r\ntitled \"Kiwi Bank's Draft of Idealism\" [New Zealand Herald  4\r\n\r\nApril 2000].  He wrote, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The focus of the Kiwi Bank proposal seems to be on the\r\n\r\nissues of bank fees and charges, and geographic shrinkage  in\r\n\r\nthe bank's networks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a common perception that there will be no\r\n\r\ntransaction  charges  [in other words, the  Kiwi  Bank  would\r\n\r\nprovide  services for free].  The reason other  banks  charge\r\n\r\nfor transactions is because they have a cost, and the fairest\r\n\r\nsource  of recovery is from those who impose those  costs  on\r\n\r\nthe banks.  Charges are not imposed because the banks have  a\r\n\r\nsadistic desire to cause misery.  A Kiwi Bank run through  NZ\r\n\r\nPost will have costs for transaction services. . Who will pay\r\n\r\nthese costs?\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be cost for staff providing counter services.\r\n\r\nIt  is  hard  to  see why these costs should be significantly\r\n\r\ndifferent from bank costs in providing the same services.  If\r\n\r\nwe  acknowledge the cost in processing transactions, we  have\r\n\r\nto look at how that cost is recovered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The straightforward solution is to charge the cost to\r\n\r\nthose who incur it - levy customer transaction charges.   But\r\n\r\nthat may not be regarded as acceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose the Government decided that the costs should\r\n\r\njust be added to NZ Post's costs, because it is a state-owned\r\n\r\nenterprise.   [Some  people made that  argument  about  DBS.]\r\n\r\nIncreasing  NZ Post's costs in this way would  be  likely  to\r\n\r\nforce it to increase charges for other services, particularly\r\n\r\npostage.   This  might make NZ Post's services  uncompetitive\r\n\r\ncompared with other operators .\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, the Government could cover transaction\r\n\r\ncosts  by  paying NZ Post a subsidy.  In that case, taxpayers\r\n\r\nin  general would end up paying the costs of transactions for\r\n\r\nKiwi  Bank  customers.   This would  also  give  Kiwi-Bank  a\r\n\r\ntaxpayer-financed  subsidy  to  undercut  other   banks   and\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions  against which  it  was  supposed  to\r\n\r\ncompete.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mr David Tripe did not conclude that the Kiwi Bank\r\n\r\nwas  a  bad idea.  He said he did not have enough information\r\n\r\nto  decide.   But he made it clear that it was not  an  ideal\r\n\r\nsolution.   There  is  always  a  cost  to  conduct   banking\r\n\r\ntransactions,  a  fact not appreciated by  many  people,  and\r\n\r\nsomeone has to pay for it.  The challenge and way forward  is\r\n\r\nto   explore  ways  to  deliver  the  banking  services  more\r\n\r\nefficiently and at lower costs.  Subsidy is not the solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tripe's arguments about the Kiwi Bank apply also to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   But our situation is different from New  Zealand\r\n\r\nand  other  developed  countries, in two important  respects.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  Singapore  is a city, not a country  with  a  rural\r\n\r\npopulation.   So  the  problem of banks  being  unwilling  to\r\n\r\nservice  rural  areas does not arise.  There  are  no  little\r\n\r\nhamlets  and villages with a few hundred people and you  have\r\n\r\nto open a bank branch, and there is no business and no way to\r\n\r\nrecover   the  cost.   We  are  in  cities,  in  new   towns,\r\n\r\nconcentrated,  compact, easily accessible,  easily  serviced.\r\n\r\nBanks  can  service Singaporean customers at quite low  cost,\r\n\r\nalthough not for free.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, while lower-income Singaporean workers may not\r\n\r\nhave  much discretionary savings, most have significant  cash\r\n\r\nbalances  in  their  CPF.  For example, out  of  the  341,000\r\n\r\nactive CPF members earning less than $1,500, only 35,000 have\r\n\r\nless  than $1,000 net balance in their CPF Ordinary Accounts,\r\n\r\nand of these 35,000, 12,000 are below 30 years old.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  as  they work and accumulate CPF, their CPF  balances\r\n\r\nwill  grow.  If we add in their Special Account, then  lower-income Singaporeans have even more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once CPF members can take these balances out to invest\r\n\r\nfor  long-term  retirement purposes, and earn better  returns\r\n\r\nthan  the  CPF  can offer, they will become highly  desirable\r\n\r\ncustomers  of financial institutions.  Banks will court  them\r\n\r\nfor  the privilege of managing their retirement funds,  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  a stable, long term source of funding and  business\r\n\r\nfor the banks.  Under these circumstances, banks will need no\r\n\r\nencouragement to provide these \"low-income\" Singaporeans with\r\n\r\nbasic banking services that are accessible and affordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Given that there is a perception that\r\n\r\nPOSBank was given to DBS \"on a silver platter\", and therefore\r\n\r\nby  extension,  there is the expectation  that  some  of  the\r\n\r\nsocial features should remain at least for quite a while, can\r\n\r\nthe  DPM kindly recap the reasons for not putting the POSBank\r\n\r\nbusiness  out  for  tender by the other  non-Government-owned\r\n\r\nbanks?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this was fully\r\n\r\ndebated at the time the question arose why we gave POSBank on\r\n\r\na  \"silver platter\" to DBS Bank.  In fact, it was not  given.\r\n\r\nThere   was   a   valuation.   There  was  an  arm's   length\r\n\r\ntransaction.   POSBank was sold to DBS Bank for $1.6  billion\r\n\r\nworth of shares of DBS Bank.  This was two years ago, and DBS\r\n\r\nBank  shares  have  not  done  badly  since  then.   So   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has actually sold POSBank to DBS Bank for  a  very\r\n\r\nfair and substantial consideration.  But the reason we did it\r\n\r\nwith  DBS, rather than with any other bank, or put it  up  to\r\n\r\ntender,  is because we had a social objective: we  wanted  to\r\n\r\npromote savings, we had to consider the phasing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  of  the full commercial rigours of the operation  and  we\r\n\r\nwere  assured that DBS Bank would have a similar mindset  and\r\n\r\nwould  understand this.  And indeed, arrangements were worked\r\n\r\nout  with  DBS  Bank  to make sure that their  proposed  bank\r\n\r\nlending rates, for example, would only be phased in gradually\r\n\r\nover  a period of four or five years.  And at the same  time,\r\n\r\nto  compensate  for that, the tax exemption  on  the  POSBank\r\n\r\ndeposits was also going to be phased out gradually, first, on\r\n\r\nbig  accounts next year, and then on all accounts come  2004.\r\n\r\nSo there would be progressive steps forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, of course, we were encouraging\r\n\r\nSingapore banks to merge and we wanted to build up  a  strong\r\n\r\nnational  champion, a player which would be  substantial  and\r\n\r\nefficient in Singapore and also in the region.  And we cannot\r\n\r\ngo  round  telling  the  private  banks  that  they  have  to\r\n\r\nrationalise  and they would look at us and say,  \"What  about\r\n\r\nyou,  DBS and POSBank?\"  It makes sense.

Why is it  that\r\n\r\na  hugely  profitable bank, like DBS, should not absorb  what\r\n\r\nseems to be a negligible cost?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, the\r\n\r\npeople's  bank  is an emotive idea.

For a long time,  it\r\n\r\nwas  able to do so by cross-subsidising from the big accounts\r\n\r\nto  the  small  accounts, paying big accounts less  interest,\r\n\r\nproviding  the small accounts services for free and absorbing\r\n\r\nthe  cost, and Singaporeans tolerated it out of habit.   They\r\n\r\nbanked  with  POSBank for many years, they  continued  to  do\r\n\r\nthat.  But Singaporeans nowadays, as MPs will know, are  very\r\n\r\nsharp, pencil-sharpeners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThey calculate exactly where their money goes, how much it is\r\n\r\nearning  and they want to put their money to work  for  them.\r\n\r\nSo  POSBank was finding that by offering bigger deposits less\r\n\r\ninterest,  it was losing deposits.  Singaporeans  would  say,\r\n\r\n\"You may be tax free, but I have made my calculations, and  I\r\n\r\nam  going  elsewhere.   Never mind  the  tax,  I  get  better\r\n\r\nservice, I get overall better return.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So POSBank was reaching a position where it was unable\r\n\r\nto  continue  with these free services and, as I  quoted  Tan\r\n\r\nCheng  Bock  and  other MPs too who spoke,  for  many  years,\r\n\r\nPOSBank has been pondering this problem, what to do about  it\r\n\r\nand  how  to  introduce charges in a way which is acceptable.\r\n\r\nFinally,  we decided better make a break, and transferred  it\r\n\r\nover  to DBS Bank.  There will be a transition.  There is  an\r\n\r\ninterest  in promoting savings and thrift, and in encouraging\r\n\r\nparticularly  children,  and servicing  national  servicemen.\r\n\r\nBut  it  has to move to a commercial basis of operation.   So\r\n\r\nthe  services  will be charged properly,  but  they  will  be\r\n\r\naffordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS makes so much money. Why cannot it just absorb it?\r\n\r\nYou  can ask: the Government makes so much money, why  cannot\r\n\r\nit  absorb this?  The reason the Government is not  broke  is\r\n\r\nbecause we are very careful with our money and we only  spend\r\n\r\nit when there is a strong merit.  And similarly, with DBS, or\r\n\r\nany other commercial operation.  Every proposition has to  be\r\n\r\nviable.  DBS earns a profit.  Is it humongous?  Well,  it  is\r\n\r\nbigger than it used to be.  But if you look at the return  on\r\n\r\nequity, it is below 10%.  It is not a respectable return.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam just now had an argument with Dr John Chen\r\n\r\nas  to  why  bus companies need to earn respectable  returns.\r\n\r\nAll  corporations have to earn respectable returns.  That  is\r\n\r\nthe  way  the  market works.  If there were no  returns,  why\r\n\r\nshould  anybody buy DBS Bank shares?  Why should  DBS  be  in\r\n\r\nbusiness?   If  it  is  a Government department  providing  a\r\n\r\nservice  which  is absolutely necessary, and  which  provides\r\n\r\nreturns to the whole society, like education or public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhousing, then we say, yes, we subsidise.  If it is a  service\r\n\r\nwhich  is  provided to a person, or a family, and the  family\r\n\r\nneeds  it and benefits from it, it may be essential, but  our\r\n\r\nphilosophy is, better let the service be priced, be  charged,\r\n\r\nthe   family  can  pay.   Because  the  economy  is  properly\r\n\r\nstructured that way without distortions and subsidies,  there\r\n\r\nare  jobs, families have opportunities, they can earn income,\r\n\r\nand  so  Singaporeans can pay their PUB bills, SingTel bills,\r\n\r\neven  handphone  bills.   One day,  somebody  would  make  an\r\n\r\nargument  here  that handphones are essential and  should  be\r\n\r\nsubsidised.  We have not reached that point yet.  But that is\r\n\r\nthe direction which we have deliberately not gone and I think\r\n\r\nit has served us well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS, being a commercial operation, all the more it has\r\n\r\nto  break even and every proposition has to be viable.   And,\r\n\r\nas  DBS has explained, even if they charge $2 on these  small\r\n\r\naccounts,  they are not going to make money.  They are  still\r\n\r\nlosing   money.   These  are  realities  which  we  have   to\r\n\r\nunderstand and acknowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transition is difficult because we have become used\r\n\r\nto it.  For many years, we had it for free.  So now it is not\r\n\r\nfree.   So  although $2 is not an enormous amount  of  money,\r\n\r\neven a bowl of kway teow costs $2, the emotional reaction  is\r\n\r\nthere.   It is understandable.  So I think it is our  job  to\r\n\r\ntry  and  help to explain, and find workable solutions  which\r\n\r\nwill  solve  the problem for the long term in a  proper  way.\r\n\r\nThe  arrangement  to have CPF members to be  able  to  invest\r\n\r\ntheir  own money with banks, financial institutions  or  fund\r\n\r\nmanagement  and they provide them a package of  services  and\r\n\r\nthis  $2  fee, or whatever it is, becomes just a  small  item\r\n\r\nbecause  he becomes a significant customer.  That is  a  good\r\n\r\nlong-term  approach  because we  want  workers  to  be  self-reliant,  we  want them to have more retirement  savings,  we\r\n\r\nwant them to make their own decisions and judge.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  from  MAS'  point  of view,  we  also  want  the  fund\r\n\r\nmanagement industry and the banks to develop rather than have\r\n\r\nthe Government to choke everything.  So it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  something which we can work out and, within the next  six\r\n\r\nmonths, we would be able to work out packages and we would be\r\n\r\nable  to offer entirely reasonable menus.  And I am sure  DBS\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  the  only bank which would be  offering  such\r\n\r\npackages.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these\r\n\r\nfunds  at  the  moment placed in the CPF  are  risk-free  and\r\n\r\nguaranteed  by  the  Government.   In  the  instance  whereby\r\n\r\nmembers  transfer  their funds into fixed deposits  with  the\r\n\r\nbanks  for  the purpose of maintaining the Minimum Sum,  will\r\n\r\nthe Government guarantee these funds placed with the banks?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that DPM mentioned earlier that\r\n\r\nthe  returns placed with the banks would be higher  than  the\r\n\r\nCPF  interest rates.  But there are instances whereby the CPF\r\n\r\nBoard pays higher interest rates than the fixed deposit rates\r\n\r\nof  the  banks.  So how can we ensure that the  funds  placed\r\n\r\nwith  the banks by lower income Singaporeans will not end  up\r\n\r\nto  be  worse  off?   In other words, to maintain  a  minimum\r\n\r\nbalance, they are actually getting a lower interest rate than\r\n\r\nwhat they should be getting by leaving it with the CPF Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is the idea raised by Mr Indjerit Singh\r\n\r\non  a  cooperative bank.  Before I ask the question, I  would\r\n\r\nlike to declare that I am a Director of NTUC Thrift and Loan.\r\n\r\nIn  the  instance of the cooperative unions in Australia  and\r\n\r\nthe US, the surpluses made by the cooperative unions actually\r\n\r\ngo  back to the members.  In other words, although members do\r\n\r\nhave  some  form of cross-subsidy at the front end when  they\r\n\r\npay  the  fees,  at the end of the day, all  the  profits  or\r\n\r\nsurpluses  made  by  the cooperative union  go  back  to  the\r\n\r\nmembers,  and not to a group of shareholders.  So  there  are\r\n\r\nsome  merits  to  consider that there could  be  room  for  a\r\n\r\ncooperative bank in Singapore, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,\r\n\r\nthere  is no Government guarantee.  The whole idea of letting\r\n\r\nworkers look after their own funds is for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthem to decide what they are going to do with it.  Some would\r\n\r\nbe  safer options, others would be more volatile options, but\r\n\r\nperhaps  offer a higher average return, and the worker  would\r\n\r\nlook  at  his  own profile and choose.  If you want  to  say,\r\n\r\n\"Give  me  a  guarantee, at the same time offer me  a  higher\r\n\r\nreturn so that I have my cake and eat it.\", I am afraid  that\r\n\r\nis  not  possible.  If you are talking about fixed  deposits,\r\n\r\nthen  the returns from the banks would be about the  same  as\r\n\r\nwhat  the CPF is able to offer, because the CPF interest rate\r\n\r\nis  pegged  to the private sector fixed deposit  and  savings\r\n\r\nrate.   But if you are talking about retirement accounts,  in\r\n\r\nother  words, I take the money, I am not just putting it  for\r\n\r\nsix months, or one year, or two years' fixed deposits, but to\r\n\r\nbe  invested  for my retirement, hopefully, many  years  from\r\n\r\nnow,  then that is a different ball game altogether.  Because\r\n\r\nthen,  the bank knows that this money is available,  it  will\r\n\r\nnot  be withdrawn at short notice.  They can invest it  in  a\r\n\r\nrange of assets.  Typically, a retirement account can earn 5%-7% on average, some years more, some years less.  Whereas the\r\n\r\nCPF offers an interest rate which is based on the savings and\r\n\r\nfixed  deposit account.  So I think that if you  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout  retirement  accounts, then we will be  able  to  offer\r\n\r\nhigher  returns and better long term prospects  for  the  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers.  And we are going to change our CPF rules so that we\r\n\r\nallow the whole menu to be offered by banks rather than  just\r\n\r\none option.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask\r\n\r\nDPM  whether  DBS or POSB has considered the  alternative  of\r\n\r\ncharging  by transactions before imposing this $2  per  month\r\n\r\ncharge?   Because for the small depositors, they merely  have\r\n\r\none  or  two  transactions per month.   Therefore,  they  are\r\n\r\nactually  using  much  less bank services,  compared  to  the\r\n\r\nbigger  depositors who have several transactions  per  month.\r\n\r\nThat may be a fairer method for the low income depositors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether the bank has considered\r\n\r\nother  means  to  provide low cost or no-frills  services  to\r\n\r\nthese low income depositors.  For example, could\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPOSBank  consider setting up a no-frills or low-cost division\r\n\r\nto service these depositors who could therefore be charged  a\r\n\r\nlower rate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have just heard from DPM that there are 5.2\r\n\r\nmillion savings accounts.  Many of these accounts seem to  be\r\n\r\ndormant  accounts.   Could there be a  rule  to  enforce  the\r\n\r\nclosure  of dormant accounts so that there could be  a  lower\r\n\r\ncost base for POSBank?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these are\r\n\r\npropositions  which  are best addressed at  the  DBS'  Annual\r\n\r\nGeneral  Meeting  of  shareholders.  It  is  fair  to  impose\r\n\r\ntransaction  charges  and I think DBS would  have  to  impose\r\n\r\ntransaction charges.  But the question is: what is the  base?\r\n\r\nIf I open an account, then the understanding must be that the\r\n\r\naccount   will   be  used  for  at  least  one   transaction.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  why do I have an account?  If I  buy  a  car,   I\r\n\r\nassume  it comes with tyres and a steering wheel.  The  radio\r\n\r\nmay  be  optional,  the sun roof may be  optional.   But,  at\r\n\r\nleast,  it comes with the tyres and steering wheel.   And  if\r\n\r\nyou  are  having an account, there are certain basic expenses\r\n\r\nwhich  the bank would have to undertake or incur:  first,  to\r\n\r\nopen the account, second, to maintain the records, third,  to\r\n\r\ncompute your interest, and fourth, maybe, just to do  one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  transactions a month.  So it is really for DBS to decide\r\n\r\nhow  they want to charge.  If it makes better sense to charge\r\n\r\nby  transactions rather than to charge an account  fee,  then\r\n\r\nthere  will  be other banks which will offer such a  charging\r\n\r\nbasis and Singaporeans will be able to choose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, whether we can have a lower cost bank, a basic\r\n\r\nno-frills  bank, it is possible if you want  to  do  it.   My\r\n\r\nsense  of  the industry is that the bigger the bank  is,  the\r\n\r\nlower  its overheads.  And the more you try and cut this  out\r\n\r\nand  present it as a no-frills business, the more your  costs\r\n\r\nare  going to be.  Because you have to have a large  customer\r\n\r\nbase  in  order  to have the ATMs, in order  to  justify  the\r\n\r\ncomputer  system,  in order to provide the services  and  the\r\n\r\ncall  answering  services,  and  to  be  able  to  make   the\r\n\r\ntransactions with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nother  banks.   If you do your own and you try and  carve  it\r\n\r\nout, I think your unit costs are going to go up.  Again, this\r\n\r\nis  a  market matter.  If it were true that it is attractive,\r\n\r\nsomebody would do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is your third question?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Dormant accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> To have the Government close the\r\n\r\ndormant   accounts,  I  think  that  would  have  been   very\r\n\r\ndifficult.   Banks have to keep records.   You  look  at  the\r\n\r\nSwiss  bank accounts from the Second World War of  the  Jews.\r\n\r\nFifty  years  later, the grandchildren are  coming  to  claim\r\n\r\nthem.   And you want me to close them?  What will I  do  with\r\n\r\nthe  money?  If it goes to the Government, there will be  big\r\n\r\ntrouble.   So,  I  think  that  is  not  really  a  practical\r\n\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the DPM aware that the US\r\n\r\ngovernment  is  subsidising low income  families  to  operate\r\n\r\nchecking accounts?  It is reported in today's Lianhe  Zaobao.\r\n\r\nBased  on  the rationale explained by DPM on the  subsidy  of\r\n\r\nconsumer  services  and what he termed as  banking  services,\r\n\r\ndoes he think that the US government is being irrational?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether the Government will\r\n\r\nconsider  opening up the domestic banking market by  allowing\r\n\r\nlocal  finance companies to operate banking services to serve\r\n\r\nsmall  depositors  who  will need just simple  basic  banking\r\n\r\nservices.  DPM does not need to worry too much whether or not\r\n\r\nthese  are  viable.  Because when you open up,  some  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies may offer banking service for free. The question is\r\n\r\nwhether the Government is prepared to open up the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, firstly on the American\r\n\r\ngovernment,  it  is  not  for us to  pass  judgement  on  the\r\n\r\nAmerican  government, least of all, on a one sentence  report\r\n\r\nin  Lianhe  Zaobao, as reported by Mr Low Thia  Khiang.  They\r\n\r\nhave a different approach.  We have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexplained our rationale. Cheques are a very integral part  of\r\n\r\nthe  American financial system.  It is not a positive feature\r\n\r\nbut  it is the way they work.  They write cheques for $2, $5,\r\n\r\n$7,  small sums, and it costs $1 or $2 to clear each  cheque.\r\n\r\nBut  that  is the way their system is and they have not  been\r\n\r\nable  to rationalise.  So perhaps that is one reason why they\r\n\r\nhave  had  no  choice but to subsidise.  But  that  is  their\r\n\r\nproblem. We do not have that problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as to whether we would give a banking licence\r\n\r\nto  a  finance  company, I think that is a totally  different\r\n\r\nproposition. A bank is a bank, a finance company is a finance\r\n\r\ncompany.  The reason that we have not given banking  licences\r\n\r\nprofligately  is  because  a banking  licence  carries  great\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to operate in a very tight  manner,  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  the deposits are safe and that the depositors  do\r\n\r\nnot  lose  their  money.  Finance companies operate  well  as\r\n\r\nfinance  companies, but to say that because it is  a  finance\r\n\r\ncompany,  let  us  make it a bank, and it  will  offer  cheap\r\n\r\nservices  - when a bank comes along and says, \"I am  offering\r\n\r\nsomething  very  cheap\", that is when banking regulators  get\r\n\r\nquite worried and start to look very carefully to see whether\r\n\r\nthere is something not quite right.  So I do not think it  is\r\n\r\na  wise  thing to say that the Government will give a banking\r\n\r\nlicence  to  anybody.  Can the person make good  use  of  the\r\n\r\nbanking  licence,  operate a good bank and  provide  services\r\n\r\nwhich  are  safe  for Singaporeans?  If so,  he  can  have  a\r\n\r\nlicence.  If not, that is unwise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest-cost banking service most likely in the next\r\n\r\nphase will be Internet banking, no branches, no counters.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  branch, every time when you go there,  it  will\r\n\r\ncharge  you  a  few dollars just to say hello to  the  teller\r\n\r\nbecause  it costs money to keep the teller there and  to  pay\r\n\r\nrent on the branch.  You use ATMs, dial up on the Internet or\r\n\r\ndo  phone  banking.  It is growing in the developed countries\r\n\r\nand  is something that we are studying now on how we can also\r\n\r\nintroduce it in Singapore.  The costs are significantly lower\r\n\r\nthan having the bricks\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  mortar  but,  at  the same time, it is  something  which\r\n\r\ncustomers will take a while to get used to, particularly  for\r\n\r\nthe  older  Singaporeans.  If you tell  them  about  Internet\r\n\r\nbanking, it is not so easy. Even I find it difficult to  pick\r\n\r\nup  a phone and it says, \"If you want to find out the account\r\n\r\nbalance,  press  1, if not, press 2 and  so  on.\"   But  some\r\n\r\npeople  tell  me that it is easy to do so.  I  will  have  to\r\n\r\nlearn harder, but old folks will find it even more difficult.\r\n\r\nIt  is something which we will have to allow to phase in over\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I welcome the suggestion of CPF\r\n\r\nmoney  being transferred to banks other than DBS.  But  given\r\n\r\nthe  current  situation of the many branches  that  DBS  has,\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the other banks, Singaporeans  will  be  forced\r\n\r\nanyway to go to DBS because it is more than just savings  for\r\n\r\nretirement.  They  need  to  use  the  bank  for  many  other\r\n\r\ntransactions.   Can  I  request  the  DPM  to  consider   the\r\n\r\nsuggestion of giving approval to banks to have more  branches\r\n\r\nand  ATMs  before  implementing this CPF transfer  scheme  to\r\n\r\nalleviate this problem of $2?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I have is back to the suggestion of\r\n\r\na  cooperative  bank.   I  think it  is  a  suggestion  worth\r\n\r\nconsidering.   We  have  proven  in  many  cases   that   the\r\n\r\ncooperative type of approach does provide an alternative  and\r\n\r\nviable  approach for many other services. This includes  NTUC\r\n\r\nFairprice  in  the  food services. In  fact,  NTUC  has  been\r\n\r\ninvolved  in housing and there are many other examples  where\r\n\r\nthe cooperative system has provided a viable alternative to a\r\n\r\ncommercial deal.  I think maybe we should give an opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  a cooperative bank to work and perhaps NTUC may want  to\r\n\r\ntake  up the challenge to open up a cooperative bank  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is willing to issue a licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, first of all on ATMs. While\r\n\r\nDBS  has  the widest branch network, the other banks  have  a\r\n\r\nvery wide ATM network that is equal size to DBS Bank.  If  it\r\n\r\nis  just  a matter of withdrawing your salary which has  been\r\n\r\ngiroed  in  every  month, you can have  an  ATM  anywhere  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, whichever bank\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyou bank in.

If  NTUC  submits  an\r\n\r\napplication,  MAS  will have to consider it  very  seriously.\r\n\r\nBut  I  do not think it is a matter which NTUC will  be  well\r\n\r\nadvised  lightly to go into.  It is very difficult to  run  a\r\n\r\nbank. Even people who are very competent at running big banks\r\n\r\nfind  it difficult to make money.

As I have\r\n\r\nexplained,  most of the POSBank accounts - even when  it  was\r\n\r\nwith  POSBank  -  three quarters of their accounts  were  not\r\n\r\nprofitable, losing money.  And if DBS takes over, it  has  to\r\n\r\nprogressively rationalise this and that is what DBS has done.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for the bank to say, \"I will provide these\r\n\r\nservices completely for free.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly every bank in the world will have a certain\r\n\r\ndegree  of cross-subsidy between the bigger accounts and  the\r\n\r\nsmaller  accounts because there is a benefit to the  bank  of\r\n\r\nhaving  a  catchment of customers, and of having people  whom\r\n\r\nyou can potentially do other business with.  You can sell him\r\n\r\ninsurance, unit trusts or you can do something else for  him,\r\n\r\nif  he  needs to buy a bank draft or to transfer some  money.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  worth  the bank's while to carry  some  of  these\r\n\r\naccounts  which are not profitable.  But it is a question  of\r\n\r\ndegree  -  how  much you can afford to lose on  each  of  the\r\n\r\naccounts  and what is sensible.  And I think DBS has  decided\r\n\r\nthat  zero-dollar charge is not sensible. All the other banks\r\n\r\nhave already decided this,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot just the local banks, but even the foreign banks. So they\r\n\r\nhave  decided that with $2, they still lose money,  but  they\r\n\r\nlose  a little bit less, and because they lose a little less,\r\n\r\nthey are a little bit less unhappy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\njust  like  to find out whether in the civil service  or  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards, there is a directive or feeling among  the\r\n\r\nheads  of  the various Government departments that  the  then\r\n\r\nPOSBank,  and now DBS, should be the only bank that should be\r\n\r\nused to bank in the salaries of the staff. The reason is that\r\n\r\nin  the past, it was captive and some of these services  were\r\n\r\nfree.   Now  that it has changed, and given the  Government's\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the banking sector, is there a directive?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if an employee from the civil service wishes\r\n\r\nto  choose the bank that the salary should be banked into, is\r\n\r\nhe or she able to do so?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, as far as I know, there is no\r\n\r\ndirective and an employee can be paid his salary to any  bank\r\n\r\nhe wants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I ask the DPM about his point on\r\n\r\nthe gain of the society as a whole and who pays?  We focus so\r\n\r\nfar  on the idea that either DBS absorbs the cost or the bank\r\n\r\naccount holders do.  But there seems to me to be a benefit to\r\n\r\nthe  whole  society  in  having these  accounts.  Should  not\r\n\r\nserious  consideration be given to support  Giro  schemes  by\r\n\r\nhaving Government target subsidies for low income people  who\r\n\r\ncannot afford it?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is: given that employers and people\r\n\r\nwho  take out money from accounts also benefit by having Giro\r\n\r\nschemes,  such as telecommunications, PUB bills, etc,  should\r\n\r\nnot they contribute to the cost of maintaining low accounts?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, is it the Government's policy to avoid a sector\r\n\r\nof  population  not having bank accounts  which  could  be  a\r\n\r\nfallout of this?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> First of all, the question that\r\n\r\nsomebody  must pay, why should it not be the Government?   If\r\n\r\nit  is  desirable, yes, we want to have a charge and we  also\r\n\r\nwant  to have cash-free payments.  Is it affordable for  most\r\n\r\nof  the population?  Candidly, yes.  $2 is not going to  bust\r\n\r\nyou.  Is it necessary for the Government to subsidise in  the\r\n\r\nsame way as it subsidises education or basic healthcare?   Is\r\n\r\nit different from water or electricity or rubbish collection?\r\n\r\nI  would  say no, it is not different from water, electricity\r\n\r\nor rubbish collection.  That is your first point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On your second point that employers should pay, I fully\r\n\r\nagree.  Whether it is Singapore Telecom or PUB, if  they  are\r\n\r\nusing the Giro services, they benefit, then they should cover\r\n\r\nthe  cost  rather the banks covering the cost.  I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  this has not been the practice in the past but it  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be the practice in the future.  Even if they  cover\r\n\r\npart  of  the cost of the Giro transfer - every Giro transfer\r\n\r\ncosts  money -  DBS told me that it costs about 40  cents  to\r\n\r\nmake  a salary transaction and more than that to make a water\r\n\r\nor  electricity transaction.  Even if they do that, there  is\r\n\r\nstill  the  cost of maintaining an account, of providing  the\r\n\r\nATM  service for the salary earner to withdraw the money,  of\r\n\r\nprinting  the  statements,  calculating  the  statements  and\r\n\r\nmailing  the statements.  That alone costs 50 cents a  month.\r\n\r\nSo there are basic costs which cannot be avoided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point as to whether this would lead to a\r\n\r\nsituation  where some people will not be able to afford  bank\r\n\r\naccounts  at all, as I have explained, because of Singapore's\r\n\r\nunique circumstances, that is not likely to happen and nearly\r\n\r\neverybody will be able to afford a bank account.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nunaffordable.  If there is a very small minority  who  really\r\n\r\nhas  a  problem, then we can treat it in the same way  as  we\r\n\r\ntreat   assistance  from  the  CDCs  or  the  MCDS's   public\r\n\r\nassistance  cases to subvent those target groups,  rather  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  to  say,  \"Since there are a few people  who  cannot\r\n\r\nafford it, I make it free for everybody.\"  I think that is  a\r\n\r\nwrong  approach.   There are a lot of people  who  are  quite\r\n\r\nemotionally\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenraged or upset, perhaps out of sympathy, but certainly  not\r\n\r\nbecause  they themselves cannot afford it.  They can  afford,\r\n\r\nbut they feel that somebody else cannot.  If there is a small\r\n\r\ngroup which cannot pay, we look after that small group.   Let\r\n\r\nus  not  all  get agitated and particularly let  us  not  get\r\n\r\nagitated  to  the extent of thinking that most people  cannot\r\n\r\npay, because that is not true.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I think the small\r\n\r\naccount holders are in fact upset with DBS' decision  on  the\r\n\r\n$2  charge  simply because they have no option as  they  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be charged because it is for Giro payments.   In\r\n\r\nthe  light that DBS is carrying a large proportion of POSBank\r\n\r\naccount holders, is it not the moral obligation and corporate\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  DBS to ensure that it minimises  as  much\r\n\r\ndisruption as possible for a large proportion of these  small\r\n\r\ntime  account holders?  I know that the suggestion by DPM  is\r\n\r\nthat CPF could be used to offset part of this cost but we are\r\n\r\nopening  up a new pandora's box in the sense that CPF savings\r\n\r\nare  for  retirement and would it stop there because  we  are\r\n\r\ntransferring money to fixed deposit savings accounts?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question I would like to raise is that there\r\n\r\nare  those  who  are self-employed who do not  have  any  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings and they are also low income earners.  How are  their\r\n\r\nproblems  going to be solved?  Fourthly, are there any  long-term solutions, other than this CPF fixed deposit arrangement\r\n\r\nthat is being made?  Since the Government has been making CPF\r\n\r\ntop-ups  from  time to time, can every Singaporean  be  given\r\n\r\nthis  top-up  as  a base so that they would have  an  account\r\n\r\navailable and all these transactions could be managed?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, first of all, whether DBS has\r\n\r\na  moral obligation to look after these people, the answer is\r\n\r\nthat  DBS is looking after these people, not just because  of\r\n\r\nmoral  obligation  but because they want to  make  sure  that\r\n\r\ntheir  customers  are reasonably looked  after.   As  I  have\r\n\r\nexplained,  19  months  have passed  since  DBS  merged  with\r\n\r\nPOSBank\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  adjustments have been made in many other areas, and  now\r\n\r\nthis  area  has to be changed. There is never  a  good  time.\r\n\r\nWhenever  you  do  it, there is always a step  to  be  taken.\r\n\r\nRight at the beginning, the Government has served notice  and\r\n\r\nDBS  has  also  explained  that  some  adjustments  will   be\r\n\r\nnecessary  and  this  is  one  of  the  adjustment  which  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.   $2 is not welcome, but I have said,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nhuge and most people will find it affordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, are we opening a new pandora's box? The\r\n\r\nanswer  is no, we are not.  We are opening another window  to\r\n\r\nliberalise  rules  which have become really too  constrictive\r\n\r\nover  time.   When  there  were  no  instruments,  when   the\r\n\r\npopulation  was illiterate, when the financial  industry  was\r\n\r\nnot well developed, it made sense for us to say you keep your\r\n\r\nmoney  in the CPF and we lock it up.  Now that the population\r\n\r\nis  educated, now that they have more savings, now that there\r\n\r\nare many alternative avenues of investing your money, because\r\n\r\nthe  financial industry has grown, and Singaporeans  want  to\r\n\r\nsee  their  money grow properly because they  regularly  say,\r\n\r\n\"Why  such  low CPF returns?\",  I think it is right  for  us,\r\n\r\nprogressively, to liberalise and allow people to  take  their\r\n\r\nmoney  out,  not  to  spend, but to invest  for  purposes  of\r\n\r\nretirement,  either in a fixed deposit or into  a  retirement\r\n\r\naccount  or  some  other form of investments  appropriate  to\r\n\r\ntheir  financial  needs.  It is how people look  after  their\r\n\r\nretirement  needs in many countries in the world, whether  it\r\n\r\nis  Britain, whether it is America particularly.   Even  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  is  now setting up what is called a Mandatory Provident\r\n\r\nFund,  a compulsory contribution but with the private sector,\r\n\r\nnot managed by the government.  So I think allowing banks and\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions to manage more of the  CPF  money  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  is  the  right  direction  to  go  in  a   very\r\n\r\nfundamental sort of way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo's third question is answered by his fourth\r\n\r\nquestion.  He asked what about the self-employed and can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  top  up.  The answer is that the  Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen  topping up.  In fact, we have just paid $250 this  year\r\n\r\ninto everybody's accounts.  This is not the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfirst  time.  So even the self-employed should have a  little\r\n\r\nbit of money in their CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, it took 19 months\r\n\r\nfor the DBS/POSB to charge $2.  How long will this $2 minimum\r\n\r\ncharge  be maintained before the full cost of the service  is\r\n\r\ncharged?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I do not know. This is a\r\n\r\nmatter for DBS to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  disadvantageous for depositors  to  transfer\r\n\r\ntheir  money  from the CPF to the POSBank,  because,  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment, the CPF pays more interest than the POSBank?  Second,\r\n\r\nthe DPM mentioned earlier that he would subvent a small group\r\n\r\nwho  cannot pay.  May I ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether\r\n\r\nit  is useful to set up, through means testing, a register of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans eligible for different Governmental subsidies so\r\n\r\nthat appropriation of help can be more effectively granted to\r\n\r\nthose merit cases?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Firstly, CPF interest rates are\r\n\r\nhigher  than  commercial  fixed deposit  rates  now.   But  I\r\n\r\nbelieve DBS has offered their package as being at the same as\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  rate, which is 21/2%.  So there is no loss  to  the\r\n\r\ndepositors who transfer their money over.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of means testing so that you know who is\r\n\r\neligible  for various Government help is something  which  we\r\n\r\nhave to study.  It is not just apropos this because this is a\r\n\r\nsmall  amount,  but  in general.  If  we  want  to  make  our\r\n\r\nassistance  targeted to reach the people who  need  it  most,\r\n\r\nthen,  as I explained just now in answer to Mr Simon Tay,  it\r\n\r\nmakes more sense to focus our attention on that group, rather\r\n\r\nthan  to make the whole service cheap when maybe only  5%  or\r\n\r\n10%  of  the people using that service are going to need  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy, and the rest maybe are middle or high income earners\r\n\r\nand they also benefit from a subsidy unnecessarily.  So it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsomething  which we have to study.  It is not so easy  to  do\r\n\r\nbecause when you have a means test, you also have a cut  off.\r\n\r\nAnd there will be people at the boundaries just below or just\r\n\r\nabove  the cut off and they just missed it, and you not  only\r\n\r\nare  unjust to the person who has just crossed the  line  but\r\n\r\nyou  also  encourage people to put themselves just below  the\r\n\r\nline,  so that they will benefit from the subsidy.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nproblem  which the welfare countries have in an  acute  form.\r\n\r\nIn  America  and in Britain, they call it the  poverty  trap.\r\n\r\nBut I think we will have to study this carefully, apropos our\r\n\r\noverall policies on helping the very low income Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, the CPF solution that the DPM\r\n\r\ntalked  about  can  work for those with CPF  accounts.

Liberalising CPF does not arise from DBS.  Liberalising\r\n\r\nCPF  arises from Mr Mah Bow Tan's Inter-Ministerial Committee\r\n\r\non  the  Ageing  Population, which had many  discussions  and\r\n\r\npublished  a  report, which I am sure Dr Tan Cheng  Bock  has\r\n\r\nread,  and  which explained that it was necessary for  us  to\r\n\r\nliberalise the CPF accounts, so that members would be able to\r\n\r\ninvest  them  for  better returns, and also to  have  savings\r\n\r\nabove  the  CPF.  As a result, the Government  accepted  that\r\n\r\nreport  and so the Finance Minister, in the Budget  Statement\r\n\r\nthis year, introduced the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSupplementary Retirement Scheme.  And as Dr Lee Boon Yang has\r\n\r\nsaid and as I have confirmed, we have also been studying ways\r\n\r\nto   liberalise  the  CPF  accounts  itself  to  remove   the\r\n\r\nrequirement to keep the minimum balance in cash in the CPF to\r\n\r\nallow  the whole of the Ordinary Account to be invested,  and\r\n\r\neven  to  allow the Special Account to be invested,  although\r\n\r\nthe  Special  Account probably will have to  be  invested  in\r\n\r\nsafer assets and instruments.  That is point number one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point number 2 is, out of the 341,000 people, how many\r\n\r\nof  them cannot afford to have $500?  As I have said, out  of\r\n\r\n341,000  people,  only  35,000  have  less  than  $1,000  net\r\n\r\nbalance, and one-third of these are below 30 years  old.

In view of  the  imposition  of\r\n\r\nPOSBank's minimum charge, would DPM encourage POSBank's small\r\n\r\naccount  holders to march out of POSBank and to open accounts\r\n\r\nwith some other banks?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I do not understand the question\r\n\r\nabout checking accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would the charges on checking\r\n\r\naccounts push Singapore into a cashless society?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Do you mean that we ought to charge\r\n\r\nfor cheques in order to persuade people to go cashless?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> No, that is not the purpose. If the\r\n\r\ncheapest way to do it is by cheque, then we let people do  it\r\n\r\nby  cheque.  If the cheapest way is by cash, we let people do\r\n\r\nit  by cash.  If the cheapest way is by Giro, then they go by\r\n\r\nGiro or ATM.  But each one has a cost and each cost ought  to\r\n\r\nbe  reflected.  Our problem is that none of these  costs  has\r\n\r\nbeen  reflected, and everything has been apparently free  and\r\n\r\nwe  have  been applying moral suasion, telling people  it  is\r\n\r\ngood  for the country, cashless society, please do this, that\r\n\r\nand  the  other.  \"Don't write a cheque, use this.\"  But  the\r\n\r\nprice  signals  are the other way.  It is  free  to  write  a\r\n\r\ncheque.   The  cheque book does not cost  money.   So  people\r\n\r\nwrite  cheques.   It  costs the bank $2 to  clear  a  cheque.\r\n\r\nEventually,  it  costs  the  customer  $2  too.    Somewhere,\r\n\r\nindirectly, it is bundled into your charges, but you  do  not\r\n\r\nsee it.  So you do not recognise it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to move to a position where these costs are\r\n\r\nproperly  reflected  and  I think there  will  be  affordable\r\n\r\nalternatives when all these costs are reflected, because,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  Singapore  is  not an expensive country  in  which  to\r\n\r\nprovide banking services.  And then customers will choose and\r\n\r\nif  it  makes  sense to write a cheque because it  is  a  big\r\n\r\namount of money, you write a cheque and you send it over.  If\r\n\r\nit is $20 on your PUB bill, you may go to the ATM and pay, or\r\n\r\nyou  may  dial up and pay and that costs 10 cents instead  of\r\n\r\nhaving to queue up at the counter, which really is not just a\r\n\r\nmatter of whatever counter charge may or may not be, but  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  taking  a  bus to go there, spending  an  afternoon\r\n\r\nqueuing  up, paying and then coming back, all of which  means\r\n\r\ntime  to you and loss in production to the economy.  So these\r\n\r\nare  all  costs  which  have to be  reflected  and  then  the\r\n\r\ncustomers and business will be able to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> May I ask the DPM\r\n\r\nwhether  he  would ask MAS to use moral suasion to  tell  the\r\n\r\nbanks to look at the other way of charging, ie, to give  some\r\n\r\nsort  of  rebates  to  customers  who  use  their  lower-cost\r\n\r\nservices?   For example, payment through the Nets  electronic\r\n\r\nfunds transfer or through Giro.  Instead, right now they  are\r\n\r\nall  looking  at trying to charge or increase  fees  on  cash\r\n\r\npayments or counter services or cheque payments.

He sets up a control room with a big radio  set\r\n\r\nand then he monitors the convoy going to the bank drawing the\r\n\r\ncash,  coming back and then he posts guards and lines up  the\r\n\r\ntroops.   The  whole afternoon is spent paying people  money.\r\n\r\nWe  did  all  this because we had one armed  robbery  and  an\r\n\r\nofficer  died.

Let  me  try  to\r\n\r\nsummarise  the  main  issues  concerning  the  harbouring  of\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders.  They are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) why do we need to adopt a tough stance against\r\n\r\nharbouring;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) why is there a need for the mandatory jail penalty;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) why do we treat employers and harbourers in the\r\n\r\nsame way;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) why do we need the presumption clause and the due\r\n\r\ndiligence requirements;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) has there been adequate publicity on the due\r\n\r\ndiligence requirements; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) do the authorities exercise discretion when\r\n\r\nevaluating each individual case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Why adopt a tough stance against harbouring?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because the immigration offender problem remains\r\n\r\na   serious  one,  and  those  who  provide  shelter  to  the\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders contribute to it.  Despite flushing out\r\n\r\nmore than 12,000 immigration offenders in 1989 when amnesties\r\n\r\nwere  granted, after the Act was amended to provide for their\r\n\r\ncaning,  the  number  of immigration offenders  has  remained\r\n\r\nunacceptably  high.  The  number  of  immigration   offenders\r\n\r\narrested has increased steadily over the years.  In 1992, the\r\n\r\nnumber of immigration offenders arrested was about 6,000, but\r\n\r\nthis number peaked to about 23,000 in 1998.  Despite rigorous\r\n\r\nenforcement,  the  number of immigration  offenders  arrested\r\n\r\nlast  year  was still high, at about 17,000.  The  number  of\r\n\r\nemployers  and  harbourers arrested has also been  increasing\r\n\r\nover the years, reaching a high of 388 for employers and  306\r\n\r\nfor harbourers in 1999.  I have asked the Clerk of Parliament\r\n\r\nto  circulate to you the Table (Cols. 199 - 200) showing  the\r\n\r\narrest figures for the various groups\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000509/20000509-HA-0720199.htm\">Table - Number of Arrests from 1992 to 1999 (Cols. 199 - 200)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontributing to the immigration offender problem from 1992 to\r\n\r\n1999.   [Copies  of  document distributed to  hon.  Members.]\r\n\r\nMembers  can  see  for  themselves  the  seriousness  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immigration offenders' problem has almost tripled in\r\n\r\n1992  from  6,000 to about 17,000 last year.  The  number  of\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants has actually gone up almost 30 times, from\r\n\r\njust  382  in 1992 to 11,500 in 1999. Although the number  of\r\n\r\noverstayers   arrested  remains  at  about  5,000-6,000,   on\r\n\r\naverage, some years are a bit higher, but that is because  of\r\n\r\nthe visa requirement imposed on a number of nationalities who\r\n\r\nwant  to  come to Singapore.  Despite that, we have many  who\r\n\r\ncame  here  on social visit pass and overstayed in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThat  is  because many of them who come from  China  and  the\r\n\r\nIndian Continent can easily blend with our environment,  live\r\n\r\nin  our flats together with Singaporeans and therefore it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  detect  them unless  enforcement  actions  are\r\n\r\nstepped up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these immigration offenders pose a serious threat\r\n\r\nto  Singapore's safety and security. Indeed, Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  crimes committed by immigration  offenders.\r\n\r\nThey  are  not like the law-abiding foreign workers who  come\r\n\r\nhere through legal channels to work or stay in Singapore, few\r\n\r\nof  whom commit crimes.  In fact, in 1999, only about 11  out\r\n\r\nof  every 10,000 foreign workers commit crimes compared to 91\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  out  of  every 10,000.   Immigration  offenders\r\n\r\nwould  not hesitate to break our laws, having already  risked\r\n\r\nthe  penalties of mandatory caning and jail.  If they  cannot\r\n\r\nfind  a job in Singapore, they are likely to resort to crime.\r\n\r\nPolice's  experience has shown this to be so.  In 1998,  four\r\n\r\nunidentified  Indian  nationals,  believed  to   be   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants,  robbed and killed an elderly couple  who  rented\r\n\r\nout the master bedroom in their HDB flat to them.  Only about\r\n\r\ntwo  weeks ago, two PRC illegal immigrants were sentenced  to\r\n\r\nlife imprisonment for kidnapping a 14 year-old female student\r\n\r\nlast year.  There are other examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tackle the problem effectively, it is necessary to\r\n\r\ncome  down  hard  on all the parties who contribute  to  this\r\n\r\nproblem,  namely, the traffickers who smuggle in the  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants - the profits are very good, I think each of  them\r\n\r\nis  paid  about 80 to 100 ringgit for each illegal  immigrant\r\n\r\nthey  smuggle in - the illegal immigrants or the  overstayers\r\n\r\nthemselves, the person who employs them, and the  person  who\r\n\r\ngives  them shelter.  Apart from rigorous enforcement against\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders  and  traffickers,  we  must  make  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  for the immigration offenders to find  work  or  a\r\n\r\nplace  to stay in Singapore.  It has to be clear to all  that\r\n\r\nthe  employment  or harbouring of immigration  offenders  are\r\n\r\nserious  offences,  and  those who flout  the  law  would  be\r\n\r\nseverely dealt with.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Why Need Mandatory Penalty?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why do we need a mandatory penalty? It is to serve\r\n\r\nas a deterrent.  The mandatory jail penalty for employers and\r\n\r\nharbourers  is  not a new provision.  It was  introduced  way\r\n\r\nback  in  1984  when Mr Chua Sian Chin was the  Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nMinister.  In moving the amendment to the Immigration Act, he\r\n\r\nstressed  to  the House the seriousness of the  offence.   He\r\n\r\nsaid  that  by  offering  the  illegal  immigrants  and   the\r\n\r\noverstayers  shelter, the landlords were in fact  encouraging\r\n\r\nmore  foreigners to remain in Singapore illegally.   Mr  Chua\r\n\r\npointed  out  that  employers and harbourers  were  the  main\r\n\r\nsource  of the problem.  Parliament passed the amendment  and\r\n\r\nimposed  a  mandatory  minimum jail  term  of  6  months  for\r\n\r\nemployers  and harbourers of immigration offenders.   It  was\r\n\r\nmeant to ensure that the penalty is sufficiently deterrent so\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  not be worthwhile for anyone  to  employ  or\r\n\r\nharbour  immigration offenders.  Singapore is  not  the  only\r\n\r\ncountry  to  use  mandatory sentences as a deterrent.   Other\r\n\r\ncountries, such as the UK and US, also have them for offences\r\n\r\nthey deem severe enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, some Singaporeans felt that the mandatory jail\r\n\r\npenalty  was  not  enough.  After the  Government  introduced\r\n\r\nmandatory caning for immigration offenders and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  presumption clause against employers in January 1989,  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times editorial on 4th August 1989, titled \"Cane  the\r\n\r\nBosses  Too\",  made  the  case  that  strong  action  against\r\n\r\nemployers  of  immigration offenders should have  been  taken\r\n\r\nearlier.  I quote from the editorial:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... It (namely, the January 1989 amendments) introduced a\r\n\r\npresumption clause to make it easier to bring such  employers\r\n\r\nto  book.   But  it left the penalty for the  offence  itself\r\n\r\nunchanged.  Of course, there are those who might argue that a\r\n\r\nminimum  jail  term of 6 months plus a fine is stiff  enough.\r\n\r\nBut  is it?  In case readers have forgotten, that was the old\r\n\r\npenalty  for immigration offenders which was not sufficiently\r\n\r\neffective  deterrent.  Surely what is  sauce  for  the  goose\r\n\r\nshould  be  the  sauce for the gander.\"  [It  meant  that  we\r\n\r\nshould also cane the employers.]     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Straits Times editorial in August 1989 felt that it was\r\n\r\nunfortunate that the Government in January 1989 did not \"take\r\n\r\nthe  next logical step - that is, make the penalty for hiring\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders so painful that  few  employers  would\r\n\r\ndare  break the law\".  The Government eventually took a  more\r\n\r\ntargeted  approach, and introduced mandatory caning for  only\r\n\r\nthe  \"hardcore\" employers who employ more than 5  immigration\r\n\r\noffenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, the Sunday Times in another editorial on\r\n\r\n29th  October  1995 headlined, \"No jobs here  for  illegals\",\r\n\r\nsupported tough deterrent sentences against errant employers.\r\n\r\nThe editorial said, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The assurance that the Police will crack down hard on\r\n\r\nthose  who  employ illegal immigrants will be  received  with\r\n\r\nwidespread  relief.   In  the longer  term,  tough  deterrent\r\n\r\nmeasures  will  also  help to protect  foreign  workers  from\r\n\r\nexploitation, both by racketeers and unscrupulous employers.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, they are talking about the requirements for the main\r\n\r\ncontractors  to  comply  with due diligence  requirements  by\r\n\r\nboarding  up  the worksites.  That was the amendment  that  I\r\n\r\nmoved in 1995.  Indeed, the Government will continue to  come\r\n\r\ndown  hard  on  those  who  employ  or  provide  shelter   to\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Why Treat Employers and Harbourers the Same?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue, Sir, is why do we treat the employers\r\n\r\nand the harbourers the same?  Should employers and harbourers\r\n\r\nbe treated differently?  The answer should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclearly be \"no\", because both employers and harbourers  cause\r\n\r\nthe  same  damage to the State.  Both profit from  activities\r\n\r\nthat contribute to the immigration offender problem.  Without\r\n\r\nwork and a place to stay, immigration offenders will not find\r\n\r\nit   worthwhile,  indeed  extremely  difficult  to  stay   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  That is why both the Ministry of Home Affairs and\r\n\r\nthe  then Ministry of Labour had from day one in 1984 decided\r\n\r\nto  treat both employers and harbourers in the same way.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Home Affairs and the then Ministry of Labour  had\r\n\r\nissued a joint press statement to warn against harbouring  or\r\n\r\nemploying  immigration offenders.  The statement  highlighted\r\n\r\nthat  any  person  who  harbours or  employs  an  immigration\r\n\r\noffender  would  face  the  same penalty,  which  includes  a\r\n\r\nmandatory  minimum of 6 months' jail.  So  that  mandatory  6\r\n\r\nmonths'  jail  was  enacted then.  Employers  and  harbourers\r\n\r\ntherefore  must  be  treated  in  the  same  way  for  either\r\n\r\nemploying or giving shelter to immigration offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Why Need Presumption Clause and Due Diligence Requirements?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is why we need the presumption clause\r\n\r\nand  the  due diligence requirement.  The presumption  clause\r\n\r\nagainst  landlords  is also not new.  It has  been  in  place\r\n\r\nsince 1984.  Under the clause, a person who gives shelter  to\r\n\r\nan  immigration offender is presumed to know the  immigration\r\n\r\nstatus  of  the person he has given shelter to.   Why  is  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  have the presumption clause?   Because  it  is\r\n\r\nextremely  difficult, if not impossible, for the  prosecution\r\n\r\nto  prove  that  the landlord knows that  his  tenant  is  an\r\n\r\nimmigration offender, (unless, of course, he had told someone\r\n\r\nelse  who is prepared to testify in Court, or unless  he  had\r\n\r\nwritten it down somewhere).  Hence, this approach is based on\r\n\r\ncommon  sense, since the landlord is in the best position  to\r\n\r\nexplain  to  the  Court why, even though  his  tenant  is  an\r\n\r\nimmigration  offender, he nevertheless does not know  of  his\r\n\r\nillegal status.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite the earlier presumption clause provided\r\n\r\nfor in 1984, the prosecution still faced difficulties in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngetting  errant  landlords convicted.  These  landlords  were\r\n\r\nable to secure acquittals by arguing that they had checked  a\r\n\r\nphotocopy of the work permit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, Justice F.A. Chua, in relation to a harbouring\r\n\r\nappeal  case, said that the social policy of the  Immigration\r\n\r\nAct   \"would   not   be  achieved  if  mere  negligence   and\r\n\r\nrecklessness on the part of the accused to enquire about  the\r\n\r\nstatus of the illegal immigrant or overstayer, if he knows or\r\n\r\nhas  reason to believe that the person is a foreigner,  would\r\n\r\nbe sufficient to rebut the presumption of knowledge.\"  Later,\r\n\r\nin  another  appeal  case  in 1993, the  Chief  Justice  said\r\n\r\nclearly in his judgement that \"to allow an employer to  evade\r\n\r\nthe  section  by  shutting his eyes  to  the  immigration  or\r\n\r\nemployment status of his foreign employee, would make  proper\r\n\r\ncontrol and enforcement impossible.  It cannot be placing too\r\n\r\nonerous a duty upon employers in Singapore to require them to\r\n\r\nscreen  their foreign workers before employing them to ensure\r\n\r\ncompliance  with immigration policy and the law.\"  Therefore,\r\n\r\nfrom  the outset, both the Courts and the Government were  in\r\n\r\nagreement that our immigration laws must not be defeated by a\r\n\r\nharbourer or employer simply making a claim that he  did  not\r\n\r\nknow  that  the tenant or worker was an illegal.  The  judges\r\n\r\nagreed  that  our  immigration  laws  should  be  interpreted\r\n\r\nstrictly  and that it was reasonable to impose some  form  of\r\n\r\nscreening on landlords and employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was why the Immigration Act was amended in 1993 to\r\n\r\nexpressly  require landlords to check the passport or  travel\r\n\r\ndocument of the foreigner he intends to employ or let out his\r\n\r\npremises to.  The Immigration Act was further amended in 1998\r\n\r\nto  update  and  state  clearly what  the  requirements  are,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  landlords are required to  check  the  original\r\n\r\nimmigration  or  work passes, check that the  particulars  on\r\n\r\nthese   passes  correspond  with  the  particulars   in   the\r\n\r\npassports,  and  if the employers are named, check  with  the\r\n\r\nemployer  to verify that his prospective tenants  are  indeed\r\n\r\nemployed by them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThese  checks  help  to  ensure that the  foreign  tenant  is\r\n\r\nlegally  in  Singapore, either on a valid work permit,  or  a\r\n\r\nvalid immigration pass.  Landlords are required to check  the\r\n\r\noriginal passes because it is easy to fake photocopies.   The\r\n\r\nchecks  against the passport and with the employer are  meant\r\n\r\nto  reduce the likelihood that the work permit or immigration\r\n\r\npass is a fake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These checks are straightforward. The setting out of\r\n\r\nthese  due  diligence requirements in fact helps  homeowners.\r\n\r\nThey  are informed exactly what they have to do to rebut  the\r\n\r\npresumption that they knew the illegal immigration status  of\r\n\r\ntheir  tenants.  It is also in the interest of homeowners  to\r\n\r\nconduct  the  checks.  It concerns not only  the  safety  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  the  community, but  also  their  own  personal\r\n\r\nsafety.    In  the  1998 case that I mentioned  earlier,  the\r\n\r\nelderly couple were murdered because they rented out  a  room\r\n\r\nto   suspected  illegal  immigrants.   This  would  not  have\r\n\r\nhappened if the couple had not taken them in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Has There Been Adequate Publicity?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question I want to address is: has there been\r\n\r\nadequate   publicity?    There  has.    The   due   diligence\r\n\r\nrequirements are stated clearly in the Immigration Act.  They\r\n\r\nhave been well publicised over the years - in the newspapers,\r\n\r\nover  the  radio  and television, through  Crime  Watch,  and\r\n\r\nthrough  SIR pamphlets.  In July 1998, HDB issued notices  to\r\n\r\nall flat owners and tenants who were eligible to sublet their\r\n\r\nrooms  to  warn  them  against letting out  accommodation  to\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders.  The notice  spelt  out  clearly  the\r\n\r\nchecks  that are required of the owners to conduct  to  avoid\r\n\r\nharbouring  immigration offenders.  These notices would  have\r\n\r\nreached more than 80% of all home owners in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also personally, in Parliament and on other\r\n\r\noccasions,   publicly  stressed  the   seriousness   of   the\r\n\r\nimmigration offender problem, and how landlords can  play  an\r\n\r\nimportant  part by denying them a place to stay.   The  media\r\n\r\nhas carried my comments.  In short, there has been a lot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  publicity on the seriousness of the immigration  offender\r\n\r\nsituation,  especially on our enforcement efforts and  severe\r\n\r\npenalties.  I am told that in the last few years,  there  was\r\n\r\non  average,  at  least  one report relating  to  immigration\r\n\r\noffenders  every month.  Some of these reports in  particular\r\n\r\nreminded  the public to be careful when employing or  renting\r\n\r\nout their premises to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government cannot ensure that every landlord knows\r\n\r\nthe  due  diligence requirements.  But it has done enough  to\r\n\r\npublicise them.  The problem really is that people  who  read\r\n\r\nthe  publicity or who have received the HDB notices  in  1998\r\n\r\ndid not care enough to take note, as, at that time, many felt\r\n\r\nthe matter did not concern them, since they were not planning\r\n\r\nto rent out their flats or rooms.  In fact, when SIR sent out\r\n\r\npamphlets recently to remind all households late last month - I  think  they sent to hundreds of thousands of households  -\r\n\r\nsome  homeowners  actually rang up SIR to complain  that  the\r\n\r\npamphlet  is  unnecessary and a waste of public money!   Some\r\n\r\neven  questioned whether SIR is suspecting them of harbouring\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders.  This shows that homeowners would  not\r\n\r\ncare unless the matter affects them personally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this consistent publicity backdrop, surely it is\r\n\r\nreasonable to expect landlords to be extra careful when  they\r\n\r\nlet out their premises to foreigners.  For landlords who have\r\n\r\nbeen  prosecuted, even if they did not fully comply with  the\r\n\r\ndue  diligence  requirements of the three  checks,  they  had\r\n\r\nfallen short.  They may look like decent people, like you and\r\n\r\nme.  But they were not \"innocent\", \"innocuous\" or \"unwitting\"\r\n\r\nlandlords as some people said.  Landlords know that they  are\r\n\r\ndealing  with foreign tenants.  Yet, many do not even  bother\r\n\r\nto  check their tenants' passports despite the widespread and\r\n\r\nregular  publicity  over  the  years  about  the  immigration\r\n\r\noffenders problem.  Some merely look at photocopies of  their\r\n\r\ntenants'  work  permits.  Others just leave the  checking  to\r\n\r\ntheir housing agents.  This is not good enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Are   There  Discretion  and  Guidelines  Supplied   by   the Prosecution?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the authorities have been meticulous in examining\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances and facts of every case, before a decision\r\n\r\nis  taken  as  to  whether to charge  a  landlord  in  court.\r\n\r\nInternal  guidelines to determine whether an offender  should\r\n\r\nbe  charged in court have been in place all the while.   Over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  the  guidelines have been fine-tuned  to  ensure\r\n\r\ntheir  relevance and effectiveness.  In the last  two  years,\r\n\r\nabout half of those arrested were not charged in court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo and Mr Noris Ong asked that we should have\r\n\r\nflexibility  and a different set of punishment for  offenders\r\n\r\nwho  have  broken the law unwittingly or due  to  negligence,\r\n\r\nsuch  as fines, that they should not be imprisoned.   I  have\r\n\r\nset  out  the  background to the various  amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nImmigration Act to show that the law cannot just  target  the\r\n\r\nknowing  or the intentional offender.  As it is difficult  to\r\n\r\nprove knowledge or intention, many landlords will be punished\r\n\r\nwith less strict penalties, such as fines.  If we were to  do\r\n\r\nthat,  then the problem of immigration offenders will not  be\r\n\r\nminimised as there would always be any number of \"first-time\"\r\n\r\noffenders.  This will embolden landlords to take risks,  thus\r\n\r\nundermining  our  comprehensive  approach  to  tackling   the\r\n\r\nproblem.   The nature and magnitude of our illegal offenders'\r\n\r\nproblem  justifies a tough approach.  As  the  law  has  been\r\n\r\nwidely  publicised over the years, landlords  should  not  be\r\n\r\nclaiming  ignorance  as an excuse, and  say  that  they  have\r\n\r\nbreached  the law unwittingly.  For landlords who  know  that\r\n\r\nharbouring of immigration offenders is an offence, their  act\r\n\r\nin breaking the law cannot be innocuous, because grave social\r\n\r\nharm  can  be  caused by their action.  Singaporeans'  safety\r\n\r\nwill  be jeopardized.  If a landlord knows the checks  he  is\r\n\r\nsupposed to conduct, but only does some cursory check, it  is\r\n\r\nthen  not a question of negligence.  Rather, he took the risk\r\n\r\nof  not conducting all the required checks.  The law is  very\r\n\r\nclear  -  a  landlord  is supposed to conduct  the  requisite\r\n\r\nchecks spelt out in the law.  For good reasons, the law  does\r\n\r\nnot require\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhim to have wilfully failed to conduct these checks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, with more than adequate publicity over the years,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no reason to make an exception for any  particular\r\n\r\ngroup, whether they be first-timers, retirees and so on.   If\r\n\r\nwe  let  first-timers off, the law would lose its  deterrence\r\n\r\nand effectiveness, as the vast majority of the harbourers are\r\n\r\nfirst-timers.   We  would  then have  an  even  more  serious\r\n\r\nimmigration offender problem on our hands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not the first Minister for Home Affairs to\r\n\r\ndeal  with this problem.  Mr Chua Sian Chin dealt with it  in\r\n\r\n1984,  Prof. Jayakumar dealt with it in 1989 and amended  the\r\n\r\nlaw  in 1993 to make it clear as to what landlords needed  to\r\n\r\ncheck.   Still that was not enough, and hence, I amended  the\r\n\r\nlaw  again  in  1998  to  state the  three  checks  that  the\r\n\r\nlandlords are required to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments to the Immigration Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Mr Goh Choon Kang asked if the Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  consider  requiring housing agents to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ntenants  they  introduce  to landlords  are  not  immigration\r\n\r\noffenders.   The  answer  is yes.  Amongst  others,  we  will\r\n\r\nconsider   extending  the  due  diligence   requirements   by\r\n\r\nlandlords to those who act as facilitators or middlemen, such\r\n\r\nas  housing agents, in the renting of premises to immigration\r\n\r\noffenders.   But this should not be construed as  a  move  to\r\n\r\nabsolve   the  landlords  of  their  responsibilities.    All\r\n\r\nlandlords  should  still personally check  the  documents  of\r\n\r\ntheir prospective tenants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome bona fide tourists to visit Singapore. We\r\n\r\nwelcome  foreigners  to  work  here.   But  we  cannot  allow\r\n\r\nforeigners  to  enter  or stay here  illegally.   No  country\r\n\r\nallows  that.  Neither can we adopt a casual attitude towards\r\n\r\nthose  who employ or harbour immigration offenders.  We  need\r\n\r\nto  be clear and consistent in our message and action that we\r\n\r\nare serious about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntackling the immigration offender problem comprehensively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landlords must play their part by diligently ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  they  do not give shelter to the immigration offenders.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not too late to start checking the immigration status\r\n\r\nof  their tenants.  By taking an active interest, they  would\r\n\r\nhelp  to  make Singapore a safer and more secure place.   And\r\n\r\nthis would also be in their own interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  tough policy on illegal immigrants and harbourers.\r\n\r\nBut  deterrence  is effective only if the  right  people  are\r\n\r\npunished.   I refer to the Minister's final point  concerning\r\n\r\nlandlords  and  agents.  Sir, when a landlord  relies  on  an\r\n\r\nagent  to perform the due diligence test and the agent  fails\r\n\r\nto  exercise due diligence, the landlord is punished instead.\r\n\r\nThat  seems to many people to be wrong.  I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister whether his Ministry would consider introducing\r\n\r\na  defence that would permit a landlord to show that  another\r\n\r\nparty  is  responsible  and that if  he  shows  this  to  the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  of  the  court, he,  the  landlord,  should  be\r\n\r\nexonerated  and  the agent punished.  In this  way,  criminal\r\n\r\nresponsibility is correctly placed.  This type of defence  is\r\n\r\nnot  new.  It can be found, for example, in section 93 of the\r\n\r\nFactories Act.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nsuch  a defence in this particular type of case because  much\r\n\r\nof the public annoyance seems to have come from the fact that\r\n\r\nthey thought that the landlords were unjustly punished.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I have explained, at great\r\n\r\nlength,  why the landlords are not unjustly punished if  they\r\n\r\ndid  not perform the due diligence requirements.  The law  is\r\n\r\nvery clear that they are required to take the three steps  to\r\n\r\ncheck  the  passports, the work passes and travel  documents,\r\n\r\nand  if necessary, check with the employers of those who  are\r\n\r\nworking here.  So they ought to know because of the publicity\r\n\r\nthat we have made over the years.  To allow landlords to make\r\n\r\na  defence to say somebody else has done the job for them  is\r\n\r\nnot enough because\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey just cannot pass the responsibility of renting a home to\r\n\r\nsomebody  else.   That  is  their  home,  they  have  primary\r\n\r\nresponsibility.   But I take the point that  there  could  be\r\n\r\nothers  who assist the landlord in renting out the  property.\r\n\r\nI  have  just  said that we will amend the law to  also  make\r\n\r\nthose  who facilitate such renting of premises liable, if  it\r\n\r\ncan be proven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the items of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  and  the remaining items on the Order  Paper  for\r\n\r\ntoday  be  exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions\r\n\r\nof Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HARBOURING OF IMMIGRATION OFFENDERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Home Affairs)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I will take up the point about duty. May\r\n\r\nI  ask  the Minister whether he feels that the landlords  and\r\n\r\nemployers  are in the same category because it  seems  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  a  person who may be a landlord for his home is not  in\r\n\r\nthe  business  of  renting  out  his  house.   There  may  be\r\n\r\ndifferences in education, background, knowledge and  language\r\n\r\nabilities.  The documents which the Minister referred to  may\r\n\r\nmany a time be in English, which are harder to understand for\r\n\r\nsome  people  from  foreign  countries.   Should  there   not\r\n\r\ntherefore  be a difference in the kind of duty we  impose  as\r\n\r\nbetween  an employer whose business is to have employees  and\r\n\r\nthe  landlord whose business may be otherwise?  Secondly, may\r\n\r\nI get the Minister's assurance that where a landlord has seen\r\n\r\nthe  original  documents, he will not face prosecution  where\r\n\r\nthese  documents are actually faked because  there  are  very\r\n\r\ngood  fakes  running around.  And, thirdly,  may  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister whether he will consider some sort of administrative\r\n\r\nprocedure  to  give assurance, a safe harbour  to  landlords,\r\n\r\nsuch  as, for example, whether the landlords and the  tenants\r\n\r\ncould go down with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  proper documents to a neighbourhood police post and have\r\n\r\nthe police witness the process of verification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, we have to treat both the\r\n\r\nemployers and the landlords in the same category because both\r\n\r\nfacilitate the stay of the legal immigrants in Singapore, one\r\n\r\nprovides  them  with  job,  the  other  provides  them   with\r\n\r\naccommodation.   No  doubt, there are people  with  different\r\n\r\nabilities, education background, etc, but it is their duty to\r\n\r\ngo  and get someone to help them to check these documents  if\r\n\r\nthey  themselves do not know.  Not knowing and not being able\r\n\r\nto  read  is not a defence in this law.  If the landlord  has\r\n\r\nchecked the document that is supposed to be original but,  in\r\n\r\nfact, it is a fake, then it would be a good defence for  him,\r\n\r\nif  he can argue that in court, and much depends on the facts\r\n\r\nof  the  case,  rather than for me to go and  speculate  what\r\n\r\nwould happen if that happens, and so on.  I cannot answer all\r\n\r\nthese  hypotheses.   Only  the  court  can  decide  based  on\r\n\r\navailable evidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the procedure to get the landlords and the tenants to\r\n\r\ngo to the NPP, I do not think it is necessary.  All they need\r\n\r\nto  do  is  to  look  at the documents,  check  the  original\r\n\r\npassport  and, if necessary, they can call up  SIR,  or  MOM,\r\n\r\nrather  than to create another layer in another place  to  do\r\n\r\nsuch a check.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> A follow-up question, Sir. Even though I\r\n\r\nmay  call up SIR and get the assurance that there is  such  a\r\n\r\nwork  permit, there is another step to see that the person  I\r\n\r\nam  renting to is actually the person named in the  document.\r\n\r\nCan  I  have  the  assurance of the Minister  that  if  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances prevail, the landlord would not be  prosecuted?\r\n\r\nSecondly, on a similar vein, the problem of the procedure  of\r\n\r\nletting  landlords know whether they are safe is a real  one.\r\n\r\nIf  we  are not careful, landlords can be very cautious about\r\n\r\neven  renting  premises to legal immigrants and  surely  that\r\n\r\nwill  send the wrong signal in our search for foreign  talent\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I do not think this law will deter\r\n\r\nlandlords  who  want  to  rent  their  properties  to   legal\r\n\r\nimmigrants\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause it is quite easy to determine a legal immigrant  from\r\n\r\nan  illegal  immigrant.

They  must\r\n\r\ncheck  the  original  copies.

But  that\r\n\r\ndocument  does not actually belong to that person who  is  in\r\n\r\nfront of me.

If\r\n\r\nhe  happens to be someone who has been here for a  while  and\r\n\r\nbefore  he  updates to a new pass, then do the logical  step,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  check with SIR or with MOM because  we  have  only\r\n\r\nstarted late last year to issue NRIC-type of work permits  to\r\n\r\nforeign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister how soon will the law be amended to include  housing\r\n\r\nagents.

But once he has performed the check and\r\n\r\nlater on if the tenant becomes illegal, for instance, because\r\n\r\nhis employer has cancelled his work pass, then that will be a\r\n\r\nfactor  that  the prosecution will consider in  not  charging\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Can I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether this checking process can be  made  through\r\n\r\nInternet, ie, the Ministry provides the database with all the\r\n\r\nwork  permit  passes so that the landlords can check  through\r\n\r\nthe Internet?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, in fact, the Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower  said  earlier on that this will be  made  available\r\n\r\nwithin  the next three months and SIR is also doing the  same\r\n\r\nthing  in collaboration with the Work Permit Department.   In\r\n\r\nthe  first  phase, they will put the names  and  the  Foreign\r\n\r\nIdentification  Number  (FIN)  and  other  details   on   the\r\n\r\nInternet,  and subsequently, they will put in the photographs\r\n\r\nas  well  because  it  requires some  time  to  prepare  this\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof Chin Tet Yung: Sir, I would like to come\r\n\r\nback  to  the  point  about  responsibility  of  agents   and\r\n\r\nlandlords.  If a landlord who is not well-educated decides to\r\n\r\ntrust  an  agent  and employs an agent specifically  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of checking the documentation and so on, would this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  be  sufficient  as  far as the  landlord  is  concerned?\r\n\r\nBecause  he  or she may not be very familiar with immigration\r\n\r\ndocuments but the housing agent professes to know a lot about\r\n\r\nthat  and is familiar with the checking processes and so  on.\r\n\r\nSurely,  it would not be right, at the same time, to  require\r\n\r\nthe  landlord  to go through the procedure once more  because\r\n\r\nafter  all,  he  or  she  is much less well-informed  as  the\r\n\r\nhousing agent and if the housing agent, who is professionally\r\n\r\nemployed  for  the  purpose,  says  that  it  is  valid   and\r\n\r\neverything  has  been  done and he can be  assured  that  the\r\n\r\nlabourer  is a legitimate immigrant to Singapore, why  should\r\n\r\nthe landlord be held accountable?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> It will be in the interest of the\r\n\r\nlandlord to see the documents himself.  For the agent,  right\r\n\r\nnow,  there is no law that makes the agent liable.   The  law\r\n\r\nrequires   the  landlord  to  perform  those  due   diligence\r\n\r\nrequirements.  Supposing the landlord gets the agent to check\r\n\r\nit  for  him, and in a number of such instances that I  read,\r\n\r\nthe agent then disappeared and the landlord could not produce\r\n\r\nhim,  then  there  would  be difficulties  in  assessing  the\r\n\r\nevidence.   As to whether eventually when we amend  the  law,\r\n\r\nand  hold  both parties liable or not, I have just said  that\r\n\r\nthis does not absolve the landlord from his liabilities.  But\r\n\r\nin  the  end,  the  Court will have to decide  based  on  the\r\n\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> I would like to ask the Minister a few\r\n\r\nquestions.   First,  I  would like to  say  that  I  have  no\r\n\r\nsympathy  for  people  who  exploit  illegal  immigrants   by\r\n\r\nharbouring  them, particularly employers.   But  there  is  a\r\n\r\ngroup of people who need an income and I am concerned about a\r\n\r\nlarge  number of older residents. The Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  permits the rental of one room or two rooms  by  these\r\n\r\nresidents and many of them are less educated.  And  going  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Manpower or Ministry of Home Affairs  is  a\r\n\r\ncumbersome process.  Many of them might find it difficult  to\r\n\r\nget  access. I think it is a serious problem and we  need  to\r\n\r\naddress  that.   Could  we work out a system  for  people  to\r\n\r\neasily verify the bona fide of those they are renting out to?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern that I have, and the Minister might\r\n\r\ncare  to  address, is that we are criminalising  a  group  of\r\n\r\npeople  who are, in a way, just renting out their  house  and\r\n\r\nwho   may  be  unwitting  at  some  point  because  of  these\r\n\r\ncumbersome  problems of trying to verify  the  bona  fide  of\r\n\r\nthese  people they are renting out to.  And to send  them  to\r\n\r\nimprisonment  is,  in  fact, a very  heavy  penalty.   I  was\r\n\r\nthinking whether there could be an option of either  a  heavy\r\n\r\nfine  or  imprisonment, if it is proved that they are  really\r\n\r\nharbouring  them, and also whether the Court could  be  given\r\n\r\nthe discretion to establish this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, for elderly residents who are really ignorant,\r\n\r\ncould  the  CDC  office or the Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nlevy  an  administrative charge on these people who  need  to\r\n\r\nrent  out,  particularly  older residents,  and  provide  the\r\n\r\nservice   to  establish  the  verification  of  the  tenants'\r\n\r\nbackground?   The respective Departments can  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs or the Ministry  of  Manpower  to\r\n\r\nestablish the background of these people they are renting out\r\n\r\nto.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the thrust of Dr Vasoo's\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  let us pass the responsibility  of  all  these\r\n\r\nchecks to somebody else and get the HDB or whoever to levy  a\r\n\r\nfee.   They cannot pay the $2 DBS charge. I think if agencies\r\n\r\nlevy  a fee, we are going to have a lot of trouble with these\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I have said, this is a serious point. No\r\n\r\nlandlord can disclaim responsibility. The law is very  clear,\r\n\r\nregardless of whether he may be less educated, poor or needy.\r\n\r\nBeing  poor  does not mean that he can be exempted  from  the\r\n\r\nlaw. Our laws must be applied to everyone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave a long answer just now as to why there is no such\r\n\r\nthing  as  an  unwitting  offender.   The  Member  said   the\r\n\r\nprocedure is cumbersome and, therefore, the landlord did  not\r\n\r\nwant  to check.  Then he is not unwitting.  He is a party  to\r\n\r\nit to allow this to happen.  On the system to verify, I think\r\n\r\nthe easiest thing is to look at the documents himself.  If he\r\n\r\ndoes  not know how to check, ask his neighbour.  That is  the\r\n\r\nsimplest thing to do.  Or he can make a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nphone call to SIR or MOM.  He can still call and verify.  But\r\n\r\nat  the  same time, he must ask for the piece of  paper  that\r\n\r\nsupports  this  verification from SIR or MOM.   Do  not  just\r\n\r\ndepend  on the phone call and later on say that he  did  call\r\n\r\nand  there was no evidence of that.  Primarily, the  landlord\r\n\r\nis responsible regardless of his social status.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Is the Minister aware that to just get\r\n\r\nthrough  to  the  Ministry of Home Affairs  and  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower is a tremendous effort?  I have tried sometimes  but\r\n\r\nI  had  great difficulty in getting through.  How about those\r\n\r\nwho  are  less educated who cannot get through?  And if  they\r\n\r\nget  through, how are they going to verify?  Who is going  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate that they have in fact checked?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Minister for Manpower has\r\n\r\njust  told me that it is not a fair statement to make because\r\n\r\nhe  himself called his own office, MOM's Work Permit  Office,\r\n\r\nand  he  could get through and he found the girl very  polite\r\n\r\nand  very  helpful.   Of course, we must bear  in  mind  that\r\n\r\npeople do not just call SIR to check on the particulars of  a\r\n\r\nforeigner.   People  call  SIR for all  kinds  of  enquiries,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  about passport, immigration pass,  permanent\r\n\r\nresidence  status,  social visit status,  visas  and  so  on.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are many phone lines, during the peak periods,\r\n\r\nthey  can  be all occupied.  If they cannot get through,  try\r\n\r\nagain.   And if they still cannot get through, it  is  not  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  thing  to go to SIR. SIR has such  a  nice  office\r\n\r\nenvironment,  very  friendly and all the signposts  are  very\r\n\r\nclear  on  how to get to a particular place, and it is  right\r\n\r\nnext  to an MRT station.  If Dr Vasoo says that these  places\r\n\r\nare   not  accessible,  I  would  not  accept  that,  because\r\n\r\nSingapore is a very small place.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I have two questions. Firstly,\r\n\r\nin   a  situation  where  the  landlord  has  exercised   due\r\n\r\ndiligence,   verified  the  documents  of  his  tenant,   but\r\n\r\nsubsequently,  the  tenant might bring his  friend  into  the\r\n\r\nhouse  to  stay with him or sublet it without the  landlord's\r\n\r\nnotice,   will   the   landlord  be  prosecuted   under   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister explained just now why there is a\r\n\r\nneed   for  mandatory  sentence  to  deter  would-be  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants.   But looking at the statistics, it seems  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not  really effective even with  the  mandatory\r\n\r\nsentence.   I  wonder  why  we want  to  impose  a  mandatory\r\n\r\nsentence  rather than allowing the Court to decide  based  on\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances. Can we not trust the Court to  decide  on\r\n\r\nthe  different situations?  I think the Court will know  what\r\n\r\nis  the  policy  of  the Government.  If it  is  really  that\r\n\r\nserious to deter illegal immigrants, I believe the Court will\r\n\r\nimpose the necessary punishment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I cannot answer Mr Low's first\r\n\r\nquestion directly whether or not the landlord will be  liable\r\n\r\nwhen  the  tenant brings in an illegal immigrant and  lets  a\r\n\r\nroom  out  to  him.   Much  turns on the  facts  whether  the\r\n\r\nlandlord  is aware of this taking place and turning  a  blind\r\n\r\neye  to  it.   Because if the landlord turns up and  collects\r\n\r\nrent,  and  he  rents it out to two persons and regularly  he\r\n\r\nsees  many other people living there, then he has reasons  to\r\n\r\nsuspect.   In  fact, he should question his  tenant  who  are\r\n\r\nthese  people,  how  long they have been  there,  etc.   Much\r\n\r\ndepends on the evidence available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low said that the law is not effective even with\r\n\r\nmandatory sentence.  I do not agree with that. Does  he  mean\r\n\r\nto  say  that  the law is not deterrent enough  and  the  six\r\n\r\nmonths'  jail is not enough?  Is he suggesting that?  Already\r\n\r\nwith  the minimum six months' jail, everyone is talking about\r\n\r\nthis  being too harsh.  Supposing we raise it higher,  people\r\n\r\nwill  feel  great pain.  I do not think that is the  problem.\r\n\r\nThe  point  is that for the illegal immigrants, Singapore  is\r\n\r\nsuch  an  attractive place.  We have economic growth  whereas\r\n\r\nmany  countries where they come from do not have  employment,\r\n\r\nor maybe if they have, the pay is not as good as Singapore's.\r\n\r\nAnd  they find it attractive to come here, even to the extent\r\n\r\nof  borrowing  money,  thousands of  dollars,  pawning  their\r\n\r\njewellery or whatever, and selling their homes and so on,  to\r\n\r\ncome  here  because they think they can make a better  living\r\n\r\nhere, earn,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsave  and bring home the money.  It is a great attraction  to\r\n\r\ncome  and  work  in  Singapore.  For the  landlords  and  the\r\n\r\nharbourers,  as  I have said, the due diligence  requirements\r\n\r\nwere  not  as  clearly  spelt out as  in  1998.   So  despite\r\n\r\nprosecution  efforts,  many of the harbourers  and  employers\r\n\r\nmanaged to get off.  But now with stricter enforcement by the\r\n\r\nPolice  and  SIR,  we see a larger number of  harbourers  and\r\n\r\nemployers  being arrested in the last three years.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  we found the situation untenable.  With so  many  of\r\n\r\nthem coming into Singapore illegally and if our landlords and\r\n\r\nemployers continue to harbour and employ them, then  we  must\r\n\r\ntake tough action.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, as regards landlords, the\r\n\r\nlandlord  does  not  know  and  has  no  knowledge   of   the\r\n\r\nsubletting.   On the question of deterrence,  if  the  court,\r\n\r\neven  without mandatory sentence in the legislation, were  to\r\n\r\nimpose very heavy penalty, is that not deterrent enough?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the minimum sentence stated in\r\n\r\nthe  legislation is to give the court an idea of what is  the\r\n\r\nminimum we expect of the sentence.  That is why we have it in\r\n\r\nthe legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned that the\r\n\r\nlaw  will  be reviewed.  Can I suggest that in reviewing  the\r\n\r\nlaw,  maybe  we  want to consider passing  the  onus  on  the\r\n\r\neligibility to rent a room or a house back to the tenant,  or\r\n\r\nto   the  employer?   And  to  implement  a  system  like   a\r\n\r\ncertificate  of eligibility where MOM or SIR actually  issues\r\n\r\nfor  potential  tenants  a  certificate  of  eligibility  for\r\n\r\nforeigners,  and  a way to cross check travel  documents.   I\r\n\r\nthink,  in  this way, we probably pass back the onus  to  the\r\n\r\ntenant.   We  separate  the  landlords  from  employers   who\r\n\r\nactually employ illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> What Mr Singh is suggesting is that we\r\n\r\nadd  another  layer for the landlord to check the certificate\r\n\r\nof  eligibility.  Already with three checks, he  cannot  make\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, we will cut the three checks to\r\n\r\njust  one  check, ie, the certificate of eligibility,   maybe\r\n\r\nthe  certificate against the passport.  I think that  is  all\r\n\r\nthat needs to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think it cannot be done because if a\r\n\r\nwork permit can be forged, an eligibility certificate will be\r\n\r\nmore easily forged.  So it is better that a landlord looks at\r\n\r\nthe  original  documents, ie, passport, work passes  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,   call the employer and the SIR or MOM.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is a safer bet for him than to create another layer  of\r\n\r\nbureaucracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, further to Mr Inderjit Singh's\r\n\r\npoint, I think what he meant was that if we have a system  to\r\n\r\nallow  a  person  to  go to the Internet and  do  an  on-line\r\n\r\nsearch,  one  can  actually download the information  of  the\r\n\r\nperson  being  checked.  That information is on the  computer\r\n\r\nand you can have a print-out.  And that will be the basis for\r\n\r\nproof  or  evidence that you have done the necessary  checks.\r\n\r\nProbably this can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, that is one piece of paper\r\n\r\nshowing  that he has checked with SIR or MOM.  There are  two\r\n\r\nother  checks. He has got to look at the person's pass,  look\r\n\r\nat  him,  look  at his passport, and compare the particulars.\r\n\r\nIf  he  does not do that, it is not enough just to depend  on\r\n\r\nthat website print-out from SIR or MOM.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, the explanation by the Minister seems\r\n\r\nmore  cumbersome, in the sense that landlords have got to  do\r\n\r\nseveral checks.  What I would like to tell him is that  there\r\n\r\nare  cases  which are genuine.  These people, to  an  extent,\r\n\r\ncarried  out  these checks.  Having done this, there  is  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of getting some verification.  If they  cannot  get\r\n\r\nthat  verification because of the problems of getting  access\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministry, we are, in fact, punishing some  of  these\r\n\r\npeople  unnecessarily.   Could we  not  give  the  court  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion of imposing either a heavy fine or jail?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I have already said that there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no such discretion for imposing a fine, because  we\r\n\r\nneed  a mandatory jail sentence.  And even with the mandatory\r\n\r\njail sentence since 1984, we have not solved the problem.  So\r\n\r\nlet  us not try to find another way to give them a fine.   Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo  says  that the procedure is cumbersome.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Manpower  explained earlier, and I also reiterate  here,\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  quite simple to go to SIR.  Go to Lavender  MRT\r\n\r\nstation,  get  out there, go to SIR and get a print-out  from\r\n\r\nthem.   That is his check with SIR about that person whom  he\r\n\r\nis wanting to rent his properties to.  But he must also check\r\n\r\nhis  passport and work pass to make sure that it is the  same\r\n\r\nperson.  He cannot shift the responsibility to anybody.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, how does a person prove that he\r\n\r\nhas checked the passport and the original documents?  Does he\r\n\r\nneed  a witness in case the person turns out to be an illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrant?   The  witness can say,  \"Yes,  I  have  seen  him\r\n\r\nverifying.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, if he has looked at it, checked,\r\n\r\nconfirmed, etc, and he makes a copy for himself, then he  has\r\n\r\nperformed the due diligence requirement.  Eventually,  if  he\r\n\r\nis  still taken to court and the prosecution did not  believe\r\n\r\nhim,  then  the court will have to decide based on  available\r\n\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\neveryone  is  required, under the law, to report  an  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrant if he or she should encounter one?   Second,  if  a\r\n\r\nmedical doctor encounters an illegal immigrant patient, is he\r\n\r\nbound under the same ruling?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Immigration Act does not\r\n\r\nrequire  the  reporting  of  an  illegal  immigrant  by   any\r\n\r\nSingaporean  sighting  an  illegal  immigrant.   In  general,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans cannot tell the difference just by looking at  a\r\n\r\nperson.   They  have  to  look at his papers,  ie,  passport,\r\n\r\npasses  and  so  on  before they can determine  whether  that\r\n\r\nperson's stay here is legal or not.  So the Immigration\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAct  does  not  require reporting to be done.   But  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest that they do so for their own safety, if they know of\r\n\r\nany.   If  they  have people in the neighbourhood  whom  they\r\n\r\nsuspect  to be illegal immigrants, then they can give  SIR  a\r\n\r\ncall  or  make  a  police  report, and  they  will  do  quiet\r\n\r\ninvestigations.   Police will not just raid  the  place  just\r\n\r\nbecause somebody makes a phone call, and then the Police will\r\n\r\nbe  running  around  raiding  houses.   They  will  do  quiet\r\n\r\ninvestigations and after they have determined the facts, they\r\n\r\nwill do something about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for doctors, I think the doctors have their own code\r\n\r\nof practice, and it is for them to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I just want to follow up again because I\r\n\r\nhave  quite  a lot of elderly residents who do rent  out  one\r\n\r\nroom  of their flats from time to time.

Of course, if  we\r\n\r\nadd  the  overstayers, it will be about 32,000.  Compared  to\r\n\r\nthe  number  of foreigners here, this is a small  percentage.\r\n\r\nBut, in absolute numbers, this is quite large because, at the\r\n\r\nmoment,  there  are 28,000 illegal immigrants  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnd  even  if  two of them stay in one household,  there  are\r\n\r\n14,000 households at risk at the moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  is  quite  serious to landlords and  people  who  allow\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants to stay here.

Of course, they\r\n\r\ncame  in legally but overstayed, and then they became illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants.

As I have said, Sir, our checkpoints are very\r\n\r\nsafe,  but  every  day illegals attempt  to  come  in  either\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Woodlands or Tuas Checkpoints.   They  hide  in\r\n\r\nlorries,   modified   cars   with   compartments,   in    the\r\n\r\nundercarriage,  behind the seats and so on.   There  are  all\r\n\r\nkinds   of  ways  and  means  for  these  people  to  smuggle\r\n\r\nthemselves  in,  because  it  is  quite  lucrative  for   the\r\n\r\ntraffickers to bring illegal immigrants into Singapore.  I am\r\n\r\ntold  that  for  every person they bring in,  they  can  make\r\n\r\nbetween  80 - 100 ringgit.  If they smuggle three  each  time\r\n\r\nand two runs a day, they will be quite rich.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that way, the illegals also try to come in by\r\n\r\nboats.   They  take  a speedboat and rush  through  our  very\r\n\r\nnarrow  waters between Malaysia and Singapore, and  in  three\r\n\r\nminutes they are there before the PCG could even reach  them.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why we have deployed more than 50 boats every day\r\n\r\nto deal with these people who come in by boats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POLITICAL DONATIONS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to regulate donations to political parties and\r\n\r\npolitical associations and to candidates and election  agents\r\n\r\nin a parliamentary election or presidential election so as to\r\n\r\nprohibit  foreign donations and restrict anonymous  donations\r\n\r\nthereto  and  for matters connected therewith,  and  to  make\r\n\r\nrelated   amendments  to  the  Parliamentary  Elections   Act\r\n\r\n(Chapter   218   of  the  1999  Revised  Edition)   and   the\r\n\r\nPresidential Elections Act (Chapter 240A of the 1999  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresented  by  the  Minister for Home Affairs  (Mr  Wong  Kan\r\n\r\nSeng); read the First time;  to be read a Second time on  the\r\n\r\nnext available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Housing and Development Act (Chapter 129\r\n\r\nof the 1997 Revised Edition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresented  by the Minister for National Development  (Mr  Mah\r\n\r\nBow  Tan); read the First time;  to be read a Second time  on\r\n\r\nthe next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING AND PYRAMID SELLING</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(PROHIBITION) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.14 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be\r\n\r\nnow read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House aims to bring the Multi-level Marketing and Selling (Prohibition) Act up to date and,\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time, make it more responsive  to  changes  in\r\n\r\ntechnology and the business environment.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Act was first enacted in 1973. The purpose\r\n\r\nof  the  Act  is  to prohibit the objectionable  features  of\r\n\r\npyramid  selling.   These are schemes where participants  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to pay a lump sum upfront to join, but the  driving\r\n\r\nforce to recoup their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nupfront  payment is the recruitment of more and more members,\r\n\r\nas  opposed  to  the  selling of  more  and  more  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices.   To illustrate, members of the House  will  recall\r\n\r\nthe  recent S888.com case, where participants pay $27,000  to\r\n\r\njoin  the  scheme, and receive a fixed commission  of  $3,000\r\n\r\nfrom  S888  for every additional member they recruited.  This\r\n\r\nright  to receive the commission subsists down to five levels\r\n\r\nfor each participant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such schemes will ultimately collapse, because the\r\n\r\nsupply  of willing recruits will run out.  When that happens,\r\n\r\nmany participants will lose their upfront payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Act needs to be updated, Sir. The\r\n\r\ndefinition  in the Act on multi-level marketing  and  pyramid\r\n\r\nselling  is too narrow.  The penalty provided for  under  the\r\n\r\nAct is inadequate.  In coming up with the Amendment Bill, the\r\n\r\nMinistry has consulted relevant industry parties and  studied\r\n\r\nrelevant  trends  overseas.   Parties consulted  include  the\r\n\r\nDirect Selling Association of Singapore (DSAS), the Consumers\r\n\r\nAssociation  of Singapore (CASE), the Monetary  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore (MAS) for inputs on the insurance industry and  the\r\n\r\nTrade  Development  Board  (TDB) for  inputs  on  franchising\r\n\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now go through some of the amendments. The\r\n\r\nthrust of the amendment in clause 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c)  is  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  general  definition  of  multi-level  marketing  and\r\n\r\npyramid selling in the Act.  This would remove the rigidities\r\n\r\nin  the  current legislation, such as a participant  must  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  share his commission with another  participant,\r\n\r\nbefore the scheme is deemed as pyramid selling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, clause 2(d) of the Bill will allow the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  exclude,  by  order,  legitimate  schemes   and\r\n\r\narrangements from the ambit of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 6 provide for the increase of the maximum\r\n\r\nfines  prescribed for the offences from $30,000 to  $200,000.\r\n\r\nClause  7  introduced a mechanism whereby a  court  needs  to\r\n\r\nimpose a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npenalty  in addition to any fine and/or imprisonment  ordered\r\n\r\nas  punishment for an offence committed under section 3(2) of\r\n\r\nthe Act.   The amount of the penalty takes into consideration\r\n\r\nthe  amount of profit made by the promoter or participant  of\r\n\r\nan  illegal  pyramid scheme and caters for a situation  where\r\n\r\nthe  maximum of $200,000 fine would manifestly be inadequate.\r\n\r\nThis  is  critical  to  ensure that  the  Act  serves  as  an\r\n\r\neffective  deterrent  to potential offenders.   The  proposed\r\n\r\namendment will make our legislation more responsive in acting\r\n\r\nagainst   pyramid  schemes.   At  the  same  time,  to   give\r\n\r\nassurances  to  legitimate  businesses  that  they  are   not\r\n\r\nunwittingly  caught by the Act, the Ministry has crafted  the\r\n\r\nfirst Exemption Order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businesses to be exempted under the first Order are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) insurance businesses registered or approved by MAS\r\n\r\nunder the Insurance Act and the Insurance Intermediaries Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) master franchise schemes which satisfy stated\r\n\r\nconditions;  and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) direct selling schemes which satisfy the following\r\n\r\nconditions will also be exempted from the Act:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the benefit received by any promoter or\r\n\r\nparticipant   is as a result of the sale, lease,  licence  or\r\n\r\nother distribution of a commodity  and not as a result of the\r\n\r\nrecruitment of additional participants;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the promoter of the scheme shall not knowingly\r\n\r\nmake  false or misleading representation or omission relating\r\n\r\nto the scheme or the commodity;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the promoter shall not make any representation on\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  of  the  scheme other than  the  sale,  lease,\r\n\r\nlicence or other distribution of a commodity; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there should be a clearly stated policy on\r\n\r\nrefund or buy-back guarantee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order will come into effect on the same date as the\r\n\r\nnew Act. At the same time, we will also take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  transfer  the  Act from the Ministry of  Finance  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Trade and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIndustry, as the Act deals mainly with trade transactions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House today reflects the\r\n\r\ndetermination  of  the Government to act  against  fraudulent\r\n\r\nschemes  in  the market.   Our legislation is, by and  large,\r\n\r\nadequate  in  this area.  Where necessary,  we  will  improve\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE has informed the House earlier that they will be\r\n\r\nputting  up  a proposal for a Fair Trading Act for Singapore.\r\n\r\nCASE  is currently studying the Fair Trading Acts adopted  by\r\n\r\ncountries  such as Australia and New Zealand. MTI will  study\r\n\r\nCASE's  proposal when it is ready.  We will, of course,  have\r\n\r\nto bear in mind the principles of minimal intervention to the\r\n\r\nmarket  and caveat emptor.   If we do over-regulate,  we  may\r\n\r\nstifle  innovation and push up compliance cost for businesses\r\n\r\nwhich  would  eventually  be borne  by  consumers.   We  must\r\n\r\ntherefore  weigh the pros and cons.  Ultimately, the  key  is\r\n\r\nfor the Government to promote competition in the market place\r\n\r\nand for consumers to stay alert and not be exploited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto speak in support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister of State has explained, the Bill is\r\n\r\nmeant  to  enable the Government to prohibit pyramid  selling\r\n\r\nschemes under a wider form of definition.  This is to protect\r\n\r\nunsuspecting persons from being recruited or made use  of  by\r\n\r\nundesirable pyramid selling promoters.  I also agree with the\r\n\r\nchange  of the maximum fines from $30,000 to $200,000 as  the\r\n\r\nvalue of the benefit from such schemes has escalated over the\r\n\r\nyears.  Therefore, a higher limit of fine is needed to act as\r\n\r\na more effective deterrent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I support this Bill, I would like to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity to pose a few issues to the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first query is to ask the Minister what form of\r\n\r\nprotection  or  control  can his  Ministry  exercise  if  the\r\n\r\npyramid selling\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscheme  is  perpetuated through the Internet.  If a syndicate\r\n\r\noperates  from  another country and  uses  the  Net  to  sell\r\n\r\npyramid  selling schemes in Singapore, how are  we  going  to\r\n\r\ntake  such  overseas operators to task?  With more  and  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans being wired up through the Internet,  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices  can  now  be  easily transacted  through  the  Net,\r\n\r\nwithout  the  promoters themselves of  such  pyramid  selling\r\n\r\nschemes being physically present in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue I would like to pose to the\r\n\r\nMinister is whether his Ministry has plans to look into  some\r\n\r\nform   of  competition  law  or  anti-trust  law.   In   some\r\n\r\ncountries,   there   are  laws  that  prohibit   monopolistic\r\n\r\npractices,   or  unfair  competition  or  unfair  competitive\r\n\r\npractices.   For  example,  if a  certain  group  manages  to\r\n\r\nmonopolise or corner a specific product or service, then they\r\n\r\ncan  manipulate  the market or charge unfair  prices.   Under\r\n\r\nsuch circumstances, the consumers will suffer.  This form  of\r\n\r\nundesirable  trading practices is no different  from  pyramid\r\n\r\nselling  schemes  as  ultimately  the  end-users  are   taken\r\n\r\nadvantage of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister kindly enlighten the House on the above\r\n\r\nissues?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, even as I rise to support the\r\n\r\nintent  of  the amendments, I am mindful of the proliferation\r\n\r\nof  trading and marketing arrangements in cyberspace  in  all\r\n\r\nform  and  manner  beyond the now conventional  B2B  and  B2C\r\n\r\nrelationships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, and against clause 2, which seeks to\r\n\r\nbroaden  and  simplify  the definition  of  \"pyramid  selling\r\n\r\nscheme   or   arrangement\",  the   incidence   of   unwitting\r\n\r\nparticipation  could in fact be raised.   This  really  boils\r\n\r\ndown to ignorance of the technical definition on the part  of\r\n\r\nan increasingly Net-savvy population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Government's philosophy of not over-regulating. However, I believe there is plenty of room for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nguidance,  counsel  and  clarification  for  the  man-in-the-street.  Let me explain the challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Online retailing and marketing schemes emanating offshore</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague, Mr Leong, has alluded to, this poses a\r\n\r\nchallenge.  I believe many Singaporeans have e-mail  accounts\r\n\r\noffered  outside Singapore and are frequently presented  with\r\n\r\nspecial  deals.  When a Singaporean participates  in  such  a\r\n\r\nscheme,  it seems straightforward enough.  He is a  wise  and\r\n\r\nprudent shopper.  Suppose he is asked to email as many of his\r\n\r\nfriends  as possible to urge them to join this shopping  club\r\n\r\nfor a small fee so as to take advantage of this privilege  as\r\n\r\nwell.  In return for his effort, he gets credits which he can\r\n\r\nutilise  to secure other goods and services.  And the  scheme\r\n\r\ngoes on with more recruitment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would this now be considered as pyramid selling?\r\n\r\nThis  is  not  your typical get-rich-quick  scheme  with  its\r\n\r\ntelltale \"make some easy money\" carrot.  Given the fact  that\r\n\r\nmany  of  these  schemes  are truly globalised  and  somewhat\r\n\r\noutside the jurisdiction of Singapore, how would such schemes\r\n\r\nand perpetrators be treated?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Need for public education</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it is not clear cut, can Singaporeans get access\r\n\r\nto  some counsel and advice?  These efforts can be Government\r\n\r\ndriven  or  supported.  For example, the US Postal Inspection\r\n\r\nService has posted on its website, a simple test of a  scheme\r\n\r\nwhether  the basis of the promotion is the sale of a  product\r\n\r\nat  the  retail level, or an emphasis on recruiting more  and\r\n\r\nmore distributors to help one increase one's income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful\r\n\r\ntips on its website, along with toll-free lines for consumers\r\n\r\nto  file complaints, and publishes brochures as well on these\r\n\r\nand other consumer matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in future, the Internet is likely to be the theatre\r\n\r\nwhere the greatest selling scams will be played out, and home\r\n\r\nto  various pyramid schemes.  Given this inevitable  scenario\r\n\r\nand the limitations to bring such perpetrators to justice, it\r\n\r\nwould  appear  that consumer awareness is one of  the  better\r\n\r\ndefences.   Towards  this  end, I  would  like  to  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to devote more resources for public education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Mr Leong\r\n\r\nHorn  Kee and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua for their comments and support\r\n\r\nfor the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked\r\n\r\nwhat  if  the pyramid selling scheme originates from overseas\r\n\r\nvia the Internet. The first question is whether this will  be\r\n\r\ncovered  under  the  law.  Sir, if a pyramid  selling  scheme\r\n\r\noriginates  from a foreign jurisdiction, the  Act  would  not\r\n\r\napply  to affected persons and activities occurring overseas.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  a Singaporean takes part in such a  scheme  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently tries to perpetuate the scheme within Singapore,\r\n\r\nthen our law would apply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I would like to respond to Mrs Lim Hwee\r\n\r\nHua's  second  point, ie, is there a danger that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmay  unwittingly  take part in such a scheme that  originates\r\n\r\nfrom  overseas.   Sir, if Singaporeans take part  in  such  a\r\n\r\nscheme  and perpetuate the scheme in Singapore, they will  be\r\n\r\ncovered under the law.  Therefore, it is very important  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are fully aware of such a law and  do  not  get\r\n\r\nthemselves involved in such a scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, following the passage of the law in this\r\n\r\nHouse  today,  the  media and the consumer group  would  play\r\n\r\ntheir part in helping to create public awareness.  I want  to\r\n\r\nassure  both Members that even though the amended  law  would\r\n\r\ncover all forms of pyramid selling, as I have mentioned in my\r\n\r\nspeech  earlier,  the  Minister  can  provide  for  exemption\r\n\r\nthrough an order and the first Exemption Order will come into\r\n\r\neffect at the same\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntime  as the Act.  This means that for Singaporeans who  take\r\n\r\npart  in  any pyramid selling scheme, as long as  the  scheme\r\n\r\naims  to  generate benefit for the members  not  through  the\r\n\r\nrecruitment of additional members but through the selling  or\r\n\r\nleasing  of  more  commodities, as  provided  for  under  the\r\n\r\nExemption Order, they will be all right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee brought up a broader issue of\r\n\r\ncompetition law and anti-trust law.  His concern  is  whether\r\n\r\nsome  businesses  may  monopolise the  market  and  therefore\r\n\r\nintroduce  undesirable  selling tactics  which  could  be  as\r\n\r\nundesirable as the pyramid selling scheme.  Mr Leong's  point\r\n\r\nis  well  taken.   Over  time, with advances  in  technology,\r\n\r\ncompetition  will  get  keener and companies  are  likely  to\r\n\r\nintroduce more new ways of doing business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua also made the same point that besides\r\n\r\nB2C and C2C, there will be new business models.  This morning\r\n\r\nI  was  at  an  Internet conference and I  commented  to  the\r\n\r\nparticipants that in the past we used to talk about B2B, B2C,\r\n\r\nC2C.   Today,  companies are introducing  new  concepts,  for\r\n\r\nexample,   E2E   (end  to  end),  or  M2M   (marketplace   to\r\n\r\nmarketplace).   We  do  not know what kind  of  new  business\r\n\r\nmodels  will be introduced tomorrow.  But what I do  know  is\r\n\r\nthat  from  A2A  to Z2Z, there are 676 possible combinations.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  can all be rest assured that  in  the  coming\r\n\r\nmonths  and  years, many companies will be  thinking  of  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of  creative ideas in order to gain advantage  in  the\r\n\r\nmarketplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the part of the Government, we have basically\r\n\r\ntaken  three  types of measures.  The first measure  we  have\r\n\r\ntaken is to introduce competition in the marketplace so as to\r\n\r\nreduce the possibility of a monopoly situation.  We have done\r\n\r\nso  with the telecommunications market; the financial  market\r\n\r\nis  now being liberalised progressively; and my Minister  has\r\n\r\nannounced  the impending liberalisation for power generation,\r\n\r\nwater   desalination,   and  so  on   and   so   forth.    So\r\n\r\nliberalisation is the way to go to ensure that there will  be\r\n\r\nenough healthy competition in the marketplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as we liberalise our market, we are also\r\n\r\nintroducing  measures to regulate the healthy development  of\r\n\r\nvarious   sectors.   Take,  for  example,  in  the  area   of\r\n\r\ntelecommunications, we have IDA as the regulatory  authority.\r\n\r\nIf  any  business  or company wants to enter this  particular\r\n\r\nmarket, it will have to apply for licences and abide  by  the\r\n\r\nrules  of  the  industry.  This will hopefully  minimise  the\r\n\r\npossibility   of  undesirable  market  practices.    However,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the setting up of a regulatory  body,  it  is\r\n\r\ntrue that the marketplace may still see the emergence of some\r\n\r\nof these undesirable anti-competition measures.  For example,\r\n\r\nin   some  European  countries,  they  set  up  a  regulatory\r\n\r\nauthority,  the  NRA  (National  Regulatory  Authority),   to\r\n\r\nregulate various vertical sectors within each country.   And,\r\n\r\nat the same time, they have a National Competition Commission\r\n\r\nthat  will  look  into anti-competition measures  across  all\r\n\r\nsectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, over time, as we continue to\r\n\r\nliberalise  our  market,  as  we  continue  to  set  up  more\r\n\r\nregulatory bodies, I think it is also relevant for us to look\r\n\r\ninto  the need for the introduction of a competition  law  as\r\n\r\nwell as the need to set up a Competition Commission.  So  the\r\n\r\nMember  may  be pleased to hear that this is an area  MTI  is\r\n\r\nactively looking into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Lim Swee Say].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to Monday, 22nd May,\r\n\r\n2000.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-five minutes to Five o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to Monday, 22nd May, 2000.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OUTPATIENT CLINICS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment what is the average outpatient clinic to dwelling\r\n\r\nunit ratio in a Housing and Development Board estate and  why\r\n\r\nfor  a  new  town  such as Sengkang, with  more  than  20,000\r\n\r\ndwelling  units  completed to date, has only four  outpatient\r\n\r\nclinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is part of HDB's plan to provide sufficient amenities\r\n\r\nand  commercial facilities in the development  of  any  town.\r\n\r\nWhile  HDB  does  not  have an average outpatient  clinic  to\r\n\r\ndwelling  unit  ratio in the planning of new  town,  it  will\r\n\r\nensure  that there is a range of facilities such as  clinics,\r\n\r\neating  houses, markets, schools, etc. in every town to  meet\r\n\r\nthe needs of the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Sengkang Town, there will be 3 commercial centres to\r\n\r\nserve  residents living in the eastern part of the  town.

The increase in project cost of $81  million\r\n\r\nor  16%  was caused by inflation in construction cost, higher\r\n\r\ncosts   for  basement  construction  and  higher   costs   of\r\n\r\npreliminaries  for the complex works.

CPF members who have contributed to CPF throughout\r\n\r\ntheir  working life should accumulate enough savings to  meet\r\n\r\ntheir   basic   retirement,  healthcare  and  housing   needs\r\n\r\ncommensurate  with their incomes.  However, many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave higher expectations, especially if they wish to maintain\r\n\r\ntheir  present lifestyles after they retire. Then  their  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  alone  may  not be enough, and they  would  need  to\r\n\r\nmanage  their personal savings properly, to supplement  their\r\n\r\nCPF  balances.  As retail investors, they must learn to  look\r\n\r\nout  for  themselves, and be discerning in  choosing  from  a\r\n\r\ngrowing range of service providers and products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater efforts at investor education will be useful.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to equip investors with the basic tools to carry\r\n\r\nout informed financial investment decisions.  An NUS survey\r\n\r\ncommissioned by a bank last year showed that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nbelieve they have enough knowledge to manage their money, but\r\n\r\nmost of those surveyed lacked understanding of basic\r\n\r\nfinancial concepts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of the financial system as a\r\n\r\nwhole,  an informed investing public exerts market discipline\r\n\r\non  financial  institutions.   This  supports  our  long-term\r\n\r\nobjective of developing a more open and transparent financial\r\n\r\nsector, driven by fundamentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has a role in promoting public understanding of the\r\n\r\nbenefits and risks of financial products, but we do not think\r\n\r\nthat  the  regulator can carry the full burden  of  educating\r\n\r\ninvestors.    We   will  use  the  Internet  to   disseminate\r\n\r\ninformation  to  enhance consumer awareness,  and  will  also\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  support initiatives by trade bodies  in  public\r\n\r\neducation. For example, the Investment Management Association\r\n\r\nof Singapore (IMAS), as the representative body of investment\r\n\r\nmanagers,  has  established  an  Education  Sub-Committee  to\r\n\r\npromote  greater  public awareness about the fund  management\r\n\r\nindustry,  through  public seminars, talks  and  forums,  and\r\n\r\npublications.  Another  example is the  Securities  Investors\r\n\r\nAssociation   of  Singapore  (SIAS),  which  has   identified\r\n\r\ninvestor  education as a key activity and is working  closely\r\n\r\nwith several brokerages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board will continue with its retirement planning\r\n\r\nprogramme  called  \"Take  Charge.

If the sale is completed without incident,\r\n\r\nhe  will pay the money to the seller.  If the sale is aborted\r\n\r\nthrough  no  fault of the buyer, the stakeholder returns  the\r\n\r\nmoney to the buyer.  In the meantime, neither the seller  nor\r\n\r\nbuyer  can rightfully claim that the money, and the  interest\r\n\r\nearned  from it, belong to him as it is not certain who  will\r\n\r\nfinally   be   entitled  to  the  money.  Therefore,   in   a\r\n\r\nstakeholding  situation, it is not  meaningful  to  speak  of\r\n\r\n\"owner of the fund\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law allows stakeholders to retain the interest\r\n\r\nearned  on  the  stakeholding funds as remuneration  for  the\r\n\r\nvaluable service they provide to both seller and buyer.   The\r\n\r\nstakeholder,  who holds the money on behalf of both  parties,\r\n\r\nis  accountable to them for the safekeeping of the money.  He\r\n\r\nmust  act fairly as between the parties and pay out the money\r\n\r\nonly in accordance with law.  This is especially important in\r\n\r\ncases where there is a legal dispute between the parties  and\r\n\r\nthey  both lay claim to the money.  As he provides a  service\r\n\r\nwhich protects the interests of both buyer and seller, it  is\r\n\r\nonly fair that he is adequately remunerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should clarify that it is not only law firms who act\r\n\r\nas  stakeholders  in property transactions.

As early as 1985,  we\r\n\r\nimplemented the National AIDS Control Programme, even  before\r\n\r\nthe  first  case of HIV infection was detected.   The  multi-pronged   control   strategy  comprises   health   education,\r\n\r\nprotection  of  the  national blood supply,  counselling  and\r\n\r\nmanagement  of the infected and their contacts,  surveillance\r\n\r\nof  the disease, and the training of personnel.  With no cure\r\n\r\nor  vaccine for the disease, the main focus in the control of\r\n\r\nAIDS in Singapore continues to be on health education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st March 2000, a cumulative total of 1,194\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  been reported to be  HIV  infected  since\r\n\r\n1985.  Among them, there were 508 asymptomatic carriers,  283\r\n\r\nwith  full-blown AIDS and 403 have died.  Over the last  five\r\n\r\nyears,  the rise in the number of HIV infections in Singapore\r\n\r\nappears  to  be  slowing  down, with  the  rate  of  increase\r\n\r\ndeclining  from  29%  in 1994-1995 to 4%  in  1998-1999.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  will continue to monitor the situation  and  ensure\r\n\r\nthat all necessary and timely measures to control the disease\r\n\r\nare taken where appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV/AIDS patients have access to subsidised inpatient\r\n\r\nand  outpatient  care  like any other patient.   This  covers\r\n\r\nhospital   charges,  radiological  and  laboratory   charges,\r\n\r\ntreatment   of  complications  with  standard   drugs   where\r\n\r\nappropriate and consultation charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is no subsidy for anti-retroviral\r\n\r\ndrugs,  which are considered non-standard drugs. This  is  no\r\n\r\ndifferent  from all other non-standard drugs  used  to  treat\r\n\r\ncancers, hypertension, etc. which are also not subsidised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated monthly cost of \"Optimal\" therapy, which\r\n\r\ninvolves  the  use  of  3-drug combination  and  including  a\r\n\r\nprotease  inhibitor,  is between $1200  and  $1600.   A  less\r\n\r\nexpensive  therapy  with  2-drug combination  and  without  a\r\n\r\nprotease inhibitor would cost about $600 per month.  Patients\r\n\r\nare allowed to use $500 per month from their Medisave account\r\n\r\nfor  any of the anti-retroviral drugs that are registered  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment of HIV/AIDS is very expensive. It delays\r\n\r\nbut does not prevent the onset of AIDS. The effectiveness  of\r\n\r\nsuch therapy over the long term is still not known. Treatment\r\n\r\nwould  have  to be life-long as studies have shown  that  the\r\n\r\nvirus rebounds soon after treatment is halted. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nshould channel our available resources to more cost-effective\r\n\r\ntreatments for the benefit of the majority of patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV/AIDS patients who require further financial\r\n\r\nassistance  could  approach Action for AIDS  (AfA)  or  other\r\n\r\ncharitable organisations for help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SOCIAL WELFARE RECIPIENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Sports how many social  welfare  recipients\r\n\r\nreceive their monthly financial assistance via GIRO and which\r\n\r\nbank his Ministry uses to disburse the Government assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 1,620 Public Assistance recipients receive\r\n\r\ntheir monthly financial assistance via GIRO.

In the Upper Secondary Biology syllabus, the spread of\r\n\r\nHIV  and methods by which it may be controlled are discussed.\r\n\r\nThe Human and Social Biology syllabus elaborates on the signs\r\n\r\nand  symptoms  and causes of AIDS as well as its  spread  and\r\n\r\ncontrol.   AIDS is also taught in the Secondary 5 Civics  and\r\n\r\nMoral  Education  (CME) syllabus under  the  broad  theme  of\r\n\r\n\"Responsible  Dating\".  Pupils discuss  the  consequences  of\r\n\r\npremarital sex such as contracting STDs and AIDS.   Talks  on\r\n\r\nSTDs  and  AIDS  are also regularly conducted by  the  School\r\n\r\nHealth  Service  of  the  Ministry of  Health  to  pupils  in\r\n\r\nSecondary 3 and JC1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, MOE is developing a more holistic approach to\r\n\r\nsexuality  education, building on what is already covered  in\r\n\r\nthe  existing  curriculum and bearing in mind  the  different\r\n\r\nneeds   of  students  at  different  stages  of  growth   and\r\n\r\nadolescence.
