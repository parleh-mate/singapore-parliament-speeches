Assessments also provide important information about standards of performance for the individual and the system as a whole. Like all tools, assessments must be used judiciously. They are not an end in themselves but should be properly applied in the right circumstances with clear educational outcomes in mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summative assessments like term tests or year end examinations have their uses and at appropriate stages are used to measure pupil achievement for the purpose of grading, ranking or certification.&nbsp; But they do not provide essential information about specific areas that the pupil can&nbsp;improve in that would help him better learn the topic or subject. In this regard, formative assessments provide richer information that can be used by the teacher, pupils and parents to improve in specific areas. For example, for English compositions, teachers can use rubrics to provide feedback to pupils on specific areas such as presentation of ideas, grammar and vocabulary. Rubrics provide a structured way of giving qualitative feedback beyond just an overall mark.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both types of assessments should be used as tools to enable every pupil to reach his full potential but in the early years of education in lower primary, the <p align=left>Column: 1184<p>more important focus should be on formative assessment to build basic learning skills rather than summative assessments to rank pupils.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked if formative assessments would prepare pupils adequately for the PSLE. Formative assessments if used well can help accelerate pupils&rsquo; learning as they would identify specific skill sets or topics that the teacher could then focus on. We do need to train teachers in the application of formative assessments. Since July last year, MOE has partnered 16 schools to plan and prototype Holistic Assessment models and strategies at Primary 1 and Primary 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;This prototyping has enabled us to draw key learning points from the schools&rsquo; experiences as we expand to include more schools. MOE has plans for all primary schools to be trained in the use of formative assessments for Primary 1 and 2 levels by 2013.&nbsp; When schools are ready, they will move towards the use of topical tests and bite-sized performance tasks to check for understanding and mastery for Primary 1 and 2. Such use is appropriate because they are more effective tools to form basic learning skills compared to summative exams.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents will continue to receive marks and grades in these assessments. But beyond this, teachers will also provide qualitative feedback to the pupils and parents to highlight areas where pupils have done well, and also ways to improve pupils&rsquo; learning.&nbsp; In short, parents will be getting more and richer feedback about their children&rsquo;s learning.

There are in fact surplus places at the end of every Primary 1 Registration Exercise. Nevertheless, for popular schools which will always have more applications than places available, balloting is a fair means to determine admissions. The balloting situation this year is comparable to last year when MOE began the process of transition&nbsp;for primary schools to single sessions.&nbsp;Eighty schools or 45% of our primary schools conducted balloting in Phase 2C this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member asked for the number of admissions in priority schemes before Phase 2C.&nbsp; The Primary&nbsp;1 registration framework has very clear criteria which set out the priority for admissions. &nbsp;Donations by parents are not a consideration.&nbsp; Those admitted under the parent volunteer scheme in Phase 2B took up only 3% of all places available, or 1,337 places, spread across 77 schools.&nbsp; Overall, in this year&rsquo;s exercise, over 98% of the children secured a Primary 1 place in their first-choice school or a school within&nbsp;two kilometres of their home.&nbsp; MOE, therefore, has no plans to alter the current registration framework which has worked well to meet the diverse needs of the schools and the applicants.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If that is exhausted and there are still places available, then those between a one- and two-kilometre radius are given the option.&nbsp; If there are more applications than places, then there will be balloting.&nbsp; Beyond that, admission will be for those in the three-kilometre radius and further.&nbsp; That is a system that is fair.&nbsp; To guarantee someone who lives across from the school that he will definitely get admission to that school would unnecessarily constrain the system, because,&nbsp;really, a one-kilometre radius accords sufficient priority for the purpose of proximity to the school.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

A total of 115,900 PR applications were processed in 2009, of which 59,500 or 51% were successful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the tightening of the immigration criteria since the end of last year, the <p align=left>Column: 1189<p>number of PRs to be granted in 2010 will be noticeably less than that in 2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member also asked for the profile of those who were successful in their PR applications. Of those granted PR, the majority of them qualified under the Professional, Technical and Skilled Workers Scheme where they are contributing to Singapore's economy.&nbsp; Others who were granted PR are dependants of Singapore Citizens or are dependants of these economic PRs.&nbsp; We will continue to be stringent in our requirements for PR. PR will be granted to those of suitable quality, are able to contribute to Singapore and integrate well into our society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An inflow of immigrants helps to improve the old-age support ratio by increasing the number of economically active residents.&nbsp; Let me illustrate.&nbsp; In 1970, when our TFR was above the replacement rate of 2.1, each elderly person was supported by 17 working adults.&nbsp; Currently, we have about 8.2 working adults in the resident population supporting one elderly person.&nbsp; If there were no PRs, we would have slightly fewer adults, at 7.2 working adults supporting one elderly person.&nbsp; If we were to close our doors to immigrants tomorrow, we can expect the old-age support ratio to fall very fast.&nbsp; In short, we would still need immigration to make up for the shortfall of babies and help ease the pressure of an ageing population.&nbsp; We will carefully manage the numbers to ensure the&nbsp;quality of immigrants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, declining population is a long-term issue.&nbsp; It requires to be tackled well ahead, several decades ahead, of the problems manifesting themselves.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for National Development):</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) was implemented in 1989 to prevent the formation of racial enclaves and promote racial harmony in HDB housing estates.&nbsp; With the EIP, we ensure a good mix of residents of different races in&nbsp;different neighbourhoods and blocks of an HDB estate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The EIP limits are applied consistently across all ethnic groups, and are reviewed regularly to ensure that they remain relevant.&nbsp; Just recently, we increased the EIP limits for the \"Indian and Others\" category&nbsp;by 2% points, to address demographic changes.&nbsp; When the EIP limit for a particular ethnic group is not reached, there&nbsp;are no restrictions on the sale and purchase of an HDB resale flat.&nbsp; As at September 2010, 86% of 162 HDB neighbourhoods have not reached any EIP limits.&nbsp; In other words, potential flat sellers may face limitations in 14% of HDB neighbourhoods only.&nbsp;&nbsp; And even when the <p align=left>Column: 1197<p>EIP limit for a particular ethnic group is reached, sellers can still sell their flats to buyers from the same ethnic group, as it will not increase the ethnic group's proportion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resale flat transactions take place on a willing buyer-willing seller basis.&nbsp; The resale price is an outcome of the different attributes of the flat such as location, age, extent of renovation and the prevailing market conditions.&nbsp; EIP is not the only factor that affects the resale price.&nbsp; It is also difficult to attribute the resale price to any single factor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB does not&nbsp;take back flats from lessees who have completed the minimum occupation period for resale, as they may sell their flats in the open market.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are a large number of resale flat transactions in the open market, averaging about 30,000 units annually,&nbsp;in different locations, with a wide range of flat types and prices.&nbsp; Sellers who are affected by the EIP limits should have no problem finding buyers from the eligible ethnic groups as long as they are realistic in setting their asking price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Mr Viswa Sadasivan (Nominated Member):</B> I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his response.&nbsp;The reason&nbsp;I raised this question is because&nbsp;quite a few of my friends and their friends have highlighted that they have had difficulties selling their flats at market rates because of their ethnic background, especially because they are in the minority groups.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;wondering if this perception is pervasive on the ground.&nbsp; It does not&nbsp;augur well for&nbsp;the multi-cultural nature of our society, if people feel that they are disadvantaged as a result of their ethnic minority status.&nbsp;That is the concern with which I have raised this question.

Secondly, even if the flat is affected by EIP, it is difficult to&nbsp;attribute&nbsp;that EIP has affected&nbsp;the resale price as a single factor.&nbsp; If we look at the argument &ndash; that minorities may be affected by the EIP, and who sell their flats below market valuation, as the Member pointed out &ndash; the assumption is that if we take out the EIP component, they&nbsp;will be able to sell their flats at higher market rates.&nbsp;This is not necessarily the case because there are sellers who are not affected by the EIP restrictions, who are selling below market rates too.&nbsp; There are also sellers who are affected by EIP restrictions, who are able to sell at way above market valuation, even&nbsp;$30,000 above&nbsp;market valuation.&nbsp;The point that I am making is that EIP is not the only factor that affects resale prices.&nbsp; There are many other factors that affect&nbsp;resale prices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EIP policy has benefited Singaporeans as a whole by ensuring that there are no ethnic enclaves.&nbsp; We really seek Singaporeans' understanding that EIP is a necessary encumbrance for a greater social good.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>: Mr Sadasivan, last question.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Viswa Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Viswa Sadasivan:</B> Thank you. I understand and&nbsp;most Singaporeans understand the principle of why we need the EIP. But the question is that if an individual, especially from an ethnic minority community, feels that he is disadvantaged financially through the resale flat process because of his ethnic minority status, that is not going to be good. In the instance where they come from one of the 14% of neighbourhoods that&nbsp;the Parliamentary Secretary has talked about, if it is true that he has been disadvantaged because he is from an ethnic minority community, should the Government not find a way to reach out to that individual and help him out?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman--><p align=left>Column: 1199<p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</B> Sir, the point I am making is that it is not conclusive that&nbsp;a sale&nbsp;is necessarily disadvantaged because of the EIP&nbsp;restrictions. There are many attributes that relate to the resale prices, whether he is able to sell the&nbsp;flat at market valuation, above market valuation or below market valuation, it is not necessarily affected by the EIP alone. As I have mentioned earlier, there are sellers who are affected by EIP restrictions and can command&nbsp;very high resale prices.&nbsp; It is not that because&nbsp;of the effect of the&nbsp;EIP, that necessarily&nbsp;flat prices will be depressed. We have to look at the individual cases.&nbsp; The point we are making is that EIP affects everyone, and it has been shown that it is not just the EIP that is depressing prices, because those who are affected by EIP policies have been able to sell their flats way above market valuation, too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:TRANSITIONAL RENTAL HOUSING SCHEME--><p align=left>Column: 1199<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>TRANSITIONAL RENTAL HOUSING SCHEME</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B> asked the Minister for National Development whether he will consider reviving the Transitional Rental Housing Scheme which allowed newly-wed couples to rent flats from the HDB pending allocation of their new purchase flats to assist them in their efforts to set up a home.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (for the Minister for National Development):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, newly-weds have a variety of housing options while waiting for their new flats to be ready.

Containment booms were deployed around the tanker to contain the oil spilling from the vessel and chemical dispersants were used to break down the spilt oil.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To supplement these efforts at sea, an inter-agency effort was simultaneously launched to protect our coastline from the oil spill.&nbsp;MPA deployed additional booms near to shore and alerted waterfront facilities that were at risk of being affected by the spill.&nbsp;Oil booms were also deployed by NParks to protect Chek Jawa while AVA loaned and helped to install canvas skirting at our fish farms in the East Johor Straits to act as barriers to the oil slick.&nbsp;Our agencies monitored the situation round-the-clock, including air quality at our beaches given reports of a petroleum-like smell.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the oil spill could affect Malaysian and Indonesian waters, MPA promptly notified the Malaysian and Indonesian authorities of the incident.

This was in line with an existing trilateral arrangement among the littoral States on combating oil spills in our region.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our agencies did all that they could to contain the oil spill out at sea, but the unfavourable wind and tidal conditions caused the oil slick to reach our shores on the morning of 26th May 2010.&nbsp;NEA and other agencies immediately began cleaning operations on-shore, using a variety of means including the use of oil dispersant, absorbent materials, non-toxic and bio-<p align=left>Column: 1202<p>degradable cleaning agents, vacuum suction trucks and the removal of crude oil-contaminated sand.&nbsp;In total, more than 495 workers were mobilised for the beach clean-up.

However, this means that work injury compensation is payable by the employer or his insurer as long as the claimant can show that his injury arose out of and in the course of employment,&nbsp; regardless of whether the employer was at fault for the work injury. It is therefore necessary to limit the liability of employers under the Act. In contrast, under common law, compensation is awarded only if the claimant is able to prove that the employer is at fault.&nbsp; Since the two systems are based on different principles, it would be inappropriate to directly benchmark&nbsp;WICA&rsquo;s compensation limits to awards for common law claims. Claimants may choose the appropriate avenue based on the specific circumstances of the injuries.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2008, the caps for compensation under WICA were raised: for permanent incapacity compensation, the maximum amount payable was raised from $147,000 to $180,000, with an additional 25%, or a total of $225,000 payable for total permanent incapacity;&nbsp;for death compensation payable to dependants of the deceased worker, the maximum amount payable was raised from $111,000 to $140,000.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mr de Souza that MOM will regularly review the compensation caps to keep in step with changes in wages and medical expenses <p align=left>Column: 1208<p>to ensure that WICA remains an effective means of support for employees suffering from work injuries.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Christopher de Souza</B>:&nbsp; Thank you, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, for your comprehensive reply.&nbsp; I would like to ask a question based on the disconnect between the Work Injury&nbsp;Compensation scheme and what is currently being awarded as just compensation by our Courts.&nbsp; For example, in my parliamentary question, I referred to the $182,000 award limit under the Act,&nbsp;yet the Court awarded $1 million.&nbsp; So, there seems to be a divergence of about $800,000.&nbsp; Given the principle of compensating a workman for his injury, would MOM consider raising the cap because there is a need to pay legal expenses to go to Court and you cannot choose between the two, and you have to either choose one or the other.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Hawazi Daipi</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, workers who have been injured can decide on either one&nbsp;&ndash; the WICA way or the common law.&nbsp; As I said earlier, we revised the cap only in 2008.&nbsp; I think it is a bit too early now to revise it.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is a continuous process that we do at MOM to ensure that compensation is consistent with cost of living, cost of medical treatment, and so on.&nbsp; When the time comes for review, we will review it very seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not so sure how to describe this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the WICA cap and the amount awarded to the injured worker was huge.&nbsp; But, then, that is the nature of common law.&nbsp; If the claimant can prove that the employer was at fault, leading to his injury, then the court will take that into consideration.&nbsp; I think this may be the case in this particular claim.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We may not be able to take into account an amount that has been awarded to past cases&nbsp;in determining WICA <I>per se</I>, because the amount can vary&nbsp;from case to case.&nbsp; It is best that we use what we have been using so far,&nbsp;ie, loss of income, cost of medical treatment, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HEALTH PROFILE OF OLDER SINGAPOREANS--><p align=left>Column: 1209<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, I suppose, in due course, I will fall into this&nbsp;group too if I exceed 85 years old.&nbsp; Other significant diseases which afflict this group of seniors are dementia, vision disorders, hearing loss and arthritis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, about one-third of them&nbsp;would require some sort of hospitalisation. The most common reasons were injuries, especially home injuries&nbsp;resulting from falls, pneumonia, stroke, cancer and heart disease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 9% of them are cared for in a nursing home.&nbsp; Among those living at home, two-thirds have no difficulty with basic activities of daily living and self care.&nbsp; But about 6% have difficulties in at least three basic activities of daily living.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caring for the very old requires more care and assistance.

A new hospital has just opened a few months ago, and a couple more will come about further&nbsp;downstream.&nbsp;There is a need for nursing homes as well.&nbsp;Waiting time has been lengthening, and we have been watching this.&nbsp;Two or three years back, we embarked on a programme to review all existing nursing homes, and we decided on two&nbsp;initiatives which we are&nbsp;now implementing to correct the deficiencies.&nbsp;One is the&nbsp;location of nursing homes. Many of these homes&nbsp;were founded many years ago.&nbsp;Overtime, they find their catchment population disappearing with re-siting of the housing estates.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, they tend to be smaller and therefore do not have the economy of <p align=left>Column: 1212<p>scale to provide&nbsp;many supportive programmes which we now found to be very important, for example, physiotherapy.&nbsp;We&nbsp;need a minimum&nbsp;size to reap certain&nbsp;economy of scale.&nbsp;The conclusion is that we should expand, rebuild and re-site them.&nbsp;We will be&nbsp;doing so, for example, in my constituency in the north, we will be building two brand new nursing homes. They will replace&nbsp;two existing&nbsp;nursing homes which are poorly located. But it is not just&nbsp;my area.&nbsp;I am also expanding some others in the west as well as in the north-east.&nbsp;And we will continue to watch over this. Nursing home construction is simpler&nbsp;because the lead time is short, quite unlike a hospital. Hospital takes seven&nbsp;or eight years to plan.&nbsp;But nursing home takes only two or three years. I am quite sure two or three will come up within the next two or three years.&nbsp;But development&nbsp;is not just for institutional care.&nbsp;It is also for care at the community level. As the Member puts it, with more nuclear families&nbsp;looking after the seniors at home when there is nobody at home other than the seniors, is a big problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was doing my cardiac rehabilitation this morning and was chit-chatting with my physiotherapist. She has an elderly mother.&nbsp;She was&nbsp;sharing with me the challenges.&nbsp;As she is in the same generation as me, she has several siblings to&nbsp;share&nbsp;and take turns. As for the next generation, they will&nbsp;not have that luxury, and it is going to be a big problem.&nbsp;The western world is already experiencing this. Their solution is more&nbsp;institutional care which we, from the Oriental side,&nbsp;are not sure if that is the right decision. The Japanese are experimenting with&nbsp;more neighbourly help.&nbsp;That is why I am fully in support of MND's expansion of studio apartments.&nbsp;We group them together and, at the same time, there are also other non-studio apartments,&nbsp;allowing the&nbsp;young and old to be together.&nbsp;I think that provides a much more interesting lifestyle,&nbsp;with \"buzz\". And if people are neighbourly,&nbsp;they can&nbsp;help watch out for <p align=left>Column: 1213<p>each other.&nbsp;The Japanese do that.&nbsp; Sometime ago, I visited some Japanese old towns and I was struck by how closely bonded the neighbours are.&nbsp;They are not relatives but they watch over each other because today, I help you, next week, you may help me.&nbsp;That is the sort of society and values which we should try to inculcate.&nbsp;At the end of it, prevention is still better. In&nbsp;other words, try to stay well for as long as you can which means keep slim, do not over eat, exercise and eat properly.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, just one supplementary question.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would like to ask the Minister whether he would consider&nbsp;extending&nbsp;home visits for medical care because&nbsp;we are encouraging the elderly&nbsp;to stay&nbsp;within the same residential area.&nbsp; Would the Minister consider asking the community hospitals to develop this arm to support the elderly within the same residential area?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp;The community care to support the elderly at home&nbsp;can come from all sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;Community hospital is one good source where you can base the home care activities. Acute hospitals can play that role too, especially now that&nbsp;I have&nbsp;re-organised our acute hospitals for them to take a much more regional approach to healthcare needs. If I may give the north as an example again, the new Khoo Teck Puat Hospital's&nbsp;mission is not just to look after the services within the four walls of the hospital. My message to them is that they&nbsp;are a hospital without walls.&nbsp;The hospital is&nbsp;just a focal point of activities, perhaps to even provide the thought leadership because they have the specialists who would be able to give authoritative information, for example, on nutrition and&nbsp;physiotherapy.&nbsp;It can help organise these services&nbsp;which are not necessarily based in the hospital but outside it.&nbsp;A major part of their activities is to reach out beyond the four walls.&nbsp;That is the same mandate I <p align=left>Column: 1214<p>am giving to the new hospital coming up in Jurong and likewise to the&nbsp;existing hospitals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp; Mdm Halimah, last question.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> &nbsp; Thank you, Sir.&nbsp; I think for many families, financing&nbsp;home-based care&nbsp;is actually quite a burden,&nbsp;so that affects their ability to keep their elderly sick at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry will consider providing more subsidies for home-based care and also allow for more flexible use of Medisave for home-based care.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Offhand, I am not too familiar with the details,&nbsp;but&nbsp;Members know&nbsp;they have a very sympathetic Health Minister here.&nbsp;I have always been exploring how to help the seniors more, facilitate them more, whether it is through greater subsidy which needs regular adjustments, anyway, with inflation, or allowing greater use of Medisave or&nbsp;mobilising the community to&nbsp;chip in.&nbsp;My own sense is&nbsp;that money is not the key issue.&nbsp;The healthcare needs of an elderly&nbsp;today&nbsp;are being met, but often in the wrong place. If an elderly could be competently cared for at home,&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;he may still get stuck in an acute hospital where the cost is very high.&nbsp;If they do not need the sophisticated services in the acute hospitals,&nbsp;their money could have been saved if they are, what we call,&nbsp;\"right-sited\": whether it is at home,&nbsp;at day care facilities, or&nbsp;being in a lower cost community hospital, or in a nursing home. I think right-siting is definitely the way to go. But I will be the first one to admit that the incentives are sometimes warped so that to a patient, he finds it cheaper to stay or over stay in an expensive Class C ward in an acute hospital when he should be, for example, in a community hospital. Trying to clean up these distortions that have been accumulated over the years has taken me <p align=left>Column: 1215<p>quite a few years and would continue to take me&nbsp;many more months.

As I said, the issue is in the details.&nbsp;&nbsp;How this will work is largely back to back and, therefore, we need specific transactions and specific deals to operationalise the whole procedure.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:TOXICITY OF IMPORTED TOYS--><p align=left>Column: 1219<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</B> : Sir, the Consumer Protection (Trade Descriptions and Safety Requirements) Act provides <p align=left>Column: 1220<p>the broad legal framework to protect consumers from unsafe consumer products.&nbsp; Regulations issued under the Act empower SPRING Singapore to regulate 45 categories of household electrical, electronic and gas products.&nbsp;Products capable of serious, immediate and adverse effects on consumers are gazetted as Controlled Goods and suppliers have to obtain safety certification before they can&nbsp;be legally sold in Singapore.&nbsp;The Act carries a maximum fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for&nbsp;a term of up to two years, or both.&nbsp; Other Government agencies are also vested with the legal authority to regulate the safety of consumer products in specific sectors such as food and medicine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Act&nbsp;also makes it a criminal offence to apply false trade descriptions on all goods.&nbsp; The aim is to protect consumers from being induced by errant traders to buy goods through the application of false or misleading trade descriptions.&nbsp; In the context of product safety, the Act could be enforced against suppliers who falsely describe their products as having met certain safety standards when they do not.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While toys are not screened upfront, their product safety is monitored through various mechanisms such as sharing of information with overseas safety agencies and provision of information by various consumer groups.&nbsp; SPRING Singapore works with suppliers to remove these consumer products from the market once they are found to be unsafe.&nbsp;Given the supply chain involved in bringing a toy to the point of sale, cooperation by all parties is key in ensuring product safety.&nbsp;This was demonstrated recently when the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) brought the discovery of unsafe toys to the public's attention through its tests of 50 toys.&nbsp; Since then, SPRING and CASE have been working with retailers and importers to recall and remove the unsafe toys from the market.&nbsp; SPRING is <p align=left>Column: 1221<p>also conducting checks to ensure that these toys are not carried by other retailers not covered by CASE, and will step up its efforts to detect and remove unsafe toys during the year-end festive periods.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Trade and Industry and SPRING have been reviewing the existing framework to regulate general consumer products before the recent reports on unsafe toys.&nbsp;Based on the study of comparable economies and consultation with stakeholders, including CASE and departmental stores, we are looking at enhancing SPRING&rsquo;s power to recall or ban products that do not meet standards, such as maximum level of lead allowed, when they are uncovered through mandatory notification of safety failures by suppliers, overseas incidents, or sample testings by SPRING.&nbsp; We expect to complete the review by the end of the year, before proceeding to amend the relevant legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The emphasis on ex-post actions&nbsp;is also the approach taken by a number of developed economies such as South Korea, Australia and Japan.&nbsp;It provides a balanced approach that does not impose unnecessary cost on businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The safety of toys is an important issue we must address.&nbsp;Along with the thousands of other consumer goods that are sold and used on a daily basis, we will need an efficient regime to ensure the safety of goods sold in the market.&nbsp;However, we should not over-react.&nbsp;Inspecting all toys upfront without consideration of the practicalities not only slows down the entire process and increases costs for the consumers, it has also not been proven to be effective anywhere in the world.&nbsp;For toy safety, we will continue to enhance product safety standards and surveillance based on our ex-post regime.&nbsp;This will require all parties, including importers, distributors and consumers, to play their part.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><p align=left>Column: 1222<p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

What I am suggesting is this.&nbsp; Could the Minister look into having&nbsp;a certain determined percentage of tests by suppliers before they import their toys and also a self-declaration that the toys are tested according to standards that are imposed by Singapore,&nbsp;rather than just relying on&nbsp;standards established overseas?&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it is&nbsp;both: one, the supplier must comply to our standards and, two, there must be a certain percentage of the toys to be sent for testing, before they can be imported.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I forgot to declare that I am working in a retailer chain.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lee Yi Shyan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lee Yi Shyan:</B> Sir, I want to thank the Member for her suggestions on how to improve the safety regime on toys.&nbsp;Toy safety is obviously very important to many parents and&nbsp;consumers. But we must also realise that, on a daily basis, we come into contact with many things, like the toys for the children, the clothes we wear, the dye&nbsp;and the gel we apply on our hair, the wallet and&nbsp;the cellphone cover that we carry. All of them are potential risks. And toy safety is just not whether it contains certain chemical, like the plasticiser or lead in bright painted products but, also, what if it falls apart and could the small parts pose a danger to children. So far,&nbsp;if you want to certify a particular toy that is safe for a particular age group, there is elaborate testing needed. And what is safe for a 12-year-old to a 15-year-old might not be safe for toddlers, say, below three years old.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have studied a neighbouring country's example and a particular multinational&nbsp;at one time was asked to send all its toys for inspection before they could be allowed to come in.&nbsp;Based on <p align=left>Column: 1223<p>just 6,000 toy varieties that they have, it will take six years just to clear that inventory of toys. And this is just for one company.&nbsp;I cannot&nbsp;imagine if we apply it to the&nbsp;toy industry and,&nbsp;extending the argument, to consumer products that we use on a daily basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the practical approach is really, as the Member suggested, develop our own standard and then increase our ability to detect toys that are unsafe, enhance our surveillance system and enhance our agency's power to ban the sale and recall the products by compelling the distributors, or the importers to do so, backed up by legislative power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I think this is the direction that&nbsp;we are heading. We will continue to educate&nbsp;members of the public and consumers on the need to exercise caution and discretion when choosing their products. We hope to see better labels on toy products, for instance, how they can be used safely and the suitability for different age groups. So, overall,&nbsp;we can look forward to a stronger regime for toy safety next year.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SCREENING OF WORLD CUP MATCHES--><p align=left>Column: 1223<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>SCREENING OF WORLD CUP MATCHES</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16. &nbsp;<B>Er Lee Bee Wah</B> asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (a) what were the criteria used in the selection of the 16 community clubs to screen the recent World Cup matches; (b) whether the Ministry will consider extending the screening of high-profile sporting events to all community clubs in future; and (c) how can a repeat of the issues in securing World Cup broadcasting rights be prevented in the future.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Boon Heng)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Boon Heng (for the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports)</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent live screening of the FIFA World Cup matches at the 16 Community Clubs (CCs) was a tremendous <p align=left>Column: 1224<p>success.&nbsp; About 184,000 residents visited the CCs.&nbsp;Our grassroots leaders and People's Association (PA) staff took this opportunity to organise activities for the participants so that they can get to know one&nbsp;another better.&nbsp; Indeed, the success of the World Cup screening demonstrates the potential of using sports to bring residents together to bond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;the Member&nbsp;may know, there are costs involved in the screening of the World Cup matches \"live\".&nbsp; We were fortunate to have Singapore Pools, SingTel and StarHub sponsored the World Cup screening at the CCs.&nbsp; I must&nbsp;first thank Mr Zainudin Nordin, Mayor for Central Singapore District, for initiating this and for getting&nbsp;the support of the sponsors as well as the other four Mayors.&nbsp; However, as the sponsorship was only for a certain number of sites, we could only extend the screening to a limited number of CCs.&nbsp; The CCs were selected on the basis of having one screening in each Group Representation Constituency (GRC), or three per District.&nbsp; This is to ensure a good geographical spread of the screening at CCs throughout Singapore to benefit residents.&nbsp; The selection of CCs also took into consideration the availability of suitable screening facilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Er Lee asked whether we will consider screening high-profile sporting events at all CCs in the future.&nbsp; PA would certainly like to encourage and facilitate such activities as a way to bring residents together.&nbsp; However, it would depend on whether sponsorship is available to support such screenings and whether approval can be obtained from the rights holder.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, individual CCs may also decide to fund the screenings themselves, if the rights are available.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now touch briefly on the securing of World Cup broadcasting rights. The bidding of broadcast rights of <p align=left>Column: 1225<p>major international sporting events such as the World Cup is a matter of commercial negotiation between the pay TV retailers and the rights holders, based on their respective business considerations. For subsequent World Cup bids, I am sure SingTel and StarHub will draw from the experience and knowledge gleaned from this year&rsquo;s World Cup bidding, especially the price point at which consumers would be willing to pay to view the event. However, the ultimate decision rests on the rights holder &ndash; FIFA, in this case. If FIFA demands a higher bid price and consumers are not willing to pay more, then consumers must, unfortunately, be prepared to forego watching the matches.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would also like to focus on the injection of funds into selected industries as well as the power of the Board to invest and, most importantly, the parameters of the Board.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore overcame the recession in double-quick time and the economy is going strong at the moment, hitting record growth figures.&nbsp; But is it sustainable?&nbsp; To achieve a high growth through high productivity, a new mindset is needed by all&nbsp;&ndash; employers, employees and the Government.&nbsp; How do we change the mindset of employers and employees?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By making it a point to set aside funds, the Ministry makes it clear that the Government is committed to providing long-term support for productivity improvements, irrespective of the state of <p align=left>Column: 1228<p>the economy.&nbsp; We applaud the Government for taking the step towards this mindset change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, during the 2010 Budget debate, it was stated that $2 billion will be injected into the Fund&nbsp;&ndash; with the first billion being given this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred and fifty&nbsp;million dollars&nbsp;from the first $1 billion will be used for raising productivity in the construction industry which the Finance Minister described as a&nbsp;sector which needs to improve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, may I clarify with the&nbsp;Ministry as to how it would determine the industries, which are deserving of the funds, the quantum and duration for which the funds would be disbursed to?&nbsp; How diverse would the disbursement be and how setting aside $250 million or one-eighth of the fund to one industry, namely, the construction industry, be a step in the right direction?&nbsp; How would the Government encourage industry players to be more proactively involved in the productivity drive and in what ways?&nbsp; And, most importantly, how would the Board track and measure the productivity growth of&nbsp;organisations that have benefited from the funds?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, not only must individuals work towards raising productivity.&nbsp; SMEs&nbsp;have to play a part as well, and are under pressure to become more efficient and productive so as to survive in a changing economy.&nbsp; They are often encouraged to abandon old-fashioned ways of operation and to adopt new technologies.&nbsp; The Government is providing grants to adopt technology and improve service levels and human resource practices as well as organising overseas study trips.&nbsp; However, many SMEs do not know how to access these grants and lament the complexity of form filling.&nbsp; How could the application process for grants be simplified and made more user-friendly and productive?&nbsp; After all, these grants are meant to help SMEs and not to add extra burden through a <p align=left>Column: 1229<p>complicated and complex application process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on a separate note, Part lV, clause 20 of the Bill provides that the Board may invest the Fund in \"such manner as it thinks fit\".&nbsp; I have my reservations regarding this \"blank check\" to the Board.&nbsp; I have full faith and trust in the Government that it would have chosen only men of exceptional integrity to sit on the National Productivity Fund&nbsp;(NPF) Administration Board.&nbsp; But $2&nbsp;billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money is no small change and I am sure the Government will prudently manage its funds, given the recent minibonds episode.&nbsp; However, I am for a more prescriptive approach towards enforcing the guidelines relating to investment of the Fund.&nbsp; Could I ask for more details and guidelines on the types of investments to be included?&nbsp; After all, the purpose of the Fund is to raise Singapore&rsquo;s productivity.&nbsp; It would not bode us well to be caught in a compromising situation, where productivity takes a back seat and gains come to the fore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also note that the Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure.&nbsp; May I ask the Ministry whether a rough estimate could be provided?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I see the National Productivity Fund Administration Board as an enabler and supervisor to strengthen the CET system, and growing possibilities for enhancing our productivity.&nbsp; With the set up of the Board, I would like to propose for the need of CET centres to be subject to the GeBiz procurement rules to be waived, as CET centres have already been subject to a stringent set of criteria that satisfies best sourcing practices.&nbsp; After all, best sourcing is not just about pricing alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the principle of procurement subjects vendors to tender for work <p align=left>Column: 1230<p>belonging to the Government and its related agencies.&nbsp; But to subject CET centres to similar tendering process is not only not meaningful but could also be very unproductive.&nbsp; The GeBiz formula stipulates that for any training that works out to $3,000 at any one time, a tender is necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ministries, statutory boards and their agencies embarking on company-wide training in order to achieve a common mindset change, find themselves in a fix when pursuing courseware provided by CET centres.&nbsp; Their training budget will definitely bust the $3,000 ceiling.&nbsp; Once they go through the GeBiz, the following ensues:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;Call for tender, which works out to a minimum of four weeks; and</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;Process and award, which is easily another four&nbsp;weeks, since internally the tender committee has to seek Management or Board's approval.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the words of one agency: \"&hellip; by which time we would not only have lost the momentum but also the productivity of everyone.\"&nbsp; Yes, there can be a waiver for tender or a close tender exercise replacing the normal process, but, again, the time savings is maybe two weeks at most, which does not enhance the spirit and essence of productivity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is most starkly felt by CET centres and, in the case of courseware provided by national CET centres, it would appear strange when the very criteria governing the CET centres are even more stringent than the GeBiz tendering process.&nbsp; Some of these criteria include:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;Courseware to be developed as per standards specified by the Workforce Development Agency (WDA), another agency of the Government;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1231<p>(ii) Courseware to be reviewed and rubber stamped as approved by WDA before being rolled out;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;Courseware to be provided by approved CETs&nbsp;appointed by WDA; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;CET centre being subject to stringent internal audit on a regular basis to ascertain its suitability to remain as a CET centre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we ask, what is the purpose of appointing CET centres?&nbsp; Its original purpose is really to aggregate supply under appointed training providers who meet with the stringent criteria stipulated by WDA, including the fee structure.&nbsp; If that were the case, why is there&nbsp;a need for such CET centres to be subject to such procurement rules when the fee structure is already in place?&nbsp; Is it not timely that we review all this red tape?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should instead stipulate a high standard of governance in the courseware provided by the&nbsp;CET centre, where its role to the Board would be to ensure that high standard prevails in the CET centres.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;high standard will include quality courseware, quality courseware providers,&nbsp;quality training materials, quality training environment, visibility of learning support and continuous courseware enhancement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it not a waste of resources and being very unproductive to repeat screenings for the same criteria? We should be more pragmatic and look at other ways of strengthening the CET system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I propose therefore that this governance role be included as an extended proviso under the Second Schedule, clause 1,&nbsp;to read as, \"To ensure that high standard prevails in the CET centres&nbsp;through the provision of quality courseware, quality trainers, quality <p align=left>Column: 1232<p>courseware authors, quality training materials, quality training environment, visibility of learning support and continuous courseware enhancement.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Board can carry out this role by reviewing evidence pertaining to the above stipulations in the CET centres on a regular basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is also wise that the Board allows itself a linkage with the industry through a double loop feedback channel that will allow it to focus on growing productivity possibilities.&nbsp; After all, if we examine carefully, the Second Schedule, clauses 9, 12 and 13, the Board is operating almost like an enterprise.&nbsp; For an enterprise to thrive, it needs to gather feedback.&nbsp; It is therefore useful to reflect such a mechanism in the Constitution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there may be concern that such powers, as stipulated in clauses 8, 10 and 12 may position the Board on an unequal playing field.&nbsp; It is therefore important to define clearly what the Board will and will not do in its consultancy and training businesses and how it differentiates itself from other training providers in these common areas?&nbsp; In fact, should the Board be involved in the consultancy and training business if it were to play a governance role?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, during the Budget debate on this, it was not clearly spelt out but now that it has been defined, I would like to ask what is the Board&rsquo;s role <I>vis-a-vis</I> CET centres and, more importantly, WDA?&nbsp; Will there be duplication and are we creating another one-stop Government business centre but this time one that specialises in productivity growth?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this,&nbsp;I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.13 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I rise in support of this Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1233<p> The objects for which the Fund may be expended are stated in&nbsp;clause 4 of the Bill and further enumerated under the Second Schedule of the Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is primarily aimed at achieving the objectives announced during this year&rsquo;s Budget debate which is to increase Singapore&rsquo;s productivity level and to promote continuing education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are two very important objectives and the fact that we now have a Fund and a statutory board solely dedicated to our efforts to boost productivity is meaningful, as one of the common complaints in the past is that it is not clear which agency is providing the policy direction or coordinating productivity efforts in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense is that this has led to a situation where productivity has fallen through the cracks and is partly responsible for the current low productivity challenge that we are facing.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of the Fund and a statutory board, our efforts at increasing productivity will be a lot more focused, co-ordinated and policy-driven.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, I wish to seek a number of clarifications. First, increasing productivity is undoubtedly our goal but different sectors and industries face different challenges and are at different levels of growth.&nbsp; As a whole, the manufacturing sector or, more specifically, the electronics sector, which faces fierce international competition is doing better compared to the services sector. &nbsp;It has progressed from labour-intensive, low-value added manufacturing activities to capital-intensive, complex manufacturing activities.&nbsp; More companies are also setting up research and development centres, headquarters and regional/global control towers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The electronics manufacturing sector value added per worker in 2008 is $155,000 and labour productivity grew 6% from 1998 to 2008.&nbsp; However, compared to Germany, Japan and US, even our electronics manufacturing sector has some catching up to do. The situation <p align=left>Column: 1234<p>is far worse in the services sector or the construction sector where productivity growth is much lower and very challenging.&nbsp; Hence, the Productivity Fund Administration Board&rsquo;s task will not be an easy one.&nbsp; Could I seek a clarification from the Minister on how the Board proposes to allocate its resources to cover all the sectors and achieve these varied goals?&nbsp; Also, we are all aware that the SMEs need more help in order to boost their productivity&nbsp;because they lack not only the funds but also the capabilities to move forward.&nbsp; How will the Fund assist the SMEs? Will there be special provisions for them as they collectively employ a significant number of employees?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Specifically, the Fund has to apply to all workers, including professionals, managers and executives (PMEs) and the professional services which have hitherto not been given much attention in our efforts to upgrade the skills of our workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, at least 50% of the workforce is in PME type jobs and the figure will continue to increase with better education and upgrading of capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know based on the statistics that older PMEs find it a lot more difficult to find jobs after they are retrenched.&nbsp; At the other end of the spectrum are our low wage workers and there are several hundred thousands of them.&nbsp; They really need the special attention and support of the Fund to climb up the income ladder through skills training and upgrading.&nbsp; Training for low wage workers can be particularly challenging as they usually hold more than one job and depend a great deal on overtime to boost their monthly income.&nbsp; So, for any training programme to succeed, there will have to be an income subsidy to incentivise them to train and compensate for the loss of income.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister, <p align=left>Column: 1235<p>how would the Fund allocate its resources and support all workers and their different needs?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last&nbsp;point, Sir,&nbsp;is on the issue of accountability.&nbsp; The Government has announced a big budget to achieve our productivity growth of 3% over the next decade.&nbsp; In some sectors, it is easy to measure productivity but not so in others.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ensure that the huge amount allocated to the Fund is really well spent.&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify how would the effectiveness of this Fund be evaluated?&nbsp; What are the measurements and KPIs of this Fund and the Board?&nbsp; Also, the budget allocated thus far is for a five-year time frame.&nbsp; Could the Minister also clarify what are the long-term plans and initiatives of this Fund and the Board&nbsp;as our goal is spread over a 10-year period?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir,&nbsp;I support this Bill.&nbsp; I see the establishment of the Fund and the Board as an important move to upgrade our economy and improve our productivity.&nbsp; I see it also as a way of ensuring a more inclusive growth where low wage unskilled workers could upgrade themselves, enjoy a more productive and meaningful working life and enjoy better wages.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.19 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B> Sir, Paul Krugman in an article published in Foreign Affairs in 1994, had argued that Singapore&rsquo;s steep economic&nbsp;growth model in the early years since independence was largely input driven by increasing capital and labour contribution rather than by total factor productivity.&nbsp; He believes that our growth was driven largely by perspiration&nbsp;than by&nbsp;inspiration; and like the Soviet Union of the 1950s and 1960s, Singapore maintained the expansion of its economic outputs by a massive growth of inputs, such as steep rise in employment, <p align=left>Column: 1236</p>increases in educational levels and massive investment in physical capital.&nbsp; Krugman&rsquo;s thesis contends that there are limits to growth that are focused on expansion of inputs rather than focusing on growth in output per unit of input.&nbsp; In other words, focusing on inputs alone will at some point result in the law of diminishing return applying to the economy.&nbsp; There is, in essence, a limit on the number of workers, level of training and the development of physical capital that a nation can utilise to raise the level of a country&rsquo;s output.&nbsp; Growth beyond a certain point must be focused on increasing the output&nbsp;per unit of input if we are to sustain economic growth at&nbsp;levels witnessed by&nbsp;advanced economies over the last 150 years.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krugman, in essence, is&nbsp;arguing that the true measure of&nbsp;performance of the economy is not just on pure expansion of outputs, but rather the efficiency with which the factors of production such as labour and capital has been deployed to generate that growth.&nbsp; If we apply that principle, a different picture emerges in the case of Singapore in the last decade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the past 10 years, Singapore's productivity growth has averaged 1% per annum.&nbsp; Its productivity in manufacturing is only 55% to 65% compared to that of the United States.&nbsp; In construction, our productivity is only 34% of Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;One key reason for this is that construction companies in Singapore tend to employ low wage workers to do the job while firms in other countries may employ fewer such workers but employ higher skilled workers or employ more machinery or automation.&nbsp; Education, or possibly the lack of, it may yet be another reason for the relatively lower level of productivity.&nbsp; According to a <I>Straits Times</I> report published in February this year, up to 60% of the workers in Singapore never made it past secondary education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krugman's analysis of our economy is not without controversy, particularly <p align=left>Column: 1237<p>when he compared our achievement with that of the Soviet Union.&nbsp; Sir, for now, I do not wish to go into the intricacies of the argument.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that while I do not agree entirely with Mr Krugman, I do agree that&nbsp;it is imperative for the Government to focus more on total factor productivity if Singapore is to continue to grow its economy and to produce the good life for its people.&nbsp; Indeed, I am heartened to note that the Government, together with the Economic Steering Committee, is equally committed to the proposition that priority should be given to the task of nationally raising our level of productivity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against this broad canvas, Sir, I give my full support for this Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to put our money where our mouth is by firmly committing ourselves to promoting productivity in this country.&nbsp; This Bill is timely as the nation is set to bring its economy to the next level.&nbsp; There is no choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to be clearly focused on the efficiency of our&nbsp;factors of production if we are to stay ahead of competition in the global economy.&nbsp; By setting aside money to support productivity initiatives in the form of a Fund to be managed by a statutory board, the Government is clearly putting the issue at the forefront of our&nbsp;nation's consciousness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in setting aside money to focus on productivity, I think we should have some public articulation of how and where such money should be channelled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a doubt, productivity is an issue that cuts across all sectors of our economy&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;whether it is organisations or the people involved in running these organisations, or the technologies or&nbsp;innovations associated with it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, our resources and funds are limited.&nbsp; How such funds are channelled, Sir, may have a bearing on the issue of national unity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why national unity, one might ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a growing sense of unhappiness on the ground over the significant influx <p align=left>Column: 1238<p>of foreign labour&nbsp;in recent years into Singapore, making inroads into various aspects of our society.&nbsp;&nbsp;We see foreign labour participation at two levels; first at the PMET level where there is a gap, in or a lack thereof, of appropriately qualified local staff with the necessary skill sets to handle the demands of a knowledge-based manufacturing and services economy.&nbsp; So huge numbers of such employees coming to Singapore whose presence we see in our housing estates or condominiums. Yet, as with many countries elsewhere, the presence of foreigners in our society living cheek by jowl with the locals and working in appointments that many Singaporeans see are their rightful inheritance has fed a growing sense of xenophobia within our society.&nbsp; It is not uncommon to hear Singaporeans complaining loudly of how foreigners have taken their jobs in the offices they worked for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Truth be told, these foreign PMETs have no doubt contributed significantly to our economy.&nbsp; For without them, Singapore&rsquo;s economic performance would not have powered so strongly over much of the last 10 years.&nbsp; However, having PMETs performing a role in the development of our economy is not in itself a sufficient reason for not improving the productivity of our own PMETs.&nbsp; We need to get our people to be better qualified and more productive than the foreigners so that they can justifiably command higher salaries and, in time, reduce the need to rely on foreign talents to fill these posts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we have over the years had to rely on foreign labour to take on jobs that Singaporeans generally are not keen on and which typically involve work requiring manual labour.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two significant consequences arising from this.&nbsp; First, the presence of these foreign workers who command relatively low wages suppresses both the desire of employers to want to hire Singaporeans as well as discourages Singaporeans from <p align=left>Column: 1239<p>working in these sectors.&nbsp; This has resulted in a significant number of Singaporeans remaining unemployed.&nbsp; Sir, we all know that if we send these foreign workers on work permits home tomorrow, there will be more than enough jobs to absorb the present number of Singaporeans who are unemployed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is:&nbsp; are Singaporeans prepared to take up such jobs at existing wage levels?&nbsp; Secondly, the continued use of low-wage foreign workers in our industries will continue to affect our record on total factor productivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless policies are changed to align Singaporeans who provide manual labour with the desire to improve productivity, our employers will continue to be inclined towards hiring cheap labour where possible to bring down the cost of production.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign manual labour imposes on our resources, which include land for accommodation, and extracts a social cost from us.&nbsp; It breeds deep prejudices among Singaporeans.&nbsp; More importantly, for the Singaporeans who are prepared to work in this sector, there is a rising difference in gap between the top income earners and them in recent years.&nbsp; Economists refer to this income difference as the Gini coefficient. In our case, we have relied on foreign labour to boost our economic growth over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is rather obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last decade, the Gini coefficient has widened&nbsp;significantly.&nbsp; Recent studies have indicated that our Gini coefficient has moved from 0.44 in 2000 to 0.48 in 2009.&nbsp; The Gini coefficient in Singapore measures higher; in other words, there is greater income inequality when compared to, for instance,&nbsp;countries like the United Kingdom, which has an index of 0.34, and Japan with an index of 0.38 in recent years.&nbsp; Most analysts agree that the widening income gap arose from our policy of allowing foreign contract workers to work in our industries under <p align=left>Column: 1240<p>low-wage conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally, the same may be said that the relatively wide gap in our income distribution will narrow once we get more Singaporeans with better training to work in these sectors at higher wages because of the&nbsp;level of output. We need to narrow the widening income gap if we are truly committed to social equity in our country.&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, we cannot lay claim to want to have the living standards of the Nordic countries and yet have a third world income distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Productivity Fund must therefore be clearly chartered to address this concern.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from looking at the issue of productivity for workers, the other issue relates to whether a sharper differentiation ought to be made between foreign-owned companies and our local companies, including the small and medium enterprises.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of productivity cuts across all enterprises; whether these are locally or foreign owned.&nbsp; However, there is a common perception, and quite rightly so, that foreign companies are better endowed with resources to handle issues of competitiveness and productivity.&nbsp; They do not need as much help as local companies do.&nbsp; For the most part, local companies, particularly those in the SMEs, require Government assistance, apart from labour-related issues, in the area of technology transfer, particularly those that relate to improving processes for the manufacture and commercialisation of goods and services.&nbsp; Many of these companies just do not have the wherewithal to embark on initiatives that will help them become more efficient and to compete better.&nbsp; The question really is whether public resources from the Fund should be focused principally on providing assistance to the SMEs to help these companies compete better.&nbsp; The assistance, apart from being employee associated, may relate to assisting these enterprises to build a better eco-system that will help them improve their productivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may include harnessing new technologies or, for that matter, getting relevant qualified <p align=left>Column: 1241<p>consultants to advise them on improvements to the way they organise themselves so that they can compete better.&nbsp; Through the Fund, we hope that&nbsp;new local companies will be spawned that are world-beaters and carry brand names that would sit next to Coca-Cola or Nestle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in a recent study in March this year led by Dr Wilson Chew, CEO and principal consultant at StrategiCom, a branding specialist, it was discovered that nine&nbsp;out of 10 companies surveyed knew what innovation was but only two out of 10 companies went on to do something about it and, more importantly, went on to commercialise their innovation.&nbsp; The innovation had resulted in higher revenues for these companies and, by implication, higher productivity.&nbsp; Quite clearly, a Fund of this nature that is dedicated to productivity through innovation would clearly bring great benefits to our businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, productivity must be based on a certain set of principles.&nbsp; It must not be efficiency at all cost.&nbsp; Over the years, we have learnt to have regard for the environment in the way in which we produce our goods and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;Going Green is not an option but a necessity if we are going&nbsp;to leave something of value for future generations. With the need to protect our environment weighing heavily in our minds, being green in our endeavour to be productive is, I believe, increasingly a standard by which we will be measured by the international community.&nbsp; Against these rising expectations, I&nbsp;hope, Sir, that the new statutory board will, likewise, lean heavily on the side of protecting our environment and the sustainability of our resources when promoting productivity.&nbsp; Improvements in productivity may be celebrated only if it does not come at a cost to the environment, and better still if improvements in productivity help in our efforts to preserve the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1242<p>When the new statutory board and the Fund&nbsp;are established, it would&nbsp;do well to pay heed to these expectations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Sir, I support the Bill standing in the name of the Minister for Finance.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

How can we disseminate the message and understanding on this policy to the public so that when they apply for jobs they will understand that they have to compete with other applicants, not only from Singapore but also with other workers of similar abilities and qualifications, for example, from India, China or Malaysia?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the reality. We now have to compete globally. Therefore, when our skills are better and more specialised, there will be a higher demand for our workforce. Our people must undergo a major change in mindset.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One clarification that I wish to seek is that within the 12 priority sectors identified, who will decide on the type of <p align=left>Column: 1244<p>training and programmes that should be included?&nbsp; Will it be proposed by the new board or by the workgroups? Can it be suggested by the companies, sectors, or can it be that the National Productivity and Continuing Education Council have the final say?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support this Bill and hope that it can be implemented smoothly and fully reach out to all workers and people from the various sectors.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Siong Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.34 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Siong Seng</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;</I> <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20100916/20100916VS_171110.pdf\"\"><I>Appendix A</I></a> <I>*.</I> ]&nbsp;Mr Speaker, good afternoon!&nbsp; First, I would like to declare my interest as the President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce&nbsp;and&nbsp; Industry (SCCCI). Today, I would like to talk about improving productivity from the businesses' point of view.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's Budget focuses on restructuring the economy and raising productivity to further Singapore's economic growth. In his recent National Day Rally speech in August, Prime Minister Lee emphasised again the importance of raising productivity. Businesses respond positively to this call.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I would like to express my views in the following three areas:</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, response from SMEs. The Government is actively pushing the productivity drive, but are our companies taking any actions? SCCCI did a survey. Among the 1,051 companies surveyed, 62% are actively responding to the call to improve productivity and only 8.6% have not taken any actions. Industry-wise, the manufacturing sector is the best with 72% of companies adopting&nbsp;at least three initiatives to boost productivity. This is a very good phenomenon, demonstrating that most companies agree with the <div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr>*Cols. 1293-1294; 1295-1298.<BR></div><p align=left>Column: 1245<p>Government and are taking proactive steps.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the business models of various industries are different. Therefore, it is difficult to come to a unified standard to measure productivity. For example, a famous local <I>bak kwa</I> shop always sees long queues during Chinese New Year. People need to queue two to three hours. In comparison, other stores are not patronised by so many people.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think, besides branding, the major draw of this shop is that its products are handmade and not mass-produced by machines. This is very common in the food and beverage sector. If they try to use automation to replace manual work, consumers may not like it. Our survey also proved this. In the service sector, only 58% of companies are actively boosting productivity, lower than that of the manufacturing sector. The main reason is that it is easier to gauge efficiency in manufacturing, whereas in the service sector, not only cost and efficiency, but also service quality and the consumers' needs are taken into consideration. This makes things more complicated.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Government and businesses have come to a consensus, the next step is to adopt effective measures based on each industry's specific needs and characteristics. For example, the Workfare Training Scheme is more popular in the service sector than in manufacturing, which shows that, compared to other industries, the service sector pays more attention to improving&nbsp; the quality of their staff.&nbsp; I suggest that in the future, the Government could consult the views of the tripartite partners before launching any business assistance schemes or grants.&nbsp; This will increase the effectiveness of the policy, avoid the \"one size fits all\" approach, and benefit more companies.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Productivity&nbsp;and Innovation Credit Scheme, many companies are adopting the wait-and-see attitude. Some <p align=left>Column: 1246<p>say that if they invest in innovation first and apply for tax rebate later, what will happen when the innovation fails and they cannot even get tax rebate? What is more, the investment cannot get tax rebate until the next financial year. \"Water afar cannot relieve current thirst\".&nbsp; Hence, I suggest that the relevant&nbsp; agency review this Scheme to deliver more effective grants and encourage SMEs to take bold steps to innovate. We need to deliver \"coal when it is snowing\" and help SMEs solve their pressing issues.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, encourage professionalism and call for cooperation from consumers. Usually, the way to increase productivity is to simplify the working process, improve product, service and staff quality, and develop value-added services. In this process, we cannot under-estimate the spirit of professionalism. We must reward&nbsp; those staff who love their job and demonstrate a good working attitude.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, to increase productivity, the Government and businesses cannot do it alone. We need everybody to join in. For example, when we eat at hawker centres, and if we put our dishes away ourselves, we can reduce the workload of the cleaners. This also solves the problem of labour shortage. We need to change our mindset. If we can do this at the fast food chains, surely we can do this at the hawker centres. The key is: do Singaporeans want to do it or not?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, spread the productivity message to everyone in the society, including secondary and primary students. Increasing productivity has been a national campaign&nbsp; since the 1980s. This year, the Government is again focusing on productivity to prepare Singapore for sustainable economic growth. I feel that the productivity education should involve all levels of society, including students; by inculcating the notion of productivity from a young age, students would cultivate the right mindset and form an efficient team in the future.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1247<p> Increasing productivity is a long journey. I believe that, under the leadership of the Government and with the joint effort of the tripartite partners, Singapore's productivity is bound to improve.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp; I propose to take the break now.&nbsp; I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 4.00 pm.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"right\"><I>Sitting accordingly suspended</I></p><p align=\"right\"><I>at 3.40 pm until 4.00 pm</I></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan</B>:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr Speaker.&nbsp; I stand in support of this Bill, for it demonstrates the Government's commitment&nbsp;to investing in human capital and raising productivity among Singapore employees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given our demographic trends of sustained ultra-low fertility, it&nbsp;is unlikely that our local resident population will increase in the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far, we have relied on immigration to augment our population strength and maintain our labour force at an optimum level.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not sustainable to depend solely on surplus foreign labour to sustain our labour needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is now, we have already seen the tensions in the social fabric when the proportion of non-resident population hit a high of 25%.&nbsp; Therefore, the focus of Budget 2010 on improving productivity is both timely and significant for the future of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill details the set-up of the National Productivity Fund and how the <p align=left>Column: 1248<p>Fund will be administered.&nbsp;&nbsp;On these administrative details, I have two questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the composition of the Board.&nbsp; Given the power of this Board and its central role in disbursement of the Fund,&nbsp;may I ask&nbsp;the Minister to share with us how the members will be selected?&nbsp;&nbsp;Productivity is a&nbsp;complex concept that we have yet to manage to grasp. Certainly, the composition of the Board will be critical as it will play a significant role in shaping our understanding of this concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to representation from the Government and management-level professionals, I hope we can also include the inputs of mid-level employees who are in direct contact with sentiments from the base-level workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I note that decisions taken by the Board will be decided by a simple majority of the members present. &nbsp;However, in the case of a tie, the Chair will have the casting vote in addition to his original vote.&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise the likelihood that the Chair should have such disproportionate power, may I suggest that the composition of the Board be set at an odd number so that when all members are present&nbsp;&ndash; which I expect would happen as we should only appoint to this important Board members who are totally committed to service&nbsp;&ndash; there will always be a definitive outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Board will have tremendous discretionary power to administer public funds, may I ask if there are avenues for feedback and for the public to query the decisions of the Board?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, while I understand that this Bill focuses on the administration of the National Productivity Fund and this Bill is not intended to discuss policy issues, I think it is important at this stage to reiterate the importance of a holistic approach to understanding productivity and how it&nbsp;can be measured.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this endeavour to enhance productivity, we must embrace labour as&nbsp;value and with <p align=left>Column: 1249<p>respect, and not just a commodity to be maximised.&nbsp;&nbsp;Particularly in the service sector where there must be a sensible balance between output and quality of service, and especially in the careful consideration of good work-life balance where family time and personal space continue to be factored as important variables in the equation that measures output.&nbsp;&nbsp;For issues on policy, I look forward to learning more about the important work of Deputy Prime Minister Teo and his Council.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Second Minister for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank hon. Members Ho Geok Choo, Halimah Yacob, Sin Boon Ann, Fatimah Lateef and NMPs Teo Siong Seng and Paulin Tay Straughan for their support of the Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there have been many detailed discussions on the topic of productivity in this House, especially during the Budget debate.&nbsp;So I would not go over old material.&nbsp; As Members' queries and comments revolve around the roles and responsibilities of the Productivity Fund Administration Board, which I will refer to as PFAB, to be established by this Bill, allow me to reply by clarifying the roles of this PFAB, <I>vis-a-vis</I> firstly, the National Productivity and Continuing Education Council, which I shall refer to as the Council in my elaboration and, secondly, the Government agencies and organisations involved in raising productivity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill is not intended to establish the typical statutory body with policy-making powers and the matching execution capability.&nbsp;It also does not seek to determine upfront the policies regarding how productivity is to be raised.&nbsp;Instead, the purposes for which the National Productivity Fund (NPF) may be used as set out in Part&nbsp;II of the Bill, are defined broadly to enable it to fund productivity initiatives that cover any industry and any employee segment.&nbsp;These are consistent <p align=left>Column: 1250<p>with the sentiments expressed by the Members that programmes funded under the NPF must be sufficiently broad to provide for the diverse needs of the various sectors of the economy whilst ensuring that they meet the primary objective of enhancing productivity.&nbsp; This NPF can therefore be applied towards providing more assistance to the SMEs and to support workers, especially low-income workers in the efforts to upgrade their skills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of the National Productivity Fund will be guided by the advice of&nbsp; the Council, which is chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean. The Council will prioritise and champion national productivity initiatives at the sectoral and enterprise levels, developing a comprehensive, first-class national Continuing Education and Training (CET) System&nbsp;and foster&nbsp;a culture of productivity and continuous learning and upgrading in Singapore. The Council will discuss, review and endorse productivity plans and initiatives, including proposals, which may tap on the NPF as the funding source.&nbsp;The NPFs monies will be used to sustain our productivity efforts over the next decade, with special emphasis initially on sectors where there is potential for&nbsp;large gains in productivity.&nbsp;The 12 sectors identified by the Council so far which span&nbsp;construction, manufacturing, hospitality and business services, have the greatest potential for productivity enhancements, contribute a significant share to the GDP as well as employ a significant number of&nbsp;workers.&nbsp;And many local SMEs are in these sectors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to inform Members that beyond the identified 12 sectors, other sectors can also present their productivity plans and initiatives to the Council for funding consideration. To support the overall productivity drive, the NPF would also help fund part of the inclusive growth programme led by NTUC and this <p align=left>Column: 1251<p>programme will focus on low-wage workers across the different sectors by upgrading their skills, redesigning their jobs and improving the processes within the companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Sin Boon Ann has suggested that the NPF be used to help local SMEs and to level up low-wage workers.&nbsp;While many of the schemes funded by the NPF will benefit these groups, the main objective for the NPF remains that of raising productivity wherever there is significant scope to do so, be it for small or large firms, local or foreign firms, low-wage workers or PMETs.&nbsp; The NPF is more likely to succeed by focusing on the one clear objective of raising productivity.&nbsp; Sir, there are already many other programmes and schemes to cater to other policy objectives, such as to develop the SMEs or to help the low-wage workers. While the NPF will contribute to these objectives, it should not be lumbered with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now go on to the role&nbsp;of the PFAB in ensuring accountability for the Fund. &nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan and Mr Teo Siong Seng asked about the composition of the Members of the PFAB and whether inputs from those who are directly in contact with sentiments from the ground would be included in the decision-making process on productivity initiatives. The PFAB will&nbsp;comprise of&nbsp;Ministers within the Council that will approve the funding proposals that tap on the National Productivity Fund. Precisely for the purpose of achieving broad coverage and wide representation, the Council comprises members from the unions who understand the sentiments of workers well, industry representatives who can take the enterprise and employer perspective and from the&nbsp;public sector for a holistic policy perspective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1252<p> Members have also asked how the outcomes of the programmes funded by the NPF would be assessed.&nbsp; In assessing the programme outcomes, the PFAB and the Council will look at broad&nbsp;indicators such as value-added per worker for international benchmarking of productivity levels. But, at the same time, sector-specific targets would also be set to measure productivity in daily operations.&nbsp;This recognises the need, as Mdm Halimah has raised, for a differentiated approach due to the diversity of the sectors.&nbsp; Once funding from the NPF is approved, the programmes will be administered by the respective lead agencies, which will be responsible for promoting and implementing them. For example, WDA will be in charge of the CET courses funded by the National Productivity Fund while BCA will be responsible for the implementation of construction productivity schemes.&nbsp; Members' specific comments on CET and SMEs would be noted by the relevant agencies. The respective sectoral lead agencies will oversee the communications and publicity efforts for each of the 12 sectors to promote awareness about the productivity initiatives so that more companies can apply for and benefit from them. The Council will also look into creating awareness of productivity at the national level.&nbsp; So Assoc. Prof. Lateef and Mr Teo's suggestions will be conveyed to the Council.&nbsp;The lead agencies will have to account to the Council and the PFAB on the utilisation of the funds and the outcomes achieved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo has raised the specific question about how the monies in NPF will be invested.&nbsp; Sir, the NPF monies will be managed by the Ministry of&nbsp;Finance and a fixed return will be paid by Government to the Fund annually.&nbsp;So there will be no separate team to do just that. The purpose of allowing the NPF monies to be invested is to merely ensure that monies that&nbsp;have yet to be drawn down from the NPF will earn a reasonable <p align=left>Column: 1253<p>return.&nbsp;The PFAB will ensure proper accountability and governance of the use of funds from the NPF and, here, I would like to refer Members to the clauses 22 and 23 of the Bill which require the PFAB to prepare the annual audited financial statements and annual reports and present them to Parliament.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, as Members have rightly emphasised, productivity must be sustained as a long-term and wide-ranging effort as the basis for, in turn, sustaining Singapore's economic growth and a broad-based increase in our incomes.&nbsp;The establishment of the NPF and the PFAB through this Bill is in line with the Government's intent to catalyse and sustain productivity growth over the longer term.&nbsp; Once again, I thank Members for their thoughtful comments and for the support of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;&ndash; [Mrs Lim Hwee Hua]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:PROPERTY TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 1253<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>PROPERTY TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.16 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Second Minister for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill now be read a second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes in the Property Tax (Amendment) Bill 2010, or the PTA Bill for short, arose from the periodic review of our property tax regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments will improve tax administration <p align=left>Column: 1254<p>and provide greater clarity on the tax liability to taxpayers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will highlight three salient amendments.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments are technical or administrative in nature.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Streamlining reporting requirements for property owners</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, property owners are required to inform the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) upon the occurrence of certain events such as whether the property ceases to be occupied by the owners or if the property has been rebuilt.&nbsp; These events may affect the property tax payable and the current reporting requirement provides IRAS with the necessary information to re-assess the property tax accordingly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proposed amendment, property owners will no longer need to inform IRAS upon the occurrence of certain events such as when the building is completed, rebuilt, enlarged, altered or improved. The reporting requirement can be eliminated for such events as IRAS will obtain the required information directly from other Government agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill reflects these changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Fine-tuning the definition of &ldquo;structural networks&rdquo;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next change relates to property tax on structural networks. &nbsp;In 2008, the Property Tax Act was amended to clarify that structural networks, including a network of pipelines, are taxable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose to amend the definition of \"structural networks\" in the Property Tax Act to make it clear, for the avoidance of doubt, that even a single pipeline may be regarded as a structural network for purposes of the Act.&nbsp; This is irrespective of whether the single pipeline constitutes the entire structural network, or the single pipeline is a part of a larger structural network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1255<p>Further, it will be made clear that property tax can be levied on the installed parts of a network that is currently in use or intended to be in use.&nbsp; For example, a network of pipelines that has been installed but has yet to be put to active use for distribution or transmission is liable to property tax.&nbsp; Clause 2 of the Bill reflects these changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Aligning of time-bar to recover outstanding property tax</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;change pertains to the reduction in the time limit for the recovery of Property Tax from six years to five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;This reduction is in alignment with the five-year time-bar period for tax recovery under other Tax Acts (such as&nbsp;the Income Tax Act or the&nbsp;GST Act).&nbsp; The change will be effective from 1st January 2012, to provide time for transition. Clause 9 of the Bill provides for this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Convention seeks to protect the best interests of children from the undesirable effects of transborder parental abduction and retention by providing an avenue for their prompt return and resolution of transborder custodial disputes. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Convention, Contracting States agree to return a child who has been wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State, for an orderly determination by the Courts of the child&rsquo;s habitual residence on the rights of custody and the rights of access.&nbsp; For the Convention to apply, both countries have to be Contracting States.&nbsp; There are currently 82 Contracting States.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is an open and globalised state.&nbsp; More and more Singaporeans are studying, working and living abroad and likewise there are many foreigners living and taking up residence in Singapore.&nbsp; It is therefore not surprising that there is an increasing trend of Singaporeans marrying foreigners, both locally and abroad.&nbsp; The proportion of marriages between Singapore Citizens and non-citizens has increased from 30.7% in 1999 to 40.8% in 2009.&nbsp; Given these trends, we can expect an increase likelihood of transborder custodial disputes.&nbsp; There are benefits for Singapore to accede to this Convention, in particular for the welfare and interest of children born and living in Singapore.&nbsp; This legal framework will allow us to secure the cooperation of other Contracting States for the return of these children to Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, Singapore allows for applications to the Court for orders and directions relating to custody, care and control, and access of the child when there is a marital dispute.&nbsp; However these proceedings often involve protracted and expensive legal battles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1257<p>Acceding to the Convention will put in place the necessary mechanisms for the expeditious return of the child to the appropriate Court which will then determine the issues relating to the custody and welfare of the child.&nbsp; This is in line with our commitment to protect the best interests of the child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has worked with the relevant agencies, including the Courts and the Legal Aid Bureau, to operationalise this Convention.&nbsp; We have also consulted various stakeholders including lawyers, legal academics and women&rsquo;s groups on the draft Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me to briefly describe the key provisions in this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Singapore Central Authority</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the key features of the Convention is that a Central Authority must be established in each Contracting State.&nbsp; This is provided for under clause 5 of the Bill.&nbsp; My Ministry (MCYS) will be appointed as the Singapore Central Authority.&nbsp; The Singapore Central Authority will be operational by 2011 once the Convention enters into force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Central Authority&rsquo;s key role is to provide information on and to facilitate matters relating to the application for the return of a child and to work with other respective Central Authorities in the other States in dealing with such applications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Central Authority will advise and assist the parent who is remaining in Singapore to make an application to the Central Authority of the other Contracting State where a child has been wrongfully removed to or retained in.&nbsp; The Singapore Central Authority will monitor the progress of these applications.&nbsp; And under the Convention, the overseas Central Authority is obliged to facilitate <p align=left>Column: 1258<p>the return of the child, to have the discovery of the whereabouts of the child, and the care and protection of the child. &nbsp;Similarly, the parent remaining in&nbsp; the other Contracting State can also apply to the Singapore Central Authority&nbsp;for its assistance to facilitate the discovery and voluntary return of the child and, where necessary, for the care and protection of the child.&nbsp; These are reciprocal arrangements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from providing for the application of the return of a child, the Singapore Central Authority will, as far as possible, also assist in facilitating access to the child upon request by the parent whose access rights were breached.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Applications to Court under the Convention</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now describe the provisions pertaining to applications to the Court for the return of the child under the Convention.&nbsp; The Convention stipulates that the judicial authorities are to order the return of the child to the country of habitual residence if the Court found that the child was wrongfully removed or retained.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All applications for the return of a child or access to a child under the Convention will be made to and heard by the Family Court.&nbsp; Clause 8 provides for this.&nbsp; The applicant may be the person whose rights of custody have been breached or any other person appearing to the Court to have sufficient interest in the matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Custody rights will be determined by the Court in the child&rsquo;s country of habitual residence upon his or her return.&nbsp; This is based on the principle that the Courts in the child's country of habitual residence are best able to make decisions on the interests of the child.&nbsp; Clause 13 of the Bill thus provides for the stay of any decision on merits of the rights of custody, care <p align=left>Column: 1259<p>and control or access upon an application being filed to the Court.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Convention recognises the need to protect children and to take into account circumstances where the child should not be returned to his country of habitual residence.&nbsp; These circumstances include situations where, firstly, there might be a grave risk that the return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm; secondly, the person having care of the child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or retention; thirdly, if the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take into account of his or her views; and fourthly, where fundamental principles relating to the protection of human rights and the fundamental freedoms are in question.&nbsp; In these scenarios, the Court has the discretion not to order the return of the child.&nbsp; Clause 12 of the Bill thus allows the Court to receive advice from persons who are trained or experienced in matters relevant to the application when considering the return of the child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the child has been ordered to be returned, clause 8 of the Bill empowers the Court to impose conditions or require undertakings before the child can be taken out of Singapore.&nbsp; In addition, for the purpose of securing the welfare of the child, clause 10 of the Bill empowers the Court to make interim orders or to give interim directions for the care and control or access to the child before the determination of the return of the child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Convention also requires Singapore to provide legal aid and advice to applicants who are citizens or habitually resident in a country which is party to the Convention.&nbsp; This has been provided for in clause 17 of the Bill.&nbsp; Applicants applying for legal aid and <p align=left>Column: 1260<p>advice under the Convention will have to fulfil the same means and merits test required by the Legal Aid Bureau in Singapore.&nbsp; In addition, the Legal Aid and Advice Act and the Legal Profession Act will be amended accordingly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the increase in cross-border marriages, this Bill will help deter and to resolve wrongful child removal and retention resulting from the possible breakdown of some of these marriages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that in implementing this Convention, Singapore will facilitate the judicial or administrative proceedings necessary for the prompt return of the child in his or her best interest.&nbsp; This paramount principle will remain to always protect the best interest of the child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Since society and families have become more internationalised, international cases of child abductions have been drawing attention as a serious social problem.&nbsp; As child abduction is a serious infringement of the welfare of the child, preventing child abduction is an extremely important goal to be achieved by the international <p align=left>Column: 1261<p>community.&nbsp; As more than 80 countries had already ratified the Convention, Singapore's ratification of it is timely and necessary. &nbsp;This Bill gives effect to our obligations under the Convention and I support it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, I have a few clarifications to seek.&nbsp; First, even as we adopt measures under this Bill in order to give effect to our international obligations, we have to ensure that we do not end up giving greater protection and support to parents caught in cross-border disputes involving the abduction of their children but less or little support to those caught in domestic abductions of their children.&nbsp; In other words, is this Bill giving more rights to parents caught in cross-border abductions of their children compared to those where the abductions took place in Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill provides substantial support&nbsp;in order to swiftly return an abducted child to the aggrieved parent from a Contracting State.&nbsp; The Central Authority, which under this Bill, will be the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, would have to locate the abducted child in Singapore and then urge the errant parent or other persons to voluntarily return the child to the parent from the Contracting State asking for help. &nbsp;If this fails, then the Minister would either have to bring the case to court or offer various types of support to the parent from the Contracting State to file a lawsuit in Singapore.&nbsp; This is clearly stated in the Bill which provides for the Central Authority to \"take all appropriate measures to discover the whereabouts of a child who has been wrongfully removed or retained\". It also provides for the Minister to \"provide or facilitate the provision of legal aid and advice, including the participation of legal counsel and advisers\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of child abductions that take place domestically, however, no such assistance or less of such assistance is <p align=left>Column: 1262<p>available.&nbsp; Usually the authorities would leave it to the affected parent to seek a court order as the Police view this as a domestic issue which they should not interfere in.&nbsp; Parents affected by domestic abduction cases suffer from the same anguish and pain as those involved in cross-border abductions and they should similarly be provided with help and support to locate their abducted child and to have the child returned to them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill will also provide legal aid to a parent from a Contracting State who applies to court for an order. Again, are we providing more rights to them compared to our own citizens involved in similar disputes but domestically?&nbsp; We need to have consistency and a balance between the procedures to deal with domestic disputes over parental child abduction and procedures involving disputes over international abductions or cross-border abductions to which the Hague convention applies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether the MCYS will work with the other agencies, such as the Police, to review the current procedures so that more could be done to help parents affected by abductions that take place domestically?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point is on the designation of the Central Authority under this Bill.&nbsp; The Hague Convention requires a ratifying state to appoint a central authority.&nbsp; The role of the central authorities in the Contracting States is to do their utmost to achieve the objectives of the Convention.&nbsp; The central authorities of these countries are supposed to be in close contact with each other and also to work with the various agencies in their own countries as well.&nbsp; The Bill provides for the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports&nbsp;to be the Central Authority for Singapore.&nbsp; I seek a clarification as to whether this is appropriate and what are the reasons for designating the Minister <p align=left>Column: 1263<p>as the Central Authority?&nbsp; In the US, for instance, the Central Authority is the Department of State's Office of Children's Issues that has been designated as the&nbsp;authority.&nbsp; Should a similar arrangement&nbsp;not apply in Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, the Bill mandates the return of an abducted child to his or her \"habitual residence\" before the abduction took place. This is the most significant part of the Convention as the Central Authority's function is primarily to make sure that the child is returned to the place of habitual residence.&nbsp; However, there is no definition of what amounts to an abducted child's habitual residence in the Convention.&nbsp; Could the Minister give some indication as to what could constitute a place of habitual residence?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support the Bill.&nbsp; This is indeed&nbsp;a progressive Bill and this a right move on the part of Singapore to adopt to rectify this Convention.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Fatimah Lateef:</B> Mr Speaker, I stand in support of this Bill, which will assist in the local application and implementation of the Hague Convention and I feel it is time for Singapore to align and become a signatory of the Convention which has been around since 1983 with 82 members to date.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me reiterate the two main aims of the Convention, namely:(1) to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to, or retained in any signatory state; and (2) to ensure that the rights of custody and of access under the laws of one state are effectively respected in other signatory states. As such, Sir, it will be beneficial for Singapore to join as a signatory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In today&rsquo;s global village that we live in, cross-border interactions, relationships, <p align=left>Column: 1264<p>and even marriages are increasing. In the event that some of these do work out, there are certainly risks of one parent taking the child out of the country where the other spouse is not. If not done amicably, or done on a unilateral basis, these can have consequences, most certainly. And the Hague Convention can, thus, offer a framework to help in the resolution of such situations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parental child abduction is a global phenomenon, Sir. For example,&nbsp;there was a 27% rise in the number of applications made under the Hague Abduction Convention between 1999 and 2003 and Singapore is certainly not exempt.&nbsp; In a local study by Debbie Ong <I>et al</I>, from 2001 to 2006, 26 cases of child abductions were dealt with by our Family Courts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-two cases of the 26 were abductions outside Singapore and four within Singapore.&nbsp; Overall, 16 out of the 26 cases or 62% remain unresolved to date and the 10 cases that were settled took an average of 15.3 months to be solved.&nbsp; Some of the cases that involved outgoing countries included countries such as Australia, Canada, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Netherlands, Malaysia, New Zealand, Vietnam and the UK; and the incoming cases involved countries like Thailand and Norway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill, Sir, is also a very good illustration of how, national, regional and even international collaboration and teamwork can come into play to assist in alleviating difficult situations.&nbsp; As States abiding to the Convention will have their own unique laws, will there be any other international understanding or binding agreement on the matter?&nbsp; I would like some clarification on that, please.&nbsp; And it is also stated and I quote, \"this Convention shall apply as between Contracting States only, to wrongful removals or retentions occurring after its entry into force\".&nbsp; This would mean that there will be no retrospective effect of the Bill. What will be the options then, for <p align=left>Column: 1265<p>cases that are pending or ongoing, ie,&nbsp;those that happened before 2010?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with reference to&nbsp;article 4, it is stated that the Convention shall cease to apply when the child attains the age of 16 years.&nbsp; Can I clarify&nbsp;what will happen if the abducted is a mentally subnormal person or child who is, say, 17 years of age?&nbsp; What would be the approach for&nbsp;such cases? &nbsp;Also, Sir, with regard to section 13, the clause and I quote, \"by any person appearing to the court to have sufficient interest in the matter\", there perhaps should be some clarification&nbsp;on this, for example, who is \"the persons\"? Should it be previous caregivers, a next-of-kin, a child welfare officer or a VWO personnel, etc? Some clarification would be needed on that as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, all in, I support this International Child Abduction Bill. &nbsp;Singapore has much to gain with this Bill and from the Singapore study I quoted earlier, the majority of abductions are out of Singapore, thus, ceding to the Hague Convention and passing this Bill will help Singapore-based citizens recover their children quickly.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Members for their <p align=left>Column: 1267<p>support of the Bill and for their relevant questions and comments.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Assoc. Prof. Paulin Straughan asked what are our considerations and why did we take so long?&nbsp; I think Members of this House know that the Singapore Government takes its commitments extremely seriously,&nbsp;in particular, before agreeing to an International Convention which will place obligations on us.&nbsp; We need to be very sure first that it is the right thing to do.&nbsp; Secondly, that we have set up a mechanism so that we can do the right thing.&nbsp; Thirdly, that we have consulted our stakeholders and people know what this is all about.&nbsp; So, it has taken us some time but we are now on the verge of acceding to this Convention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next question was posed by Mdm Halimah and she asked why the Bill appears to name the Minister as the Central Authority.&nbsp; I would like to reassure her that it is the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports that will be appointed as the Central Authority.&nbsp; My role as Minister is to oversee that this is done properly and in accordance with the law as passed by Parliament.&nbsp; The Authority will, therefore, be a new department set up within the Ministry to perform its role.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next question I wanted to deal with was from&nbsp;Assoc.&nbsp;Prof. Fatimah Lateef and she said, basically, how would we deal with the applications given that we will&nbsp;be dealing with trans-border disputes.&nbsp; If we sign on, we will be the 83rd country and there are likely to be 83 different unique legal systems in place.&nbsp; Well, on accession, all Contracting States are required to discharge their obligations and their responsibilities as spelt out under the Convention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Convention recognises that the Contracting States may have their own <p align=left>Column: 1268<p>uniquely legal and judicial arrangements and, therefore, Contracting States have the flexibility in the way they implement the provisions of the Convention.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private International Law which will monitor the operations of the Convention in all the Contracting States.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will monitor them, for instance, by having yearly questionnaires on the state of the implementation in the respective States.&nbsp; There will also be special Commission Meetings which are organised and there will be reports which we will all have to submit and, based on these reports, they will do their best to ensure that there is alignment and that the objectives and the key principles and the spirit behind the Convention are fulfilled even while we know that implementational details will differ.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next question was on the issue of age.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef brought up the example of&nbsp;an abducted child who was mentally subnormal but is now 17 years and therefore technically beyond the remit of this Convention.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Convention seeks to protect children specifically under the age of 16 from the harmful effects of parental abduction and retention.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a successful application under this Act, the child must be below the age of 16 when the application is made to the Central Authority.&nbsp; The age cut-off is based on the premise that children below the age of 16, by definition, are more vulnerable and in greater need of protection.&nbsp; But for other exceptional cases like the example&nbsp;she has cited, the parents can still apply to the courts under current domestic laws if there is custody or access issues to be determined.&nbsp; In other words, discretion still lies with the Family Court.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next question&nbsp;posed by Assoc. &nbsp;Prof. Fatimah Lateef&nbsp;was to clarify&nbsp;how do you define a person appealing to the Court to have sufficient interest in the matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who is eligible to apply <p align=left>Column: 1269<p>for the return of a wrongfully removed or retained child would include a person whose rights of custody have been breached or any other person where the Court exercising its discretion, feels has a right to be heard and has an interest in the outcome of the case.&nbsp; I do not want to excessively hard-code this because, again, I want to remind Members of the House that we do need to leave these decisions, which are difficult decisions, even in the best of times, to be made at the discretion of the Judge in the Family Court.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked a question on whether the Bill in mandating the return of a child who was habitually resident in the Contracting State immediately before that action,&nbsp;constitutes breach of custody or access rights, and&nbsp;asked me on the definition of \"habitual residence\".&nbsp; The term \"habitual residence\" is not defined specifically in the Bill.&nbsp; This is in line with the practice of the Convention and&nbsp;the Contracting States.&nbsp; In other words, it is not defined so that the Court will have discretion to determine the child's country of habitual residence and the Court will arrive at such a determination based on evidence adduced.&nbsp; For instance, let me correct a common misperception.&nbsp; The country of habitual residence does not refer to a child's domicile or citizenship or passport that the child may hold but the Court, instead, will take into account factors which determine a child's personal ties to a place.&nbsp; Relevant factors that a Court may consider&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I want to emphasise \"may\" because their discretion still takes precedence&nbsp;&ndash; would include factors like the age of the child, whether he or she has his own views, the maturity of the child, the child's cultural affiliations.&nbsp; For instance, the language he or she speaks or the place that he or she has the most links to,&nbsp;the country, perhaps, where he has been in school the longest, and so on.&nbsp; There will be many other factors.&nbsp; The point I am trying to make&nbsp;here is that, we cannot be&nbsp;sitting in this House hard-code <p align=left>Column: 1270<p>all the different permutations or factors which the Court would have to take into account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I want to touch is on the welfare of the Singaporean parent and the child and Assoc. Prof. Paulin Straughan has enquired as to the number of reported cases where Singaporean wives have had to flee from abusive foreign spouses.&nbsp; From 2007 to 2009, on average, there were 17 Protection Orders made by Singaporean wives against their foreign husbands but obviously this only refers to cases within Singapore.&nbsp; I do not have the statistics for cases of Singaporean women living overseas who have filed for similar protection from abusive foreign spouses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Paulin Straughan also wanted to know how many Singaporeans are victims, how Singaporeans who are victims of abuse can be helped in the event that they face such a situation.&nbsp; Singaporeans who face spousal abuse can seek advice and counselling support from social workers in the Family Service Centres.&nbsp; If there is evidence of abuse, our child protection and our family violence mechanisms within the Ministry and in the other relevant Ministries will be activated.&nbsp; And victims of abuse who need shelter while the Court proceedings are ongoing can be housed in a crisis shelter until the crisis is resolved.&nbsp; As I have mentioned in my earlier speech, the Convention recognises the need to protect children and to take into account circumstances&nbsp;where the child should not be returned to his country of habitual residence.&nbsp; And these circumstances include situations where there is a grave risk that the return would subject the child to physical or psychological harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is lack of evidence of grave risk or harm, the Singapore Central Authority will also work closely with the overseas Central Authority to make sure that protective factors are in place before the child is returned.&nbsp; So, again, the point I am trying <p align=left>Column: 1271<p>to make here is that this will have to be a multi-agency effort and sometimes even a trans-border effort in order to secure, first, the safety of the child and, secondly, the protection of the more vulnerable member of the partnership.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was another question: what if a case arises where a minor child brought here by the Singapore parent does not want to leave?&nbsp; Will the child's request be taken into consideration?&nbsp; I think I have answered this earlier.&nbsp; The Court will certainly listen to the child but the Court will have to take into account the age and maturity of the child and the totality of the best interest of the child.&nbsp; It will be a factor for consideration but it cannot be the only or substantive factor to be considered by the Court.&nbsp; There was another question on cases which are currently pending judicial outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reassure&nbsp;Members, and I know that even as we speak there are cases ongoing,&nbsp;that families who are currently undergoing Court proceedings, they will not be affected as Article 35 of the Convention states specifically that there will be no retrospective effect.&nbsp; So for those cases which have already commenced, we will let the law take its course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah brought up a larger issue of whether there is any disparity in treatment:&nbsp;first, a disparity in treatment where the parental abduction has occurred locally and then whether there is a disparity in treatment between citizens and foreigners.&nbsp; Let me deal with the first question on disparity between parental abductions which have occurred locally in Singapore versus trans-border.&nbsp; I think the first thing&nbsp;that I would like to remind Members is that&nbsp;the objective of this Convention is not about returning the child to the parent.&nbsp; It is about returning the child to the country of his or her habitual residence so that the relevant <p align=left>Column: 1272<p>Court will make that determination.&nbsp; Therefore, in a case where the child has not been removed out of Singapore, the issue does not arise at all because this child and both his or her parents are in Singapore and subject to the jurisdiction of Singapore Courts.&nbsp; So there is no question of disparity in that case.&nbsp; The other issue is whether we are treating&nbsp;citizens and foreigners equally.&nbsp; As I said earlier in my opening speech, even when someone applies for legal aid, they will have to pass the same means and merit tests that all citizens will have to undergo.&nbsp; So I can give Members of this House an assurance that there will be no disparity in treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, I would like to emphasise that being a party to the Convention, provides an avenue for expeditious and clear resolution of such trans-border custodial disputes and, hopefully, actually deters parents involved in an acrimonious breakdown of a relationship from trying to take the law into their own hands and abducting their&nbsp;children.&nbsp; This Convention works on the principle that in such circumstances, the proper Court should make a determination after considering all factors in order to secure the best interest of the child.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our acceding to this Convention allows us to operationalise our commitment to this principle.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir,&nbsp;I just would like to clarify the point that I made earlier.&nbsp; I think the Minister missed my point.&nbsp; I am fully aware that the purpose of this Convention and this Bill is to return&nbsp;the abducted child to the place of habitual residence of the applying parent.&nbsp; What I am asking about the disparity is that abductions&nbsp;also take place locally by a parent, and usually one parent abducting the child where the other parent has been given custody, for instance.&nbsp; I&nbsp;want to ask whether the Ministry will review existing procedures that are in place because, very often, the feedback I get is that the <p align=left>Column: 1273<p>parent, who is affected because his or her child is being abducted, will be told that this is a matter for the Court to decide.&nbsp;&nbsp;He or she, who is aggrieved, should go to the Court to enforce the order.&nbsp; Whereas under the Convention, under the Bill, the Central Authority will have to assist in locating the whereabouts of the child when it involves cross-border abductions, and it will have to try and persuade the errant parent to return the child voluntarily, failing which, to assist the aggrieved parent to file a case in Court.&nbsp; So there&nbsp;is a lot more assistance rendered to the parent of a child caught in cross-border abduction as compared to&nbsp;a child caught in domestic abduction because, often, the Police would say that, \"Look, this is a domestic matter.&nbsp; Could you please go to Court and get your order enforced?\"&nbsp;which I think now that we have this Bill to take care of cross-border abductions, the same principle should extend even to abductions of children from parents who have custody of them domestically.&nbsp; So, that is what I am asking for&nbsp;a review.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> I thank Mdm Halimah for that additional clarification of her question.&nbsp; Let us go back to the example of a trans-border abduction,&nbsp;where, pursuant to the application of this Convention, a child has to return to the country of habitual residence.&nbsp; As I said earlier, it does not mean that necessarily this child be handed back to the other parent in the other country.&nbsp; What it obliges us to do is, where possible, where it can be done voluntarily and amiably, to persuade the parent here to bring that child back to the other country and submit himself or herself to the jurisdiction of the Court.&nbsp; The Court in that country will still decide on the question of access and custody.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in a local case, first, many of these so-called child abductions sometimes occur even before a divorce has been made absolute or even before a custody <p align=left>Column: 1274<p>order or access order has been issued.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a circumstance, there is no question of abduction or kidnapping because both parents have rights to access and, in fact, have a duty to take care of the child.&nbsp; So you cannot have a situation where one parent goes to the Police and says, \"I want you to go and find the other parent because he has taken my child away.\"&nbsp; And the Police will quite rightly say, \"What court order do you have?&nbsp; What judicial arrangements have been made?\"&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a court order which says you have custody of the child and the other parent has contravened that court order,&nbsp;the jurisdictional regulatory and&nbsp;enforcement actions will kick in. &nbsp;But, in the absence of that,&nbsp;the Police are still quite right to say, \"This is a domestic dispute.&nbsp; The proper forum for it to be settled, first, preferably is between the two adults who are parents of this child.&nbsp; If you can't, you go to Court, you get a court order and the court order will be enforced.\"&nbsp; I think underlying&nbsp;the Member's&nbsp;question is an appeal to the authorities, wherever possible, to help facilitate the mediation between parents and to make sure the court orders are enforced.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

<p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, when a person has been ordered under this Convention to bring the child back, he or she is just restoring <I>status quo ante</I>.&nbsp; There are two people in a single country who may have a dispute about custody and care of a child and they have to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the Court and they must comply with the court order.&nbsp; Each respective country after that will have its own ways of enforcing those court orders.&nbsp; So, that is the point I wanted to make.&nbsp; The Member has a&nbsp;valid point but I did not want to conflate it&nbsp;into the debate on this Bill because this Bill does not resolve all the domestic problems that surround this very difficult and usually acrimonious breakdown in <p align=left>Column: 1275<p>relationship.&nbsp; The only generic point I want to emphasise here is to make an appeal to all parents that we should prioritise in the best interest of their children,&nbsp;and that unilateral action and certainly action against the law on trans-border abduction is not the ideal way to solve the problems that have been generated by a breakdown in the relationship between parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we all understand that but, having said that,&nbsp;we&nbsp;also recognise that life is not perfect, relationships can always cause problems, and in this area you&nbsp;actually see otherwise normal good people behaving at their very worst because emotions are so raw.&nbsp;&nbsp;To put this in context, we are just trying to reduce and&nbsp;deter the complications of trans-border abduction, but there is still a lot more work that will have to be done in the domestic sphere.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

It is a most perplexing situation, not helped by being asked to go to Court to enforce the custody order or the access order.&nbsp; So, will there&nbsp;be that coordination support system from the relevant agencies?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

With growing affluence, car ownership has increased in recent years.&nbsp; This has resulted in localised shortages at about 10% of HDB car parks.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB adopts a two-pronged strategy of increasing supply while managing demand to meet residents' needs for car park spaces.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To improve availability of car park lots for residents, HDB reserves more red or red/white lots for season ticket holders.&nbsp; HDB also groups car parks together for season parking to even out the demand for car parking and give residents more parking options.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, HDB will spend $66 million to provide 5,000 additional car lots where there are localised shortages.&nbsp; Where land is available, HDB will increase the capacity of existing car parks by extending surface car parks, converting vacant land to car parks, or building new multi-storey car parks.&nbsp; Additional decks will be added to existing multi-storey car parks where technically feasible.&nbsp; Work has already begun and 1,100 of these lots will be ready by end-2010 to address the shortages at 26 car parks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, land is limited. HDB also has to balance the need for parking space with other needs for green spaces or other amenities.&nbsp; Thus, it is essential to complement supply measures with demand management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB will safeguard parking lots for residents' needs by regulating short-term demand for parking lots.&nbsp; The increase in the Night Parking Scheme (NPS) charges from $2 to $4 with effect from 1st November 2010 is one such measure.&nbsp; The NPS charges were last revised in 1989.&nbsp; Then, the season parking rates for surface and covered lots were $50 and $75 respectively.&nbsp; The corresponding season parking rates today are $65 and $90.&nbsp; Using NPS for 30 nights costs less than the season parking rates.&nbsp; Therefore, the NPS rates need to be revised to manage night parking demand.&nbsp; More motorists may choose to pay the half-hourly rate of $0.50 instead of the revised NPS charge and shorten their stay.&nbsp; Motorists who need to park overnight regularly are encouraged to purchase a season parking ticket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At car parks with high demand for season parking, HDB would also remove the Night Parking Scheme and Free Parking Scheme on Sundays/Public Holidays to reduce competition for lots from visitors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1281<p> Another strategy to increase short-term parking turnover is the Electronic Parking System (EPS).&nbsp; However, EPS is only viable at some car parks, due to the car park layout and high implementation costs.&nbsp; HDB plans to implement EPS at another 300 car parks over the next five years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parking shortages can also be attributed to the increased demand from households with more than one car.&nbsp; There are about 36,000 HDB households owning more than one car, which is an increase of 60% compared to 2006.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To manage demand, HDB accords priority for season parking tickets to the first-owned vehicle of each household on a first-come-first-served basis.&nbsp; If there are season parking tickets left, they will be sold to the households with second and subsequent-owned vehicles (second priority).&nbsp; The balance will be sold to residents who buy season parking tickets for vehicles not owned by them and non-residents (third priority).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We seek the understanding of motorists that in land-scarce Singapore, we need to manage the demand for car parks even as we increase the supply where feasible.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1281<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HDB RESALE FLATS--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>HDB RESALE FLATS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Information on loanshark activity for prospective buyers--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Information on loanshark activity for prospective buyers)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad </B>asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB will consider allowing prospective buyers of resale flats to request for information pertaining to police reports made of loan shark activity for the flats they intend to purchase; and (b) what measures are in place to protect prospective resale flat buyers from sellers who suppress information which may affect the security and safety of the next owner.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospective resale flat buyers should exercise due diligence, and check on the flat attributes carefully before making a purchase. They can also check with neighbours of the flat they are buying whether there were previous harassment incidents.&nbsp; In the case of loan shark harassments, the fact that a Police report was lodged does not always mean that the flat owner is a debtor.&nbsp; According to the Police, there are cases where harassment was targeted at multiple households to pressurise the real debtor to pay up.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The National Registration Act already requires Singapore residents to report their change of address to the Singapore Police Force (SPF) or the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) within 28 days. In addition, HDB and the Police have worked together to prevent such persons from falsely reporting a change of address, or from hiding behind the address of an innocent household.&nbsp; HDB requires flat sellers to provide forwarding addresses. Lessees who sublet bedrooms must also register with HDB within&nbsp;seven days.&nbsp; These measures facilitate the Police's tracing of individuals involved in illegal borrowing. With the amendment to the Moneylenders Act in January 2010, borrowers who deliberately provide false addresses face imprisonment for up to a year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flat owners who face harassment by loan sharks should make a Police report.

The schools received about 850 applications. Parents have the choice to approach any of the SPED schools to apply for admission and some parents make multiple applications. This largely explains why the number of applications exceeds the number of children allocated places. If an applicant does not gain admission into a particular school because of a lack of fit with the admission criteria, the child will be referred to another school which can better meet his or her needs. Every child who applies for admission should be able to find a place in one of the SPED schools.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All, except one, SPED schools have sufficient places to meet the demand for admission. Pathlight School, which serves autistic children who are able to access the mainstream curriculum, has a wait list. Students in the wait list are currently enrolled in other SPED or mainstream schools. Parents of these children have been advised that there are sufficient places in other SPED schools catering to children with autism. Children with mild autism could also remain in mainstream schools with Allied Educators who can help to support their learning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current capacity of the 20 SPED schools is 6,700, of which 4,900 places have been filled.&nbsp; There are sufficient SPED school places across the different disability types, including autism.

Since its inception, SSP has housed and nurtured over 600 talented student athletes to realise both their academic and sporting potential.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the sporting front, the SSP has produced, to date, two Olympians, six World Champions, two Asian, one Commonwealth and 23 SEA Games Gold medallists. Their students have broken 50 national records. At the recently concluded Youth Olympic Games, 22 out of 131 Team Singapore athletes were from SSP. They won a silver medal in table tennis and a bronze medal in taekwondo, and formed a large part of the football team that won a bronze medal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Academically, the School has also done well. Of the 39 students who sat for the 2009 GCE O-Level examinations, one in three candidates achieved five or more distinctions. At least 75% of candidates were eligible for junior college, and 97% for polytechnic entrance. The distinction and pass rates for the majority of core subjects have also surpassed the national averages. MOE's Performance Indicators for School Management (PRISM) that evaluate effectiveness of schools based on comparison between actual O-Level results and expected performance, have also shown SSP's value-add, with O-Level students performing above expectations with a mean subject grade of 2.7, higher than the expected grade of 3.5.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure adequate preparation for further education and employability, SSP builds partnerships and pathways that cater to students of differing academic abilities. Students can now sit for the O- and N-Level examinations, as well as enrol in diploma programmes such as the Republic Polytechnic-Singapore Sports School Diploma in Sports and Leisure Management. The School will also commence the six-year International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme from 2011, beginning with the current 2010 Secondary 1&nbsp;cohort. These extended academic pathways allow students more time in the Sports School to optimise the integration of studies, training and competition, and enhance the quality of young athletes progressing to senior elite levels. The various post-secondary pathways also offer their students the opportunity to gain admission into local or reputable overseas universities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, SSP, in partnership with the Singapore Sports Council, offers a customised athlete lifestyle programme, which helps provide SSP athletes with support services in education, career and life-skills development, to enable them to integrate their sporting aspirations with their career goals. With the conclusion of the YOG, my Ministry is also planning a comprehensive review of the overall career and education support for our athletes.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1285<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:WORKFARE INCOME SUPPLEMENT--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>WORKFARE INCOME SUPPLEMENT</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Impact on low-income Singaporeans--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Impact on low-income Singaporeans)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong </B>asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how effective has the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme been in boosting the wages of low-skilled and low-income Singaporean workers, in particular cleaners; (b) whether the wages of the <p align=left>Column: 1287<p>lowest-income group have seen increases over the past&nbsp;five years; and (c) if so, what is the percentage of increase each year, calculated with and without the WIS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nominal income of the resident full-time workers in the first quintile increased by an average of 1.5% per year over the last five years, after taking into account a 2.2% decline in 2009 as wages fell across the board because of the recession.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is designed to supplement the income and retirement savings of older low-wage workers.&nbsp; WIS gave each recipient a supplement to their income averaging over $1,000, or more than one month's worth of wages, for work done in 2009.&nbsp; WIS was enhanced this year to include more workers and raise the maximum payout from $2,400 to $2,800.

Another five primary schools will turn single-session next year. Most Government and Government-aided primary schools would move to single-session by 2016.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To allow all our primary schools to go single session, MOE plans to build up to 18 new primary schools and enhance the infrastructure of up to 80 existing primary schools in phases. In the first phase, MOE will build 11 new primary schools and upgrade 28 existing schools. With the additional places in the new schools, the Primary 1 intake of existing schools can be reduced to allow them to transit to single session.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools that have moved to a single-session model have shared positive feedback about being able to provide a better environment to develop their pupils. By providing pupils with more time and space to interact meaningfully with their teachers, the implementation of single-session model helps balance the acquisition of knowledge with the delivery of skills and imparting of core values to our children. Teachers from all six levels also have a common time to collaborate and share best pedagogical practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single-session school operation has also helped to minimise logistical issues in the scheduling of activities, such as the Programme for Active Learning (PAL). For example, New Town Primary School has been able to schedule two hours of PAL activities within curriculum time on two separate school days and it has sufficient facilities to support the allocation of the classes to participate in the different PAL activities during the PAL time slot.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1289<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:PHASING OUT OF TRAINING SUBSIDIES--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>PHASING OUT OF TRAINING SUBSIDIES</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:SPUR--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(SPUR)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo </B>asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the phasing out of training subsidies under the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) will force employers to cut back on training for their employees; and (b) if so, how will the Ministry address the issue of employees continuing lifelong training for skills acquisition.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPUR is a two-year programme established specifically to help companies and workers manage the economic downturn and invest in skills for the recovery. With the strong economic recovery this year, the programme will cease in December 2010. Since the inception of SPUR in November 2008, we have seen strong training commitment figures&nbsp;&ndash; as at end July 2010, some 259,000 workers have completed or are still undergoing SPUR training.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1291<p> Nevertheless, our commitment to help our workers continually upgrade their skills remains unchanged. Therefore, the Government will invest a total of $2.5 billion over the next five years on continuing education and training (CET). We will also continue to extend generous levels of support for course fees and absentee payroll for approved CET courses under the Skills Development Fund (SDF).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, employers will be able to leverage on more funded courses for Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) to broaden and deepen their skills. Currently, there are 300 PMET courses available and efforts are underway to roll out more courses and reach out to more PMETs when SPUR ends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) will also continue to expand the national CET system, and adopt more targeted measures to support the vision for capability and productivity driven growth. For example, the Workfare Training Support (WTS) scheme introduced in July 2010 encourages older low-wage workers to upgrade their skills through training, so that they can improve their employability, upgrade to better jobs and earn more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WTS provides employers of older low-wage workers with higher course fee and absentee payroll support[1] that are on par with or higher than SPUR if they send their workers for Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) training. Older low-wage workers will also receive higher course fee funding when they sign up for WSQ training at our CET Centres, and receive Training Commitment Awards if they sustain training over a one-year period.&nbsp; The Government will also increase the course fee tax relief for individuals from $3,500 to $5,500 with effect from Year of Assessment 2011.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I strongly encourage companies to support the training of their workers. Workers should also take the initiative to upgrade their skillsets. This is because it is important for us to continue to enhance our productivity and maintain our economic competitiveness.</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p>*Under WTS, employers who sponsor their employees (Singapore Citizens aged 35 and above, and earning up to $1,700 per month) for training will be eligible for up to 95% of course fee and absentee payroll support.</p><BR></div></P></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P>\t        <!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><p align=left>Column: 1293<p><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
