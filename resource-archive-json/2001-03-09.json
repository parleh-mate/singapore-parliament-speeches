[Mr Chay Wai Chuen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh asked\r\n\r\nabout the progress of the Asian IT Belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Internet revolution started around 1994 in USA.\r\n\r\nIn  the  first  five  years of the Internet  revolution,  the\r\n\r\nrevolution  was very much US-centric.  As a result,  USA  was\r\n\r\nable  to pull far ahead of the other regions of the world  in\r\n\r\nthis  IT  revolution.   The  European  community,  under  the\r\n\r\ncoordination of the European Commission, decided to come  out\r\n\r\nwith  a concerted response.  Last year, they launched the  e-Europe   Initiative.   Basically,  e-Europe  is  a  concerted\r\n\r\nresponse  from the European community to make  Europe  an  IT\r\n\r\npowerhouse   and  become  active  players  in   this   global\r\n\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Asia-Pacific, obviously we are not in any\r\n\r\nposition  to  do  so  because  the  Asian  economies  are  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  stages of development.  Also, we do  not  have  an\r\n\r\nAsian Commission to do this kind of coordination.  But having\r\n\r\nsaid  so,  it would still be highly desirable for some  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries and economies to find ways to work together so that\r\n\r\nwe  can pool our resources and expertise, so that Asia  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole  can  come out with the necessary response and  not  be\r\n\r\nleft  behind.   It  is  with this intention  that  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister suggested the idea of the Asian IT Belt.  The  whole\r\n\r\nintention is for some leading cities in Asia to link up  with\r\n\r\neach  other  and provide the backbone of the IT belt  in  the\r\n\r\nAsia-Pacific.  Over time, the other cities, as and when  they\r\n\r\nare ready, can join this IT Belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We envisage that this Asian IT Belt would comprise five\r\n\r\nmain  thrusts.   The first thrust is e-Infrastructure.   This\r\n\r\nwould include broadband connectivity as well as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe standardisation of e-business rules and regulations.  The\r\n\r\nsecond   thrust  is  e-Markets.   To  facilitate   the   mass\r\n\r\ndeployment of applications and services across Asia, we  need\r\n\r\nto  put  in place some standardisation.  For example, in  the\r\n\r\ncase of secured transaction, we need to implement PKI (Public\r\n\r\nKey  Infrastructure).   The third  area  is  e-Capital.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the flow of venture capital fund within  the  Asia-Pacific,  so  that  funding support  for  entrepreneurs  will\r\n\r\nbecome  more effective across Asia.  The fourth  area  is  e-Talent.  Basically, to work together on the development of IT\r\n\r\nmanpower,  and  facilitate freer flow of IT  manpower  across\r\n\r\ncities  within Asia.  And last, but not least, is the concept\r\n\r\nof  e-Ideas. Basically, it is for the Asian community to come\r\n\r\ntogether   to  work  together,  to  innovate  with   emerging\r\n\r\ntechnologies and come out with new ideas to exploit  the  new\r\n\r\npotential of IT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that by pursuing these five key thrusts, we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to create a more conducive environment  within\r\n\r\nAsia  to  facilitate the growth of e-commerce and e-business.\r\n\r\nOver  time,  we  hope this will serve as a  backbone  for  IT\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  Asia,  and that more  and  more  cities  and\r\n\r\ncountries  will  come on board.  We would  then  be  able  to\r\n\r\nrealise our vision of a Digital Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked what are the concrete plans to\r\n\r\nrealise  this vision.  Sir, this being a regional initiative,\r\n\r\nwhat  we  are doing now is to talk to like-minded  cities  to\r\n\r\npursue this vision.  Realistically speaking, we hope to start\r\n\r\nwith maybe three to five cities in Asia.  With these three to\r\n\r\nfive  cities, we can provide the first-cut backbone  for  the\r\n\r\nAsian IT Belt.  As I said, over time, maybe more cities  will\r\n\r\ncome  on board.  Working together, we can realise the  vision\r\n\r\nof a Digital Asia, hopefully sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, the Government\r\n\r\ncame  out  with  a World Class Land Transport  document  some\r\n\r\nyears  back  when it set forth its vision for  a  deliverable\r\n\r\nWorld Class Land Transport system for Singapore.

There should not be  any\r\n\r\nblockage,  otherwise our economy would suffer  great  losses,\r\n\r\nand our livelihood would be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance and results of the Land Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority  (LTA) since its establishment in 1995,  have  been\r\n\r\nvery commendable.

Right now, we have to review  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether we have effectively implemented the White Paper on  a\r\n\r\nWorld  Class  Land Transport network, including the  proposed\r\n\r\nSingapore Underground Road System (SURS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, more importantly, we should be able to move\r\n\r\nat  a  faster  pace to improve the public transport  for  our\r\n\r\npeople.   With  the completion of the airport extension  line\r\n\r\nand   the  North-East  line,  will  the  Government  consider\r\n\r\nextension  of  the rail network to link up the major  housing\r\n\r\nestates  in Singapore, so that these housing estates  can  be\r\n\r\nbetter  served  by  public transport?   Will  the  Government\r\n\r\nconsider  bringing  forward the plan to bring  LRT  to  other\r\n\r\nhousing  estates,  like  Sengkang and  Bukit  Panjang?    LTA\r\n\r\nshould  let  our people know by announcing  the schedule  and\r\n\r\nimplementation  plan for such a scheme  so  that  our  people\r\n\r\ncould plan for their future transport arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with greater efficiency and speed in the\r\n\r\nconstruction of public housing in new towns, I hope LTA  will\r\n\r\nalso  have  better  coordination with the relevant  agencies,\r\n\r\nlike HDB, URA and Ministry of Education.  Take Sengkang,  for\r\n\r\nexample.  Before the commission of the Sengkang East Road  on\r\n\r\n22nd January, the old Punggol Road was the only approach road\r\n\r\nto the new town.  This two-way narrow road had only two lanes\r\n\r\non either side, causing great inconvenience to the residents.\r\n\r\nThis  makes  us wonder if there is a lack of coordination  in\r\n\r\nthe  overall planning.  Because of earlier partial completion\r\n\r\nof  the  new town, the school has to start operating earlier.\r\n\r\nNan  Chiau  Primary School  was opened on 2nd  January.   But\r\n\r\nright  now,  buses  cannot stop by the  side  of  the  school\r\n\r\nbecause  the  bus stop has not been approved by the  relevant\r\n\r\nauthority.   Therefore,  we  can  see  there  is  a  lack  of\r\n\r\ncoordination  here.   I  hope  that  the  various  Government\r\n\r\nagencies can improve their coordination.  They cannot proceed\r\n\r\nby the original schedule.  They must be more flexible to take\r\n\r\ninto  account  the  development pace and  the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents  to  make  timely adjustment to  the  plan  through\r\n\r\nbetter coordination among the various agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of developments to the Hougang New Town,\r\n\r\nPunggol  Central  and  Punggol South.   But  right  now,  the\r\n\r\nresidents  still  need  to  wait  for  bus  services  to   be\r\n\r\nstrengthened in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, the Ministry has announced that\r\n\r\nthe  open  bidding for COE will start sometime in the  second\r\n\r\nquarter of this year.  Will the Minister inform the House why\r\n\r\nthere was this delay and what is the situation for the trials\r\n\r\nand launch of this open bidding for COE?  Given that this  is\r\n\r\nquite  a big system, there should be sufficient trials before\r\n\r\nthe  launch.   Singaporeans  are quite  intolerant  of  these\r\n\r\nglitches, especially in the area of COE, where everyone is an\r\n\r\nexpert and has something to contribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that there will be both closed and\r\n\r\nopen  bidding on alternate fortnight running parallel.  Given\r\n\r\nthat there will be disparity in the outcome of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  processes,  how  does  the  LTA  intend  to  manage  the\r\n\r\ndisparity in outcomes, or merge the processes in phases?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister also update the House on the new quota\r\n\r\nfor  the  new  year  and whether there  will  be  any  review\r\n\r\nmechanism to be considered?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, with the\r\n\r\nforthcoming introduction of open bidding, it may be timely to\r\n\r\nreconsider the bases of allocating COEs.  Currently, COEs are\r\n\r\nallocated  for the different categories.  For motor vehicles,\r\n\r\nthere  are category A for cars with engine capacity of up  to\r\n\r\n1600  cc; category B for cars with engine capacity above 1600\r\n\r\ncc; and category E, which is open and can be used to register\r\n\r\nany  type  of vehicle.  There used to be more categories  and\r\n\r\nallocations, unfortunately started on a historical basis, and\r\n\r\nhave  only  served  to perpetuate the historical  pattern  of\r\n\r\ndemand.  To some extent, collapsing the old categories I  and\r\n\r\nII  into  category  A has helped the situation.   There  were\r\n\r\ntimes  when  the prices of category I COEs, that is  for  the\r\n\r\nsmall  cars  of up to 1,000 cc, exceed that for  category  II\r\n\r\nCOEs  for cars with engine capacity between 1,001 cc and 1600\r\n\r\ncc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that bidding for COE in any category was\r\n\r\nopen  to  everyone.  There was no practical  way  of  keeping\r\n\r\ncategory I COEs only for those with a more modest budget.  On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, a limited supply of COEs in any category will\r\n\r\nresult  in  a higher pricing if the demand is there.   Having\r\n\r\ndifferent  categories  and varying supplies  make  the  whole\r\n\r\nprocess   of   understanding  how  the   COE   system   works\r\n\r\nunnecessarily complex.  It is not surprising that most people\r\n\r\nwould  gladly  leave  it  to the car dealers  to  handle  the\r\n\r\nbidding on their behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that the entire supply of COEs\r\n\r\navailable at each bidding be placed in a single pool.  People\r\n\r\nshould  just  bid for COEs from the pool.  In this  way,  the\r\n\r\nsupply  for  any category of cars would automatically  adjust\r\n\r\naccording to the demand for that bidding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having secured the COEs, there are two approaches. The\r\n\r\nfirst approach will require all successful bidders to pay the\r\n\r\nsame lowest successful price.  The second approach will adopt\r\n\r\nthe successful bid price, as that for registering Category  A\r\n\r\nvehicles,  and  the price for registering a  larger  capacity\r\n\r\nvehicle  would be on a multiple of this base price.  One  can\r\n\r\nmake a very strong case for either approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would suffice to simplify the system by pooling\r\n\r\nall  the COEs.  I believe it would lead to a more stable  COE\r\n\r\npricing  and also a simpler system would encourage people  to\r\n\r\ndo the bidding themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Minister to review the effectiveness of using  the\r\n\r\nCOE  system to regulate traffic flow on our roads.  The  cost\r\n\r\nof  owning cars in Singapore is extremely high as compared to\r\n\r\nthe   cost   of   owning  cars  in  most   other   countries.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  travel quite frequently nowadays and  they  are\r\n\r\nconscious of how costly it is to own cars in Singapore vis-a-vis  other  countries.  This can be attributed,  in  a  large\r\n\r\nmeasure,  to  the  artificial cost of having  to  pay  for  a\r\n\r\ncertificate to entitle them to own a car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COE prices fluctuate every month, sometimes, with huge\r\n\r\npendulum swings.  Such fluctuations impact buyers of new cars\r\n\r\nand  second-hand car sales.  Those who bought brand new  cars\r\n\r\nat  a  higher COE will find it financially not viable to sell\r\n\r\ntheir cars when the COE prices have dipped.  Second-hand cars\r\n\r\nthat are of a cheaper range are usually those at the tail end\r\n\r\nof the 10-year COE period.  In no time, such buyers will face\r\n\r\na  dilemma  of  having  to fork out  a  large  sum,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nprevailing premium to renew the COE for another 10 years,  or\r\n\r\nrenew  it  for five years, and scrapping the car  thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn  essence,  therefore, a car owner's COE dilemma  continues\r\n\r\neven after he has owned a car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, Sir, many Singaporeans, including our\r\n\r\naspiring younger generation, find it extremely difficult  and\r\n\r\ncomplicated  to own a car in an island that we want  them  to\r\n\r\ncall  our  home.  Singaporeans, especially those  with  young\r\n\r\nchildren  and  elderly parents, would like a more  convenient\r\n\r\nand  effective means of driving their infants,  children  and\r\n\r\nelderly  about  in  their  own cars  during  off-peak  hours.\r\n\r\nCheaper cars would also benefit retirees who are looking  for\r\n\r\ncheaper  or  second-hand cars without the fuss of  having  to\r\n\r\nfork out another sum of money for COE renewal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we can find a creative answer to help\r\n\r\nthem  achieve  this.   After all, notwithstanding  the  great\r\n\r\nimprovements in public transportation, the MRT and  buses  do\r\n\r\nnot  take the elderly and the children right to their  homes.\r\n\r\nAnd  at  certain times, at certain places, and peak hours  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, to catch a taxi would mean an intolerable  waiting\r\n\r\ntime.   Our main concern is to control the number of cars  on\r\n\r\nthe  roads,  especially  during  peak  hours,  owing  to  the\r\n\r\neconomic opportunity cost of road congestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewing from this standpoint, it becomes less relevant\r\n\r\nto  consider the number of cars owned by Singaporeans at  any\r\n\r\none  time.   If the number of cars on the roads  during  peak\r\n\r\nhours does matter, then we should implement measures to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  this rather than curtail car ownership.  Let the family\r\n\r\nbuy  cheaper  cars  and use them over the weekend.   Let  the\r\n\r\nretirees  buy cheaper cars with lesser COE renewal fuss,  and\r\n\r\nlet them use the cars during off-peak hours or periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the ERP system, we are harnessing technology to\r\n\r\nbetter control the flow of road traffic using the pay-as-you-drive  principle.   Let  there be less artificially  injected\r\n\r\ncosts  so  that more people can own cars and make  those  who\r\n\r\ndrive during peak periods pay more for the use of the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have implemented, modified and fine-tuned the\r\n\r\nCOE  system  over  many years.  With the advent  and  use  of\r\n\r\ntechnology that allows us to better control the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nflow of road traffic using the pay-as-you-drive principle,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  it  is time for us to review the  COE  system.\r\n\r\nHence,  I  would  like the Minister to enlighten  us  on  how\r\n\r\nuseful is the ERP system as a means to regulate the number of\r\n\r\nvehicles  on  the  road and whether his Ministry  intends  to\r\n\r\ngradually  phase  out  the  COE system,  thereby  making  car\r\n\r\nownership more affordable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Sir, I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  a  few  proposals in respect  of  the  COE  system.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  can the small car categories in the bidding  system\r\n\r\nbe  reinstated,  as the experiment to date is not  conclusive\r\n\r\nthat buyers of below 1,000 cc cars are better off?  Secondly,\r\n\r\ncan  the Minister consider allowing COE renewals for a  five-year period without having to scrap the car thereafter?  This\r\n\r\nwill  make it cheaper for car owners to continue owning their\r\n\r\ncars and for low-budget buyers in the second-hand market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> The principle behind offering COEs,\r\n\r\nthrough  a  bidding  system, is to  allow  market  forces  to\r\n\r\ndetermine   the   pricing  and,  indirectly,  influence   the\r\n\r\ndirection of COEs to those who need them most and are willing\r\n\r\nto pay the price.  The common practice of packaging COEs into\r\n\r\ncar  sales  has  distorted the mechanism  and  therefore  the\r\n\r\npricing  of COEs cannot be said to be influenced strictly  by\r\n\r\ndemand pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the package deals, COEs are subsidised. Instead of\r\n\r\nlowering  the prices of cars when the cost is down, a  dealer\r\n\r\nwill  prefer to subsidise the COE.  After all, a sale is  not\r\n\r\ncompleted until the buyer is able to register the car.   From\r\n\r\nthe  perspective  of the buyer, leaving it  all  to  the  car\r\n\r\ndealer in the package deal simplifies his life.  In addition,\r\n\r\nby  not lowering the car price and, instead, subsidising  the\r\n\r\nCOE,  the  buyer  is  greatly assisted in  obtaining  maximum\r\n\r\nfinancing of the purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, it would appear that the present arrangements\r\n\r\nwould benefit everybody.  I, for one, have always gone for  a\r\n\r\npackage deal and it is so convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  am  raising this subject as I believe that, in the  longer\r\n\r\nterm,  it would better serve the consumer if the process  for\r\n\r\ngaining  a COE is separated from that for purchasing  a  car.\r\n\r\nBy  breaking  up  the two functions, COE pricing  would  more\r\n\r\nclosely  reflect market demand.  Having obtained a  COE,  the\r\n\r\nconsumer  would then shop around for the best deal  in  town.\r\n\r\nSince the prices of cars will no longer include the price  of\r\n\r\na COE, consumers would be presented with a clearer picture of\r\n\r\nthe pricing and make better judgement on the deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with the information, such as the open market\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the car and the taxes that go with it, a  consumer\r\n\r\ncan gauge the amount of premium he has to pay in choosing one\r\n\r\ncar  over  another.  The present situation  allows  for  some\r\n\r\npackage  deals to cloud the judgement of the buyer.  In  many\r\n\r\ncases,  a  consumer  wrongly believes that  a  COE  has  been\r\n\r\nguaranteed only to find that he has to pay an additional  sum\r\n\r\nof  hard  earned  money to buy the car he has  committed  to.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of open bidding, it is time to consider\r\n\r\nmaking  this  change  and stop cars  from  being  sold  as  a\r\n\r\npackage,  which includes the COE.  Consumers are  now  better\r\n\r\nplaced to make informed judgement and allowing package  deals\r\n\r\nto flourish cannot be in the interest of consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, first, let me answer\r\n\r\nthe two cuts from Mr Chay Wai Chuen and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang  on\r\n\r\nworld  class  transport.  Sir, both Mr Chay and Mr  Yeo  have\r\n\r\nasked  for  an update on what has been achieved in the  White\r\n\r\nPaper so far.  Mr Yeo has also asked whether we can speed  up\r\n\r\nthe  expansion of the rail system and in fact whether we  can\r\n\r\nlink  up  the different housing estates with the rail network\r\n\r\nand  whether  we  are going to expand the LRT  to  the  other\r\n\r\nhousing  estates,  just as we have done  for  Bukit  Panjang,\r\n\r\nSengkang, and, later on, Punggol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first give an update on what we have\r\n\r\nachieved in the White Paper so far, as requested by both MPs.\r\n\r\nSir, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  sets out four initiatives.  These are,  namely,\r\n\r\nimproving  public transport, developing a comprehensive  road\r\n\r\nnetwork,  demand  management measures on car  and  integrated\r\n\r\ntransport and land use planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go through them briefly. Sir, the land transport\r\n\r\nsystem, the cornerstone of that system, is really our  public\r\n\r\ntransport system.  This is an area that we are focusing a lot\r\n\r\nof  our  resources on.  Our aim is to have an expanded  Rapid\r\n\r\nTransit System (RTS) such that it is comprehensive in network\r\n\r\ncoverage  and it is easily accessible.  Members  will  recall\r\n\r\nthat  in  the White Paper, we had envisaged a long-term  rail\r\n\r\nnetwork  of  160  km,  and when we say \"long  term\",  we  are\r\n\r\ntalking about 30 years.  At the time when the White Paper was\r\n\r\nprepared  in 1996, the rail network at that time  was  67  km\r\n\r\nlong.   Today,  I  am happy to inform Members  that  the  RTS\r\n\r\nnetwork  is  now 92 km long, ie, we are more than halfway  to\r\n\r\nthe long-term target.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On recent achievements, LTA completed the Bukit Panjang\r\n\r\nLRT  system in November 1999 and the Expo Station in  January\r\n\r\nthis  year.   In the next few years, we will be  opening  the\r\n\r\nNorth-East line, the Sengkang LRT, the Dover MRT Station, the\r\n\r\nChangi  Airport Extension, the Marina line, and  the  Punggol\r\n\r\nLRT  line.  Sir, the completion of all these projects by year\r\n\r\n2005 will bring the RTS network to a total of 146 km, ie,  we\r\n\r\nare about 90% to the long-term target by year 2005.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nanswer to Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, in effect, we are actually  very\r\n\r\nfar ahead of what was envisaged in the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the linkage to the other housing estates and\r\n\r\nwhether  we are going to expand the LRT to the other  housing\r\n\r\nestates as well, I would like to inform Members that  LTA  is\r\n\r\nactively  studying  the  other  rail  projects  and  we  will\r\n\r\nannounce  the  projects as and when they are  finalised.   In\r\n\r\nterms  of the LRT for the other housing estates, now that  we\r\n\r\nhave  one  operational in Bukit Panjang and we are  going  to\r\n\r\nhave the second operational very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsoon  next year in Sengkang, what LRT would like to do is  to\r\n\r\nstep  back  and  observe  how  well  these  two  systems  are\r\n\r\nperforming  and  how  do they compare  versus  the  bus-based\r\n\r\nsystem for housing estates.  The system is very expensive and\r\n\r\nit is prudent for us to make a review before deciding whether\r\n\r\nto  further expand the system to the other housing estates in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good news for Members is that, over the long\r\n\r\nterm, instead of the rail network of 160 km, we envisage that\r\n\r\nthe  long-term  network  will now stretch  540  km.   So,  in\r\n\r\neffect,  we  are  going to make the rail  network  the  basic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure for public transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of developing a comprehensive road network,\r\n\r\nagain, LTA has managed to proceed ahead of what was envisaged\r\n\r\nin the White Paper.  By the end of last year, LTA had already\r\n\r\nadded 415-lane-km of roads.  This is much higher than the 225-lane-km targetted by the end of 2001, as set out in the White\r\n\r\nPaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of demand management measures, as you\r\n\r\nknow,  we  have  implemented ERP, as proposed  in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.   It  is working very well and it is able  to  control\r\n\r\ncongestion  on the major roads.  And because ERP  is  working\r\n\r\nvery well, we do not need to expand the ERP system beyond the\r\n\r\ncurrent gantries.  However, if the congestion does worsen  as\r\n\r\nthe  vehicle  population  grows, then  ERP  may  have  to  be\r\n\r\nexpanded to cover other areas and other parts of Singapore as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vehicle quota system (VQS) has indeed been\r\n\r\nhelpful in keeping the car population down.  Just now two MPs\r\n\r\nraised points about the VQS.  I will reply to that later on.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last pillar of the White Paper was the\r\n\r\nintegrated  transport and land use planning.   Here,  LTA  is\r\n\r\nworking very closely with URA and HDB on integrating land use\r\n\r\nin terms of town and transport planning.  This will enable us\r\n\r\nto optimise the use of our land and to maximise the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbenefits of the integrated land transport system to consumers\r\n\r\nand  to  residents.  As an example of the collaboration  with\r\n\r\nURA  and HDB, the hon. Member for Sengkang would realise that\r\n\r\nwe  are seeing there the integration, in terms of the use  of\r\n\r\nthe  MRT  and  LRT  stations  together  with  the  commercial\r\n\r\noperations, which will make the town a lot more attractive as\r\n\r\nwell.    The   other   example  of  the  building-cum-station\r\n\r\nintegrated development is the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station,  which\r\n\r\nshould be open very shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we can say that LTA has, indeed,\r\n\r\nmade  good  progress in the five years since the White  Paper\r\n\r\nwas released, and we are on track to developing a world-class\r\n\r\nland transport system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked about the coordination\r\n\r\namongst  LTA  and  other agencies.  I understand  that  point\r\n\r\nwould  be  brought  up again later, and we will  answer  that\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have four Members talking on COE. Let me reply\r\n\r\nto them one at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Chay asked about open COE: why the delay, when\r\n\r\nwill  it  be  launched, and whether there will be  sufficient\r\n\r\ntrials  because the public will not tolerate any glitches  to\r\n\r\nthe  system.  He has also asked for information  on  the  new\r\n\r\nCOEs  for  the next quota year (QY).  I will go  through  his\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the delay to the open COE system? Sir, the online\r\n\r\nCOE  bidding  system that is being worked on at  the  present\r\n\r\nmoment is a very complex system.  As such, the contractor has\r\n\r\nhad to spend a little bit more time than originally envisaged\r\n\r\nto  make  sure that the different elements of the system  are\r\n\r\nwell designed, and the software is written up properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the contractor has, in fact, completed the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the various components of the system.  What is\r\n\r\nhappening now is that LTA and the contractor are carrying out\r\n\r\na series of very comprehensive tests on the system.  This is,\r\n\r\nas  Mr  Chay  had pointed out, to ensure that the  system  is\r\n\r\ntotally debugged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore we launch it to the public.  We expect to complete the\r\n\r\ntests by the second quarter of this year.  If everything goes\r\n\r\nfine  with the tests, we should be able to see the  open  COE\r\n\r\nsystem being launched around June or July this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the system is launched, we will introduce it on a\r\n\r\ntrial  basis  and, during the trial, as Mr Chay  had  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  we are going to alternate between the open COE and  the\r\n\r\npresent closed COE bidding system.  The bidding will be  done\r\n\r\nevery  fortnightly.  What we will do is we would then  divide\r\n\r\nthat  month's COE into two portions:  one half for  the  open\r\n\r\nCOE  bidding and, a fortnight later, the other half, for  the\r\n\r\nclosed  COE bidding system.  As the two bidding systems  will\r\n\r\nhave  different  characteristics, it is quite  possible  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  also  have  quite different  outcomes.   We  will\r\n\r\nevaluate the outcomes from the two bidding systems during the\r\n\r\ntrial  period,  and  correct any  shortcomings  that  may  be\r\n\r\nobserved   with  the  new  open  bidding  system.  LTA   will\r\n\r\ndiscontinue  the closed bidding system once the open  bidding\r\n\r\nsystem  has  stabilised, and the public  is  comfortable  and\r\n\r\nfamiliar with the new system.  We expect the trial period  to\r\n\r\nlast between six to twelve months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the new COE supply for the new quota year,\r\n\r\nSir,  Members will be happy to know that the Government  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  allow  for  a 3% growth  rate  in  our  vehicle\r\n\r\npopulation   for  the  new  quota  year.   Based   on   LTA's\r\n\r\ncomputations, the COE quota for QY2001 will be 86,831.   This\r\n\r\nis  about  20% lower than for QY2000, but it is  much  higher\r\n\r\nthan  the  quota for the previous years.  As an example,  the\r\n\r\nCOE  quota  for  QY2001 is 27% higher than the QY1999  quota.\r\n\r\nLTA  will  be  releasing more details  of  the  annual  quota\r\n\r\nshortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee has proposed that we come up with a single\r\n\r\npool  of  COEs, and he has given two options, if  we  have  a\r\n\r\nsingle  pool.  One, let all the bidders pay the  same  price,\r\n\r\nor,  two,  let them bid but use a multiplier to differentiate\r\n\r\nbetween the different engine sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, this issue of whether to have a single\r\n\r\npool  of  COEs is not a new one.  The GPC had very  carefully\r\n\r\nconsidered  this  question when reviewing the  Vehicle  Quota\r\n\r\nSystem  in  1999.  It is fair to state that, from the  public\r\n\r\ntransport  point of view, having one category  of  COEs  does\r\n\r\nmake  for  efficient  allocation.   Basically,  what  we  are\r\n\r\ninterested in is:  how many vehicles are we going to have  on\r\n\r\nthe  road, and whether the vehicle has a bigger engine  or  a\r\n\r\nsmaller  engine.   In terms of road use, it does  not  really\r\n\r\nmake much difference.  In terms of efficiency, what Mr Gerard\r\n\r\nEe  has mentioned is correct.  However, the feedback from the\r\n\r\npublic  was  that some segmentation of the COE  quota  system\r\n\r\nwould  be  useful for social equity reasons  because  of  the\r\n\r\nconcern  that  if  we  do not have separate  categories,  the\r\n\r\npotential  buyers of small cars may be squeezed  out  by  the\r\n\r\nbuyers  of the bigger and more expensive cars.  As such,  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  recommended that, as a first step, we  proceed  to\r\n\r\nonly merge the car COE categories from four to two, which  is\r\n\r\nwhat we have today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of whether we should have a single pool, but\r\n\r\nstill  differentiate by having a multiplier,  the  complexity\r\n\r\nthat  is  going to be introduced is not going to make anybody\r\n\r\nany  happier.   How do we allocate the multiplier?   Whatever\r\n\r\nfigure we pluck out from the air is not going to make anybody\r\n\r\nhappy  at  all.   So, I think the present system  is  working\r\n\r\nwell.   We  only  have the two categories for  vehicles  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, it is working.  I think it is better that we stick\r\n\r\nto  it.  Let us have the open COE bidding first, see how that\r\n\r\ngoes and, if the indications are that it makes sense later on\r\n\r\nto  have a single category, I am sure the Government will  be\r\n\r\nvery happy to consider that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his point that having the different categories, in\r\n\r\neffect,  fit  the  relative size of  each  sector,  based  on\r\n\r\nhistorical  figures, I think Mr Ee need not worry about  that\r\n\r\nbecause  we have thought about it.  That is why we  have  the\r\n\r\nopen  COE category: so that if there are more buyers  bidding\r\n\r\nfor small cars, for example, instead of all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing  for  the  small car category and bidding  up  the  COE\r\n\r\nprices,  they can still go into the open COE market  and  bid\r\n\r\nfor  the  open  COEs.   So  there is a balancing-tank  effect\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong lamented about the high cost of car\r\n\r\nownership in Singapore.  Sir, I think it is useful for us  to\r\n\r\ntake  a  step  back  and see whether we should  be  comparing\r\n\r\nourselves with countries which do not have space constraints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the reason why we need to have a very\r\n\r\nstrong  control on car population is that we are  land-short.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  we  should be comparing ourselves with  the  major\r\n\r\ncities of the world, like New York.  Very few people who live\r\n\r\nand  work  in  New  York expect to own a car,  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nreally is a major city.  We do not have the open spaces where\r\n\r\nwe  can  have  a half-an-acre home and park 10  cars  in  the\r\n\r\ndriveway.    Unfortunately,  in  Singapore,   there   is   no\r\n\r\nalternative  to  having  controls  over  the  car  population\r\n\r\nbecause we have very limited land for roads and we have  very\r\n\r\nlimited  land for parking cars.  In fact, roads today already\r\n\r\ntake  up  12% of our total land space, and this is equivalent\r\n\r\nto  the total land area used for residential housing.  So  we\r\n\r\nare already using whatever land we have for roads, and it  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be very difficult to build a lot more roads.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  going to be very difficult to build much more car parks\r\n\r\nin existing housing estates.  If we look at the older housing\r\n\r\nestates like Toa Payoh, Queenstown, etc, the parking capacity\r\n\r\nis  already  very, very tight.  So we must control  both  car\r\n\r\nownership as well as car usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I think Mr Noris Ong made an interesting point.\r\n\r\nHe  is  asking us to reinstate the category for  small  cars.\r\n\r\nThis is in contrast to what Mr Gerard Ee has asked for, which\r\n\r\nis  to  merge everything into one category.  This shows that,\r\n\r\nreally,  the  issue  of car ownership and  usage  is  a  very\r\n\r\ncomplex one, and we will have to try to balance all interests\r\n\r\nas much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has also asked that we make it possible for car\r\n\r\nowners who want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrevalidate  their COEs to do it on a five-year  basis  rather\r\n\r\nthan  on  a  10-year basis.  This issue was  again  discussed\r\n\r\nquite extensively previously, and the reason for having  that\r\n\r\n10-year COE is, again, an equity reason, because the new  car\r\n\r\nbuyers are buying COEs on a 10-year basis and, therefore, the\r\n\r\nlifetime of each COE is really for a 10-year period.  And  if\r\n\r\na  car owner feels that his car has been very well maintained\r\n\r\nand can last another 10 years, he is free to revalidate for a\r\n\r\nfull  10 years.  In fact, he can do it indefinitely, as  long\r\n\r\nas  the  car  is  well maintained.  But we do recognise  that\r\n\r\nthere  will be other owners who do not feel that the car  can\r\n\r\nlast  10  years and therefore, we have made it  possible  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  have a final revalidation of the COE for  a  5-year\r\n\r\nperiod,  ie,  this  5-year period  is  not  meant  to  be  an\r\n\r\ninstalment  payment scheme.  We should leave  the  instalment\r\n\r\npayment scheme to the financing agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee also touched on the point of package deals\r\n\r\nfor  COEs.   He  himself  recognises that  this  package-deal\r\n\r\nsystem is actually a very convenient one and, in fact, it  is\r\n\r\none that the vast majority of car buyers use, and for all the\r\n\r\nreasons  that Mr Ee has mentioned.  The question is:   should\r\n\r\nwe  now  step in and disallow the packaging of the car prices\r\n\r\nwith  the  price  of  a  COE?  This  would  be  unnecessarily\r\n\r\nintervening in the free market mechanism.  As Mr  Ee  has  in\r\n\r\nfact recognised, the package pricing of the car with COE,  in\r\n\r\neffect, results in a discount being given by the dealers.  He\r\n\r\nused  the  term \"subsidise\". I would rather not use the  term\r\n\r\n\"subsidise\"  because I do not think car dealers  are  in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  subsidising car buyers.  But  they  do  give  a\r\n\r\ndiscount to make it more attractive for the car buyers to buy\r\n\r\nthe car from them with the COE included.  And I think that is\r\n\r\nto the benefit of the car buyer but there is a hidden cost to\r\n\r\nit.  And again, that is something which Mr Ee has alluded to,\r\n\r\nand  the  hidden cost is that the buyer has no  control  over\r\n\r\nwhat the car dealer is going to bid for the COE, and over the\r\n\r\ntiming of the delivery of the car that he has entered into an\r\n\r\nagreement to buy.  So there is a hidden cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in a way, the buyer who buys his own COE  is,  in\r\n\r\neffect,  forgoing the discount but, in return, he is  getting\r\n\r\nthe  assured  delivery of the car he wants, at  the  time  he\r\n\r\nwants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think what we need to do is to encourage the car\r\n\r\nmarket  to  be more competitive so that car buyers  can  shop\r\n\r\naround and know what they are actually buying.  To this  end,\r\n\r\nLTA  has done two things.  One is that it has made it  easier\r\n\r\nfor individuals, companies and car dealers to parallel import\r\n\r\nthe  cars  that  they want.  I have asked LTA to  review  and\r\n\r\nfurther   streamline   the  import  procedures   to   further\r\n\r\nfacilitate  parallel car imports.  Of course, the  cars  that\r\n\r\nare  being  parallel imported must still meet our safety  and\r\n\r\nenvironmental standards and regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part that LTA is doing, and would be doing\r\n\r\nmore,  is to post every month on its website full details  of\r\n\r\nthe car prices, and this would include the OMV, customs duty,\r\n\r\nARF  and  COE  payable, ie, car buyers can then go  into  the\r\n\r\nwebsite and know exactly what he has paid for versus what  it\r\n\r\nactually  costs  the  car dealer.   They  can  then  make  an\r\n\r\ninformed choice as to what to buy and whether to buy with  or\r\n\r\nwithout COE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, the North-East line which is\r\n\r\ncurrently  being  built is going to be a driver-less  system.\r\n\r\nConsidering  the  several mishaps that have occurred  in  the\r\n\r\ndriver-less  LRT,  I  would like to  ask  the  Minister  what\r\n\r\nsafeguards or preventive measures are undertaken so that  the\r\n\r\ndriver-less  North-East line which travels at a  much  faster\r\n\r\nspeed and with heavier loads will be assuredly safe. Although\r\n\r\nthe  trains are driver-less, I assume that the control centre\r\n\r\nis  hopefully  not controlled by robots.  Will  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nensure  that  people who run the control room  have  actually\r\n\r\ndone  stints  on the ground so that they are experienced  and\r\n\r\nknow  the  limitations on the ground when they make decisions\r\n\r\non the screen?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I would like to cover is whether there\r\n\r\nwill be fare linking and seamless transfers between the North-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEast  line and the MRT in order to minimise inconvenience  to\r\n\r\ntravellers  even though this would be operated  by  different\r\n\r\ncompanies.   This  implies  that there  will  have  to  be  a\r\n\r\nmechanism   for  fare  staging  electronically  between   the\r\n\r\ndifferent operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I would rather call the North-East line not driver-less but an automated system. There is\r\n\r\na  difference between driver-less and automated.  \"Automated\"\r\n\r\nmeans that there is still someone in control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay has asked how safe would the system be and\r\n\r\nwhether the control room would be manned by people or  robots\r\n\r\nand  how  well they are going to be trained and, in terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  fare system, how integrated would that be with the  rest\r\n\r\nof the public transport system.  Let me take them in turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of safety, I think that really was a\r\n\r\nfundamental  concern  of LTA and the Ministry  when  we  were\r\n\r\nconsidering  the North-East line because safety  must  be  of\r\n\r\nparamount concern.  The safety system for the North-East line\r\n\r\nhas  been  designed  to  the  highest  international  railway\r\n\r\nstandards.  That I can assure the Members here.  LTA  started\r\n\r\non  the  design of the North-East line by adopting  the  best\r\n\r\nexisting features of the established fully automated  systems\r\n\r\nelsewhere  in  the  world.  Then they  proceeded  to  further\r\n\r\nenhance  the  design by incorporating the  latest  technology\r\n\r\nthat  is  available  today.  LTA has  also  established  very\r\n\r\nstrict  criteria  for hazard evaluation to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nsystem is safe for commuters.  Furthermore, they proceeded to\r\n\r\nbring in independent consultants to audit the design and  the\r\n\r\nconstruction.  They have gone through many steps to make sure\r\n\r\nthat in the design and construction stages, safety is kept at\r\n\r\nthe forefront of everybody's attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the heart of the North-East line safety system is\r\n\r\nthe   automatic  train  protection  system.   What  is   this\r\n\r\nautomatic train protection system?  Essentially, this  system\r\n\r\ndevelops an electronic envelope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naround  each  train,  and  it ensures  safe  speed  and  safe\r\n\r\ndistance  between each train.  The system uses  the  positive\r\n\r\ncontact between the steel wheels and the rails of each train,\r\n\r\nand  on  each train, there are 24 axles, which means on  each\r\n\r\ntrain,  there are 24 systems for feeding back to the  control\r\n\r\nroom  as to where the train is.  It is unlikely that  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to lose touch with the train.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, there is another independent system that\r\n\r\nhelps  to locate the train, that is, on the rails, there  are\r\n\r\nsensors.   And  as  the train passes each of  these  sensors,\r\n\r\nthere  will be an automatic pick-up which would again be  fed\r\n\r\nback  to the control system through antennas.  It is  a  dual\r\n\r\nchannel feedback system, a dual sensor type of system.  There\r\n\r\nare  also several levels of redundancies to safeguard against\r\n\r\nfailure.   The  train  is also equipped with  self-diagnostic\r\n\r\nsystem  which  allows  the train to continually  monitor  the\r\n\r\nhealth status of the equipment and the functions on board the\r\n\r\ntrain.   For  example, if on any of the  axles,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nfault,  that  fault would be picked up and fed  back  to  the\r\n\r\ncontrol system, ie, we are not going to get to a stage  where\r\n\r\nall  the 24 have failed before we find out.  So there  are  a\r\n\r\nlot of redundancies available in the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of implementation, LTA would put the entire\r\n\r\nNorth-East  line  system through several months  of  rigorous\r\n\r\nintegrated system and operational testing before  we  put  it\r\n\r\ninto  revenue service.  This is to make sure that the  design\r\n\r\nwork  has  been  carried out properly.  We  do  construct  it\r\n\r\nproperly, and we audit it, but there is nothing like  putting\r\n\r\nthe  system through a stress test.  We are going to  put  the\r\n\r\nsystem through several months of stress testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the control room, I am happy to tell Mr Chay\r\n\r\nthat there will be human controllers in the control room  and\r\n\r\nthey would be all cross-trained and  multi-skilled, including\r\n\r\nthe   train operation.  They are going to be put through  the\r\n\r\nvarious functions, they are going to be involved in the train\r\n\r\noperation  and  they  are going to have the  full  experience\r\n\r\nnecessary to run the control room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also happy to inform Mr Chay that the North-East line would be an integral part of the rapid transit\r\n\r\nnetwork and it will have the same ticketing system.  In  this\r\n\r\nway,  travellers would not have to leave the North-East  line\r\n\r\ntrain  system and go out and then come back to join the other\r\n\r\nparts of the system.  It is going to be a seamless travel for\r\n\r\ntravellers  on the North-East line.  I hope that answers  all\r\n\r\nhis questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why should the present duopoly system on bus\r\n\r\noperations  be  maintained?  That is  a  pertinent  question.\r\n\r\nCould  an additional player make bus services more efficient?\r\n\r\nI  feel  that  there  is  room for another  bus  operator  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a few good reasons why a third bus\r\n\r\noperator  should be encouraged. First, the commuter's  travel\r\n\r\ntime could be reduced with better realignment of routes.  The\r\n\r\nmore  frequent changeover between feeder bus system and  from\r\n\r\nfeeder  bus  system  to  MRT  could  be  avoided  and  better\r\n\r\nreorganised. This would, in a way, help commuters to  get  to\r\n\r\ntheir  destination on time. The second reason is  that  about\r\n\r\n40% of the commuters travel by bus or by bus and MRT.  It  is\r\n\r\nexpected  that  the MRT-bus type of commuters  are  going  to\r\n\r\nincrease  dramatically in future as more new  towns  will  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  and there will be more commuters travelling in bus  as\r\n\r\nwell as MRT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, with an additional bus operator, the present two\r\n\r\nbus  companies  would be pushed to become more efficient  and\r\n\r\ncost-effective.  That, I think, prevents these two  companies\r\n\r\nto  monopolise the routes that have been carved  out  between\r\n\r\nthe  two  companies.   We can change the  present  status  by\r\n\r\nallowing  Comfort  Holdings or others to participate  as  the\r\n\r\nthird  operator.  The question is whether the Ministry  would\r\n\r\nwant  to  change  its mindset and think  of  a  more  dynamic\r\n\r\npolicy.   The issue is that if you are looking for excellence\r\n\r\nin  a  world-class transport system, why not  look  at  these\r\n\r\nissues more closely?  The question is whether the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommuters would eventually benefit from this exercise  and  I\r\n\r\nthink they will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can anticipate that the Ministry's answer will be:\r\n\r\ntwo  is  enough.  My answer to this whole question  will  be:\r\n\r\nthree or more, if we decide in the interest of the commuters.\r\n\r\nI  hope they do not stick to the old population policy  style\r\n\r\nthat two is enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land transportation has an important impact on the\r\n\r\neveryday  life  of  Singaporeans.  Through a  combination  of\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  vehicular  growth,  managing  vehicular   usage,\r\n\r\nprovision of public transportation system and a good  island-wide  network,  the  land transport situation  has  generally\r\n\r\nserved Singaporeans well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have a good island-wide land transport system,\r\n\r\nthe  same  cannot  be said of the intra-town  land  transport\r\n\r\nsystem,  especially  in new estates.   In  new  estates,  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  a  comprehensive  land  transport  plan   is\r\n\r\nessential   to   reduce  travelling  time,  prevent   traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion  and improve road safety. Sengkang  New  Town  was\r\n\r\ntouted  as being the first town where the entire road network\r\n\r\nand  the  land transport system was pre-planned.   It  is  an\r\n\r\nexample of faultless planning but flawed execution.  Planning\r\n\r\nthe   land   transport  system  is  only  the   first   step.\r\n\r\nImplementing  the  plan  is a more difficult  task.   Success\r\n\r\nrequires   close  coordination  between  various   Government\r\n\r\nagencies,  including the planners, LTA and URA, the builders,\r\n\r\nHDB and LTA, and the public transport service providers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the plan was near faultless, the same cannot be\r\n\r\nsaid  of the execution.  The first year of living in Sengkang\r\n\r\nTown  was  a nightmare.  What was inconceivable was that  the\r\n\r\nentry  and  exit to the entire town was via the  old  Punggol\r\n\r\nRoad  with its limited width.  As the town grew, I was aghast\r\n\r\nthat  the  road  network  fell far  behind  in  its  pace  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment. With the time taken to leave the town, taking as\r\n\r\nlong as half an hour, it was becoming unbearable.  This would\r\n\r\nbe the same if you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimagine  that  all the Ang Mo Kio Town residents  could  only\r\n\r\nenter  and exit the town via Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, or  if  all\r\n\r\nthe  residents in Tampines could only enter or exit the  town\r\n\r\nthrough Avenue 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These concerns were raised with the various Ministries,\r\n\r\nand  I must be thankful that with the support of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  National  Development and MCIT, we formed a committee  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  development of the town.  It has been  a  very\r\n\r\nenriching  experience,  not only  for  us  but  for  all  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies that have been involved in the  work  of\r\n\r\nthis committee.  And it shows that a lot of fine coordination\r\n\r\nis  required  for execution of even the best of plans.   With\r\n\r\nthe support from the Ministry of National Development and the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Communications and Information Technology,  bus\r\n\r\nservices  were  added  to provide an  alternative,  and  road\r\n\r\ndevelopment was speeded up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, another major trunk road was\r\n\r\nopened,  one year ahead of time.  For this, I have  to  thank\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for responding to our appeals.  This has  eased\r\n\r\nthe  traffic woes but not solved it.  The MRT and LRT  lines,\r\n\r\nwhich  are due for completion, will also reduce some of these\r\n\r\ntraffic woes.  However, the problem remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punggol Road remains the main life line of Sengkang\r\n\r\nTown.   It  is also the link to Tampines Expressway.   Almost\r\n\r\ndaily,  during peak hours, you can see traffic  tailing  back\r\n\r\ninto  the  Expressway from the slip roads into Punggol  Road.\r\n\r\nIf  you think this was bad, the worst is yet to come, as  the\r\n\r\nhighly  touted town of the future, Punggol 21 or Punggol  New\r\n\r\nTown  has  also  one arterial life line, and  no  prizes  for\r\n\r\nguessing the right answer.  Yes, it is again our old  Punggol\r\n\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As blocks of flats in Punggol New Town sprout out\r\n\r\nquickly, more people will share the nightmare of the Sengkang\r\n\r\nresidents.  I am no town planner, but what surprised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nme  is  that  no one thought much of it.  When Sengkang  Town\r\n\r\ngrew  to  half  the  size of Ang Mo Kio  Town,  the  planners\r\n\r\nassumed  that  an old arterial road would not only  meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the  new  town but would also  be  sufficient  for\r\n\r\nanother new town as well.  I think that the Ministry needs to\r\n\r\nreact  quickly.  New entry and exit roads need to be  opened.\r\n\r\nBuilding of new expressway entry and exit points for  Punggol\r\n\r\nand  Sengkang  New Towns need to be accelerated.   Additional\r\n\r\nflyovers linking Punggol New Town to Sengkang New Town across\r\n\r\nthe TPE must be built to give the town a new life line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living in Punggol New Town is rather precarious\r\n\r\npresently.   Can  you imagine this  -   all  it  takes  is  a\r\n\r\ntraffic accident or a vehicular breakdown along Punggol  Road\r\n\r\nto  prevent  entry or exit from the new town?  An entire  new\r\n\r\ntown  with one single entry and exit, and yes we are  talking\r\n\r\nabout  Punggol  21.   I  urge  the  Minister  to  consider  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive review of the road network development schedule\r\n\r\nin  Sengkang and Punggol New Towns to ensure that  they  will\r\n\r\nmeasure up to the claims that these are towns with ideal land\r\n\r\ntransport plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Goh Chee Wee is not here. Dr John\r\n\r\nChen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun):</b> Sir, I thank Members\r\n\r\nfor  their  questions.  Dr Vasoo asked  whether  the  present\r\n\r\nduopoly  system in our public transport is good  enough,  and\r\n\r\nwhether  we  can  have another operator to compete  with  the\r\n\r\nexisting two operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have two existing companies providing public\r\n\r\nscheduled  bus services throughout Singapore.  Between  them,\r\n\r\nthey  are  required  to cover most parts of   Singapore,  and\r\n\r\ncover both the profitable as well as the unprofitable routes.\r\n\r\nThe  current  industry  structure has  allowed  the  two  bus\r\n\r\noperators   to   provide  a  generally   high   quality   and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  bus service, with affordable fares.    How  is\r\n\r\nthis achieved?  This is achieved through the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Transport Council (PTC) requiring the bus operators to\r\n\r\nmeet  a set of quality standards, including service coverage,\r\n\r\nfrequencies,  operating hours and other aspects of  operation\r\n\r\nto  safeguard  commuters'  interest,  even  for  unprofitable\r\n\r\nroutes.    This  is  what  we  call  the  universal   service\r\n\r\nobligation  (USO) that the bus companies have to meet.   This\r\n\r\nUSO  is  not without cost to the bus operators, and therefore\r\n\r\nGovernment  needs  to  consider very  carefully  whether  the\r\n\r\nindustry can sustain more operators.  Because, as it is,  the\r\n\r\nbus  operators have to service the non-profitable routes, and\r\n\r\ntherefore they are, in a way, cross subsidising.  If we allow\r\n\r\nanother operator to come in, we have to consider whether that\r\n\r\noperator would also have universal service obligation, and if\r\n\r\nthey  do  not have USO, then will it be fair to the  existing\r\n\r\noperators?  And if you allow the new operator to cherry  pick\r\n\r\nthe  profitable  routes, then the viability of  the  existing\r\n\r\noperators may be in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, there is already some form of competition\r\n\r\nbetween the two operators by way of the PTC benchmarking them\r\n\r\nagainst  each other for service levels. If we were  to  allow\r\n\r\nunfettered  competition  in the  bus  market,  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nunfettered  competition can lead to unprofitable  routes  not\r\n\r\nbeing served, and a decline in viability for all the players.\r\n\r\nAnd the end result can be a decline in service standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I agree with Dr Vasoo that we should\r\n\r\nincrease competition where appropriate.  In this regard, some\r\n\r\nsteps were taken last year to introduce more competition into\r\n\r\nthe  industry.  For instance, the PTC called an  open  tender\r\n\r\nlast  year  to select the operator who could offer  the  most\r\n\r\ncompetitive fares for providing public bus services to Jurong\r\n\r\nIsland.   The  PTC  also  invited  both  private  and  public\r\n\r\ntransport operators to submit proposals for introducing  more\r\n\r\nnight  bus  services.  We can do more along these  lines,  if\r\n\r\nthere  is demand for such services.  In fact, there are other\r\n\r\nareas  where  we  allow competition.  For instance,  we  have\r\n\r\nScheme B bus services plying along certain trunk routes,  and\r\n\r\nthis was in response to complaints that these busy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nroutes   were  not  adequately  served.   We  have  therefore\r\n\r\nintroduced Scheme B bus services in order to provide a higher\r\n\r\nlevel  of service.  So, if there is any complaint about  poor\r\n\r\nservices, we will get the PTC to closely monitor those routes\r\n\r\nand  tighten  the  standards, if necessary, or  maybe  invite\r\n\r\nanother  operator  to service those areas,  if  the  existing\r\n\r\noperator cannot meet these standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Michael Lim questioned the implementation of the\r\n\r\nroad  network  in  Sengkang.   Earlier,  Mr  Yeo  Guat  Kwang\r\n\r\ncomplained   about  the  coordination  problem  between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies.   Yes, today,  there  is  a  system  of\r\n\r\ncoordination between LTA, HDB and other agencies involved  in\r\n\r\nnew town development.  And roads, for instance, are built  in\r\n\r\ntandem  with  the  development of a town.   In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nSengkang,  however,  I  do agree with  the  Member  that  the\r\n\r\ncoordination  did  not work as well as it  should.   The  key\r\n\r\nreason for this is that the ongoing construction of the North\r\n\r\nEast  MRT  line  and the LRT system has hampered  the  speedy\r\n\r\nconstruction of some major internal roads in Sengkang, giving\r\n\r\nrise  to  inconvenience to residents, and the  situation  was\r\n\r\naggravated by the rapid growth of Sengkang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim also mentioned that the exit and entry\r\n\r\nroads of the town via the Expressway are inadequate.  Because\r\n\r\nof  the problems that the Member has fed back, LTA has worked\r\n\r\nclosely with the MP and grassroots organisations to solve the\r\n\r\nproblem.   And with the stepping up of this effort,  we  have\r\n\r\nopened up some of these roads ahead of schedule, as mentioned\r\n\r\nby  Dr Michael Lim.  For instance, we have opened up Sengkang\r\n\r\nEast  Way,  which was originally scheduled to open after  the\r\n\r\ncompletion of the underground construction works in June this\r\n\r\nyear.   This was completed ahead of schedule in January  last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sengkang East Road was also opened in January this year,\r\n\r\nas  mentioned by Dr Michael Lim, almost a year ahead  of  the\r\n\r\noriginal  schedule  in end 2001.  And  with  the  opening  of\r\n\r\nSengkang East Road,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  is another exit and entry point for Sengkang town  via\r\n\r\nthe  CTE.   I  will  continue to press LTA to  come  up  with\r\n\r\nsolutions to alleviate the congestion in Sengkang, even while\r\n\r\nconstruction works are ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Punggol, LTA will be building two more fringe roads.\r\n\r\nThis  is  in addition to the internal road network  that  HDB\r\n\r\nwill build in tandem with the town development.  One of these\r\n\r\ntwo  roads  is  the  interchange at the  Tampines  Expressway\r\n\r\nconnecting  Sengkang  East Road,  and  this  will  serve  the\r\n\r\nconnection between Punggol Town and TPE, as well as  Sengkang\r\n\r\nTown and TPE.  LTA will also build another flyover across TPE\r\n\r\nconnecting  Punggol Town and Sengkang Town.   I believe  work\r\n\r\nwill start in March this year and it should be ready in 2003.\r\n\r\nSo this will serve to improve the road network in the two new\r\n\r\ntowns,   as   well  as  connecting  them  to   the   existing\r\n\r\nexpressways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by assuring Dr Lim and Mr Yeo that LTA\r\n\r\nwill continue to work closely with HDB in developing the road\r\n\r\nnetwork  to serve the needs of residents moving into  Punggol\r\n\r\nTown  and  ensure that the problems encountered  in  Sengkang\r\n\r\nwill not be repeated in Punggol Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I would like to seek a clarification from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of State as to why we are so keen in protecting\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  these two bus companies  which  have  made\r\n\r\nrespectable  profits.  He has mentioned  that  other  private\r\n\r\noperators have come in to tender for routes.

We  also  need  to  provide\r\n\r\ntransport  to  virtually every household in  Singapore.

The best  way  to\r\n\r\nensure  all  of these is to have dual monopolies  where  each\r\n\r\nmonopoly  is  given both profitable and unprofitable  routes.\r\n\r\nThis is the existing structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we introduce new operators, we have to look at the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  areas that are not properly served.  If  they  are\r\n\r\nproperly served, and if we were to allow another operator  to\r\n\r\ncome  and  cream  off the profit of those profitable  routes,\r\n\r\nthen  it would make the existing operators less viable.  Then\r\n\r\nperhaps  fares will have to be adjusted because if  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  viable, in the end, the service level will be  affected.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  rationale  for having  this  existing  duopoly\r\n\r\nsystem.   In fact, in many parts of the world, we do not  see\r\n\r\nbus operations having free competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, one of the\r\n\r\nmost  familiar  types  of  visitors  to  the  meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsessions  is the heavy vehicle driver.  Usually, he has  been\r\n\r\nbooked for illegal parking.  He wants the MP to help him  get\r\n\r\nthe  fine  waived or reduced.  Often, he comes  with  several\r\n\r\nsummonses.   I believe many Members have similar experiences.\r\n\r\nAt first I was somewhat perplexed by this group.  Either they\r\n\r\nare  very bad statisticians who cannot calculate properly the\r\n\r\nprobability of being booked or there is a genuine problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a genuine problem. Heavy vehicle car\r\n\r\nparks  are  sited  kilometres away from  residential  blocks.\r\n\r\nThat  is sound town planning policy.  But unfortunately  that\r\n\r\nis  where the planning stops.  There is no follow-up from the\r\n\r\nland  transport  policy  side.  Should  we  not  require  bus\r\n\r\noperators,  for example, to operate early hour buses  to  get\r\n\r\nthese  people who work very, very early, about  four  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning, to their heavy vehicle car parks?  Initially I asked\r\n\r\nthem  why  they  did not take public transport.   The  common\r\n\r\nresponse  -  no  buses  that early.   Why  not  taxis  -  too\r\n\r\nexpensive.  Why not use the motorbike - no licence.  Why  not\r\n\r\nuse bicycles - always stolen.  Frustrated, I was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntempted  to ask: why not join brisk walking clubs.  But  that\r\n\r\nwould have added insult to injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a small matter in the context of a national\r\n\r\npolicy on land transport, even smaller in the context of  the\r\n\r\naspiration  to  achieve a world class transportation  system.\r\n\r\nBut  I  must  really ask:  is there no transport supremo,  no\r\n\r\noversight  inter-departmental committee  that  could  finally\r\n\r\nresolve  this small dot of the problem?  Is it too  difficult\r\n\r\nto get the bus companies, the LTA, URA, HDB, to talk together\r\n\r\nabout how to help this unfortunate group of persons?  Can  we\r\n\r\nnot, as the MOS mentioned just now, ask the PTC to have a USO\r\n\r\n(universal  service  obligation)  to  deal  with  this  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle  car park problem.  I would like to urge the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  give  some priority to this issue and these persons  with\r\n\r\nsome chance of avoiding future bookings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, speaking of another form of public\r\n\r\ntransport,  namely,  taxis, totally unrelated  to  the  first\r\n\r\nissue  I  raised,  I  should like to ask why  taxis  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  use bus lanes during the restricted  period,  as\r\n\r\ncommon  in  many other countries.  The reason I ask  this  is\r\n\r\nthat  very  often, I notice that the bus lanes are  not  well\r\n\r\nutilised even at peak hours while everyone else seems  to  be\r\n\r\ncluttering  in the other lanes, adding to the congestion.   I\r\n\r\nhope  that the Ministry will ensure that improvements be made\r\n\r\nto   bus  services  and  other  means  of  public  transport.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  a  good  reputation internationally  for  its\r\n\r\nclockwork-like efficiency in many sectors, and a good  public\r\n\r\ntransport  system  catering to the  needs  of  all  types  of\r\n\r\nresidents should be within achievable targets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  what  the  status is  of  the  action  on  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the  IMC on the Ageing  Population  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  meeting the transport needs of elderly commuters.\r\n\r\nIt  has  been  a  year and a half since the  IMC  Report  was\r\n\r\npublished in 1999.

A  parent  carrying a  child  on  one  arm  and\r\n\r\npossibly shopping or other bags in the other experiences  the\r\n\r\nsame difficulty in getting on a fast-moving escalator in  our\r\n\r\nMRT stations as a senior citizen who is perhaps not so steady\r\n\r\non her feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore ask if the North-east MRT line and the\r\n\r\nLRT  stations currently being built will indeed have barrier-free  access,  and whether in fact any existing MRT  stations\r\n\r\nhave yet to be retrofitted with ramps and lifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to buses, what progress has been made on the\r\n\r\nproposed  pilot project to test the efficiency of wheelchair-accessible buses?  Has anybody taken that up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year and a half, has LTA been more\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  encouraging taxi operators to bring  in  more\r\n\r\nwheelchair-friendly cabs and what are the proposals to reduce\r\n\r\ntaxes  for  this type of vehicle in return for reduced  fares\r\n\r\nfor the target users of this service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also two short-term measures recommended, ie,\r\n\r\nof  looking into the pool of existing transport resources and\r\n\r\nmodifying current transport arrangements to ensure that there\r\n\r\nare  affordable  and elderly-friendly transport  services  to\r\n\r\neldercare  facilities even now.  This was  to  be  undertaken\r\n\r\njointly  by MCDS, MOH, NCSS and the LTA.  What has  been  the\r\n\r\noutcome of this effort?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the IMC gave a longer time horizon over which the\r\n\r\nLTA  might  implement its recommendations, anticipating  that\r\n\r\nthe   numbers   of  elderly  would  really  start   to   grow\r\n\r\ntremendously  in the next decade or two down  the  road,  the\r\n\r\nchallenge in making the environment family-friendly  is  here\r\n\r\nwith  us  today.  I would therefore like to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhat   the   timeframes   are  for  implementation   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations and if these timeframes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan be speeded up for the benefit of both senior citizens  as\r\n\r\nwell as parents with young children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, I have two cuts.

I will take the\r\n\r\nfirst cut first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): During the Budget debate last year, I\r\n\r\nmentioned   that  the CTE was like a very  heavily  congested\r\n\r\nartery  and  there  was a need for us  to  perform  a  bypass\r\n\r\nsurgery  on it.  The residents in the north-eastern  part  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  very happy that the Minister has  decided  to\r\n\r\nspeed  up  the construction of Kallang/Paya Lebar Expressway.\r\n\r\nI  hope  LTA would give us more details and advise us on  the\r\n\r\ntime-frame of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the very congested artery, the CTE, I think the\r\n\r\nGovernment should consider putting in a \"stent\", that is,  to\r\n\r\nexpand the bottleneck part on the CTE or even convert some of\r\n\r\nthe  roads into two-tier highways. I hope that the Government\r\n\r\nwould  seriously look into this matter.  I am sure we do  not\r\n\r\nwish to see more toll-gates along the CTE.  I think we should\r\n\r\nconvert  them into two-tier highways so that the traffic  can\r\n\r\nbe more free-flowing.  Also, the bottleneck situations at the\r\n\r\nexits  are  very serious.  Whenever a vehicle  comes  to  the\r\n\r\nexit,  it  would  run into a traffic jam  and  the  motorists\r\n\r\ncannot  reach  their  destination on  time.   Then,  all  our\r\n\r\nefforts to make our highway free-flowing would be in vain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, Prof. Chin expressed the\r\n\r\nwoes of the heavy vehicle drivers.  In fact, as an MP, I have\r\n\r\nalso  received a lot of appeals and feedback  from  them.   I\r\n\r\nshall restrict myself to the public transport part and not to\r\n\r\ncomment  on the National Development part about the provision\r\n\r\nof parking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin feels that we should provide public transport\r\n\r\nto  these workers in odd hours of the day.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nrespond that there is a cost to doing so.  Because while  you\r\n\r\ncan  provide  a 24-hour service, but then the cost  would  be\r\n\r\nquite  tremendous.  For this reason, we also do  not  service\r\n\r\nshift workers, for instance.  Shift workers will have to find\r\n\r\ntheir  own transport or their employers will have to  provide\r\n\r\ntransport for them to get home.  So there is a limit to  what\r\n\r\nwe  can do.  For now, in terms of demand for transport, it is\r\n\r\nstill  not  a  huge demand.  Therefore, to  provide  a  cost-effective service to them would be very difficult.  You  can,\r\n\r\nbut then the cost would be very high.  For this reason, shift\r\n\r\nworkers get their transport services from their employers  or\r\n\r\nthey use their own motorbikes, or whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, these heavy vehicle drivers are like shift\r\n\r\nworkers.   They  are small in numbers.  Some  of  course  are\r\n\r\nworking  for  bigger  employers, and these  bigger  employers\r\n\r\nshould be able to try to provide transport for them.  For the\r\n\r\nsmaller ones or the self-employed, it is really difficult  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  bus service just to service a handful of  people.\r\n\r\nIf  they tell you that even if they use bicycles and they are\r\n\r\nstolen, I think they have gone a bit too far.  So they  would\r\n\r\nhave to try to find their own transport arrangement to get to\r\n\r\nwork in these odd hours of the night.  In terms of trying to,\r\n\r\nsay,  start the service early, as proposed by Prof.  Chin,  I\r\n\r\ncan  ask  PTC to take a look.  But, again, you would have  to\r\n\r\nweigh the cost versus the benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On taxis, Prof. Chin wants us to allow taxis to use the\r\n\r\nbus  lanes.  I am sure he knows what bus lanes are for.  When\r\n\r\nwe  determine  the  drawing of the  bus  lanes,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nstandard,  and this standard is that at least  50  buses  per\r\n\r\nhour  must  use this route in order to have a bus  lane.   In\r\n\r\nCBD,  at the moment, there are about 120 buses per hour using\r\n\r\nthese  bus lanes.  There are in Singapore about 18,000 taxis.\r\n\r\nIf  you allow taxis to drop off and pick up passengers  along\r\n\r\nthe  bus  lane, it is definitely going to affect the flow  of\r\n\r\noperation  of buses.  We know that public transport  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant  and public transport by buses is a very  efficient\r\n\r\nway\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  transporting people, and commuters value such smooth flow\r\n\r\nof  buses.   So the reliability of bus services is  therefore\r\n\r\nvery important to Singaporeans.  Therefore, we would not like\r\n\r\nto  risk  disrupting such good bus services.  But we do  note\r\n\r\nthat  there  are areas where perhaps the bus  lanes  are  not\r\n\r\nfully  utilised.  In fact, I asked the same question as Prof.\r\n\r\nChin when I drove along some of these roads and I saw the bus\r\n\r\nlane  without  many buses.  Hence, since last year,  we  have\r\n\r\nstarted  to allow bus lanes outside the CBD areas for private\r\n\r\nbuses  - school bus and private hire bus.  This is the  first\r\n\r\nstep,  so  as to utilise the bus lanes more fully.   We  will\r\n\r\nreview  after some time and see what is the impact  of  these\r\n\r\nadditional buses on the operation of scheduled public  buses.\r\n\r\nIf  we can, we will consider his suggestion of allowing other\r\n\r\ntypes of vehicles to use the bus lanes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Jennifer Lee wanted an update on the programme\r\n\r\nto  implement the IMC's recommendations.  It is our objective\r\n\r\nto  make  our public transport system accessible to all,  and\r\n\r\nthat  includes  the  elderly as well as  mothers  with  young\r\n\r\nchildren  in strollers.  Towards this objective, all on-going\r\n\r\nrapid  transit system projects and new LRT lines will  comply\r\n\r\nwith   the  code  of  barrier-free  accessibility.   So  this\r\n\r\nincludes the North East line, Expo Station that we have  just\r\n\r\nopened  and  the  LRT that we are going to operate.   So,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  the  Bukit Panjang LRT, which was opened  in  November\r\n\r\n1999, also has complied with this code.  For the existing  48\r\n\r\nMRT  stations, LTA is currently embarking on an  exercise  to\r\n\r\nretrofit  them with lifts, ramps, and disabled  toilets.   In\r\n\r\nfact, currently, there are four pilot stations that are being\r\n\r\nretrofitted  and  the  remaining 44  stations  will  also  be\r\n\r\nprogressively  upgraded in batches and  stages  between  next\r\n\r\nyear  and  late 2004.  So by end 2004, we should be  able  to\r\n\r\nretrofit all stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for commuter facilities, such as taxi stands and bus\r\n\r\nshelters,  pavements,  etc, accessible  facilities  would  be\r\n\r\nprogressively   provided   and  evolved   alongside   planned\r\n\r\ndevelopment or major upgrading\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworks.   She also asked about buses.  The IMC encouraged  bus\r\n\r\noperators to make the bus system more elderly-friendly in the\r\n\r\nlong  term  by introducing elderly-friendly buses,  as  older\r\n\r\nbuses  are  being  phased  out.  We cannot  do  it  overnight\r\n\r\nbecause  the  existing buses are still in use.  As  they  are\r\n\r\nbeing phased out, and when bus operators buy new buses,  they\r\n\r\nwill  make  sure that these buses are elderly-friendly.   SBS\r\n\r\nand  TIBS  have  to-date brought in a total of  192  elderly-friendly  low  floor buses with either single or  zero  step.\r\n\r\nAnd  this year, I am told that the operators intend to  bring\r\n\r\nin another 120 elderly-friendly buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked about buses for wheelchair. That is something\r\n\r\nwhich has to be looked into very carefully because it is  not\r\n\r\njust  the  capital  cost, it is also  the  operation  of  the\r\n\r\nwheelchair,  what they call kneeling buses, that  has  to  be\r\n\r\nlooked at because they may affect the efficient operation  of\r\n\r\nour  existing bus operation.  So these are things which  have\r\n\r\nto be further looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee also asked about taxis that can take in\r\n\r\nwheelchair  and whether we can facilitate those taxis.   Yes,\r\n\r\nwe  intend to make it easier for taxi companies to  buy  such\r\n\r\ntaxis  because  she is right that these taxis at  the  moment\r\n\r\ncost more compared to the normal taxis.  So I think we should\r\n\r\nincentivise  them to bring in such taxis which  can  take  in\r\n\r\nwheelchair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third recommendation of IMC was to examine how\r\n\r\nexisting  transport resources can be pooled and  arrangements\r\n\r\nmodified  to  provide  affordable elderly-friendly  transport\r\n\r\nservices  to elder care services and facilities.   Individual\r\n\r\nVWOs currently provide transport services to their clients by\r\n\r\nmeans  of  contract buses or retrofitted vehicles capable  of\r\n\r\ntransporting  the  wheelchair  bound.   MCDS  and  NCSS   are\r\n\r\ncurrently  studying the need to pool together and  centralise\r\n\r\nthe resources of the various VWOs for more optimal management\r\n\r\nand utilisation.  In fact, the Ministry thinks that this is a\r\n\r\ngood  way of providing transport services to the elderly  and\r\n\r\nto the handicapped.  Because at the moment, each one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovides its own and that can be inefficient.  But if we  can\r\n\r\ncentralise them, the resources can be better utilised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about the progress of KPE\r\n\r\nand  what  we are doing to alleviate the congestion  in  CTE.\r\n\r\nThe  LTA  will  be constructing the Kallang  and  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nExpressway  (KPE) to provide an alternative route for  people\r\n\r\nin  the  North  East  sector.   The  tenders  for  all  major\r\n\r\ncontracts for the KPE will be called by the end of this year,\r\n\r\nand  the  whole expressway will open in 2006.  The KPE,  when\r\n\r\ncompleted, will help relieve congestion on the CTE.   In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  the  LTA  is expanding the CTE and  Braddell  Road\r\n\r\ninterchange.  This involves the construction of an  underpass\r\n\r\nalong Braddell Road, and the realignment and widening of  the\r\n\r\nfour  slip roads leading to and from the CTE.  When completed\r\n\r\nin  December 2002, this project will facilitate the  flow  of\r\n\r\nthe  traffic  leaving the CTE and thus, help to  improve  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  flow along the CTE.   The opening of the  North-East\r\n\r\nline  in  2002 next year will give people in the  North  East\r\n\r\nsector another transport alternative, and remove some traffic\r\n\r\ndemand from the CTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether we can have a double deck expressway\r\n\r\nalong  CTE.   To have this kind of double deck expressway  is\r\n\r\nvery  costly.   At  the same time, when  you  introduce  more\r\n\r\ntraffic on to the roads, you will also have problem when  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  converges to make sure that there is no  congestion.\r\n\r\nI  think  we  have to be very careful when we  consider  such\r\n\r\ndouble deck highway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered all the questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In recent years, the\r\n\r\nnumber of fatal accidents happening along the expressways  is\r\n\r\nvery  alarming.   Putting aside the  human  factor,  such  as\r\n\r\ndrunken driving, we want to ask whether or not the design  of\r\n\r\nour highways has reached international safety standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has LTA conducted any comprehensive inspection on our\r\n\r\nhighways to ensure that the safety of our road users would be\r\n\r\nprotected?   We  would also like to remove all the  objective\r\n\r\nand  environmental factors that would threaten the safety  of\r\n\r\nthe  road  users.   Many  residents  and  NTUC  members  have\r\n\r\nreflected  to  me  that the safety measures provided  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are doing road repairing or tree pruning  works\r\n\r\nalong  the  highways  are not adequate.   I  hope  LTA  would\r\n\r\nenhance the safety measures so that the workers who are doing\r\n\r\nthe  road  repair or tree pruning works would  be  adequately\r\n\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the positioning of the traffic signboards\r\n\r\nshould also be looked into.  These signs should give a  clear\r\n\r\nindication  as  to  when  there is an  exit  ahead.   If  the\r\n\r\nsignboard  is  positioned too near to the exit,  the  drivers\r\n\r\nwill  not be given sufficient notice to enable them to change\r\n\r\nlanes  safely.   Noticing  the signboards   just  before  the\r\n\r\nexits,  some rash drivers would just swerve their  cars  into\r\n\r\nthe lane of the other cars without due care and diligence for\r\n\r\nthe  safety of the other users of the road, resulting in some\r\n\r\nserious accidents.  Moreover, very often these road signs are\r\n\r\nblocked  by  the  trees.   I think  this  is  a  very  common\r\n\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many residents are also quite unhappy with the frequency\r\n\r\nof  the  diggings along the highway and they are  questioning\r\n\r\nwhether  LTA has been coordinating with the other Ministries.\r\n\r\nMany  residents  in the private estates felt that  roads  are\r\n\r\nbeing  dug up much too frequently by the various departments,\r\n\r\nsuch as the Telecoms, PUB,  Ministry of the Environment, etc,\r\n\r\nwith  one  department digging it, patch up, and then  another\r\n\r\ndepartment  would come and dig it up again.    This  lack  of\r\n\r\ncoordination among the various departments causes  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the residents and danger to the road users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan:</b> Sir, I would like the Minister\r\n\r\nto  review  how taxi fares can be made better as well  as  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  waiting time for taxis.  First, the taxi  fares.\r\n\r\nThere are currently many types of supplementary taxi charges.\r\n\r\nThese are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharges  for  dialing  in to make reservations,  charges  for\r\n\r\nwaiting time, charges for entering the CBD, charges for going\r\n\r\nto the airport, charges for hailing the cab at certain hours,\r\n\r\nand  so on.  These can be quite confusing for taxi passengers\r\n\r\nwhen  the  supplementary charges are kicked  in.   While  the\r\n\r\nmeter  indicates one reading, the passenger may be  asked  to\r\n\r\npay  another  amount.  This amount may be  correct  when  the\r\n\r\nvarious  supplementary charges are taken into  consideration.\r\n\r\nBut short of reasoning it out with the taxi driver, it is not\r\n\r\neasy  on your own trying to account for the higher taxi fares\r\n\r\nthan what is indicated in the taxi meter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if our taxis are using the GPS system, I do not see\r\n\r\nwhy they cannot harness technology to provide clearer reading\r\n\r\nof  taxi  fares.   Our  taxis should be equipped  to  provide\r\n\r\nprintouts  so  that  if the taxi fare is different  from  the\r\n\r\nmeter  reading,  the printout will give a  breakdown  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  supplementary  charges.   This  will  avoid   giving\r\n\r\ntourists  and visitors, who are unfamiliar with  the  various\r\n\r\nsupplementary  taxi  charges, the wrong impression  that  our\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers may be over-charging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the waiting time for taxis. It is extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult to hail a taxi during certain hours and at  certain\r\n\r\nlocations, for example, just before midnight, during the peak\r\n\r\nperiod,  in the CBD, Orchard Road area, Turf Club, etc.   Can\r\n\r\nthe  Minister enlighten us on whether his Ministry  considers\r\n\r\nthe  waiting  time for taxis in deciding the number  of  taxi\r\n\r\nlicences?   What  is the average waiting time  for  taxis  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and how do they fare as compared to other cities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the supply of taxis is a fine\r\n\r\nbalancing act and that an increase in the number of taxis  to\r\n\r\ncater for the peak hours may result in excess capacity during\r\n\r\nthe  off-peak  hours  and therefore  lower  income  for  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers.   This,  however,  may  be  partially  addressed  by\r\n\r\nraising  taxi fares so that fringe commuters would decide  to\r\n\r\nuse  other means of public transport, or use the taxis merely\r\n\r\nfor  connection to MRT stations or bus routes.  I would  like\r\n\r\nthe Minister to elaborate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether   there  are  plans  on  hand  to  deal   with   this\r\n\r\npredicament,  and whether the solution is to  introduce  more\r\n\r\ntaxi operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> I wish to raise the\r\n\r\nconcern of drivers who are employed to drive their companies'\r\n\r\nvehicles.  Under the Road Traffic Act, the liability of  such\r\n\r\nemployed  drivers for certain offences is no  different  from\r\n\r\ndrivers who are also owners of the vehicles.  I believe  that\r\n\r\nthey should be treated differently as their circumstances are\r\n\r\nvery  different.   Owners must be held  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of their vehicles.  On the other hand, being mere\r\n\r\nemployees,  employed drivers have little or no  control  over\r\n\r\nthe  maintenance  of  the vehicles they have  been  asked  to\r\n\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight two of such offences. First,\r\n\r\nunder section 15 of the Road Traffic Act, any person who uses\r\n\r\non  any  road any vehicle for which a licence is not enforced\r\n\r\nis guilty of an offence.  I have come across a case where the\r\n\r\ndriver noticed that the vehicle's road tax had not been  paid\r\n\r\nfor  a  few months.  On asking his employer, he was  verbally\r\n\r\nassured that the arrears had been settled when, in fact, that\r\n\r\nwas not the case and the vehicle had been deregistered due to\r\n\r\nnon-payment  of road tax.  The driver was in no  position  to\r\n\r\nask  his employer for documentary evidence that the road  tax\r\n\r\nhad indeed been paid and the licence was still in force.   He\r\n\r\ncould  only take his employer's word for it.  However,  after\r\n\r\nhe was stopped by the police, he was prosecuted for driving a\r\n\r\nderegistered vehicle and asked to attend court to  answer  to\r\n\r\nthe charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, under section 72 of the same Act, the driver\r\n\r\nof  the vehicle which emits smoke or visible vapour is guilty\r\n\r\nof  an offence.  Sir, in the present job market, the employed\r\n\r\ndrivers are fearful of losing their jobs and their rice bowl.\r\n\r\nIf   they  were  to  raise  concerns  of  roadworthiness   or\r\n\r\nregistration of the vehicle with their employers, the chances\r\n\r\nof  being  fired  are  rather high.   They  are  legitimately\r\n\r\nconcerned that they may lose their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njobs and are, therefore, forced to take unwarranted risks  of\r\n\r\nfacing  the  dire  consequences  themselves.   For  them,  it\r\n\r\nbecomes a question of choosing between the devil and the deep\r\n\r\nblue sea.  If they refuse to drive the vehicle, they will  be\r\n\r\nfired  and  others, who are more desperate,  may  take  their\r\n\r\nplace.  If, on the other hand, they drive the vehicle on  the\r\n\r\nroads,  they  may have to face the risk of being  caught  and\r\n\r\nprosecuted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to review the law, such\r\n\r\nthat  employers  share a greater burden  of  maintaining  the\r\n\r\nvehicles.   In this way, we are still maintaining  safety  on\r\n\r\nour  roads  and yet placing the responsibility on  the  right\r\n\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, before I speak\r\n\r\non the cut, I would like to declare my interest as a Director\r\n\r\nof  Singapore Technologies Kinetics, which is involved in the\r\n\r\nbusiness of developing electric and hybrid vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the Government's stand on the role of\r\n\r\nelectric  or  hybrid  vehicles should be  strategic  and  not\r\n\r\nconfined  to vehicle ownership considerations.  The rationale\r\n\r\nfor  using  the  environmentally-friendly  electric  vehicles\r\n\r\n(EVs) is relatively clear-cut.  Besides, our small size makes\r\n\r\nfor  a  conducive  environment to use EVs to maximum  effect.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it is also well-known that, despite the  20%  lower\r\n\r\nOMV  incentive,  the cost of EVs can still end  up  some  50%\r\n\r\nhigher   than  those  of  comparable  conventional  vehicles.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  other  things being equal,  there  is  really  no\r\n\r\nincentive for consumers to switch to EVs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several other countries have put in place a framework\r\n\r\nfor  the  gradual  conversion of use to  electric  or  hybrid\r\n\r\nvehicles.  In the US, for example, 10% of all new vehicles in\r\n\r\nCalifornia  must use alternative fuel, of which  4%  must  be\r\n\r\nzero emission.  Hong Kong is granting a one-time registration\r\n\r\nexemption  for  zero-emission  vehicles  and  is  working  on\r\n\r\nincentives for hybrid vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to ask the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nmore substantive incentives to promote the use of electric or\r\n\r\nhybrid  vehicles, and not to limit these to  passenger  cars.\r\n\r\nIntroduction  of  a certain mix to public vehicles,  such  as\r\n\r\nbuses  and  taxis, should also be contemplated  as  well,  as\r\n\r\nthese tend to spend more time on the road.  Any reduction  in\r\n\r\npollution will therefore be material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, to support such a strategic move, the\r\n\r\nGovernment must also ensure that the infrastructure  for  use\r\n\r\nof  EVs exists.  HDB, JTC and URA should, therefore, consider\r\n\r\nsetting  up  charging  stations  in  car  parks  under  their\r\n\r\ncontrol.   Otherwise, the inconvenience will negate  whatever\r\n\r\nincentives  the Government has put in place, and there  would\r\n\r\nbe few takers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has raised the issue\r\n\r\nof safety on our roads.  I would like to reassure Mr Yeo that\r\n\r\nLTA  looks very closely at our design, and we are putting  in\r\n\r\nplace a lot of measures to ensure that our roads continue  to\r\n\r\nmatch international standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has raised the issue of construction on road sites.\r\n\r\nLet  me  address some of the specific issues he  has  raised.\r\n\r\nLet me first inform the House that LTA has a Code of Practice\r\n\r\nfor  Temporary  Traffic Control for works in  progress  along\r\n\r\nroads.   Contractors and their workmen should follow this  to\r\n\r\nensure   that  the  appropriate  sign  posting  to   forewarn\r\n\r\nmotorists  of any works ahead, and on the safety measures  to\r\n\r\nbe  observed.   If  the contractors fail to comply  with  the\r\n\r\nCode,  they  will  be fined and issued with  demerit  points.\r\n\r\nThey  can  also be suspended from carrying out any other  new\r\n\r\nworks  along  the  roads.  In addition, contractors  who  are\r\n\r\nworking along the expressways are required to notify the EMAS\r\n\r\ncontrol  room  of their roadworks so that we  can  flash  the\r\n\r\nappropriate warning messages on the electronic panels located\r\n\r\nalong the expressways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure that we have taken is that contractors\r\n\r\nare  allowed  to work along expressways only during  off-peak\r\n\r\nhours  and, if they wish to work along the expressways,  they\r\n\r\nmust   submit  an  application  to  LTA.   LTA  will   advise\r\n\r\ncontractors  to stop work and leave the site immediately,  if\r\n\r\nany  congestion  is  observed.  So  these  are  some  of  the\r\n\r\nmeasures that we have put in place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, if there are complaints with regard to\r\n\r\ncongestion and ill-placed signages, motorists can refer their\r\n\r\ncomplaints  to LTA, which will investigate and take  remedial\r\n\r\nmeasures swiftly.  My Minister has instructed LTA to step  up\r\n\r\nenforcement, especially at construction locations, to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our  rules are strictly followed in view of the  safety\r\n\r\nconcerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the blockage of the signages by plants and\r\n\r\nsignboards,  LTA  works  very closely  with  NParks,  and  we\r\n\r\nconduct  regular  patrols on our roads to look  out  for  any\r\n\r\nblockage.   Once  such a blockage is found,  LTA  will  alert\r\n\r\nNParks  immediately,  if  there  is  a  need  to  remove  the\r\n\r\nblockage.   LTA  is also careful that new signboards  do  not\r\n\r\nblock  motorists' view at road junctions.  It has,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nrecently  conducted  an exercise to review  the  position  of\r\n\r\nexisting signboards.  Some of the signboards have since  been\r\n\r\ncombined  to reduce the number of signboards and ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe motorists' view is not blocked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Yeo raised the issue of road digging. Road\r\n\r\ndigging  activities, Sir, are coordinated  through  the  Road\r\n\r\nOpening  Coordination Committee, which the  LTA  chairs,  and\r\n\r\ncomprises representatives from organisations that need to dig\r\n\r\nup   the   roads  to  lay  their  facilities.   They  include\r\n\r\nPowerGrid,  PowerGas,  PUB, SCV,  SingTel  and  many  others.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Committee will coordinate their  works  and,\r\n\r\nwhere  possible,  tie  in with LTA's  road  construction  and\r\n\r\nmaintenance programme, to minimise disruption to traffic flow\r\n\r\nand ensure safety of road users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a requirement that newly completed roads\r\n\r\ncan  only be opened up for laying of services two years after\r\n\r\nthe   completion  of  the  road  construction.    For   newly\r\n\r\nresurfaced  roads, the ban on road opening is for  one  year.\r\n\r\nHowever,  an exception to the above ban is made if the  works\r\n\r\nare  of  an  emergency nature, such as  the  repairing  of  a\r\n\r\ndamaged pipe or a sewer pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, LTA and the members of the Committee\r\n\r\nhave  also  come  up  with many improvements,  including  new\r\n\r\nmethods  of laying pipes and cables without the need  to  dig\r\n\r\nthe  roads.  Notwithstanding this precaution, Sir, there  are\r\n\r\nabout  8,000 road digging works annually as a result  of  the\r\n\r\nmany development works and high demand for utility services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong has raised a few things about our taxi\r\n\r\nindustry.   Let  me  first  reply on the  question  regarding\r\n\r\nfares.   Since  1997, taxi operators have been  progressively\r\n\r\nreplacing  taxi  meters  with more sophisticated  types  that\r\n\r\ndisplay the various fare components, eg, booking fees,  meter\r\n\r\nfare  and  the various surcharges.  Today, about 92%  of  the\r\n\r\n19,000  taxis  on the roads have been fitted with  these  new\r\n\r\ntaxi  meters.   Taxi commuters are able to  get  an  itemised\r\n\r\nreceipt  from  these taxi meters, on request.  The  remaining\r\n\r\n1,500   taxis   will   be   equipped  with   similar   meters\r\n\r\nprogressively over the next 2 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the availability of taxis, Mr Noris Ong raised\r\n\r\nthe issue on whether or not we are looking into how to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  taxis  are available, especially in areas such  as  the\r\n\r\nCBD,  or  after past midnight.  On the issue of taxi shortage\r\n\r\nbefore  midnight,  taxi  operators have  the  flexibility  to\r\n\r\nadjust their surcharges to match demand with supply, as fares\r\n\r\nhave  been deregulated since 1998.  TIBS' taxis, for example,\r\n\r\nhave  modified  their  surcharge to start  at  11.30  pm,  to\r\n\r\nencourage  more  of their drivers to be on the  roads  before\r\n\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding some of these measures, Sir, we are\r\n\r\nlooking into putting in place a quality standard for the taxi\r\n\r\nindustry.   At  the  moment,  for example,  we  receive  many\r\n\r\ncomplaints,  and  we  deal directly with the  taxi  operators\r\n\r\nregarding  the  abuse of signages and people not  wanting  to\r\n\r\npick  up fares.  So there is an on-going review for the  taxi\r\n\r\nindustry.   Mr Ong has asked whether we could solve  some  of\r\n\r\nthese teething problems with a third operator.  We will leave\r\n\r\nthis to the review, as we deregulate the industry further, as\r\n\r\nto whether or not there is a need for more than two operators\r\n\r\ncurrently, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong has raised the issue of the liability of employee-drivers for vehicle offences. Sir, the law does place the\r\n\r\nprimary  responsibility on the owner of a vehicle  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  vehicle  complies  with  all  the  relevant  laws.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not absolve the driver, who also  has  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to make the necessary checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, a driver must ensure that his vehicle\r\n\r\ncomplies   with   all  usage  requirements,   which   include\r\n\r\nregistration  and licensing requirements.  Other requirements\r\n\r\ninclude,  for  example, complying with the vehicle's  maximum\r\n\r\nladen  weight,  ensuring  the vehicle  does  not  emit  smoky\r\n\r\nexhaust  and  is properly lit, as these would impact  on  the\r\n\r\nsafety or comfort of other road users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are parallel responsibilities placed by the law on\r\n\r\nthe  owner  and  the driver.  However, Sir, if  an  employee-driver  is able to offer mitigating factors for his  offence,\r\n\r\nthe authority will review his case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the question of electric vehicles\r\n\r\nraised  by  Mrs  Lim,  I  would like to  thank  her  for  her\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  But, as she is aware, the Green Vehicle  Rebates\r\n\r\nfor   hybrid  and  electric  cars  were  implemented  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of this year, basically, to allow people  who  want\r\n\r\nto  buy such vehicles.  The rebates are intended to lower the\r\n\r\nupfront  and annualised cost differential between  green  and\r\n\r\nconventional cars.  With these rebates and their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlower fuel costs, the annualised operating cost of green cars\r\n\r\nwill be comparable to that of conventional cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not our intention to make green cars cheaper than\r\n\r\nconventional  cars  as  the  primary  strategy   of   vehicle\r\n\r\nownership  still  holds.  But within this framework,  we  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  introduce  rebates to  try  to  lower  the  tax\r\n\r\ncomponent, so that the cost differential between conventional\r\n\r\nand electric/hybrid vehicles is not too great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of extending the rebates to buses and\r\n\r\ntaxis, LTA, in consultation with the Ministry of Finance,  is\r\n\r\nprepared to consider this, if there are viable vehicle models\r\n\r\nfor importing into our local transport market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government will not intervene in the purchase\r\n\r\ndecision   of   transport  operators  by   stipulating   what\r\n\r\npercentage  of  their  fleet should  be  electric  or  hybrid\r\n\r\nvehicles,  as such decisions are best left to the  operators.\r\n\r\nIf  there  are attractive models available in the  market  at\r\n\r\nprices  that  are acceptable to buyers, the  demand  will  be\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of infrastructure, Sir, the Environment\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  the lead agency and, as I understand  it,  they\r\n\r\nwill  coordinate with other public sector agencies to provide\r\n\r\nan   infrastructure,  as  and  when  the  technology  becomes\r\n\r\ncommercially viable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Will the Minister update the House\r\n\r\non the performance of Changi Airport?

How  does Changi  Airport  stand,  in\r\n\r\ncompetition with the regional airports in Hong Kong,  Bangkok\r\n\r\nand  Kuala  Lumpur?

On port\r\n\r\ncompetition, I wish the Minister can update the House on  the\r\n\r\nstate  of  competition faced by PSA around this  region.   We\r\n\r\nhave  read of the recent developments of Tanjung Pelapas  and\r\n\r\nWestport  in  Malaysia.  It must be fair to say that  Tanjung\r\n\r\nPelapas  has  made quite some progress since they  had  their\r\n\r\nfirst  major  customer drawn away from the  PSA.   Would  the\r\n\r\nMinister inform the House what is the percentage size of this\r\n\r\nrevenue  loss  from  the  Maersk pull-out?   What  about  the\r\n\r\nsignificant  downstream  cost and  impact  of  this  loss  of\r\n\r\nbusiness?  Could PSA have averted the loss of the world's No.\r\n\r\n1  shipping  line  as  customer, if it had  accommodated  the\r\n\r\ncustomer's  need?   For example, we hear of privatised  berth\r\n\r\noperation as a reason, correct me if I am wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many shipping MNCs have a need for integrated supply\r\n\r\nchain logistics operations, and these require some degree  of\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  costs  and  schedules  for  their  supply  chain\r\n\r\nrationalisation.  Such a need may indeed be a justifiable one\r\n\r\nfor shipping lines.  Are we answering to this need?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA did $2.4 billion of turnover in the year 2000, with\r\n\r\n$1.4  billion of pre-tax profits.  That is a lot of room  for\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, all along,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have taken pride in our port.   For  two  years\r\n\r\nrunning,  PSA  has won the honour of being  ranked  the  best\r\n\r\nseaport  because of the hard work put in by  the  PSA  staff.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the port has won acclaim from all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is said, \"It is not easy to be No. 1, but\r\n\r\nmaintaining the leading position is even harder.\"  Today,  we\r\n\r\nare  facing tremendous competition.  This is particularly  so\r\n\r\nwhen 80% of our business comes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  transhipment services.  There is no  monopoly  in  this\r\n\r\nbusiness, and no shippers are duty-bound to stay loyal to any\r\n\r\nparticular  port.   Shipping  companies  can  transfer  their\r\n\r\nbusiness to any port, depending on the price, service levels,\r\n\r\nconvenience and preference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Maersk SeaLand sang \"Goodbye, My Love\" to PSA last\r\n\r\nyear,   is   only  one  example.   Though  the   company   is\r\n\r\ncontemplating  coming back to us, this does  not  change  the\r\n\r\nfact  that we continue to face very keen competition  in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness.   One  real-life example is if 3 million  TEUs  are\r\n\r\nhandled  by Malaysian ports, there will be a drop of  16%  in\r\n\r\nthe  volume of cargoes handled by our port.  Even if shipping\r\n\r\ncompanies do not intend to go to other ports, they  will  ask\r\n\r\nfor  more discounts and better rates by applying the pressure\r\n\r\nof  competition.   West  Port has declared  that  within  the\r\n\r\nregion, their port was next to none, and Tanjung Pelapas said\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  the best alternative port and it  intended  to\r\n\r\nsurpass  PSA to become the darling of the maritime  industry.\r\n\r\nCountries such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka are also trying  to\r\n\r\nbecome the transhipment hub of the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have confidence in PSA, but I hope that\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  take  heed of the  tremendous  competition\r\n\r\nfaced by our port.  We have to pay special attention to  this\r\n\r\nas  it concerns the job security of the staff and workers who\r\n\r\nwork  in  the shipping, stevedoring and logistics industries.\r\n\r\nI hope the Government will formulate policies and measures to\r\n\r\nhelp  us  maintain our superiority in our sea port.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask: should the Government build a Jurong Port  when\r\n\r\nPSA is already facing strong competition from other ports  in\r\n\r\nthe region?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Chay asked for an update on the\r\n\r\nperformance of Changi Airport and how does it rate versus the\r\n\r\nother  airports, and whether the membership  of  the  airline\r\n\r\nalliances has helped Changi Airport and the impact of the new\r\n\r\nlong-distance planes that are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappearing over the horizon.

These\r\n\r\nwere  the  highest numbers in terms of passengers  and  cargo\r\n\r\nmovement  ever  handled  by Changi Airport  in  a  year.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  Changi  Airport won 16 best  airport  awards  from\r\n\r\ninternational travel and industry surveys in 2000,  and  this\r\n\r\nincludes the UK Business Traveller Best Airport award  for  a\r\n\r\nrecord 13th time.  Changi Airport continues to do well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of competition, Changi Airport is facing tough\r\n\r\ncompetition  because several new airports have opened  up  in\r\n\r\nthe  region.  At the same time, we are continuing to see  new\r\n\r\nairports being proposed. This means that Changi Airport would\r\n\r\nhave  no choice but to continue innovating and upgrading  its\r\n\r\nwide range of services in order to remain competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of ratings, Changi Airport continues to rate\r\n\r\nvery  well against new airports in the region.  The fact that\r\n\r\nwe  have several alliances flying through Singapore has  also\r\n\r\nhelped  Changi  Airport to register very strong  growth.   We\r\n\r\nhope  to  continue  anchoring  those  airline  alliances   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of Changi Airport's strengths is its ability to\r\n\r\nexpand facilities ahead of demand and this allows the Airport\r\n\r\nto  provide a high level of service to both the airlines  and\r\n\r\ntheir  passengers.   In  line with  their  strategy,  we  are\r\n\r\nexpanding  Changi Airport by adding the third  terminal.   Mr\r\n\r\nChay has also asked for some updates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, construction work on Terminal 3 has started in\r\n\r\nOctober  last year.  Tenders for the superstructure would  be\r\n\r\ninvited  in  the  third quarter of this year  and  we  expect\r\n\r\nTerminal  3  to  be ready in the year 2006.  When  completed,\r\n\r\nTerminal 3 will have a handling capacity of 20 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassengers.  This will bring Changi Airport's total  handling\r\n\r\ncapacity  to 64 million passengers.   This will allow  us  to\r\n\r\nmeet very comfortably the needs of the aviation industry  for\r\n\r\nmany years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the long-distance planes and the impact on\r\n\r\nChangi  Airport,  the  key  is  connectivity  through  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport.   If  we have the connectivity, then it  makes  good\r\n\r\nreason  for the planes to land in Singapore in order  to  use\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  re-distribute their passengers throughout  the\r\n\r\nregion.  And I think the passenger load in the entire  region\r\n\r\nis  still  very significant.  Even though we have  the  long-distance  planes,  I  would still see  Singapore  and  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport remaining as a key aviation hub in the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked about PSA. He asked about the state of\r\n\r\ncompetition  versus  PSA and the impact of  the  pull-out  by\r\n\r\nMaersk  on PSA.  Sir, the competition for transhipment  cargo\r\n\r\nhas  always  been there, even before the building of  Tanjung\r\n\r\nPelapas.   This  is because the transhipment cargo  does  not\r\n\r\nreally need to land in Singapore. They can be transhipped  in\r\n\r\nmany  ports  along the entire supply chain.   It  can  be  in\r\n\r\nKaoshiung, and also as far away as Malta and Sri  Lanka.   It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  have  to  be transhipped just at our  neighbouring\r\n\r\nports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA has been meeting the competition very successfully\r\n\r\nall  these  years and they have done it through a combination\r\n\r\nof   well-developed  facilities  and  the  use  of   advanced\r\n\r\ntechnology.  This allows both PSA and the shipping  companies\r\n\r\nusing  PSA to utilise technology to optimise their operations\r\n\r\nand to improve their productivity.  PSA's competitive edge is\r\n\r\nnot  just  pricing.  PSA's pricing is not  the  lowest.   You\r\n\r\nwould  have read in the papers that many of the ports in  the\r\n\r\nregion do offer rates that are perhaps down to half the price\r\n\r\nof  PSA.  It is not pricing alone.   It is, at the end of the\r\n\r\nday, the total value-added that PSA can bring to the business\r\n\r\ntable and that includes the technology part and systems  part\r\n\r\nthat  help  the  shipping companies  derive  value  from  the\r\n\r\nservices that PSA is giving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of Maersk's pull-out, Maersk made up about 10%\r\n\r\nof  PSA's throughput.  No doubt, the pull-out by Maersk would\r\n\r\nimpact  PSA  somewhat.  Over time, the growth  of  businesses\r\n\r\nfrom  the  other customers will help to offset  the  loss  of\r\n\r\nbusiness from Maersk, but PSA is not sitting still.   Members\r\n\r\nwould  have read in the papers last week that PSA and  Maersk\r\n\r\nhad  entered into a new agreement which would still see  some\r\n\r\nof the major ships from Maersk calling in Singapore.  I think\r\n\r\nthis  will  help bring back part of the Maersk's business  to\r\n\r\nPSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On dedicated terminals, whether this is a factor in\r\n\r\ncompanies  thinking about leaving Singapore and is this  part\r\n\r\nof  the  supply  chain  factor, I would  say  that  dedicated\r\n\r\nterminals  are useful in cases where the port  is  a  gateway\r\n\r\nport,  ie, there is no need for connectivity.  The ship  just\r\n\r\ncomes  in,  unloads,  the containers  and  cargoes  are  then\r\n\r\ndistributed by land to the hinterland.  In the case  of  PSA,\r\n\r\nthe   bulk   of  the  business  involves  transhipment.    So\r\n\r\nconnectivity   between  lines,  connectivity  with   regional\r\n\r\nshipping  companies to tranship to the regional markets,  all\r\n\r\nthese are very important.  In the case of Singapore, we  have\r\n\r\nthe added element that we are really very short of space.  We\r\n\r\nneed  to  optimise  the available space that  we  have  here.\r\n\r\nTherefore, PSA's common user terminal operation allows us  to\r\n\r\noptimise  the use of the limited land that we have, and  yet,\r\n\r\nat the same time, achieve a very high productivity and a very\r\n\r\nhigh  throughput.   This  gives us  tremendous  economies  of\r\n\r\nscale, as well as the shipping connectivity, which is why the\r\n\r\ncommon  user  terminal  approach has been  a  very  effective\r\n\r\ncompetitive tool utilised by PSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also commented on PSA's profit. I think his\r\n\r\nimplication is that it is very high and that this would  lead\r\n\r\nto  even greater competition.  Let me put this in perspective\r\n\r\nbecause  I think it is very important.  PSA handled a  record\r\n\r\nof  17 million TEUs last year and even then, the revenue fell\r\n\r\nby  3.3%.   As  a group, PSA's after-tax profit increased  by\r\n\r\n11.7% to $838 million.  I think Mr Chay mentioned the before-tax figure.  This increase in profit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  be  attributed, amongst others, to improved productivity\r\n\r\nfrom PSA's port operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The container port is a highly capital intensive one and\r\n\r\nPSA  therefore  needs to invest in costly infrastructure  and\r\n\r\nhighly  sophisticated equipment in order to achieve the  high\r\n\r\nservice  levels  and the productivity expected  by  its  many\r\n\r\ncustomers.  PSA's fixed assets currently amount to some  $6.8\r\n\r\nbillion   and   this   investment  is   going   to   increase\r\n\r\nsubstantially  in  the years to come.  I  will  give  you  an\r\n\r\nexample.  PSA now has about 36 berths.  The new Pasir Panjang\r\n\r\nTerminal, Phases I and II, will have only 26 berths  and  yet\r\n\r\nthe projected cost for these 26 berths will come to about  $7\r\n\r\nbillion.   The investment requirements are going to  be  even\r\n\r\ngreater  in  the years to come.  And yet, for all  the  risks\r\n\r\nthat  it has to undertake to put in all the huge investments,\r\n\r\nPSA's return on assets last year was only 12.3% which I think\r\n\r\nmost analysts would agree it is not unreasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about Jurong Port. He also\r\n\r\ntalked  about the competition from Tanjung Pelapas and  other\r\n\r\nports  and  what would the Government do to help  ensure  PSA\r\n\r\nsurvives  so  that the jobs we have would not be  lost.   The\r\n\r\nonly way for PSA to continue doing well is for it to keep  on\r\n\r\nenhancing  productivity through the greater use of technology\r\n\r\nand through better training of the workers.  I think that  is\r\n\r\nwhat PSA has been doing all these years.  I am sure that  PSA\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to do so because they have very  good  people\r\n\r\nthere,  who  are very skilled.  They have a lot of  expertise\r\n\r\nand  they have been able to compete very effectively  against\r\n\r\nregional and international competition.  What we will  do  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  will continue to encourage PSA to explore  all  the\r\n\r\npossible technologies that can be applied to the operation of\r\n\r\nthe  port  and  make sure that they continue  training  their\r\n\r\nworkers so that they remain competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Jurong Port, it has always been there.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not a recent development.  In fact, Jurong  Port  has\r\n\r\nbeen  operating since 1965 and it competes with PSA for  both\r\n\r\nthe conventional bulk cargo as well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas for a small number of container traffic.  What Jurong Port\r\n\r\nhas done recently is to purchase two container quay cranes in\r\n\r\norder  to  improve their productivity in handling  the  ships\r\n\r\nthat  bring in containers to Jurong Port.  At the end of  the\r\n\r\nday,  the capacity will still be very small because  the  two\r\n\r\nquay cranes would only give Jurong Port a capacity of 200,000\r\n\r\nTEUs  a  year  versus PSA's over 17 million TEUs  capacity  a\r\n\r\nyear.    Jurong  Port,  in  effect,  will  only  be  a  small\r\n\r\ncomplement  to  PSA and it will not be a true competitor  for\r\n\r\nthe container business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  his  comprehensive answers and  beg  leave  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Yeo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, the issue has been raised\r\n\r\nyesterday by other Members and answered by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yeo is not moving.

Although this  was\r\n\r\nnot  fully accepted, I am very grateful to MCIT and  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies for advancing the hours on Saturdays, from 2 pm  to\r\n\r\n10  am.   This revision was implemented smoothly without  any\r\n\r\nhiccups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the use of concession cards for senior\r\n\r\ncitizens is restricted to the off peak hours.  They can  only\r\n\r\nenjoy the concession after the peak period, from 10 am  to  4\r\n\r\npm,  and  after 7 pm from Mondays to Fridays.  On  Saturdays,\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  enjoy the concession after 10 am.  On Sundays and public\r\n\r\nholidays,  they enjoy whole day concession.   Right  now,  we\r\n\r\nhave  about  370,000 senior citizens who  had,  during  their\r\n\r\nyounger  days, contributed to the prosperity and progress  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Their welfare should be looked after  with  more\r\n\r\nobjective measures, and transport concession is only one  way\r\n\r\nto   express   our  appreciation  to  them  for  their   past\r\n\r\ncontribution.  I feel that we should relax the time limit for\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens  so that they can enjoy concession  for  the\r\n\r\nwhole day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many reasons for my plea. First, the\r\n\r\nrelaxation  of concession will facilitate senior citizens  to\r\n\r\ngo  out  and  take part in social and grassroots  activities,\r\n\r\nand  to  visit their friends and relatives or to  help  their\r\n\r\nchildren to look after their grandchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the MCIT and the bus companies may be\r\n\r\nconcerned  that  after the relaxation, senior  citizens  will\r\n\r\ntravel  more  frequently  during  peak  hours  and  the   bus\r\n\r\ncompanies'  income would be reduced.  These  senior  citizens\r\n\r\nare taking buses not only when they are old.  I think many of\r\n\r\nthem  had been taking bus services even during their  younger\r\n\r\ndays.  They are life-time bus commuters!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole day concession has already been implemented in\r\n\r\nEuropean  countries  -  Canada and Hong Kong.  The concession\r\n\r\nto  senior  citizens is only a small gesture of  respect  for\r\n\r\nthem.  It is not completely free.  It is only a concession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope MCIT and the bus companies can reconsider\r\n\r\nthis  issue.   To  start with, perhaps  they  can  extend  it\r\n\r\nfurther by one more hour, say, from 9 am, instead of  10  am.\r\n\r\nAfter all, after 9 am, it is not the peak period.  Later  on,\r\n\r\nthey  can  monitor  the situation and extend  the  concession\r\n\r\nperiod to the whole day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, first, let me\r\n\r\ndeclare  that I am a member of the Public Transport  Council,\r\n\r\nbut I am not speaking on behalf of the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of public transport for Jurong Island, I\r\n\r\nwant  to say that Jurong Island is an impressive development.\r\n\r\nJust  looking  at  the sand that is poured into  the  sea  to\r\n\r\nreclaim  land, it must have cost billions of dollars   -   $5\r\n\r\nbillion or more.  And just driving around looking at the  oil\r\n\r\nrefineries, chemical plants, petrochemical complexes and  the\r\n\r\nutility providers, it must also amount to billions of dollars\r\n\r\nof  investments   -  $10-$20 billion, a lot  of  investments.\r\n\r\nAll  these investments can only yield returns with the people\r\n\r\nwho are working there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that lots of incentives and privileges are\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the companies in Jurong Island.  However,  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  public  transport for the workers  to  man  the\r\n\r\nplants  and  industries, more could be done.  At the  present\r\n\r\nmoment,  the  public  transport  that  goes  there  uses  the\r\n\r\nfarecard system.  But our people who use the farecard have to\r\n\r\npay  10 cents more than normal fares.  And the reason is that\r\n\r\nthe buses that ply there have to pay COE, and the workers pay\r\n\r\nfor the COE.  But for the rest of Singapore, because they are\r\n\r\npublic  roads, the SBS and TIBS buses do not have to pay  for\r\n\r\nCOE.  I think this is an anomaly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have driven along Jurong Island. I do not see the\r\n\r\nroads in Jurong Island any different from the roads in Jurong\r\n\r\nIndustrial Estate or, for that matter, the rest of Singapore.\r\n\r\nSo  why should Jurong Island workers have to pay for COE when\r\n\r\nthe  rest of us do not have to?  Moreover, we say that we are\r\n\r\ngoing to have a world-class transport system.  I think world-class transport system must include bringing workers to  work\r\n\r\nas  quickly as possible, as cheaply as possible and as safely\r\n\r\nas  possible.   And it must also mean allowing them  to  come\r\n\r\nhome quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that there will be a review of the system\r\n\r\nand  there  will be improvements in the public transport  for\r\n\r\nJurong  Island  workers.    And  I  hope  it  will  be   more\r\n\r\nconvenient, cheap and more comfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I want to inform hon.

Dr John Chen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, Mr Ang Mong Seng has asked\r\n\r\nthat the public transport concession rates for the elderly be\r\n\r\nextended  either to 9.00 am or for the full day.  The  public\r\n\r\ntransport  operators had introduced concessionary travel  for\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens  to  help  defray transport  costs  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly  who  are  retired.  The concessionary  fares  apply,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  only  during off-peak hours to  encourage  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  to travel during these times, instead of adding  to\r\n\r\nthe crowd going to and from work and school.  This is because\r\n\r\nbeing retirees, they have greater flexibility in timing their\r\n\r\ntravel.   If they travel in great numbers during peak  hours,\r\n\r\nthen the bus companies will have to put on more buses because\r\n\r\nof  the higher demand.  That is costly.  So I think it  is  a\r\n\r\nwin-win  situation under the current arrangement because  the\r\n\r\ntime of the retirees is more flexible and therefore they  can\r\n\r\ntake  their  time to travel during off peak hours  and  enjoy\r\n\r\nconcessionary fares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the operators have been sympathetic to\r\n\r\nrequests  for the concessionary travel period to be extended.\r\n\r\nAnd  as  Mr Ang has mentioned, they have brought forward  the\r\n\r\nstarting  time  on Saturdays from 2.30 pm to  10.00  am.  The\r\n\r\npublic transport operators will continue to review the scheme\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to time, and to decide whether it is  viable  and\r\n\r\nsustainable in the long term to extend the concession to full\r\n\r\nday travel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas raised the issue of public transport in Jurong\r\n\r\nIsland.  I would like to give the House the background.   The\r\n\r\nPTC  called  for an open tender for bus services  for  Jurong\r\n\r\nIsland, because of the unique transport demand pattern there.\r\n\r\nServices  are concentrated within the peak periods with  very\r\n\r\nlittle  ridership outside the peak periods.   Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nPTC  decided  to call for an open tender, as an  open  tender\r\n\r\nwould promote competition and ensure that the operator offers\r\n\r\nthe most competitive rates for those travel demand patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBS won the contract to run the Jurong Island bus\r\n\r\nservices,  which  commenced operations  in  June  2000.   The\r\n\r\ncontract is for three years with an option for a further\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextension of  two years.  SBS competed on the same  basis  as\r\n\r\nother   tenderers  with  non-exempt  COE  buses.   The  other\r\n\r\ntenderers are private operators.  And these buses are not COE-exempt,  because  the  successful  tenderer  will  not   have\r\n\r\nuniversal  service obligation.  So we could  have  a  private\r\n\r\noperator  winning the tender and that private  operator  will\r\n\r\nnot  have  to  operate other routes that are not  profitable,\r\n\r\nlike  the  two public bus companies.  The successful operator\r\n\r\ncould also redeploy the buses for other uses outside the peak\r\n\r\nhours  in  order to reduce cost.  This is the  background  to\r\n\r\nwhat has happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to inform the Member that the PTC will\r\n\r\nreview the matter nearer the expiry of SBS' contract.  I know\r\n\r\nwhat the Member is requesting.  He is requesting for the same\r\n\r\nfare like the other parts of Singapore and therefore it is 10\r\n\r\ncents  cheaper.   We  will ask the PTC to review  the  matter\r\n\r\nnearer  the date.  By that time, Jurong Island will  also  be\r\n\r\nmore   developed  and  the  ridership  position  should  have\r\n\r\nimproved, and we  will ask the PTC to review it favourably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto provide an update to the House on the state of development\r\n\r\nof  the Pasir Panjang Terminal.

Will the Minister enlighten the House on how  they\r\n\r\nintend  to  fully utilise this planned capacity  in  the  two\r\n\r\nterminals?  One is a newly built one and the other  has  been\r\n\r\nin existence for many years.  Obviously, the armotisation and\r\n\r\ndepreciation  charges are different, but given the  state  of\r\n\r\nport competition internationally and regionally, what are the\r\n\r\nplans  in respect of Pasir Panjang Terminal vis-a-vis  Keppel\r\n\r\nTerminal?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, Pasir Panjang Terminal\r\n\r\nfirst started operations in October 1997.  Today, it has  six\r\n\r\nberths\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  15-metre  draft  which can handle the  world's  largest\r\n\r\ncontainer  ships.  In 2000, Pasir Panjang Terminal handled  2\r\n\r\nmillion   TEUs,  or  about  12%  of  PSA's  total   container\r\n\r\nthroughput.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terminal uses cutting-edge technology such as remote\r\n\r\nBridge Crane System which allows operators to control  up  to\r\n\r\nfour  Bridge  Cranes  via remote control  at  any  one  time,\r\n\r\ngreatly boosting flexibility and productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pasir Panjang Terminal will be further developed as\r\n\r\nthe  need  arises.  The total capacity of the  terminal  when\r\n\r\nfully  developed is not 30 million, but 35 million TEUs.   We\r\n\r\nwill  look  at the demand for port services and  see  whether\r\n\r\nthere is a need for further development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> Sir, thank you for the replies.

I would like to ask the Ministry to\r\n\r\nconsider  whether taxis could be allowed to go into  the  bus\r\n\r\nlanes,  not to drive for long distances but just to  pick  up\r\n\r\nand  drop  off passengers.  I raise this because,  given  the\r\n\r\ncompetition among taxi companies, complaints by customers are\r\n\r\ntaken  very seriously, recorded and demerit points  given  to\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers  who  do  not  provide  service  according   to\r\n\r\ncustomers' wishes.  A taxi driver  risks  the cancellation of\r\n\r\nhis taxi rental agreement if he is not up to stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the complaints by customers is that taxi drivers\r\n\r\ndo  not pick them up or drop them off in the bus lane.   This\r\n\r\nis  compounded in situations where the bus lanes run  for  an\r\n\r\nentire stretch of the road.  Some passengers do not or refuse\r\n\r\nto appreciate that it is against the law for taxi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrivers to do so during restricted hours.  This can result in\r\n\r\na  complaint  being  made  against  that  taxi  driver.   The\r\n\r\ncomplaint  may not be directly about not being picked  up  or\r\n\r\ndropped  off in the bus lane.  But when one is upset,  it  is\r\n\r\neasy  to  complain  about  rudeness, inconvenience  or  extra\r\n\r\ncharges.   At  times,  the  taxi  driver  complies  with  the\r\n\r\ncustomer's  request, goes into the bus lane and  risks  being\r\n\r\ncaught, because he does not wish to be complained against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it does not take much time for a taxi to enter the\r\n\r\nbus  lane to pick up or to drop off passengers.  I think this\r\n\r\nshould  also  facilitate  better  taxi  service  and  a  more\r\n\r\nsatisfied customer.  I hope the Ministry will consider this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as I have explained to\r\n\r\nProf.  Chin just now why we could not allow taxis to use  the\r\n\r\nbus  lane  not  just for driving but even for picking  up  or\r\n\r\ndropping  off passengers, because the number of  buses  using\r\n\r\nthe  bus  lanes is voluminous.  For instance, if we have  130\r\n\r\nbuses per hour, that is every half a minute there will  be  a\r\n\r\nbus  travelling.  And if you have 18,000 taxis, even for just\r\n\r\npicking  up  or dropping off passengers, it will  affect  the\r\n\r\nsmooth  flow of bus operation.  So the answer is that we  are\r\n\r\nnot prepared at this point in time to allow taxis to pick  up\r\n\r\nor drop off passengers in bus lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his concern about passengers wrongly accusing the\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers just because the taxi drivers did not allow them\r\n\r\nto drop off in the bus lane, I can assure the Member that LTA\r\n\r\ninvestigates  every  complaint very carefully  and  will  not\r\n\r\npress  charges against the drivers for offences that are  not\r\n\r\ncommitted by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4), Dr Toh See Kiat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I just have five points\r\n\r\nto make where promoting e-commerce is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to ask the Minister if funds for\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  trade  associations to promote  Singapore  e-business   and their own companies or to represent  Singapore\r\n\r\nin  international bodies like the International  Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce and the United Nations' CEFACT; whether these  funds\r\n\r\ncould be used to help them represent Singapore just like  TDB\r\n\r\nuses   funds  to  promote  Singapore  business  by  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question is: the National Trust Council has been\r\n\r\nannounced by the Minister and this will promote Singapore  as\r\n\r\na  trusted e-hub.  I wonder if there are enough funds to make\r\n\r\nsure that the National Trust Council would operate to deliver\r\n\r\nsuch a very big task to success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third question, Sir, is: the content industry, which I\r\n\r\nmentioned yesterday, needs a lot of encouragement, grants and\r\n\r\ntax  rebates.  There  are a lot of things  that  the  content\r\n\r\nindustry  needs, for example, in film animation  and  perhaps\r\n\r\neven  in electronic publications, grants and perhaps  a  more\r\n\r\nliberal  seed funding and venture capital scheme, and venture\r\n\r\ncapitalists could also be given tax breaks to allow  them  to\r\n\r\nabsorb  some  of  the losses that may happen in  experimental\r\n\r\nventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth question, Sir: the policies we need to attract\r\n\r\ntalent  for  this  development of  the  IT  and  the  content\r\n\r\nindustry for e-commerce may need to be liberalised.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has certain rules like if  somebody  is\r\n\r\nearning  more  than  $3,500  a month,  he  probably  gets  an\r\n\r\nemployment pass much easier.  But I think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  are pricing ourselves out of the market if we say that it\r\n\r\nhas got to be $3,500 and no less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth question: I think competition rules have got to\r\n\r\nbe  stricter because sometimes the big boys may want to  kill\r\n\r\noff  the  SMEs  with their predatory practices and  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  One highway is choked because there  is  only  one\r\n\r\naccess provider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second cut on funding of IT projects, I have two\r\n\r\nquestions  for the Minister on the funds that  VWOs  and  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association would need to help bridge  the  digital\r\n\r\ndivide,  I  hope  that the Minister can  give  some  idea  of\r\n\r\nwhether  and  how  these funds could be  channelled  in  that\r\n\r\ndirection,  so that the various groups of people  who  cannot\r\n\r\naccess the Internet can be helped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, Sir, is particularly for those who\r\n\r\nare  disabled.   We  have in our midst some  people  who  are\r\n\r\ndisabled  and associations that help them to cope with  life.\r\n\r\nIT  is  really one of the most important tools that they  can\r\n\r\nuse  to help them live relatively normal lives.  Some of  the\r\n\r\nsoftware   and  hardware  used  by  the  disabled  are   very\r\n\r\nexpensive.  I wonder if the Minister could help channel funds\r\n\r\nfor these VWOs to help the disabled to help themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Prof. Toh See Kiat brought up a\r\n\r\nfew  suggestions.  The first is on promoting e-commerce.   He\r\n\r\nasked  whether funds allocated to trade associations  can  be\r\n\r\nused by them to promote Singapore companies overseas.  I have\r\n\r\nno  idea what specific aspects he is suggesting.  Since trade\r\n\r\npromotion  comes  under TDB, he may  want  to  take  this  up\r\n\r\nfurther with TDB and MTI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on trusted hub, he asked whether the National\r\n\r\nTrust  Council would be given sufficient resources to perform\r\n\r\nits  task.  The National Trust Council has just been  formed.\r\n\r\nThey are now in the process of working out its workplan.   In\r\n\r\nthe event that the Council does require some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunding support, my Ministry is prepared to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, he asked if there is any incentive scheme for\r\n\r\ncompanies  to go into film animation and so on.   Sir,  under\r\n\r\nthe IBBMM (Interactive Broadband Multimedia programme), there\r\n\r\nis  a  sub-programme on New Media.  These companies can apply\r\n\r\nto   the  MCIT  for  funding  support  under  the  New  Media\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh asked if the losses by venture capitalists can\r\n\r\nbe  offset.  Sir, policy on venture capital fund comes  under\r\n\r\nthe purview of MTI and EDB.  He may wish to bring this up  to\r\n\r\nMTI and EDB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he asked whether IT talent earning less than $3,500\r\n\r\nwould  be allowed to come into Singapore.  I am not aware  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a policy on the $3,500 cut-off.  Again if there is  any\r\n\r\nspecific  incidence,  he  is most  welcome  to  bring  to  my\r\n\r\nattention, and I will look into it further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point he asked is whether we have in place some\r\n\r\ncompetition  rules to make sure that the big players  do  not\r\n\r\npenalise  the new start-ups, the SMEs and so on.   Under  the\r\n\r\ncode of practices for open competition, IDA does regulate big\r\n\r\ntelecom companies from two angles.  Firstly, the network must\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  inter-operate.  Secondly, we  do  require  open\r\n\r\naccess to all infrastructures.  So in the event that you hear\r\n\r\nof  any SMEs that are being penalised by the big telcos,  you\r\n\r\nare  most welcome to bring up to the attention of IDA.  As  a\r\n\r\nregulator, they would look into the specific incidence  under\r\n\r\nthe code of practices for open competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On digital divide, Prof. Toh asked whether there is any\r\n\r\nfunding support for the VWOs to implement programmes targeted\r\n\r\nat  the  disabled Singaporeans.  Sir, I am happy to say  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  indeed a programme where IDA works  with  NCSS  to\r\n\r\nprovide  funding  support to refurbish used PCs  and  develop\r\n\r\nsoftware and applications targeted at the disabled people.  I\r\n\r\nassure  him that more funding support will be forthcoming  as\r\n\r\nand when the need arises.  At this moment, there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunding support available and the funding has not been  fully\r\n\r\nused up yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc.

At one time, it used to  be  said  in\r\n\r\nBritain  that the doors of the courts there were as  open  as\r\n\r\nthe Savoy, which was a very expensive hotel in the Strand  in\r\n\r\nthose  days.   Are we going to say that our court  doors  are\r\n\r\nalso open to the public, just as Raffles Hotel is open to the\r\n\r\npublic for them to go in and use the hotel?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, justice must be made available to all members of\r\n\r\nthe public, that goes without saying.  If it is not, then  it\r\n\r\nis a denial of justice to a substantial sector of our people.\r\n\r\nIf  I  may just quote a few fees at random.  If you  want  to\r\n\r\ntake an appeal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Subordinate Courts to High Court - it is  a  civil\r\n\r\nappeal  -  you  have to pay $600, just to file  a  Notice  of\r\n\r\nAppeal.  I do not know why that is necessary - $600 to file a\r\n\r\nNotice  of Appeal.  And if you take an appeal from  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt to the Court of Appeal, it is $1,000 to file the Notice\r\n\r\nof  Appeal.   That  is  not all.  If  you  want  to  make  an\r\n\r\napplication   to  the  Court  of  Appeal,  an   interlocutory\r\n\r\napplication  concerning the appeal that you have  before  the\r\n\r\nCourt of Appeal, then it is $1,000 again; and similarly  with\r\n\r\nthe Subordinate Courts, if you wish to make an application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in an appeal to the Court of Appeal, a sum of\r\n\r\n$3,000  has to be paid to file your case to be argued  before\r\n\r\nthe  Court  of  Appeal.  May I know what is the justification\r\n\r\nfor  these  fees in our courts?  Are the courts in  business?\r\n\r\nHave they been told that they must pay their way for the work\r\n\r\nthey  do, or is it the policy of this Government to see  that\r\n\r\neveryone, regardless of his wealth, regardless of his income,\r\n\r\nis  able to take his complaint or grievance to the courts and\r\n\r\nas  cheaply  as is possible?  Justice is an important  factor\r\n\r\nand  has  a  very  important  role  in  keeping  the  society\r\n\r\ntogether.   If  a  number of people feel  denied  of  justice\r\n\r\nbecause  they cannot afford the fees to take their  cases  to\r\n\r\nthe  courts, then clearly, they will be right in  saying,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, it is very difficult to get any justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So may I know from the Minister, or whoever is replying,\r\n\r\nwhat  is the justification, what is the rationale, for  these\r\n\r\nhigh fees in the courts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I ask why - I asked this of the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  and  he  says,  \"you  better  table  another\r\n\r\nquestion\",  I do not know why - is it that the courts  refuse\r\n\r\nto  accept cash in payment of these fees?  It makes  it  more\r\n\r\ndifficult, more inconvenient for people if they do not have a\r\n\r\ncash  card or a credit card.  Cash is legal tender.  Why  are\r\n\r\nthe  courts refusing to accept cash, making it more difficult\r\n\r\nfor the public?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Other countries which are not  doing  it\r\n\r\nare  also  considering  doing it, for example,  Malaysia.

There are also other disbursements.   Sir,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  having  to  pay court fees  will  discourage  any\r\n\r\nlitigant from going to court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of course is, with the vast array of\r\n\r\nalternative dispute resolution processes available, one  can,\r\n\r\ninstead  of dragging out one's case in court, turn  to  these\r\n\r\nalternatives.  Even for appeals from the High  Court  to  the\r\n\r\nCourt of Appeal, like I have said, in a civil case, the Court\r\n\r\nof Appeal will sit with three judges.  Even if you pay $3,000\r\n\r\nto  have  your case heard, and $10,000 security for costs,  I\r\n\r\nthink it is justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

This question  is\r\n\r\nprompted by the questions that I have raised in this House no\r\n\r\nless  than  three  times.   The first,  of  course,  was  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Public Prosecutor not to prosecute the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, the Deputy Prime Ministers and others who, we  say,\r\n\r\nquite clearly broke the law on Polling Day.  I know there was\r\n\r\nan answer given, but that was given by the Minister of State,\r\n\r\nI  think.   But the Minister of State can only guess  at  the\r\n\r\nreasons behind the decision of the Public Prosecutor.  It  is\r\n\r\ntime  that  the  Public Prosecutor, when the public  interest\r\n\r\ndemands  a  prosecution, that he explains why he has  decided\r\n\r\nnot to prosecute.  What are the reasons?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It comes to my mind some time ago when the Attorney-General of Malaysia had to hold a press conference to explain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy  he  did  not  prefer charges against  the  former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  or  Head of Malacca State.

It is one that will help to transform\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economy  to  a  knowledge-based  one.    Staying\r\n\r\ncompetitive and well-trained, indeed, retrained - that is the\r\n\r\nmessage  to all who seek to benefit from this year's  Budget,\r\n\r\nwhatever sector they may be in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is also the focus that the GPC for Law will be\r\n\r\ntaking in this Committee of Supply.  Members in the GPC  will\r\n\r\nbe  covering  issues  that involve  the  supply  of  lawyers,\r\n\r\ntraining  and retraining for lawyers in the new economy,  and\r\n\r\nthe cost of access to legal services.  At the end of the day,\r\n\r\nwe  are  aiming for a strong legal system which is  not  just\r\n\r\nefficient or high-tech, but one that delivers justice to  all\r\n\r\nwho  seek it, whether they be foreign or local, poor or rich,\r\n\r\nat  reasonable  cost.  Indeed, the need for  a  strong  legal\r\n\r\nsystem  is  paramount  to  a knowledge-based  and  globalised\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence and trust in the legal system is generated\r\n\r\nnot  only  in the accolades given to it by outside  agencies,\r\n\r\nalthough the positive reviews of the judiciary and the  legal\r\n\r\nsystem  generally do Singapore proud.  It lies in the  impact\r\n\r\nthat  it has over the lives of those who come before it;   it\r\n\r\nlies  in the unrepresented defendant, for example, who, after\r\n\r\nhis  day  in court, accepts the decision, regardless  of  the\r\n\r\nconsequences to him;  it lies in the feelings of the divorced\r\n\r\ncouple,  that after all is said and done, they felt  that  it\r\n\r\nwas   the   best  that  could  be  expected  from  a   broken\r\n\r\nrelationship;  it lies in the mouth of the foreign CEO  of  a\r\n\r\nmultinational  corporation  who,  after  resolution  with   a\r\n\r\ndispute  with  a  local  company, nonetheless  professes  his\r\n\r\nconfidence  and trust in the Singapore legal system,  whether\r\n\r\nthe  outcome of the case is favourable or not to him  or  his\r\n\r\ncorporation.  Such confidence, Sir, can only be  obtained  if\r\n\r\nthe system itself were to constantly upgrade, especially in a\r\n\r\nchanging  world.  Lawyers must be seen to represent  clients'\r\n\r\ninterests soundly and firmly, judges must be seen to dispense\r\n\r\njustice fairly, the cost of access to justice must not be  so\r\n\r\nprohibitive as to deny parties from their day in court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to ensure that there are sufficient lawyers\r\n\r\nin Singapore, such that costs are kept at a reasonable level.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same  time, there must be a realisation  that,  with\r\n\r\nglobalisation, there is a demand for Singapore lawyers beyond\r\n\r\nour shores.  Law graduates are also in demand in jobs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutside  of  the  legal sector.  Legal  training  provides  a\r\n\r\ncertain  measure  of versatility.  This is reflected  in  the\r\n\r\nlarge  proportion of law graduates who do not enter into  the\r\n\r\nprofession  and  legal service, despite the  relatively  high\r\n\r\nsalaries for newly qualified lawyers.  For those who  are  in\r\n\r\nthe  profession,  there is a need to  ensure  that  they  are\r\n\r\nconstantly  retraining, so that they  can  better  serve  the\r\n\r\ndemands of a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what is the legal\r\n\r\nframework that has been put in place to facilitate the growth\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's knowledge-based economy.  What are the  plans\r\n\r\nfor  increasing the number of lawyers in Singapore so  as  to\r\n\r\nalleviate   the  tight  market  conditions   that   are   now\r\n\r\nprevailing?  Would the Minister support the development of  a\r\n\r\nTechnology  Law  and Policy Centre that could  spearhead  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  Singapore  as  a  hub  for  high-tech  legal\r\n\r\nservices?   I  ask this because there is a  need  to  have  a\r\n\r\ncatalyst for legal training and legal research, especially in\r\n\r\nthe  areas  of information technology law, telecommunications\r\n\r\nlaw and biotechnology law.  Such a centre may be located at a\r\n\r\nlocal  university, but linked to other institutions  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  Academy of Law and the Law Society.  Together,  such  an\r\n\r\ninstitution can focus on developing Singapore's position as a\r\n\r\ncentre  for  high quality legal services.  Such a centre  can\r\n\r\nassist  also  in  the formulation of legal policies  for  the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone in Singapore has been urged to adjust to\r\n\r\nthe  demands of a knowledge-based economy.  The legal  system\r\n\r\nand  the legal profession are not immune from the transition,\r\n\r\nand  Singapore's laws and its legal institutions must respond\r\n\r\nswiftly to the challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

For the New Economy, we must have a legal  system\r\n\r\nwhich strongly protects the fruits of the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Government's credit, much of our intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty  laws have been reformed to bring them  up  to  date\r\n\r\nwith the advances in the rest of the world.  We have also set\r\n\r\nup  special  teams  in the police to deal  with  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty  offences,  as we realise that good  laws  are  only\r\n\r\nplatitudes if not strictly enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, the EDB and the TDB work hard to bring\r\n\r\ninvestors and traders to Singapore, and many come along  with\r\n\r\ntheir  intellectual assets.  Yet our image in  the  world  is\r\n\r\nstill  not  very  good.  Though we are no longer  the  piracy\r\n\r\ncapital of the world, we are still seen as a place where  the\r\n\r\nlong  arm  of the law seems to be impotent against those  who\r\n\r\nsteal  intellectual property rights (IPRs).  This is regarded\r\n\r\nas  due to a lack of will, as we boast one of the best police\r\n\r\nforces in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stock answers given to investors who call for\r\n\r\nstricter  intellectual  property laws  and  concerted  police\r\n\r\naction are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We have laws as good as any in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.

Yet  others operate blatantly  from  permanent\r\n\r\npremises in shops and booths in shopping malls.  Their  goods\r\n\r\nare ridiculously cheap and packaged in flimsy fashion.  Is it\r\n\r\nso difficult to ascertain that their goods have infringed the\r\n\r\nlaw?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is time to change our intellectual property\r\n\r\nlaws  radically.

On top of that, we can impose a\r\n\r\nsort  of  occupier's liability on landlords and  tenants  who\r\n\r\nrent out or sublet premises to others who are pirates or  who\r\n\r\nare  found to be selling or manufacturing pirated goods.

And they  must  be  made  to  pay\r\n\r\nroyalties to the rightful IPR owners, with interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no longer a good excuse to say, \"No other country\r\n\r\nin  the  world has such laws, so we cannot be so  draconian.\"\r\n\r\nIf  we aspire to be a developed country, then we must realise\r\n\r\nthat no other developed country has so extensive a problem of\r\n\r\npiracy  as  we  do.

Hence,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nensure that there are enough lawyers of the right calibre  to\r\n\r\nprovide the necessary support for our growing economy.  Also,\r\n\r\nin  the light of the trend towards globalisation and the need\r\n\r\nto  bring  in a wide range of expertise and experience,  will\r\n\r\nthe  Government consider recognising law degrees  other  than\r\n\r\nthose   from   the  United  Kingdom?   Given  the  increasing\r\n\r\ncomplexity of issues which lawyers have to deal with in  this\r\n\r\nfast-changing  world  of business, will the  Government  also\r\n\r\nconsider  recognising  joint  degrees  instead  of  pure  law\r\n\r\ndegrees?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, I find myself in the\r\n\r\nunusual  position of arguing for more lawyers  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I think there is a clear need for a  sufficient\r\n\r\nnumber  of  lawyers,  and of the right quality,  to  maintain\r\n\r\nSingapore's position as a premier financial and business hub.\r\n\r\nAnd, there is both a quantitative and a qualitative dimension\r\n\r\nto this need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the quantitative side, as Mr Chng Hee Kok has also\r\n\r\nmentioned,  media  reports would  suggest  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nsqueeze on the number of lawyers in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore,  partly because several young lawyers are  leaving\r\n\r\nthe  profession  and  it would also manifest  itself  in  the\r\n\r\nrising  starting pay of lawyers.  Meanwhile, the  demand  for\r\n\r\nlegal  services has been rising, in tandem with  our  growth,\r\n\r\nboth  economically and in specific niche areas.   These,  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  phenomenon of globalisation, would mean that  more\r\n\r\nlawyers trained in Singapore and practising in Singapore  are\r\n\r\nin  demand  not just here but elsewhere as well.  I  believe,\r\n\r\nwith  more  local firms striking alliances with international\r\n\r\nlaw firms, this will further accelerate that demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the qualitative side, we need different types of\r\n\r\nlawyers.   The  plain vanilla litigator or corporate  finance\r\n\r\nlawyer  is,  on one hand, important to the traditional  legal\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   On  the  other hand, as  we  go  into  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy,  we need lawyers who have the knowledge in  specific\r\n\r\nareas  of science, engineering, and also in certain new areas\r\n\r\nbut  relating  to  these disciplines,  such  as  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty  rights, those that come under the WTO arrangements,\r\n\r\nand the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, Sir, our supply of lawyers in Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  been, to some extent, constrained.  I know that in 1993,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  appointed a committee which recommended  that,\r\n\r\nbesides  NUS  law  degrees,  only  law  degrees  from  15  UK\r\n\r\nuniversities  be  recognised for admission to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBar.  In addition, the graduates from the UK are required  to\r\n\r\nattain  at  least  a Second Upper Honours degree,  while  NUS\r\n\r\ngraduates  are  required to attain at least  a  Second  Lower\r\n\r\nHonours   degree.    I  believe  that  the   Committee   also\r\n\r\nrecommended that the situation be reviewed periodically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I gather that the Committee chaired by the Attorney-General has recently reviewed the situation and I understand\r\n\r\nthat  the  Attorney  General's Committee  has  submitted  its\r\n\r\nreport  to the Government.  May I ask the Minister  what  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  that  Committee  are  and  whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will accept\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations.  In particular, given the  need  for  a\r\n\r\nwide  range of expertise and experience in Singapore, can  we\r\n\r\nbroaden  the  pool  of universities from which  we  recognise\r\n\r\nqualified lawyers?  Also, can we exercise greater flexibility\r\n\r\nin  recognising those who do dual degrees, perhaps in Science\r\n\r\nand  Law, Engineering and Law, Accountancy and Law,  and  the\r\n\r\nlike?  Some institutions also offer shorter courses in law, a\r\n\r\n2-year course or so, for those who already have a degree  and\r\n\r\nprofessional  experience but wanting  to  acquire  the  legal\r\n\r\nknowledge in order to better apply that in specific  context.\r\n\r\nWould those be recognised?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, recently, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan\r\n\r\nsuggested  that law could be considered being  offered  as  a\r\n\r\npost-graduate programme.  I would like to know whether  there\r\n\r\nare any developments in that regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I will\r\n\r\ntake  the  points raised by the GPC Chairman, Prof. Chin,  Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran and Mr Chng Hee Kok because they are related,  and  I\r\n\r\nwill then reply to Prof. Toh See Kiat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Prof. Chin asked about the framework of our legal\r\n\r\nsystem,  what changes are we making to gear up  for  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.   Let  me say first that, as a general principle  in\r\n\r\nour  approach  to  the legal system, we  consider  the  legal\r\n\r\nsystem  to  be important, not just for our people's security,\r\n\r\nsafety  and resolution of disputes.  A sound legal  system  - and   by  that,  I  mean  all  sectors,  the  private   legal\r\n\r\nprofession,  the  legal  profession, the  judiciary  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector's  legal services -  is a critical  supporting\r\n\r\npillar   of   our  economic  growth  to  ensure   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   A legal system, which has  people  in  all\r\n\r\nsectors of competence, of integrity, with a sufficient number\r\n\r\nof skilled people, is essential.  That has been our approach,\r\n\r\nand  in  response  to  Prof. Chin, I would  say  that  it  is\r\n\r\nprobably  even more important now when advances in technology\r\n\r\nand  globalisation have transformed the way we live and work.\r\n\r\nHe  is  right  that no sector, and certainly  not  the  legal\r\n\r\nsector, is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimmune  from  these changes.  Therefore, I  completely  agree\r\n\r\nwith him when he says that the legal system, if it is to play\r\n\r\na  role  in  the  new  economy, must be geared  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nchallenges ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, where do we start in explaining the various aspects\r\n\r\nof  the  framework which we are attending to?  I  will  first\r\n\r\nstart  with  the  question of talents because  if  the  legal\r\n\r\nsystem  does  not have enough skilled persons and  sufficient\r\n\r\nnumbers, it would not be able to rise to the challenge.  Here\r\n\r\nis  where  I  will deal with questions of supply  of  lawyers\r\n\r\nwhich all the three MPs have touched on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, with the Attorney General's Committee,\r\n\r\nwhich I would refer to as the first Committee, we revised the\r\n\r\nsystem  on supply of lawyers and we had the system  where  15\r\n\r\nuniversities  in  the  United Kingdom were  recognised.   For\r\n\r\nthose who wish to practise law in Singapore, they must have a\r\n\r\nSecond  Class (Upper) Honours Degree and they must do a  one-year  Diploma  course  here.  We also provided  for  NUS  law\r\n\r\ngraduates to practise law if they have a Second Class (Lower)\r\n\r\nDegree.   Since some years had passed, we asked the Attorney-General  to form a new Committee to review the situation  and\r\n\r\nto  propose  changes  necessary  in  the  light  of  changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  The Attorney-General has presented the report\r\n\r\nof his Committee.  Let me say that he found that there is now\r\n\r\na  current  shortage  of lawyers, largely  due  to  increased\r\n\r\ndemand  for lawyers brought about by the formation  of  joint\r\n\r\nlaw  ventures and formal alliances, as well as the fact  that\r\n\r\nincreased  numbers  of  lawyers are leaving  the  profession,\r\n\r\neither to become in-house counsel or to pursue other careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, based on projections concerning the size of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore population and the growth of the economy in the\r\n\r\ncoming years, the Committee concluded that there would be  an\r\n\r\nincreased  demand for legal services over the next 10  years.\r\n\r\nTo  help meet the projected increase in demand, the Committee\r\n\r\nhad  recommended increasing the annual intake of law students\r\n\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  NUS  Law  Faculty, as well as increasing the  number  of\r\n\r\noverseas  universities whose law degrees would be  recognised\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of practising in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring a wider range of perspective and experiences to\r\n\r\nour  legal  talent  pool, the Committee  has  recommended  to\r\n\r\ninclude  some  Australian and New Zealand universities  among\r\n\r\nthe  overseas universities to be recognised.  In addition  to\r\n\r\nthe  15  universities,  other universities  from  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  would  be  added to the list.   In  all,  19  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  universities, 4 Australian universities  and  2  New\r\n\r\nZealand  universities will be recognised  for  this  purpose.\r\n\r\nThis  meets  the point raised by Mr Chng Hee Kok about  other\r\n\r\nuniversities to be included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress, and Mr Iswaran made an important point,\r\n\r\nthat  this exercise is not just about numbers.  It must  also\r\n\r\nbe  about  quality.   We  must ensure that  people  of  right\r\n\r\nstandards   and  capabilities  enter  the  legal  profession.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we will continue to insist on Second Class (Upper)\r\n\r\nHonours Degree for graduates from the United Kingdom, and for\r\n\r\nthe  Australian and New Zealand universities, because not all\r\n\r\nof  them  grade their degrees in the same way as  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  universities,  the  Committee  recommended  that  it\r\n\r\nrequires  graduates for purposes of practice to  come  within\r\n\r\nthe  top 30% of their graduating cohort.  The Committee  also\r\n\r\nmade  two  other recommendations.  First, it recommended  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of  Legal  Education be allowed to  recognise  certain\r\n\r\ndouble degree programmes from scheduled universities for  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of admission to the Singapore Bar.   I  think  this\r\n\r\nrecognises the point made by Mr Iswaran about the complicated\r\n\r\nenvironment   of  the  future  where  lawyers   with   inter-disciplinary backgrounds would be an asset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also recognises the importance of the\r\n\r\nBoard  of  Legal Education  being given wider  discretion  to\r\n\r\nrecognise as qualified persons those with multiple skills and\r\n\r\nwide  range of experiences, which will be desirable  for  our\r\n\r\nlegal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsector.  This can also be a route to help meet any short-term\r\n\r\ndemand in any specific area of legal work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should inform the House that the Government has\r\n\r\nconsidered  and accepted the Committee's report, the  details\r\n\r\nof  which  will  be  released  later  today.   These  changes\r\n\r\nrepresent, in my view, a balanced and multi-pronged  approach\r\n\r\nto  ensuring that Singapore has sufficient legal resources to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  continuing needs for its economy.  While  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  our  legal profession continues to take in talents  and\r\n\r\nentrants  of  sufficiently high quality, we will continue  to\r\n\r\nensure that our legal sector will be able to play its part in\r\n\r\nsupporting Singapore's growth and development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran also asked about law being a post-graduate\r\n\r\ndegree.  Let me say that no decision has been taken.   It  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Tony Tan made  a  speech\r\n\r\nwhich  included this point.  But he did not make a definitive\r\n\r\nproposal.  I believe his intention was to provoke thought and\r\n\r\ndiscussion.   I believe he was right in doing so  because  in\r\n\r\nthe  legal  sphere,  just  as in  other  important  areas  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  development, it is absolutely important  to  re-examine fundamental assumptions on which we have operated for\r\n\r\nmany  years.   In  that context, we should  see  whether  our\r\n\r\nscarce  resources are being optimised to the  fullest  extent\r\n\r\nand  is there a better way of doing things.  In that context,\r\n\r\nwe  will  examine whether the law degree should  be  a  post-graduate degree, as well as any other possibilities.  We will\r\n\r\nlook  at all the pros and cons.  One important consideration,\r\n\r\nof  course, is whether the course will be unduly long,  given\r\n\r\nthe  present law course, and whether we can fine-tune  it  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the  benefits  of a graduate  legal  education,  for\r\n\r\nexample, in the United States.  Other aspects which  we  will\r\n\r\nconsider will include the impact of graduate education on the\r\n\r\nquality  of lawyers and the number of entrants to  the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other options, for example, of permitting law\r\n\r\nundergraduates to read law and non-law subjects leading,  for\r\n\r\nexample, to a double degree.  We are still\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexploring  all these possibilities and a decision is  someway\r\n\r\nto go yet.  As I have said, the key approach is not to assume\r\n\r\nthat  what we have been doing all these years and the way  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  doing it is sacrosanct.  We must be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nexamine all aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the point raised by Prof. Chin Tet Yung\r\n\r\non  other steps we have taken on our legal framework, I  need\r\n\r\nto  mention very quickly a major step we took last year about\r\n\r\njoint  ventures and formal alliances.  That was an  important\r\n\r\ndevelopment to bring in top-tier legal talents from  overseas\r\n\r\nto  increase the pool of legal talents in Singapore.  So far,\r\n\r\neight  joint law ventures and two formal alliances have  been\r\n\r\nformed.  Prof. Chin will also remember that in the course  of\r\n\r\nlast year, we have also allowed law firms to corporatise  and\r\n\r\nto  form  themselves as corporations, and this  would  enable\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility for them and in the short space of  time\r\n\r\nsince  we  announced  it  in  October,  at  least  four   law\r\n\r\ncorporations have been formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, an important development was the move we took on\r\n\r\nthe   recommendation  of  former  Justice  Goh  Joon   Seng's\r\n\r\nCommittee  to abolish the conveyancing scale of fees  in  two\r\n\r\nyears'  time.   Apart from the fact that this  will  increase\r\n\r\ncompetition,  it will also have the effect of increasing  the\r\n\r\noverall efficiency of our law firms and we hope that more and\r\n\r\nmore  of  our  lawyers, who are highly skilled professionals,\r\n\r\nwould  shift their focus towards higher value-added  work  as\r\n\r\nconveyancing becomes simpler with technological advances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say in response to Prof. Chin's comments on\r\n\r\ngearing  ourselves to a knowledge-based economy that we  have\r\n\r\nformed  an  inter-agency committee to coordinate  efforts  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  competency and expertise in ICT law.  The  Committee\r\n\r\nwill  explore  and develop new opportunities for  ICT-related\r\n\r\nlegal  services  and in positioning Singapore internationally\r\n\r\nas  a  reputable ICT law centre.  In this regard, let me  say\r\n\r\nthat I would fully support the idea that he has raised of  an\r\n\r\nIT and communication\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaw  centre in the NUS.  I think this would be helpful in the\r\n\r\noverall scheme of gearing up our legal framework for the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on Prof. Toh See Kiat's points on\r\n\r\nintellectual property.  I would say first that we  are  fully\r\n\r\ncommitted  to the protection of intellectual property  rights\r\n\r\nand  we  have developed a three-pronged strategy.  First,  to\r\n\r\nimplement  good  legal framework to protect  IP;  second,  to\r\n\r\nadopt  effective  deterrence and enforcement against  piracy;\r\n\r\nand third, to educate consumers and inculcate in our public a\r\n\r\nculture of respecting intellectual property rights.  He  says\r\n\r\nthat  our image in the world is still  not very good.   I  am\r\n\r\nnot  sure  I agree with him because we have been consistently\r\n\r\nrated as having one of the best IP regimes in the region.  In\r\n\r\nfact,   according  to  the  ASEAN-Pacific   Legal   500,   an\r\n\r\nindependent  survey of regional legal markets, Singapore  has\r\n\r\nthe  strongest and best enforced IP regime in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nHe  also  said  that the long arm of the law in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nimpotent  and  the  police  are  clueless  and  helpless   in\r\n\r\nprosecuting IP offences.  I am not sure I can agree with that\r\n\r\neither.   Of  course, we do not rest on our  laurels  but  he\r\n\r\nshould know that in order to undertake sustained and enhanced\r\n\r\napproach  against  IP  violations,  the  police  set  up   an\r\n\r\nIntellectual Property Rights Branch (IPRB), and the facts are\r\n\r\nthat  the  IPRB  has  smashed seven syndicates  island  wide,\r\n\r\nseized  more  than $16 million worth of pirated articles  and\r\n\r\narrested  187  persons.  This compares  favourably  with  the\r\n\r\nstatistics  in previous years.  Together with these  improved\r\n\r\nenforcement measures, the Singapore courts continue to impose\r\n\r\nstiff  penalties for copyright and trade mark  infringements.\r\n\r\nOffenders  are  consistently given jail  sentences  of  three\r\n\r\nmonths to four years, and fines ranging from $15,000 to  $1.5\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his points about enforcement at trade fairs,\r\n\r\nthese  are licensed by the Ministry of the Environment, which\r\n\r\nspecifically  imposes conditions against  such  malpractices.\r\n\r\nIf he or any other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers  in the House know of such violations at trade  fairs\r\n\r\nin  their  constituencies,  I  hope  they  bring  it  to  the\r\n\r\nattention of the authorities.  But when action is taken, I do\r\n\r\nhope  Prof. Toh See Kiat and other Members do not then  write\r\n\r\nin to the Minister appealing for waiver of the summonses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure taken is the establishment of a new\r\n\r\nstatutory  board called the Intellectual Property  Office  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (IPOS), details of which were given in the  Second\r\n\r\nReading speech on the Bill here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have to raise IPR awareness, and this is\r\n\r\nbeing  done  not  only by IPOS, but also IPOS in  conjunction\r\n\r\nwith   other   international  organisations   in   organising\r\n\r\nworkshops, seminars and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh See Kiat made some proposals on changing our\r\n\r\nlaws.  I am always open to suggestions but, at this stage,  I\r\n\r\ncan only give preliminary response to some of his points.  He\r\n\r\nwanted landlords to be made liable for letting their premises\r\n\r\nto  be  used  for selling pirated goods.  I am  not  sure  we\r\n\r\nreally  would want to expect landlords to constantly  monitor\r\n\r\nthe  activities of their tenants.   Whether we should  go  so\r\n\r\nfar   as  the  Member proposes, to impose  the  liability  on\r\n\r\nlandlords,  is something we have to very carefully  consider.\r\n\r\nAnd  if I may take the analogy of theft, since IPR piracy has\r\n\r\nalways been made an analogy with theft, there is presently no\r\n\r\nlandlord liability provision concerning sale of stolen goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also proposed introducing presumptions, eg, if\r\n\r\nsomebody  is  selling IPR goods at very  low  prices,  he  is\r\n\r\ndeemed   to  be  engaging in piracy.   Here  again,  we  will\r\n\r\nconsider  his  suggestion, but I would  be  very  careful  in\r\n\r\nmaking  such a wide presumption that might affect  legitimate\r\n\r\nbusiness activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to give time for the other cuts, I will\r\n\r\npause here and let other Members speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, one of the desired\r\n\r\noutcomes  stated  in the Budget for the Ministry  of  Law  is\r\n\r\naccessibility to justice for persons of limited means.   This\r\n\r\nis  the  basis  for  Singapore's Legal Aid Bureau  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier, the quality of a legal system is\r\n\r\nto  be  found  in  how accessible it is  to  those  who  seek\r\n\r\njustice.   If  costs  are prohibitive for people  of  limited\r\n\r\nmeans, then the legal system will mean little, no matter  how\r\n\r\nup-to-date it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, in the last decade, has seen impressive\r\n\r\nimprovements  in  the  legal  infrastructure.    The  use  of\r\n\r\ntechnology  has made Singapore's courts the envy of  many  in\r\n\r\nthe  world.   Added to that have been significant changes  in\r\n\r\nthe approaches to the settlement of disputes, whether they be\r\n\r\ncommercial  or personal, criminal or civil.  The  quality  of\r\n\r\nyoung  men and women going into the law is among the best  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   But  all this comes at a cost.   As  Singapore's\r\n\r\nlegal  system  and  procedures develop, we  see  also  rising\r\n\r\ncosts.   Lawyers  now cost more.  Global competition  reduces\r\n\r\nsupply  and drives demand for lawyers.  Procedures  are  more\r\n\r\nelaborate.   Take a simple case in the Family  Division.   An\r\n\r\nuncontested divorce can now cost a couple of thousand dollars\r\n\r\nat least.  A contested one many times more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now mediation sessions to resolve matrimonial\r\n\r\ndisputes.  If lawyers are present, they will charge  for  the\r\n\r\ntime  spent.   Costs increase even though  mediation  may  be\r\n\r\nfree.   It  is  not as if Singapore has a very  sophisticated\r\n\r\nsystem  of  dealing  with  matrimonial  disputes.   In  other\r\n\r\njurisdictions, for example, child counsellors are employed to\r\n\r\nassess  what  would be the best solution to the dispute  from\r\n\r\nthe  viewpoint of the child.  Here, more often than not,  the\r\n\r\njudge  has  to  interview the child or  children  himself  or\r\n\r\nherself.    If  we  institute  such  a  system,  costs   will\r\n\r\nundoubtedly increase further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my GPC colleagues will elaborate further on the\r\n\r\nissue  of legal aid.  But suffice it to say that one  measure\r\n\r\nof the quality of a legal system lies in its ability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto cater to as many of those who seek its assistance.  I hope\r\n\r\nthat the Minister will consider ways and means to improve the\r\n\r\naccess to legal services by reviewing the means test,  so  as\r\n\r\nto allow more lower income people to be assisted by the Legal\r\n\r\nAid  Bureau.   Currently,  the  disposable  income  limit  is\r\n\r\n$7,000.   Given  the rise in income levels  in  Singapore  in\r\n\r\nrecent  years, I would like to suggest that it should  easily\r\n\r\nbe  doubled,  say,  to $14,000, and that there  should  be  a\r\n\r\ncorresponding  increase  in legal officers  assigned  to  the\r\n\r\nLegal Aid Bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, permit me to acknowledge in this House the\r\n\r\nreal contributions of the dedicated officers in the Legal Aid\r\n\r\nBureau, who often work long and hard to help those who are in\r\n\r\nreal need of their assistance.  They perform both social  and\r\n\r\nprofessional duties with dedication and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the legal aid\r\n\r\nprovided  for  those  who  cannot afford  legal  fees  is  an\r\n\r\nessential  service  for the lower income group  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.   However, there are many cases where  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nneed legal advice and yet fail to qualify for the means test,\r\n\r\nas  set  out  by the Legal Aid and Advice Act.  Although  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  sum of annual income of $7,000, excluding deductible\r\n\r\nitems  such as personal and CPF deductions, works out  to  be\r\n\r\nthe maximum a person earns that can qualify for legal aid  to\r\n\r\nbe  slightly over $1,000 per month,   this is often found  to\r\n\r\nbe  too low.  Because after having to pay HDB instalments  or\r\n\r\nrental  and  providing  for monthly expenses  and  children's\r\n\r\nsupport, he or she would have hardly any money left for legal\r\n\r\nfees,  especially  now that the legal  fees  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector have increased considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to request the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nraising  the  capping  of  the  income  limit.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister should also consider, even after raising the  income\r\n\r\nlimit, exercising flexibility on a case-by-case basis, accept\r\n\r\ndeserving  cases  as  the fee one has  to  pay  for  engaging\r\n\r\nprivate lawyers will still be way beyond some who earn  above\r\n\r\nsuch limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  think  Prof.  Chin  has just outlined  the  high  cost  of\r\n\r\nengaging lawyers in legal cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to request the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nstrengthening  the  Legal Aid Bureau, as  it  may  need  more\r\n\r\nmanpower  to assist those who need help, even after the  case\r\n\r\nhas been settled in court.  I have often come across cases in\r\n\r\nmy  meet-the-people sessions where even after the victim  has\r\n\r\nreceived court judgement, he still requires the services of a\r\n\r\nlawyer  to  take  follow-up action to ensure that  the  court\r\n\r\norder  is  being enforced when the other party defaults,  and\r\n\r\nthe  victim  is at a loss as  to whom to turn to and  how  to\r\n\r\nproceed in order to have the court order enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I would like to declare\r\n\r\nmy  interest as an advocate and solicitor, and that  I  would\r\n\r\nhave an interest in what I am about to say.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of the extent to which we extend legal aid to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans has been discussed several times in this  House.\r\n\r\nI think the primary concern is essentially whether or not the\r\n\r\nmeans  test  under the Legal Aid and Advice Act is  something\r\n\r\nwhich puts many Singaporeans out of reach of legal assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  the  State.  This issue was raised last  year  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  in  his  reply, said that the allowance  given  is\r\n\r\nadequate  because  if  you  put in  the  various  deductions,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans earning $1,200 may qualify for legal aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that, and as was indicated and said\r\n\r\nearlier by my colleague, Prof. Chin, Singaporeans are earning\r\n\r\nhigher   wages,  and  certainly  it  is  not   uncommon   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to earn more than $1,200 a month.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, legal fees have actually gone substantially higher than\r\n\r\nbefore.  A three-day trial in a subordinate court can  easily\r\n\r\nset a party back by $10,000, and even higher if the party has\r\n\r\nto  bear  the other side's legal cost as well.   And  in  our\r\n\r\nlegal system, in the context of criminal prosecution where  a\r\n\r\nparty is able to successfully defend against a charge against\r\n\r\nhim, the ability to recover his legal fees is limited indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the high cost involved in getting legal\r\n\r\nrepresentation, many Singaporeans refrain from seeking  legal\r\n\r\nassistance, if they can help it.  Or they are just not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to do so because of lack of resources.  What happens\r\n\r\nthen  is  that  access to justice is limited  to  those  with\r\n\r\nability to pay, and is denied to those who cannot afford  it.\r\n\r\nIn  short,  those who are charged for criminal  offences  may\r\n\r\ntake the convenient route of pleading guilty, just to get  on\r\n\r\nwith  their  lives.   I  therefore would  like  to  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  consider  making legal  aid  more  flexible  by\r\n\r\nperhaps  giving more discretion to the Director of Legal  Aid\r\n\r\nto  consider each case on its own merits, and not just  using\r\n\r\nthe  means test as a main factor in deciding whether  or  not\r\n\r\none  qualifies.  For instance, a person can be  earning  more\r\n\r\nthan  $3,000  a month, but may be supporting a large  family,\r\n\r\nleaving him with a limited disposable income for any form  of\r\n\r\nfunding for his legal requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, an intermediate assistance scheme where some\r\n\r\nform  of subsidy may be considered.  Presently, the Act  does\r\n\r\nprovide  some  form  of  co-payment.  However,  this  is  not\r\n\r\ncommonly  known  and  if the Director can  establish  certain\r\n\r\nguidelines and criteria for such form of assistance and  have\r\n\r\nthis widely publicised, I think it will allow more members of\r\n\r\nthe  public  to gain access to legal aid.  I would  therefore\r\n\r\nurge the Minister to consider these recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Sir, for sometime now,\r\n\r\nthere  has been considerable discussion about mandatory  jail\r\n\r\nsentences for landlords whose tenants are illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\nI  have asked the Clerk of Parliament to distribute Tables  A\r\n\r\nto  E,  but given the shortage of time, I am not going to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  them, but they compare sentencing in the context  of\r\n\r\nthe Immigration Act contrasted with other Acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point, Sir, as I have listed in Table A, the\r\n\r\noffences for which mandatory sentences have been set out  are\r\n\r\nvery grave  -  mutiny, kidnapping, violent rape\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  so on.  When it comes to other offences, judges have the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  on the sentence to be imposed.  And in  my  view,\r\n\r\nthe  Immigration Act represents a serious erosion  into  that\r\n\r\nprinciple.   The  point  is  that our  landlords  are  to  be\r\n\r\nclassified with mutineers, kidnappers and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the justifications for mandatory jail sentence\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans, in respect of this sort of offences?   The\r\n\r\nthree main ones that have been given are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) that illegal immigrants pose serious social problems;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) that judges are easily swayed by defendants giving\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"excuses\"; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) that a deterrent effect is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that each of these three reasons can be\r\n\r\nchallenged.   First, that illegal immigrants pose  a  serious\r\n\r\nsocial problem.  Agreed, but that does not automatically mean\r\n\r\nthat every landlord who may have been negligent goes to jail.\r\n\r\nThe  flaw with this argument is that it confuses the  offence\r\n\r\nwith the offender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When punishing someone for an offence, there are always\r\n\r\ntwo factors to take into account:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the nature of the offence; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the particular circumstances of the offender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What mandatory sentencing does is to remove one of these\r\n\r\ntwo  factors from the equation.  And the question is: is that\r\n\r\njustified?  That is why we have church deacon, illiterate and\r\n\r\nwidowed  old  ladies  and otherwise morally  faultless  young\r\n\r\naccountants  going to jail.  Surely, we need to  be  able  to\r\n\r\nconsider the circumstances of the individual offender.  And I\r\n\r\nquote  the  Chief Justice when he had to dismiss  the  church\r\n\r\ndeacon's  appeal.  He said, \"I feel sorry for the people  who\r\n\r\nare charged and convicted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point I would make is that flexibility\r\n\r\nin  sentencing  and the ability to show mercy and  compassion\r\n\r\nwhere appropriate is necessary for the proper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunctioning of the criminal justice system.  Let me now  turn\r\n\r\nto  the  second excuse that is often given, that  judges  are\r\n\r\neasily  swayed by defendants giving excuses.  Again,  I  have\r\n\r\ndifficulties with that reasoning.  We have to have  faith  in\r\n\r\nthe  judicial  system's ability to mete out  the  appropriate\r\n\r\npunishment.   And  if  a  punishment  is  inappropriate,  the\r\n\r\nprosecution  can always appeal to the High Court,  where  the\r\n\r\nChief Justice will hear the appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that judges will be able to differentiate\r\n\r\nbetween those who deserve to go to jail and those who do not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now deal with the third reason that is often\r\n\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said sometimes that deterrence is the reason for\r\n\r\nmandatory  jailing.   Again, I do not find  that  convincing.\r\n\r\nDeterrence is almost always an aim for punishment.  But  that\r\n\r\ndoes  not mean automatically that you need to send people  to\r\n\r\njail, regardless of the degree of culpability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Straits Times has over the years been reporting\r\n\r\nall  these  cases, and you would have seen them - the  church\r\n\r\ndeacon, the accountant, the illiterate, the old lady, and  so\r\n\r\non.   Do  they  need to go to jail in order for there  to  be\r\n\r\ndeterrence?  I think one can easily argue otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also said, well, the AG's Chambers will exercise\r\n\r\nits  discretion not to prosecute in appropriate cases.   Sir,\r\n\r\nyou  heard  the  Hon. Minister of State  just  now  that  the\r\n\r\nChambers'  exercise of discretion is not  open  to  scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no accountability.  How would the public  know  in\r\n\r\nwhich  cases the Chambers choose to prosecute and which cases\r\n\r\nthe  Chambers do not choose to prosecute?  That is  why  this\r\n\r\nsort  of  discussion is left to the judges who have  to  make\r\n\r\ntheir  decisions  public,  publish  the  reasoning,  and   if\r\n\r\nsomebody is not happy, either the prosecution or the  accused\r\n\r\ncan always appeal.  Once you leave this sort of discussion to\r\n\r\nthe  prosecution, there is always a question  of   \"has  that\r\n\r\ndiscretion been exercised fairly\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say this legislation, which seeks to send a\r\n\r\nvariety  of  people  to jail without seeking  to  distinguish\r\n\r\nbetween  those  who are negligent and those who  are  morally\r\n\r\nculpable,  has  caused  many  right-thinking  people  to   be\r\n\r\nconcerned.   And  I listened with concern when  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nstand up and say, \"Let's extend this to intellectual property\r\n\r\nrights.   Let's punish other landlords.\"  It  is  a  type  of\r\n\r\nthinking that could lead to a serious erosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask that a change to the law be made as\r\n\r\nsoon as possible.  I note from the Straits Times that it  was\r\n\r\nannounced  last year that the law was being reviewed,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould hope that this be seriously considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, let me first deal with\r\n\r\nsuggestions by Members to raise the legal aid means test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the means test was last revised in October 1995.\r\n\r\nThe key component is the applicant's disposable income, which\r\n\r\nis arrived at after subtracting the allowable deductions from\r\n\r\nhis income.  Currently, the disposable income limit is $7,000\r\n\r\nper  annum  and the allowable deductions are $2,000  for  the\r\n\r\napplicant and $1,000 for each dependant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MinLaw periodically reviews the means test to make legal\r\n\r\naid available to a larger number of low-income applicants.  A\r\n\r\nrecent  review was done, taking into account higher costs  of\r\n\r\nliving  and  increased litigation costs.   I  am  pleased  to\r\n\r\ninform  Members  that,  with  effect  from  1st  April,   the\r\n\r\ndisposable  income  limit will be increased  to  $10,000  per\r\n\r\nannum, not quite the $14,000 the GPC Chairman has asked  for,\r\n\r\nbut  still  a sizeable increase, and the allowance deductions\r\n\r\nfor  calculating the disposable income will be  increased  to\r\n\r\n$3,000 for the applicant and $2,000 for each dependant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give the House a simple illustration as to\r\n\r\nhow   lower  income  Singaporeans  will  benefit  from  these\r\n\r\nincreased limits.  In a family of, say, four, comprising  two\r\n\r\nparents  and  two dependent children where only  the  husband\r\n\r\nworks, the family would qualify\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor legal aid, under the enhanced test, if the father's gross\r\n\r\nmonthly  income is about $1,850 (after making deductions  for\r\n\r\nhimself,  CPF  and  the dependants), provided  the  husband's\r\n\r\ndisposable capital limit comes within $7,000.  That stays  as\r\n\r\na  limit.   Currently,  for  such a family,  the  applicant's\r\n\r\nmonthly income must not exceed about $1,200 for the family to\r\n\r\nqualify  for legal aid.  I am sure the Members will be  happy\r\n\r\nwith this enhanced limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other points made by Members, I will assure\r\n\r\nProf.  Chin  and Mr Kenneth Chen that Legal Aid  Bureau  will\r\n\r\nhave  the  capacity to handle the increased  workload,  about\r\n\r\n20%.   More staff will be engaged and, indeed, work processes\r\n\r\nwill be improved and manpower will be further trained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin asked whether Legal Aid can be more flexible in\r\n\r\nassessing  whether  or  not  aid  can  be  granted,  and   in\r\n\r\nparticular, he suggests that some form of subsidy be given to\r\n\r\nthose  who  do not qualify for aid.  Sir, Legal Aid  Bureau's\r\n\r\nmission  and purpose is to provide quality aid and advice  to\r\n\r\nthose  of limited means.  It does not cover the provision  of\r\n\r\nmonetary  subsidies.   However,  that  does  not  mean   that\r\n\r\neveryone who fails the means test will be left high and  dry.\r\n\r\nMost  of  those who fail the means test, indeed, now  receive\r\n\r\nlegal  advice on the law and procedure and available  courses\r\n\r\nof  action.  In any case, now with the high income limits,  I\r\n\r\nthink this would be less of a pressing problem.  Our approach\r\n\r\nhas worked well.  So I would tell Mr Sin, let us keep it like\r\n\r\nthis  for  the  moment,  and we can  review  the  means  test\r\n\r\nperiodically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go on to Mr Shanmugam's point. Mr Shanmugam\r\n\r\nsays that mandatory imprisonment to six months for harbourers\r\n\r\nfound guilty of harbouring immigration offenders is too harsh\r\n\r\nand  indefensible.  I strongly disagree.  The  punishment  is\r\n\r\nstrict,    but   under   today's   circumstances,    entirely\r\n\r\njustifiable.  I urge Mr Shanmugam and people of his like mind\r\n\r\nto look at the big picture.  The nature\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  magnitude  of our illegal offender problem  justifies  a\r\n\r\ntough  approach.   Last year, we arrested 16,500  immigration\r\n\r\noffenders  -  a large number by any account.  As reported  in\r\n\r\nthe  media - you read about it often - they are still  trying\r\n\r\nto  come in by all means.  An unchecked inflow of immigration\r\n\r\noffenders to a small island will cause grave social harm  and\r\n\r\npose immense security and safety risks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot lift the mandatory imprisonment\r\n\r\nrequirement  now.   Why?  Because it  would  send  the  wrong\r\n\r\nsignal  and it would put Singapore and Singaporeans at  risk.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we should stiffen our resolve to tackle the problem,\r\n\r\nand  that  is  being done not just by the Government,  but  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  also Singaporean employers and landlords  to  do\r\n\r\nlikewise.  So this is the larger context from which  we  must\r\n\r\nview  the strict punishment.  Larger countries in the  region\r\n\r\nface  immense problems caused by a large illegal  immigration\r\n\r\npopulation.  We must not let that happen to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam says that imposing mandatory imprisonment\r\n\r\non  harbourers  makes  a  serious  inroad  into  the  general\r\n\r\nprinciple  that  the  law should provide for  mandatory  jail\r\n\r\nsentences only in very exceptional situations.  This is  just\r\n\r\nsuch a situation - the serious problem that we face which  is\r\n\r\na  grave threat.  That will be very real if we do not keep up\r\n\r\nour efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act of renting out a room to one or even a few\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders in itself may seem innocuous.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot  a violent act.  No one is hurt.  That is a seductive but\r\n\r\nflawed  argument - because if many people do it,  the  safety\r\n\r\nand  well-being of Singaporeans, indeed the social  stability\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans, will be threatened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Mr Shanmugam and others like him that the\r\n\r\nGovernment invokes mandatory minimum sentences sparingly  and\r\n\r\nonly  after  very careful consideration, taking into  account\r\n\r\nnot only the nature of the offence but also the consequences,\r\n\r\nif the offending acts are left unchecked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should not let our resolve be shaken by\r\n\r\nmisplaced sympathy for the cases of convicted harbourers.  As\r\n\r\nMr  Shanmugam  well knows, as a lawyer, hard cases  make  bad\r\n\r\nlaw.   Should we change our approach because of these  cases?\r\n\r\nNo, we should not.  Mandatory imprisonment for harbourers has\r\n\r\nbeen  in  place since 1984.  Many harbourers had been  jailed\r\n\r\nbefore.  There was no public outcry.  This only started  with\r\n\r\nthe case of Mr Seow Boon Wah whose cause was picked up by the\r\n\r\nmedia.   The media focused on the fact that he was a  deacon.\r\n\r\nBy  profession, Mr Seow was in fact an insurance  agent.   Mr\r\n\r\nSeow's mitigation plea stated that he was an insurance agent,\r\n\r\nand I quote, \"He was an insurance agent until recently.\", and\r\n\r\n\"He is currently serving the church ministry full time on  an\r\n\r\nhonorary basis.\"  But the press reported him as a deacon  and\r\n\r\nthe public was seized with that image.  Surely, it cannot  be\r\n\r\nsuggested that deacons cannot break the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam also mentioned an old illiterate and poor\r\n\r\nlady  who did not know any better.  Well, Sir, many of  these\r\n\r\nelderly harbourers are not as innocent as they appear.  Quite\r\n\r\na  few have been warned before for letting out their premises\r\n\r\nto  immigration offenders.  But they persisted.   They  could\r\n\r\nhave  and  ought to have sought help, not least  from  family\r\n\r\nmembers, to conduct the checks.  But they did not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being lenient towards these elderly landlords will\r\n\r\nresult  in  them  being  used as a  front,  say,  by  illegal\r\n\r\nsyndicates to beat the law.  To bring home the point, let  me\r\n\r\nquote one example.  In a widely publicised case last year,  a\r\n\r\n73-year-old  lady was jailed for harbouring five  immigration\r\n\r\noffenders.   She did not check the passports or work  passes.\r\n\r\nShe was previously warned for harbouring four PRC immigration\r\n\r\noffenders,   just  10  months  earlier.   The   warning   was\r\n\r\nadministered  in  the  presence of her  two  daughters.   She\r\n\r\nobviously  did not learn her lesson.  Some thought  that  the\r\n\r\nlaw  was too harsh on her.  But, in reality, she was a  smart\r\n\r\nand  scheming lady and knew what she was doing.  She was even\r\n\r\nsmart enough to take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHDB  for a ride.  She had been allocated a 1-room rental flat\r\n\r\nby HDB in 1991.  In June 1994, she bought a private  property\r\n\r\ntogether with her daughter.  This was not known to HDB  until\r\n\r\na  year  later in 1995, when she was served a notice to  quit\r\n\r\nthe  HDB flat.  She appealed successfully through her MP  for\r\n\r\nher  to be allowed to rent the flat on the condition that she\r\n\r\nwould  relinquish  her  share of  ownership  of  the  private\r\n\r\nproperty.    However,  investigations   revealed   that   her\r\n\r\nrelinquishment of ownership was only on paper.  The  transfer\r\n\r\ndocument  clearly  indicated that she was  to  be  given  all\r\n\r\nrights  to continue staying in the private property and  that\r\n\r\nher  daughter would have no right to dispose of the  property\r\n\r\nwithout  her  prior consent.  Further, she  would  bear  full\r\n\r\nresponsibility  during her occupation of the  unit.   Is  she\r\n\r\ntherefore  really an \"old, illiterate and poor lady  who  did\r\n\r\nnot know any better\", as Mr Shanmugam puts it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cited these cases at some length to highlight the\r\n\r\ndanger of typecasting harbourers as \"the poor deacon\" or \"the\r\n\r\nold   and   illiterate  poor  lady\".   These  are   appealing\r\n\r\ncaricatures which normally do not tell the full story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam is right in that landlords who have been\r\n\r\nconvicted  come from diverse backgrounds.  Nevertheless,  all\r\n\r\nof  them,  by  their  act  of renting  out  the  premises  to\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders,  have  contributed  to  the   serious\r\n\r\nproblem  today.   Their diverse backgrounds  notwithstanding,\r\n\r\nthere is a common thread linking them.  They have rented  out\r\n\r\ntheir  flat and that have enabled some illegal immigrants  to\r\n\r\nstay.  Their liability under the Immigration Act must be seen\r\n\r\nin  this context, which is the requirement set out clearly in\r\n\r\nthe  Immigration Act for landlords to make some basic  checks\r\n\r\nwhen they rent out their premises.  These are termed the \"due\r\n\r\ndiligence requirements\" in the Act.  These requirements  have\r\n\r\nbeen  widely publicised.  No one should claim he is not aware\r\n\r\nof  them.  Indeed, these commonsense checks are not difficult\r\n\r\nto  fulfill.   Landlords  know that  they  are  dealing  with\r\n\r\nforeign  tenants.   Yet, many do not bother  to  check  their\r\n\r\ntenants' passports, despite the widespread and regular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublicity  over  the  years about the  immigration  offenders\r\n\r\nproblem.   Some merely look at photocopies of their  tenants'\r\n\r\nwork  permits; others just leave the checking to the  housing\r\n\r\nagents.  That is why offenders mentioned by Mr Shanmugam  are\r\n\r\nconvicted and jailed.  That is not good enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative development of the Immigration Act makes\r\n\r\nclear  that the introduction of due diligence checks in  1993\r\n\r\nwas  to  prevent landlords from escaping liability by  merely\r\n\r\narguing that they had checked some documents proffered by the\r\n\r\ntenants.   In  other words, to make clear  that  careless  or\r\n\r\nnegligent checking would not do.  In 1991, Justice F A  Chua,\r\n\r\nin relation to a harbouring case, said that the social policy\r\n\r\nof  the  Act,  and  I quote, \"would not be achieved  if  mere\r\n\r\nnegligence  and  recklessness on the part of the  accused  to\r\n\r\nenquire  about  the  status  of  the  illegal  immigrant   or\r\n\r\noverstayer,  if he knows or has reasons to believe  that  the\r\n\r\nperson  is  a  foreigner, would be sufficient  to  rebut  the\r\n\r\npresumption of knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Justice in a later case on appeal (1993) said\r\n\r\nthat, and I quote, \"to allow an employer to evade the section\r\n\r\nby  shutting his eyes to the immigration or employment status\r\n\r\nof   his  foreign  employee  will  make  proper  control  and\r\n\r\nenforcement impossible.  It cannot be placing too  onerous  a\r\n\r\nduty  upon  employers in Singapore to require them to  screen\r\n\r\ntheir   foreign  workers  before  employing  them  to  ensure\r\n\r\ncompliance with immigration policy and law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, from the outset, both the courts and Government\r\n\r\nwere  in  agreement that our immigration  laws  must  not  be\r\n\r\ndefeated  by  a harbourer or employer simply making  a  claim\r\n\r\nthat  he  did  not know that the tenant, the worker,  was  an\r\n\r\nimmigration offender.  The judges agreed that our immigration\r\n\r\nlaws  should be interpreted strictly; in other words,  it  is\r\n\r\nreasonable  to  impose some form of screening  or  checks  by\r\n\r\nlandlords and employers.  Being careless and negligent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  conducting the checks was just not good enough.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Justice, in another case said, \"Social and  public\r\n\r\npolicy dictates that the law relating to immigration offences\r\n\r\nis  deliberately  strict.  Those who come into  contact  with\r\n\r\nforeign workers are required to learn one way or another what\r\n\r\nthey must do and what they need not do in their dealings with\r\n\r\nforeign workers.\"  The same can be said of landlords who deal\r\n\r\nwith  tenants  who are immigration offenders.   Hence,  being\r\n\r\ncareless or negligent is not good enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

We are no  longer  the\r\n\r\ncultural  desert  that  we were in  the  70s  and  80s.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  done much to facilitate and  assist  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the arts.  Funding for the arts has  increased\r\n\r\nmanifold in the last ten years.  Busking is now legal.  There\r\n\r\nis also an increased outreach programme in schools, parks and\r\n\r\ncommunities.   Funding  for  the  arts  education  has   also\r\n\r\nincreased  in recent years.  Some arts groups are now  housed\r\n\r\nin  permanent  locations  and are  partially  funded  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen  there is also the Annual Arts Festival and Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntoday   are   able   to  enjoy  the  benefits   of   numerous\r\n\r\ninternational shows in a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also building the $600 million arts\r\n\r\ncentre  called The Esplanade - Theatre at the Bay which  will\r\n\r\nbe  ready in the second half of next year.  Sir, credit  must\r\n\r\ngo  to  the  National Arts Council  and the various  agencies\r\n\r\nunder   MITA   for   promoting  and   developing   the   arts\r\n\r\nsuccessfully.  Perhaps, it is time to take stock of what  had\r\n\r\nbeen  achieved in the past decade of the development  of  the\r\n\r\narts.  I would therefore like to ask the Minister if he would\r\n\r\nupdate  the  House  on  his  Ministry's  mission  to  develop\r\n\r\nSingapore as a Renaissance City and where do we proceed  from\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the same cut, I have a specific question to ask\r\n\r\nand  that pertains to the criteria for state fundings of  the\r\n\r\narts.  I am concerned that, in our haste to promote the  arts\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, we may have inadvertently forgotten  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  we live in a multi-racial, multi-religious society with\r\n\r\nstrong  moral and ethical standards.  Of late,  a  number  of\r\n\r\nproductions  by artistes, both local and foreign,  have  been\r\n\r\nstaged  in  Singapore to public audience which have  included\r\n\r\nrather controversial and sensitive topics.  Take the case  of\r\n\r\nTalaq   which  covers  one  Indian-Muslim  story  of  marital\r\n\r\nviolence  and  rape.  Then there is Rent,  a  rock  'n'  roll\r\n\r\nmusical  that  included positive treatments of  homosexuality\r\n\r\nand drug abuse.  And there are others like Asian Boys Vol. 1,\r\n\r\nthe S and M Musical \"Chameleon\", and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not averse to letting artistes expressing\r\n\r\nthemselves.   However,  left to their  own  decisions,  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  that  art  for arts' sake can include  just  about\r\n\r\nanything  that  may not be in the interest of our  community.\r\n\r\nIt  is  therefore necessary to ensure that state funding  for\r\n\r\nthe  arts, whether through the NAC or other agencies,  should\r\n\r\nbe a lot more selective with some definable criteria.  Whilst\r\n\r\nwe  would  like  to support creativity and  develop  our  own\r\n\r\ncritical  mass of local artistes, we may have to  be  careful\r\n\r\nwhen public funds are poured into productions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  have themes that are anathema to the wider interest  of\r\n\r\nour  society.

In addition, perhaps,  MITA\r\n\r\ncould  come  out  with a code of practice  binding  corporate\r\n\r\nsponsors for the arts as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to inform hon.

Sir, the NAC has a great challenge\r\n\r\nahead   of  it.   Let  me  start  by  saying  that  from   my\r\n\r\nconversations  with various arts groups and practitioners,  I\r\n\r\nhave   heard   much   positive  comments  about   the   NAC's\r\n\r\naccessibility, about its efforts to establish and maintain  a\r\n\r\ngood  dialogue with the arts community and its responsiveness\r\n\r\nto  suggestions  and  recommendations made  about  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes  and  training grants that would be most helpful  and\r\n\r\nsupportive.  Building depth in industry is not something that\r\n\r\ncan be achieved overnight.  And currently, it is difficult to\r\n\r\nfind enough good and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexperienced  people  from players to technicians,  production\r\n\r\nmanagers,  all categories of people, for all the  events  and\r\n\r\nactivities that are now being organised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying problem is the inability to pay enough to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  good solid core of full-time professionals  in  the\r\n\r\narts  industry.  It seems that, apart from a  few  in  senior\r\n\r\npositions in the big very well established groups, either you\r\n\r\nneed  to  have very supportive and understanding parents  who\r\n\r\nwill  allow  you to live with them, probably well  into  your\r\n\r\ngeriatric years, or you have still to be working part time in\r\n\r\nthe  arts  and  sustain  yourself in another  day  time  job.\r\n\r\nBecause, historically, the arts group has been functioning in\r\n\r\nthis manner.  From our days of a completely amateur community\r\n\r\nin  the  arts,  the operating budget all this time  has  been\r\n\r\nbuilt  on a base of token salaries and allowances.  They  are\r\n\r\ncaught  now  in  a bind.  How can you justify  quantum  leaps\r\n\r\npercentage-wise  in  your  manpower  costs  in   putting   up\r\n\r\nprogrammes?   The  groups  are  very  appreciative   of   the\r\n\r\nadditional funding they have been getting lately.   But  much\r\n\r\nof  it  is  going to more programmes and activities and  very\r\n\r\nlittle to adjusting salaries and allowances to anything  even\r\n\r\nclose to what would be needed in the longer term to make  any\r\n\r\ndifference  in  growing a core of full-time professionals  in\r\n\r\nthe arts, which is what you are going to need if you want  to\r\n\r\nbuild that group in the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, and from the perspective of supporting\r\n\r\nmost  wholeheartedly what NAC is seeking to achieve,  I  must\r\n\r\nsay  that  it must be a very tough task to develop  a  global\r\n\r\ncity  in the arts with an annual budget of $32 million  which\r\n\r\nis what the NAC has for FY 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also notice that the projected increase in next year's\r\n\r\nbudget  is  only about $3 million in operating budget.   When\r\n\r\nyou look at the $50 million over five years that has been set\r\n\r\naside for the Renaissance City initiatives, this seems rather\r\n\r\nless than what one would expect.  Possibly, the NAC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  being  prudent and saving more to be spent in  the  later\r\n\r\npart  of the five years.  But I would encourage it to be more\r\n\r\naggressive and pump in the resources early, to jump-start the\r\n\r\neffort  so  that we can get to the critical mass of  industry\r\n\r\nplayers and participants to really make the difference.   And\r\n\r\nto  support and, in fact, encourage arts groups in its review\r\n\r\nand  approval  of  grants,  that they  should  factor  in  in\r\n\r\nincreasing  the amounts needed to start moving  artistes  and\r\n\r\narts  professionals'  remuneration towards  levels  that  are\r\n\r\nnecessary to make careers in the arts more viable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I also pick up on Mr Chew's point on concern about\r\n\r\nregulation  in  the  view  of  the  more  liberal  and   some\r\n\r\ncontroversial  and  possibly provocative programmes  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  seeing lately?  I do understand that,  given  our\r\n\r\nvery  varied and diverse community, this would be a  concern.\r\n\r\nI  know that currently, there is a review going on as to  how\r\n\r\nthe  arts  should be licensed and regulated.  I  would  argue\r\n\r\nvery  strongly to keep in fact the regulating  body  and  the\r\n\r\nfunding body separate because, otherwise, it is going  to  be\r\n\r\nextremely difficult.  You are going to get tied up  in  knots\r\n\r\nas  to what you should be funding, as an agency promoting the\r\n\r\narts,  and  what you need to be taking care of, in  terms  of\r\n\r\nsensitivity to our communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the Government has\r\n\r\nincreased funding for the arts.  This is a very positive step\r\n\r\nforward  for  the arts scene in Singapore.  At present,  four\r\n\r\nestablished groups receive $2 million each, 17 smaller groups\r\n\r\nshare  another  $2  million, with the  remaining  $2  million\r\n\r\nshared  by  another 60-odd groups.  However,  community-based\r\n\r\nand  clan association-based groups are not eligible for funds\r\n\r\nfrom this scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation in funding does not acknowledge the\r\n\r\nimportant  role the small groups play in forging cohesiveness\r\n\r\nas  well  as  in  promoting  understanding  among  groups  of\r\n\r\ndifferent cultural backgrounds.  With a very small population\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, it is very difficult for performing groups  to\r\n\r\nsolely rely on its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nown  community  to survive, not to say flourish.   Without  a\r\n\r\nvibrant  arts  scene  at the grassroots level,  it  would  be\r\n\r\ndifficult for Singapore to cultivate arts as an integral part\r\n\r\nof every Singaporean's life, the foundation for a Renaissance\r\n\r\nCity.   However, we have been very fortunate to have a  group\r\n\r\nof   successful  Singaporeans  who  are  also   strong   arts\r\n\r\nsupporters.   It  is this group of arts supporters  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  contributing to the small groups.  And each  year,  the\r\n\r\nNational Arts Council confers its prestigious Patron  of  the\r\n\r\nArts Awards, Friends of the Arts Awards and Associate of  the\r\n\r\nArts  Awards to those who contribute $50,000 and  more.   The\r\n\r\nsupporters of the small groups have been neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the NAC launched the New Arts\r\n\r\nSupporters  Award  this  year  to  recognise  this  group  of\r\n\r\nsponsors  who have contributed less than $50,000 towards  the\r\n\r\npromotion  and organisation of the artistic activities.   The\r\n\r\ncontribution of this group of small time supporters  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen recognised for a long, long time.  However, it is better\r\n\r\nlate than never.  I would like to urge MITA to also award the\r\n\r\nOutstanding  Small  Performing Arts  Group,  based  on  their\r\n\r\nperformance and potential.  The award can be in the  form  of\r\n\r\ncash  grant, plus training opportunity.  At present, most  of\r\n\r\nthe  arts  groups survive on a very lean budget.   Funds  and\r\n\r\nopportunities for training should be extended  to  the  small\r\n\r\narts groups, especially in the area of arts management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

In fact, on some days, Singaporeans have  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  time choosing what art events to attend.   I  must\r\n\r\ncongratulate MITA, in particular, the National Arts  Council,\r\n\r\nfor   implementing  many  of  the  public   suggestions   and\r\n\r\nrecommendations contained in the Renaissance City plan.  I am\r\n\r\nparticularly glad that NAC has started using the $50  million\r\n\r\nGovernment  fund to fund various performing  arts  groups  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  With all these efforts and the completion of  The\r\n\r\nEsplanade  -  Theatre at the Bay in 2002,  we  can  certainly\r\n\r\nproclaim ourselves as a global city for the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to give us an update on\r\n\r\nthe    progress   made   on   the   implementation   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations contained in the Renaissance  City  plan  and\r\n\r\nthe future plans of the Ministry to bring arts to the people,\r\n\r\nparticularly to those in the HDB heartland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the concerns that has been raised by those\r\n\r\nin  the  arts  arena is to have greater transparency  in  the\r\n\r\ngrant  of  funds by the NAC, for arts groups.  I  have  often\r\n\r\nheard  complaints of certain arts groups being favoured  over\r\n\r\nothers.   I  would like to ask the Minister  to  explain  the\r\n\r\nprocess of how NAC considers grants, and how far the NAC  can\r\n\r\ngo,  to make the process a transparent one so that the public\r\n\r\ncan see for themselves how the funds are disbursed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point that I would like to raise is that\r\n\r\none  of  the yardsticks for success as an artiste is to  gain\r\n\r\ninternational recognition.  I am sure that we have many local\r\n\r\nartistes who are well known internationally.  There are  many\r\n\r\nmore  local artistes who will need international exposure  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  their  learning  through  exchange  programmes  and\r\n\r\noverseas  performances.  I would like to ask the Minister  as\r\n\r\nto  the measures that have been taken by MITA to provide  the\r\n\r\nnecessary international exposure to these young budding local\r\n\r\nartistes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, there has already been some\r\n\r\ndebate  on  this  subject  of media liberalisation  recently.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  would like to reinforce the concern  that  media\r\n\r\nliberalisation, which has thus far involved the proliferation\r\n\r\nof  a great number of newspapers generally reporting the same\r\n\r\nnews, may lead, if we are not careful, to a deterioration  in\r\n\r\nquality   standards  of  newspapers,  in  order  to   attract\r\n\r\nattention and ensure circulation volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public now has a wide variety of newspapers to\r\n\r\nchoose from.  These include our traditional Straits Times and\r\n\r\nthe  mass  circulation  New Paper,  Streats,  Today,  Project\r\n\r\nEyeball.  In order to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompete  for readership and, hence, advertising revenue,  our\r\n\r\npress has occasionally resorted to sensationalisation at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  providing  pertinent and  reliable  information.\r\n\r\nSir, it is not just Project Eyeball or Streats which displays\r\n\r\ncentrespreads of a scantily-clad Jennifer Lopez, for example.\r\n\r\nEven the venerable Straits Times has not been spared the need\r\n\r\nto  highlight sex and violence occasionally.  Take the Sunday\r\n\r\nTimes  of  25th February 2001, for example, where  the  story\r\n\r\nabout a couple making love on board a British Airways flight,\r\n\r\ncovered  a significant part of the front page of that  paper.\r\n\r\nNews  on  ministerial walkabouts or national  policy  news  - which  certainly cannot compete as juicy news - do not always\r\n\r\nsteal a front page story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the local print media is still protected by\r\n\r\nlegislation  from foreign competition.  It has  therefore  an\r\n\r\nobligation  to  continue  to support the  national  interest,\r\n\r\nwhich  is to raise the awareness of domestic and other issues\r\n\r\nwhich  are critical to nation-building.  We cannot afford  to\r\n\r\nhave this role negated completely for commercial interest as,\r\n\r\nonce  we  start on that slippery slope downhill, it  will  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  crawl back to higher standards of journalistic\r\n\r\nintegrity, which our media should aspire to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to propose to the Minister that\r\n\r\nthe  Publication  Advisory Committee (PAC) of  MITA  step  up\r\n\r\nefforts  and  take  on a more pro-active  role  in  reviewing\r\n\r\njournalism  and editorial standards of our newspapers.   Like\r\n\r\nthe  other  two  more  active programme  advisory  committees\r\n\r\noverseeing programming and development in the other two media\r\n\r\n-  the broadcast and Internet - I propose that the PAC should\r\n\r\nreport to the Minister regularly as a check against any  drop\r\n\r\nin standards of reporting by our local newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, last year, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  liberalised  the media.   There  are  three  more\r\n\r\nnewspapers now.  Singaporeans are aware of the keen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompetition in print media and they know that it is better to\r\n\r\nhave  competition because they can get free  newspapers.   On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, in order to stimulate their sales volume, the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  have resorted to feature all kinds of sensational\r\n\r\nnews.  But it is too early to conclude whether the additional\r\n\r\nnewspapers are good or bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broadcasting and TV stations will also be plunged\r\n\r\ninto  competition.  We have to make use of SCV to serve every\r\n\r\nhome  in  Singapore as well as homes outside Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nMinister,  in answer to questions about the media,  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  the opening up of the newspapers and the press is good,\r\n\r\nalthough  there  are  some  newspapers  which  feature   some\r\n\r\nscantily-dressed ladies on their front-page  to  attract  the\r\n\r\nreaders.    Will  MITA review the guidelines  on  the  media?\r\n\r\nWhether  they are in English, Chinese, Malay or Tamil,  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  some  fair  guiding principles  so  that  our  TV\r\n\r\nstations will not lower their standards and resort to sex and\r\n\r\nviolence  in  order  to  get  more  viewers.   What  kind  of\r\n\r\nassistance will be given to our local stations to  cope  with\r\n\r\nthe  competition by the foreign stations?  We cannot deny the\r\n\r\nfact  that many Singaporeans have started to switch  over  to\r\n\r\nforeign stations as they find foreign TV programmes of a very\r\n\r\nhigh   standard,  in  terms  of  programming,   content   and\r\n\r\npackaging, etc.  Therefore, we have to catch up with foreign-made  programmes.  It is possible that after watching foreign\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for  some time they may not switch  back  to  our\r\n\r\nlocal  stations and be oblivious of what has been   happening\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am\r\n\r\na   bit   more  optimistic  about  the  experiment  on  media\r\n\r\nliberalisation so far, compared to the previous speakers, and\r\n\r\nrise  to  urge  the  Minister  to  allow  and  consider  some\r\n\r\nregulation  of  the  media to keep  pace  with  the  expected\r\n\r\nfurther liberalisation down the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at a recent meeting of the feedback group on mass\r\n\r\nmedia,   participants   expressed   the   view   that   media\r\n\r\nliberalisation has brought about greater choices\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   variety   of   news  reporting,  with  newspapers   and\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  stations targeting on specific  niche  markets.\r\n\r\nThis  is very good because readers can now choose the  papers\r\n\r\nand  TV  channels that would best cater to their  own  needs.\r\n\r\nAnd, fortunately, despite the competition and availability of\r\n\r\nfree  newspapers,  we  have so far  escaped  the  much-feared\r\n\r\nnegative  impact  that media liberalisation could  bring,  as\r\n\r\nexperienced in some countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newspapers, in general, have not been tempted or\r\n\r\ndistracted to sell sex, sleaze and crime as a means to  boost\r\n\r\ncirculation,  but there is one qualifier.  This afternoon,  I\r\n\r\nam  tempted  to  change  my mind after  Prof.  Toh  See  Kiat\r\n\r\ndistracted  my  attention and showed  me  the  centrefold  of\r\n\r\ntoday's Today newspaper.  A large part of the success, except\r\n\r\nfor  this  exception, is primarily due to the restriction  on\r\n\r\nownership  of  the media that still remains in the  hands  of\r\n\r\ntrusted  Singapore Government-owned companies, which  carries\r\n\r\nwith  it special voting rights. Generally the press has  been\r\n\r\nresponsible  in  balancing its rights  and  responsibilities,\r\n\r\ntrusted  for  its  role in public service, and  impartial  in\r\n\r\nbalancing  reports and views - sometimes,  I  notice,  taking\r\n\r\npains to separate information from opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I find it very ironic that while the local\r\n\r\nmedia  is  trusted  to serve the general good  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nprotecting  our culture and religious values, and  recognised\r\n\r\nas  important partners in nation building, yet it is not good\r\n\r\nenough to regulate or self-regulate or look after some of its\r\n\r\ninternal interests.  My own view is that the press has earned\r\n\r\nthe   public  trust  to  be  self-regulated,  and  we  should\r\n\r\nencourage this, at least for two very important reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Further liberalisation can be expected. New\r\n\r\ntechnologies will mean greater availability and accessibility\r\n\r\nof  all  kinds of news media being delivered right  into  our\r\n\r\nhomes.   We  must, therefore, start paving the  way  for  the\r\n\r\nmedia   themselves  to  establish  some  of  the  rules   and\r\n\r\nregulations  in which they operate.  It would be increasingly\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  the Government to continue  to  regulate  the\r\n\r\nmedia in its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting   form  in  the  face  of  new  and  ever-increasing\r\n\r\ninformation  channels brought about by new  technologies.   A\r\n\r\nresponsible media is ultimately better placed to decide  what\r\n\r\nis  desirable and what is not.  If we can achieve this,  just\r\n\r\nlike some of the regulations on Internet, then regulations on\r\n\r\nour media can be administered with a lighter touch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We still need to do a lot more to overcome the\r\n\r\nunfortunate  negative perceptions associated with  the  local\r\n\r\nmedia  implied by the statutory regulations - that of  heavy-handed  control  of  censorship,  or  the  encouragement   of\r\n\r\ncensorship,  and  the fear that the very organisations  which\r\n\r\nare  more often the subject of hard news, ie, Government  and\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  are judging the rules on how  they  should  be\r\n\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that a Press Commission be set up with members\r\n\r\nfrom  the  media representatives and lay persons,  and  given\r\n\r\npowers  to  take complaints from the public and to judge  the\r\n\r\nbehaviour  of  its  members according to an  agreed  code  of\r\n\r\npractice.  If need be, this autonomous body can still  report\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister.  The Commission can, for  example,  settle\r\n\r\ndisputes on unethical practices and unfair behaviour  by  the\r\n\r\nmedia.   For example, the recent revelation of the  financial\r\n\r\ncircumstance  of  a  TCS actress raised in  some  people  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate fears of media intrusion into what should  be  the\r\n\r\nprivate  lives of individuals, especially of persons who  are\r\n\r\nneither officials nor public figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it could pave the way for further\r\n\r\nliberalisation,  if  the system proves  media  capability  to\r\n\r\nsustain responsible and ethical behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there are adequate laws and provisions that\r\n\r\ncurrently exist to ensure that self-regulation will not  lead\r\n\r\nto  a free-for-all situation or an adversarial or ideological\r\n\r\npartisan media environment.  I, for one, would agree that the\r\n\r\nexisting  defamation laws, for example, must remain in  force\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the media continue to strike the appropriate\r\n\r\nbalance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween   the  protection  of  regulation  and   freedom   of\r\n\r\nexpression.   But I am hoping that the Minister  acknowledges\r\n\r\nthat in the long-run, self-regulation is a necessary step  in\r\n\r\nthe on-going process of media liberalisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Thank you, Sir, for letting\r\n\r\nme join in the debate, and thank you, Encik Zulkifli, for the\r\n\r\nteaser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a liberal age and our various monopolistic\r\n\r\nand   cartelistic   businesses  are   being   introduced   to\r\n\r\ncompetition.  Telecommunications, power generation, you  have\r\n\r\nit.  and,  now,  television  and  newspapers.   We  are  also\r\n\r\nbecoming very liberal in our values.  But I jump ahead of  my\r\n\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, I sat down to watch a television\r\n\r\nprogramme which my newspaper TV schedule proclaimed to  be  a\r\n\r\ndocumentary.   It was called \"The Making of  Perfection\".   I\r\n\r\nshould  have  known better, as that title was the advertising\r\n\r\nslogan  of  a  luxury brand of cars.  It was  15  minutes  of\r\n\r\nshameless  self-praise.   For such a  programme  in  America,\r\n\r\nthere  are  laws requiring the insertion of a footer  on  the\r\n\r\nscreen stating that it is a paid commercial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, sometimes we make mistakes, errors of judgement\r\n\r\nand,  in  that  case, the TV station admitted  it  was  their\r\n\r\nfault,  and  apologised  for  the  wrong  labelling  of   the\r\n\r\nprogramme.   Still, a legally-mandated footer on  screen  for\r\n\r\nsuch  programmes,  as also for TV shopping programmes,  would\r\n\r\nhave been proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some days ago, I saw the gory picture of a girl with 70%\r\n\r\nburns,   in  full  colour,  on  the  front  of  two   evening\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  No surprise to many of us, I suppose.  But  that\r\n\r\npicture  appeared too in the English tabloids and  -  take  a\r\n\r\ndeep  breath - in full colour, on the front page,  of  a  so-called  \"quality, family newspaper\" (but greatly  reduced  in\r\n\r\nsize, as if that reduces the offence).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newspapers, magazines, television programmes, radio\r\n\r\nprogrammes - no one is apologetic these days that there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  increasing  supply  of  sex, blood,  scanty  clothes  and\r\n\r\nprurient  \"news stories\" - the kind where sexual  organs  are\r\n\r\ncut  by  furious wives, sexual offenders whose  offences  are\r\n\r\ndescribed in graphic detail, transsexuals who play volleyball\r\n\r\n-  you  name it, they have it.  And, in case you want  me  to\r\n\r\ngive  you  an  example,  this is what Mr  Zulkifli  mentioned\r\n\r\n[indicating] - on the pretext of reporting the decline in the\r\n\r\nmorals  of  fashion  shows  - full  colour,  scantily-clothed\r\n\r\nladies.  Sir, would you like a closer look?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrepentant radio programmers even urge critics to\r\n\r\nswitch  off  the  radio if they do not like  the  programmes.\r\n\r\nThat,  to  me, Sir, is akin to saying, \"Let us allow  Playboy\r\n\r\nmagazine to come in and, if any one objects to it, don't  buy\r\n\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times, Today, Streats, Wanbao - what have\r\n\r\nyou  -  they have all cut close to the fringes of bad  taste,\r\n\r\nmurky  morals  and dodgy ethics.  Advertisements masquerading\r\n\r\nas  staff-written feature articles.  Here is another example.\r\n\r\nToday's Today, page 34, a full-page feature on the glories of\r\n\r\nDubai  and  a  full page advertisement, next page,  on  Dubai\r\n\r\nitself.   Coincidental?  Not related at all?  Tell me another\r\n\r\none.   Sir,  what  is wrong with journalists  praising  their\r\n\r\nadvertisers?   Well,  for one, deception,  or,  at  the  very\r\n\r\nleast,  breach of trust.  Journalists are supposed  to  write\r\n\r\ninvestigative pieces from an unbiased angle, uninfluenced  by\r\n\r\nmonetary  inducements.  Their views  are  trusted.    Another\r\n\r\nproblem,  and I think opposition politicians think they  face\r\n\r\nthis alone, is refusal to print corrections to errors in news\r\n\r\nstories, or printing corrections in obscure inside pages when\r\n\r\nthe  erroneous news story appears in banner headlines on  the\r\n\r\nfront page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember once when I was CASE President, a certain\r\n\r\nnewspaper  published a series of articles laden with  errors.\r\n\r\nAnother  time, they had a sensational front page  story  that\r\n\r\nwas  based on misinterpretation of what I said, and  this  is\r\n\r\nbefore liberalisation.  Both times, I asked for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nright  to reply.  Instead, the Editor negotiated with me  for\r\n\r\nan  apology.   I  had  to  give  in.   Why?   Well,  as  CASE\r\n\r\nPresident,  I  needed to be in their good  books.   They  can\r\n\r\nlionise you, even give you credit for things you did not  do,\r\n\r\nor they can shut you out.  As CASE President, I really needed\r\n\r\ntheir support for my cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there is the question of deception and\r\n\r\nmisrepresentation  to  obtain news  stories.   Recently,  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times ran stories on the MPs of 1997 who are rising,\r\n\r\nor  who are grassroots MPs.  I thank them for listing  me  as\r\n\r\none  of  the  five  grassroots  MPs.  But  I  agree  with  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, that public speeches are no way\r\n\r\nto  measure  our work as MPs. What I am more concerned  about\r\n\r\ntoday,  however,  is  that  they  got  me  to  send  them  my\r\n\r\ncurriculum  vitae with this letter:  \"Dear Sir,  we  need  to\r\n\r\nupdate our database to ensure it is accurate\"  and not  \"Dear\r\n\r\nSir, we want your updated CV because we want to write a story\r\n\r\nabout  you after comparing your CV with other MPs' CVs.\"   If\r\n\r\nthey did that, they would not have got their story.  Who  can\r\n\r\nI  complain to to stop what I see as the first step down  the\r\n\r\nslippery  slope  to  yellow journalism?  There  should  be  a\r\n\r\nneutral, independent watchdog body for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for advertising ethics, that is supposedly covered by\r\n\r\na   self-regulatory  scheme  called  the  Singapore  Code  of\r\n\r\nAdvertising Practice (SCAP).  That document was last  drafted\r\n\r\nin  1976  and hopelessly out of tune with the times.   It  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  code imposed only on members.  The new media owners,\r\n\r\nthe  electronic  publishers, the print publications  and  the\r\n\r\nbroadcasters  - they are all out of reach because  they  have\r\n\r\nnot  joined as members.   Besides, the code has no teeth  and\r\n\r\nworks  as  long as the media owners cooperate.  In  1997,  as\r\n\r\nCASE  President,  I presented a proposed  new  SCAP  for  the\r\n\r\nindustry   body,  the  Advertising  Standards  Authority   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   to   consider.   They   are   reportedly   still\r\n\r\nconsidering.   There  is  no will to  change  and  unlike  Mr\r\n\r\nZulkilfi,  I have a dimmer view of media self-regulation.   I\r\n\r\nthink there should be, at the very least, co-regulation  with\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As moral standards slide, the regulators are standing by\r\n\r\ninert.  The  sins  are  not serious  enough  yet.   And  that\r\n\r\nconvenient cop-out:  we already have this and that and  other\r\n\r\ncommittee.  In any case, in the age of converging  media,  we\r\n\r\ncan  no  longer  have different agencies governing  different\r\n\r\ncategories  of  media. This agency for print, that  authority\r\n\r\nfor broadcasting, that board for films, etc, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed time for a Media Watch Council (MWC) with\r\n\r\npowers to impose penalties on infringements of morals, ethics\r\n\r\nor  bad  taste,  regardless  of the  medium.   Merely  making\r\n\r\nrecommendations  for  future  change,  such   as   what   the\r\n\r\nPublications  Advisory Committee and other advisory  councils\r\n\r\ncurrently  do,  is  a  mockery.   No  one  takes  note.   The\r\n\r\npenalties  imposed  by  the MWC can  range  from  censure  to\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of  the  programme  or,  perhaps  funding   where\r\n\r\nrelevant,   or   cancellation   of   the   advertisement   or\r\n\r\nmodification and amendment.  The MWC should also  have  power\r\n\r\nto  order corrections to be made with the same prominence and\r\n\r\nin  the  same space as the original error-ridden publication,\r\n\r\nand the power to fine those whose infractions are already too\r\n\r\nlate  to  remedy  or too serious to ignore. The  MWC  can  be\r\n\r\ncomposed  of a mix of lay persons and the pillars of society,\r\n\r\nas  is  presently the case in the various advisory committees\r\n\r\nof  MITA.   In  this  way, we can allow  for  some  room  for\r\n\r\nchanging value systems in the society at large.  I am mindful\r\n\r\nof  the  fact that some people say we used not to be able  to\r\n\r\nlook at ankles of ladies, now we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, without such a Council, it is every man and media\r\n\r\nowner  for himself/itself.  It is not a pretty situation.  If\r\n\r\nwe  do not act now, we will slowly but surely acclimatise  to\r\n\r\nthe  lower  standards.  Like the frog in the  slowly  boiling\r\n\r\nwater,  we  would be dead before we even realise  we  are  in\r\n\r\ndanger. That cannot be what the silent majority wants.   That\r\n\r\ncannot be what the Government wants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to act now, as preventive\r\n\r\nmedication is always better\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand cheaper than curative medication and treatments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I will be less emotional. I\r\n\r\nmake  this  cut  to  express my concern over  the  increasing\r\n\r\nproliferation  of  violence in our various  mass  media.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  a widely accessible TV programming,  Sportscity\r\n\r\nshows  the  World Wrestling Federation (WWF) at 10.30  pm  on\r\n\r\nFridays,  6.00  pm on Saturdays and 5.00 pm on  Sundays,  and\r\n\r\nthese  are  all prime hours.  The recent WWF programme  shows\r\n\r\nthat  wrestling can also be a bloody experience.  A programme\r\n\r\nthat  glorifies violence has now been telecast  as  wholesome\r\n\r\nfamily entertainment.  It has been reported that children  in\r\n\r\nschools,  who are not properly supervised, try to  mimic  the\r\n\r\nacts  of  these wrestlers.  I am not alone here.   In  recent\r\n\r\ntimes,  letters that appear in the Forum Page of the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes have also expressed the same concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the SCV cartoon channel has deteriorated to include\r\n\r\nscenes of gratuitous violence.  One particular culprit is the\r\n\r\n\"cow and the chicken\" cartoon series which is screened almost\r\n\r\nat  all  times of the day.  I am concerned that it  does  not\r\n\r\njust  stop there. This is but a couple of examples on society\r\n\r\nthat  is  now  flushed  with violent images  and  programmes.\r\n\r\nWhilst  we  have been focusing on sex on the big screen,  and\r\n\r\nR(A)  ratings  are routinely given for films and  productions\r\n\r\nwhich  have a sexual content that is beyond a certain  level,\r\n\r\nthe  level  of general violence in non R(A)-rated  films  may\r\n\r\nhave  gone unnoticed.  Glorification in the press for  movies\r\n\r\nlike  Hannibal,  for example, and the print  media  focus  on\r\n\r\nphotographs,  like  what  the  earlier  speakers  have  said,\r\n\r\ndepicting violence on the front pages to catch attentions  of\r\n\r\nreaders, is also disturbing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the studies on the influence of TV and film and\r\n\r\ncartoon  violence  in US and Japan have not been  conclusive,\r\n\r\nthere  are  parallels that can be drawn between the  horrific\r\n\r\nviolent crimes in Japan and the United States and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nambivalence of its youth to it.  Even the subject of violence\r\n\r\ndid  not  escape  the  eyes  of the MITA  Programme  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee on TV and radio programmes.  In its recent  report,\r\n\r\nit  has  highlighted  that  programmes  with  strong  violent\r\n\r\nthemes,  like  WWF, should be avoided during  family  viewing\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is timely to review our censorship\r\n\r\npolicy  on violence in general in our various media.   May  I\r\n\r\ntherefore  propose  that  MITA  initiate  a  review  of   our\r\n\r\ncensorship policy on violence with a view to minimise its bad\r\n\r\ninfluence on our young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkfili Bin Baharudin: Sir, even after listening to\r\n\r\nProf. Toh, I am still of the view that a self-regulated press\r\n\r\ncommission  would  have  achieved the desired  objective  and\r\n\r\nprobably   would  have  censored  the  centrefold   that   he\r\n\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to my cut on censorship, the last Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  on censorship was done in 1992.  I must  say  that\r\n\r\nthey  must  be  credited for recommending  major  changes  in\r\n\r\ncensorship,  especially  for  its  role  in  stimulating  the\r\n\r\nmindset  changes  needed to balance the  growing  demand  for\r\n\r\ncreative  space and maintaining a morally wholesome  society.\r\n\r\nSince  then,  much  has  changed,  especially  in  terms   of\r\n\r\ntechnology  which makes it necessary and urgent  for  another\r\n\r\nreview  to  be done to address some of these dilemmas  facing\r\n\r\nthe censors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just explain a few examples. One, currently R(A)\r\n\r\nmovies  are  allowed  to  be screened in  specially  licensed\r\n\r\ntheatres outside public housing estates.  I really doubt,  in\r\n\r\na small country like ours, whether allowing such movies to be\r\n\r\nscreened  in  Orchard Road and not in Ang Mo  Kio,  is  still\r\n\r\nrelevant  today.   Two, there seems to be an anomaly  between\r\n\r\nwhat  is considered private and public consumption.  You  can\r\n\r\nsee  R(A) movies in cinemas because it is considered private.\r\n\r\nBut  you  cannot  possess the same CDs,  even  for  your  own\r\n\r\npersonal pleasure, as it is considered public simply  because\r\n\r\nof  the  ease of distribution.  Perhaps, we need to re-define\r\n\r\nsome of these terms and differentiate the rules regarding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccessibility,  possession  and  distribution.   The  present\r\n\r\ntools  appear  too blunt for what is now a more  complex  and\r\n\r\ndynamic  phenomenon.  For example, you can view  pornographic\r\n\r\nmaterials.  The policeman may be standing next to you and you\r\n\r\nstill  do  not  break the law.  But you cannot download  such\r\n\r\nmaterials as it may be tantamount to distribution of  obscene\r\n\r\nor objectionable materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ban on Cosmopolitan is still in force but many more\r\n\r\nsuch sites are available on the Internet.  Therefore, for the\r\n\r\nnew  review,  we  need to come out with a different  approach\r\n\r\nabout  regulating the media.  The review is  also  urgent  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with a growing problem of pornographic Internet  sites.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  in  a  survey  conducted  by  the  School   of\r\n\r\nCommunication  Studies  in NTU and  again  discussed  at  the\r\n\r\nFeedback Group Meeting, a large number of students were found\r\n\r\nto  have regular access to pornographic Internet sites.  Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, both young and adults, are, in fact, by-passing\r\n\r\nregulatory framework to access pornography on-line.  A higher\r\n\r\nproportion, some estimated to be as close as 90%, have access\r\n\r\nto pornography through Internet sites rather than traditional\r\n\r\nformats like magazines and video.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to find new and innovative ways to counter\r\n\r\nan  equally innovative content provider.  There is now strong\r\n\r\nsupport  on  the  need for a rating system to allow  Internet\r\n\r\nusers   to  make  their  own  choices,  like  having  content\r\n\r\nproviders  to  advise  the  public so  that  the  appropriate\r\n\r\nchoices   can   be   made.   We  need  to   balance   content\r\n\r\nclassification  about  outright  censorship  and  review  how\r\n\r\nfamily access network and a filtering software can be further\r\n\r\ndeveloped due to its less than encouraging popularity amongst\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to find better answers to balance the\r\n\r\ndilemma  between giving adults greater freedom of  choice  on\r\n\r\nthe one hand, and restricting access of undesirable materials\r\n\r\nto  young  and children on the other.  We also need  to  have\r\n\r\nmore  citizen  participation  and  consider  the  role,   for\r\n\r\nexample, of the Parents Advisory Group for Internet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(PAGI) which can be expected to take on a bigger role in  the\r\n\r\nface of more complex changes.  This is especially so when the\r\n\r\nsurvey  shows  that most parents really do not  know  how  to\r\n\r\nsupervise their children.  Citizen groups and civil societies\r\n\r\nshould also be encouraged to form censorship watch groups  to\r\n\r\ndevelop,  what  Minister George Yeo  calls,  a  civic  immune\r\n\r\nsystem.  Private sector players and service providers  should\r\n\r\nalso  be  made to play an active role to provide  cleaner  or\r\n\r\nfamily-friendly alternatives.  Censorship will  be  an  issue\r\n\r\nthat  we  need to deal with constantly and ad-hoc or periodic\r\n\r\nreviews may not be sufficient. Therefore, we need to find and\r\n\r\nput  in place a system to ensure that censorship laws do  not\r\n\r\nend up playing catch-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, during the past\r\n\r\nfew  years,  there have been quite a number of charity  shows\r\n\r\nover  TV  to  raise funds for the National Kidney  Foundation\r\n\r\n(NKF)  and the National Heart Association (NHA).    When  the\r\n\r\naudiences  see their TV artistes performing the stunts,  they\r\n\r\nwould  call  in  and  pay  $5 per call  to  contribute  their\r\n\r\ndonation.   For NKF and NHA charity shows, the   targets  for\r\n\r\nthe  amounts to be raised have become higher and higher, from\r\n\r\n$1  million  to $2 million.  Accordingly, the  stunts  to  be\r\n\r\nperformed  by  the  TV artistes on these  charity  shows  are\r\n\r\nbecoming more and more dangerous.  Many people think that the\r\n\r\nartistes  were  risking their lives with the  performance  of\r\n\r\nthese stunts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing charity is good but to ask artistes to risk their\r\n\r\nlives  for higher fund-raising targets is against the  spirit\r\n\r\nof  charity and good deeds. Artistes are not trained acrobats\r\n\r\nfrom  the circus and the spectators are not watching a circus\r\n\r\nperformance.   So why are they made to watch their  favourite\r\n\r\nTV  artistes pressing their bodies on  the spears and hanging\r\n\r\nupside down with a heavy chain tied to their necks until they\r\n\r\nalmost  suffocate.   What happens if  something  were  to  go\r\n\r\nwrong?  The  organisers stated that they had taken  insurance\r\n\r\ncoverage  for  these artistes.  This is  not  a  question  of\r\n\r\nhaving  insurance  coverage or not.   It  is  a  question  of\r\n\r\nconscience.  If you hang a dog upside\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown, the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA)\r\n\r\nwill  certainly lodge a protest and complain.   Do  you  want\r\n\r\nyour  children and family members to watch all these tortures\r\n\r\nto  their  favourite TV artistes before they are  willing  to\r\n\r\ncall  in and donate to charity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, our TV stations screened the programme called\r\n\r\n\"Super Change\" from Japan. In the programme, colleagues  from\r\n\r\nthe same company or members of the same family would team  up\r\n\r\nto  create some very creative scenes.  It is a very novel way\r\n\r\nto  promote creativity and at the same time encourage  family\r\n\r\nmembers   or  colleagues  from a company  to  work  and  play\r\n\r\ntogether  as  a  team, thereby fostering better  relationship\r\n\r\namong them.  Why do we not learn from them?  Instead, we  are\r\n\r\ngoing for violence and sadism.   With the further opening  up\r\n\r\nof the media and competition by a new TV station, I hope that\r\n\r\nthis  kind of  unhealthy programme will not appear again.   I\r\n\r\nhope that the media can exercise some restraint and that  the\r\n\r\nSBA  will  provide some kind of guidance.  If the TV  station\r\n\r\npersists  in torturing the  artistes, we should boycott  them\r\n\r\nby  not  calling  in  because it is no  longer  a  charitable\r\n\r\nperformance, but an act of violence and sadism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, MITA granted TV\r\n\r\nMobile licence for buses.  Ever since the launch, there  were\r\n\r\nmany  complaints  from the public.  The Straits  Times  Forum\r\n\r\npage  received 62 letters on TV Mobile.  Of these, only  five\r\n\r\nor  8%  were  in  favour of this so-called  innovation.

In\r\n\r\nview of the animosity towards TV Mobile, will MITA re-examine\r\n\r\nthe  current  licensing policies?

Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, Mr Seng Han Thong said\r\n\r\nthat  television programmes are to be watched.   By  Mr  Chew\r\n\r\nHeng  Ching's  example of WWF, Mr Seng's example  of  charity\r\n\r\nshows  and  if  you  want  another example,  the  example  of\r\n\r\n\"Survivor\",  I think we really need to look at the kind of TV\r\n\r\nprogrammes  we are paying for with our licence fees,  because\r\n\r\n\"Survivor\" does not teach us anything good at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We inherited from our former British rulers the idea of\r\n\r\na  State-run radio and TV station funded by licence fees.  In\r\n\r\nthose  days,  it  made  sense.  Radio and  TV  were  powerful\r\n\r\nchannels of communication to the masses and had to be closely\r\n\r\nregulated and licensed to prevent chaos and disorder.  And  I\r\n\r\nwonder perhaps maybe a bit of Second World War attitude where\r\n\r\nradios  could  be used to communicate with the enemy.   Those\r\n\r\ndays are gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radio and TV stations are private businesses now.\r\n\r\nLicences are anachronistic in the age of the Internet.  We do\r\n\r\nnot even need radios or TVs now to listen to radio programmes\r\n\r\nor  to  watch television narrowcasts.  The need still remains\r\n\r\nfor us to fund public service programmes and to encourage the\r\n\r\nproduction of programmes with local values and content - good\r\n\r\nvalues  and content also, I must add.  Because of  our  small\r\n\r\nmarket,  such programmes are expensive and cannot  solely  be\r\n\r\nfunded  by  advertising.  On the other hand, if they  are  so\r\n\r\nimportant  to  the national good, should they not  be  funded\r\n\r\nentirely  from  the Government budget, just as  education  or\r\n\r\nhealth care is?  I do admit that perhaps there could be  some\r\n\r\nform  of  co-payment from users according to use, if that  is\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us call a spade a spade. We are not paying for\r\n\r\nlicences  to  own  our  radios  or  TVs.   We  are  paying  a\r\n\r\nbroadcasting tax, or perhaps a fee for use, in which case  we\r\n\r\nshould  have  a  mechanism to ensure that  bigger  use  means\r\n\r\nbigger  fees.   And  lousy programmes do  not  get  my  fees!\r\n\r\nPerhaps  then the SBA would not need to explain   ad  nauseam\r\n\r\nwhy we still collect licence fees in this day and age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Sir, I wish to thank Members for their comments and\r\n\r\nsuggestions.  With their support and critical feedback,  MITA\r\n\r\naims  to  do more and hopefully better each year, to  realize\r\n\r\nour goal of turning Singapore into a vibrant, global city  of\r\n\r\nthe arts and media hub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on broadcasting and media issues\r\n\r\nraised  by  Mr Chew Heng Ching, Mr Seng Han Thong, Prof.  Toh\r\n\r\nSee  Kiat and Mr Zulkifli.  They have asked about the  impact\r\n\r\nof  competition on the media and how we should  regulate  the\r\n\r\nmedia  in this Internet age. Last June, I announced  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  issue an additional broadcasting licence to SPH  and  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper licence to MediaCorp. The liberalisation is to meet\r\n\r\npublic  desire for a greater variety of views and  programmes\r\n\r\nas  well  as to inject some competition into our local  media\r\n\r\nindustry.  The aim is to strengthen the local media  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  better  able to hold the attention  of  our  local\r\n\r\naudience  to share Singaporean viewpoints and experiences  in\r\n\r\nthe  face of increasing competition from foreign media across\r\n\r\nall media platforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constructive competition for the local media will\r\n\r\nattract  much  needed  talent, augment consumer  choice,  and\r\n\r\nimprove  the quality of local content in the long  term.  Our\r\n\r\nmedia  companies  will  have to be vigilant,  innovative  and\r\n\r\nadaptable  to stay ahead of the competition.  It  is  already\r\n\r\nevident that competition has injected new vigour to the local\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  Feedback has shown that Singaporeans welcome the\r\n\r\nexpanded  choice of newspapers and I am confident  that  each\r\n\r\nnewspaper  will find its place, with offerings  from  serious\r\n\r\nnews to entertainment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, there have been some concerns raised by\r\n\r\nMembers  and  others  on  the  need  for  standards   to   be\r\n\r\nmaintained, given the proliferation of English newspapers and\r\n\r\nadditional  TV channels following the liberalisation.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  Members that MITA shares this concern and is  closely\r\n\r\nmonitoring the situation.  We would like the local  media  to\r\n\r\nmaintain high journalistic standards and make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsound editorial judgements of what constitutes good taste and\r\n\r\ndecency.  Like Prof. Toh See Kiat and Mr Chew Heng  Ching,  I\r\n\r\nhave  also observed that there is an occasional tendency  for\r\n\r\nsome newspapers to  publish pictures which cross the line for\r\n\r\ngood  taste  and intrude into the privacy of some members  of\r\n\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two local media companies, in their drive to outdo\r\n\r\neach  other,  should also be mindful that  biased,  one-sided\r\n\r\nreporting  is  not  in  keeping  with  the  spirit  of   fair\r\n\r\ncompetition  and  professional conduct, especially  if  third\r\n\r\nparties are hurt in the process.  This is illustrated by  the\r\n\r\nnegative  coverage  of  the  recent  Miss  Singapore-Universe\r\n\r\nbeauty pageant. I thought the contestants did reasonably well\r\n\r\nconsidering the pressure that they were under with  the  live\r\n\r\ntelecast  to  many Singaporean viewers. However, the  reports\r\n\r\nthat  came  out  blasted  them for  being  \"beauties  without\r\n\r\nbrains.\"  This  was unfounded, ungracious and unfair  to  the\r\n\r\ncontestants.   The organisers did make some  slips  in  their\r\n\r\nfirst   attempt  at  live  broadcast  of  a  beauty  pageant.\r\n\r\nHowever, someone told me that the extremely negative  reports\r\n\r\nin  several newspapers could be partly because of  the  media\r\n\r\ncompetition.  I am not sure if there is any truth in that. In\r\n\r\nany  case,  I  would  expect our media companies  to  compete\r\n\r\nfairly  and  professionally, even if the report is  about  an\r\n\r\nevent  concerning their competitor. Our media should  compete\r\n\r\non the basis of better quality and not negative reporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proliferation of alternative viewpoints in the\r\n\r\nmedia, the public has to adopt a more discerning and critical\r\n\r\nattitude towards the information they receive. Any attempt by\r\n\r\nthe  local media players to dumb-down, sensationalise or stir\r\n\r\nup  controversial  issues  may  appeal  to  some  readers  or\r\n\r\naudience.    However,  it  could  also  damage  the   media's\r\n\r\ncredibility  and risk consumer backlash.  On our  part,  MITA\r\n\r\nwill   encourage   our  media  to  set  high   standards   of\r\n\r\nprofessionalism, accuracy and objectivity.  We  are  assisted\r\n\r\nin  our  efforts  by  several advisory bodies,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nPublications  Advisory Committee and the Programmes  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich include members from a wide cross section of society to\r\n\r\nreflect public opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked if the role of the Publications\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Committee (PAC) will be stepped up.  The  PAC  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  advise  MITA  on  the  content  and  trends  of\r\n\r\nnewspapers  and publications, consider complaints by  members\r\n\r\nof   the   public,   and  review  newspaper  and   publishing\r\n\r\nguidelines. MITA intends to tap on the PAC on a more  regular\r\n\r\nbasis.  The  PAC  will also submit an annual  report  of  its\r\n\r\nfindings  to MITA, similar to the practice of the  Programmes\r\n\r\nAdvisory Committee for the broadcasting industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh See Kiat and Mr Zulkifli have also proposed\r\n\r\nthe  setting up of media self-regulating bodies,  such  as  a\r\n\r\nMedia Watch Council, to set media ethics and standards.  This\r\n\r\nis  something   which the industry may wish to  consider  if,\r\n\r\ndespite  the  intense competition, it  is  able  to  reach  a\r\n\r\ngentleman's  understanding to subject itself  to  public  and\r\n\r\ncompetitor scrutiny.  It may not be practical yet to have  an\r\n\r\numbrella  body for the entire media industry as the different\r\n\r\ncomponents of press, broadcasting and Internet have different\r\n\r\ncharacteristics  and  functions.  MITA,  on  our  part,  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  exercise  overall responsibility,  through  the\r\n\r\nFilms   and   Publications  Department  and   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nBroadcasting Authority, to uphold high standards of print and\r\n\r\nbroadcast content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong has also asked if MITA has any\r\n\r\nguidelines  to  protect  Singaporeans  from  the  undesirable\r\n\r\noutcomes  of  foreign media competition.  Where  the  foreign\r\n\r\nmedia are concerned, the rules are simple. They operate  here\r\n\r\nas a matter of privilege and not of right. We welcome them to\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore and report on local developments, based  on\r\n\r\nthe  principle  of  accuracy, fairness and balance.  However,\r\n\r\nthey must not engage in our domestic politics, as this is the\r\n\r\npreserve of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Newspaper and Printing Presses Act already\r\n\r\nestablishes this policy in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelation   to  foreign  newspapers  and  magazines.   Foreign\r\n\r\npublications deemed to be engaging in domestic politics would\r\n\r\nhave  their  circulation restricted.   Over  the  years,  the\r\n\r\nforeign media have come around to accept this policy and  our\r\n\r\nright of reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA intends to extend this policy to include foreign\r\n\r\nbroadcasts in Singapore. I will soon be introducing a Bill to\r\n\r\namend the Singapore Broadcasting Authority Act to provide the\r\n\r\nMinister  with the power to declare any foreign  broadcasting\r\n\r\nservice to be engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  to  limit its distribution. The Minister can then impose\r\n\r\nconditions  on  errant  foreign  broadcasting  services.  The\r\n\r\nsystem  of regulations on foreign broadcasts will be  similar\r\n\r\nto  that  on  foreign newspapers.  Our  aim  is  not  to  ban\r\n\r\ninformation   but  to  restrict  subscriber  and  advertising\r\n\r\nrevenue to an errant channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching has suggested that we review our\r\n\r\ncensorship policy with regard to violence as portrayed in our\r\n\r\nmass  media.   The  next  review of  censorship  policy  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  focus  on  this important issue,  amongst  others.\r\n\r\nConcerning  violence  in TV programmes,  MITA  and  SBA  have\r\n\r\nreceived  very  few  public complaints, as broadcasters  have\r\n\r\ngenerally  conformed  with  the  guidelines  on  TV  violence\r\n\r\nstipulated  by  SBA's  TV  Programming  Code.   The  Code  is\r\n\r\nconstantly   updated,  incorporating  feedback   from   SBA's\r\n\r\nProgramme Advisory Committee (PAC) and the public, to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat it meets current requirements and expectations. The  PAC\r\n\r\nis  mindful that action movies with violent themes or  scenes\r\n\r\nare  not  appropriate for prime-time family viewing, and  SBA\r\n\r\nhas   advised  broadcasters  to  exercise  greater  care  and\r\n\r\nsensitivity  when  scheduling  programmes.   As  for  cartoon\r\n\r\nviolence,  no  major areas of concern have been expressed  by\r\n\r\nthe  public or SBA's Children's Programme Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, MITA will look into the cartoon called `Cow and\r\n\r\nChicken'  that Mr Chew has raised. SBA currently  funds  some\r\n\r\n1,500  hours  of local children's programmes annually.   This\r\n\r\nshould  hopefully provide some balance.  Concerning wrestling\r\n\r\nprogrammes on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSportscity, I am aware of the different opinions expressed in\r\n\r\nthe  Forum pages on this issue.  SBA will continue to monitor\r\n\r\nthis  area  to assess if further guidelines and  actions  are\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli has spoken eloquently on the need to review\r\n\r\nthe  censorship policies.  And as he has rightly pointed out,\r\n\r\nwe  have taken a light-touch approach with regard to Internet\r\n\r\nregulation  that  emphasises industry's  self-regulation  and\r\n\r\npublic education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member that the situation is\r\n\r\nnot  static.  Although the last review was done in 1992, over\r\n\r\nthe  years, as technology changes and with the advent of  the\r\n\r\nInternet,  the  Ministry  has  in  fact  moved  and  taken  a\r\n\r\npragmatic  approach.  For example, we have only  blacked  out\r\n\r\n100  sites, mostly pornography sites, as a statement  of  our\r\n\r\nvalues.   We  have  also  provided parents  with  alternative\r\n\r\naccess  to  what is known as the Family Access Network.   The\r\n\r\nquestion is how to make this network more effective  and  how\r\n\r\nto  introduce this network to more parents, some of whom  are\r\n\r\nnot  computer  literate or who may not be aware  of  what  is\r\n\r\navailable in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed out what he called certain inconsistency in\r\n\r\nour   guidelines.   This  could  be  partly  because  of  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  media.   It is obviously not possible  for  us  to\r\n\r\napply the rules of the Internet to the wider world.  Because,\r\n\r\nwith  the Internet, it is almost impossible to control.   But\r\n\r\nout  there  in  the  cinema, on our  TV  especially,  we  are\r\n\r\nespecially careful because these are open to all and  sundry,\r\n\r\nincluding  young children.  That is why we have  a  graduated\r\n\r\napproach  for  different categories of media, with  the  most\r\n\r\nsevere  being  for TV shows.  That is why although  we  allow\r\n\r\nR(A)  films to be shown in the cinemas, we do not allow  R(A)\r\n\r\nVCDs  in  the homes.  The thinking is that the VCDs could  be\r\n\r\nviewed  by children.  So that points out really to  the  need\r\n\r\nfor  self-regulation, for parents to have a  greater  say  in\r\n\r\nwhat  their children do and to decide for themselves what  is\r\n\r\nappropriate for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthemselves.  But anyway this is something that will  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  all looked into in the context of a future review of  the\r\n\r\ncensorship policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong raised a query with regard to the\r\n\r\nsafety  of  MediaCorp artistes performing in  charity  shows,\r\n\r\nthat efforts to attract audiences are not made at the expense\r\n\r\nof  safety.  I share the Member's apprehension.  I was  quite\r\n\r\nconcerned  last year when I saw a cyclist perform  an  aerial\r\n\r\njump  over  some local artistes lying on the stage.   If  any\r\n\r\nunforeseen accident had happened then, we would not  be  able\r\n\r\nto  see  some of our brightest stars on Caldecott Hill today.\r\n\r\nI  asked  my staff to check with MediaCorp whether  this  was\r\n\r\nnecessary.  They were told that the safety of the actors  and\r\n\r\nactresses  is a primary consideration.  Whenever  stunts  are\r\n\r\nperformed, maximum precautions are employed, and professional\r\n\r\ntrainers are on hand to help the artistes execute the  stunts\r\n\r\ncomfortably and confidently.  It does not make sense to  have\r\n\r\nthe  artistes hurt as this would harm MediaCorp's  reputation\r\n\r\nand  production efforts.  Nonetheless, I have asked MediaCorp\r\n\r\nto  be  extremely careful in deciding whether certain  stunts\r\n\r\nare really necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Prof. Toh See Kiat's query on PSB\r\n\r\nfunding  and  licence  fees.  This has also  been  raised  by\r\n\r\nseveral  persistent writers in the Forum pages.  Let  me  say\r\n\r\nthat  almost all the funds collected go to paying for  Public\r\n\r\nService   Broadcast  programmes.   These   pertain   to   the\r\n\r\nproduction  of  current affairs, local  drama,  and  minority\r\n\r\nlanguage  TV  and  radio shows which reflect our  Singaporean\r\n\r\nvalues  and way of life as well as local sports and  selected\r\n\r\narts  programmes. Such local programmes may  cost  up  to  30\r\n\r\ntimes  more  than  canned entertainment  programmes  acquired\r\n\r\noverseas and cannot be funded by advertisements alone.  For a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial, multi-lingual and multi-cultural  society  like\r\n\r\nSingapore, PSB programmes are a crucial element of our nation-building efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB programmes can either be funded through the\r\n\r\ncollection   of  radio  and  TV  licence  fees,  or   through\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxes.   We  have opted to collect radio and TV licence  fees\r\n\r\nbecause it is still the best way to fund PSB programmes.  The\r\n\r\nfee  is  not  used to fund local entertainment programmes  as\r\n\r\nthese  usually attract larger audiences.  Compared  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries such as the UK which also collect TV licence  fees,\r\n\r\nthe  licence  fees in Singapore are relatively low  and  have\r\n\r\nremained unchanged since 1994 at $110 per annum for a  colour\r\n\r\nTV  licence, or less than $10 per month, and $27  for  a  car\r\n\r\nradio  licence.   They are also low compared to  the  monthly\r\n\r\nfees for cable TV, which is something like $35 per month  for\r\n\r\na  basic  package.  In fact, most HDB residents who have  not\r\n\r\nsubscribed  to  cable TV have been enjoying  much  better  TV\r\n\r\nreception through cable without having to pay a cent more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin raised the issue of TV Mobile on buses and\r\n\r\nwhether we should review the granting of such licences.   Let\r\n\r\nme  say  that  TV  Mobile is part of the move  to  eventually\r\n\r\nintroduce  Digital  TV  services to  Singaporean  households.\r\n\r\nTraditional  broadcasting services are giving way  to  better\r\n\r\nquality,   interactive   and   mobile   forms   of    digital\r\n\r\nentertainment   and   information  in  developed   countries.\r\n\r\nAlready,  the US and Europe have launched full scale  Digital\r\n\r\nTV  services  and  are building up their digital  programming\r\n\r\ncapabilities with interactive services like email access  via\r\n\r\nTV.   Last month's launch of TV Mobile in Singapore, a  first\r\n\r\nin  the world, was done after a two-year feasibility study by\r\n\r\nMediaCorp, Singapore Bus Services, and SMRT, and a  one-month\r\n\r\npublic   trial   in  1999  which  received  positive   public\r\n\r\nresponses.    MediaCorp   is  also  currently   field-testing\r\n\r\nterrestrial  digital television broadcasting  with  some  200\r\n\r\nhomes  in preparation for a commercial DTV service launch  in\r\n\r\nthe near future.  DTV allows numerous new and better services\r\n\r\nto  be  introduced,  as  well  as higher  quality  broadcasts\r\n\r\nincluding High Definition TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of new services often involves change\r\n\r\nin  consumer behaviour.  Given time, the benefits will become\r\n\r\nevident.  We are living in exciting times;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  projects will thrive and others will fail, but we  must\r\n\r\nkeep  up  with  the  changes  and  make  them  work  for  us.\r\n\r\nMediaCorp  has already taken action to resolve  the  teething\r\n\r\nproblems  encountered with TV Mobile.   They  are  installing\r\n\r\nadditional  transmitters  to  improve  reception   and   also\r\n\r\nlowering the sound levels in buses.  MediaCorp will  also  be\r\n\r\nlooking  into other suggestions by the public to  improve  TV\r\n\r\nMobile.  It is in MCS' interest to win over the public to the\r\n\r\nvalue and benefits of TV Mobile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho also asked whether there are plans to introduce\r\n\r\nthis  scheme to other modes of transport.  The answer is yes.\r\n\r\nIf  it  works well, it will be extended to the MRT and taxis.\r\n\r\nBut,  of  course,  we  have  to first  overcome  some  public\r\n\r\nresistance  in the area of buses.  Perhaps one way  could  be\r\n\r\nfor  the bus commuters to buy a very simple radio set,  which\r\n\r\nmay  cost no more than $10 with earphones, which can be tuned\r\n\r\nto  channel 89.3, and they will be able to receive the  voice\r\n\r\nover the TV.  In that situation, we will be able to lower the\r\n\r\nvolume of the TV set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with issues raised by various Members\r\n\r\nregarding  the  arts scene.  The development  of  Singaporean\r\n\r\narts  and  artists  lies at the core of our Renaissance  City\r\n\r\nvision and the bulk of funding has gone into major grants for\r\n\r\ntop  arts  organisations.  The new two-year and annual  grant\r\n\r\nschemes  are  aimed at advancing the professional development\r\n\r\nof  our  local  arts  companies.   With  more  support,  arts\r\n\r\ncompanies  will  be  able to improve  the  quality  of  their\r\n\r\nproductions.  To date, four companies have received the  two-year  grant and 13 companies the annual grant.  I  think  the\r\n\r\ntotal  sum  involved for all these 17 companies is  something\r\n\r\nlike   $3.8  million.   Because  of  the  additional  funding\r\n\r\navailable  from this new Renaissance City scheme,  the  funds\r\n\r\nthat  would  otherwise have gone into these 17 companies  can\r\n\r\nnow  be  made available to other companies.  Hopefully,  many\r\n\r\nmore small arts companies would be able to benefit.  Many, in\r\n\r\nfact,  are  working  with PA in the CCs and  elsewhere.   NAC\r\n\r\nitself has to be selective because we have to really groom up\r\n\r\nthe best and not just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport all and sundry who want to dabble in the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More funds have also been expended on arts training.\r\n\r\nNAC  has  set  up  new  schemes for  skills  development  and\r\n\r\nprofessional  arts  scholarships.   We  recognise  that  arts\r\n\r\npractitioners,  arts  managers and production  personnel  are\r\n\r\ncrucial   to  the  production  process  of  the  arts.    The\r\n\r\nProfessional   Skills  Development   fund   is   to   provide\r\n\r\nopportunities for them to upgrade their skills through short-term  training courses locally or abroad.  NAC's Professional\r\n\r\nScholarship  Scheme  has  been set up  to  provide  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  to arts managers and practitioners  who  wish  to\r\n\r\npursue   full-time  undergraduate  or  postgraduate   studies\r\n\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also intensifying efforts to give international\r\n\r\nexposure  to  our top artists.  Examples of arts groups  that\r\n\r\nhave  performed  overseas  include  the  T'ang  Quartet,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Chinese  Orchestra,  TheatreWorks,  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nDance  Theatre.  Singapore will also be participating in  the\r\n\r\nprestigious Venice Biennale this June. The Biennale  features\r\n\r\ntop  and  emerging visual artists like painters and sculptors\r\n\r\nfrom around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major arts events will be improved upon qualitatively\r\n\r\nand  quantitatively.   The SPH-NAC Golden  Point  award,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  will  include a poetry section for the  first  time\r\n\r\nthis  year,  while the National Piano and Violin  Competition\r\n\r\nhas   plans  to  go  regional  in  the  near  future.   Other\r\n\r\nactivities that will contribute to the vibrancy of  the  arts\r\n\r\nscene  include Nokia Singapore Art and the Singapore  Writers\r\n\r\nFestival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also intensified arts outreach to the masses by\r\n\r\nbringing the arts to the community in the heartlands.  One of\r\n\r\nthe   activities  targeted  at  the  HDB  heartland  was  the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Arts Day last October, which was jointly organised\r\n\r\nby  NAC and Sembawang-Hong Kah CDC.  Another is the NAC-Shell\r\n\r\nCommunity  Arts  series  of outdoor concerts,  held  at  town\r\n\r\ncentres,  such  as  Clementi, Hougang and Yishun.   NAC  also\r\n\r\nactively  collaborates with the private sector to  bring  the\r\n\r\narts to the working population.  NAC joins hands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  Raffles  City to bring Arts in the City,  a  series  of\r\n\r\nregular  lunchtime concerts at the Raffles City  Atrium,  now\r\n\r\ninto its third year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also expanded our arts education programme to\r\n\r\nmore schools and students.  Currently we cover 86% of schools\r\n\r\nand  more than 50% of the student population. The AEP,  which\r\n\r\naims  to  bring  the arts to every student through  exposure,\r\n\r\nexperience   and  excursion  programmes,  was   extended   to\r\n\r\nInstitutes  of  Technical Education for the first  time  last\r\n\r\nyear.   NAC  hopes the AEP will reach out to all  schools  by\r\n\r\n2005.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the National Heritage Board (NHB) works\r\n\r\nclosely  with  Ministry of Education to promote awareness  of\r\n\r\nour multi-ethnic heritage among the younger generation. NHB's\r\n\r\noutreach   activities   include  the  Community   Involvement\r\n\r\nProgramme  for  schools,  the Heritage  Badge  for  uniformed\r\n\r\ngroups, travelling exhibitions, educational workshops, talks,\r\n\r\ncultural  performances  and other activities.   NHB  will  be\r\n\r\nholding  the  inaugural Heritage Festival  this  month.   The\r\n\r\nactivities  of the week-long festival, such as  talks,  music\r\n\r\nand  dance  performances  and demonstrations  of  traditional\r\n\r\ngames, will take place in various parts of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still at an early stage of our cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  In terms of the number of arts events,  artists\r\n\r\nand  audiences, we are behind cities like Melbourne and  Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  let alone London and New York.  The Renaissance  funds\r\n\r\nincreased  per capita annual arts expenditure from  about  $7\r\n\r\n(before  the  report) to $9 last year.  This is still  modest\r\n\r\ncompared to the cultural capitals of the world.  For example,\r\n\r\nLondon's  per capita spending is S$108, 12 times higher  than\r\n\r\nours  while Hong Kong's is nearly four times higher at  S$33.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  our  modest increase of 30%  last  year  is  a\r\n\r\nrelatively big step for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Jennifer Lee for her support of\r\n\r\nthe  arts and for her comments on the NAC.  I think  the  NAC\r\n\r\nhas  been doing a good job and it is true to some extent that\r\n\r\nit is difficult for NAC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  juggle both the roles of promoter as well as a funder and\r\n\r\nregulator.   This is why for plays like Talaq,  it  has  been\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  PELU,  which is under the  Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs,  to  take  the  final  decision,  based  on  various\r\n\r\nconsiderations,  including the views of MUIS  concerning  the\r\n\r\nreligious  sensitivity of the play.   The  Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  has  suggested that this function be transferred  to\r\n\r\nMITA.    This   is  something  that  we  are   now   actively\r\n\r\nconsidering.   If  it does come to MITA,  then  I  think  the\r\n\r\nlicensing and approval functions will go under our Films  and\r\n\r\nPublications  Department  and NAC  will  concentrate  on  the\r\n\r\npromotion of the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure all Members that in approving the\r\n\r\nstaging  of  plays  and  funding for the  arts,  we  exercise\r\n\r\nsensitivity  and flexibility so that local and  international\r\n\r\nworks   with   artistic  merit,  even  some   difficult   and\r\n\r\nprovocative ones, could be encouraged in Singapore.   But  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, we acknowledge that public funding  for  the\r\n\r\narts  should  be  prudent so as not to project  wrong  social\r\n\r\nvalues and to cause societal conflict.  For example, NAC  did\r\n\r\nnot  fund the musical Rent as it presented homosexuality  and\r\n\r\nalternative lifestyles as an accepted way of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate that MITA has clear guidelines\r\n\r\nand  criteria  for  the  support of  art  productions.   They\r\n\r\ninclude  artistic  merits and track  records  of  applicants.\r\n\r\nHowever,  for private sponsorship of the arts, we would  like\r\n\r\nto leave it to the respective corporations to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I move on to the next cut.

Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, some years ago, the NLB\r\n\r\nand the PCF collaborated on a very praiseworthy initiative to\r\n\r\nstart  community children's libraries (CCLs).  And currently,\r\n\r\nthe  CCLs  are doing a good job, promoting reading among  the\r\n\r\nvery young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the new economy where we want to have a good\r\n\r\nquality workforce, reading skills will be very important  for\r\n\r\nself-learning in this lifelong learning process.  So  indeed,\r\n\r\nit  was  a surprise to me to find out that there is  no  line\r\n\r\nitem  in  the  budget  for MITA, specifically  for  community\r\n\r\nchildren's  libraries.  As I understand it, it  is  run  from\r\n\r\nsavings  made in other parts of the NLB budget  and  while  I\r\n\r\nmust  praise the executives, like Dr Christopher Chia in NLB,\r\n\r\nI  think it is not right for incidental scraps from the other\r\n\r\npieces  of  the budget  to be given to CCLs which is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant initiative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the CCLs, as I understand it, are operating on a\r\n\r\ndeficit  and  even  those  who want to  introduce  innovative\r\n\r\nfinancing schemes, such as conducting fee-based courses,  are\r\n\r\nnot  allowed  to  do  so  in case they  run  afoul  of  their\r\n\r\ncharitable  status.   I would like to urge  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider more specific funding for CCL because this would  be\r\n\r\nneeded to train librarians at their local levels so that  the\r\n\r\nlevel of professionalism would be high and they will be  able\r\n\r\nto institute innovative programmes for the young.  This would\r\n\r\nalso  mean  more  books,  magazines, comics,  CDs  and  other\r\n\r\nresources  that  would teach children to be literate  and  to\r\n\r\nlove  books,  and,  of course, finally, for  the  operational\r\n\r\ncosts of the CCLs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> First of all, let me congratulate the\r\n\r\nNational  Library  Board  for  doing  an  excellent  job   in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the new libraries, particularly, at the  regional\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the topic of CCLs. Sir, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  in opening the first Community Children's  Library\r\n\r\nin Marine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParade,  called  for the creation of 100 CCLs  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSince  then,  many  CCLs  have been  developed  in  many  HDB\r\n\r\nestates.   However,  with  the  creation  of  these  regional\r\n\r\nlibraries,  there appears to be a tussle for the same  target\r\n\r\nusers of children below the age of 12 years group.  The  only\r\n\r\ndifference  in the two types of libraries is that  membership\r\n\r\nat  the  NLB libraries is free, while at the CCLs,  they  are\r\n\r\ncharged  $24  per  year.   In view of  the  location  of  the\r\n\r\nregional  libraries, there are books catering also  to  adult\r\n\r\nfamily  members and an equally good collection of  children's\r\n\r\nbooks.  They actually end up competing with CCLs for the same\r\n\r\nage  group child users.  In the light of this competition and\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that CCLs are heavily subsidised by the local  PCF\r\n\r\ncommittee,  I  would  like to ask the Minister  whether  MITA\r\n\r\nintends to fully develop all 100 CCLs as originally envisaged\r\n\r\nor whether there will be a rethink on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang :</b> Sir, can I take the two cuts\r\n\r\ntogether?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, recently, there\r\n\r\nwas  a very popular Chinese movie whose title in English  was\r\n\r\nCrouching  Tiger and Hidden Dragon.    I did  not  understand\r\n\r\nthe  meaning  of it. Subsequently, I learnt that the  Chinese\r\n\r\ntitle to this movie was   Wo hu cang long.  The English title\r\n\r\nappears to be a literal translation of the Chinese title and,\r\n\r\nas it appears, it makes no sense at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of weeks ago, I came across a bilingual booklet\r\n\r\npublished by the Speak Mandarin Campaign Committee.   On  one\r\n\r\nof the pages, I saw a name which sounded somewhat familiar  - Wu Jun Gang.  I did not know who it was referring to.  It was\r\n\r\nonly when I read the Chinese section that I realised that  it\r\n\r\nwas  referring to me, but my name \"Goh Choon Kang\" was  spelt\r\n\r\nas  \"Wu  Jun Gang\".  I do not know who translated it,  but  I\r\n\r\nguess it must have been translated by a Chinese national  who\r\n\r\ndoes not know the who's who in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these two examples, we can see that very often,\r\n\r\npeople  do  not  pay much attention to the translation  work.\r\n\r\nThe  talents  in  the  field  of translation  are  often  not\r\n\r\naccorded  the recognition and respect they deserve. Probably,\r\n\r\nthis  is due to a lack of awareness of the importance of  the\r\n\r\ntranslators or interpreters among our people.  Perhaps,  they\r\n\r\nare   misled   by   preconceived   ideas   that,   with   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  bilingualism  in  our  education  system,\r\n\r\neverybody  knows two languages and therefore there is no need\r\n\r\nfor translation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we were made a laughing stock. The Chinese\r\n\r\nversion  of  our  publicity booklet \"Contact  Singapore\"  was\r\n\r\ndistributed in China.  In this booklet, the Prime Minister of\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  wrongly translated as Shou Xiang  instead  of\r\n\r\nZong Li.  The language used in this booklet was also full  of\r\n\r\nmistakes.   A reader of Lianhe Zaobao wrote to the  newspaper\r\n\r\nand  described it as unbearable.  Many Singaporeans feel that\r\n\r\nthis  is indeed a disgrace to Singapore. Actually, we do  not\r\n\r\nlack talents in this field, but the trouble is they have  not\r\n\r\nbeen accorded the due stature and respect they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of Prime Minister can be expressed in Chinese\r\n\r\nin   two  distinct  ways.   Generally,  \"Prime  Minister\"  is\r\n\r\ntranslated  as  Zong Li.  It is only in countries  where  the\r\n\r\nmonarchy  system is practised, eg, Japan, the United Kingdom,\r\n\r\nThailand, that the Prime Minister is known as Shou  Xiang  in\r\n\r\nChinese. If we were to address our   Prime Minister  as  Shou\r\n\r\nXiang, then our President will become a King.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue may appear to have no relevance to MITA.\r\n\r\nBut,  had  the  translation of this  publicity  booklet  been\r\n\r\nvetted  by  the Translation Section of MITA, such unnecessary\r\n\r\nmistakes  could have been avoided, and we can be  spared  the\r\n\r\nagony of being disgraced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my understanding, there are only four translators in\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  Translation  Section  in  MITA  today.  If  all\r\n\r\ntranslation works required by the various ministries  are  to\r\n\r\nbe undertaken by this small section of translators, then they\r\n\r\nwould not be able to cope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we are going regional and global, I think we\r\n\r\nshould  also recognise the importance of translation experts.\r\n\r\nWe  must give them the proper remuneration and promptly groom\r\n\r\nup  their  successors.  Right now, it is  very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nrecruit   good   translators  and  interpreters.    Even   in\r\n\r\nParliament  itself, there is great difficulty  in  recruiting\r\n\r\ngood   part-time  interpreters.   I  observe   that   veteran\r\n\r\ninterpreter like  Mr Lee Seng Giap has been helping out  here\r\n\r\nfor  a  very   long time, and he has still  to come  here  to\r\n\r\nassist our resident interpreter even today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Government seriously\r\n\r\nconsider the setting up of a Central Translation Bureau,  and\r\n\r\nrecruit  some  first-class translators  to  provide  all  the\r\n\r\nofficial translations of the Government, like the way  it  is\r\n\r\ndone  in  Hong  Kong,  so as to avoid the  kind  of  mistakes\r\n\r\ncommitted in the \"Contact Singapore\" pamphlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attractive remuneration package must be offered to\r\n\r\nattract   some  first-class  translators  to  translate   the\r\n\r\nofficial  documents and publications of the Government  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  authoritative and to support the  public  relations\r\n\r\nofficers  of  the  various Government  Ministries.   This  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  also because it is very difficult to get bilingual\r\n\r\npeople  to be our Public Relations Officer.  By so doing,  we\r\n\r\nwill be able to establish translation and interpretation as a\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to raise another related issue, that\r\n\r\nis,    the   setting  up  of  a  committee  on   standardised\r\n\r\ntranslation  of  names  and terms.  Right  now,  we  have  an\r\n\r\ninformal   kind  of  committee  in  charge  of   standardised\r\n\r\ntranslation  of names and terms.  The members come  from  the\r\n\r\nChinese media and representatives from MITA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been the Chairman of this committee for the past\r\n\r\nthree years.  I feel that the kind of work undertaken by this\r\n\r\ncommittee is very important, albeit very few people  know  of\r\n\r\nits existence. The important main task of this committee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  to  come out with a standardised translation of all   new\r\n\r\nterms  so  that  all Chinese media, TV stations,  newspapers,\r\n\r\netc,  could adopt.  This committee has published a number  of\r\n\r\nbooklets,   like  the  booklet  on  the  standardisation   of\r\n\r\ntranslation  of Government departments, IT terminologies  and\r\n\r\neconomic  terminologies,  etc.  These  are  all  very  useful\r\n\r\npublications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because this committee is informal,\r\n\r\norganisationally  it is a bit loose and it  lacks  authority.\r\n\r\nIf  we  can  officially establish a committee on standardised\r\n\r\ntranslation of names and terms, and secure an expert in  this\r\n\r\nfield to head the committee, then the committee will be  more\r\n\r\nauthoritative and more effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, the Singapore Film Commission has\r\n\r\nbeen  formed  to promote the film industry in Singapore.

How much has been  spent  and  what\r\n\r\nachievements  have  been  made?   What  are   some   of   the\r\n\r\nfundamental  issues confronting the film  industry  and  what\r\n\r\nmeasures  would be taken to overcome them?  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  to the Singapore Film Commission to widen its  scope\r\n\r\nof work to include the nurture  and training of local talents\r\n\r\nfor  both  the  front  end and back end production  of  local\r\n\r\nmovies.  When bringing in instructors and course leaders,  we\r\n\r\nshould widen the scope to include also professionals from the\r\n\r\nEast - from Hong Kong, from China and Japan - where there are\r\n\r\nmany well-known producers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Film Commission should also help in\r\n\r\nbuilding   up  the  supporting  industry,  such  as  dubbing,\r\n\r\nanimation  and  post-production houses.  Sir,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nFilm Commission could work closely with the Singapore Tourism\r\n\r\nBoard  to  promote  Singapore as a good location  for  making\r\n\r\nmovies.   Promoting Singapore as an international  production\r\n\r\ncentre,  we encourage the use of Singapore location,  service\r\n\r\nfacilities   and  personnel.   We  could  provide   financial\r\n\r\nincentives for foreign film makers to come to Singapore.

I shall try to\r\n\r\nbe brief, in view of the fact that time is running on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take the cuts first on the questions on the\r\n\r\nNational Library and the Community Children's Library  (CCL).\r\n\r\nBut  before I do so, I would just want to make a point  about\r\n\r\npublic education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a speech on Monday, when this House debated the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance's Budget Statement, Mrs Lim  Hwee  Hua\r\n\r\nspoke   of   the  psychological  divide  between  those   who\r\n\r\nunderstand and accept change, and those who do not.  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  an  important idea that we should  give  some\r\n\r\nattention  to.  What challenges and divides us are  not  just\r\n\r\nthe  things we have or do not have, but the understanding and\r\n\r\nrapport we have or do not have with each other.  Her plea was\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  should do more to  close  this  divide\r\n\r\nthrough public education and, specifically, that more  should\r\n\r\nbe  done  to explain Government policy.  I agree, but  public\r\n\r\neducation is a broad concept that applies also to raising the\r\n\r\ngeneral level of awareness and knowledge, not just of  public\r\n\r\npolicies or technical subjects, but also of the arts  and  of\r\n\r\ngeneral knowledge.  In our society, where we will become more\r\n\r\ndiverse  in interests and viewpoints, a broader knowledge  of\r\n\r\nthe  world  around us will give people more common points  to\r\n\r\nrelate to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context that our libraries contribute\r\n\r\nsignificantly to this broad goal.  I thank the  speakers  who\r\n\r\nhave  acknowledged the accomplishments of our Library  Board.\r\n\r\nThey  have  achieved  a revolutionary breakthrough  in  their\r\n\r\nmission  to enhance interest and capacity for learning  among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  They have tried out innovative ideas like  the\r\n\r\nLibrary@Orchard, and the use of radio frequency technology to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the loan and return of books.  By sheer hard work,\r\n\r\nI  think  they  have  achieved  international  attention  and\r\n\r\nrecognition, and I am glad to say that Singaporeans can  look\r\n\r\nforward to a new National Library building in the year 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to Mr Chew's specific question about the NLB\r\n\r\nbuilding.   The  NLB  tender for the  new  NLB  building  was\r\n\r\noriginally intended to be awarded as a design contract and  a\r\n\r\nseparate  construction  contract.  The  design  contract  was\r\n\r\nawarded  to  a consortium led by Swan & MacLaren  Architects.\r\n\r\nAs   the   project  progressed,  however,  the   NLB   became\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  with  the consortium, as they  were  unable  to\r\n\r\nassign adequate resources to the project and the project  had\r\n\r\nbegun  to slip behind schedule.  However, the consortium  had\r\n\r\nalready completed the architectural schematic design for  the\r\n\r\nnew building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, NLB then decided to complete the project under a\r\n\r\ndevelop-and-construct arrangement, in order to avoid  further\r\n\r\ndelays   and   slippage  to  the  project   schedule.    This\r\n\r\narrangement is a variation of the design-and-build  approach.\r\n\r\nUnder  design-and-build,  the  contractor  undertakes  design\r\n\r\nresponsibility,   in   addition  to  the   construction   and\r\n\r\ncompletion of the building.  In this instance, however, there\r\n\r\nwas  no  need  for  a  re-design of the building,  since  the\r\n\r\nschematic  design had already been done.  For NLB's  develop-and-construct  approach,  a  main contractor  will  undertake\r\n\r\ndetailed   design,  based  on  the  completed   architectural\r\n\r\nschematic  design,  and construct the building.   This  saves\r\n\r\ntime and costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under this approach, the NLB maintains\r\n\r\ncontrol over design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintegrity,   through   the  schematic   design,   while   the\r\n\r\ncontractor,  being responsible for detailed design,  will  be\r\n\r\nable   to  enhance  the  construction  buildability,   design\r\n\r\nefficiency,   and   construction   methodology    to    boost\r\n\r\nproductivity  and  also, thereby, to  reclaim  whatever  cost\r\n\r\nsavings that may be possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such arrangements are in line with the Building and\r\n\r\nConstruction Authority's Construction 21 strategy to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthe professionalism of the construction industry.  NLB called\r\n\r\nthe tender on 19th January this year, and expects the new NLB\r\n\r\nbuilding to be completed in 2004.  Since the tender  has  not\r\n\r\nyet  been  awarded I cannot give you specific cost  data  and\r\n\r\nwhether or not there will be savings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of libraries, let me now turn to CCLs.\r\n\r\nNLB has a special commitment to our young readers, and we  do\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  inculcating the reading habit from a young  age.\r\n\r\nAnd,  because  of  this,  we have set up  special  children's\r\n\r\nsections  in  both  regional and community libraries,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran  has pointed out.  But Mr Ravindran  and  Prof  Toh\r\n\r\nhave  raised quite different points of view.  Prof Toh thinks\r\n\r\nwe  should  put  more  money in;  Mr Ravindran  thinks  that,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  some  CCLs  should  not  be  built  because   these\r\n\r\nfacilities  are  duplicated  in the  regional  and  community\r\n\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is not just one of money. CCLs are intended\r\n\r\nas complementary facilities, but, when we locate them in void\r\n\r\ndecks,  we brought the library closer to the homes  of  young\r\n\r\nchildren.   In  doing so, however, we limited  the  range  of\r\n\r\nbooks  and facilities that we can offer, and that is  because\r\n\r\nthey  now serve a much smaller catchment, so you cannot  have\r\n\r\nthem  on  a  same scale.  Some parents, therefore, prefer  to\r\n\r\nbring  their children to the community libraries and regional\r\n\r\nlibraries   because  of  the  wider  variety  of  books   and\r\n\r\nfacilities, and also because it is free.  Others  prefer  the\r\n\r\nconvenience  of  having a library near their homes,  so  they\r\n\r\ntake them to the CCLs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So CCLs can only work well if we have the support of the\r\n\r\ncommunity  where they are located.  If there  are  sufficient\r\n\r\nnumbers of parents in the locality who want this facility and\r\n\r\na  critical  mass can be formed, then there  will  be  enough\r\n\r\nscale  to make a success of the project.  But CCLs that  lack\r\n\r\ncommunity will not succeed even with more Government funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move to Dr Ho's query on the film industry in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Dr Ho will be happy to know that, over  the  last\r\n\r\nthree years, from 1998 to 2000, Singapore produced 17 feature\r\n\r\nfilms, or an average of about six films a year.  One, \"Eating\r\n\r\nAir\", has been shown at the Deauville Asian Film Festival  in\r\n\r\nFrance just recently.  Another five are in production or have\r\n\r\nbeen  completed, and should be released this year.  The  Film\r\n\r\nCommission  has also given out six letters of intent  so  far\r\n\r\nfor  feature film investment.  One film, \"Chicken Rice  War\",\r\n\r\nwhich  you  may have caught, has been released.   One  is  in\r\n\r\nproduction, three are looking for top-up funds, and the  last\r\n\r\none  withdrew  because  it already  has  enough  funds.   But\r\n\r\ncompared  with  the  early 1960s, the  heydays  of  our  film\r\n\r\nindustry, we are still some way behind.  Then, we produced 18\r\n\r\nfilms a year; now, we are only doing about six.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give a boost to this industry, the Commission takes a\r\n\r\nmore  generous  approach when it comes to giving  grants  for\r\n\r\nshort  films, because it is on short films that  film  makers\r\n\r\ncut  their teeth.  Last year, it awarded grants for 35  short\r\n\r\nfilms,  bringing  the overall total to 66 grants  made  since\r\n\r\n1988.   The  Commission also believes in  the  importance  of\r\n\r\nnurturing  local  talent.  To this end, it  has  awarded  two\r\n\r\noverseas scholarships and 11 bursaries, and has invited eight\r\n\r\nwell-known  film  makers  and  experts  to  conduct   special\r\n\r\nseminars,  master  classes  and  scriptwriting  workshops  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I agree with Dr Ho's suggestion that getting film\r\n\r\nmakers  to  produce their movies in Singapore  will  generate\r\n\r\nspin-offs  for  the economy in general, and  the  local  film\r\n\r\nindustry  in  particular, and MITA will  encourage  the  Film\r\n\r\nCommission  to  continue their work with EDB, STB  and  other\r\n\r\nindustry experts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto make Singapore a regional hub for film production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I turn to Mr Goh's comments on the need for a\r\n\r\nCentral  Translation Bureau and standards of  translation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I  agree with Mr Goh concerning his observations\r\n\r\nthat  we need to do more to raise the standards.  Mr Goh  has\r\n\r\npointed  out  the  difficulty  of  hiring  highly  proficient\r\n\r\ntranslators  in the civil service, and this is  a  need  that\r\n\r\nneeds to be seriously addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh has proposed that we set up a Central Translation\r\n\r\nBureau.  This may not solve the problem.  The translation and\r\n\r\ninterpretation services in the Government were  decentralised\r\n\r\nin   1981   and  reviewed  in  1985.   We  felt   that   this\r\n\r\ndecentralised  arrangement  is  better,  as  translators  and\r\n\r\ninterpreters  need to be aware of the relevant  policies  and\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  correct terms.  So placing them  out  with  the\r\n\r\ndifferent Ministries and Organs of State is better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this arrangement, MITA's Translation Service\r\n\r\nSection  focuses its resource only on its core responsibility\r\n\r\nof  providing translation services to Government leaders, and\r\n\r\ntranslating MITA materials meant for public consumption.  But\r\n\r\nI  agree  with Mr Goh that we should upgrade our professional\r\n\r\ntranslation standards, and MITA will raise this with PSD  and\r\n\r\nwork with it to see how the scheme of service for translators\r\n\r\nand interpreters can be made more attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh has also suggested that MITA standardise the\r\n\r\ntranslation of certain terms, especially the names of  titles\r\n\r\nand   programmes  in  the  Government.   I  agree  with   his\r\n\r\nsuggestion,  and  MITA will consider Mr Goh's  suggestion  to\r\n\r\nformalise   and   appoint   a   Translation   Standardisation\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, transparency and\r\n\r\naccountability are principles by which democratic governments\r\n\r\nare  governed  by these days.  The change in the  culture  of\r\n\r\ngovernance has, in part, been motivated by a desire,  as  far\r\n\r\nas  possible, and without compromising on national  security,\r\n\r\nto  free up information to the people so as to allow them  to\r\n\r\nmake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformed choices.  Not only that, it also serves as  a  check\r\n\r\nagainst  the excesses of government.  Increasingly, there  is\r\n\r\nmuch expectation by the people for the government to free  up\r\n\r\nas  much  information as possible.  Knowledge is, of  course,\r\n\r\npower.  It will be difficult to fully justify our position as\r\n\r\na   knowledge-based  economy  if  there  are  many  plugs  to\r\n\r\ninformation flows.  Besides, there is always this deep-seated\r\n\r\nsuspicion,  if  government and public affairs are  constantly\r\n\r\nshrouded in secrecy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many western countries, freedom of information\r\n\r\nlegislation is becoming increasingly a necessary part of  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  landscape.   In the US, for  instance,  it  has  a\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act that enables its citizens to  gain\r\n\r\naccess   to  records  kept  by  government  departments   and\r\n\r\nagencies.  In the UK, the government periodically reviews and\r\n\r\ndeclassifies information for release to the public.  It  goes\r\n\r\nwithout  saying  that the fact that many of  these  documents\r\n\r\nwill one day be public documents, does have a salutary effect\r\n\r\non civil servants and politicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, broadly, there are two facets to the issue of\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  information.  First, there is  a  right  of  the\r\n\r\nindividual  to  information amassed on him by  others.   Very\r\n\r\noften,  decisions are made based on information  provided  by\r\n\r\nothers.  For those who are affected by adverse decisions,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be unfortunate indeed if they are not given a clue  as\r\n\r\nto,  or  the  opportunity to know, the basis on  which  these\r\n\r\ndecisions  are made.  I can, for instance, think of appraisal\r\n\r\nrecords,   or   the  reason  behind  certain   administrative\r\n\r\ndecisions.   At the very least, if such information  is  made\r\n\r\navailable  to  the  person, there is an opportunity  to  have\r\n\r\nthese  records corrected, if they were erroneous.   Secondly,\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  information  envisages the  regular  reviews  of\r\n\r\npublic  documents and information for release to the  public,\r\n\r\nif possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In undertaking this exercise, besides the issue of\r\n\r\ntransparency and accountability, it will also have the effect\r\n\r\nof educating our people on the circumstances surrounding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain  events  and why certain decisions  or  policies  are\r\n\r\ntaken.  This will help our posterity in avoiding some of  the\r\n\r\nerrors perhaps that were committed earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the above reasons, I would therefore, urge the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider looking into the possibility of enacting\r\n\r\na Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Sir, in\r\n\r\nreply  to  Mr  Sin  Boon  Ann's  query  on  the  freedom   of\r\n\r\ninformation,  MITA recognises that the National  Archives  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  rich  repository  of  historical  data  and\r\n\r\npictures  that are invaluable to researchers and  historians.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore, the majority of public records transferred  to\r\n\r\nthe   National   Archives   are   systematically   appraised,\r\n\r\ndeclassified  and released in consultation with the  relevant\r\n\r\nMinistries.  As stipulated in the National Heritage Board Act\r\n\r\nin  1993 and in line with international practice, most of the\r\n\r\nmaterials  in  the  archives are made  available  for  public\r\n\r\nconsultation  after a 25-year period.  Records which  contain\r\n\r\nsensitive information may have a longer embargo period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin cited the situation in other countries - the US,\r\n\r\nCanada  and UK.  I would like to point out that although  the\r\n\r\nUS  and  Canada  each has a Freedom of Information  Act,  the\r\n\r\nrelease of information is still subject to certain disclosure\r\n\r\nconditions.  For example, the disclosure of records must  not\r\n\r\nbe  injurious to the conduct of the Government, threaten  the\r\n\r\nsafety of individuals or nation, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, on behalf of Members who\r\n\r\nspoke,  I  thank  the Minister and his colleagues  for  their\r\n\r\nreplies.

Sir, Internet has always remained as a medium  to\r\n\r\nexchange views freely and anonymously.  It will remain so for\r\n\r\na   long  time.   In  our  view,  instead  of  resorting   to\r\n\r\nlegislation,  it will be more meaningful to emphasise  common\r\n\r\nsense  and  public  awareness on  the  dangers  of  Internet.\r\n\r\nPublic  education,  for example, through  PAG(i)  is  another\r\n\r\neffort  that  we could mention.

I would like to  highlight  some\r\n\r\ngood  and negative points of the various channels run by MCS.\r\n\r\nLet me first start off with Channel NewsAsia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that Channel NewsAsia has\r\n\r\ndistinguished  itself as an Asian television station  with  a\r\n\r\ndeep  understanding of Asian affairs.  Their current  affairs\r\n\r\nprogrammes have intellectual depth, and they have always  got\r\n\r\nthe  best  in  the  different fields  to  comment  on  issues\r\n\r\naffecting  the  region.  In doing so, they  have  managed  to\r\n\r\ncapture  a  good  segment  of  the  political,  business  and\r\n\r\nacademic  audience.  I congratulate them on  their  excellent\r\n\r\nwork and I hope that they will make this Channel a station to\r\n\r\nbe watched by everyone with a keen interest in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must ask MCS to look at two important issues.\r\n\r\nThe  first is the inadequate reach of Channel NewsAsia in the\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries.  There is no provision  for  Channel\r\n\r\nNewsAsia  in many of the leading hotels in the region  and  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  MCS will work harder to sell Channel NewsAsia  in\r\n\r\nthe  region.  The second is the parallel broadcast of Channel\r\n\r\nNewsAsia programmes in the morning from 6.30 to 9.30 on  both\r\n\r\nChannel 5 and Channel NewsAsia.  I think this is a pure waste\r\n\r\nof  time and I hope that the Ministry can look into how  best\r\n\r\nthe  broadcast  time-slots can be better used  on  Channel  5\r\n\r\nduring this time period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to Channel 5. The issue of having multi-ethnic casts in local dramas is a matter of concern to many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  It is no use for the Prime Minister and  other\r\n\r\nleaders to talk about multi-racialism and integration if  the\r\n\r\nbroadcast  media, which is a macrocosm of Singapore  society,\r\n\r\ndoes  not  reflect the same in its programmes.  We must  show\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and the world which watch our programmes that we\r\n\r\nare  indeed  a  multi-racial society and our programmes  must\r\n\r\nreflect  this.   We  do  not want the  world  to  think  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is a Chinese, Malay or an Indian society, depending\r\n\r\non  what  language is used in the Singapore  drama.   I  have\r\n\r\ngiven up hope that MCS has understood the numerous calls from\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  to  re-assess the way it portrays Singapore  society,\r\n\r\nespecially  one  that involves Singapore society  and  multi-ethnic  Singapore.    The new dramas fail  to  truly  reflect\r\n\r\nSingapore  society.  This could be due to the fact that  both\r\n\r\nChannels  5  and  8 are under the same corporate  management,\r\n\r\nwhile  Suria  and  Vasantham Central are  under  a  different\r\n\r\ncorporate  management.   We have to  carefully  look  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether  the  MCS management, producers and scriptwriters  of\r\n\r\nlocal programmes really understand Singapore society, whether\r\n\r\nthey  do  mingle and have friends from various ethnic groups,\r\n\r\nand if they do not, whether there is a need for a process  of\r\n\r\norientating  these  key individuals on what  makes  Singapore\r\n\r\nunique  and their important role in reflecting this  tapestry\r\n\r\nof Singapore society in their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to the day where many more television\r\n\r\nproductions,  which  are truly local  and  multi-racial,  are\r\n\r\nproduced and which reflect Singapore society as they are.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  new station under MediaWorks will not  follow  the\r\n\r\ningrained footprints of MCS, but is creative and bold  enough\r\n\r\nto  reflect  the real Singapore society in their  dramas  and\r\n\r\nother  programmes. If the broadcast media does not understand\r\n\r\nthis  important role and do something about it, then  we  can\r\n\r\ncontinue to talk about multi-racialism and integration  until\r\n\r\nthe  cows  come  home, literally, the task of preserving  and\r\n\r\npromoting  multi-racialism would certainly become  an  uphill\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to Vasantham Central and be brief here.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I must say that programmes on Vasantham Central\r\n\r\nhave  improved  very drastically.  Last year,  I  highlighted\r\n\r\nthat  there  was  a need to reconsider whether  Hindi  movies\r\n\r\ncould be moved to Suria.  Indeed, what I notice is that Suria\r\n\r\nnow  has  Hindi  movies,  but in addition  to  the  slots  on\r\n\r\nVasantham Central.  My first question is:  is there a need to\r\n\r\nbroadcast  Hindi  movies on both Suria and Vasantham  Central\r\n\r\nwhen the idea was to free up Vasantham Central for more Tamil\r\n\r\neducational programmes?  The second query that I have is,  in\r\n\r\nthe  light  of  comments made on Hindi  movies  in  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwhether there have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimilar comments on Hindi movies in Singapore and whether the\r\n\r\nMinistry is looking into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, in respect of local sporting programmes, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to urge MCS to see whether we can increase funding  for\r\n\r\nlocal   sports  broadcasts,  particularly  live  events   and\r\n\r\nespecially school competitions.  Those are my comments, and I\r\n\r\nhope that the Minister can look into them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Mr Ravindran raised four questions\r\n\r\nin  relation to our television programming, Channel NewsAsia,\r\n\r\nChannel 5, Vasantham Central and Sportscity.  I would like to\r\n\r\nsay  that  he has been following the developments in  Channel\r\n\r\nNewsAsia and we are happy to learn that he is now saying that\r\n\r\nit  is  making  good  progress.  Of course,  I  realise  that\r\n\r\nChannel  NewsAsia  is moving to expand its  coverage  in  the\r\n\r\nregion, and it is doing it stage by stage.  I understand that\r\n\r\nCNA  has been sending its people to India, Nepal and Thailand\r\n\r\nand  that this is the kind of marketing which requires  time.\r\n\r\nI  believe  the  time will come when the  Member  visits  New\r\n\r\nDelhi, he will see Channel NewsAsia being shown there.  We do\r\n\r\nhope that when he is in Cambodia, he will be able to see news\r\n\r\nreporting by Channel NewsAsia.  I think it has been done  now\r\n\r\nbut it takes some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the need to have multi-ethnicity projected through\r\n\r\nour television media, I think this is a critical question.  I\r\n\r\ndo  agree that it is important for our media, especially  the\r\n\r\nlocal  media,  to  project the kind of  multi-ethnicity  that\r\n\r\nSingapore possesses, its richness and the way multi-ethnicity\r\n\r\nin  Singapore develops and works.  But we must recognise that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  limit.  For example, if you  have  a  drama  on\r\n\r\nclassical Chinese stories, shot somewhere in Beijing,  it  is\r\n\r\nimpossible to have Indian or Malay characters be placed  into\r\n\r\nthat  kind of story.  But on local modern dramas produced  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I think it is crucial for the Channel to  reflect\r\n\r\nthe  reality of our country and use this to their  advantage.\r\n\r\nI think the scriptwriters are aware of this requirement and I\r\n\r\nhave seen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  number  of them making efforts to move into this  area  of\r\n\r\nprojecting  Malay/Indian characters  in  Chinese  dramas  and\r\n\r\nlikewise in the Malay dramas, you have Indian characters  who\r\n\r\ncould  speak  in  Malay, trying to interact  with  the  Malay\r\n\r\nactors  to project the reality in Singapore.  But, as I  said\r\n\r\nearlier, this requires some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Vasantham Central, we will ask\r\n\r\nMediaCorp  to  look into it and see how Suria  and  Vasantham\r\n\r\nCentral  could  also  play  this role  of  projecting  multi-ethnicity to their respective communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on Sportscity, I understand that sports is a\r\n\r\nvery passionate event.  It is very close to our hearts and as\r\n\r\nlocals, it is not wrong for us to expect Sportscity to  cover\r\n\r\nmore  local events.  But we leave it to MediaCorp  to  decide\r\n\r\nbecause there is also the economic consideration.  They  must\r\n\r\nweigh the balance between the viability of the programme, its\r\n\r\nattractiveness  and  our objective of  projecting  the  local\r\n\r\nsports  event.   On  the Hindi Channel  as  is  happening  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia, I would ask MediaCorp to look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> I would like to ask for clarification on\r\n\r\nthe point of broadcast times of Channel NewsAsia between 6.30\r\n\r\nam and 9.30 am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> As far as broadcasting of the news\r\n\r\nin  Channel  5  as well as Channel NewsAsia is concerned,  we\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  this is not an easy  solution.   The  ideal\r\n\r\nsolution, and what I believe the Member would like  to  have,\r\n\r\nwould   be   to  see  the  two  channels  showing   different\r\n\r\nprogrammes, because Singaporeans wishing to watch news  could\r\n\r\njust  switch to Channel NewsAsia and switch to Channel 5  for\r\n\r\nsomething  different.   But the cost  of  producing  separate\r\n\r\nprogrammes is high and running different shows in the morning\r\n\r\nwhen  the  viewership  is low may cost financial  strains  on\r\n\r\nMediaCorp.   Nevertheless, I would still take Mr  Ravindran's\r\n\r\nsuggestion  and  hope  that  MediaCorp  would  look  into  it\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I do hope that MCS will have the\r\n\r\ncreative  juices to think how to make use of  this  broadcast\r\n\r\ntime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween 6.30 am and 9.30 am, because if they cannot even make\r\n\r\nuse  of  this  simple time-slot, I do not know how  they  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to compete when MediaWorks comes on the scene, because\r\n\r\nnaturally,  people will tend to move towards  MediaWorks.

These heritage  centres\r\n\r\nwould  certainly transmit the cultures, traditions and  sense\r\n\r\nof  history of the different communities in Singapore.   They\r\n\r\nalso  have  the  potential of attracting tourists  and  other\r\n\r\nvisitors.   I  would like to ask the Minister to  update  the\r\n\r\ndevelopments  on the Chinese and Malay Heritage  Centres.   I\r\n\r\nwould also like to know what steps the Ministry has taken  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  the Indian Heritage Centre and whether the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  taken  any pro-active steps to bring together interested\r\n\r\norganisations to move on with the projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, MITA's concerted efforts to\r\n\r\ncultivate  the arts are also evident in the preservation  and\r\n\r\npromotion  of  local  heritage.   Mr  Ravindran  asked  about\r\n\r\nGovernment's  support  for the Indian  Heritage  Centre.   In\r\n\r\n1992,  the  Government  agreed to the provision  of  suitable\r\n\r\npremises on nominal leases to the Chinese, Malay, Indian  and\r\n\r\nEurasian  communities for their respective community heritage\r\n\r\ncentres.  The Government has also agreed to the provision  of\r\n\r\none-off  matching grants for each heritage centre  to  enable\r\n\r\nthem  to set up endowment funds.  The grant will be a dollar-to-dollar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatching  basis  against funds raised by the communities  for\r\n\r\ntheir  respective endowment funds, subject to  a  cap  of  $5\r\n\r\nmillion,  $2  million, $1 million and $0.25 million  for  the\r\n\r\nChinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian communities respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome the efforts of each community to set up\r\n\r\ncentres  for  the promotion of their heritage.

MITA  would  thus\r\n\r\nencourage  the Indian community to set up an Indian  Heritage\r\n\r\nCentre  and  the National Heritage Board would  be  happy  to\r\n\r\nextend  its  support  and assistance in  setting  up  such  a\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $223,554,120 for Head R ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $188,232,200 for Head R ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
