But that cannot be so,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, for in line 32 of  the  clause,\r\n\r\nthe purposes for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nwhich  the  Comptroller may  exercise  his  powers\r\n\r\nunder this clause are categorically set out:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...for the purpose of ascertaining any facts\r\n\r\nor  inspecting any books and documents  which  the\r\n\r\nComptroller  considers necessary or  relevant  for\r\n\r\nthe purposes of this Ordinance...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore,  the Comptroller's entry is limited  to\r\n\r\nthe purposes enumerated in that particular clause.\r\n\r\nSo to say that that amendment makes it clearer,  I\r\n\r\nthink, Sir, is not right. If anything, it makes it\r\n\r\neasier and puts the Comptroller outside the  ambit\r\n\r\nof  the  Courts  by  introducing  that  particular\r\n\r\namendment.  I  myself see no point or  purpose  or\r\n\r\nusefulness in that amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If there is no other Member wishing\r\n\r\nto speak, I will put the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6, line 3, to leave out \"statutory\" and\r\n\r\ninsert \"legal\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment is to bring\r\n\r\nwithin  the  proviso a category  of  persons  who,\r\n\r\nunder  the  law - and by law I mean both the  common\r\n\r\nlaw  and the statute law - are precluded from giving\r\n\r\nany information to any person unless the person in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  whom the information is sought  gives\r\n\r\nhis express permission to that person. On that,  I\r\n\r\nwould   like   to  refer  to  the  advocates   and\r\n\r\nsolicitors practising in the Courts here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advocates and solicitors, Mr Speaker, Sir, are\r\n\r\nunder  a legal obligation not to disclose matters,\r\n\r\nwhich   have  been  disclosed  to  them  by  their\r\n\r\nclients, to outside persons or parties unless  the\r\n\r\nclients   themselves   expressly   authorise   the\r\n\r\nsolicitors  so  to  do. That is  covered  by  many\r\n\r\ncommon  law  decision cases. I am wondering,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is the intention of the Government  to\r\n\r\noverrule  the present position by the use  of  the\r\n\r\nword  \"statutory\" in this clause. If the intention\r\n\r\nof the Government is that the words \"statutory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobligation\"  should mean that a person  who  says\r\n\r\nthat  he  has  the benefit of this  proviso  must\r\n\r\npoint  to  a particular statute rather than  case\r\n\r\nlaw, then advocates and solicitors would lose the\r\n\r\nprivilege. If Government does not intend to  take\r\n\r\nit  that far, then this amendment would meet  the\r\n\r\ncase  by  preserving the privilege of an advocate\r\n\r\nand   solicitor  to  maintain  secrecy  regarding\r\n\r\nmatters  of  his client, unless his client  tells\r\n\r\nhim  otherwise.  In  any  case,  Sir,  since  the\r\n\r\nComptroller  would  know  who  the  advocate  and\r\n\r\nsolicitor was, he would also know who the  client\r\n\r\nwas.  Therefore, all that the Comptroller  would\r\n\r\nhave to do would be to get hold of the client and\r\n\r\nexercise  on  him the rights which the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nconfers on him, and through him, he could get  at\r\n\r\nthe advocate and solicitor concerned. It would  I\r\n\r\nthink  be in the best interests of the profession\r\n\r\nthat  that privilege should be protected, and  if\r\n\r\nthe Government feels that it should be so, I feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  amendment would meet the  case  rather\r\n\r\nthan the clause as it now stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, the point raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park  has been discussed  at  length\r\n\r\nduring  the  meeting between the  Governments  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation in Kuala Lumpur last\r\n\r\nmonth.  It was agreed between them that it  would\r\n\r\nbe   the   intention  of  this   Ordinance   that\r\n\r\nsolicitors  would  not  be  exempted   from   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this clause, and that only  persons\r\n\r\nunder  statutory obligation would be outside  its\r\n\r\nprovision. These would include officials such  as\r\n\r\nthe   Controller   of   Foreign   Exchange,   the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent  of  Census,  the   Registrar   of\r\n\r\nImports  and  Exports, and possibly a  few  other\r\n\r\nofficials.  It is felt that in this matter  there\r\n\r\nare   no   grounds  whatsoever   in   drawing   a\r\n\r\ndistinction   between   the   relationships    of\r\n\r\nsolicitors   and   their   clients   and    other\r\n\r\nprofessional persons and their clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

He  praised lawyers of sufficient  merit\r\n\r\nwho  were able to advise clients on the best  way\r\n\r\nof  avoiding these tax laws. I do not see why  he\r\n\r\nmust  be afraid of that now when he said that  he\r\n\r\nhas  been able to advise his clients on the  best\r\n\r\nway  of avoiding the tax laws. He should be  just\r\n\r\nas  prepared  to co-operate with the  Comptroller\r\n\r\nand  explain  to him how these tax  laws  can  be\r\n\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the avoidance of income tax is a\r\n\r\nhighly  skilled art, particularly  when  we  have\r\n\r\nsuch  an efficient Comptroller of Income Tax  and\r\n\r\nan  efficient Minister for Finance. However, Sir,\r\n\r\nI will not go into that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Law has said that so\r\n\r\nfar  as  the solicitors are concerned it  is  not\r\n\r\nagainst  their interests to disclose  what  their\r\n\r\nclients  have told them. But it has been the  law\r\n\r\nthat  anything said to a solicitor in  confidence\r\n\r\nmust   be  respected  by  the  lawyer.  But   any\r\n\r\nstatement  made to a clergyman or a doctor  or  a\r\n\r\ndentist  or any other professional man has  never\r\n\r\nbeen protected in a Court of law. The lawyer  has\r\n\r\nalways  been  in  a privileged  position.  I  was\r\n\r\nwondering whether to get at the tax evaders it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to take away that privilege which  the\r\n\r\nCourts of law have thought fit to confer upon the\r\n\r\nlegal profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am sure that the legal\r\n\r\nprofession would welcome the provision of the law\r\n\r\nas   it  stands,  since  this  will  add  to  the\r\n\r\nsafeguard   against   any   approach   by   shady\r\n\r\ncharacters   for   assistance  from   the   legal\r\n\r\nprofession  either to evade or  to  avoid  income\r\n\r\ntax. I take it that the Member for Farrer Park is\r\n\r\nnot  against  the  principle of  the  Comptroller\r\n\r\nhaving  access  to information in  the  hands  of\r\n\r\nsolicitors,   since  he  has  put   forward   the\r\n\r\nsuggestion that this could quite easily  be  done\r\n\r\nby direct application of pressure on the taxpayer\r\n\r\nhimself. But the main\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason is that there are no grounds whatsoever for\r\n\r\ndistinguishing between, let us say, solicitors and\r\n\r\naccountants  in this particular field.  Both  deal\r\n\r\nwith   tax  matters,  and  if  we  were  to  grant\r\n\r\nprivilege  to  one and not to the other,  then  we\r\n\r\nmight well be accused of discriminatory treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the discriminatory treatment is\r\n\r\nalready  here,  having  been  conferred   on   the\r\n\r\nsolicitor  by the Courts of Law, for reasons  best\r\n\r\nknown to them. But if the Comptroller thinks  that\r\n\r\nthat  should be taken away and that it is  in  the\r\n\r\nbest interests of the State that it should happen,\r\n\r\nwell, it is for the Legislature to say so and  for\r\n\r\nthe Government in power to say so. And I dare say,\r\n\r\nSir,  when  this Bill is passed and  becomes  law,\r\n\r\ncertainly the legal profession will comply with it\r\n\r\nin  the  best  way they can. But as matters  stand\r\n\r\nnow,  they  have this protection and they  are  in\r\n\r\nduty  bound  to  their  clients  not  to  disclose\r\n\r\ninformation. If they did disclose it,  they  would\r\n\r\nbe  liable  in damages to their clients.  That  is\r\n\r\nalso a provision of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, on the question of tax avoidance, we\r\n\r\nhave  heard a number of times about how solicitors\r\n\r\nencourage tax avoidance. Mr Speaker, Sir, they do\r\n\r\nnot  encourage  tax avoidance. They  advise  their\r\n\r\nclients  in tax avoidance. May I put a case  in  a\r\n\r\nsimple  form so that even the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nmight  understand it? Supposing there was a bridge\r\n\r\nand  the  Government  was charging  every  vehicle\r\n\r\nusing that bridge a toll tax of a dollar. That  is\r\n\r\na tax which goes to the Exchequer Fund and it will\r\n\r\nbe  used  for purposes of the State. If  I,  as  a\r\n\r\nmotorist,  avoided  the  bridge  and  went  to  my\r\n\r\ndestination  in  a roundabout way,  was  I  acting\r\n\r\ncontrary to the interests of the State?

It will become  statute  law\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara has assented  to\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am suggesting to the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nthat, as a result of these amendments, there is in\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance a hiatus. The present  position  is\r\n\r\nthat   where   the  Comptroller  has  raised   his\r\n\r\nassessment   for  the  year  of  assessment,   the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer has to pay the tax within 30 days of  the\r\n\r\nassessment.  If he does not wish to  pay  the  tax\r\n\r\nwithin  30 days as set out in the Ordinance,  then\r\n\r\nhe  must file a notice of objection. On the notice\r\n\r\nof  objection, if the Comptroller and the taxpayer\r\n\r\ncome  to  an  agreement, there  will  then  be  an\r\n\r\namendment to the tax, and the amended tax will  be\r\n\r\npaid  to  the  Comptroller. But if the Comptroller\r\n\r\nand  the  taxpayer,  on the notice  of  objection,\r\n\r\ncannot  come  to  an agreement and - these  are  the\r\n\r\noperative   words,   Mr   Speaker,   Sir - if   the\r\n\r\nComptroller so signifies to the taxpayer  that  he\r\n\r\ncannot agree with the taxpayer, then and only then\r\n\r\nwill  the  right of appeal, so far as the taxpayer\r\n\r\nis  concerned,  arise.  On notification  from  the\r\n\r\nComptroller   that  he  cannot  agree   with   the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer,   then  within  seven   days   of   such\r\n\r\nnotification, a notice of appeal must be filed and\r\n\r\nthe  matter  then  goes to  appeal.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nposition under the existing law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will be the position after these amendments\r\n\r\nhave  been passed? The position will be  that,  as\r\n\r\nsoon as the Comptroller raises his assessment, the\r\n\r\ntax  must  be paid within 30 days. The  taxpayer's\r\n\r\nright  of  appeal will only arise if  he  files  a\r\n\r\nnotice of objection within 30 days and, mark these\r\n\r\nwords,   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  if  the  Comptroller\r\n\r\nsignifies  to  the  taxpayer that  he  is  not  in\r\n\r\nagreement  with  his objection.  So  that  if  the\r\n\r\nComptroller, under the new law,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkeeps  quiet  about the notice of  objection,  the\r\n\r\nright of appeal does not arise. In this case,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can have the cake and eat  it  too.  I\r\n\r\nknow  of  cases, Mr Speaker, Sir - and  here  I  am\r\n\r\nprepared  to  give  facts  and  figures   to   the\r\n\r\nMinister,  if  he  wishes me to, in  writing   - now\r\n\r\npending  before the Comptroller where notices  of\r\n\r\nobjection  have been given, but no  agreement  has\r\n\r\nyet  been reached between the Comptroller and  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer,  with  the result that  no  appeals  can\r\n\r\narise.  That position now is all right so  far  as\r\n\r\nthe  taxpayer is concerned, because tax also  need\r\n\r\nnot  be  paid. But when the position is  that  tax\r\n\r\nmust be paid within 30 days, you can imagine,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, what hardship can be caused  to  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a hypothetical case - this is not\r\n\r\nunusual - where notice of objection has  been  given\r\n\r\nbut  agreement  has not been reached  between  the\r\n\r\nComptroller and the taxpayer, and no intimation to\r\n\r\nthat effect, in writing, has been passed on to the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer.   Two   years  elapse   and   then   the\r\n\r\nComptroller  says,  \"I  do  not  agree   to   your\r\n\r\nobjections.\"  The right of appeal then  arises.  A\r\n\r\nnotice  of appeal is filed, and another two  years\r\n\r\nis  taken  before the appeal is heard - I  was  told\r\n\r\nthat that is the normal length of time. So four to\r\n\r\nfive  years could elapse, Mr Speaker, Sir, before\r\n\r\nthe  taxpayer  could  have  his  case  heard.  The\r\n\r\nFinance Minister is laughing, but it could  happen\r\n\r\nbecause  he himself has told the House  that  from\r\n\r\nthe  time of objection to now - two to three  years - \r\n\r\nnothing  has been done by the Board. I am  telling\r\n\r\nthe  Minister that two to three years have  passed\r\n\r\nin  the  Office of the Comptroller and he has  not\r\n\r\nsignified his dissent to the taxpayer. I think two\r\n\r\nand  three  makes  five - I  believe  that  is  good\r\n\r\nfinance, too. So the Government says, \"Pay the tax\r\n\r\nwithin  30  days,  but the determination  of  your\r\n\r\nrights must wait for another five years.\" I do not\r\n\r\nthink any decent Government, however anxious it is\r\n\r\nto collect tax, would leave the taxpayer in such a\r\n\r\nposition.  I  do  not  know whether  it  would  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  amend  the Ordinance  to  secure  a\r\n\r\nstatutory right on the part of the taxpayer to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncall the Comptroller to give his decision within a\r\n\r\nstated  period. But perhaps the Minister  himself,\r\n\r\nunder the new section 3A, might now be able to  do\r\n\r\nit   by   giving  a  general  direction   to   the\r\n\r\nComptroller that in such matters he must say \"yea\"\r\n\r\nor  \"nay\" within 30 days. I hope that one  of  the\r\n\r\nmore  pleasanter duties of the Minister,  when  he\r\n\r\ngets  his power under the new section 3A, will  be\r\n\r\nto issue a general direction to the Comptroller to\r\n\r\nthe  effect that in future he shall say  \"yea\"  or\r\n\r\n\"nay\" within 30 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park has brought up very clearly  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  it has been necessary to bring  about\r\n\r\nthe  amendments  that  we  are  seeking  from  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.   He  has  given  instances  of   delays\r\n\r\nresulting  from  the lodging of an  appeal  or  an\r\n\r\nobjection against an assessment. It is because the\r\n\r\npresent  Ordinance  makes  it  so  attractive  for\r\n\r\ntaxpayers to lodge an objection that we have  such\r\n\r\na large number of objections raised that it is not\r\n\r\npossible,  within the resources of the Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment, to deal with them expeditiously.  This\r\n\r\nhas  a cumulative effect in that the moment people\r\n\r\nknow  that  there  will  be  delays  in  giving  a\r\n\r\ndecision  on this from the Comptroller,  there  is\r\n\r\nall  the  more an incentive to lodge an  objection\r\n\r\nuntil we get to the ridiculous stage where it  may\r\n\r\ntake four to five years to bring about finality in\r\n\r\nthese matters.

The  point  I\r\n\r\nwish  to emphasise here is not the number of  Bills\r\n\r\nwhich  have been tabled by the P.A.P. To a  certain\r\n\r\nextent, Bills introduced by the P.A.P. reflect  the\r\n\r\nconditions  prevailing in Singapore at the  present\r\n\r\ntime,  and  the  conditions  which  the  Government\r\n\r\nintends to achieve in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing is clear. That is that every action\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the People's Action Party Government  in\r\n\r\nthe  field of legislation has been made  not  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of any pressure, nor as concessions to  any\r\n\r\ndemand by any particular group. In fact, we of the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party can take pride in  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  every  measure taken by us in the  political,\r\n\r\neconomic and even social field has originated  from\r\n\r\nour  own plans and considerations and taken on  our\r\n\r\nown  initiative. It is not necessary for me to give\r\n\r\ndetails  of the steps already taken by us  for  the\r\n\r\nimprovement of the living conditions of the  people\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our own initiative, it is enough for me to\r\n\r\nintroduce   this  National  Language  and   Culture\r\n\r\nInstitute Bill at its Second Reading today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if the Government wishes to develop and popularise our national language, and promote\r\n\r\nthe  evolution of a Malayan culture as a  permanent\r\n\r\nmeasure   and  a  long-term  policy,   it   becomes\r\n\r\nessential to set up a National Language and Culture\r\n\r\nInstitute  for  the purpose of directing,  and  co-ordinating all work in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Institute of National Language and\r\n\r\nCulture  has two aspects, that is to say,  language\r\n\r\nand   culture.  We  have  decided  to  set  up  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  with these two main objectives,  because\r\n\r\nwe  believe that the problem of achieving  national\r\n\r\nunity  is  equal  in importance to the  problem  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the  national  language  and   national\r\n\r\nculture.  Efforts which aim merely at  popularising\r\n\r\nthe  use of Malay as the national language will not\r\n\r\nbe  enough.  It  is essential to  make  efforts  to\r\n\r\nencourage  mutual  understanding  in  the   various\r\n\r\naspects  of  the  cultures of  the  races  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  as the first step to infuse the spirit  of\r\n\r\nunity.  Through such efforts, it is  hoped  that  a\r\n\r\nbasis  for  the  eventual synthesis  of  a  Malayan\r\n\r\nculture will be laid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the first aspect, i.e. language,\r\n\r\nthe  immediate task before us is to popularise  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  the national language among the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, the majority of whom are non-Malays. The\r\n\r\nobject  of this task is to educate the majority  of\r\n\r\nthe people in the national language during the next\r\n\r\nfour years. Non-Malays in Singapore who do not have\r\n\r\na  sound  knowledge  of  Ma-lay  number  about  one\r\n\r\nmillion  persons. It is clear that the  problem  of\r\n\r\npopularising the use of the national language among\r\n\r\nthese  people is a tremendous one. The  role  which\r\n\r\nthe  Institute  will  play  in  solving  this  huge\r\n\r\nproblem is only a part of the overall solution. The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  will  also  share  in  the\r\n\r\nsolution  of  this problem. The Institute  will  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  producing books on  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage,   text-books  and  books  on methods   of\r\n\r\nteaching  the  national language to  non-Malays  of\r\n\r\nvarious   races  and  cultures.  The  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  will,  of course, produce  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to that, the Institute will publish\r\n\r\nmagazines  in  the national language which  can  be\r\n\r\neasily  understood by people of various age groups.\r\n\r\nIt is also necessary to produce radio programmes in\r\n\r\nthe   national  language  which  can   be   easily\r\n\r\nunderstood  by  listeners of all  races.

School\r\n\r\ntext-books in the national language, and books  on\r\n\r\nMalayan  subjects  for our schools  will  also  be\r\n\r\npublished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In carrying out the aforesaid tasks of the\r\n\r\nInstitute,  it  must  be borne  in  mind  that  we\r\n\r\nearnestly  desire to co-operate  with  the  Malay-Indonesian  Language  Co-ordination  Committee  by\r\n\r\nimplementing  decisions on  spelling,  terminology\r\n\r\nand  other matters relating to the standardisation\r\n\r\nof Bahasa Melayu and bahasa Indonesia, agreed upon\r\n\r\nby  Malaya  and Indonesia. Our Language  Institute\r\n\r\nwill try to establish relations and cooperate with\r\n\r\norganisations  which have similar objectives  such\r\n\r\nas  the  Language  and Literature  Agency  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation   of   Malaya,   and   the   Indonesian\r\n\r\nLiterature Institute, so that duplication  in  the\r\n\r\ntranslation of books, etc., for instance,  can  be\r\n\r\navoided,   and  in  general  to  carry   out   the\r\n\r\nobjectives  of the Institute. We will regard  such\r\n\r\norganisations  as being our elders and  possessing\r\n\r\nmore experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultural aspect of the work of the Institute\r\n\r\nis  no  more and no less important than  its  role\r\n\r\nconcerning language. The Institute will  encourage\r\n\r\nresearch  in  all aspects of cultures existing  in\r\n\r\none country, so that the people can understand the\r\n\r\nmatter    more    deeply.   This   will    include\r\n\r\nsociological,  political  and  art  research.  For\r\n\r\nexample, research on the Malay opera or the Peking\r\n\r\nopera  has never been carried out before. It  will\r\n\r\nbe  useful  if  research is  carried  out  on  the\r\n\r\nbackground of these two types of operas  in  order\r\n\r\nto  find out whether their feudalistic backgrounds\r\n\r\nshould  be restored or revived, or whether  a  new\r\n\r\ntype of Malayan drama should be created to replace\r\n\r\nboth types of opera in the national language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Members of this Assembly have surely\r\n\r\nnoted  that,  among  other  things,  our  Language\r\n\r\nInstitute   aims  at  encouraging  and,   wherever\r\n\r\nnecessary,  providing  facilities  for   promoting\r\n\r\nMalayan  fine arts. Such objectives are  based  on\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that culture is a thing that lives  and\r\n\r\ngrows.  Members of this Assembly who  are  present\r\n\r\nhere will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagree  with me that, in the field of culture,  the\r\n\r\narts  can  only  live  and  grow  well  if  it  is\r\n\r\nnourished by healthy and progressive art creations\r\n\r\nwhich  are  consistent with changing  times.  Even\r\n\r\nthough  some  of our arts contain  traces  of  the\r\n\r\ninfluences  of  the past, yet not all  these  past\r\n\r\nelements should be eradicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to draw the attention of this Assembly to one of the objectives of our\r\n\r\nLanguage  Institute,  namely,  to  encourage   and\r\n\r\npromote  literary talent in the national  language\r\n\r\nand  other languages used in this country with the\r\n\r\naims  of fostering the growth of a Malayan culture\r\n\r\nand  Malayan  consciousness. In this  transitional\r\n\r\nperiod of our educational system, it will be found\r\n\r\nthat  there are many among the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwho  are  gifted with literary talent.  But  their\r\n\r\ntalent  can  be brought to light only through  the\r\n\r\nlanguage in which they have been taught,  such  as\r\n\r\nChinese,   Tamil  and  English,  apart  from   the\r\n\r\nnational   language.   It  would   therefore   be\r\n\r\nreasonable and realistic for us not to allow  this\r\n\r\nto  be wasted. It is better to allow them to write\r\n\r\nshort  stories, drama and plays with  a  Malaysian\r\n\r\ntheme  and background than to allow them  to  rely\r\n\r\nonly on books and perform plays and drama imported\r\n\r\nfrom  China, London, Taiwan or Madras. As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid earlier in regard to the growth of a culture,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  nourished by healthy  elements,  it  is\r\n\r\nlikewise  the same in the case of arts, literature\r\n\r\nand drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the establishment of the National Language and Culture Institute is based on the\r\n\r\nneed  for  such a department that can  tackle  and\r\n\r\nsolve  various problems connected with our  common\r\n\r\naim  to  make Malay the national language of  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  Owing  to  the acute shortage  of  Malay\r\n\r\nteachers in Singapore, it is necessary for the  Ministry  of  Education to provide  courses  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  language  for non-Malay  teachers.  This\r\n\r\nshortage of Malay language teachers is likewise  a\r\n\r\nproblem  for this new department which we wish  to\r\n\r\nset  up, in so far as our Language Institute  will\r\n\r\nface  the  problem  of  producing  books  in   the\r\n\r\nnational language and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  text-books for the non-Malay  teachers  who\r\n\r\nwill  teach the Malay language to non-Malays. This\r\n\r\nis indeed an extraordinary situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I wish to mention is the role\r\n\r\nof  the National Language and Culture Institute in\r\n\r\nthe  adult education campaign which the Government\r\n\r\nis  planning to intensify. Our Language  Institute\r\n\r\nmust  play an important role in achieving the aims\r\n\r\nof the Adult Education Board in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on behalf of U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nparticularly,  I  say  thanks  to  God   Almighty.\r\n\r\nNeither  will I forget to offer my congratulations\r\n\r\nto    the   Government   which   has   shown   its\r\n\r\ndetermination  not  only to raise,  encourage  and\r\n\r\ndevelop the Malay language, but also to solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem of nationality for all our citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, once again I pay tribute to the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the People's Action Party. During  the\r\n\r\nFirst Session of this Assembly, the speech made by\r\n\r\nthe  first  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  of  a  self-\r\n\r\ngoverning  Singapore was made in  Malay.  But  the\r\n\r\nthen Yang di-Pertuan Negara is not an Asian. He is\r\n\r\nan  Englishman.  From before the colonialists  had\r\n\r\nencouraged Government servants especially to study\r\n\r\nthe   Malay   language.   Similarly,   they   also\r\n\r\nencouraged  those  people who were  interested  in\r\n\r\nlearning that language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What impresses me in the speech by the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCulture was his remark that political history will\r\n\r\nalso  play its part in culture. Mr Speaker, as  a\r\n\r\nMember of the Opposition, I need clarification  as\r\n\r\nto  what  political  history we  should  tell  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, because if we are to extract\r\n\r\nthis  only from the history of the Malays, it will\r\n\r\nbe  communalistic. As I am still in  the  dark,  I\r\n\r\nthink it should be clarified in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, I have noted this\r\n\r\nfact - the people of Indonesia and the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  who  are  our neighbours,  have  achieved\r\n\r\nindependence. I am proud of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the question of culture, which should\r\n\r\nbe   encouraged,  we  have  seen  the   Indonesian\r\n\r\nbadminton  team whose members are the  Ra'ayat  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  They are not of Malay origin,  because\r\n\r\nall  of  them wear caps. Likewise, representatives\r\n\r\nof  the Federation of Malaya who go abroad put  on\r\n\r\nsongkoks or caps. Could I have an explanation from\r\n\r\nthe  Government whether, in culture, we should put\r\n\r\non   caps   to   show  that  we  are  representing\r\n\r\nSingapore,  which will be achieving  independence?\r\n\r\nThis is merely a question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, I do not know what\r\n\r\nto  talk about. Looking at the Opposition,  I  see\r\n\r\nthat  the Member for Mountbatten is wearing sarong\r\n\r\nkebaya  and  a  shawl. Will this be  part  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem of culture in so far as national dress  is\r\n\r\nconcerned? What would be the style of our national\r\n\r\ndress? Are we going to wear white shirts and  long\r\n\r\ntrousers  like  the Government side  or  like  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members, including myself, who  merely\r\n\r\nput  on  caps?  I  feel that this  too  should  be\r\n\r\nclarified,   if  it  is  the  intention   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to get support from the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to all this, Mr Speaker, nearly one\r\n\r\nyear  has  elapsed since this Assembly  came  into\r\n\r\nsession. I hear with great regret that Mr Speaker\r\n\r\nwill be resigning from office. But what to do? Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker will be succeeded by another Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period of one year, Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nwish  to offer my highest congratulations  to  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  who has, on  several  occasions,\r\n\r\nused  the  national language in this Assembly.  It\r\n\r\ncould  be said that the language used by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has been of a high standard. But what has\r\n\r\nbecome  a question mark to me is that, aside  from\r\n\r\nthe  Malay Members sitting on the Government side,\r\n\r\nonly one Member has made his speech in Malay. So I\r\n\r\nhope that the Government should, as an example  to\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore encourage the use of Malay\r\n\r\nright  inside  this Assembly House if  we  are  to\r\n\r\nmerge with the Federation of Malaya. We know  what\r\n\r\nlanguage is used there. In their Senate the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficial  language  is  Malay.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I also hope that Opposition Members, like\r\n\r\nthe  Members for Cairnhill and Farrer Park,  will,\r\n\r\nif possible, speak in the national language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would also like to say something about culture. I would like to know whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in order to create a culture,  wishes\r\n\r\nto  make Malay culture as a basis? It is merely  a\r\n\r\nquestion which I pose to the Government, because I\r\n\r\nwish  to know further how the Government is  going\r\n\r\nto  implement the aim of creating one  culture.  I\r\n\r\nhave  given  considerable thought to this  matter.\r\n\r\nThe  Malays  cannot easily be persuaded  to  leave\r\n\r\ntheir  traditional culture. But we  must  remember\r\n\r\nthat our fellow citizens in Singapore are made  up\r\n\r\nof  various races who have shown their loyalty  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  know from history that  there  are\r\n\r\npeople  who have had their own culture generations\r\n\r\nago, and their culture is very much older than our\r\n\r\nMalay  culture. Are they prepared to discard their\r\n\r\nown  culture? Or will it be a hotch-potch of  this\r\n\r\nand  that  culture of those people  who  have  now\r\n\r\nbecome   citizens  of  Singapore?   I   hope   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will enlighten me on this matter so  as\r\n\r\nto enable us to go further into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Malays have ronggeng or\r\n\r\njoget  which  is  also part of their  culture.  At\r\n\r\nwedding feasts joget is performed to entertain the\r\n\r\nguests.  In  the changing times that  we  are  now\r\n\r\nfacing, Malays as well as non-Malays like dancing.\r\n\r\nThe  colonialists brought their own culture to our\r\n\r\nland.  Likewise  the  people  of  other  countries\r\n\r\nbrought  culture  similar  to  the  one   I   have\r\n\r\nmentioned just now. I would like to have a  fuller\r\n\r\nexplanation on such matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point I would like to bring up\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly. In the matter  of  culture,  I\r\n\r\nwould also like to refer to our national language.\r\n\r\nWhen are we going to use our national language  on\r\n\r\nnotices,  notice-boards, etc.? The  names  of  the\r\n\r\nroads  should also be in Malay. Are  we  going  to\r\n\r\npermit  matters to remain as they  are  today?  We\r\n\r\nmust  take positive steps now to bring the  people\r\n\r\ntogether. We must eradicate all imported  elements\r\n\r\nfrom  our  culture.  All notices,  advertisements,\r\n\r\netc, should be printed in Malay. In this way,  we\r\n\r\ncan show to the people of the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nthat Singapore is taking positive steps to promote\r\n\r\nthe  use of the Malay language. With such a  claim\r\n\r\nto  our credit, I feel that the possibility  of  a\r\n\r\nmerger  with the Federation of Malaya will not  be\r\n\r\nso  remote. In whatever we do, we must be sincere.\r\n\r\nWe must not do things half-heartedly because we do\r\n\r\nnot wish people to level the criticism that things\r\n\r\nare done half-heartedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you may recall how, during the\r\n\r\nJapanese occupation period, the Japanese tried  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  their  own  culture  in  the   occupied\r\n\r\ncountries. But the method by which they  tried  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this was by force. We know  that  such  a\r\n\r\nmethod  would  be  resisted  by  people  who  love\r\n\r\nindependence, unity and prosperity. They would  be\r\n\r\nprepared to fight to the death on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Government will clarify,\r\n\r\nparticularly  to U.M.N.O., the nature  of  Malayan\r\n\r\nculture  in  Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  also\r\n\r\nhope,  with respect to you, that you will be  able\r\n\r\nto  conduct  proceedings in this Assembly  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  language  so  that  you  will  not  say,\r\n\r\n\"Order, order\" in English but in Malay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Leong Keng Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   we   have   just   heard    the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCulture say that the National Language and Culture\r\n\r\nInstitute  will concentrate on the  study  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay  language  and promote  the  mixing  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  cultures.

We  know that in the past the  colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment tried to divide the people because  of\r\n\r\nits  multi-racial society. In the past, there was\r\n\r\nno   inter-relation   and  co-operation   between\r\n\r\nschools  of  the four different language  groups.\r\n\r\nThe  non-English  schools were suppressed.  Since\r\n\r\nthe  new  Government came into power,  Malay  has\r\n\r\nbecome   the  national  language.  The   National\r\n\r\nLanguage   and   Culture   Institute   will    be\r\n\r\nestablished  for the development of the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage  so  that more people will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nexpress their views in Malay. That is what we aim\r\n\r\nto  do.  In  the schools, the study of the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  has been introduced. The Malay language\r\n\r\nshould be the same as that of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  Indonesia. We have already  sent  a\r\n\r\ndelegation to Indonesia to study the problems of\r\n\r\neducation  there. The textbooks of Indonesia  can\r\n\r\nbe  used by us to nourish the Malayan culture.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  in future Singapore  will  send  a\r\n\r\ndelegation to the Federation of Malaya  to  study\r\n\r\nMalayan culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote the development of the Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage,  we must engage in various  activities.\r\n\r\nWe  must  encourage the teachers to make  use  of\r\n\r\nMalayan history and background in their writings,\r\n\r\nso   that  the  next  generation  of  people   in\r\n\r\nSingapore will have a clearer picture of  Malayan\r\n\r\nculture.  In  the  past, the  textbooks  used  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  schools came from England,  the  Chinese\r\n\r\ntextbooks  came from China or Hongkong,  and  the\r\n\r\nIndian  textbooks  came from  India.  Only  Malay\r\n\r\ntextbooks  were produced locally but  no  serious\r\n\r\neffort  has been made to improve the standard  of\r\n\r\nthese books with the result that there are only a\r\n\r\nfew  Malay  textbooks.  I hope  in  future  Malay\r\n\r\ntextbooks will be produced by the Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the training of Malay teachers,\r\n\r\nwe  have  trained  many  teachers  to  teach  the\r\n\r\nnational language to students in schools.

The  national  language - which   is\r\n\r\nMalay - is a national issue, which should have  the\r\n\r\nsupport   of   all   sections  of   the   people,\r\n\r\nirrespective of their party leanings, and of  the\r\n\r\nfact that generations of them have lived here, as\r\n\r\nlong  as  they owe their allegiance to Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Federation  of Malaya  there  exists  an\r\n\r\ninstitute  called  the  Language  and  Literature\r\n\r\nInstitute.

Apart from carrying out research, I  am\r\n\r\nconfident,  Mr  Speaker, we know that  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  has been in existence for a good  number\r\n\r\nof years. It is hoped that with the cooperation of\r\n\r\nall  concerned in this Island, regardless of their\r\n\r\nparty  leanings, we will achieve our determination\r\n\r\nto enrich and develop the Malay language and study\r\n\r\nand know the Malay language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of culture, Mr Speaker, we are\r\n\r\ntrying to build our national culture from whatever\r\n\r\ncultural  sources  are  available.  I  think   our\r\n\r\nculture  is  still  at a stage where  research  is\r\n\r\nbeing  carried out, because the officials  of  the\r\n\r\nDewan  will  carry out research into our  national\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nshould  like to clarify that Government has opened\r\n\r\nthe  way  towards one language which will be  used\r\n\r\nand which will be spoken by people of all races in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  For  the  purpose  of  achieving  this\r\n\r\nobjective,  the support of the Opposition  Members\r\n\r\nwill be welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  of  the  opinion  that  the  National\r\n\r\nLanguage  and  Culture Institute is  a  necessity.\r\n\r\nSince  the P.A.P. Government introduced the slogan\r\n\r\nthat  Malay is the national language, the majority\r\n\r\nof  the Chinese people in Singapore have not  only\r\n\r\naccepted it but are also taking positive steps  to\r\n\r\nlearn  the language. No matter where they  are - in\r\n\r\nthe   trade  unions,  Nanyang  University,   rural\r\n\r\norganisations, all the branches of the P.A.P., and\r\n\r\nin  various  commercial  organisations - many  Malay\r\n\r\nclasses  have been set up. I can put  it  in  this\r\n\r\nway - the majority of the Chinese workers, the young\r\n\r\nstudents  and the intellectuals, sincerely  accept\r\n\r\nMalay  as  the national language. They  are  aware\r\n\r\nthat   if  they  can  directly  communicate  their\r\n\r\nfeelings   and  their  thoughts  to  their   Malay\r\n\r\nbrothers,  then  the Malays' fear of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nwill  be  eradicated. The Malays will then realise\r\n\r\nthat the so-called Chinese chauvinism is not as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserious  as  that  considered by  the  non-Chinese\r\n\r\neducated  people.  It can be said  that  the  non-Chinese  educated young people regard the learning\r\n\r\nof  the Malay language as more important than  the\r\n\r\nstudy of the English language. This is not because\r\n\r\nthe  study  of Malay is easier than the  study  of\r\n\r\nEnglish,  but that they are aware that  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  is the most important means of achieving\r\n\r\nnational unity in Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan made some comments on Malayan culture. I\r\n\r\nventure  to take this opportunity to say something\r\n\r\nso   that  everybody  will  understand  what   the\r\n\r\nattitude  of the Chinese youth is towards  Malayan\r\n\r\nculture.  Throughout the year the  campaign  among\r\n\r\nthe  majority of the Chinese youth to learn  Malay\r\n\r\nhas created a certain psychological change. In the\r\n\r\npast  many  Chinese  educated youths,  because  of\r\n\r\ntheir lack of understanding of the Malay language,\r\n\r\nlooked  down on the Malays. But this attitude  has\r\n\r\nchanged now. Since we have declared Malay  as  the\r\n\r\nnational language, their attitude has changed, and\r\n\r\nthey now accept Malay as the national language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many articles translated from Malay\r\n\r\ninto  Chinese appearing in the Chinese newspapers.\r\n\r\nIn  these newspapers, we can read a lot of  essays\r\n\r\nabout  the history of Malay literature.  This  is\r\n\r\nproof  of  the change of attitude of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nyouths  towards Malay literature. We can see  from\r\n\r\nthe  many  articles that the Chinese  youths  have\r\n\r\nbeen able to translate into Malay, essays on trees\r\n\r\nand  plants, and there is the Chinese  version  of\r\n\r\nSejarah  Melayu or Malai Chi Nien.  The  works  of\r\n\r\nUngku  Aziz are welcome and are earnestly  studied\r\n\r\nby  the  Chinese youths. Today the Chinese readers\r\n\r\nlearn more and more of Malay works. From the Malay\r\n\r\nTribune  run  by the Nanyang University,  we  also\r\n\r\nread articles published by the Utusan Melayu.  The\r\n\r\ntranslation  is made by Mustapha. From  all  these\r\n\r\ntranslated articles, the Chinese youths,  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time,  learn that there are  many  literary\r\n\r\nworkers  who  work  very hard  and  who  have  the\r\n\r\ncorrect mentality and consciousness in this field,\r\n\r\nespecially when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  learn  about the transitional  changes.  And\r\n\r\nwhen  these Chinese youths learn Malay literature,\r\n\r\nthey   deeply  respect  the  Malay  writers.  They\r\n\r\ndiscover that in the history of Malaya there  were\r\n\r\ncertain  people like the Chinese Wun  Tiang  Siang\r\n\r\nand  Yeok  Fay.  There were also people  who  were\r\n\r\nresourceful  and  brave, for example,  Hang  Tuah.\r\n\r\nThese  Chinese youths have as great a respect  for\r\n\r\nHang  Tuah  as they have for Wun Tiang  Siang  and\r\n\r\nYeok  Fay. All these translated versions  and  all\r\n\r\nthese  essays  appear in the newspaper,  but  they\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  done  under a good  organisation.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is clear that a certain  amount  of\r\n\r\neffort has been wasted by the Chinese youths. They\r\n\r\nnot only decide to learn more about the living conditions  of  the  Malay  people  and  their   past\r\n\r\nhistory, but they also try to pass on to the Malay\r\n\r\npeople their own feelings and their points of view\r\n\r\nin  this  respect. We can see for  ourselves  that\r\n\r\nthere is a certain newspaper which is being run by\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang University. Another publication,  the\r\n\r\nKesusasteraan  Kebudayaan,  is  also  run  by  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University.  The  running  of  these  two\r\n\r\npublications is to encourage the Chinese people to\r\n\r\nunderstand the Malay people, and also to encourage\r\n\r\nthem  to  translate Malay literary works  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the non-Malay people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if instead of trying to\r\n\r\nunderstand Malay culture in a purely formal way we\r\n\r\ntry  to  understand it from the way which  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  just now, that is, by showing  as  much\r\n\r\nrespect  for  the  past Malay  heroes  as  for the\r\n\r\nChinese heroes, then we can achieve national unity\r\n\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, there are many people who are\r\n\r\nlearning Malay. But some of them have stopped half-way.  One  of the most important reasons which  is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  this  failure  is  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nsuitable  textbooks for beginners. At present,  we\r\n\r\nhave such textbooks like Sinar Baru,, which is for\r\n\r\nbeginners. Our adult readers are people  who  have\r\n\r\nmuch    experience,   and   they   are    somewhat\r\n\r\nsophisticated.  A  textbook like  Sinar  Baru,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  cannot satisfy their needs  and  desires.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the supply of books\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis not adequate. Another reason for the failure is\r\n\r\nthe lack of a good Chinese! Malay dictionary. When\r\n\r\nthis  National Language and Culture  Institute  is\r\n\r\nset  up,  we can then carry out the task, which  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned  just  now under  a  well-directed\r\n\r\norganisation. We will no longer waste our time and\r\n\r\nenergies  as we have done in the past.  After  the\r\n\r\nsetting-up  of  this Dewan Bahasa  dan  Kebudayaan\r\n\r\nKebangsaan,  we  will bring a new  climax  to  our\r\n\r\ncampaign for the encouragement of the learning  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malay language. In addition, it will make  an\r\n\r\nunlimited contribution to our national unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I fully support the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a National Language  and  Culture\r\n\r\nInstitute,  for which the Bill has been introduced\r\n\r\ntoday  by  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture. The decision to  establish\r\n\r\nthis  National Language and Culture Institute  was\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Language Congress and the All-Malaya\r\n\r\nLanguage  and Literary Congress more than  a  year\r\n\r\nago,  although  at  the meeting  of  the  Congress\r\n\r\nreferred to, members from the Party which form the\r\n\r\nGovernment  today  were not represented.  Yet  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party Government is always  paying\r\n\r\nattention to the welfare of the people, especially\r\n\r\nin  the sphere of language and literature, and  it\r\n\r\nis  doing something which had been resolved by the\r\n\r\nMalay  Language  Congress, an  organisation  which\r\n\r\nrepresented    all   the   language   institutions\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  land.  The  setting  up  of   the\r\n\r\nNational  Language and Culture Institute  had  its\r\n\r\norigin at a meeting of the Malay Language Congress\r\n\r\nwhen  a resolution was adopted. As far as I  know,\r\n\r\nat  the  opening  of the All-Malaya  Language  and\r\n\r\nLiterary  Congress, Singapore was  represented  by\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government. The Singapore Government\r\n\r\nwas   represented  by  its  junior  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation.  He made a fiery speech, and  gave  an\r\n\r\nassurance  that  the resolution  of  the  Congress\r\n\r\nwould  be  fully  supported. In the circumstances,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, if we were to note the time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  has elapsed from the moment the resolution\r\n\r\nto  establish the Language Institute was  adopted\r\n\r\nup till now, I think, we are a little behind time\r\n\r\nin  setting  up this Institute. However,  with  a\r\n\r\nview  to  the full realisation and the fulfilling\r\n\r\nof the aspirations of the people, we have decided\r\n\r\nto establish a body known as the Dewan Bahasa dan\r\n\r\nKebudayaan Kebangsaan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we consider the objects of the\r\n\r\nInstitute, I am quite sure there will  be  nobody\r\n\r\nwho  will oppose them. On the contrary, they will\r\n\r\nbe  proud  of the fact that our objects are-based\r\n\r\non  facts and not on fiction. Mr Speaker, I wish\r\n\r\nto  bring  this  point to the  attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Kembangan, who has repeatedly\r\n\r\nand  indirectly  challenged  the  Government   to\r\n\r\ndeclare  its stand on the meaning of  culture.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the subject which we were discussing  just\r\n\r\nnow  is  similar to what we do when we provide  a\r\n\r\nsite to grow rice. We will provide the seed,  and\r\n\r\nthe  result will be that we will reap the harvest\r\n\r\nin  the future. So that only when the time  comes\r\n\r\nfor us to reap the harvest will we decide whether\r\n\r\nwe  are  going to make it into a bryani or  fried\r\n\r\nrice.  So  the  clarification asked  for  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Kembangan is not how  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to ensure that the harvest will be a  good\r\n\r\none, but what we are going to do when the rice is\r\n\r\nready  to  be cooked. I think this is a question,\r\n\r\nwhich  no linguist will be able to answer.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, I am not an expert on  language\r\n\r\nand culture. But from what little I know, culture\r\n\r\nis  not a dead thing, nor is it a thing which can\r\n\r\nbe  shaped  or  handled by human beings,  like  a\r\n\r\nshirt  for a man to put on. Culture is  a  living\r\n\r\norganism. No government could force any  kind  of\r\n\r\nculture  on  the  people, as was  quoted  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  or  Kampong Kembangan when this  sort  of\r\n\r\nthing happened during the Japanese Occupation. In\r\n\r\nthe  final  analysis, culture is evolved  by  the\r\n\r\npeople themselves, not by any government.  So  it\r\n\r\nis  up  to  the people of Malaya, who  owe  their\r\n\r\nundivided allegiance to this fair land  of  ours,\r\n\r\nto evolve a national culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am conscious of the fact that some\r\n\r\nfrivolous matters have been raised. For instance,\r\n\r\ncoaching  the representatives from the Indonesian\r\n\r\nbadminton  team putting on caps. But I think  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  who came to Singapore with  songkoks\r\n\r\nwere  Chinese. When they were asked, \"How do  you\r\n\r\ndo\",  they said, \"Well, thank you\". But we  would\r\n\r\nbe  disappointed if the residents  of  a  country\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore, which has accepted Malay as  its\r\n\r\nnational  language, were asked, \"How do you  do?\"\r\n\r\nin  Malay  and they would not be able to  answer.\r\n\r\nThe  basic problem is how to spread knowledge  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  language.  This  is  what  we  should\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on.  Similarly,  Mr  Speaker,  with\r\n\r\nother  matters  like the nature of -our  culture,\r\n\r\nnames   of   roads  and  so  on,  which   require\r\n\r\nclarification.  The setting up of  this  National\r\n\r\nLanguage  and  Culture  Institute,  as  has  been\r\n\r\nexplained by the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture, will lay the foundation  on\r\n\r\nwhich   we  can  enrich  and  develop  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  so that all the people will  learn  the\r\n\r\nMalay  language. Why do we refer  to  it  as  the\r\n\r\nBahasa   Kebangsaan  or  the  national  language?\r\n\r\nBecause the Malay Language Congress has made,  as\r\n\r\nits  slogan, language is the soul of the  nation.\r\n\r\nSo that if we know that the Malay language is the\r\n\r\nnational  language, then the soul of  the  nation\r\n\r\nwill  be  created  by the people themselves.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, it is not just a question of culture  or\r\n\r\nnational  language. A youth, if he is  forced  to\r\n\r\nmarry  a girl whom he does not know, will  reject\r\n\r\nher,  because, as the Malay saying goes, \"If  you\r\n\r\ndo  not  know someone, you will not love  him  or\r\n\r\nher.\" So the first step is to spread knowledge of\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  language to the people: so when  they\r\n\r\nhave  studied and grasped the Malay language they\r\n\r\nwill begin to have a love for it. Generations  of\r\n\r\nChinese and Indians will then have an interest in\r\n\r\nlearning the Malay language. When the people  are\r\n\r\nalready  versed in the knowledge of  the  various\r\n\r\ncultures  that exist in Malaya, then  there  will\r\n\r\nevolve   a   spirit   of   mutual   respect   and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  among  the  various   races.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, in the struggle to achieve our object of\r\n\r\nspreading\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  the Malay language,  we  must  work\r\n\r\nhard,  whether we are from the Government  or  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  benches. Our object is the same,  that\r\n\r\nis, to create a national culture. So, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe  point  is  to work hard - not  to  lead  or  to\r\n\r\ndemand. That can be equated to a child crying  for\r\n\r\nmilk.  But  for us, there should be  no  need  for\r\n\r\npleas  or  fears. The attitude we should adopt  is\r\n\r\n\"We  will do this. We will demonstrate to  society\r\n\r\nthat we are positive in our actions.\" For instance\r\n\r\nsepak  raga jaring, which is a national game.  The\r\n\r\nextent  to which this game is indulged in  can  be\r\n\r\nseen  from the fact that Chinese and Indian youths\r\n\r\nalso  have an interest in it, and they participate\r\n\r\nin  it.  I have heard that it was a Chinese  sepak\r\n\r\nraga  jaring  team,  which  won  the  championship\r\n\r\nrecently.  That is the kind of culture  which,  by\r\n\r\nitself,  has been accepted by all the races  which\r\n\r\nlive   in   Singapore.  Sepak  raga   jaring   has\r\n\r\nautomatically become a national game. So  I  hope,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, we should base our struggle  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  that we must work, work and  work.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment, on its part, will be pleased to accept\r\n\r\nany   constructive  criticisms.  So  that  is  the\r\n\r\nclarification  I wish to offer to the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan who has sought  information  as\r\n\r\nregards the nature of culture, whether all  of  us\r\n\r\nshould  put on caps, the changing of the names  of\r\n\r\nroads  to Malay names, whether ronggeng should  be\r\n\r\nemployed   at  wedding  feasts.  These   will   be\r\n\r\ndetermined by society. It would be too  premature\r\n\r\nat  this-stage to prophesy. I know Mr  Za'aba,  a\r\n\r\nprofessor, and Che'Gu Mahmud Ahmad, an  expert  on\r\n\r\nMalay  culture.  These experts themselves  do  not\r\n\r\ndare  to  come out into the open and say what  the\r\n\r\nnature of Malayan culture should be, because  they\r\n\r\nknow that culture is not a dead thing nor is it  a\r\n\r\nthing which could be forced on the people. Culture\r\n\r\nis  the  result  of  the birth  of  a  process  of\r\n\r\nenlightenment and refinement of taste acquired and\r\n\r\ngradually evolved by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):Mr Speaker, in regard to this\r\n\r\nBill  setting up a National Language  and  Culture\r\n\r\nInstitute, I feel it is not necessary or essential\r\n\r\nfor the Government to emphasise the objects of the\r\n\r\nBill  since  the Opposition Members realise  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  as  to how  they  are  going  to\r\n\r\ncreate   a   national  identity   comprising   the\r\n\r\ngenerations of the various races. It should not be\r\n\r\nthe attitude of the Government to use the piece of\r\n\r\npaper  on which the Bill is printed as a commodity\r\n\r\nto hoodwink the masses. As a responsible member of\r\n\r\nsociety  trying  to  create one  nationality,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I wish to emphasise this in no uncertain\r\n\r\nterms.  The Government itself is aware  that  this\r\n\r\nInstitute contains two schools of thought, one  of\r\n\r\nwhich is to create a united and strong nation.  In\r\n\r\ntalking about language and culture, there are -two\r\n\r\naspects,  which will benefit certain  sections  of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  Take the question  of  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage.  If we dwell at length on the fact  that\r\n\r\nMalay  is the national language, it will naturally\r\n\r\nimpress  the  Malays  because their  language  has\r\n\r\nbecome  the  national language. But  what  is  the\r\n\r\nobject of making Malay the national language?  Is\r\n\r\nit  because it is recognised, or is it because  it\r\n\r\nwill be an instrument, which will bring benefit to\r\n\r\nthose,  concerned? If the purpose is to  make  the\r\n\r\npeople realise that that is the only means whereby\r\n\r\nthey  can  improve themselves,  then  I  say  that\r\n\r\nlanguage  becomes  an instrument  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of the people. From the changes going  on\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia  and  the Federation  of  Malaya  at\r\n\r\npresent, we can see that the Malay language is the\r\n\r\nnational language. Therefore, in Singapore,  there\r\n\r\nis  no other way but to see that Malay becomes the\r\n\r\nnational language, because the use of the national\r\n\r\nlanguage  will  bring benefit  not  to  particular\r\n\r\nindividuals  but to all the people. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nshould  work together on this problem  so  as  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  national language become one  which  is\r\n\r\nnurtured and loved by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning culture, Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nGovernment side has stated that that is a matter,\r\n\r\nwhich cannot be forced on the people. But culture\r\n\r\nhas  its influence. Also it is culture, which can\r\n\r\nkeep one party apart from another, because to the\r\n\r\nindividual  using culture, it gives  rise  to  an\r\n\r\nexpression  of feelings and opinions.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nit is not something, which can wholly be accepted\r\n\r\nif  the  individual cannot raise himself  to  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  the culture. If this is  something,\r\n\r\nwhich can benefit us, we should use it. But if it\r\n\r\nis  something,  which is not in accord  with  us,\r\n\r\nthen  I  feel it can give rise to failure in  our\r\n\r\neffort to build a national culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for National Development today,  he\r\n\r\nstated  that the Opposition should not  have  any\r\n\r\nfears  about  the objects of this  Institute.  He\r\n\r\nsaid   we  should  wait  until  the  harvest   is\r\n\r\ncollected before we decide on what to do with it.\r\n\r\nIt  is as though the Member wanted to make fun of\r\n\r\nwhat  my  colleague has stated. We from  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nwill  continue to watch over this matter  because\r\n\r\nthe  Malays in Singapore, who have been  accepted\r\n\r\nby  law  as the indigenous people of the  island,\r\n\r\nlook  upon it weightily and we from U.M.N.O. will\r\n\r\noppose anything that is contrary to what is  laid\r\n\r\ndown in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say here, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture is about to hold a huge  mass\r\n\r\nmeeting  on  National  Day,  but  we  cannot   be\r\n\r\ntogether with them because what is to be  carried\r\n\r\nout on that day is not in accord with what we  in\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition think is healthy for the  people.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  second time that Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  are not together with the  Government\r\n\r\non  a national occasion. The dictatorial attitude\r\n\r\nadopted by the Ministry of Culture in refusing to\r\n\r\naccept  the  views and opinions  offered  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition is resented, and I hope this  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  due  consideration by  the  Government  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To talk about this and that and to tease one\r\n\r\nanother  in  this  Assembly  is  an  attitude  of\r\n\r\nirresponsibility. What we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  try to resolve is the problem of  how  to\r\n\r\nmake  Singapore prosperous so that every  citizen\r\n\r\nwill  feel that he is living in a safe and  sound\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to dwell further\r\n\r\non  the  matter except to elaborate on one point.\r\n\r\nThe  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development  has accused  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment of not setting up a similar Institute.\r\n\r\nThis  kind  of  talk  is irresponsible.  This  is\r\n\r\nmerely to win the acclaim of the people. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say  that  the  National  Language  and\r\n\r\nCulture  Institute in Malaya was  established  by\r\n\r\nlanguage  enthusiasts with  the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government,  but  the  Institute   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  to  be set up  by  the  Government\r\n\r\nitself.  So  you  will  find  that  there  is   a\r\n\r\ndifference  between the Institute in  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nthe  Institute  that  is  to  be  established  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  in  reply  to the  Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan,  let me reiterate that  culture  is  a\r\n\r\nliving  thing  and  it grows  constantly.  As  an\r\n\r\nexample,  drama  as an element  in  our  national\r\n\r\nculture  should be based on our national language\r\n\r\nbut  the  materials  used  in  our  drama  should\r\n\r\nreflect  a  Malayan  society  comprising  Malays,\r\n\r\nChinese, Indians and others.

Art  also\r\n\r\nrequires a Malayan element. Mr Speaker, Sir, our\r\n\r\nefforts  to unify the people should be  based  on\r\n\r\nthe   national  language.

The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  to  strengthen the law against  illegal\r\n\r\nbetting and illegal bookmaking. The second  is  to\r\n\r\nenable off-course betting to be held under certain\r\n\r\nconditions.  Sir, we on this side are not  opposed\r\n\r\nto  his  first purpose, although there are certain\r\n\r\ndefects  in  the  Bill to which my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer Park, will in due course  draw\r\n\r\nthe attention of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we read the Bill up to and including\r\n\r\nclause  22  and the two Bills that are  to  follow\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  we realise that the real  purpose  of\r\n\r\nmoving this and the following two Bills is not  so\r\n\r\nmuch to suppress common betting-houses, betting in\r\n\r\npublic  places  and  bookmaking,  as  to  legalise\r\n\r\nbetting  shops  and  provide more  facilities  for\r\n\r\nbetting  and gambling under certain conditions  by\r\n\r\nwhich  Government  will be able  to  increase  its\r\n\r\nrevenue.  There is nothing wrong - in  fact,  it  is\r\n\r\nlaudable\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- for the Government to look for ways and means to\r\n\r\nincrease revenue. But, Sir, there is a limit as to\r\n\r\nwhat  sort  of means should be employed  to  raise\r\n\r\nadditional  revenue. The Minister for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw  has been quoted by the Straits Times  in  its\r\n\r\nissue of Thursday, 7th April, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Byrne emphasised, 'We have no intention of\r\n\r\nencouraging gambling in any way.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I  agree with him. I wish he had also  said,\r\n\r\n\"We  wish to discourage gambling.\" I wish  he  had\r\n\r\nindicated  that  the desire of the  Government  is\r\n\r\nthat,  although it may not be possible to suppress\r\n\r\ngambling completely, they would try their best to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlimit and to reduce gambling to the smallest scale\r\n\r\npossible. But he went on, as if he had surrendered\r\n\r\nto the situation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But we must accept the fact that gambling is now\r\n\r\ntaking  place in Singapore on a large  scale,  and\r\n\r\nmuch of the profits\",\r\n\r\n<br><br>you   will   notice,  Sir,  that  the   capitalist\r\n\r\nmentality seems to be creeping in there -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"from this gambling goes into the pockets of\r\n\r\nbookies and gambling racketeers. No income tax  is\r\n\r\never paid on these profits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Minister added:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If there is to be gambling on this large scale,\r\n\r\nwe  might as well take the opportunity to see that\r\n\r\nthe State gets its proper share of the revenue.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  that  sort of reasoning is rather dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of kidnapping going on. Since it is\r\n\r\nimpossible  to  stop  or prevent  kidnapping,  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Labour  and  Law  is   practically\r\n\r\nsuggesting to his colleagues, \"Say, you chaps.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  stop  or prevent kidnapping. Huge  ransoms\r\n\r\nare being paid to the kidnappers. The State may as\r\n\r\nwell  go  into  the business. Get  a  few  fellows\r\n\r\nkidnapped,   and   then  we  can  get   additional\r\n\r\nrevenue.\"  Sir, it is dangerous to encourage  that\r\n\r\nsort  of reasoning in the State. It is like saying\r\n\r\nthat  since  secret society activities  cannot  be\r\n\r\ntotally suppressed, the Government should organise\r\n\r\ntheir   own  secret  society  for  the   sake   of\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  State  revenue.  I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nMinister would not do that, but there is a  danger\r\n\r\nin  that  the  young people in  Singapore  may  be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to reason along those lines.  A  wrong\r\n\r\nthing  does  not become right just because  it  is\r\n\r\nmade  legal.  A bad egg remains bad, although  one\r\n\r\nmay paint it white, black, red, green, or yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, Sir, agree that we should not encourage\r\n\r\ngambling. We should discourage it and limit it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is what we are doing!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> But I am afraid, Sir, the\r\n\r\npurpose  of this Bill is not to do so.  It  is  to\r\n\r\nexpand gambling, and the main purpose behind it is\r\n\r\nto   increase  the  revenue  of  the  State.  This\r\n\r\ndecision of Government has come as a shock to many\r\n\r\npeople.  Many  have praised Government  for  their\r\n\r\nanti-vice drives.

But what will  they  say\r\n\r\nwhen,  in place of the jukeboxes, they see betting\r\n\r\nshops; when, instead of gambling on a small scale,\r\n\r\nthey see gambling on a big scale? That seems to be\r\n\r\na great come down from the lofty perch established\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister  for  Home Affairs.  Instead  of\r\n\r\nfollowing the socialist line, they have  taken  to\r\n\r\nthe capitalist line and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, imagine in future, visitors to the State of\r\n\r\nSingapore  looking around. They  see  coffee-shops\r\n\r\nand  trading shops. They then come across  certain\r\n\r\nshops and, not knowing what they are, they ask the\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  \"What are those?\" The  answer  they\r\n\r\nget is, \"Oh! Those are betting shops.\" Is this the\r\n\r\nGovernment's new industry? Are we to see more  and\r\n\r\nmore, betting shops year by year? is Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbe  converted from the emporium of South-east Asia\r\n\r\nto  the  gambling den of South-east  Asia?  Surely\r\n\r\nthis  is contrary to the declared policy laid down\r\n\r\nby the People's Action Party in its Five-Year Plan\r\n\r\nagainst immoral and yellow culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was a boy, about 42 years ago, my\r\n\r\nfather  talked  about a gambling  den  across  the\r\n\r\nStraits of Johore. There was then no gambling  den\r\n\r\nin Singapore. There had been gambling on the five-foot  ways during Chinese New Year, but  that  had\r\n\r\ndisappeared   too.  Now,  42  years  later,   this\r\n\r\nGovernment has decided that we should go back,  to\r\n\r\nthe  most backward period of the colonial era, and\r\n\r\nreintroduce   public  gambling   places.   It   is\r\n\r\nregrettable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of raising State revenue by legalising\r\n\r\nbetting shops is not a new thing. Ever since 1947,\r\n\r\nofficials  in the Treasury have suggested  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that an easy way of replacing the  lost\r\n\r\nrevenue  from  the Government opium  monopoly  was\r\n\r\nthis  way. Time and again the subject was  brought\r\n\r\nup,  and Government at that time could have forced\r\n\r\nthe issue by using their official votes. But, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe must give credit where credit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  due. Although the Government at that time,  in\r\n\r\nthe   post-war  period,  had  the  majority,  they\r\n\r\nlistened   to  the  views  of  the  minority   and\r\n\r\nrestrained  their  hand. Betting  shops  were  not\r\n\r\nlegalised;  public lotteries were not  introduced.\r\n\r\nAnd  so  the  old Government lost  the  chance  of\r\n\r\nmaking   millions  of  dollars.  But  today   with\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  the  hands  of  a  Party  which  is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  make self-government a  success,  we\r\n\r\nfind  that in their desire to raise more  revenue,\r\n\r\nthey have decided to go back and reintroduce those\r\n\r\nmeasures  which  are regarded  as  unworthy  of  a\r\n\r\nGovernment and which have demoralising effects  on\r\n\r\nthe citizens of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are sorry that this Government, starting\r\n\r\nwith  high ideals, has been sorely tempted because\r\n\r\nof  its  need  for  funds to  do  what  they  have\r\n\r\ncondemned.  During the debate on  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill, they condemned the tax  evaders\r\n\r\nfor  doing something which is not quite right  for\r\n\r\nthe sake of profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Government to answer\r\n\r\nfive  questions. I hope the answers will be  given\r\n\r\nwithout  any hurling of abuse. The first  question\r\n\r\nis:  has  the  Government changed its  policy,  as\r\n\r\nindicated by the Minister for Home Affairs, in its\r\n\r\ncampaign  against  vice  and  yellow  culture   in\r\n\r\nSingapore? If a chap ji-ki promoter is caught,  he\r\n\r\nis  imprisoned or banished. Those who  participate\r\n\r\nor  help  the promoters are liable to  suffer  the\r\n\r\nsame  fate. But after these three Bills are passed\r\n\r\nthose  people who promote gambling on a big  scale\r\n\r\nunder   the  protection  of  this  Bill  will   be\r\n\r\nhonoured, because they can contribute a big  slice\r\n\r\nto  the  State revenue. So, on the one  hand,  you\r\n\r\nhave  the  chap-ji-ki promoter and his  supporters\r\n\r\ngetting  a prison sentence or being banished,  and\r\n\r\non  the  other  hand, you have gambling  promoters\r\n\r\ngetting the kudos. If this kind of policy goes on,\r\n\r\nthe  Government will very soon introduce legalised\r\n\r\nprostitution.  Later on they will reintroduce  the\r\n\r\nGovernment opium monopoly because there  is  money\r\n\r\nto  be  found  there. Sir, the Government  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  is  supposed to set  an  example  to  its\r\n\r\ncitizens as to what is right and wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the children in schools are told that they\r\n\r\nshould not gamble. When they gamble on the school\r\n\r\npremises   or  even  outside,  the   police   are\r\n\r\ninformed. Now what are the teachers to say to the\r\n\r\nchildren when these betting shops operate openly?\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing in the Bill  to  suggest  that\r\n\r\nthere is going to be an age limit for a schoolboy\r\n\r\nto place his bets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will be setting an unsavoury example\r\n\r\nto  the  citizens, especially the young citizens.\r\n\r\nIs this exchange worthwhile - $10 million extra for\r\n\r\nthe  public coffers, but the young manhood of the\r\n\r\nnation is being spoilt?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, during the election campaign,\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister warned public servants not  to\r\n\r\nbet  outside  office hours, but he  also  implied\r\n\r\nthat  there  was too much betting  during  office\r\n\r\nhours,  because  he  said that  the  phones  were\r\n\r\ncontinually  engaged. Does he want  to  encourage\r\n\r\nbetting  to  the extent that people  who  are  in\r\n\r\nGovernment   offices   regard   betting   as   an\r\n\r\nhonourable  game? If they get into  debt  because\r\n\r\nthey  participate in this new game introduced  by\r\n\r\nthe Government, are they liable to be sacked?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now ask the Minister for Labour and\r\n\r\nLaw  to  answer  the  second question?  Does  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  truly  and  sincerely  believe   that\r\n\r\nlegalised  betting :shops should be encouraged  -\r\n\r\nbecause  such  gambling  will  be  good  for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the people of Singapore? Sir, I have a\r\n\r\nrandom  selection of quotations  from  the  local\r\n\r\nPress. The Singapore Free Press of 24th February,\r\n\r\n1960,  has  this to say on betting. Perhaps  they\r\n\r\nsaid  it without knowing that the Government  was\r\n\r\nabout to introduce this Bill:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Betting is a mug's game\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints by punters at the Bukit Timah amateur\r\n\r\nmeetings  when they got back only  $5  for  their\r\n\r\nwinning $5 tickets after backing the winner  just\r\n\r\nprove again that betting is   a mug's game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty per cent of all the money going on to the\r\n\r\ntote   disappears  in  Government  tax  and  club\r\n\r\ncommission before the horses start.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dividends are paid out to the nearest dollar below the actual dividend, all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncents  from one to ninety-nine being broken money\r\n\r\nand retained by the Club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you bet long enough you lose all you start\r\n\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Government makes $10 million!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is one from the Sunday Times of January,\r\n\r\n20th, 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Coroner denounces gambling.

It is blood money because\r\n\r\nit  led to the death of citizens who should  have\r\n\r\ncontinued   to   live  and  contribute   valuable\r\n\r\nservices  to the country. Sir, now and  again  we\r\n\r\nread  of people who are well educated members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bar  and  who, I am sorry to say,  sometimes\r\n\r\nwere tempted because of this\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I would not mention names -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The one who has just got\r\n\r\nsuspended, I suppose!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> One was tempted and used the\r\n\r\nclient's  money.  A  former  clerk  was   tempted\r\n\r\nbecause  he  fancied he would gain  $16,000.  His\r\n\r\nfancy  did not come off, and he was sentenced  to\r\n\r\nthree  years' imprisonment. Another,  who  was  a\r\n\r\nsalesman, said that he punted on horses and  that\r\n\r\nled  him  to misappropriate gold ornaments  worth\r\n\r\n$12,000.  He pleaded guilty and was sentenced  to\r\n\r\n13 months' imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what happens to many unlucky fellows who\r\n\r\nbecome enamoured of the idea that they could make\r\n\r\nmoney  out of betting. There are only two parties\r\n\r\nwho are sure of making money on betting, and they\r\n\r\nare the organised and the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the face of these misfortunes, can the\r\n\r\nGovernment  maintain that the provision  of  more\r\n\r\nbetting  facilities  and more  opportunities  for\r\n\r\ngambling  would be for the good of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is this. Does the Government\r\n\r\nregard  betting shops as a good socialist  method\r\n\r\nof  raising  money  for the State?  The  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  claims to be  a  democratic,  non-communist,  socialist party. Is it  socialist  to\r\n\r\nresort  to  a  means of raising revenue  for  the\r\n\r\nState  whereby those who are poorest are made  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  the  most  in  proportion  to   their\r\n\r\nincome?  This  is an indirect way of  taxing  the\r\n\r\npeople,  so  that more money come from  the  poor\r\n\r\nthan from those who can afford it. The rich go to\r\n\r\nthe races; they buy lottery tickets, and they bet\r\n\r\nfor  fun. If they lose, they can stand it. It  is\r\n\r\nnothing  to  them. They know that the chances  of\r\n\r\nwinning are very meagre. But the poor are tempted\r\n\r\nbecause  of their poverty, forgetting that  their\r\n\r\nchances of winning are meagre. They bet, and they\r\n\r\nbet  more heavily than they can afford to,  which\r\n\r\nmeans  that many will lose money that could  have\r\n\r\nbeen better spent on food for their children  and\r\n\r\non  clothes.  Of course, it could  be  said  that\r\n\r\nthese  poor people should not bet. If they cannot\r\n\r\nafford  it,  they should not bet. It  is  like  a\r\n\r\nfisherman who dangles a tempting bait to the fish\r\n\r\nand  he  says to the half-starved fish,  \"Do  not\r\n\r\ntake  the  bait. Let the fat ones take it.\"  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  is  against human nature. The fat ones  are\r\n\r\nnot  likely to take the bait. But the hungry will\r\n\r\ndo it. And the poor in Singapore will be the ones\r\n\r\nmost tempted to take the bait and most tempted to\r\n\r\nlose money on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thought that this Government, when it\r\n\r\ncame  to  deciding  between  the  temptation   of\r\n\r\ngetting  more  money and losing  its  conscience,\r\n\r\nwould be prepared to lose the money and keep  its\r\n\r\nconscience.  Apparently  it  is  just  like   any\r\n\r\ncapitalist government. It is worse than the post-war  Government which resisted the temptation for\r\n\r\nthe sake of the people of Singapore. One argument\r\n\r\nis  this: if  it could be done in Australia  and\r\n\r\ncertain  other  countries, why cannot  we  do  it\r\n\r\nhere?  They  forget  that in  Australia  and  New\r\n\r\nZealand  the standard of living is so  high  that\r\n\r\nevery  worker  could afford to lose  some  money.\r\n\r\nHere the standard of living is not that high  and\r\n\r\nyet, with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreased unemployment, the Government say to the\r\n\r\nunemployed, \"Come along. Even with your dole  you\r\n\r\ncan give a portion back to the State.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fourth question is this. Does the\r\n\r\nGovernment  honestly believe that  betting  shops\r\n\r\nwill  reduce rather than stimulate more  gambling\r\n\r\nin  Singapore?  The argument is that,  by  having\r\n\r\nthese betting shops, business would be taken away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  illegal bookmakers and from those  who\r\n\r\ntake  part in chap-ji-ki gambling. Those who like\r\n\r\nchap-ji-ki will continue to gamble on the chap-ji-\r\n\r\nki. Those who like football will continue to play\r\n\r\nand watch football. It is not going to be easy to\r\n\r\nsay to them, \"We give you this new game; give  up\r\n\r\nthe  old  game. We give you the legalised betting\r\n\r\nshops; give up the chap-ji-ki\" it is not so easy.\r\n\r\nSo  the result would be that, in addition to  all\r\n\r\nthese  old  gambling faci1ities which  have  been\r\n\r\nregarded as illegal, there will be  these  new\r\n\r\nfacilities provided by the Government as a result\r\n\r\nof  the  legalisation of betting shops  and  more\r\n\r\nsweepstakes  and lotteries. If  there  is  to  be\r\n\r\ngambling on this scale, we might as well take the\r\n\r\nopportunity to see that the State gets its proper\r\n\r\nshare   of   revenue.   Its   proper   share   of\r\n\r\nrevenue - that seems to be the chief  aim  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth question. Will legalised betting shops\r\n\r\nmean  less  crime  in  Singapore?  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolice officers have consistently maintained that\r\n\r\nmore  gambling  means  more crime.  More  betting\r\n\r\nshops and more gambling facilities will mean more\r\n\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Party in power contested the last\r\n\r\nelections,  it did not say that it was  going  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  more gambling. In fact, the impression\r\n\r\ncreated  was  that  if this Party  was  put  into\r\n\r\npower,  it  would never resort to  anything  that\r\n\r\nwould be regarded as vice or yellow culture. Many\r\n\r\nvoted  for  this Party because they said,  \"Well,\r\n\r\nthis Party will be more honest and cleaner, etc.,\r\n\r\netc.\"  I am sorry to say that this is a big come-\r\n\r\ndown for the Party in power. This Bill will cause\r\n\r\nthe  Party  to lose the respect that some  people\r\n\r\nhad for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor  the  sake of more revenue, it is  willing  to\r\n\r\ngive  up its old policy, its anti-vice drive,  its\r\n\r\nclosure  of juke box shops. They are now finished.\r\n\r\nIt  is a new policy. Vice is dishonourable when it\r\n\r\nis  not legal. But vice becomes honourable when it\r\n\r\npays its contributions to the State coffers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that Government has got the votes to\r\n\r\npush  this Bill through, but is it really  earnest\r\n\r\nabout  the Will of the people? May I suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government do one thing? Let there  be  a  re\r\n\r\nferendum.  Let  the  Government  ask  the   people\r\n\r\nwhether they wish this Government to have more and\r\n\r\nmore gambling in order to raise more revenue. Some\r\n\r\nwill  vote for it. But if the people think of  and\r\n\r\ncare  enough for their children, they will  prefer\r\n\r\nto  lose the $10 million extra revenue and let the\r\n\r\nGovernment find it in some other way, rather  than\r\n\r\nhave  this Bill passed and have harm done  to  the\r\n\r\ncharacter  of the young citizens. Some  will  say,\r\n\r\n\"Why should there be all these moral scruples?\"  A\r\n\r\nman  is  honest because he has moral  scruples.  A\r\n\r\nGovernment is honest and it acts honestly  because\r\n\r\nit has moral scruples. If we are to throw away our\r\n\r\nmoral scruples for the sake of more revenue,  what\r\n\r\nsort  of policy are we going to introduce for this\r\n\r\ncountry? I am sorry, Sir, the respect which I  had\r\n\r\nfor  certain policies and measures of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment has received a great shock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I shall suspend this sitting\r\n\r\nuntil 5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>at 5.19 p.m. until 5.45 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.45 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BETTING BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, before I start speaking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   this  Bill,  please  permit  me  to  make   a\r\n\r\nconfession  in just one sentence.

It is difficult to\r\n\r\nthink of this Bill, which legalises the conducting\r\n\r\nand   promotion  of  more  betting  places,  which\r\n\r\ncreates   more   opportunities  for   betting   by\r\n\r\nlegalising betting on races run outside  Singapore\r\n\r\nas well as in Singapore, and which makes it easier\r\n\r\nfor  more  people to indulge in betting in  public\r\n\r\nplaces, as an Ordinance to suppress common betting-houses and betting in public places. This, Sir, is\r\n\r\na classic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexample  of  Government's  inconsistency.  May   I\r\n\r\nmention  in passing, Sir, that only last month  we\r\n\r\nhad the \"Monogamous Marriage\" Bill which legalises\r\n\r\nall  pre 2nd of March polygamous marriages! On the\r\n\r\none  hand, Government goes all out to get  rid  of\r\n\r\nvice,  but  on  the other hand their  Party  paper\r\n\r\nadvocates the legalising of prostitutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the public are confused by\r\n\r\nGovernment's - shall  I borrow  the  phrase  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance? - \"rushing from  gimmick  to\r\n\r\ngimmick to dazzle the public\". They feel that  the\r\n\r\ninconsistencies and contradictions  in  Government\r\n\r\nBills and policies are just an attempt to lead the\r\n\r\npublic  up  the  wrong path. The  Government  have\r\n\r\nalways  boasted that they have the  confidence  of\r\n\r\nthe  people,  but these inconsistencies  in  their\r\n\r\nBills   and   policies  will   soon   shake   this\r\n\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Government is not unaware that many\r\n\r\npeople  have become victims of moneylenders  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  betting, even when betting  in  public\r\n\r\nplaces is an offence. Now they will get themselves\r\n\r\nmore deeply into debt, especially when they can go\r\n\r\nboldly - and  within  the  law - to  a  betting  shop,\r\n\r\nperhaps a few yards from wherever they may be,  to\r\n\r\nplace  their  bets legally. One needs  no  crystal\r\n\r\nball,   Sir,   to   foresee   office-workers   and\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants  getting  themselves  heavily\r\n\r\nindebted  and  getting the sack  eventually,  thus\r\n\r\ncreating valuable vacancies which can be filled by\r\n\r\nmen whom Government think are more worthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nobody can deny that betting has brought\r\n\r\nabout  the  downfall of many an office-worker  and\r\n\r\nhas  brought  much misery and unhappiness  to  the\r\n\r\nhome  and the family. I therefore cannot  see  the\r\n\r\nsense of introducing a Bill, which, in effect, has\r\n\r\nevery possibility of bringing more misery and more\r\n\r\nunhappiness  to more homes and more families.  The\r\n\r\nargument  put  forward  that  because  we   cannot\r\n\r\ncontrol betting we must therefore legalise it does\r\n\r\nnot hold water, Sir. The youth of this country are\r\n\r\nattracted  towards joining secret societies.  What\r\n\r\ndid  Government do? Government did  not  recognise\r\n\r\nsecret  societies. I must compliment the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw  because  he organized, promoted and  expanded\r\n\r\nyouth   clubs,  community  activities,   etc, to\r\n\r\ndistract  these  young people from joining  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties.  He does not condone the  existence  of\r\n\r\nthese secret societies by legalising them. I think\r\n\r\nthe same thing should be done here. Something must\r\n\r\nbe  done  and  Government  must  surely  have  the\r\n\r\nability  to  think of ways and means  to  suppress\r\n\r\nbetting without legalising it, without the risk of\r\n\r\ngetting more people to go and bet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not so very long ago, at a time when the\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants were crying out  against  the\r\n\r\nslash in salaries and were complaining that it was\r\n\r\ncausing  them hardship, the Government  vigorously\r\n\r\nprotested that they were short of funds and  could\r\n\r\nnot  help it. You will remember that there  was  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion that the Government should run a  State\r\n\r\nlottery.  At  that time, the Government  indicated\r\n\r\nthat  they  were against the idea of  running  the\r\n\r\nState with revenue obtained from gambling. What is\r\n\r\nhappening   today,   Sir?   The   Government    is\r\n\r\nintroducing a Bill which cannot be of any  use  to\r\n\r\nanybody except to raise its revenue. The rich  who\r\n\r\ncan afford to bet will still go to the racecourse.\r\n\r\nThe  poor masses who cannot afford to go there  to\r\n\r\nbet will be plunging themselves and their families\r\n\r\ninto  disaster  if  they  frequent  these  betting\r\n\r\nshops. For whom are these betting shops? The  rich\r\n\r\nwill  not use them. The poor people will use  them\r\n\r\nto their own detriment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What crowns Satan with victory, Sir, is the fact\r\n\r\nthat  there is no provision in this Bill  to  stop\r\n\r\nschool  children from making use  of  the  betting\r\n\r\nshops. Probably Government have something in  mind\r\n\r\nto  do  something about it later on, but according\r\n\r\nto what we read in the Bill, there is no provision\r\n\r\nto indicate the age qualification of those who are\r\n\r\npermitted  to enter these betting shops and  place\r\n\r\ntheir bets. Clause 22 (3) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It shall be lawful ... to admit members of the\r\n\r\npublic to its premises ...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  school children and students are members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public,  are  they not? If  their  lives  and\r\n\r\nfuture  are ruined, the sins will be on the  heads\r\n\r\nof all those who support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is it worth the while raising revenue at the\r\n\r\nprice  of  destroying the peace and  happiness  of\r\n\r\nhomes?  Those  who  cannot afford  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nracecourse  are invariably the people  who  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  bet  without putting  themselves  into\r\n\r\ntrouble and getting themselves into debt. Then why\r\n\r\nin  the name of common sense tempt them with these\r\n\r\nfacilities  of  more  betting  houses  mushrooming\r\n\r\neverywhere  for them to place their  bets  legally\r\n\r\nwithout  any risk and inconvenience? If there  are\r\n\r\nany  here  who hail this Bill because it makes  it\r\n\r\nlegal  and convenient for them to spend their  pay\r\n\r\npackets  on  betting, let them bear in mind,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat they are courting their own downfall and  are\r\n\r\npreparing  to  hand over their jobs  on  a  silver\r\n\r\nplatter to their rivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, is based on the Betting\r\n\r\nOrdinance, the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya Betting Ordinance, 1953.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the  Comparative Table,  there  are\r\n\r\neight new clauses. Clause 22 is one of them,  Sir,\r\n\r\nand  it legalises betting houses for the rich  and\r\n\r\nthe  poor,  the young and the old, to place  their\r\n\r\nbets.  Clauses 8, 13 and 15, I am afraid, tend  to\r\n\r\ndeprive   the   people  of  their  civil   rights.\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens have always been proud  of  the\r\n\r\nadministration of justice by its Courts in that  a\r\n\r\nman  is  innocent  until he is  tried  and  proved\r\n\r\nguilty.  These  three clauses,  Sir,  make  people\r\n\r\nguilty before their trial, and the onus is on them\r\n\r\nto  prove  the contrary. Sir, clause  8  reads  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any person accepting a -\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Lady is going into\r\n\r\nthe  details  of the clauses, I suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nproper place to do so is in Committee. We are  now\r\n\r\ndealing with the general principle of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Surely, Sir, this Bill has\r\n\r\nbeen introduced to enable the Police to catch  and\r\n\r\nprosecute  the  guilty,  not  to  incriminate  the\r\n\r\ninnocent. To make people guilty before their trial\r\n\r\nand  until they prove the contrary is against  all\r\n\r\nprinciples of natural rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some clauses of this Bill defeat the aim of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  itself. As I have mentioned  before,  a\r\n\r\nBill  intituled  \"An Ordinance to suppress  common\r\n\r\nbetting-houses,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetting in public places . . .\" should, to say the\r\n\r\nleast, make an attempt to reduce the conducting of\r\n\r\nbetting  places and the promotion  of  betting  in\r\n\r\npublic  places; and not, as is the case with  this\r\n\r\nBill,  increase,  promote  and  legalise  betting-\r\n\r\nhouses   and   betting  in  public   places.   The\r\n\r\ngovernment of any State, Sir, has always been  and\r\n\r\nis  still  looked upon as the father of the  State\r\n\r\nand her people. Which father, Sir, would encourage\r\n\r\nhis  children to gamble or to bet, especially when\r\n\r\nhe knows that the children cannot afford to gamble\r\n\r\nwithout  destroying himself and his family?  Which\r\n\r\nfather  would  do  it? Perhaps a cruel  stepfather\r\n\r\nmight!   Now,   which  father  does   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment claim to be? A father to the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and her people, or the cruel step-father?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not\r\n\r\noften that the Opposition have had the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  bask  in the glow of superior virtue.  But  we\r\n\r\nquite  expect that in the course of the debate  on\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  they  will try to make the  Government\r\n\r\nlook  as  if they are encouraging what  they  term\r\n\r\n\"vice\". We also have seen, in the instances of the\r\n\r\ntwo Opposition Members who have spoken against the\r\n\r\nBill,  much  sanctimonious wringing of hands  over\r\n\r\nthe  poor,  the  weak and the  foolish,  who  ruin\r\n\r\nthemselves through gambling. But before I  attempt\r\n\r\nto  rebut  their  arguments, may I  first  make  a\r\n\r\ndisclaimer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Tanglin was holding forth at\r\n\r\nhis   usual  hilarious  best  on  this  Bill,   he\r\n\r\nrepeatedly made the point that the Government  was\r\n\r\nmoved  by  financial considerations to  pass  this\r\n\r\nBill;  that is, it is the demands of revenue  that\r\n\r\nhave  made them agree to allow off-course  betting\r\n\r\nunder  certain  conditions. Now, I hasten  to  add\r\n\r\nthat  I  am not the villain of the piece, nor  are\r\n\r\nfiscal considerations the over-riding or even  the\r\n\r\nimportant  ones in this issue. The  Government  of\r\n\r\ntoday - and indeed the Government under the previous\r\n\r\nadministration - has  to choose  between  two  alter\r\n\r\nnatives. The first is to allow off-course  betting\r\n\r\nunder    well-controlled,    properly    regulated\r\n\r\nconditions;   the   other  is  to   pretend   that\r\n\r\nbookmakers do not exist, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the vicious atmosphere in which the  illegal\r\n\r\nbookmaker   operates  together  with   the   whole\r\n\r\napparatus  of  secret society gangsters  does  not\r\n\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we of the P.A.P. are, above all, realists.\r\n\r\nWe  do not pretend that given the imperfections of\r\n\r\nhuman  nature  as they now exist  in  our  present\r\n\r\nsociety,  we shall be able to suppress  completely\r\n\r\ngambling  in  all its forms. The only  alternative\r\n\r\nthen  is  to see that such an activity carries  on\r\n\r\nunder  controlled  and well regulated  conditions.\r\n\r\nThat is the purpose of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin expressed great admiration\r\n\r\nfor  the  previous administrations  for  resisting\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  the  temptation  to  allow  off-course\r\n\r\nbetting. But he did not draw attention to the fact\r\n\r\nthat this policy was completely futile because off-course betting was in any case taking place to the\r\n\r\ndetriment  not  only of persons who  were  foolish\r\n\r\nenough to patronise these institutions but also to\r\n\r\nthe  loss  of  public revenue.  No  one  tries  to\r\n\r\npretend   that   gambling  is  not   foolish   and\r\n\r\nirrational  behaviour. But in a free society,  you\r\n\r\ncannot  completely eradicate these  manifestations\r\n\r\nof  a very natural instinct, as gambling is, among\r\n\r\nthe  people,  especially in a commercial  entrepot\r\n\r\nlike Singapore. If you are to aim at the ideal and\r\n\r\ntry  to eradicate gambling in all its forms,  then\r\n\r\nyou  will merely reduce the administration of  the\r\n\r\nlaw  to  ridicule and contempt. We  are  therefore\r\n\r\ntaking  the  courageous  stand  of  admitting  the\r\n\r\nimperfections of human nature, and try to make the\r\n\r\nbest of a bad job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to end on a light-hearted tone. The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin,  in the  last  part  of  his\r\n\r\nspeech,  declared  himself to be  disappointed  at\r\n\r\nthis  move  of  the Government. He said  that  his\r\n\r\nprevious  high regard for our sense of  dedication\r\n\r\nand high sense of purpose received a shock. I have\r\n\r\nalways  suspected that the Member for Tanglin  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  secret admirer of the P.A.P. but I  would\r\n\r\nnot  try to raise his hopes by saying that he  has\r\n\r\nany chance of being admitted into our circle!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> No desire!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not know about that. The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin has been  a  member  of  many\r\n\r\npolitical parties in the past, and I have no doubt\r\n\r\nthat if given half a chance he would ask us for an\r\n\r\napplication  form! If he feels so  strongly  about\r\n\r\nthis  issue, he will have one consolation - that  in\r\n\r\nhis  capacity as one of the leaders of  the  Moral\r\n\r\nRearmament   movement,   he   will    have    more\r\n\r\nopportunities    for   the   exercise    of    his\r\n\r\nproselytizing  zeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been quite\r\n\r\nnoticeable  for some time now that the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin   has  moved  so  often  in  the  rarefied\r\n\r\natmosphere  of moral rearmament that he  tends  to\r\n\r\nget out of touch with reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I stated in my speech on the\r\n\r\nSecond Reading of this Bill that the main purposes\r\n\r\nof  this Bill are, firstly, to strengthen the  law\r\n\r\nfor  the  suppression  of  common  betting-houses,\r\n\r\nbetting  in  public  places and  bookmaking,  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  to enable off-course betting on  racing\r\n\r\nto  be  conducted under certain conditions. I  did\r\n\r\nnot  hide anything. That was our objective. I also\r\n\r\nmade  it clear that although the increased  powers\r\n\r\nwhich  the  government sought in this  Bill  would\r\n\r\nhelp  it to deal more effectively with bookmaking\r\n\r\nand   betting,  we  had  also  taken  a  realistic\r\n\r\nattitude, and had taken the view that it is better\r\n\r\nto    control   bookmaking   and   betting   where\r\n\r\ncircumstances  are such as to make  it  impossible\r\n\r\nfor   us   to  suppress  bookmaking  and   betting\r\n\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not in any way changed\r\n\r\nfrom  our  socialist principles. We stand  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple that gambling is a social evil.  We  are\r\n\r\nalso  honest and we recognise the fact that  there\r\n\r\nis gambling on a large scale in our State. We have\r\n\r\ntaken  great  pains to bring this situation  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.  About ten months ago, below  the  office\r\n\r\nwhere  I  used  to work, I remember quite  clearly\r\n\r\nthere  was  a coffee shop. The public  went  there\r\n\r\nevery  day.  They were placing bets quite  openly.\r\n\r\nThey  could place any bet they wanted on any  race\r\n\r\nmeeting,  whether  the race meeting  was  hold  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or in the Federation of Malaya.  A  few\r\n\r\nsteps  along the same road, there was  a  gambling\r\n\r\nparlour - juke boxes,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npretty  girls - and everybody was tempted to go  in.\r\n\r\nThat  was  the situation, and everyone knew  about\r\n\r\nit.  These are facts. It is not the little  people\r\n\r\nwho  place bets and so on who are really the evil\r\n\r\ndoers.  The evil doers are the people who organise\r\n\r\nall  these things and get a profit out of it. They\r\n\r\norganise it, and they give you a discount  on  it.\r\n\r\nThey  make  their  money on it. They  exploit  the\r\n\r\nsituation,  and work it for a profit motive.  They\r\n\r\nkeep those profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, suppose we carry out our\r\n\r\nsocialistic    principles   to    their    logical\r\n\r\nconclusion. We hound the bookmakers. We  logically\r\n\r\nput  the Turf Club out of action. Well, they  will\r\n\r\ngo  across  the  causeway  and  start  a  gambling\r\n\r\nparadise  there.  We will then  get  back  to  the\r\n\r\nsituation which the Member for Tanglin referred to\r\n\r\n42  years ago, when his father could go across the\r\n\r\ncauseway  to  take  part  in  gambling.   We   are\r\n\r\nrealists. We know that that is the position and we\r\n\r\nhave got to face it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin has said\r\n\r\nthat  we  are now trying to reintroduce conditions\r\n\r\nsimilar to those existing during the time  of  his\r\n\r\nfather.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, clause 22,  sub-clause\r\n\r\n(1) of this Bill has been on our statute book from\r\n\r\n1929,  when  the Member for Tanglin was  11  years\r\n\r\nold. By virtue of the exemption provisions in this\r\n\r\nsub-clause,  it  is possible for  gambling  to  be\r\n\r\nrestricted   to  the  subscribing  and   associate\r\n\r\nmembers  of  a  particular racing  association  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Does he really honestly  believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  tickets on sweepstakes organised by the  Turf\r\n\r\nClub  are  not,  in fact, being sold  outside  its\r\n\r\nmembership to the people of Singapore? You can buy\r\n\r\nthe  tickets  if you want to. You need  not  be  a\r\n\r\nmember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that is the situation, and we\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  better  to  acknowledge  that  that\r\n\r\nsituation  exists and try to place gambling  under\r\n\r\nproper  control.  We can do it  by  extending  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of clause 22 (1) . Everybody knows  that\r\n\r\nany  member of the public can go to the Turf  Club\r\n\r\nand  take part in punting if he so desires.  There\r\n\r\nis such a membership as the subscribing membership\r\n\r\nand it is known that subscribing members transfer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir badges to one another. It is quite easy  for\r\n\r\nany  member of the public to go to the race course\r\n\r\nif  he  wants  to.  So let us not be  hypocritical\r\n\r\nabout  these things. Let us acknowledge the facts.\r\n\r\nIf   we  do  that,  we  can  reconcile  these  two\r\n\r\napparently conflicting objectives. In this Bill we\r\n\r\nare  taking determined steps to put the bookmakers\r\n\r\nout  of action. We mean everything we say. We have\r\n\r\nintroduced  very hard presumptions.  Why  have  we\r\n\r\ndone  it?  It  is because it is very difficult  to\r\n\r\ndetect  and bring the bookmakers to book for  what\r\n\r\nthey  do.  That is why we have to depend on  these\r\n\r\npresumptions. The Member for Mountbatten has  said\r\n\r\nthat  we  are seeking to change the  law  and  to\r\n\r\nalter our liberal tradition by making persons  who\r\n\r\nare    innocent   guilty.   These   are   ordinary\r\n\r\npresumptions which, we have to introduce if we are\r\n\r\nto  mean what we say. I have mentioned that in the\r\n\r\nspeech  I  made  earlier  on.  I  have  drawn  the\r\n\r\nattention of the House to these presumptions. They\r\n\r\nare  hard  presumptions. They are intended  to  be\r\n\r\nhard  presumptions so that we can deal  with  this\r\n\r\nsituation effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also pointed out that it is our intention\r\n\r\nto  raise  the penalties for this type of offence,\r\n\r\nand we have so proposed in this Bill. It is no use\r\n\r\npeople  blinking facts and charging  us  with  all\r\n\r\nsorts of things, accusing us of inconsistency  and\r\n\r\nsaying  that  we  are jettisoning our  principles.\r\n\r\nThey do not believe the things that they say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has referred to our\r\n\r\nmonogamous marriage Bill. She said, \"Look  at  it.\r\n\r\nThis Bill which seeks to introduce monogamy is the\r\n\r\nsame  Bill which legalises prostitution.  What  is\r\n\r\nall  this  about?\" Mr Speaker, Sir,  on  the  3rd\r\n\r\nMarch,  when this Bill was introduced. I  remember\r\n\r\nmeeting  the Member for Mountbatten in the Hokkien\r\n\r\nHuay  Kuan.  The women of Singapore had  called  a\r\n\r\npublic  meeting  to express their  views  on  this\r\n\r\nBill.  I  remember the Member for Mountbatten  was\r\n\r\nthere and she asked permission from the ladies  to\r\n\r\nspeak.  She went on to the platform. I was curious\r\n\r\nto  hear the things she would say about this Bill.\r\n\r\nShe  welcomed,  it  and said:  \"Dear  sisters,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  we have now come to the position  where\r\n\r\nat last we women have got\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  freedom.\" She spoke for three-quarters of  an\r\n\r\nhour, and I clapped her. For I then believed  that\r\n\r\na great change had come over her. But when I heard\r\n\r\nher later in the House, I was so stupefied that  I\r\n\r\neven forgot to remind her of what she had said  at\r\n\r\nthe  Hokkien  Huay  Kuan a few weeks  before.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, we are not that sort of people.  We\r\n\r\nare not chameleons. We do not change our colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is a direct reference to\r\n\r\na  Member  of  this  House. To  call  a  Member  a\r\n\r\nchameleon is unparliamentary. Perhaps the Minister\r\n\r\nwould like to withdraw that word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I realise I was getting\r\n\r\nvery near to the rocks and the shoals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister withdraw?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I do withdraw, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  all  things  we  have got to  be  honest  with\r\n\r\nourselves  first. We must understand the situation\r\n\r\nin which we find ourselves. We cannot blink facts.\r\n\r\nWe must not try to distort facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin was in his element just\r\n\r\nnow   when   he   talked  of  the   exploits   and\r\n\r\nachievements of the past Government with which  he\r\n\r\nwas so closely associated. Mr Speaker, Sir, if he\r\n\r\nwas  a  realist,  and if he really understood  the\r\n\r\nsocial  position, he would have  agreed  that  the\r\n\r\nbest  way to deal with the situation would be  not\r\n\r\nto  blink facts but to accept the position as  one\r\n\r\nfinds  it  and try to resolve the difficulties  as\r\n\r\nbest one can. And that is what we have proposed in\r\n\r\nthis Bill. That is the solution we offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there was the charge made\r\n\r\nagainst   us   that   we   were   increasing   the\r\n\r\nopportunities for betting; that we might have good\r\n\r\nintentions  but  that those good  intentions  were\r\n\r\nfoiled by faulty methods of implementation.  That\r\n\r\nwe  might, after all, have ulterior motives behind\r\n\r\nthese  pseudo-good  intentions.  Is  that  a  fair\r\n\r\ncharge to make? Does this Bill really and honestly\r\n\r\nencourage  gambling and increase the opportunities\r\n\r\nfor betting? If it did, we would not have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintroduced those presumptions. Why did we?  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause we are realists, we really intend to  deal\r\n\r\nwith the situation and with those who make profits\r\n\r\nout   of  gambling  and  keep  those  profits  for\r\n\r\nthemselves,   that   we  have   introduced   these\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was also pointed out that\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing  in  this legislation  to  stop\r\n\r\nstudents  and school children from going  to  the\r\n\r\nbetting  shops. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthe Members who made that charge really understood\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of clause 22. It is clearly stated\r\n\r\nin that clause that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Yang di-Pertuan Negara may by notification in\r\n\r\nthe  Gazette,  either generally or  in  particular\r\n\r\ncases, exempt from all or any of the provisions of\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance  the members and officers  of  any\r\n\r\nracing  club  or  association in  respect  of  any\r\n\r\ntotalisator  or pari-mutuel betting or  any  other\r\n\r\nsystem or method of cash or credit betting...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the organisation that is\r\n\r\nexempted under the provisions of this clause would\r\n\r\nbe exempted under conditions, and it would be well\r\n\r\nwithin   the  organisation's  power  to   restrict\r\n\r\nchildren and school children from entry into  such\r\n\r\npremises.    They   could   easily   make    those\r\n\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out that\r\n\r\nunder  clause 22 (3) of the Bill we have  provided\r\n\r\nthat  all  bets  received must be  placed  on  the\r\n\r\ntotalisator.  We have provided that  it  would  be\r\n\r\nunlawful for any such organisation to run its  own\r\n\r\nprivate  book.  That is the protection,  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  sought, and that is the safeguard, which  we\r\n\r\nhave entered in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that earlier on the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin referred at length to  various\r\n\r\nnewspapers on the evils of gambling and so on.  As\r\n\r\nluck would have it, I was also referred today to a\r\n\r\nnewspaper  report.  This  report  appears  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Free Press of Thursday, 12th May.  What\r\n\r\ndoes the report say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Off-Course Betting In Britain by July\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London, Thurs.-The House of Commons lust night\r\n\r\npassed  a Government Bill to legalise cash betting\r\n\r\non  horse races in betting shops to be set up  all\r\n\r\nover the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voting was 211 to 42 - a Government majority of 169.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, expected to become law by the end of\r\n\r\nJuly, now goes to the House of Lords.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, probably there  are  people\r\n\r\nelsewhere  in  the  world who  are  realists  like\r\n\r\nourselves.  They  look at a particular  situation,\r\n\r\nthey see it to be what it is, and they are willing\r\n\r\nto  move with the times. But there are some people\r\n\r\nwho  are  so bound up with the colonial  tradition\r\n\r\nthat they can only think in terms of that colonial\r\n\r\ntradition. They believe that a person who is  part\r\n\r\nand parcel of that system can do a thing only in a\r\n\r\ncertain  way  and believe it to be right  for  all\r\n\r\ntime.  Now  we are not like that. We do  not  have\r\n\r\nthose mental blinkers. We see the situation as  it\r\n\r\nis  and  we are determined to find a solution  for\r\n\r\nthe difficulties that we meet. That is why we have\r\n\r\nproposed this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been challenged to answer five questions.\r\n\r\nThe   first  question  is:  Have  we  changed  our\r\n\r\npolicies  as  announced by the Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs against vice and yellow culture? I say  we\r\n\r\nhave  not  changed  our  policies.  We  are  still\r\n\r\nagainst vice and yellow culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Government truly and sincerely believe\r\n\r\nthat  legalized  betting shops should  be  set  up\r\n\r\nbecause gambling would be for the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore? The answer is that  gambling\r\n\r\nis  a social evil. There are people who still want\r\n\r\nto  gamble,  whatever you do, Even in co-operative\r\n\r\norganisations  you will find that  situation.  You\r\n\r\nwill  find  the  thrifty  lending  money  to   the\r\n\r\nimprovident. Now, most of the improvident have got\r\n\r\nvery   firm   contacts  with   moneylenders.   But\r\n\r\nnevertheless  that  sort of  thing  goes  on.  The\r\n\r\nprovident earn dividends from that situation. That\r\n\r\nis  how  the  co-operative  and  thrift  and  loan\r\n\r\nsocieties run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 3 was: Does the Government regard\r\n\r\nbetting  shops  as a good source of raising  money\r\n\r\nfor the State? We have never wanted to raise money\r\n\r\nby  this method. We have said that there are  many\r\n\r\npeople making money out of bookmaking and keeping\r\n\r\nthat money,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrunning  these  rackets for  their  own  purposes,\r\n\r\ngiving discounts, giving credits and earning -huge\r\n\r\nprofits. Now we say that we want to put all end to\r\n\r\nthat,  to  stop  them from doing it.  We  will  so\r\n\r\nreorganise  it that this money will  come  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But we do not do this  primarily  for\r\n\r\nthe,  reason that we want this money. If they take\r\n\r\nthose pro, fits in that way, it is but right  that\r\n\r\nthey should be stopped from doing so: that we,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  should avail ourselves  of  that\r\n\r\nmoney.   Question  No.  4.  Does  the   Government\r\n\r\nhonestly  believe that betting shops  will  reduce\r\n\r\nrather than stimulate gambling? I do not think you\r\n\r\ncan make the situation worse than it is today.  It\r\n\r\nis on a very large scale. It is already stimulated\r\n\r\nout of all proportions and the only thing to do is\r\n\r\nto keep it under control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 5. Will these legalized betting\r\n\r\nshops  mean  less  crime  in  Singapore?  I  would\r\n\r\nventure  a  guess, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  if  we\r\n\r\nbring this situation under proper control, we will\r\n\r\nbe  able to reduce the incidence of crime.  It  is\r\n\r\nwell   known  that  many  bookmakers   are   given\r\n\r\nprotection  by  secret societies.  They  carry  on\r\n\r\nthese operations with the protection received.  If\r\n\r\nall  this is brought under proper control, I could\r\n\r\nsay that we would be able to reduce crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say that we have\r\n\r\ngood  intentions, we have no ulterior  motives  in\r\n\r\nintroducing this legislation, and we do  not  ever\r\n\r\ntry  to conceal ulterior motives under pseudo-good\r\n\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Byrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 5 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 6 stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this clause seeks to\r\n\r\nprovide:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any person who announces or publishes or causes\r\n\r\nto  be announced or published, either orally or by\r\n\r\nmeans  of  any print, writing, sign or  otherwise,\r\n\r\nthe  result  of  any public lottery or  horse-race\r\n\r\nshall  be guilty of an offence and shall be liable\r\n\r\non conviction to a fine not exceeding two thousand\r\n\r\ndollars:\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my understanding of the words,\r\n\r\n\"announces  or publishes\" is this: if  one  person\r\n\r\nmentions  by  word of mouth or  in  writing  to  a\r\n\r\nsecond person, then that is announcing or publish.\r\n\r\ning within the meaning of the clause. So that this\r\n\r\nposition  could easily arise. I go  to  the  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  Race Course. Having lost all my money after\r\n\r\nthe third race, I retire and come back. On the way\r\n\r\nI  meet Mr X, who is anxiously awaiting a bus  to\r\n\r\nget  to the Turf Club. He says, \"Hey, what is  the\r\n\r\nmatter with you? Why are you back so early?\" I say\r\n\r\n\"Well,  I lost my Bets on the first three  races.\r\n\r\nSuch  and such a horse won the first race.  I  did\r\n\r\nnot  back it. Such and such a horse won the second\r\n\r\nrace. I did not back it. Such and such a horse won\r\n\r\nthe  third  race. I did not back  it.\"  That,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, is announcing or publishing  within\r\n\r\nthe meaning of this clause, as I see it. Is it the\r\n\r\nintention  of  the Government that such  a  person\r\n\r\nshould be guilty of an offence and shall be liable\r\n\r\non conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to make is on the\r\n\r\nproviso, which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Provided however that this section shall not\r\n\r\napply to anything published or forming part of any\r\n\r\nannouncement  in  any newspaper  relating  to  any\r\n\r\nhorse-race or the result thereof if such newspaper\r\n\r\nhas  been printed or published under a licence  in\r\n\r\nthat  behalf  duly issued in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Printing Presses Ordinance.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means, I take it, Mr Speaker, that the\r\n\r\nright to publish or announce, as prohibited in the\r\n\r\nmain  clause,  is only available to any  newspaper\r\n\r\nand  that  only  to any horse-race or  the  result\r\n\r\nthereof.  Although the main clause talks  about  a\r\n\r\npublic lottery, the proviso does\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  say  anything about it. The subsequent  Bills\r\n\r\nwhich  will  come up before the House will  enable\r\n\r\npublic   lotteries  to  be  run.  So,   does   the\r\n\r\nGovernment    then   intend   this   position - that\r\n\r\nnewspapers can only publish the results of  horse-races  but  they may not publish the winner  of  a\r\n\r\nlottery ticket?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the intention is to\r\n\r\nprohibit  oral  communication of  the  results  of\r\n\r\nhorse-races. Mr Speaker, Sir, it has  been  found\r\n\r\nthat  when  the  Turf  Club recently  removed  all\r\n\r\nfacilities  with regard to public  telephones  and\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Rediffision broadcasts  of  races  were\r\n\r\nstopped,  there  were  teams  of  people   running\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Turf  Club and  neighbouring  coffee\r\n\r\nshops  and  communicating the  racing  results  to\r\n\r\ninterested   persons.  It  is  the  intention   to\r\n\r\nprohibit  that sort of thing in this  clause.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, there are precedents  for  this.  I\r\n\r\nwould  refer the Member for Farrer Park to section\r\n\r\n4  (f)  of  the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance.  I\r\n\r\nwill read the section to him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any person who -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) writes, prints or publishes or causes to be\r\n\r\nwritten,  printed or published any lottery  ticket\r\n\r\nor  list  of  prizes  or any announcement  of  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  a  public lottery or any  announcement\r\n\r\nrelating to a public lottery;...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>shall be liable  to\r\n\r\na  fine not exceeding six thousand dollars  or  to\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to  three\r\n\r\nyears.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his second submission with regard to the\r\n\r\nproviso,  I  think the intention is  to  permit  a\r\n\r\nlicensed  newspaper  to make these  announcements,\r\n\r\nSir,It will be necessary, I think, to include  in\r\n\r\nthis  proviso reference to a public lottery.  \"The\r\n\r\nresult  of  any  public lottery or horse-race\"  is\r\n\r\ncontained  in  clause 6. But for  some  reason  or\r\n\r\nother,  the  reference  to  \"public  lottery\"  was\r\n\r\ninadvertently omitted in the proviso. The  proviso\r\n\r\nshould really read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...any news paper relating to the result of any\r\n\r\npublic lottery or horse-race\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>using the same words in the main clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any newspaper relating to the result of any\r\n\r\npublic lottery or horse-race\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that we refer to\r\n\r\nthe relevant Standing Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will resume his\r\n\r\nseat, I will puzzle this one out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Minister then wish to seek\r\n\r\nleave to move an amendment:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, lines 22 and 23, to leave out \"any\r\n\r\nhorse-race or the result thereof\" and insert  \"the\r\n\r\nresult of any public lottery or horse-race\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the pleasure of hon.

Public  lotteries  were  not\r\n\r\npossible  in the Colony, but now, as a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe various amendments to this Bill and to the two\r\n\r\nsubsequent Bills, public lotteries, provided  they\r\n\r\nare  conducted in a particular manner, will  cease\r\n\r\nto be illegal.

I appreciate the motives  which  have\r\n\r\nimpelled the Minister to frame the clause,  but  in\r\n\r\nframing it, the scope of the clause is so wide that\r\n\r\nit has taken in the case of the man - as I cited -  who\r\n\r\nwent  to the race-course to bet, came out when  the\r\n\r\nrace  meeting  had gone halfway, and  said  to  his\r\n\r\nfriend,  \"My  horses did not come  in.  Some  other\r\n\r\nhorses came in,\" and he mentioned the names of  the\r\n\r\nhorses. It seems to me that he is certainly  guilty\r\n\r\nunder  this  clause, because he has  announced  the\r\n\r\nresults of a horse-race.

The question on  which\r\n\r\nthe   presumption  will  arise  is  whether  these\r\n\r\narticles  were,  in fact, used in that  particular\r\n\r\ncase for smoking opium. But the presumption arises\r\n\r\nby the very nature of the articles, which can only\r\n\r\nbe  used for smoking opium. Here, Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nposition  to  my  mind  is quite  different.  This\r\n\r\npolice  officer  not below the  rank  of  Sergeant\r\n\r\nbrings   along   any   book,  account,   document,\r\n\r\ntelegram,   writing,  circular,  card   or   other\r\n\r\narticle, produces them in Court and says that they\r\n\r\nwere  intended to be used for betting or wagering.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  presumption shall arise. Now, a book  by\r\n\r\nits  very  nature  can be used for  all  sorts  of\r\n\r\npurposes.  Similarly, an account,  a  document,  a\r\n\r\ntelegram, a piece of writing, a circular, a  card,\r\n\r\nor  any  other  article.  While  appreciating  the\r\n\r\nelusiveness  of the bookmaker and the  anxiety  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to bring him down in a legal tackle,\r\n\r\nI  feel, Mr Speaker, Sir that, the presumption is\r\n\r\nso  wide in its scope and its nature that it could\r\n\r\nvery  easily be refuted. I think a presumption  of\r\n\r\nthis  nature  will not cause the  person,  against\r\n\r\nwhom  the  presumption arises, any  difficulty  in\r\n\r\nrebutting it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would refer the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park to a more recent precedent.\r\n\r\nIt  was not long ago that the Common Gaming Houses\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was  amended in  this  House.  On  that\r\n\r\noccasion, Mr Speaker, Sir, there was an amendment\r\n\r\nto section 9, which is very much on similar lines.\r\n\r\nIf  I  may  read  this to the  Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark - the amendment reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Where evidence is given by a police officer not\r\n\r\nbelow  the  rank  of  Sergeant that  any  document\r\n\r\nproduced  before the court is a lottery ticket  of\r\n\r\nany  public  lottery or is an account, memorandum,\r\n\r\nor  record  of stakes or wagers in or relating  to\r\n\r\nany  public lottery, the court shall presume  that\r\n\r\nsuch  document is a lottery ticket of such  public\r\n\r\nlottery  or  an account, memorandum or  record  of\r\n\r\nstakes  or  wagers in or relating to  such  public\r\n\r\nlottery, as the case may be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, I have got the Hansard report on\r\n\r\nmy   Second  Reading  speech  in  regard  to  that\r\n\r\namendment Bill, and I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremember that I pointed out to the House then that\r\n\r\nby this clause the Court is required to accept the\r\n\r\nevidence of a police officer not below the rank of\r\n\r\nSergeant, that the document produced before it  is\r\n\r\na  lottery  ticket  or an account,  memorandum  or\r\n\r\nrecord  of  stakes or wagers in or relating  to  a\r\n\r\npublic  lottery.  On that occasion,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer  Park did not  pay  very  much\r\n\r\nattention to this clause, but rather he sought  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the  Minister might  be  very  much\r\n\r\ntempted   to   abuse  his  powers  under   another\r\n\r\namendment -  an amendment to section  2 - which  gave\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  power,  by  notification  in   the\r\n\r\nGazette,  to  declare  any game,  method,  device,\r\n\r\nscheme  or  competition to be a  lottery  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of the Ordinance. He suggested that  the\r\n\r\nMinister might even think of declaring football to\r\n\r\nbe  a  public lottery. Now, mark you, he was aware\r\n\r\nof  that clause then and took no objection to  it.\r\n\r\nThis  provision  is  not  new.  It  is  a  similar\r\n\r\npresumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> With respect to the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Law - that particular section which  the\r\n\r\nHon. Minister quoted just now was in reference  to\r\n\r\n\"public  lottery\".  The position  then  was  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent.  There  would  be  numbers  on  it   to\r\n\r\nindicate  that it was part and parcel of a  public\r\n\r\nlottery.  Therefore  the presumption  arises.  The\r\n\r\nposition  here is that any book, account, document\r\n\r\nor  telegram received by some person or other  and\r\n\r\nwhen  produced by a police officer is presumed  to\r\n\r\nbe intended to be used for betting or wagering. It\r\n\r\ncould be that the document, on the face of it, has\r\n\r\nnothing whatsoever to do with betting or wagering.\r\n\r\nAll  that  need happen is a statement by a  police\r\n\r\nofficer  that that ,particular book or account  is\r\n\r\nused   for   betting   or   wagering.   In   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  the presumption  could  easily  be\r\n\r\nrebutted  by the accused saying, \"I bought  it  to\r\n\r\nkeep my accounts\", or something like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If the book was bought to\r\n\r\nkeep  an  account,  I am quite sure  the  evidence\r\n\r\nwould  be  rebutted and the accused acquitted.

If   in   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances, he made a statement, I  think  the\r\n\r\nconsequences  envisaged  in  that  clause  should\r\n\r\nensue.  But why the State insists that it  should\r\n\r\nalso  be  made  \"wilfully\", I am  at  a  loss  to\r\n\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this, in fact, is a\r\n\r\nvintage  section  of  the  Ordinance.  The   word\r\n\r\n\"wilfully\"  appears in section 9 of the  existing\r\n\r\nOrdinance, which became law in 1934, having  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  by the Betting (Amendment)  Ordinance\r\n\r\nin 1934. This word \"wilfully\" has been in the law\r\n\r\nfor  the  past  26  years, and we  have  made  no\r\n\r\nchanges to the existing section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> All I can say to the Minister for Law\r\n\r\nis  that it is high time that he took the cobwebs\r\n\r\noff  some  of our laws. I am suggesting,  in  all\r\n\r\nseriousness to the Minister, that this is one  of\r\n\r\nthe  sections  which  should be  changed.  Merely\r\n\r\nbecause  it has remained in our Statute book  for\r\n\r\n26  years does not make it sacrosanct. When it is\r\n\r\nclearly  bad  legislation,  then,  when  we   are\r\n\r\nbringing about amending legislation, it  is  time\r\n\r\nwhen these imperfections should be eradicated.  I\r\n\r\nam  suggesting  to  the Minister  that  the  word\r\n\r\n\"wilfully\"  should  be taken out.  I  suppose  in\r\n\r\nthose  days it was necessary for the Police Force\r\n\r\nto  function efficiently to have these  informers\r\n\r\nand give them full protection. But nowadays we do\r\n\r\nnot  need  these informers. The Minister  himself\r\n\r\nhas said so, \"Our Police are not go-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ning  to  depend on informers but on their own  two\r\n\r\nfeet\" - big feet. So I feel, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nit  is time the word \"wilfully\" went out. To  give\r\n\r\nprotection to the informer, all that need be  said\r\n\r\nis,  \"That he made a material statement  which  he\r\n\r\nknew  or  believed to be false, or did not believe\r\n\r\nto be true\". If he did any of those things, surely\r\n\r\nthen   the  consequences  envisaged  there  should\r\n\r\nensue.  Why  should a person, who seeks  to  prove\r\n\r\nthat  a  false statement has been made on  top  of\r\n\r\nthat,  have  to prove that, \"He did it wilfully.\"?\r\n\r\nOne has to prove mens rea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, must we keep\r\n\r\nrepeating ourselves all the time? The point I made\r\n\r\njust  now  was  that  this  word  \"wilfully\"   was\r\n\r\nimported   into  the  section  by   an   amendment\r\n\r\nOrdinance  enacted in 1934. And  there  were  good\r\n\r\nreasons   why   that   amendment   Ordinance   was\r\n\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Well, this is a new Bill and I take\r\n\r\nit that it is intended that the various clauses in\r\n\r\nthis  new  Bill  should stand  or  fall  on  their\r\n\r\nmerits.  It  is  no  use the  Minister  trying  to\r\n\r\nbolster  his  case  by  saying  that  an  amending\r\n\r\nOrdinance   previously   introduced   this    word\r\n\r\n\"wilfully\".  No doubt there might have  been  very\r\n\r\ngood  reasons for introducing it 26 years ago when\r\n\r\ncolonialism was in its hey-day. But when  we  have\r\n\r\ngot   self-government  by  people  rooted  in  the\r\n\r\nmasses, I think we should really view these things\r\n\r\nproperly  and kick the informer where he  deserves\r\n\r\nto be kicked. He does not need such protection. It\r\n\r\nmay be that in the old days the informer had to be\r\n\r\nprotected on all sides, and the Crown made it very\r\n\r\ndifficult for him to be got at. Whereas now, if an\r\n\r\ninformer  gives information which gets  a  private\r\n\r\ncitizen into trouble and if the Court comes to the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that the information given was  false,\r\n\r\nand  the informer knew that it was false,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink the consequences envisaged should ensue.

It  is\r\n\r\nthis Government's policy to wipe out this form  of\r\n\r\nillicit gambling which goes on on a large scale in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  since it undermines  the  welfare  and\r\n\r\nmorale of the people. Gambling has therefore to-be\r\n\r\nconfined within the limits permitted by the law so\r\n\r\nthat the State and the people can be protected. To\r\n\r\nthis  end, Government is introducing three related\r\n\r\nBills  incorporating  the  recommendations-of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  committees  which have  been  set  up  to\r\n\r\nexamine the problem of illegal betting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Betting and Sweepstake Duties\r\n\r\nOrdinance  provides for betting on the totalisator\r\n\r\nor  pari-mutuel and sweepstakes promoted by racing\r\n\r\nclubs and associations by the members only.

Therefore, by  throwing  open  to  the\r\n\r\npublic participation in the properly organised and\r\n\r\nlegal  activities of such clubs and  associations,\r\n\r\nby  allowing these clubs and associations to  sell\r\n\r\nsweepstake   tickets  partly  in   Singapore   and\r\n\r\nelsewhere,  bookmakers  will  be  driven  out   of\r\n\r\nbusiness.  In addition, it is intended to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  the  collection of duty on any other kind  of\r\n\r\nbetting  that may be promoted by racing  clubs  or\r\n\r\nassociations  which is made or  conducted  through\r\n\r\nany totalisator or pari-mutuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, that these amendments will once\r\n\r\nand  for  all take care of what has been a serious\r\n\r\nloss  of  revenue  and  a danger  to  the  healthy\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister, in moving the\r\n\r\nSecond Reading of the Bill, has made reference  to\r\n\r\nthis  curse  which is not only confronted  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government but also by the Government of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya. Since he has brought  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government  of the Federation  of  Malaya,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to know, Sir, whether there  had  been\r\n\r\nany consultation with that Government before these\r\n\r\nthree Bills were introduced?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what I am\r\n\r\ntroubled about is that an assurance has been given\r\n\r\nverbally that gambling facilities and so  on  will\r\n\r\nbe  reduced,  but  from the wording  in  the  Bill\r\n\r\nitself  it  would appear that there  would  be  an\r\n\r\nexpansion of such facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice, Sir, in this Bill before the House\r\n\r\nthat  the  words  \"every\" and \"any\"  are  repeated\r\n\r\nagain  and again.

For instance, clause 4 provides  \"Any\r\n\r\nperson  may  buy a ticket . . .\".  I  suppose  any\r\n\r\nperson  may also sell a ticket. I can imagine  the\r\n\r\nsale of sweepstake tickets not only to adults  but\r\n\r\nalso  to pupils outside school premises. In  spite\r\n\r\nof all that we may say, that our children will not\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  to buy them, we may find that  school\r\n\r\nboys will be buying them and saying to themselves,\r\n\r\n\"Why should we study?
