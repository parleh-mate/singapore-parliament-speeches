Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our FTAs enhance\r\n\r\nSingapore's  attractiveness to investors  and  strengthen\r\n\r\nour  hub  position in Asia.  This is because  the  market\r\n\r\naccess benefits and other preferential treatment that our\r\n\r\nFTAs  carry  will  enhance the exports  of  companies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Singapore companies and foreign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestors  will  find  it more attractive  to  invest  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  thus generating more employment opportunities\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our efforts to ensure that businesses are able to\r\n\r\nbenefit from the FTAs begin well before negotiations  are\r\n\r\nconcluded.   In  the  course  of  the  negotiations,   we\r\n\r\nactively  seek feedback and suggestions from the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  in  order  to find out where the  problems  are.\r\n\r\nArmed  with this information, we are able to negotiate  a\r\n\r\nbetter  agreement for companies.  For the FTAs  that  are\r\n\r\nstill  under negotiation, we strongly encourage companies\r\n\r\nand  business  organisations like the Singapore  Business\r\n\r\nFederation  to  play  an even more active  role  in  this\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once an FTA is concluded, our focus turns to helping\r\n\r\nbusinesses  understand  the   agreement  so  as  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we seek to reach out to the general business\r\n\r\ncommunity  through the media, the Internet and  seminars.\r\n\r\nSuch  large-scale programmes allow us to create a general\r\n\r\nawareness of FTAs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we recognise that a focused approach will be\r\n\r\nmore effective in helping individual companies understand\r\n\r\nhow  they  can  directly  benefit  from  the  Agreements.\r\n\r\nTherefore, our economic agencies have also been in  touch\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore-based  companies  to  see  how  they  can\r\n\r\nspecifically leverage on FTA provisions to gain a greater\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies may not always want to reveal details on\r\n\r\nhow   they   organise  their  operations  to   Government\r\n\r\nagencies.   Instead, they may wish to tap on their  legal\r\n\r\nor  accounting  advisors or other consultants  to  advise\r\n\r\nthem  on  how  to take advantage of the FTAs.   We  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  welcome  efforts by the legal  and  accounting\r\n\r\nprofessions,  as  well  as  management  consultants,   to\r\n\r\ndevelop  capabilities to be able to advise their  clients\r\n\r\non international trade and FTA issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the extent to which Singapore benefits\r\n\r\nfrom these FTAs will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepend   on   our   people  and  businesses.    Singapore\r\n\r\nbusinesses must seize the opportunities afforded  by  our\r\n\r\nFTAs to grow and expand internationally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Singapore workers must be prepared\r\n\r\nto  retrain  and  prepare  themselves  for  the  new  job\r\n\r\nopportunities  that will be created as a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nFTAs.  The FTAs will not help us to hold on to jobs  that\r\n\r\nare  no  longer competitive, whether in the manufacturing\r\n\r\nor services sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers can take advantage of MOM's retraining\r\n\r\nschemes,   such  as  the  WorkSkills  Training  Programme\r\n\r\n(WSTP), the Self Employment Training Programme (SET), the\r\n\r\nStrategic  Manpower Conversion Programme (SMCP)  and  the\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment Programme (SRP).  Retrenched banking\r\n\r\nsector employees who are subsequently re-employed in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  sector,  can  also  take  advantage  of   MAS'\r\n\r\nFinancial  Sector  Development  Fund  Financial  Training\r\n\r\nScheme to upgrade their technical expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We encourage workers and unions to look to the new\r\n\r\nopportunities provided by the FTAs, and take advantage of\r\n\r\nthe  resources  provided  by the  Government  to  prepare\r\n\r\nthemselves well for these opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, can the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State kindly enlighten how we can  actually\r\n\r\nexplain  this whole concept and programme of the FTAs  to\r\n\r\nthe  man-in-the-street because, according  to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  statement a few days back, about 20,000  jobs\r\n\r\ncan be created arising from the FTAs and especially so in\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing and service sectors?  There  are  many\r\n\r\npeople  who are finding hope in this announcement and  if\r\n\r\nmore could be done to communicate and make it more simple\r\n\r\nto the man-in-the-street, it will help a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> I think that is a good\r\n\r\npoint.   We  have been doing a fair bit to publicise  the\r\n\r\nFTAs.   First, of course, the full text of  the  FTAs  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the business guides are all posted on the  MTI's\r\n\r\nwebsite.

Another  approach\r\n\r\nwill be to work with the unions so that they get a better\r\n\r\nawareness  of  the specific opportunities that  the  FTAs\r\n\r\nprovide for workers in their sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

For  next year, we are forecasting  2.0  -  5.0%,\r\n\r\nalthough there is considerable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuncertainty  because of the state of the  global  economy\r\n\r\nand the possibility of war in Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growth forecast for this year reflects\r\n\r\nexpectations of continued positive growth in  the  fourth\r\n\r\nquarter on a year-on-year basis, in other words, compared\r\n\r\nto  the fourth quarter of last year.  This is because our\r\n\r\nkey  exports  markets  are  still  growing,  albeit  more\r\n\r\nslowly.   However, should GDP contract on  a  quarter-on-quarter basis in the fourth quarter, as happened  in  the\r\n\r\nthird quarter, we will technically be in recession. We do\r\n\r\nnot  expect  this to happen, but we cannot rule  out  the\r\n\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an environment as uncertain as today's, there can\r\n\r\nbe little certainty in short term economic forecasts.  If\r\n\r\nUS  consumption  does  not fall  sharply  in  the  fourth\r\n\r\nquarter, and the major economies do not stumble badly, we\r\n\r\nshould  be  able  to  achieve positive quarter-on-quarter\r\n\r\ngrowth  in  the  fourth  quarter and  avoid  a  technical\r\n\r\nrecession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's economic performance next year will also\r\n\r\ndepend very much on how various external events pan  out.\r\n\r\nWe could see a good recovery in the economy in the second\r\n\r\nhalf  of  2003 if the US has by then worked  through  the\r\n\r\nafter-effects of the investment bubble of the late 1990s,\r\n\r\nand if confidence in the region around us is sustained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned in this House last month, several of\r\n\r\nthe  measures  the  Government implemented  in  July  and\r\n\r\nOctober last year to help companies during this difficult\r\n\r\nperiod  are  still in place.  These include JTC  and  HDB\r\n\r\nrental  rebates,  the cut in foreign  workers'  levy  and\r\n\r\nconcessions  on port dues. We have also made enhancements\r\n\r\nto  the  Local  Enterprise  Technical  Assistance  Scheme\r\n\r\n(LETAS) and the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also introduced other schemes aimed at\r\n\r\nhelping SMEs.  SPRING Singapore launched a Loan Insurance\r\n\r\nScheme  (LIS) in September 2002 to complement  the  Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise Financial Scheme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(LEFS),  and  help SMEs get better access  to  financing.\r\n\r\nUnlike LEFS, which stipulates a fixed interest rate,  LIS\r\n\r\ngives    participating   financial    institutions    the\r\n\r\nflexibility to decide on interest rates according to  the\r\n\r\nrisk  profile of the borrower. This increases the  chance\r\n\r\nof  success of an SME's loan application. Private  credit\r\n\r\nrisk  insurers  insure 50 per cent of  the  loan  against\r\n\r\ndefault.  The  Government  co-shares  the  cost  of   the\r\n\r\ninsurance premium with the SME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Micro Loan Programme was also set up in November\r\n\r\nlast  year,  to provide easier access to loans  for  very\r\n\r\nsmall  enterprises to meet their working  capital  needs.\r\n\r\nSince  its  launch  in November last year,  almost  1,000\r\n\r\nfirms have benefited from this scheme with a total of $32\r\n\r\nmillion in loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Government has also implemented\r\n\r\nreductions  in corporate income taxes, and postponed  the\r\n\r\nrestoration  of  the CPF contribution rates.  These  will\r\n\r\nhelp all businesses during this difficult period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is monitoring the economy closely. It\r\n\r\nis looking at whether some of the earlier economic relief\r\n\r\nmeasures need to be extended, and whether additional ways\r\n\r\nto  help  businesses and workers tide over the  difficult\r\n\r\nperiod are necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\ngiven the economic uncertainty and the fact that we  have\r\n\r\nbeen told that there might be even a double-dip recession\r\n\r\nnext year, would not the Government consider, as part  of\r\n\r\nits strategy, a postponement of the proposed increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  GST hike scheduled for January next year?  Given the\r\n\r\nfact  that the unemployment situation is set to  increase\r\n\r\nfurther  in  the coming weeks or months, that people  are\r\n\r\nalready  tightening  their belts and will  tighten  their\r\n\r\nbelts  even  further  and therefore consumption  spending\r\n\r\nwill drop and businesses will suffer, and this would lead\r\n\r\nto  a  contraction  in the economy in the  months  ahead,\r\n\r\nwould he not consider such a move?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a\r\n\r\ndouble-dip recession cannot be ruled out but  it  is  not\r\n\r\nlikely  at this stage.  There are some economists in  the\r\n\r\nUS  who have painted a scenario of a double-dip in the US\r\n\r\nbut  the majority opinion remains that of positive growth\r\n\r\nin the US economy.  Likewise for the region around us and\r\n\r\nthe  global economy.  So we cannot rule it out but it  is\r\n\r\nnot  a central scenario at this point, not something that\r\n\r\nwe  attach high likelihood to.  We will have to watch the\r\n\r\neconomy  very carefully in the coming months and  respond\r\n\r\naccordingly.    Likewise,  for  unemployment.    We   are\r\n\r\nwatching  it  very carefully but it is  not  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere we expect a sharp surge in unemployment figures  at\r\n\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has mentioned publicly yesterday\r\n\r\nthat the manner of implementation of the GST increase  is\r\n\r\nbeing considered.  This is being looked at together  with\r\n\r\nvarious other economic relief measures, whether we should\r\n\r\nextend  some  of  the earlier economic  relief  measures.\r\n\r\nThis  is  being  considered very  carefully.   There  are\r\n\r\nobviously  revenue implications.  I should  clarify  that\r\n\r\nthe  existing plan, as it stood, was not a contractionary\r\n\r\nplan  because  the GST increase was accompanied  by  very\r\n\r\nsubstantial  offset  measures,  including  the   Economic\r\n\r\nRestructuring Shares that would actually have meant a net\r\n\r\nboost  in the amount of funds being put into the  economy\r\n\r\nby  the  Government.   It was actually,  on  balance,  an\r\n\r\nexpansionary   package.   But  having  said   that,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  considering very carefully  the  mode  of\r\n\r\nimplementation of the GST increase, bearing in  mind  the\r\n\r\neconomic difficulties of businesses and workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HDB AND JTC COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Rentals)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  if his Ministry will consider extending  the\r\n\r\nrental rebates and deferring the rental increases or  the\r\n\r\nupward  adjustments to 'market rental'  of  HDB  and  JTC\r\n\r\ncommercial   properties  until  the  economic   situation\r\n\r\nimproves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, existing rental rebates\r\n\r\nprovided by HDB to its commercial tenants will expire  at\r\n\r\nthe   end  of  the  year.

As  Singapore   has\r\n\r\nalready achieved many years of religious harmony, I think\r\n\r\nthe   Code,  when  it  is  completed,  will  look  rather\r\n\r\nfamiliar. However, it is still useful to remind ourselves\r\n\r\nof all these basic principles which have helped, and will\r\n\r\ncontinue to help, achieve and maintain religious  harmony\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Code is actually a reflection of\r\n\r\nmoral  values  and social norms.  It is not  a  piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation.   Hence, there will be no penalties  if  the\r\n\r\nCode is flouted.  If someone acts in such a manner as  to\r\n\r\nviolate  religious harmony, there are existing mechanisms\r\n\r\nto  deal with them, and it will not be dealt with by  the\r\n\r\nCode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, under the Maintenance of Religious\r\n\r\nHarmony  Act, the Minister for Home Affairs is  empowered\r\n\r\nto  issue  restraining orders of up to a maximum  of  two\r\n\r\nyears against persons inciting religious misunderstanding\r\n\r\nor  causing  inter-religious hostility.  Any  person  who\r\n\r\nbreaches the restraining order shall be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nguilty  of  an offence and be liable on conviction  to  a\r\n\r\nfine  not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding two years or to both.  In the  case  of  a\r\n\r\nsecond  or subsequent offence, the person will be  liable\r\n\r\nto a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for  a\r\n\r\nterm  not exceeding three years or to both.  The Act also\r\n\r\nprovides for the establishment of a Presidential  Council\r\n\r\nfor Religious Harmony.  The Chairman and every member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Council are appointed by the President on the advice\r\n\r\nof  the  Presidential Council for Minority Rights  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod of three years.  The Council considers and reports\r\n\r\nto the Minister for Home Affairs on matters affecting the\r\n\r\nreligious harmony in Singapore which are referred to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil by the Minister or by Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has proposed a draft Code on\r\n\r\nReligious Harmony for discussion.  And since I have  been\r\n\r\nappointed to head the Working Group on the Code,  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen consulting with the national groups representing the\r\n\r\nvarious  faiths  in order to develop the Code,  and  this\r\n\r\nprocess will take place in the next few months.   I  will\r\n\r\nlisten  to  and,  as  far  as possible,  incorporate  all\r\n\r\nrelevant  views.   The  Code  will  be  referred  to  the\r\n\r\nPresidential   Council   for   Religious   Harmony    for\r\n\r\nconsideration before it is finalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the elaborate consultation process, I hope\r\n\r\nthe  finalised Code would be one that all major religions\r\n\r\nin  Singapore can agree with and feel ownership for,  and\r\n\r\none   that   can   be  understood  and  internalised   by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  in what manner would  this  Code  be\r\n\r\npractised.  Is there a consideration to integrate  it  as\r\n\r\npart  of  the pledge-taking session, or are we  going  to\r\n\r\nhave a separate session?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, through the\r\n\r\nconsultation  process,  we hope to  achieve  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhereby the various religious groups consider the Code as\r\n\r\ntheir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCode,  and not the Government's Code.  And if the various\r\n\r\nreligious  groups consider the final Code as their  Code,\r\n\r\nwe  can  discuss in what manner they could  remind  their\r\n\r\nbelievers  of  this  Code.  I have actually  exposed  the\r\n\r\npreliminary idea to them that, for example,  if  all  the\r\n\r\nreligious  groups agree, we can say that  for  the  first\r\n\r\nweek  of  every month, at the end of their weekly prayer,\r\n\r\nthe  Code  can  be read out to the devotees or  followers\r\n\r\njust  to remind the people.  But all these are very, very\r\n\r\npreliminary at the moment.  I maintain that what we  want\r\n\r\nto  achieve  is  for  the  various  religious  groups  to\r\n\r\nconsider  the Code as their Code, and that they  take  it\r\n\r\nupon themselves to remind their believers and devotees of\r\n\r\ntheir Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Based on what the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  has  just described, it will really take  care  of\r\n\r\ncitizens with a religion.  But in cases where they do not\r\n\r\nhave a religion, they will not have a place of worship to\r\n\r\npractise such an oath-taking.  So eventually when we have\r\n\r\nthis  objective  of coming up with the Religious  Harmony\r\n\r\nCode,  how  do we intend actually to cover  the  rest  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who may not have a religion at this point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I think it will depend on the\r\n\r\ncontent  of the Code, whether it addresses everybody,  or\r\n\r\nit addresses people who are practising a religion.  If we\r\n\r\nare  talking about addressing everybody, there is already\r\n\r\na  code  which  is in our National Pledge  that  all  our\r\n\r\nstudents read every day where we pledge ourselves as  one\r\n\r\nunited  people regardless of race, language or  religion,\r\n\r\nand  so on.  But for those who are practising a religion,\r\n\r\nif  the  Code  is  to  remind them  that  when  they  are\r\n\r\npractising a religion and when this goes into the  common\r\n\r\nspace, when they are interacting with people of different\r\n\r\nfaiths,  what  is the understanding between  our  various\r\n\r\nreligious  groups on how we should handle  that  kind  of\r\n\r\nsituation.  If the Code is to address that, then I  would\r\n\r\nsay  it  suffices to remind the people who  are  actively\r\n\r\npractising their religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> From what the Minister of State\r\n\r\nhas  just described, would he not think that it may  lead\r\n\r\nto  a lot of confusion in the sense that we are going  to\r\n\r\nhave two sets of Codes, one in the school and another set\r\n\r\njust basically for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  religious  groups?

We are in the consultation  process\r\n\r\nand  we  would like the various religious groups to  play\r\n\r\ntheir part in formulating the Code and to play their part\r\n\r\nto  remind  their  followers  on  the  Code  and  how  to\r\n\r\ninternalise  the Code.  Since the process  is  still  on-going, I cannot presuppose what would the turnout  be  at\r\n\r\nthe  end.   But  if we are talking about Singaporeans  in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  my  own view is that there is  already  a  code\r\n\r\ncalled  the  National  Pledge.  But  for  those  who  are\r\n\r\npractising  their religion actively and bearing  in  mind\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore is a multi-religious type of society,  we\r\n\r\nwant  to practise a faith in such a way that it does  not\r\n\r\ncreate  misunderstanding or, worse still, create  offence\r\n\r\nwith  each other.  What I was saying is that if the  Code\r\n\r\naddresses  this situation, then to be able to remind  the\r\n\r\npeople  who are actively practising their religion  would\r\n\r\nhave been well-served by this Code.

But  they  have\r\n\r\nnothing  to  do  with  the  self-help  groups'  role   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-help groups were set up to help the\r\n\r\nunderachievers  in their community to  level  up.   While\r\n\r\nnational   programmes  and  CDCs  can   cater   to   most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, the self-help groups are more effective  in\r\n\r\nreaching  out to the last 5% that need help, given  their\r\n\r\ncultural   affinity,  language  and  networks.  Moreover,\r\n\r\ndifferent   communities  have  different  priorities   to\r\n\r\naddress.   A  community  self-help approach  allows  each\r\n\r\ncommunity  to focus on the issues and problems  that  are\r\n\r\nmost pressing for that community.  The existence of self-help groups should not be perceived as a weakness but  as\r\n\r\ncomplementary to our multi-racial approach.  If the multi-racial  approach was not well accepted, we would  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  form self-help groups without creating communal\r\n\r\ntension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-help groups recognise that their programmes\r\n\r\nshould promote and not undermine multi-racialism.   Where\r\n\r\nfeasible,  they  pool their resources and organise  joint\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   For example, the students  can  now  attend\r\n\r\ntuition classes run by any of the self-help groups island-wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-help groups are governed by boards of\r\n\r\nmanagement and overseen by MCDS.

The development of the Chinese\r\n\r\nhubs  will  also bring about further downstream  economic\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  Singapore, eg,  in  the  maintenance,\r\n\r\nrepairs and overhaul sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to how Changi Airport\r\n\r\nintends to stay ahead of its competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globally, the aviation industry has yet to fully\r\n\r\nrecover  from  the economic downturn exacerbated  by  the\r\n\r\nSeptember 11 events.  Regionally, competition has  become\r\n\r\nmore  intense, with many airports offering new facilities\r\n\r\nand larger capacities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this backdrop of continued uncertainty in\r\n\r\nthe  global  aviation  industry and intensifying  airport\r\n\r\ncompetition,  my Ministry has embarked on  a  fundamental\r\n\r\nreview of Changi Airport's competitive strategy.  What we\r\n\r\naim  to do is to not just help our airline partners  tide\r\n\r\nthrough  this  difficult  period but,  more  importantly,\r\n\r\nposition Singapore for the long haul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore happy to inform Members of the\r\n\r\nsetting up of a 3-year, S$210 million Air Hub Development\r\n\r\nFund  (AHDF)  as  part  of our competitive  strategy.   A\r\n\r\nnumber  of  initiatives will be launched under the  AHDF.\r\n\r\nThese will be targeted at our industry partners, and help\r\n\r\nus  further  anchor  Changi's  position  as  the  premier\r\n\r\nregional air hub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, CAAS will, under the AHDF, step up\r\n\r\ncollaboration   with  airlines  and  various   Government\r\n\r\nagencies,  like the Singapore Tourism Board,  on  traffic\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes.  Fundamentally, the most critical\r\n\r\nelement for an airline is the demand for air travel.   If\r\n\r\nwe  can  stimulate  greater demand  for  air  travel  to,\r\n\r\nthrough  and from Singapore, the business of the airlines\r\n\r\nwill  improve, margins will increase, and they  will  not\r\n\r\nonly stay, but increase their presence here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also enhance our existing cost reduction\r\n\r\nmeasures  under the AHDF.  The House may recall  that  as\r\n\r\npart  of  the Government's Off-Budget measures in October\r\n\r\n2001, we had introduced a 10% landing fee discount and  a\r\n\r\n15%  rental discount.  With effect from 1st January 2003,\r\n\r\nwe  will  increase  the  landing fee  discount  from  the\r\n\r\ncurrent 10% to 15%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will generate savings for the airlines of about S$30\r\n\r\nmillion  annually for the next three years.  In addition,\r\n\r\nthe current 15% rental discount will also be extended for\r\n\r\nanother  three  years.  This will benefit  not  only  our\r\n\r\ntenants  at the passenger terminals but also our  tenants\r\n\r\nat the Changi Airfreight Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CAAS will announce more details of the AHDF,\r\n\r\nand   all   these   measures  will  help  Changi   remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive as a key aviation hub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> In view of the fact that cost is\r\n\r\na  big  consideration in the airline business,  does  the\r\n\r\nMinister  think that it is viable for Singapore  to  look\r\n\r\ninto the possibility of setting up a no-frills airline?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as the CAAS has replied in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers  a  few days ago, we  would  welcome  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of an additional airline in Singapore, whether\r\n\r\nit is a low-cost carrier or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BUKIT PANJANG LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Service disruption)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b> asked the Minister for Transport\r\n\r\n(a)  whether he will give an update on the status of  the\r\n\r\nservice  level  of the Bukit Panjang Light Rail  Transit;\r\n\r\n(b)  what were the causes of the major service disruption\r\n\r\non  21st  October 2002; and (c) what measures  are  being\r\n\r\nundertaken to prevent recurrence of the same problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Transport\r\n\r\n(a)  whether  he  will consider shutting down  the  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  LRT system for a period of time so as to conduct\r\n\r\na  thorough investigation and testing of the system;  and\r\n\r\n(b)   what  are  the  key  safety  features  of  and  the\r\n\r\nperformance standards specified for the LRT system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan) (for the Minister for Transport):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  with your permission, I would like to take Question\r\n\r\nNos. 8 and 9 together, please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Until the service disruption on\r\n\r\n21st October 2002, the Bukit Panjang LRT had overcome its\r\n\r\ninitial  difficulties and has begun to meet  our  service\r\n\r\nexpectations.   In the four months preceding  the  recent\r\n\r\nincident, it had met the service availability standard of\r\n\r\n99.7%,  ie, a delay of not more than 4 minutes over  each\r\n\r\n20-hour operating period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 21st October service disruption occurred at\r\n\r\naround  6.40 am.  Service was partially restored on  24th\r\n\r\nOctober.   Full  service resumed on 26th October.   While\r\n\r\nthe incident caused commuters a lot of inconvenience,  at\r\n\r\nno time was safety of commuters compromised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Each LRT vehicle has eight guide-wheels to help position the vehicle centrally on its\r\n\r\ntrack.   Guide-wheels  are not the same  as  the  running\r\n\r\nwheels  on  which the vehicle travels.  On 21st  October,\r\n\r\none of the eight guide-wheels got dislodged and fell off.\r\n\r\nThe  spindle that held the guide-wheel grated against the\r\n\r\nrail,  damaging  about one kilometre  of  it  before  the\r\n\r\nvehicle  came to a stop.  SLRT had to replace the damaged\r\n\r\nportions of the rail.  It was a major repair, and it took\r\n\r\nthem several days to complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after the incident, the Land Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority  directed  SMRT,  the  parent  company  of  the\r\n\r\noperator,  to  set  up a Panel of Inquiry.   The  Panel's\r\n\r\nfindings  were released just last week.  Let me highlight\r\n\r\nthe key points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, why did the guide-wheel drop off? A guide-wheel is normally held in place by a castle nut and a\r\n\r\ncotter pin.  A cotter pin is about five centimetres  long\r\n\r\nand  is  inserted  through a castle nut  to  prevent  the\r\n\r\ncastle nut from loosening as a result of vibration.    It\r\n\r\nis  an  important component of the guide-wheel  assembly.\r\n\r\nWithout  the cotter pin to hold it in place,  the  castle\r\n\r\nnut  may turn loose and, in extreme cases, can result  in\r\n\r\nthe guide-wheel falling off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the incident, SMRT and SLRT staff searched the\r\n\r\nentire  site.  They could retrieve all the components  of\r\n\r\nthe guide-wheel assembly, but not the cotter pin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  has led the Panel to conclude that the most  likely\r\n\r\ncause  for the guide-wheel to be dislodged was a  missing\r\n\r\ncotter pin in the guide-wheel assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the second question was: why was the cotter pin\r\n\r\nmissing?  The Panel considered the possibility of the pin\r\n\r\nbreaking or dropping off through wear and tear.   But  it\r\n\r\nruled  out such a possibility as neither the pin nor  its\r\n\r\nbroken  parts  were recovered.  The Panel concluded  that\r\n\r\nthe  cotter  pin was probably never inserted  during  the\r\n\r\nlast  overhaul  maintenance in August  2002,  two  months\r\n\r\nbefore the incident.   This is despite the fact that  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance procedure does require the maintenance  staff\r\n\r\nto  sign off after inserting the pin, and the maintenance\r\n\r\nrecord did contain their signatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This finding would suggest to me that the quality of\r\n\r\npreventive maintenance is not up to the mark.  First, the\r\n\r\nfailure  to insert the cotter pin, an important component\r\n\r\nof  the  guide-wheel assembly, should have been noted  at\r\n\r\nthe time of the overhaul in August.  Second, daily checks\r\n\r\nfor excessive free play of the guide-wheel assembly by an\r\n\r\nexperienced team could have detected the loosening of the\r\n\r\nguide-wheel before it became completely dislodged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this incident, there are several\r\n\r\nactions being done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, LTA is conducting an audit of the maintenance\r\n\r\nregime  of  the BPLRT.  The objective is to identify  the\r\n\r\nshortcomings so that they can be corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, SMRT and SLRT will follow through the\r\n\r\nvarious  recommendations put up by the Panel of  Inquiry.\r\n\r\nThese  were technical matters and were already  announced\r\n\r\nby  the Panel last week.  I would not repeat them, except\r\n\r\nto highlight one key recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel has recommended that SMRT and SLRT should\r\n\r\nwork  closer together in cross-training their maintenance\r\n\r\nstaff  so that they can reinforce each other in the event\r\n\r\nof  any  major  service disruption.  This will  speed  up\r\n\r\nservice recovery and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nminimise  inconvenience to commuters.   This  is  a  good\r\n\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I see value in integrating and centralising\r\n\r\nthe  maintenance functions of SMRT and SLRT,  to  achieve\r\n\r\neconomy  of  scale  and,  more  importantly,  in  raising\r\n\r\nprofessionalism of the maintenance team at the LRT level.\r\n\r\nBut  this  is  really  an  operational  matter  that  the\r\n\r\noperator should think through and decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo proposed that the BPLRT be shut down for a\r\n\r\nperiod  so that a thorough investigation and testing  can\r\n\r\nbe carried out.  But this is not necessary. This incident\r\n\r\nis not due to a flaw in design.  Neither does it point to\r\n\r\na  safety  risk.  It is caused by a lapse in maintenance.\r\n\r\nIt  is human error.  The way forward is to tighten up  on\r\n\r\nmaintenance and to prevent such human errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked about the key safety features and\r\n\r\nperformance standards that we impose on the LRT.  Let  me\r\n\r\nassure  Dr  Teo that the BPLRT is safe.  It has  adequate\r\n\r\nsafety  features, and one example is the Automatic  Train\r\n\r\nProtection  System  that regulates the  distance  between\r\n\r\ntrains to prevent any collision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for performance standards, they are set out in\r\n\r\nfull  in the Licence and Operating Agreement between  LTA\r\n\r\nand  SLRT.   They relate to service quality,  safety  and\r\n\r\noperations of the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the disappointment of Members and\r\n\r\ncommuters  affected by this latest disruption.  But  this\r\n\r\nrecent  incident  is  not quite similar  to  the  earlier\r\n\r\nproblems.  The earlier teething problems of the LRT  have\r\n\r\nbeen  largely  resolved.  That is  why  it  was  able  to\r\n\r\nachieve 99.7% service level for several months.  This did\r\n\r\nnot  happen  by  chance.  I know that SMRT  has  seconded\r\n\r\nsignificant engineering resources to SLRT and has engaged\r\n\r\nBombardier,  the  train supplier,  to  provide  technical\r\n\r\ntraining.  As a result, the maintenance standard  of  the\r\n\r\noperator  has  improved significantly in  recent  months.\r\n\r\nBut  the  21st October incident shows that it  still  has\r\n\r\nsome way to go.  We will continue to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npress   the   operator  to  improve   its   standard   of\r\n\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> I would like to ask the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister of State whether there are any specific  reasons\r\n\r\nfor  the less than satisfactory performance and vigilance\r\n\r\nof the maintenance team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> As I have said, it has to do with\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  maintenance.  I  have  been  very  much\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  looking at this project over the  last  few\r\n\r\nmonths since our last Budget debate, and I have seen  the\r\n\r\nquality  improving.   It is quite a different  team  now.\r\n\r\nThey are serious about what they are doing.  But like all\r\n\r\nthings,  it cannot be fixed overnight.  Until the October\r\n\r\n21st  incident,  indeed, the quality has  improved.  They\r\n\r\nhave  put in significant engineering resources, at  great\r\n\r\ncost,  from the parent company into the subsidiary.   But\r\n\r\nthe  October 21st incident shows that they are not  quite\r\n\r\nthere yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own take-away is this. I have been involved in\r\n\r\nrunning hospitals for many years and was helping Minister\r\n\r\nYeo  Cheow Tong at that time in restructuring the various\r\n\r\nhospitals.   Initially,  when  we  started  restructuring\r\n\r\nhospitals   and   splitting  them  up   into   individual\r\n\r\nhospitals,  the immediate reaction was to go  independent\r\n\r\non  everything - maintenance was split up, PR, HR,  CFOs,\r\n\r\nand  so  on - all decentralised. And what was the result?\r\n\r\nThe  result  was  that  for  large  hospitals,  like  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  General  Hospital or the  National  University\r\n\r\nHospital  which  I  was running at that  time,  they  had\r\n\r\nenough  critical  mass.  They were able to  accumulate  a\r\n\r\nvery professional team.  But it was the smaller hospitals\r\n\r\nthat   suffered  because  of  their  lack  of  scale   of\r\n\r\noperation.  They were not able to recruit a giant team as\r\n\r\nthey needed to, as in the large hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own observation about this whole BPLRT incident\r\n\r\nis  this.  As they split up into SMRT running the  larger\r\n\r\nsystem  and,  inevitably, you have a  much  smaller  team\r\n\r\nrunning SLRT.  With a smaller team, it is not just budget\r\n\r\nconstraint,  but also career development for  the  staff.\r\n\r\nIt  is harder to recruit top maintenance staff.  In fact,\r\n\r\nI was at a conference this morning and met the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLRT  management there.  My suggestion to them was:   why\r\n\r\nnot  consider  seriously,  as in  my  own  experience  in\r\n\r\nhospital  management, centralising their  maintenance  so\r\n\r\nthat  they have one team that runs both the MRT and  LRT?\r\n\r\nOf  course, from the financial point of view, we have  to\r\n\r\nsplit  up  and  account their operation separately.   But\r\n\r\nthat  does not prevent us from running certain supportive\r\n\r\noperations  centrally.  And that goes  with  maintenance,\r\n\r\nhuman  resource management, training, etc. That would  be\r\n\r\nmy  advice  to them but, of course, it is a decision  for\r\n\r\nthe company to take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Senior Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  whether  he  could assure the residents  that  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  the Bukit Panjang LRT is safe,  given  the\r\n\r\nfact  that such an important component like a cotter  pin\r\n\r\ncan  go missing despite stringent maintenance procedures.\r\n\r\nHow  could  we  be sure that there are no other  critical\r\n\r\ncomponents  that  affect the safety that  might  also  be\r\n\r\nmissing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my main\r\n\r\nreply, I have assured Members that LRT is safe.

Will the  cost\r\n\r\nbe passed to the commuters in the long run?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on the measurement of 99.7%, is it measured\r\n\r\nover  a  one-month,  three-month or a three-year  period?\r\n\r\nMaybe  the Senior Minister of State can give us the exact\r\n\r\nformula  and  how we measure the performance standard  of\r\n\r\nthe LRT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member has\r\n\r\nasked four questions.  I hope my memory can hold.  Let me\r\n\r\nanswer in reverse order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question was: how is the 99.7% measured?\r\n\r\nAs  I have said, 99.7% is measured on a daily basis.   In\r\n\r\nother words, over a 20-hour operating period - it runs  a\r\n\r\n20-hour operation period - any disruptions, cumulative or\r\n\r\na single incident, cannot exceed four minutes.   So it is\r\n\r\na very, very stringent service level.  And the system has\r\n\r\nbeen   able  to  deliver  that  until  the  October  21st\r\n\r\nincident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question was on the giant team and the\r\n\r\ncost of maintenance and whether it would be passed on.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the cost of maintenance has to be part and  parcel\r\n\r\nof  running the BPLRT system, both the LRT as well as the\r\n\r\nSMRT.  Fare revision is a separate issue and that is  why\r\n\r\nwe have the Public Transport Council (PTC) to review what\r\n\r\nis  the  cost  and  whether there are  justifications  to\r\n\r\nrevise  fares. That is a separate issue altogether.   But\r\n\r\nas  we have always maintained, safety and reliability are\r\n\r\nkey  priorities.   When you provide  a  public  transport\r\n\r\nsystem,  if it is not safe, if it is not reliable,  every\r\n\r\nother  day  it  breaks  down, exceeding  the  four-minute\r\n\r\ndisruption  standard,  it  is  a  terrible  system.   But\r\n\r\nwhatever is the right level of cost, you just have got to\r\n\r\nfloat  up  to that level.  Of course, there is no  reason\r\n\r\nfor us to pad up the maintenance crew so that the cost is\r\n\r\nhigher than necessary.  It is the job of the operator  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that they deliver that level  of  safety  and\r\n\r\nreliability at minimal cost.  And as I have outlined just\r\n\r\nnow, my thinking is, to deliver that optimum level, there\r\n\r\nis  a  case for centralisation rather than splitting  up.\r\n\r\nSplitting up will inevitably raise costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BPLRT has a life of about three years now and I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is useful to break it up into various  stages.\r\n\r\nPeople always criticise the LRT about the 50 disruptions,\r\n\r\nmuch  of it were teething problems in the earlier period.\r\n\r\nIf  you  look  at this year's performance record,  it  is\r\n\r\nquite different.  We were not responsible for the earlier\r\n\r\nopening  of the BPLRT.  If you ask me, as an engineer,  I\r\n\r\nwould have preferred to test the system thoroughly before\r\n\r\nwe  opened  it up because, like all complicated  systems,\r\n\r\nthere  will be problems.  There are bound to be  teething\r\n\r\nproblems.   For  example, the Esplanade  has  roofs  that\r\n\r\nleak.   When I opened hospitals, I remember that for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  six months, we have to fix several leaking  roofs.\r\n\r\nThis is normal for any sophisticated project.  And for  a\r\n\r\npublic  utility like transport, my preference would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  to:   test, test and test again, until we are  very\r\n\r\nsure,  then we open it.  And that is the approach we  are\r\n\r\ntaking  to the Sengkang LRT and that will be the approach\r\n\r\nwe are taking to the North-East line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hindsight, perhaps BPLRT should not have been\r\n\r\nopened  prematurely.  If they had done that, I think  all\r\n\r\nthose  50 disruptions probably would have happened during\r\n\r\nthe trial period rather than when the system was open for\r\n\r\nrevenue service.  Anyway, that is history now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more important is to focus on the way going\r\n\r\nforward.   My point is this.  Until the October incident,\r\n\r\nfor  four months, they have been able to deliver  on  the\r\n\r\nvery  high standard of 99.7%.  Let us not demoralise  the\r\n\r\nexisting  management team.  They are working  their  guts\r\n\r\nout.  I know because I have seen them working.  They  are\r\n\r\nserious  people.   I  think they are not  proud  of  what\r\n\r\nhappened  on  October 21st.  The lapses could  have  been\r\n\r\navoided  and I think resources will now be pumped  in  to\r\n\r\nmake sure that those mistakes do not crop up again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the scope of audit by LRT? It will be as\r\n\r\nwide  as necessary.  The key question to answer is:   are\r\n\r\nthere  faults  in  the  maintenance  regime?   Are  there\r\n\r\nshortcomings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  which  can  be  fixed?   Preliminary,  looking  at\r\n\r\nthings,   for   example,  looking  at  this   guide-wheel\r\n\r\nincident, the procedures are correctly worded.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nbecause  cotter  pin  is  such  an  important  piece   of\r\n\r\ncomponent,  the  SOP  in  the  maintenance  requires  two\r\n\r\nsignatures  - the one who inserts the pin signs  it  off;\r\n\r\nthe  one who supervises it signs it off.  Both signatures\r\n\r\nwere  there.  But what happened?  We discovered that  the\r\n\r\none  who supervised, the second signature, did it without\r\n\r\nactually looking at it.  That is bad and that has  to  be\r\n\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that there is any design problem.\r\n\r\nThis  is not the first time Bombardier installed an  LRT.\r\n\r\nThere  have  been many Bombardier systems all around  the\r\n\r\nworld.   I do not think we can say that that was a design\r\n\r\nproblem.  I did make a comment when I toured BPLRT that I\r\n\r\nwould  have  preferred not to retrofit  an  LRT  into  an\r\n\r\nexisting  town  because I have travelled on  BPLRT.   Two\r\n\r\nweeks  ago, I took a trial run on the Sengkang LRT.   The\r\n\r\nSengkang LRT is planned and built together with  the  new\r\n\r\ntown.   When  you do so, you get a simpler  system.   The\r\n\r\ntracks  are by and large, level.  Whereas if you  take  a\r\n\r\nride on our BPLRT, not quite a Disneyland roller coaster,\r\n\r\nyou get ups and downs, twists and turns.  As an engineer,\r\n\r\nI  know that such twists and turns, ups and downs exert a\r\n\r\nlot  of stresses on the system.  It causes much more wear\r\n\r\nand  tear.   It does not mean that it cannot be  made  to\r\n\r\nwork,  but  it means that your maintenance must  be  top-class.   If  your  maintenance  is  not  top-class,  then\r\n\r\noccasionally,  there will be lapses and disruptions  crop\r\n\r\nup.  Having built the system and run it, let us now focus\r\n\r\non  the operation and make sure that maintenance is  top-class.  Today, it is not quite there yet but there is  no\r\n\r\nreason  why  they cannot achieve top-class  if  they  put\r\n\r\ntheir hearts and souls into it and we intend to make sure\r\n\r\nthat they do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard\r\n\r\nthe Senior Minister of State confirm that the most likely\r\n\r\ncause  is  due to a maintenance lapse.

This is because those in the low income  groups\r\n\r\nmay  worry  about not being able to sustain  the  premium\r\n\r\npayments, while those in the high income groups may  have\r\n\r\nother alternatives to take care of their care expenses in\r\n\r\nthe  event of severe disabilities.

First, Singaporeans may  not  understand\r\n\r\nfully  the  benefit of risk pooling and a pure  insurance\r\n\r\nscheme,  without  death benefits or a savings  investment\r\n\r\nfeature.  Many may perceive it as money down the drain if\r\n\r\nthey  eventually  do  not  get  to  claim  the  benefits.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is precisely what insurance is all about  - you buy protection but hope that you would not be unlucky\r\n\r\nenough to claim it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans may also have opted out because\r\n\r\nthey  think  ElderShield does not offer  good  value  for\r\n\r\nmoney.    They  may  have  underestimated  the  risk   of\r\n\r\ndisability  because  our population  is  still  generally\r\n\r\nyoung   today.   They  may  also  not  have  taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  feature that  once  you  have  joined\r\n\r\nElderShield,  the premiums do not increase as  one  grows\r\n\r\nolder, and coverage is for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the ElderShield is run by the private\r\n\r\nsector.   Some Singaporeans may have preferred  that  the\r\n\r\nscheme  be administered by the Government.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  highlight  that  ElderShield is awarded  to  the  two\r\n\r\nprivate  insurers - NTUC Income and GE Life  Insurance  - through competitive tendering process.  The Ministry  has\r\n\r\nalso  put  in  place a framework on premium  rebates  and\r\n\r\nlimits  on  premium  adjustments based  on  actual  claim\r\n\r\nexperiences to safeguard the interests of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ElderShield is one of the many schemes that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has put in place to help Singaporeans pay  for\r\n\r\ntheir  healthcare  costs.  For the low-income  group  who\r\n\r\nhave opted out, they would be helped through other means.\r\n\r\nVWO  residential step-down care facilities are affordable\r\n\r\nas they are subsidised, with charges at between $300-$500\r\n\r\na  month,  after  50-75% subsidy from  Government.   Low-income   Singaporeans  who  still   cannot   afford   the\r\n\r\nsubsidised   charges  will  be  eligible   for   Medifund\r\n\r\nassistance through the step down care providers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, the immediate task of the Ministry\r\n\r\nand  the  ElderShield insurers is to  ensure  the  smooth\r\n\r\noperation of the scheme and that it serves the  needs  of\r\n\r\nthe policyholders.  The scheme has just rolled out.  When\r\n\r\nwe  have  gained sufficient experience on the scheme,  we\r\n\r\nwill work with the ElderShield insurers to offer enhanced\r\n\r\nbenefits  such as higher monthly payouts or payouts  over\r\n\r\nlonger periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have opted out, the deadline for\r\n\r\nopting-back into ElderShield has been extended to the end\r\n\r\nof  this  year.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, Singapore did\r\n\r\nnot tender any reservation to Article 10 of UN CEDAW,  as\r\n\r\nequal   access  to  education  is  one  of  the  cardinal\r\n\r\nprinciples in the Singapore education system.  Women made\r\n\r\nup  52.5% of the local university population in the  2001\r\n\r\nintake.  But equal access to education does not mean that\r\n\r\nevery  student has a free choice as to the type of course\r\n\r\nhe or she may pursue.  It depends on the number of places\r\n\r\navailable  for  each  course, which depends  on  national\r\n\r\nneeds and the cost of providing different courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of training a medical student is five times\r\n\r\nhigher than that for other disciplines in the university.\r\n\r\nIt costs over $400,000 over five years to train a medical\r\n\r\nstudent,  80%  of which is subsidised by the  Government.\r\n\r\nThis means a relatively higher investment by taxpayers in\r\n\r\nmedical education compared to other disciplines.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has imposed a quota  on  the  intake  of\r\n\r\nfemale medical students wishing to study medicine in  NUS\r\n\r\nas,  comparatively, more female doctors tend to leave the\r\n\r\nworkforce prematurely or switch to part-time work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not regard this policy a violation of our\r\n\r\nobligations  under the CEDAW, within the overall  context\r\n\r\nof  our  health care and education systems in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nas:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) There is no quota on the number of female\r\n\r\ndoctors allowed to practise medicine in Singapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) There are no discriminatory practices against\r\n\r\nfemale  doctors in our health care organisations.

Mr Speaker, Sir, our\r\n\r\nunemployment  rate  rose to 4.8% in September  2002,  the\r\n\r\nlast quarter.  This was the highest level for the past 15\r\n\r\nyears.  Sir, unemployment is projected to rise to as high\r\n\r\nas  5.5%  by  the  end of this year.   Our  economic  and\r\n\r\nemployment  outlook  for the next six  months  is  rather\r\n\r\nuncertain.   It is therefore critical for the  Government\r\n\r\nto strike a judicious balance between meeting businesses'\r\n\r\nneeds for low-wage foreign workers and helping unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to find jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the foreign worker levy was already lowered on\r\n\r\n1st  January 1999.  The reduction was $70 for the skilled\r\n\r\nforeign workers and $90 for the unskilled foreign workers\r\n\r\nin  the  manufacturing and services sectors.  The reduced\r\n\r\nlevies  will  remain in force until December  2002.   The\r\n\r\ncurrent  lower-tier  levy of $30 is already  a  very  big\r\n\r\nconcession  to  help  employers  keep  costs  down.   The\r\n\r\noutcome  of  my  Ministry's review on the foreign  worker\r\n\r\nlevy  will  be  announced in early  December  before  the\r\n\r\ncurrent moratorium expires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our key challenge now is to re-deploy the\r\n\r\nunemployed and the retrenched workers to industries where\r\n\r\nthere  are opportunities for gainful employment.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore unwise and not in the interest of Singapore  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  dependency  ceiling or  to  allow  more  non-traditional  sources workers into our  labour  market  at\r\n\r\nthis juncture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should focus on retraining and re-orientating\r\n\r\ndisplaced workers for current and imminent job vacancies.\r\n\r\nFor  employers,  the present slack labour  market  offers\r\n\r\ngood opportunities to recruit local workers so as to meet\r\n\r\ntheir  manpower  needs  and to  enable  them  to  recruit\r\n\r\nadditional   work  permit  holders  under   the   current\r\n\r\ndependency ceiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nfact  that we have a very high unemployment rate  now  of\r\n\r\n4.8%, I would like to ask the Minister what mechanism  is\r\n\r\nin  place right now in the Ministry before approving  any\r\n\r\nwork  permit  applications, to ensure that the  employers\r\n\r\nactually exhaust all possibilities in recruiting local\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployees who are Singaporean workers first?  I feel that\r\n\r\nthere  could be a possibility that there could be  abuse,\r\n\r\nin the sense that employers look to foreign workers as an\r\n\r\neasy  alternative, instead of exhausting all avenues  and\r\n\r\npossibilities, in terms of trying to redesign work, or in\r\n\r\nterms  of  trying to retrain workers before resorting  to\r\n\r\nforeign workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we now have two\r\n\r\ncontrary  views  or opinions on this situation.   I  just\r\n\r\nlike to remind hon. Members that what I said was that  we\r\n\r\nshould  strike a judicious balance.  We should not  shift\r\n\r\nfrom  one  end  of the spectrum to the  other  end.   The\r\n\r\nMember's  proposal that we apply labour market  test,  in\r\n\r\nother words, we make sure that the employer has conducted\r\n\r\nproper recruitment exercise and has offered similar  jobs\r\n\r\nto Singaporeans and these offers were turned down, before\r\n\r\nwe  approve  the work permit application.   This  is  one\r\n\r\npossibility.   Some countries do implement labour  market\r\n\r\ntest.   But in our context, if we introduce labour market\r\n\r\ntest, we would increase the rigidity in our labour market\r\n\r\nand  I think that is not good for us because, on the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  while  we have rising unemployment, on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  many  of  our industries are still actually  quite\r\n\r\ndependent  on  some  percentages  of  lower-wage  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers to maintain their competitiveness.  Our companies\r\n\r\nhave to survive in the global market and if we force them\r\n\r\nto  employ  higher-wage workers, then we might  seriously\r\n\r\ncripple their ability to compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while unemployment has gone up, we should not\r\n\r\nswing   too  far  towards  trying  to  protect  displaced\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  What we should do, as I have said,  is  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them, equip them with the skills so that  they  can\r\n\r\ntake  on  the  new  jobs  that are  available,  and  also\r\n\r\nencourage employers to give them an opportunity.  So as I\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier  on that in the light of our  slack  labour\r\n\r\nmarket,  it  is an opportunity for employers  to  recruit\r\n\r\nmore  Singaporeans.  And, if they have more  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthen they can recruit more work permit holders under  our\r\n\r\npresent dependency ceiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to elaborate that this is a serious\r\n\r\ninvitation  to  employers  because  the  Government   has\r\n\r\noffered   through   the  People  for   Jobs   Traineeship\r\n\r\nProgramme, a wage subsidy for up to six months or a limit\r\n\r\nof  50%  of the first six months' salary, up to $2,000  a\r\n\r\nmonth, for employers to recruit Singaporean workers  aged\r\n\r\n40  and  above.   If  you do so, we give  you  this  wage\r\n\r\nsubsidy, and on top of it you can recruit another foreign\r\n\r\nworker  in  the manufacturing sector under the dependency\r\n\r\nceiling  of  50%.   So  it is a win-win  situation.   You\r\n\r\nrecruit  a Singaporean and you get an additional  foreign\r\n\r\nworker.   Overall, it averages downwards your wage  cost.\r\n\r\nSo  I  would  urge  employers to take advantage  of  this\r\n\r\nscheme  to  reach  out to the unemployed Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\ngive them a chance, to help them to make this adjustment,\r\n\r\nrather  than  to just look towards getting  more  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers, getting more non-traditional source workers,  or\r\n\r\nto ask Government to further lower the levy.  At $30, the\r\n\r\nlevy is almost practically nothing.  It is already such a\r\n\r\ngenerous  concession.  How much lower can we go?   Cancel\r\n\r\nthe   levy  completely?   I  think  that  would  be  most\r\n\r\nunreasonable,  and I think that could be very  disruptive\r\n\r\nto our own resident labour market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Mr Speaker, given that\r\n\r\nGovernment has been doing all these things to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans  are  trained  and  available  to   be\r\n\r\nemployed,  what  is the problem faced by SMEs  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  all  these  difficulties attracting local  workers?\r\n\r\nHas MOM done anything to study what are the problems that\r\n\r\nSMEs  are  facing  because we have all these  schemes  in\r\n\r\nplace?

Old jobs that they have  lost\r\n\r\nare  unlikely to come back and new jobs would require new\r\n\r\nskill-set, which they must make an effort to acquire, and\r\n\r\nin  order  to  fit into these new jobs they may  have  to\r\n\r\nstart  lower down the ladder from where they were before,\r\n\r\nbecause  they have now moved to a new industry,  doing  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  kind  of work.  So there are quite  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nadjustments  that are needed, both on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nworker,  the  person looking for a job, and also  on  the\r\n\r\npart of the employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also helping companies, particularly SMEs, to\r\n\r\nlook   into  how  they  can  restructure  their  business\r\n\r\noperations.  One thing that the employers need to  do  is\r\n\r\nto look into how to improve the productivity of the jobs.\r\n\r\nIf  he has a job, if the job can be re-engineered into  a\r\n\r\nmore  productive  job, then he could  obviously  offer  a\r\n\r\nhigher salary to the worker and still remain competitive.\r\n\r\nIf  he  continues to do business in the old  way,  in  an\r\n\r\nunproductive manner, then his wages would be  constrained\r\n\r\nby  his low level of productivity and he will not be able\r\n\r\nto offer wages that can attract more Singaporeans to take\r\n\r\nup  this job.  One thing that employers have to do is  to\r\n\r\ntake  a  hard  look at their business operation  and,  if\r\n\r\npossible,  restructure their business so  that  they  can\r\n\r\noffer  more value-added and more productive jobs  to  job\r\n\r\nseekers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Under  the new  one-tier  corporate  tax\r\n\r\nsystem,  tax will only be imposed at the corporate  level\r\n\r\nand  any dividends paid by the company will be tax-exempt\r\n\r\nin  the  hands of its shareholders.  The flow-through  of\r\n\r\nexempt   dividends  will  be  for  unlimited   tiers   of\r\n\r\nshareholders  with no minimum shareholdings  requirement.\r\n\r\nAs  an anti-avoidance measure, preference dividends  paid\r\n\r\nout  of exempt income currently subject to tax under  the\r\n\r\nimputation system will be deemed as interest and so  will\r\n\r\nbe  taxable.   In  addition,  dividend  franking  credits\r\n\r\navailable during the 5-year transitional period  for  the\r\n\r\nchange  in  the tax system and exempt dividends  will  be\r\n\r\ncapped in proportion to the shareholder's shareholding in\r\n\r\nthe dividend paying company.

In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  personal income  tax  structure  will  be\r\n\r\nsimplified by consolidating the existing 10 bands  to  7.\r\n\r\nThis  will take effect from the Year of Assessment  2003.\r\n\r\nClauses  34  and  63 amend the Act to provide  for  these\r\n\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n) To attract talent to relocate to Singapore and\r\n\r\nuse  it  as  a base for regional activities, as  well  as\r\n\r\ncreate  favourable conditions for Singaporeans  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  away  for  some time to re-establish themselves  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, special tax treatment will be given  to  these\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  classified  as  `not ordinarily  resident'  or\r\n\r\n`NOR' taxpayers.  An NOR taxpayer will be exempt from tax\r\n\r\non  income earned before he came to Singapore and on  his\r\n\r\nemployer's contribution to his overseas pension fund.  In\r\n\r\naddition, an NOR taxpayer who spends at least 90  days  a\r\n\r\nyear  outside Singapore on business will pay tax only  on\r\n\r\nhis  Singapore employment income, based on the number  of\r\n\r\ndays  he spends here.

The current Act already provides  stamp\r\n\r\nduty  relief for property that is transferred to a newly-wedded  couple  by  their  family  as  a  wedding   gift.\r\n\r\nHowever, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconditions to qualify for this relief are not specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 16 of the Act by\r\n\r\ninserting a new section 16(3A) to specify that the relief\r\n\r\nis  only granted for the transfer of property to a  party\r\n\r\nto  the marriage.  The property must be transferred  from\r\n\r\ntheir  spouse  or a parent, grandparent or sibling  of  a\r\n\r\nparty  to  the marriage.  In addition, the transfer  must\r\n\r\ntake  place  within one year of the date of solemnisation\r\n\r\nof  the  marriage, and the property must be used  as  the\r\n\r\nmatrimonial home of the couple.  These conditions are put\r\n\r\nin place to ensure that the transfer represents a genuine\r\n\r\ngift to the couple for their marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Stamp duty on disposal and re-issue of shares</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, no stamp duty is levied on the\r\n\r\ncancellation  and  issue  of  shares.   Thus,  a  company\r\n\r\nintending  to sell existing shares to a buyer  may  avoid\r\n\r\nincurring  stamp  duty  by  cancelling  existing   shares\r\n\r\nfollowed with an allotment and issue of new shares to the\r\n\r\nsame  purchaser for a consideration.  Clause 5 will close\r\n\r\nthis loophole by amending section 33 of the Act to impose\r\n\r\none set of stamp duty on a document that effects such  an\r\n\r\narrangement to cancel and re-issue shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Limiting   stamp  duty  exemption  only  to  co-operative societies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, section 36(e) exempts instruments\r\n\r\nexecuted  by or on behalf of co-operative societies  from\r\n\r\nstamp   duty,  if  the  underlying  transaction  in   the\r\n\r\ninstrument relates solely to the business of the society.\r\n\r\nBoth  the  co-operative society and the party  it  enters\r\n\r\ninto a contract with are exempted from stamp duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current laws, parties entering into such\r\n\r\ncommercial agreements with co-operatives would  stand  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  stamp duty exemption.  There  is  no  good\r\n\r\nreason for parties transacting with the co-operatives  to\r\n\r\nenjoy the exemption from stamp duty, as they have entered\r\n\r\ninto   the   agreement   based   on   purely   commercial\r\n\r\nconsiderations.  Thus, clause 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namends  section 36(e) of the Act to limit  the  exemption\r\n\r\nfrom  stamp duty only to co-operative societies, and  not\r\n\r\nto extend it to the parties transacting with co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Objections to the Commissioner's assessment</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, objections to the Commissioner's\r\n\r\nassessment  under  section 37 of the  Act  must  be  made\r\n\r\nwithin  30 days.  Section 16(3) of the Act also  empowers\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner to impose an additional dutiable amount\r\n\r\nwhen he assesses that the consideration is far lower than\r\n\r\nthe  market value.  However, there is no finality to  the\r\n\r\ntime  period  within which a taxpayer can object  to  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner's assessment under section 37.  As such,  it\r\n\r\nis possible for a taxpayer to dispute the assessment many\r\n\r\nyears after the assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 39A(1) such that any\r\n\r\nobjection   to  the  Commissioner's  assessment   of   an\r\n\r\nadditional dutiable amount must be made within  30  days.\r\n\r\nThe  30-day  time  period is the same as  that  currently\r\n\r\nprovided  in the Income Tax Act for a taxpayer  to  raise\r\n\r\nany objections to the assessment of income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Levying two sets of Stamp Duty on exchanges of properties</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, for an exchange of properties, only one\r\n\r\nset  of stamp duty is payable, based on the property with\r\n\r\nthe  higher value.  However, a transaction involving  the\r\n\r\nexchange  of  properties between two  parties  should  be\r\n\r\ntreated  as  two transactions involving two parties  each\r\n\r\nbuying  and selling a property at the same time.   Hence,\r\n\r\nan  exchange of properties should be levied with two sets\r\n\r\nof stamp duty.  Clause 9 amends the First Schedule of the\r\n\r\nAct to effect this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Stamp  duty  on  distribution of assets  in  specie  upon liquidation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 also amends the First Schedule of the Act\r\n\r\nsuch  that  if a person becomes a shareholder only  after\r\n\r\nwinding-up proceedings have commenced, he would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharged  ad  valorem duty on the transfer  of  shares  or\r\n\r\nproperties  instead  of  a  fixed  duty  of  $10.    This\r\n\r\namendment will prevent opportunistic attempts to  acquire\r\n\r\nthe liquidating company's assets with minimal stamp duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS (FINALITY AND NETTING) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.28 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Payment and Settlement Systems (Finality and\r\n\r\nNetting)  Bill seeks to make provision for the protection\r\n\r\nof  payment and settlement systems from disruptions  that\r\n\r\nmay  lead  to  risks  in  the financial  system.   Proper\r\n\r\nprotection  of such systems is critical to the  effective\r\n\r\nfunctioning   of   the  financial   system.    The   Bill\r\n\r\nstrengthens  the  legal environment for operating  stable\r\n\r\nand  secure  payment and settlement systems by empowering\r\n\r\nthe  Monetary  Authority of Singapore (MAS) to  designate\r\n\r\npayment and settlement systems.  These designated systems\r\n\r\nwill  be  exempted from the application of certain  legal\r\n\r\nrules,  including  the  rule in insolvency  law  for  the\r\n\r\nunwinding of certain types of transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go into the Bill proper, let me first\r\n\r\ngive  some  background  on the importance  of  protecting\r\n\r\npayment and settlement systems from disruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Importance  of protecting payment and settlement  systems from disruptions</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment and settlement systems consist of sets of\r\n\r\ninstruments,   banking  procedures  and  funds   transfer\r\n\r\nsystems  that ensure the circulation of money.  They  are\r\n\r\ntherefore  an  important part of the market and  economic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.  However, payment and settlement  systems\r\n\r\nalso  provide  a  channel for shocks  to  be  transmitted\r\n\r\nacross  financial  markets.  This is especially  true  in\r\n\r\nlarge  value  inter-bank payment and  settlement  systems\r\n\r\nthat  are systemic in nature, where one disruption  could\r\n\r\ntrigger  or transmit further disruptions to the financial\r\n\r\nsystem.   Take,  for instance, MEPS, the Real-Time  Gross\r\n\r\nSettlement  system operated by the MAS for the settlement\r\n\r\nof  funds between banks.  In 2001, MEPS processed a total\r\n\r\nof  $11.6  trillion of payments; this was  more  than  75\r\n\r\ntimes the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Singapore  over\r\n\r\nthe  same  year.  Clearly, any disruption  to  the  sound\r\n\r\noperation  of  MEPS  would have a significant  impact  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's  financial  system.  Therefore,  payment  and\r\n\r\nsettlement systems with systemic implications  like  MEPS\r\n\r\nmust have a robust architecture, well-planned contingency\r\n\r\narrangements,  proper  operational procedures  and  clear\r\n\r\nrules for participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is equally important for these payment and\r\n\r\nsettlement  systems  to have a sound  legal  basis.   The\r\n\r\nrules,  regulations  and  agreements  relevant  to   such\r\n\r\nsystems  must  be  legally enforceable.   In  particular,\r\n\r\ntransactions  that  have  already  been  settled  by  the\r\n\r\nsystems should be final and irrevocable, and must not  be\r\n\r\nunwound  or  otherwise adjusted by any legal proceedings.\r\n\r\nAny  netting  arrangements in the payment and  settlement\r\n\r\nsystems  should  likewise  be  enforceable.   While   the\r\n\r\npayment  and  settlement systems should have  contractual\r\n\r\narrangements  and  rules  in  place  to  set  out   these\r\n\r\nprovisions,  existing laws can operate to override  them.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, the law of insolvency allows a  liquidator\r\n\r\nof  an  insolvent corporation to reverse, or  \"claw-back\"\r\n\r\npayment  transactions that have already been  settled  if\r\n\r\nthese  transactions are deemed to be unfair  or  to  have\r\n\r\nbeen made at a significant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nundervalue.  Such claw-back provisions are based  on  the\r\n\r\ngeneral principle that favours the equal distribution  of\r\n\r\nassets  to  the  creditors of an  insolvent  corporation.\r\n\r\nThis  principle  must, however, be balanced  against  the\r\n\r\ndisruption that might be caused to payment and settlement\r\n\r\nsystems  and  to  the participants if  it  applies  to  a\r\n\r\ndisposition made through these systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore a strong case for the law to\r\n\r\nrecognise the importance of the integrity and finality of\r\n\r\ntransactions  in  payment  and  settlement   systems   in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  financial  stability  and  for  the  law  to\r\n\r\nprotect  these systems from the legal risks that  I  have\r\n\r\njust  outlined.   The legislatures in countries  such  as\r\n\r\nAustralia,  the United States of America, Canada  and  in\r\n\r\nmany  European  countries have  already  taken  steps  to\r\n\r\naddress   these   legal   risks   by   enacting   similar\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhancing Singapore's Legal Framework to Protect Designated System</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, section 59A of the Banking Act has\r\n\r\nprovided   for   the   finality  and  irrevocability   of\r\n\r\ntransactions  made  through MEPS  since  1998.   However,\r\n\r\nsection  59A  is  not wide enough to  cover  payment  and\r\n\r\nsettlement systems that are not operated by MAS.  We  are\r\n\r\nan  important international financial centre.   With  the\r\n\r\ncontinuing advancement of technology, greater competition\r\n\r\nand  increased  scale  and  sophistication  of  financial\r\n\r\nplayers, there will be new payment and settlement systems\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  that  require the same  legal  protection.\r\n\r\nThe Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system is one such\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Continuous Linked Settlement system is a global\r\n\r\npayment and settlement system that aims to reduce foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  (FX) settlement risk.   Launched  in  September\r\n\r\nthis   year,   with  the  participation  of  over   sixty\r\n\r\ninternational banks and seven major currencies,  CLS  has\r\n\r\nalready  reached  a  daily  settlement  value  of  US$300\r\n\r\nbillion  and it is expected eventually to settle a  large\r\n\r\npercentage  of  the US$1.2 trillion a day global  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange market.

The three local  banks  in\r\n\r\nSingapore have established the capability to join CLS  as\r\n\r\nparticipants  in December 2002.  As one  of  the  largest\r\n\r\nforeign   exchange   trading  centres   in   the   world,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  participation  in  CLS  will  reinforce  our\r\n\r\nposition as a key node in the global financial system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Payment and Settlement Systems (Finality and\r\n\r\nNetting)  Bill  will provide an omnibus solution  to  the\r\n\r\nlegal  risks  that surround the operation of payment  and\r\n\r\nsettlement  systems  by  according  legal  protection  to\r\n\r\nsystems that are designated by MAS.  It will allow us  to\r\n\r\nprovide for the integrity and finality of transactions in\r\n\r\nsystems  such as MEPS and CLS, as well as any new payment\r\n\r\nand  settlement  systems that may be  introduced  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now highlight the major provisions that\r\n\r\nare being introduced in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Major Provisions in the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 gives MAS the power to designate payment\r\n\r\nand   settlement  systems  to  provide  them   with   the\r\n\r\nprotection offered under this Bill.  Clause 4  gives  MAS\r\n\r\nthe   power   to  revoke  the  designation   in   certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   In determining whether  to  designate  a\r\n\r\nsystem,  MAS will take into account a number of  factors,\r\n\r\nin  particular  the systemic risks associated  with  that\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill sets out the protection that is\r\n\r\naccorded  to  transactions effected through a  designated\r\n\r\nsystem  when a participant in that designated  system  is\r\n\r\nbankrupt, in judicial management or winding up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, clause 7 gives statutory backing to any\r\n\r\nrule  of  the  designated system that  provides  for  the\r\n\r\nfinality  of fund transfers into and out of the  accounts\r\n\r\nof  participants, as well as the finality of transactions\r\n\r\nsettled in the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 8 provides that the regime\r\n\r\nestablished  by the rules of a designated  system  is  to\r\n\r\ntake  precedence  over the insolvency  law  principle  of\r\n\r\nequal and pro-rated distribution of assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 10 then go on to make clear that the\r\n\r\nlegal   provisions  providing  for  the  \"claw-back\"   of\r\n\r\ntransactions  that are unfair preferences or transactions\r\n\r\nat  an  undervalue,  and other like provisions,  are  not\r\n\r\napplicable  to transactions effected through a designated\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 gives effect to the default arrangements\r\n\r\nthat  are provided in the rules of the designated  system\r\n\r\nand  provides that only the net sum, following completion\r\n\r\nof  action taken under the default arrangements, shall be\r\n\r\nprovable or payable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 establishes the end-date for the\r\n\r\nprotection  accorded  by Part II.  Transactions  effected\r\n\r\nafter the date the participant goes into insolvency  will\r\n\r\nnot have the benefit of the protection under Part II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part III of the Bill, clause 13 makes netting\r\n\r\navailable  to  a  designated system where  a  participant\r\n\r\nbecomes insolvent.  In such a situation, the operator  of\r\n\r\nthe designated system may net all obligations owed to  or\r\n\r\nby  the  participant incurred before or on the  date  the\r\n\r\nparticipant  goes into insolvency, with the  result  that\r\n\r\nonly the net sum shall be provable or payable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 fortifies the position by providing that a\r\n\r\ncourt in Singapore is not to recognise or give effect  to\r\n\r\nan  order  from a foreign court in so far as  that  order\r\n\r\nwould be contrary to the provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 clarifies that the protection accorded by\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  will not affect the rights of persons  arising\r\n\r\nfrom the underlying transaction or under the general law.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, if a person had made a payment to  another\r\n\r\nby  mistake, and this mistaken payment was routed through\r\n\r\na  designated  system by banks that were participants  in\r\n\r\nthe  designated  system,  the  person  who  received  the\r\n\r\npayment  would  not  be immune from a legal  action  that\r\n\r\nmight  be available to the payer for the recovery of  the\r\n\r\nmistaken  payment.  The Bill is intended to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nunwinding of transactions made through a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesignated  system.   It  is  not  intended   to   accord\r\n\r\nadditional  legal protection or benefit to the  recipient\r\n\r\nat the end of the payment chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the protection given by the Bill will only apply\r\n\r\nto  transactions entered into a designated system  before\r\n\r\nor on the day a participant becomes insolvent, the system\r\n\r\nshould not accept any transactions from a participant  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as  it  has  notification that the participant  has\r\n\r\nbecome insolvent.   To facilitate this, clause 16 of  the\r\n\r\nBill  imposes  an obligation on the participant  that  is\r\n\r\ninsolvent to give notice of that fact to the operator  of\r\n\r\nthe designated system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 protects MAS and its officers from\r\n\r\nliability  in  connection with any action taken  in  good\r\n\r\nfaith in MAS' capacity as the designating authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 empowers MAS to make regulations for\r\n\r\ncarrying out the purpose and provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of the Bill, MEPS will be a\r\n\r\ndesignated system and clause 19 accordingly provides  for\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 deals with the migration of the current\r\n\r\nsection  59A of the Banking Act to the Monetary Authority\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  Act.    It  is more  appropriate  for  the\r\n\r\nstatutory provision relating to the operation by  MAS  of\r\n\r\nreal-time gross settlement systems such as MEPS to be  in\r\n\r\nthe  MAS Act.  This will also make it possible to  extend\r\n\r\nparticipation in such real-time gross settlement  systems\r\n\r\nto  institutions other than banks.  Accordingly,  section\r\n\r\n59A of the Banking Act will be repealed and a new section\r\n\r\n29A will be inserted into the MAS Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the Bill provides the broad\r\n\r\nlegal foundations for the operation of stable payment and\r\n\r\nsettlement systems, thereby reducing the risk of systemic\r\n\r\ndisruptions  to  Singapore's financial system.   This  is\r\n\r\nessential for Singapore's competitiveness and development\r\n\r\nas a major financial centre in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEMS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Rapid Transit System (RTS) has expanded over the\r\n\r\nyears.  In 1987 when we started, we had less than  70  km\r\n\r\nof  network.  With the opening of the Woodlands extension\r\n\r\nin  1996,  the Bukit Panjang LRT in 1999 and  the  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport  extension this year, the network is  now  nearly\r\n\r\n100 km long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Northeast Line (NEL) opens next year, the\r\n\r\nnetwork will further expand to about 120 km.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, changes have also taken place in the\r\n\r\nindustry.   The SMRT Corporation, the holding company  of\r\n\r\nSMRT  Ltd (SMRT) which operates the existing MRT network,\r\n\r\nwas  listed  in 2000.  SBS Transit Ltd, another  publicly\r\n\r\nlisted company, will be operating the NEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current licensing and regulatory framework for\r\n\r\nrapid  transit systems must keep pace with these  changes\r\n\r\nso  that  it  remains  relevant in the  light  of  actual\r\n\r\nexperience.   This  is  the reason for  introducing  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will empower the Land Transport Authority\r\n\r\n(LTA),  the  industry  regulator, to  impose  conditions,\r\n\r\nrestrictions  and performance standards on rapid  transit\r\n\r\nlicensees,   both   existing  and   future,   through   a\r\n\r\nlegislative framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  imposition  of  these conditions,  restrictions  and\r\n\r\nperformance  standards  on  the  licensee  is  not   new.\r\n\r\nCurrently, they are provided in the Licence and Operating\r\n\r\nAgreement  negotiated between LTA and the licensee.  What\r\n\r\nthis Bill will allow us to do is to put these conditions,\r\n\r\nrestrictions  and performance standards on a  legislative\r\n\r\nfooting.  In this way, we achieve greater transparency in\r\n\r\nour regulatory framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the two key provisions in the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 2</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 15 of the Act to\r\n\r\nempower the LTA to impose:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) conditions on its licensees on matters relating\r\n\r\nto corporate governance;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) restrictions on the licensees' involvement in\r\n\r\nnon-public transport businesses; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) standards on the licensees' performance in\r\n\r\nareas  such  as the provision of RTS services  and  their\r\n\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has a duty to retain regulatory oversight over\r\n\r\nkey  issues  of  corporate governance and other  business\r\n\r\nactivities   of   its   licensees   because    the    RTS\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  is paid for by public  funds.   Such  LTA\r\n\r\noversight  ensures that the huge capital investments  and\r\n\r\nthe public interest are adequately safeguarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 3</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill expands the statutory powers of\r\n\r\nthe LTA in three areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it empowers the LTA to issue codes of\r\n\r\npractice and directions, under sections 15B and  15C,  in\r\n\r\nareas  such  as  the  operation and  maintenance  of  RTS\r\n\r\nsystems.   This is necessary as changes in  the  industry\r\n\r\nand  advances  in  technology may require  new  codes  of\r\n\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it expands the definition of events of\r\n\r\ndefault  to  include,  among others, non-compliance  with\r\n\r\nCodes of Practice and LTA's Directions (under\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsection  16).   It  also  makes provision  for  financial\r\n\r\npenalties to be imposed in the event of any occurrence of\r\n\r\ndefault.  The ability to impose financial penalties  will\r\n\r\nprovide  LTA with the means to take deterrent  action  if\r\n\r\nthe operators fail to perform to regulatory expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it empowers the LTA (under section 15A) to\r\n\r\nadd,  delete  or  modify the conditions of  the  licences\r\n\r\ngranted  under section 13.  However, any such change  can\r\n\r\nonly  be  effected in accordance with the due process  as\r\n\r\nset  out under this clause.  The proposed amendment  also\r\n\r\nallows  licensees  aggrieved by  the  new  conditions  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to the Minister.  In this connection, the grounds\r\n\r\nof  appeal  by  licensees have also been  expanded  under\r\n\r\nsection 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since its beginning in 1987, our\r\n\r\nRapid  Transit  System has grown to become  an  important\r\n\r\npart  of our public transport system.  It now serves  one\r\n\r\nmillion commuters a day.  When the North East Line opens,\r\n\r\nmore  commuters  will get to benefit from  this  form  of\r\n\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our regulatory regime has to keep pace with\r\n\r\ndevelopments, both in the industry as well as the changes\r\n\r\nin  RTS technology.  In this way, we can better safeguard\r\n\r\nthe   interests   of   the  commuters,   while   ensuring\r\n\r\ntransparency and fairness to the industry players.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  amendment  Bill  on the rapid  transit  systems  is\r\n\r\ntimely and necessary.  As our MRT lines have expanded and\r\n\r\nanother new operator of the North East Line is coming  on\r\n\r\nstream,  it  is  also important to lay  out  and  further\r\n\r\nimprove   the  ground  for  competition  and  performance\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  our  operators.   Performance   related\r\n\r\nindicators  and  codes of practice must  also  comply  in\r\n\r\norder  for  our MRT to operate efficiently.   By  nature,\r\n\r\nthis area of public transport, whether it is for buses or\r\n\r\ntrains, usually\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfalls  into  some  area  of  natural  monopoly.   It   is\r\n\r\nnecessary to run it both efficiently and yet meet  public\r\n\r\nexpectations of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rule-based competition is important to evaluate\r\n\r\nthe  performance  of the operators.  The  amendment  Bill\r\n\r\nfocuses  on three main areas  -  on the corporate changes\r\n\r\nin  shareholding, on restrictions to lines  of  business,\r\n\r\nand  standards of performance.  While I applaud that such\r\n\r\nconditions   and  restrictions  spelt  out  clearly   for\r\n\r\noperators are good, sometimes it is difficult to see  how\r\n\r\nit  is  applied in practice.  Have we not,  for  example,\r\n\r\nseen the original SBS gone into property development?  On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, if an operator maximises the employment\r\n\r\nof   its   assets  by  properly  going  into  interesting\r\n\r\nbusinesses,    should   it   be   discouraged    in    an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial   and   efficient   economy?    We   must\r\n\r\nappreciate  that  the MRT commands a  sizable  amount  of\r\n\r\nassets  and should be a dynamic sector in creating  value\r\n\r\nin  the economy.  Infrastructural companies operating  on\r\n\r\npublic charter should run their business efficiently with\r\n\r\nthe aim also of serving the public.  Their aim must be to\r\n\r\nmake  a  reasonable return by industrial  comparison  and\r\n\r\nensure that the services are efficient, satisfying public\r\n\r\ndemand and reinvestment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that rules and regulations should be\r\n\r\ntightened  to ensure efficiency to service public  needs,\r\n\r\nthe  LTA  should also determine what are the  performance\r\n\r\nyardsticks  for  monitoring and making  these  yardsticks\r\n\r\nknown  publicly.   They can be the number  of  delays  in\r\n\r\noperations  per year, the number of failures  to  observe\r\n\r\nsafety  regulations, revenue and load  factors,  etc,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  public  will be able to know  how  the  public\r\n\r\nfacility operator is doing.  These red marks must be  the\r\n\r\nbasis to impose fines and penalties on these operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, this proposed amendment only provides for\r\n\r\nthe  penalty  of $1 million on operators for  failure  to\r\n\r\ncomply   with  the  provisions  or  directions   of   the\r\n\r\nAuthority.  It makes no mention of failure to comply  for\r\n\r\nperformances.   I believe operators who fail  to  deliver\r\n\r\nservices  up  to  standard  should  be  given  fines  and\r\n\r\npenalties.  This does not seem to be provided at  all  in\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough  there  is  a provision in  this  Bill  for  the\r\n\r\nAuthority  to  suspend  or  cancel  the  licence  of  the\r\n\r\nlicensee,  it  is hard to envisage what alternatives  the\r\n\r\nAuthority has in cancelling the licence.  After all,  the\r\n\r\ntrains  have  to run.  Hence, I feel that  putting  in  a\r\n\r\nscheme  of  fines  and penalties for  non-performance  or\r\n\r\nfailure is necessary.  This will awake the management  of\r\n\r\nthe   company.   Public  infrastructure  operators   fear\r\n\r\npenalties  and fines more than public outcries.   And  by\r\n\r\nthese  fines,  I  do not mean a fine of $10,000  for  the\r\n\r\nstoppage  of  trains for four days.  The fine  should  be\r\n\r\nmeaningful enough and of sizable amount so as to make  it\r\n\r\na  deterrent for the companies.  The reason for  this  is\r\n\r\nsimple.  For fines, such public infrastructural companies\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  measure the yardstick.   And  for  public\r\n\r\noutcries,  it  is  very hard sometimes to  determine  the\r\n\r\nimpact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will consider this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Chay\r\n\r\nfor  his  comments.   I  take  it  that  he  supports  in\r\n\r\nprinciple  this  Bill.  He made a number  of  points.   I\r\n\r\nnoted three important ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he made a philosophical point. He said, yes,\r\n\r\nwhile he understood the need to place restrictions on non-public  transport activities of licensees, we should  not\r\n\r\ngo overboard and stifle entrepreneurial activities on the\r\n\r\npart  of  licensees.  That I agree.  The  clear  dos  and\r\n\r\ndon'ts   are easy to define, but there will be a  lot  of\r\n\r\ngrey  areas.  So, it is one of those things where  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  to codify.  Therefore, occasionally,  it\r\n\r\nhas  to  be on a case-by-case basis.  And the way  to  go\r\n\r\nabout doing it is to make sure we have wise men and women\r\n\r\nsitting on the board of LTA, so that they can apply their\r\n\r\nwisdom, expertise and experience when a case crops up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point he made was about performance\r\n\r\nyardsticks   -   that  licensees  should  be  subject  to\r\n\r\nmeasurement,   whether   they   meet   up   with    their\r\n\r\nexpectations,  and  he made a point  about  making  those\r\n\r\nindicators  public.  I agree.

In\r\n\r\nfact,  one of the objectives for moving this Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nbuild in this financial penalty framework so that we  can\r\n\r\nhave   a   more  discriminatory  way  of  governing   the\r\n\r\nperformance of the licensees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Khaw Boon Wan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>STRATEGIC GOODS (CONTROL) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.55 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill puts in place an enhanced system to\r\n\r\nregulate  trade  in  strategic goods.   In  broad  terms,\r\n\r\nstrategic goods comprise munitions and sensitive dual use\r\n\r\nitems,  as  well  as  goods used for the  development  or\r\n\r\nproduction of weapons of mass destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore supports the global efforts to curb the\r\n\r\nproliferation  of  weapons of mass  destruction  and  has\r\n\r\nalways maintained high standards in controlling trade  in\r\n\r\nstrategic  goods.  Since the 1970s, we  have  been  state\r\n\r\nparties  to the Biological Weapons Convention (1975)  and\r\n\r\nthe  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (1976).  In  recent\r\n\r\nyears,  we  have ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention\r\n\r\nand the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill strengthens existing controls to keep pace\r\n\r\nwith recent international developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the imperative for the Strategic Goods\r\n\r\n(Control)  Bill?   Mr  Speaker, Sir,  let  me  elaborate.\r\n\r\nRapid  globalisation and technological advancements  have\r\n\r\nspurred  economic  growth, and  stimulated  much  greater\r\n\r\ncross  border flow of goods and people.  But  these  same\r\n\r\nforces  driving  global growth have also  thrown  up  new\r\n\r\nsecurity challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological advances have spawned a range of\r\n\r\nhighly advanced products.  Properly deployed for civilian\r\n\r\nuse,  these  can  improve productivity  and  promote  new\r\n\r\nindustries.   But some of these products  and  technology\r\n\r\ncan  also be deployed for building deadly weapons.  There\r\n\r\nis  also  the  risk of nuclear, biological  and  chemical\r\n\r\nweapons  falling  into  the  wrong  hands.   History  has\r\n\r\nprovided  us  with  cases on the use  of  sarin  gas  and\r\n\r\nanthrax,  and  they  are a sobering confirmation  of  the\r\n\r\nphysical and psychological damage that such chemical  and\r\n\r\nbiological weapons can cause.  Their use makes clear that\r\n\r\nthe threat and risk are real and not just hypothetical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global trade is growing, and the conduits which\r\n\r\ncarry  these  huge  global  flows  of  goods  have   been\r\n\r\nexploited  by  rogue  traders to  smuggle  a  variety  of\r\n\r\nweapons,  including  those  of  mass  destruction.    The\r\n\r\nmethods  used  by  them  to  illicitly  divert  sensitive\r\n\r\nstrategic  goods to proscribed entities have also  become\r\n\r\nmore   sophisticated.   There  is  growing  international\r\n\r\nconcern  in  recent years that such sensitive  goods  and\r\n\r\nweapons could fall into the hands of terrorists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No country alone can tackle this problem. Nor can\r\n\r\nany  country  isolate herself from  the  dangers  of  the\r\n\r\nproliferation of such weapons and components.  More  than\r\n\r\never  before, countries need to work in close partnership\r\n\r\nto  build  a  tight,  effective and efficient  system  of\r\n\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a major trading and logistics centre, Singapore\r\n\r\nmay  be  used  as  a potential conduit for  such  illicit\r\n\r\nactivities. It is in our interest to enhance security  of\r\n\r\nour  ports' operations and to step up vigilance.   It  is\r\n\r\nalso our responsibility, as a member of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninternational community, to play our part in building  an\r\n\r\neffective global system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill represents a comprehensive effort by\r\n\r\nSingapore to plug into international efforts to curb  the\r\n\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the proposed Bill began more than two and a\r\n\r\nhalf  years  ago,  as  we  had assessed  that  proactive,\r\n\r\npreventive actions were necessary.  This was well  before\r\n\r\nthe  world  was shaken by the September 11 attacks.   The\r\n\r\nSeptember  11 attacks brought to the fore the urgency  of\r\n\r\ndealing  with terrorists threats.  In recent  months,  we\r\n\r\narrested  a  total of 36 members of the Jemaah  Islamiyah\r\n\r\nnetwork.  These members were plotting to attack strategic\r\n\r\nlocations  in Singapore.  These recent developments  lent\r\n\r\ngreater   impetus  to  our  efforts  to  take   proactive\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will be the first country in Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia to enhance our controls on strategic goods.  This is\r\n\r\na  strong deterrent measure to prevent rogue traders from\r\n\r\nusing  Singapore to conduct illicit activities.  This  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  pre-emptive  measure  to  tighten  our  domestic\r\n\r\nsecurity.   It will also contribute to enhanced  regional\r\n\r\nsecurity.    A   volatile   and  insecure   neighbourhood\r\n\r\nundermines  investor  confidence.   This  will  have   an\r\n\r\nadverse impact on our regional stability and will  dampen\r\n\r\nour prospects for growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from enhancing our security, our export\r\n\r\ncontrol   system  can  become  a  source  of  competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage for our industries.  With a robust and credible\r\n\r\nsystem  in place, our trading partners will have  greater\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  granting  us  access  to  their  high-end\r\n\r\ntechnology  and  equipment because  they  know  that  any\r\n\r\nshared technologies will remain in safe hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the salient\r\n\r\nfeatures of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will require all traders to apply for a\r\n\r\npermit  before  they are allowed to export,  tranship  or\r\n\r\nbring  into  transit strategic goods  as  listed  in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule to the Bill.  The list comprises about 600\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nitems   by  broad  categories.   It  includes  munitions,\r\n\r\nchemical and biological items, as well as nuclear-related\r\n\r\nmaterials  and  equipment.   These  have  been  carefully\r\n\r\nselected  mainly  for their direct military  and  nuclear\r\n\r\napplications, as well as their dual-use nature (ie,  they\r\n\r\nare  items  which  can  be used  for  both  military  and\r\n\r\ncivilian  purposes).  In drawing up  the  list  of  goods\r\n\r\nunder  control,  we have also referred  to  practices  of\r\n\r\nother  reputable export control regimes in  the  US,  EU,\r\n\r\nJapan and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, beyond the control of physical goods, we\r\n\r\nwill  also  regulate  the  electronic  transmissions   of\r\n\r\nmilitary,  encryption and WMD end-use  technology.   This\r\n\r\nfeature  recognises  the realities  of  the  information-communications  age where the most sensitive  part  of  a\r\n\r\nproduct  may  lie in its software.  The provision  deters\r\n\r\nall  irresponsible handling as well as illicit  transfers\r\n\r\nthat  may potentially undermine our security and  defence\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will also regulate all brokering\r\n\r\nactivities   directly  related  to  WMD   and   offensive\r\n\r\ncategories of conventional arms, such as small  arms  and\r\n\r\nlight  weapons.   The  controls apply  to  all  Singapore\r\n\r\nentities  regardless of whether the goods were physically\r\n\r\ntransferred through Singapore.  We want to send a  strong\r\n\r\nsignal  that  we do not condone the conduct of  any  such\r\n\r\nclandestine activity within our territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, to ensure the continued relevance of our\r\n\r\nenhanced  controls to evolving technologies  and  weapons\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programmes, we have incorporated  a  blanket\r\n\r\ncontrol,  or `catch-all' on all goods that are likely  to\r\n\r\nbe  used for WMD purposes.  This ensures that even  where\r\n\r\nthe item does not fall on the control list, it will still\r\n\r\nbe subject to the controls under this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, we have proposed stiff penalties for non-compliance. The penalties of a maximum $100,000 fine or\r\n\r\n3  times the value of the goods, and/or 2 years' jail for\r\n\r\nfirst  offenders, and a maximum $200,000 fine or 4  times\r\n\r\nthe  value  of  the  goods,  and/or  3  years'  jail  for\r\n\r\nsubsequent offenders, are in line with the Regulation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Imports and Exports Act.  On a case by case basis, we\r\n\r\nwill be prepared to compound minor offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to an important issue - addressing\r\n\r\nbusiness  concerns.   Mr Speaker, Sir,  in  drafting  the\r\n\r\nBill,  the  Ministry  is  very  conscious  that  we  must\r\n\r\nminimise the potential impact on businesses.  Hence, over\r\n\r\nthe   last   two  years,  we  have  conducted   extensive\r\n\r\nconsultations with several hundred companies representing\r\n\r\nthe  key  industries that may be potentially affected  by\r\n\r\nthe   proposed  controls.   Our  industry  has  expressed\r\n\r\nunderstanding and support for the need for such  enhanced\r\n\r\nsecurity.  But they ask that we implement these  measures\r\n\r\nin  a cost-effective and sensible way, and not erode  the\r\n\r\nefficiency   of   our   transportation   and    logistics\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.   Otherwise,  our  competitiveness   will\r\n\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure the House that we have taken,\r\n\r\ntherefore, all necessary steps to address their concerns.\r\n\r\nLet me elaborate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the permit application procedures will be\r\n\r\nsimple,   convenient  and  business-friendly.   We   have\r\n\r\nupgraded  the  TradeNet  system  to  accept  all   permit\r\n\r\napplications.    We   will   process   all   applications\r\n\r\nelectronically.   This will reduce  processing  time  and\r\n\r\nallow for permits to be granted more expeditiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will not impose any additional charges\r\n\r\nfor these permit applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, ground enforcement will be largely based on\r\n\r\nintelligence and risk profiling.  This ensures that cargo\r\n\r\nflows  will  not be impeded by unnecessary  checks.   Our\r\n\r\nrisk profiling system will be similar to those adopted by\r\n\r\nkey ports, such as Rotterdam and Hong Kong.  As our risk-profiling  databases develop over time, the accuracy  and\r\n\r\nspeed  with  which high-risk cargoes are identified  will\r\n\r\nincrease.   This will allow legitimate traders  to  enjoy\r\n\r\neven swifter clearances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, our outreach programme is currently\r\n\r\nongoing.  We want to allay any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerns   that  may  be  generated  by  these   proposed\r\n\r\ncontrols.   We also want to engender a greater  sense  of\r\n\r\nfamiliarity  and instil confidence so that  the  affected\r\n\r\nindustries can adjust and ease into the changes  as  soon\r\n\r\nas  possible.   We  have launched a  website  to  provide\r\n\r\ndetailed information.  Prior to actual implementation, we\r\n\r\nwill  also  conduct  trial runs of the enhanced  TradeNet\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot take peace for granted.\r\n\r\nThe  recent  attacks in Bali are fresh reminders  of  how\r\n\r\nfragile peace and security can be.  The proliferation  of\r\n\r\ndangerous  weapons  threatens  all  countries.   We  need\r\n\r\ngreater international cooperation to safeguard our  local\r\n\r\nsecurity.  The proposed Bill strengthens Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nstrong link in the global chain of anti-terrorism and non-proliferation measures.  It will also serve to  safeguard\r\n\r\nthe  reputation and integrity of Singapore's status as  a\r\n\r\nmajor  international  shipping  hub.   By  securing   our\r\n\r\ntrading  channels,  our cargoes can clear  our  partners'\r\n\r\nports  faster.  We would also generate greater confidence\r\n\r\nin  our  system, and secure greater access  to  high-tech\r\n\r\nequipment  and  technology from more advanced  economies.\r\n\r\nThe  enhanced controls are in our national, economic  and\r\n\r\nsecurity interests.  The proposed Bill is both timely and\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa-Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  thank  you for allowing me to speak on  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the explanations of the Minister of\r\n\r\nState for Trade and Industry, and reading the contents of\r\n\r\nthe Bill, I wish to express my support for this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I take this opportunity to seek a few areas of\r\n\r\nclarification with respect to the general objectives  and\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of these new measures on  control  of\r\n\r\nstrategic goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I support the concept of having a central\r\n\r\nagency  to be the single authority to be responsible  for\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.   However, I notice that the Strategic  Goods\r\n\r\nfor   Control  Items  related  essentially  to  military,\r\n\r\nchemical,  biological  and technology-related  goods  and\r\n\r\nmaterials.  Therefore, in essence, this Bill, in my mind,\r\n\r\nrelates to defence and security items.  So I wish to  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  it is appropriate for this control of  strategic\r\n\r\nmaterials  to  be  vested in the Ministry  of  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  which  is  more interested  in  trade  issues,\r\n\r\nrather  it  should be vested in the defence  or  security\r\n\r\nagencies like the Ministry of Defence, or the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHome Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second area of enquiry is with\r\n\r\nregard  to  whether  the  implementation  of  these   new\r\n\r\nmeasures will hamper the free flow of legitimate  trading\r\n\r\nand  importation  of non-offensive goods  and  materials,\r\n\r\nwhich  are classified within the areas of being strategic\r\n\r\ngoods.  For example, our defence industry, most of  which\r\n\r\nare  Government-owned  in fact, and  they  do  engage  in\r\n\r\nactivities  in  manufacturing and  trading,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nimportation   of   military   and   sensitive   products.\r\n\r\nTherefore would their businesses be affected or  hampered\r\n\r\nin the process?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the private sector's point of view, there are\r\n\r\nalso  many  small and large private companies  which  are\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the transhipment, trading and brokering  of\r\n\r\nstrategic   goods,  such  as  software   and   technology\r\n\r\nproducts.   With these new measures being put  in  place,\r\n\r\nwould  they  be  hampered  or  handicapped  in  terms  of\r\n\r\noperational efficiencies in their businesses?   Will  the\r\n\r\nadditional documentation and procedure controls  lead  to\r\n\r\ndelays and inefficiencies in their brokering business  or\r\n\r\neven  transhipment  business, for the  movement  of  such\r\n\r\nstrategic  goods?  In the process, they may  become  less\r\n\r\ncompetitive against our neighbouring countries  which  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  such kinds of controls.  As the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid, we are the first country in Southeast Asia to  have\r\n\r\nthis form of controls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I conclude by emphasising that\r\n\r\nonce again I do support this Bill, but I wish to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState  whether  he  could  give  an  assurance  that  the\r\n\r\ncarrying  of  legitimate materials would  not  be  unduly\r\n\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> Mr Speaker, I thank Mr\r\n\r\nLeong for his helpful comments and for his support of the\r\n\r\nBill.   I  think we need to put this Bill in perspective.\r\n\r\nIt   does  not  deal  solely  with  security  issues   in\r\n\r\nisolation,  but  the  security aspects  of  a  particular\r\n\r\ncategory of international trade - strategic goods.  In so\r\n\r\nfar  as  it impinges on international trade of goods  and\r\n\r\nservices,    the   economic   considerations    in    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this Bill are just as important.   This\r\n\r\nis  of course what the second part of Mr Leong's question\r\n\r\nrelates  to.  So we need to see which is the best agency,\r\n\r\nthe  most appropriate ministry, in striking this  balance\r\n\r\nbetween our economic and security interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We studied what had been the practice in other\r\n\r\njurisdictions that have export controls.  In  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  and  in  Hong Kong, they are vested  in  economic\r\n\r\nagencies.   We have decided, after careful consideration,\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  vest this in the Ministry  of  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  and  that  the  national  authority  for   the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  export control scheme  should  be  IE\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As the national authority, IE Singapore would\r\n\r\nbe  the  main  point of contact for the  proposed  export\r\n\r\ncontrols scheme.  But it would coordinate with the  other\r\n\r\nrelevant  agencies, including the security agencies.   It\r\n\r\nwould  coordinate with the Customs and Excise Department,\r\n\r\nwith the Police and the DSTA Technical Advisory Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of Mr Leong's question is just as\r\n\r\nimportant.   He asked what are the economic and  business\r\n\r\nimplications  of having an export control regime  scheme.\r\n\r\nThis  concern,  which  he raised,  applies  not  just  to\r\n\r\ndefence  software  technology  companies,  but   to   all\r\n\r\nbusinesses  in Singapore that deal with the  movement  or\r\n\r\ntrade of goods and services.  My Ministry is mindful that\r\n\r\nany  export  control regime would impose  some  costs  to\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   What we have decided to do  is  to  take  a\r\n\r\npractical approach.  There is no point in afflicting upon\r\n\r\nourselves an onerous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem,  if  it  is  not effective.  It neither  benefits\r\n\r\nSingapore,  nor the international community.  Indeed  the\r\n\r\ngoal   of   enhancing  our  security  would  be  severely\r\n\r\nundermined  if  shippers  were  put  off  by  our  strict\r\n\r\ncontrols and chose to divert their cargoes to ports  with\r\n\r\nweaker  control  systems.  Therefore,  the  key  lies  in\r\n\r\nestablishing  an  effective system at a reasonable  cost.\r\n\r\nTo  achieve this, we are building on the strengths of our\r\n\r\ncurrent system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will tap on our already highly efficient\r\n\r\nTradeNet  system to process applications  for  controlled\r\n\r\ngoods.   This  electronic submission process will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat traders continue to enjoy the expeditious processing\r\n\r\nof  the permits as before.  Second, we are enhancing  our\r\n\r\nintelligence  gathering  capabilities.   With  its  risk-profiling   mechanism  and  provisions  for  intelligence\r\n\r\nsharing,  the proposed export control regime will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the efficient and smooth operation of the port will\r\n\r\nnot  be compromised.  Third, the list of controlled items\r\n\r\nhas  been carefully scrutinised to ensure that the  level\r\n\r\nof  regulation is not more onerous than what is necessary\r\n\r\nto achieve our policy objective.  The result is a control\r\n\r\nlist that is not excessively long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a final point\r\n\r\nhere  that  beyond  this limited  cost,  there  are  also\r\n\r\nbenefits  to  Singapore.  One is  that  it  enhances  the\r\n\r\nreputation of Singapore as a secure international trading\r\n\r\nhub.   Two, it would actually help our defence technology\r\n\r\nand  software companies by facilitating their  access  to\r\n\r\ntechnologies in developed economies.  Without  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nthese  companies may find it difficult, as  the  supplier\r\n\r\ncountries  may be concerned that the shared  technologies\r\n\r\nmay  inadvertently fall into the wrong hands.  The  Bill,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  contributes, rather than detracts,  from  the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of our defence and technology companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The\r\n\r\nfoundations were laid in the Goh Keng Swee Report,  which\r\n\r\nwas debated and endorsed by this House in March 1979.  We\r\n\r\nhave  a  well-structured and efficient education  system,\r\n\r\nwhich  allows  every student to go as far as  he  can  in\r\n\r\nachieving  his  potential.  Since 1979, we  have  various\r\n\r\nadaptations  and  improvements to  the  system  so  that,\r\n\r\ntoday,  80%  of  our  students now proceed  on  to  post-secondary  education.   Our  students  do  well  by  most\r\n\r\ninternational comparisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our current JC/upper secondary education system\r\n\r\nhas  served us well.  However, we have to look ahead  and\r\n\r\nprepare ourselves for new challenges, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  move  from an industrial-age economy to a  knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to prepare our students for a more\r\n\r\nunpredictable  and frequently changing environment.   New\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in science and technology will  change  the\r\n\r\nway  we  live, communicate, work and play.  Globalisation\r\n\r\nwill  continue to change and transform economies and  the\r\n\r\nrelations  between  nations.   Knowledge  and  creativity\r\n\r\nwill  be the driving forces that determine whether people\r\n\r\nand countries thrive, or merely struggle to survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be good, not only at efficiently making\r\n\r\nchips  or pharmaceuticals, or trading in stocks and other\r\n\r\nfinancial instruments; but we must also be able to create\r\n\r\nnew  products whether they be gene chips, a new  drug  to\r\n\r\ntreat  a  disease,  a  digital movie,  or  new  financial\r\n\r\ninstruments and services.  Singaporeans must  be  willing\r\n\r\nto   take   calculated  risks,  to   create   their   own\r\n\r\nopportunities, to search out new niches and markets, even\r\n\r\nin the world of existing technologies and products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prepare our young for this new future, education\r\n\r\nneeds to move away from an industrial model of production\r\n\r\nwhich  worked  well  in the past when  things  were  more\r\n\r\norganised, stable and bounded by convention.  But this no\r\n\r\nlonger  reflects the world we live in.  In the globalised\r\n\r\nworld,   there   are   fewer  certainties   and   greater\r\n\r\nvariability.   To  prepare our people,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  has been making changes in this  direction  in\r\n\r\nthe last five years. We have:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Trimmed down our curriculum content to give\r\n\r\nmore  emphasis  to process skills and learning  to  apply\r\n\r\nknowledge;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Introduced IT to encourage independent learning\r\n\r\nand  to reach beyond the classroom to the wider world  to\r\n\r\nexpand the horizons of learning;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Encouraged multi-disciplinary learning,\r\n\r\nteamwork and new ideas through project work;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Introduced new assessment methods such as open\r\n\r\nbook   and   source-based   questions,   and   continuous\r\n\r\nassessment for `A' level practical; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Given greater recognition to achievements\r\n\r\nbeyond  the academic by counting co-curricular activities\r\n\r\nfor entry to university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever,  such changes have been carried out  within  the\r\n\r\ncurrent structure of our education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when the Ministry of Education embarked\r\n\r\non  this review, the aim was to make a departure from the\r\n\r\ncurrent  structure,  to  open  up  the  system  to   more\r\n\r\nflexibility and diversity in curricula and structure, and\r\n\r\nto  provide more avenues for our students with  different\r\n\r\nstrengths and interests to develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes proposed for the JC/upper secondary\r\n\r\neducation  are major and substantive, and will  make  our\r\n\r\nsystem  a less uniform one.  Fundamental changes will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced in two areas - we will have a more broad-based\r\n\r\nand  flexibly structured JC curriculum, and more  diverse\r\n\r\nstructures  and  mix of schools in the  system.   I  will\r\n\r\nelaborate  on  each  of  these  further.   But  before  I\r\n\r\nproceed,  let me just record my thanks to Senior Minister\r\n\r\nof  State,  Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, and his  Committee\r\n\r\nfor  having done a very good job in reviewing the  system\r\n\r\nand making these proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>A Broader and More Flexible JC Curriculum</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new JC curriculum will do more to nurture the\r\n\r\nskills,  outlook and habits required for success  in  the\r\n\r\nknowledge age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current JC curriculum has its strengths. The\r\n\r\n`A'  levels  have served as the standard  bearer  of  the\r\n\r\nrigour and high standards of our pre-university education\r\n\r\nfor  the last 30 years.  The programme is challenging and\r\n\r\nprovides  students  with a strong core  of  knowledge  in\r\n\r\ntheir chosen fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the JC curriculum in its current form - consisting of a narrow selection of specialised `A' level\r\n\r\nsubjects - may not be adequate to prepare our JC students\r\n\r\nfor a future that places a premium on flexibility and  an\r\n\r\nability  to  understand and draw on  different  knowledge\r\n\r\ndisciplines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our universities have already moved towards offering\r\n\r\na  broader  undergraduate education  with  cross  faculty\r\n\r\nmodules.   Their  programmes  had  been  based   on   the\r\n\r\ntraditional  British model.  Such a model - characterised\r\n\r\nby  specialised degree programmes - had served  us  well.\r\n\r\nGoing  forward, we should be cognisant of the demands  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  economy,  which require a  greater  breadth  of\r\n\r\nknowledge and skills.  Hence, the move towards  a  broad-based  education  model adopted by many US  universities.\r\n\r\nThe  changes  to  our  JC programme are  motivated  by  a\r\n\r\nsimilar recognition of the merits of a broader education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new JC curriculum has three key features.\r\n\r\nFirst,  JC  education  will  be  more  broad-based.   All\r\n\r\nstudents will do a contrasting subject outside their main\r\n\r\narea of specialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of a more broad-based JC education is\r\n\r\nnot to teach more facts about more things.  The intention\r\n\r\nis  to ensure our students acquire a strong grounding  in\r\n\r\nthe major families of disciplines and an understanding of\r\n\r\ndifferent   ways  of  knowing  the  world  -  scientific,\r\n\r\nmathematical, humanistic.  Our students must have  strong\r\n\r\nanchors in both the sciences, which seek the truths about\r\n\r\nthe  physical, social and biological worlds, as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe  humanities,  which tell us about  man's  search  for\r\n\r\nindividual meaning and social purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will ensure students have a fuller\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of the world around them  -  the  physical\r\n\r\nworld, the biological world, the social world, the  world\r\n\r\nof   human  experiences,  our  past,  our  society,   and\r\n\r\nourselves - so that they are better able to draw on  this\r\n\r\nto create their own future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the new JC curriculum will do more to\r\n\r\nnurture knowledge skills -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconceptual thinking skills, communications skills  and  a\r\n\r\nfirm grasp of different modes of knowledge inquiry.  In a\r\n\r\nglobalised,    technologically   driven,    fast-changing\r\n\r\nknowledge  society,  our young need to  be  critical  and\r\n\r\noriginal  thinkers,  as well as to  present  their  ideas\r\n\r\ncogently, persuasively and forcefully to win the  contest\r\n\r\nof ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's JC curriculum emphasises both process skills\r\n\r\nand  content  mastery, though more could  be  done.   The\r\n\r\nvarious  subject  disciplines in  JC  education  seek  to\r\n\r\ndeliver   core  skills,  such  as  communication  skills,\r\n\r\ninformation   and  knowledge  application   skills,   and\r\n\r\nthinking  skills and creativity.  Project Work  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced since 2000 to develop inter-disciplinary\r\n\r\nlearning, collaborative skills, independent thinking, and\r\n\r\ncommunication skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new JC curriculum will build on these changes.\r\n\r\nProject Work will be brought within the formal `A'  level\r\n\r\nframework  and  accorded  the same  standing  as  General\r\n\r\nPaper.   The different modes of gathering, analysing  and\r\n\r\nsynthesising  knowledge  will be  infused  into  existing\r\n\r\nsubjects.   We are introducing a new optional  subject  - Knowledge   and  Inquiry  -  to  develop  the  conceptual\r\n\r\nabilities of our students to a higher level, and to  have\r\n\r\nthem    critically   analyse   issues   from    different\r\n\r\nperspectives    by   drawing   upon   knowledge    across\r\n\r\ndisciplines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad-based nature of the revised curriculum\r\n\r\nwill  also  help develop a more flexible way of  thinking\r\n\r\nand   a  creative  bent  among  our  students.   The  new\r\n\r\ncurriculum's stronger multi-disciplinary orientation will\r\n\r\nenhance  our  students' capacity to synthesize  knowledge\r\n\r\nacross   different  subject  areas  and  appreciate   the\r\n\r\ninterconnections between disciplines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, and importantly, the new JC curriculum will\r\n\r\nplace added emphasis on developing the personal qualities\r\n\r\nthat  our  JC  students  need  to  be  good  leaders  and\r\n\r\ncommitted  citizens.    Our  education  system  seeks  to\r\n\r\nnurture a balanced and holistic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhuman being and citizen.  A comprehensive education  must\r\n\r\naim   not  merely  at  academic  achievement,  which   is\r\n\r\nimportant, but also at developing qualities of  mind  and\r\n\r\nmotivation,  and  the  cultivation of  sound  values  and\r\n\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-academic curriculum plays a critical role - through participation in co-curricula activities, such as\r\n\r\nsports,  uniformed groups or the arts, students learn  to\r\n\r\nwork  with  each other to achieve common goals  and  lead\r\n\r\nwith  confidence even in adversity.  Tough  training  for\r\n\r\ncompetitions  nurtures endurance and  ruggedness  in  our\r\n\r\nstudents.   They  learn  to be good  team  players,  take\r\n\r\nrisks,  think  on  their  feet  and  exhibit  initiative,\r\n\r\nresolve and resilience in the face of setbacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, under the new JC curriculum framework,\r\n\r\nstudents  will need to meet minimum requirements  in  co-curricula  activities and Character Development Programme\r\n\r\nparticipation to complete their JC education.  A holistic\r\n\r\ncertification  will be introduced, with CCA  achievements\r\n\r\nand  academic  grades reflected on  the  same  `A'  level\r\n\r\ncertificate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>A more diverse education landscape</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond curriculum, the recommendations of the JC\r\n\r\nreview  will also bring changes to the upper secondary/JC\r\n\r\neducation landscape.  There will be greater diversity  in\r\n\r\nthe types of programmes, mix of schools, and pathways  to\r\n\r\nuniversity  education.  We will allow for new Specialised\r\n\r\nIndependent   Schools  in  areas  like  Mathematics   and\r\n\r\nScience; integrated programmes for upper secondary and JC\r\n\r\neducation; alternative qualifications, like the IB; and 2-3 privately-funded schools to be established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more diverse education landscape is desirable for\r\n\r\ntwo reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a more diverse education system allows us to\r\n\r\ndo  more to cater to the different interests and needs of\r\n\r\nour students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current Upper Secondary/JC system with `O' and\r\n\r\n`A'  levels  is  an  excellent system for  ensuring  that\r\n\r\nstudents have a strong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstructural   framework  within  which  to   acquire   the\r\n\r\nfundamental   knowledge  and  skills  they  need   before\r\n\r\nproceeding to the next phase of education, whether it  be\r\n\r\nJC,  polytechnic  or university.  And our  students  have\r\n\r\ndone well with this structured system, with high rates of\r\n\r\ncompletion and achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there will be students who do not need such\r\n\r\na strongly structured system to acquire the fundamentals,\r\n\r\nand  can  benefit  from  a  less  structured,  integrated\r\n\r\nprogramme   for   upper  secondary  and  Junior   College\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen this working very well at top high\r\n\r\nschools  in  the  United States.  They  run  4-year  high\r\n\r\nschools from Grade 9 to 12, schools such as Bronx High or\r\n\r\nStuyvesant  High  in New York City, or  Thomas  Jefferson\r\n\r\nHigh  School  in the Washington DC area.   These  schools\r\n\r\nhave   very  good  integrated  programmes  in  the  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary, in the last four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review therefore proposes that we introduce\r\n\r\ndifferent pathways. Some students will benefit more  from\r\n\r\na  structured education with clear intermediate goals and\r\n\r\nbenchmarks  along  the way.  They can pace,  measure  and\r\n\r\nprove themselves as they progress.  Others will thrive in\r\n\r\na   less  structured  learning  environment  provided  by\r\n\r\nschools offering integrated programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new broad-based JC curriculum will cater to the\r\n\r\nneeds of most students, whether they are in the JCs on  a\r\n\r\n2-year  programme, or the Integrated Programme.   But  to\r\n\r\nprovide  more  diversity, JCs can also offer  alternative\r\n\r\ncurricula,  like the IB, or, as is likely  with  the  new\r\n\r\nSpecialised  Schools,  develop their  own  curriculum  or\r\n\r\nadapt one to suit their needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, diversity in our system means that we will\r\n\r\nhave  different  ways, and not just one homogeneous  way,\r\n\r\nfor  preparing our young for an innovation-driven  future\r\n\r\ncharacterised by rapid and continuous change.   Diversity\r\n\r\nwill  sow  the  seeds for vibrancy and creativity.   With\r\n\r\ndiversity,  there is greater opportunity for rejuvenation\r\n\r\nand strength.  We need a pool of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiverse  talents  with different educational  experiences\r\n\r\nand  outlook, who are able to offer different  ideas  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  be a truly vibrant country, adaptable  and\r\n\r\nresponsive to the varied challenges of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Challenges and concerns</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while I have outlined the reasons\r\n\r\nfor  this  review, and why it will serve our  people  and\r\n\r\ncountry well, I am mindful that there are challenges  and\r\n\r\nconcerns.   There are likely to be concerns that  a  more\r\n\r\ndiversified  system will lead to greater  differentiation\r\n\r\nand elitism.  Sir, we all do want a system that can offer\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  are more appropriate to  the  different\r\n\r\nabilities  and aptitudes of our students, and  this  does\r\n\r\nmean  that  we  will need a more diversified  system  and\r\n\r\ndifferentiation in order to achieve this.   By  providing\r\n\r\nthe   greater  opportunities  that  such  diversification\r\n\r\noffers,  our students, our society and Singapore will  be\r\n\r\nthe better off for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in so doing, we must continue to adhere to two\r\n\r\nimportant principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that our education system is meritocratic and\r\n\r\nprovides equal opportunity.  Our Integrated Programme and\r\n\r\nSpecialised  schools  will  therefore  continue  to  have\r\n\r\ntransparent  and merit-based criteria for  entry.   There\r\n\r\nwill  also be no reduction in opportunities for deserving\r\n\r\nstudents to join our top institutions.  In that regard, I\r\n\r\nsee  more  opportunities and choices for Singaporeans  as\r\n\r\nthey  will have the opportunity of not just going to  JC,\r\n\r\nbut  also for Integrated Programmes, Specialised  schools\r\n\r\nin  Mathematics and Science, Sports, or the Arts, and  to\r\n\r\nenrol in schools that offer alternative qualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and perhaps more importantly, those students\r\n\r\nwho  will  benefit  from the greater educational  options\r\n\r\nbeing  introduced must not forget that the  opportunities\r\n\r\nthey  enjoy are ultimately justified only by the  quality\r\n\r\nof  their  commitment and service to our nation  and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral social good.  If our JC students leave the system\r\n\r\nvery   bright,  very  creative  and  innovative,   having\r\n\r\nbenefited from the best\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  our  system has to offer, but without  a  sense  of\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  country  and  obligation  to  his  fellow\r\n\r\ncitizens,  then  all  this  effort  would  have  come  to\r\n\r\nnothing.  But this is not something that we can  do  only\r\n\r\nwithin   the   education  system.   This  is   a   shared\r\n\r\nresponsibility.

These proposals  aim  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  improvements as well  as  address  some  basic\r\n\r\nproblems in our education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, the Ministry has steadfastly asserted the\r\n\r\nvirtues  of our education system.  Therefore, I  consider\r\n\r\nthis  Motion significant for the Ministry to  admit  that\r\n\r\nthere  are shortcomings in the system and, secondly,  for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to accept the recommendations of  a  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee established not so many months ago with members\r\n\r\nfrom outside the Ministry.  Admittedly, by accepting  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Review Committee, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  has  taken  a giant step  in  resolving  these\r\n\r\nsystemic  issues.   In fact, these proposed  changes  are\r\n\r\nconsidered   so   fundamental  that  the   Minister   has\r\n\r\nrecommended to the Prime Minister that the Whip be lifted\r\n\r\nso that PAP Members of Parliament could debate the motion\r\n\r\nthoroughly without restraint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, every parent with a child in our\r\n\r\nschool  system  has  an opinion on  how  to  improve  our\r\n\r\neducation system.  However, to be able to come out with a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  overhaul requires courage  to  admit  that\r\n\r\nthere  are problems, an exceptional ability to grasp  the\r\n\r\ngist  of these problems, and the clarity of mind to  come\r\n\r\nout with the solutions.  I believe that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Review  Committee,  under the  chairmanship  of  the\r\n\r\nSenior Minister of State, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,  has\r\n\r\nmanaged to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One regrettable aspect of the report is that it\r\n\r\ncontained so many new initiatives that the reader may not\r\n\r\nsee  the  forest  for the trees.  To me, Sir,  two  major\r\n\r\nthrusts  - the JC curriculum and the Integrated Programme\r\n\r\n-  could  have  been better clearly de-linked  and  their\r\n\r\nmerits considered separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a way of setting the stage, let me list out\r\n\r\nthe  shortcomings  of  our existing  secondary  education\r\n\r\nsystem,  and then look at whether the reform proposed  in\r\n\r\nthe  report  has addressed them.  What are the  generally\r\n\r\nperceived  issues regarding our upper secondary education\r\n\r\nat  the  moment?  In simple terms, they can be summarised\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the overall workload is high, in fact, very\r\n\r\nhigh.   The workload of a typical student is around 1,700\r\n\r\ninstruction hours for the \"A\" level programme  comprising\r\n\r\nthe  General  Paper,  mother  tongue  language  and  four\r\n\r\nprincipal  subjects.   For individual  subjects  such  as\r\n\r\nScience  and  Mathematics, our workload is  heavier  than\r\n\r\nequivalent  programmes  in the  United  Kingdom  and  the\r\n\r\nUnited States by at least 15%, sometimes more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, life as a student in Singapore is very\r\n\r\nstressful.  Our students strive to take as many  subjects\r\n\r\nas  possible and to score as many As as they can achieve.\r\n\r\nThey  also  choose  more deterministic subjects  such  as\r\n\r\nScience  and Mathematics and to shy away from humanities.\r\n\r\nOne  of  the  factors  in driving  our  students  is  our\r\n\r\nemphasis  on meritocracy and transparency. When it  comes\r\n\r\nto scholarship applications and university admissions, we\r\n\r\nprimarily  look  at  the  examination  results   of   the\r\n\r\napplicants.    And  given  that  the  examinations   test\r\n\r\nprimarily the mastery of these content-based subjects, it\r\n\r\nis  possible for those with the mental ability  to  score\r\n\r\nbetter  and better grades just by spending more and  more\r\n\r\nhours  memorising the facts and honing their  examination\r\n\r\nskills by practising on the 10-year series.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, our education system overwhelmingly favours\r\n\r\ndiscipline  and  the  ability to  apply  oneself.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  our students learn too much fact and not  enough\r\n\r\nabilities.   In  particular, we  are  short  in  thinking\r\n\r\nskills as well as social skills.  In effect, our students\r\n\r\nbecome  very  good in solving known problems using  known\r\n\r\nsolutions  but become hesitant and unsure when confronted\r\n\r\nwith new problems, a behaviour regularly observed by  our\r\n\r\nuniversity and polytechnic lecturers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these observations are not new. But what\r\n\r\nprompted  MOE to set up the Review Committee?  I  surmise\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  two  reasons. First,  we  have  painted\r\n\r\nourselves  into a corner as far as the evolution  of  the\r\n\r\neducation  system in the secondary schools is  concerned.\r\n\r\nEvolution in the natural world has taught us that  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  to continuously evolve to adjust  to  changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  In my opinion, Sir, our JC education  had\r\n\r\nmade a wrong turn many years back into a cul de sac.  Why\r\n\r\ndo  I  say  so?   Our  teachers have become  so  good  in\r\n\r\ntutoring their charges in scorings and our students  have\r\n\r\nbecome  so  good in honing their examination skills  that\r\n\r\nthe  only way to segregate the outstanding students  from\r\n\r\nthe  mere  excellent is to make the subjects  harder  and\r\n\r\nharder.   And as we crank up the ratchet one  turn  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  over the years, we lost sight of what we are trying\r\n\r\nto achieve in education.   The ranking of schools and the\r\n\r\nstudents became the proxy measurements for success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our typical \"A\" level students are required\r\n\r\nto  spend  about  330  hours in one  subject  versus  the\r\n\r\nequivalent  280 hours in the United Kingdom's \"A\"  level.\r\n\r\nIt  is  even  more when we compare to the United  States'\r\n\r\nequivalent of 240 hours.  Our students are so  far  ahead\r\n\r\nwhen they are admitted to the United States universities,\r\n\r\neven  into the very best US universities.  They are given\r\n\r\nexemption   for   many  first-year   subjects   such   as\r\n\r\nMathematics and Sciences.  Furthermore, in the  last  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevel  examinations, the number of students  scoring  4As\r\n\r\nhas  once again broken the record.  The end of better and\r\n\r\nbetter  scholastic results is not in  sight.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink we have somehow managed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanipulate  our  children's genes so that  they  are  now\r\n\r\nbrighter and smarter than the previous generations.  What\r\n\r\nhappens is that our children just have learnt a whole lot\r\n\r\nmore  in the process of preparing for the \"A\" level.   If\r\n\r\nwe do not transform our education system, the only way to\r\n\r\nprovide  some  differentiation among top students  is  to\r\n\r\ncrank  up  the  ratchet one more time, so  much  so  that\r\n\r\nperhaps one day in the future, our students will be given\r\n\r\nexemption  from  even more senior level classes,  perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  sophomore year classes in the United  States.   This\r\n\r\nshall  be obvious to all, lay persons and experts  alike,\r\n\r\nthat  to continue this path is not what education is  all\r\n\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason that the Minister has already\r\n\r\ntouched  on  is that the Singapore economy in the  future\r\n\r\nrequires a very different type of workforce than what our\r\n\r\neducation  system is geared to produce  and  our  current\r\n\r\nsevere recession has driven home this key point.   Up  to\r\n\r\nnow,  our  economy  has done well by adopting  production\r\n\r\ntechniques  from  the  developed countries  and  we  will\r\n\r\nrefine  them so that Singaporeans are more efficient  and\r\n\r\neffective  in performing those jobs.  And the  output  of\r\n\r\nour education system is well-suited for this task.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,   our   economy  has  grown  since   independence\r\n\r\nspectacularly.   However, as we try to upgrade  ourselves\r\n\r\ninto  a  knowledge-based economy, we  discover  that  our\r\n\r\nengine  sputters  as we step on the accelerator's  pedal.\r\n\r\nWhat  happened?  Some say that we did not develop  enough\r\n\r\nintellectual  property  ourselves  that  the  others  are\r\n\r\nwilling  to pay for.  Others say that we are not creative\r\n\r\nenough.  In other words, our workforce basically does not\r\n\r\nknow how to leverage the knowledge we have in our systems\r\n\r\nand  processes into goods and services that the world  is\r\n\r\nprepared to pay for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of a rapidly changing economy is\r\n\r\nthe  rapid transformation of job skills.  As we no longer\r\n\r\ncould predict the job skills that will be required in the\r\n\r\nfuture,  it  is  better  to train our  population  to  be\r\n\r\nflexible and adaptable instead of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing  channelled into specialised areas too  early.   To\r\n\r\nfix  these two problems, the whole education system  must\r\n\r\nbe   transformed,   and   some   part   of   which   very\r\n\r\nfundamentally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that the JC curriculum is\r\n\r\nthe  first  step in a complete overhaul of our  education\r\n\r\nsystem to be more like the United States' system compared\r\n\r\nto  the  United  Kingdom's system.  It puts  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nthinking  skills  and  avoids early  over-specialisation.\r\n\r\nOur  local universities have already recognised the  need\r\n\r\nand  have taken the step to transform themselves from the\r\n\r\nBritish system to the American system.  Thus, the changes\r\n\r\nin the JC curriculum will remove the disjoint that exists\r\n\r\ntoday  between the JCs and the universities. This  change\r\n\r\nis  welcomed  by  everyone that  the  Feedback  Unit  has\r\n\r\nconsulted with regard to the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what the new curriculum does not\r\n\r\naddress  is  the  workload  and  the  stress  of  the  JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   Yes,  we  know our students  can  take  the\r\n\r\nstress.  Yes, they can take the load.  But why should  we\r\n\r\nsubject  our  children  to this  very  trying,  tempering\r\n\r\nprocess?   The  White Paper did not address the  question\r\n\r\nwhether  it is necessary to impose such a heavy  workload\r\n\r\non our students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, Sir, on the contrary, the new\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  by  requiring the  need  to  take  a  cross-discipline subject, would probably increase the workload.\r\n\r\nIt  is true that through the new classification of H1, H2\r\n\r\nand   H3,  the  Ministry  proposes  to  keep  the   total\r\n\r\ninstruction  hours  the  same.   But  by  increasing  the\r\n\r\nemphasis on project work, thinking skills and the need to\r\n\r\ntake  a  new subject in a different discipline, I believe\r\n\r\nstudents will need to spend more time instead of the same\r\n\r\namount  of  time.   It  is regrettable  that  the  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  did  not  delve into this area  and  take  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  make the necessary adjustment  to  bring\r\n\r\ndown the total workload.  I would request the Minister to\r\n\r\nmonitor   the  workload  very  carefully   in   the   new\r\n\r\nimplementation and to make necessary adjustments,  if  so\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another impact on students that we have to watch out\r\n\r\nfor will be their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponse  to  the  new  emphasis on thinking  skills  and\r\n\r\nproject work.  These are harder to do well in, especially\r\n\r\nfor  those  who are not so strong in the command  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish   Language,   in  writing   and   in   expressing\r\n\r\nthemselves.  It is likely that these students will prefer\r\n\r\nthe  old approach and I believe that they will aim to  go\r\n\r\nto the universities via the polytechnic route after their\r\n\r\n\"O\"  level.  Thus, it is likely that some years down  the\r\n\r\nroad  after we implement the new JC curriculum  that  the\r\n\r\npressure  to allow more polytechnic graduates beyond  the\r\n\r\nnow top 10% into our universities will intensify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some of the respondents to the\r\n\r\nFeedback  Unit  feel  that the JC curriculum  would  only\r\n\r\nimpact the top 25% of the cohort and is therefore not  of\r\n\r\nmajor  interest to the majority of our students.  I think\r\n\r\nthis  view  is mistaken as the influence of  this  change\r\n\r\nwould  be felt all the way down the school system to  the\r\n\r\nprimary   level.   Parents  would  recognise   that   the\r\n\r\nattribute that would enable their children to do well  in\r\n\r\nthe  new  \"A\" level examinations has got to be inculcated\r\n\r\nfor  many years in the lower secondary as well as in  the\r\n\r\nprimary  levels.  Contrary to public perception,  the  JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum  would  touch  the  life  of  every  child  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  this is all the more so  because  of  the\r\n\r\nintegrated programme or the \"through-train\" concept to be\r\n\r\nintroduced concurrently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the \"through-train\" concept has been floated\r\n\r\nfor  many  years  now.   A number of  JCs  and  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  have  already  signed up  to  the  concept.   It\r\n\r\ntargets  the top 10% of the cohort so that they could  go\r\n\r\nstraight to the \"A\" level without having to sit  for  the\r\n\r\nintermediate \"O\" level examinations.  Since  25%  of  our\r\n\r\ncohort would move on to the JC, 10% would be the top two-fifths  of this group.  We could be quite confident  that\r\n\r\nthe drop-out from the Integrated Programme (IP) would  be\r\n\r\nfew  and far between and naturally most of the GEP pupils\r\n\r\nwill be enrolled into the IP programme.  In my mind, Sir,\r\n\r\nIP is, in essence, an extension of the streaming exercise\r\n\r\nthat started way back in the primary level.  Is this good\r\n\r\nor bad?  This is, in fact, a very fundamental\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestion and indeed the more troubling proposal  in  this\r\n\r\nWhite Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it should be obvious that by skipping the \"O\"\r\n\r\nlevels,  the  IP  confers  significant  benefits  to  the\r\n\r\nstudents  in  the  programme.  Just by looking  from  the\r\n\r\nangle  of  time  utilisation, these students  would  have\r\n\r\nclose to six months for other development activities that\r\n\r\nthe  \"O\"  level  students  would  spend  at  Secondary  4\r\n\r\npreparing   for  their  examinations.  Furthermore,   the\r\n\r\nMinistry proposes to introduce the single admission to JC\r\n\r\n1  concurrently  to  solve the  problem  of  churning  of\r\n\r\nstudents  after their \"O\" level examinations.  Thus,  the\r\n\r\nnew  JC  1  intake will enroll as late as in March  after\r\n\r\ntheir \"O\" levels in the following year.  And during  this\r\n\r\nperiod,  Sir,  I  do  not think the students  in  the  IP\r\n\r\nprogramme will stay at home marking time.  I am sure that\r\n\r\nthey  will be back in the schools, being nurtured.  Thus,\r\n\r\nthe IP students would have as much as up to eight months'\r\n\r\ninteraction time more than a student who took the  normal\r\n\r\nroute  or the Express stream.  Sir, bearing in mind  that\r\n\r\nthe IP students are the top 10% of the cohort in terms of\r\n\r\nintelligence and abilities, I believe these students will\r\n\r\nend  up having a very measurable advantage over the other\r\n\r\nstudents  in the Express stream or in the Normal  stream.\r\n\r\nThey  would probably be so good that they might be  given\r\n\r\nthe label \"super-express stream\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IP programme illustrates once again the tensions\r\n\r\nbetween  two  different and opposing views in  education.\r\n\r\nDo  we  strive for an egalitarian system catering to  the\r\n\r\nmajority  and  leaving  the  bright  ones  to  fend   for\r\n\r\nthemselves  or  do we provide the best to the  brightest,\r\n\r\nnurturing  them to their fullest potential?  If  we  take\r\n\r\nthe  first  approach,  we would  not  be  maximising  the\r\n\r\npotential of our very best, which could make a difference\r\n\r\nbetween  growth  and  stagnation  for  Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  If we take the second approach, in other  words,\r\n\r\nthe   IP   approach,  will  we  generate   a   sense   of\r\n\r\ndisenchantment  among our young who are  not  in  the  IP\r\n\r\nprogramme,  that  the system is stacked against  them  if\r\n\r\nnature  does not endow them with the genes to do well  in\r\n\r\nour system?  How do we deal with the frustrations that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  with the realisation that determination, discipline\r\n\r\nand  other  human  qualities come second,  while  natural\r\n\r\nendowment becomes most important?  How do we address  the\r\n\r\nrootedness of Singaporeans when some of us are dealt with\r\n\r\na lousy deck of cards, and the Government reinforces this\r\n\r\nin our education system?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, Sir, I am torn between these two\r\n\r\npoles.   In  my  mind,  I  think  IP  is  necessary   and\r\n\r\nappropriate,  and  would  bring  great  benefit  to   the\r\n\r\nstudents  in the stream.  In my heart, I feel  that  this\r\n\r\nwill  intensify  the angst and stress  in  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem  and  make for perhaps a less harmonious  society.\r\n\r\nIn  view  of  the Singapore economy which  will  be  very\r\n\r\ndependent  on the creativity of our people,  my  mind  is\r\n\r\nwinning this tug of war but my heart wishes that it  need\r\n\r\nnot be so.  Nonetheless, I would urge the Ministry to  be\r\n\r\ncognisant of this when implementing the IP.  This  should\r\n\r\ngive the assurance that the non-IP students will continue\r\n\r\nto  get the attention and the resources allocated to them\r\n\r\ncurrently.   I  am  glad  to note that  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\ncognisant  of this and has already reassured  us  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both of these concepts look good on paper.\r\n\r\nWhether  they  will bring the benefits we  envisage  will\r\n\r\ndepend  on the implementation.  There are many issues  of\r\n\r\nimplementation - and there are 31 speakers after me.  The\r\n\r\nkey  one, in my mind, is the preparedness of the teachers\r\n\r\nby  2006.   The  question is:  will these  few  years  be\r\n\r\nsufficient  to get the system ready?  I believe  that  in\r\n\r\nimplementing  the IP, only a number of  schools  will  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  initially.  I understand that  this  number  is\r\n\r\nless  than  the number of schools currently offering  the\r\n\r\nGEP.   So,  do  we also admit non-GEP students  into  IP?\r\n\r\nWhat would happen to the GEP students in schools that are\r\n\r\nnot  implementing  the  IP?  How  do  we  deal  with  the\r\n\r\naspirations of the GEP students in these schools if  they\r\n\r\ncould not be transferred to the IP?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other recommendations in the White\r\n\r\nPaper,  such as the establishment of private schools  and\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nability   of   some  schools  to  offer  other   academic\r\n\r\nprogrammes such as the IB.  These are meant to bring  out\r\n\r\ngreater  diversity in the education system  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nspecific needs of the student population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe it is reasonable to experiment with\r\n\r\nthe  concept  of  private  secondary  schools.   In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  am  glad  that MOE has insisted  that  these\r\n\r\nschools must meet the minimum criteria of 50% Singaporean\r\n\r\nstudents  in  the  population and must  comply  with  the\r\n\r\nNational  Education guidelines.  I have  no  great  issue\r\n\r\nwith the private schools, except that we must address the\r\n\r\nconcern  of  the public about the exclusiveness  of  such\r\n\r\nschools.   Already, there are public comments  about  our\r\n\r\nstudents   not  interacting  enough  between   those   of\r\n\r\ndifferent  ethnic backgrounds.  We need  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nsuch  independent schools do not become institutes  where\r\n\r\nonly  the  sons and daughters of the rich and the  famous\r\n\r\nintermingle and build networks for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the recommendations of the White\r\n\r\nPaper   will  bring  about  fundamental  and  significant\r\n\r\nchanges  in our education system.  I would like to  thank\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister of State Tharman for steering his Review\r\n\r\nCommittee to come out with these comprehensive and  well-considered  policy  recommendations  and  to  thank   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  accepting  these  recommendations.   These\r\n\r\nchanges  will  affect every Singaporean.  For  some,  the\r\n\r\nchange  will  be beneficial.  For others, it  will  bring\r\n\r\nabout  greater  anxiety  and  stress.   To  me,  what  is\r\n\r\nimportant is that the motivation of the MOE is a positive\r\n\r\none,  and I am glad to hear that the Ministry is prepared\r\n\r\nto   do  what  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the   new\r\n\r\ninitiatives would succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to break through the present mindset\r\n\r\nand  to  bring the education system in Singapore  to  the\r\n\r\nnext  higher level of performance.  I support the changes\r\n\r\nbut  urge caution and continuous monitoring to remedy any\r\n\r\nnegative impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, I am delighted\r\n\r\nthat far-reaching changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare   now  being  proposed  to  the  system  of  JC/Upper\r\n\r\nSecondary School education.  The present system  has  not\r\n\r\nhad  a  major  revamp  for  30 years.  Like  so  much  of\r\n\r\nSingapore Inc., it is highly efficient and accomplishes a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  with  minimum fuss.   But  the  accompanying\r\n\r\nlitany of complaints is long and familiar.  And my fellow\r\n\r\nParliamentary colleagues before me have given details  of\r\n\r\nsome of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students and parents bemoan the undue stress the\r\n\r\nsystem  has  imposed from intense rote learning  and  the\r\n\r\ncookie  cutter approach.  Significantly, by  agreeing  to\r\n\r\nthe  reduction  in  the number of  hours  per  'A'  level\r\n\r\nsubject,  the  MOE  seems to implicitly  admit  that  the\r\n\r\npresent   system,   by  international  comparison,   over\r\n\r\nteachers  in  terms  of  content and  subject  hours,  is\r\n\r\ngenerating an enormously stressful learning experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University educators and employers find our students\r\n\r\nwanting,  because they are adept at knowledge acquisition\r\n\r\nbut  not  knowledge application or creation.  They  often\r\n\r\nbemoan  the  failure of the system to inculcate  critical\r\n\r\nthinking and communication skills.  It is well known that\r\n\r\nSingaporean  students are reticent and poor communicators\r\n\r\nin comparison with foreign counterparts.  These anecdotal\r\n\r\nobservations have thus far not been negated by statistics\r\n\r\nthat  many  Government departments are fond of  using  to\r\n\r\ndemolish arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, they are reinforced by a recent study by the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Trade and Industry which shows clearly  that,\r\n\r\ncompared  to the advanced economies, Singapore is  pretty\r\n\r\nstrong  in  acquiring  knowledge,  but  is  less  so   in\r\n\r\ncreating,  disseminating  or applying  information.   The\r\n\r\nreport  further notes that it is in knowledge application\r\n\r\nwhere  Singapore  lags  furthest  behind  and  here,  the\r\n\r\nweakest link is entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, please let me state categorically at the outset\r\n\r\nthat  I  do see the value of a rigorous education  system\r\n\r\nthat  stretches students, and stress per se is indeed  no\r\n\r\nreason  to  relax  the rigour of the  JC/Upper  Secondary\r\n\r\neducation  system.   The estimated  25%  of  each  year's\r\n\r\ncohort that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenter   Upper   Secondary/JC,  one  can  safely   assume,\r\n\r\nrepresent the best of the crop and nothing beats  a  good\r\n\r\nsolid  education to prepare them for either a  university\r\n\r\neducation  or alternative learning pathways to  a  useful\r\n\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any question, the changes taking place all\r\n\r\naround  us  call for new responses. We urgently  need  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up a pool of trained manpower with the skills  and\r\n\r\nthe  aptitude  to  tackle the economic  challenges  of  a\r\n\r\nhighly  competitive globalised, knowledge and innovation-driven economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the tirade of recommendations made by the\r\n\r\nERC  sub-committees,  the need to  revamp  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem   to  foster  entrepreneurship  stands  out   very\r\n\r\nstrongly  as  a  common and central  recommendation.   In\r\n\r\nfact, one of the strongest advocates comes from the  Sub-committee  on  Enhancing Human Capital,  chaired  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State for Manpower and Education, Dr  Ng  Eng\r\n\r\nHen, himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Minister of State Ng Eng Hen's recent ERC\r\n\r\nsub-committee  report begins where the White  Paper  also\r\n\r\nbegins   -   the pressing need to inject more flexibility\r\n\r\nand diversity into our education system.   The goal is to\r\n\r\nenable  the  system  to perform optimally  its  equipping\r\n\r\ntask,  and  make  our schools, to use  the  ERC  report's\r\n\r\nmemorable  words,  \"creators  of  knowledge,  engines  of\r\n\r\ninnovation and cradles of enterprise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, there are, I believe, three\r\n\r\nunderlying core principles enunciated in the review:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. greater breadth - with focus on thinking and\r\n\r\nhigher   order  skills,  not  just  academic  or  subject\r\n\r\ncontent;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. greater flexibility - to accommodate\r\n\r\npreference for different types and depth of subjects; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. greater diversity - to allow different\r\n\r\npathways  of education to accommodate different types  of\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support these broad principles and aims\r\n\r\nenunciated.  But in my assessment,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have  still not been applied widely  or  rigorously\r\n\r\nenough  to the vision for a new education landscape.   In\r\n\r\nwhat  follows, I will explain my reasons by  highlighting\r\n\r\nfive major concerns arising from the review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern relates to execution. While the\r\n\r\nprinciples  are sound, the execution can and should  take\r\n\r\non  different hues.  Thus, a key concern would be in  the\r\n\r\nmanner  of  implementation of the  recommendations.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  how can existing teachers, who are  themselves\r\n\r\nproducts  of an era where education is largely  knowledge\r\n\r\nacquisition, as well as new teachers, be equipped to help\r\n\r\nstudents  develop conceptual thinking, knowledge  process\r\n\r\nskills, independent thinking and communication skills?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the changes that must be made to the\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  new  teachers and their  training?   How\r\n\r\nshould  the syllabus, teaching and assessment methods  be\r\n\r\nshaped  to  ensure they achieve the aims of  the  review?\r\n\r\nWhat  needs  to  be  done for existing  and  often  older\r\n\r\nteachers to help them grasp the issues?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry\r\n\r\nand  Education, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who chairs the\r\n\r\nReview  Committee,  himself  had  acknowledged  that  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of the revised curriculum hinges on  how  it  is\r\n\r\nexecuted, particularly in the curriculum design  and  the\r\n\r\ntraining of teachers.  As they say, the devil is  in  the\r\n\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most enlightened and exquisite curriculum or\r\n\r\nprogramme  is  only as good as the way it is implemented.\r\n\r\nHere, I quote the editorial of the Straits Times of  16th\r\n\r\nNovember 2002:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where the education system is concerned, it is not\r\n\r\njust  a  matter  of  rearranging  chairs,  building   new\r\n\r\nschools,  but  changing the insides of people,  including\r\n\r\nthe  people  tasked  with making the changes.   Who  will\r\n\r\nteach the teachers?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, from the feedback I have received, I suspect\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  little disagreement  among  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nabout the noble intentions of the changes, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  \"How\" will need to be carefully crafted and conveyed\r\n\r\nto all stakeholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that MOE involve educators\r\n\r\nand  other relevant stakeholders in the design of the new\r\n\r\ncurriculum  and  make  the process  more  transparent  to\r\n\r\nparents  and  students.  Before actual implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe  revised  curriculum, MOE should widely expose  these\r\n\r\nfor comments by the stakeholders so that any kinks can be\r\n\r\nironed out before implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOE,  in  accepting this report by the Review  Committee,\r\n\r\nshould  also follow up with a subsequent report regarding\r\n\r\nhow   the   curriculum  has  been  revised  and  trimmed,\r\n\r\nadditional new teaching and assessment methods that  need\r\n\r\nto  be  adopted to achieve the aims of the report.   This\r\n\r\ncould  be  presented  to the public  and  Parliament  for\r\n\r\nfeedback.  And at this juncture I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for noting that some of these would be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern relates to the need to take at\r\n\r\nleast   one  contrasting  subject  and  implications   on\r\n\r\nworkload.   I  fully subscribe to the logic of  having  a\r\n\r\ncontrasting subject, so as to expose students to subjects\r\n\r\noutside their core content knowledge, and help them think\r\n\r\nin   inter-disciplinary  terms.   Increasingly,   complex\r\n\r\nproblems   we   are  facing  call  for  multi-dimensional\r\n\r\nresponses that a broad-based education can elicit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the execution of this could leave much to be\r\n\r\ndesired.   Specifically, except for perhaps a handful  of\r\n\r\nstudents, the majority do not possess the aptitude to  be\r\n\r\nmore  or  less competent in every subject.  Most students\r\n\r\nhave  preferences  and  aptitude  for  one  category   of\r\n\r\nsubjects - eg, science or arts.  To accommodate a broader\r\n\r\nbased  enhanced  curriculum,  the  Review  Committee  has\r\n\r\nproposed  trimming curriculum content and  time  of  each\r\n\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even though the number of hours per subject\r\n\r\nis reduced, the need for a contrasting subject brings the\r\n\r\ntotal  tally for a typical \"A\" level student to a minimum\r\n\r\nof 7 subjects, up from the existing minimum of 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may mean greater stress as students are taxed\r\n\r\nbeyond  the comfort zone of the subjects around the  core\r\n\r\nareas  that they prefer.  The aim of broadening students'\r\n\r\nhorizon  beyond  the academic would be defeated  if  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  struggle  unduly in their contrasting  subject,\r\n\r\nleaving them with precious little time for anything else.\r\n\r\nIn fact, whilst there would be a 10% reduction in overall\r\n\r\ncurriculum  time under the proposed system, for  existing\r\n\r\ntriple  Science students doing 4 \"A\" levels, the  overall\r\n\r\ncurriculum  time  for  Humanities students  doing  3  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevels will remain unchanged at about 1,300 hours.   This\r\n\r\nmeans  that  the  weaker students in the  cohort  may  be\r\n\r\nunduly  stretched as they now have to take more  subjects\r\n\r\nand  on  top of this, at least one subject outside  their\r\n\r\nspecialisation in the same overall curriculum time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the typical \"kiasu\" Singaporean\r\n\r\nparents  would  want their children to  do  well  in  all\r\n\r\nsubjects,  as  long  as the subject  contributes  to  the\r\n\r\nadmission  criteria  of our local  universities.   Hence,\r\n\r\nadditional  pressure may also emanate from  this  source.\r\n\r\nOnce  again,  the  recommendations could  falter  at  the\r\n\r\nexecution stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To alleviate this problem, it must be ensured that\r\n\r\nthe   reduced  hours  genuinely  reflect  correspondingly\r\n\r\nreduced  content, that does not somehow creep  back  into\r\n\r\nthe system by way of after-class teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third major concern relates to the through-train\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the proposals to have through-train\r\n\r\nto  accelerate the learning pace and offer  the  brighter\r\n\r\nstudents time to pursue their interests and enrich  their\r\n\r\nown educational experience without having their attention\r\n\r\ndiverted by two major examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As only the brightest crop of students - the top 10%\r\n\r\n-  will  be permitted to participate, the risk  of  these\r\n\r\nstudents being left without completing at least  the  \"O\"\r\n\r\nlevels should they fail the through-train will be remote.\r\n\r\nIn  some  ways, the through-train is thus another version\r\n\r\nof the GEP, and yet another form of streaming.  I know of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  parents who desire that their children be  able  to\r\n\r\nenter the GEP.  Additionally, the perception is that  the\r\n\r\nbest   resources  are  also  devoted  to  grooming  these\r\n\r\nstudents, perhaps more so on a per capita basis than  the\r\n\r\nrest  of the crop.  The fact that this programme and  its\r\n\r\nsuccessor,  the through-train, falls within the  national\r\n\r\nschool  system  raises the prospect  that  this  is  like\r\n\r\nofficially sanctioned Darwinism at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully accept that we are all made differently\r\n\r\nand  abilities  likewise vary.  I also subscribe  to  the\r\n\r\nidea  that bright students with exceptional aptitude  are\r\n\r\nbetter  off  developing other skills  and  pursuing  non-curriculum-related  work  for  character  and  leadership\r\n\r\nhoning  than taking two major examinations.  But I  would\r\n\r\nlike MOE to consider steps to ensure that the creme de la\r\n\r\ncreme  of  Singapore's  student population  entering  the\r\n\r\nthrough-train  programme  do  not  develop   isolationist\r\n\r\ntendencies,  but  integrate into the mainstream  and  not\r\n\r\nlook down at their lesser brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is comforting to note that schools and JCs\r\n\r\nplanning  to run the integrated programme will set  aside\r\n\r\nor  offer additional places to ensure that students  from\r\n\r\nnon-affiliated schools are not shut out of the JC.  These\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools  would  also  continue  to  offer  the\r\n\r\nstandard  \"O\" level track which would allow  students  to\r\n\r\nstay on the traditional route, if they are assessed to be\r\n\r\nunable to make the mark, say, at secondary 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1990, the percentage of P1 cohort who passed\r\n\r\n\"A\"  levels has been above 20%.  Hence, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nurge the Ministry to monitor the progress and performance\r\n\r\nof  the  through-train cohort with the view of eventually\r\n\r\nmaking  it accessible to a higher percentage of students,\r\n\r\nfrom the targeted 10%, who can benefit from the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth concern relates to the setting up of\r\n\r\nprivate schools.  The Review Committee recommends  adding\r\n\r\na few privately-run and funded secondary schools and JCs.\r\n\r\nSuch schools are to add diversity and choice in education\r\n\r\nas well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  to  provide  an added source of ideas and  innovative\r\n\r\npractices in education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee acknowledges that such a move would\r\n\r\nhowever  introduce  some  degree  of  elitism  into   the\r\n\r\nnational  education system, since admission would  depend\r\n\r\nin  part on ability to pay.  Nonetheless, the need for  a\r\n\r\nmore varied education landscape is becoming inevitable in\r\n\r\nthe  face of globalisation and an increasingly mobile and\r\n\r\ninformed citizenry that demands choice.  Privately-funded\r\n\r\nschools are likely to appeal to a minority of parents who\r\n\r\nare  at  odds with the national school system and believe\r\n\r\nthat  their  children could fit better in  a  less  rigid\r\n\r\nalternative system.  Private schools can provide  greater\r\n\r\nvariety  and choice of alternative school systems,  which\r\n\r\ncan  meet  the  needs of such families, and perhaps  help\r\n\r\nstem the outflow of Singaporeans arising from unhappiness\r\n\r\nwith the education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one Douglas Koh quipped, in response to the\r\n\r\nReview  Committee's proposals, \"For  years  I  have  been\r\n\r\nthinking of emigrating because of the lack of alternative\r\n\r\nschool systems.  Now I may be spoilt for choice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, privately-funded schools can cater\r\n\r\nto  the children of returning Singaporean expatriates who\r\n\r\nmay  prefer an alternative curriculum which they are more\r\n\r\nfamiliar with or prepared for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore support this proposal and in fact\r\n\r\nwould  like  to urge MOE to allow private schools  to  be\r\n\r\nopen  for  all  levels  instead  of  confining  this   to\r\n\r\nSecondary  and JC levels so that the diversity in  choice\r\n\r\ncan be complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final key concern relates to widening the\r\n\r\nbenefits,  downwards and upwards.  Firstly, widening  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  downwards.  The recommendations  in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  would  benefit the most able of each cohort.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, the JC review would benefit the top 25% of  the\r\n\r\ncohort, whilst the proposed through-train system is aimed\r\n\r\nat the top 10%.  But what about the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  75%  of  the  cohort?  What  about  those  further\r\n\r\nupstream  in  the  lower secondary and  primary  schools?\r\n\r\nShould  not the new education roadmap of greater breadth,\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility and greater diversity be  also  made\r\n\r\navailable to them so that all will be using the same  map\r\n\r\nto navigate effectively together?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of diversity, flexibility and choice in\r\n\r\neducation and the nurturing of a thinking culture  should\r\n\r\nspread  to  the rest of the cohort so that the less  able\r\n\r\nwill at least receive some preparation to equip them  for\r\n\r\nthe  challenges of the KBE.  For surely the goal  is  not\r\n\r\nmerely  to  have  a thinking elite, but also  a  thinking\r\n\r\nnation.   We  need thinkers at all levels of society  and\r\n\r\nnot  just  at the top, and to level up the weak,  without\r\n\r\ndumping down the strong.  The White Paper has allowed for\r\n\r\ngreater   customisation  or  streaming  with  concomitant\r\n\r\ndiversity  and choice at the top end of the  cohort  with\r\n\r\nthe   through-train  and  specialised  school  proposals.\r\n\r\nGreater  diversity, choice and customisation should  also\r\n\r\nbe  accorded  to  the  rest of the  cohort  and  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I support the following ERC Human Capital  Sub-committee's recommendations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to allow secondary students to have wider\r\n\r\naccess  to subjects beyond their particular stream.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, students in \"N\" level could take a few subjects\r\n\r\nwhere they are strong in at \"O\" level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to allow selected students a longer period\r\n\r\nto  complete their examinations by taking fewer  subjects\r\n\r\nin  more  sittings,  so  that they  can  pursue  external\r\n\r\ninterests  such as sports and the arts, which they  excel\r\n\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These would then reduce some of the rigidity in the\r\n\r\nsystem,   which   though  efficient,  may   hamper   late\r\n\r\ndevelopers.   In  fact, the answer to  the  much-maligned\r\n\r\nstreaming  system could thus paradoxically  lie  in  more\r\n\r\nstreaming   or   greater   customisation   of   learning,\r\n\r\nparticularly  for the exceptional, the  wayward  and  the\r\n\r\njust different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is obviously a great deal of administrative\r\n\r\nclumsiness, and some loss of efficiency may  have  to  be\r\n\r\ninitially\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntolerated   but  fundamentally  -  allowing   even   more\r\n\r\ndiversity should - in this regard be seen as part of  the\r\n\r\nmaturation process in our education system.  The MOE,  by\r\n\r\naccepting  the  White  Paper, is  already  allowing  some\r\n\r\n\"messiness\" to creep into the currently highly  efficient\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, widening the benefits upwards. There is\r\n\r\nalso the need to start grounding critical thinking skills\r\n\r\nfrom  the  echelons of lower secondary and  even  primary\r\n\r\nschool, so that they will not start on the wrong footing.\r\n\r\nAgain,  as  noted by the Human Capital ERC Sub-committee,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  inculcate new traits such as  thinking  and\r\n\r\ncommunication skills early in the education process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to tertiary students, I remember coming\r\n\r\nacross  a T-shirt worn by an undergraduate that  had  the\r\n\r\nwords \"I is a university student.\"  There is some reality\r\n\r\nbehind this tongue-in-cheek humour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an ex-University lecturer, I can testify to the\r\n\r\npoor   command  of  English,  a  significant  number   of\r\n\r\nundergraduates   suffer  from,  as   a   consequence   of\r\n\r\ninadequate  grounding during their primary and  secondary\r\n\r\nschool days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot go far back enough, as psychologists will\r\n\r\ntell  you, habits of the mind are formed at a very  young\r\n\r\nage.  This laying of foundation is especially crucial for\r\n\r\nthe dysfunctional families where the home environment may\r\n\r\nnot  be  conducive for learning and school  is  the  only\r\n\r\navenue for learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE announced the \"Thinking Schools, Learning\r\n\r\nNation\"  initiative  in 1997 and curriculum  content  was\r\n\r\ntrimmed  by up to 30% in 1999.  However, by all accounts,\r\n\r\nand  as  noted earlier, students and parents continue  to\r\n\r\nremain  stressed by the workload, leaving  students  with\r\n\r\nvery little time for critical thinking and analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOE should thus also review the curriculum\r\n\r\ncontent  and  workload of students  in  the  primary  and\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools  to  see if  content  can  be  further\r\n\r\ntrimmed just like in the case of the JCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper notes that the current academic\r\n\r\ncurriculum  load  in  JCs is heavy  compared  to  foreign\r\n\r\neducation systems like the \"A\" levels in the UK  and  the\r\n\r\nIB.   This  is  despite the fact that the curriculum  was\r\n\r\ntrimmed  in  1999.  By the same token, we  may  still  be\r\n\r\noverloading  and over-teaching our primary and  secondary\r\n\r\nstudents.   This,  I submit, could place  incoming  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary/JC  students on the wrong footing and  diminish\r\n\r\nthe  gains they could make from the very revisions we are\r\n\r\nnow debating in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the saying goes, we are the product of what we\r\n\r\neat  and this is true, whether it is food for the stomach\r\n\r\nor fodder for the brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguably, our education system is superior to those\r\n\r\nin  many countries, and has largely met the needs of  our\r\n\r\neconomy  and citizens.  However, with the rapid  pace  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation, there is growing evidence that the system,\r\n\r\nas  it stands, would not be able to meet the needs of the\r\n\r\nfuture workplace and economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prof Edison Liu, Head of the Singapore Genomic\r\n\r\nProgramme notes, \"Yes, the Singapore education system  is\r\n\r\ngood.   Yes, it is considered among the best in the world\r\n\r\nin mathematics and the sciences.  But the question is not\r\n\r\nwhat  Singapore needs now, but what the country will need\r\n\r\n10 years from now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable us to compete effectively in the global\r\n\r\neconomic  arena, we need creative and critically thinking\r\n\r\nworkers,  not  compliant workers.   International  Survey\r\n\r\nResearch  recently reported that based  on  its  employee\r\n\r\nsurveys,  Singapore's chief executives tend  to  be  good\r\n\r\nstewards rather than leaders.  This is corroborated by  a\r\n\r\nrecent  conversation I had with a PR from China who  runs\r\n\r\ntrading companies in Singapore and China.  He told me  he\r\n\r\nspends more time in China than Singapore, not because his\r\n\r\nfamily is in China - his family is in fact in Australia - but because he knows that the Singaporean manager can  be\r\n\r\ntrusted to run his company according to his instructions.\r\n\r\nHe  says  that  if  he  were to leave  his  China  office\r\n\r\nunattended  for too long, he fears one of  his  employees\r\n\r\nmay set up a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrival firm, just across the road, to compete against him.\r\n\r\nHe  remarked that Singaporean managers are very competent\r\n\r\nand  compliant.  Ethics aside, Chinese managers are  also\r\n\r\nvery  competent, but they are also always looking at ways\r\n\r\nto be their own boss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect that our famously rigid education system\r\n\r\nhas  no small part to play in shaping the current mindset\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans.   In  order  to  reform  our  education\r\n\r\nlandscape  to  produce creative workers,  innovators  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, there needs to be a mindset change for all\r\n\r\n-  students,  parents,  teachers  and  the  MOE.   It  is\r\n\r\nheartening   that  the  MOE  has  accepted   the   Review\r\n\r\nCommittee's   recommendation  to  reform   the   JC/Upper\r\n\r\nSecondary  system  to  better prepare  students  for  the\r\n\r\nunpredictable future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the curriculum to allow for more broad-based education and nurturing thinking skills for JC and\r\n\r\nbright  upper secondary school students as well as giving\r\n\r\nthem more options are first steps in the right direction.\r\n\r\nBut the system would also have to be changed upstream and\r\n\r\nfor  the  rest  of the cohort in order to allow  all  and\r\n\r\nsundry - the exceptional, the normal, the wayward and the\r\n\r\njust different - to have a chance to survive and prosper.\r\n\r\nUntil this is done, the Sim Wong Hoos and, if I may  add,\r\n\r\nthe Olivia Lums would continue to remain elusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge MOE not to delay but look into the\r\n\r\nequally  needed  reforms  for  those  upstream  and   the\r\n\r\nremaining   cohort  outside  the  ambit  of   the   upper\r\n\r\nsecondary/JC  system.  This is a call  not  only  by  the\r\n\r\npublic  but  by many from the ERC Sub-committees.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that,  with  determination, MOE would  be  able  to\r\n\r\nmarshall resources to look at these areas simultaneously,\r\n\r\nas  it  is looking into the implementation of the changes\r\n\r\nfor the JC/upper secondary system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it is very comforting to note a recent\r\n\r\nexample  of MOE's eagerness to act decisively.  Proof  of\r\n\r\nthis  is  in the recent change in the choice of secondary\r\n\r\nschool available to pupils after their PSLE results,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstead of before.  Additionally, MOE has also now agreed\r\n\r\nto  a  single JC intake.  As one principal remarked, this\r\n\r\nsingle intake of JC has been fed to MOE for more than  10\r\n\r\nyears  and had remained unchanged.  With MOE's new  added\r\n\r\nwillingness to change, as seen in the acceptance  of  the\r\n\r\nReview Committee's Report, I have high hopes (and I  hope\r\n\r\nI  would  not  be proven wrong) that MOE would  seriously\r\n\r\nconsider  and  implement many of the other  proposed  and\r\n\r\nmuch needed changes in the education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.50 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  parents and some MPs in this  House  have\r\n\r\nbeen highly critical of our education policies.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot  at  all surprising considering the importance Asians\r\n\r\nplace  on  education.  Unfortunately, some of us,  indeed\r\n\r\nmany  of  us,  have a tendency to claim  credit  for  our\r\n\r\nchildren's  success  and  blame  the  system  for   their\r\n\r\nfailure.   But children do not fail until we  think  they\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly in any society, there are slow learners,\r\n\r\nthere  are fast learners.  Education, Sir, is not a race.\r\n\r\nEducation  is  a  journey, and not a  destination.   Yes,\r\n\r\nthere  are  intermediate stops along the way - PSLE,  'O'\r\n\r\nlevels, 'N' levels, and so on, and so forth.  It does not\r\n\r\nreally matter whether a child takes a slightly different,\r\n\r\nif  longer,  route  to reach his own objective,  his  own\r\n\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education, Sir, is not about how fast we reach our\r\n\r\nown  destiny, but how far we can do so.  MOE, in the last\r\n\r\ndecade  or so, has become a convenient punching  bag  for\r\n\r\nsociety's distorted definition of success.  Really, a lot\r\n\r\nof  the noise we hear in this House and the media do  not\r\n\r\ndo  justice to our system here.  They are both unfair and\r\n\r\nwithout basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system is not perfect. I think there are\r\n\r\ndefects.  But the system is not broken.  The way we  hear\r\n\r\nit in this House is that it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  almost  broken.   But I say that the  system  is  not\r\n\r\nbroken  and this is saying plenty about our system versus\r\n\r\nthe  systems elsewhere.  Dr Wang mentioned the  standards\r\n\r\nin  the  States and Britain.  I will come back to that  a\r\n\r\nbit later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many countries, including the States and Britain,\r\n\r\nare  revamping their systems because scholastic standards\r\n\r\nhave  fallen  to disastrously low levels.  Here,  we  are\r\n\r\nfixing a problem that does not exist.  It is a successful\r\n\r\nproblem.  Our students do well.  There are lots of As  in\r\n\r\nthe  'A' levels and we say that there is something  wrong\r\n\r\nin  that system.  Here, the MOE is revamping the  JC  and\r\n\r\nupper  secondary  school system  for  quite  a  different\r\n\r\nreason  from that now going on in the States, in  Britain\r\n\r\nand in Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new system, many parents have the\r\n\r\nperception that the system is going to be easy  on  their\r\n\r\nchildren.   There is hope that more students in Singapore\r\n\r\nunder  the  new system will be better off.  I think  they\r\n\r\nwill  be.   But  there will also be a lot of  heartaches.\r\n\r\nBecause under the new system, there is a higher degree of\r\n\r\ndifferentiation, as Dr Amy Khor mentioned.  It  is  in  a\r\n\r\nway  another level of streaming, if you put the  students\r\n\r\nthrough a through-train system, if the students went into\r\n\r\nthe   specialised  school  of  Mathematics  and   Science\r\n\r\n(something which I will talk about a bit later on).   MPs\r\n\r\nand  educators  cannot be oblivious to the events  around\r\n\r\nthe  world.   And  we seem to be very focused  about  the\r\n\r\nsystem  in Singapore when we talk about the problem.   We\r\n\r\nall know the problems.  But if you look around elsewhere,\r\n\r\nthe  problems  we  have, the problems we  face,  are  not\r\n\r\nserious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only two years ago at the 2000 Presidential election\r\n\r\ncampaign  in  the  States, education was  what  Americans\r\n\r\ncalled a \"hot button issue\", in other words, something so\r\n\r\nhot,  it  would  decide who would be the next  President.\r\n\r\nWhy?   Because  an  employers' survey  showed  that  two-thirds,  that  means,  more  than  60%  of  high   school\r\n\r\ngraduates  (we  call it 'A' levels,  they  call  it  high\r\n\r\nschool)  did not have the skills necessary to succeed  in\r\n\r\nthe workplace.  Indeed, Americans have decried, debating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  declining standards in schools for over two decades.\r\n\r\nSo has Britain, so has Japan.  And on balance, I think we\r\n\r\nhave done well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media, the press and academics should know\r\n\r\nbetter.   How do we know we have done well?  I think  the\r\n\r\nbest  test  is  to  benchmark our system  versus  systems\r\n\r\nelsewhere.   And I think the best objective  benchmarking\r\n\r\nis  the International Mathematics and Science test  which\r\n\r\nis  culturally  neutral.   It  does  not  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nperson's  language or his upbringing, and the  system  is\r\n\r\ntotally  objective.  The sample sizes are  large  enough.\r\n\r\nThe  number  of countries participating is representative\r\n\r\nenough.   But  therein  lies the problem.   Parents  cite\r\n\r\ncompetition and, here, we have heard two speakers  before\r\n\r\nme  saying  competition is a major fault of our education\r\n\r\nsystem.   I think in particular, parents and many  of  us\r\n\r\nhere  are against ranking because they think that ranking\r\n\r\nengenders   a   culture  of  what  we  call  \"destructive\r\n\r\ncompetition\".  The real reason, if we touch  our  hearts,\r\n\r\nis   not  competition  or  ranking,  but  the  fear   and\r\n\r\ndisappointment  that our sons and daughters  do  not  get\r\n\r\ninto  a ranked school.  I think that is the heart of  the\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all of us want to send our sons and daughters to\r\n\r\nschools  that can only take in 10% of every cohort,  then\r\n\r\nby  definition 90% of the parents of that cohort will  be\r\n\r\ndisappointed.  But is this necessary?  The hysteria about\r\n\r\nnot  getting  into a ranked school like RI, RGS,  Chinese\r\n\r\nHigh,  is totally irrational.  All our secondary  schools\r\n\r\nare not bad.  It is just that, if you have a spread of  a\r\n\r\nfew  hundred  schools, there must be some better  schools\r\n\r\nand some not so good schools.  But the real test is if  a\r\n\r\nstudent  that does not get into a ranked school, does  he\r\n\r\nmeasure up to international scholastic benchmarks?  If he\r\n\r\ndoes, I think it is not a problem.  If he does not,  then\r\n\r\nthere is a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please remember, as Dr Wang correctly pointed out,\r\n\r\nthat our students are held in high esteem when they go to\r\n\r\nBritish  or  American  universities,  many  of  them  get\r\n\r\nexemption.   Every student here does well  in  very  good\r\n\r\nuniversities  anywhere in the world.  It will  of  course\r\n\r\nmake parents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhappy,  if  MOE does not rank schools.  But I think  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  a  retrograde step.  Competition and  ranking,\r\n\r\nusing  examination  results, are part  of  the  education\r\n\r\nlandscape  everywhere.   I  think  Singapore  is  a  late\r\n\r\nstarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, critics equate ranking using examination\r\n\r\nresults as destructive competition.  But, elsewhere, they\r\n\r\nhave   changed   euphemism.    They   call   examinations\r\n\r\naccountability.  You might ask: accountability  to  whom?\r\n\r\nTo  taxpayers who fund public schools, or to parents  who\r\n\r\nwant  to know which private schools are good so that they\r\n\r\ncan  spend a lot of money to send their children to these\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around the developed world, there is an urgency\r\n\r\nto  get scholastic achievements up.  In Chicago, you read\r\n\r\nnot  long  ago  in  the Straits Times, the  authority  is\r\n\r\ngiving  away  cash grants of US$10,000 to  schools  which\r\n\r\nimprove  on  their  grades.  Some schools  in  Texas  are\r\n\r\ncutting  down on play time and recess time  to  focus  on\r\n\r\ncore  examinable  skills.  In Japan,  educationists  have\r\n\r\nfound that years of education that give children room  to\r\n\r\ngrow, what Japanese call \"the zest of life\", in the  last\r\n\r\n12 years have left a serious gap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just distributed a paper which, according to\r\n\r\nthe   opinion   of  four  Japanese  scholars   in   Tokyo\r\n\r\nUniversity,   is   called  \"The  Truth  About   Declining\r\n\r\nScholastic Achievement\", a long paper, but just read  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  and the conclusion and you  will  know  the\r\n\r\nmessage.  There is a simple Mathematics test inside  here\r\n\r\nand  you  are expected to score 90 marks.  The conclusion\r\n\r\nof  these  four Japanese scholars is that 12  years  ago,\r\n\r\nthey did a survey, they found that the students, like our\r\n\r\nstudents  today, spent a lot of time studying.  They  got\r\n\r\ngood  grades,  but the parents were not  happy.   So  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education then changed the system towards the\r\n\r\nAmerican system, more broad-based, more electives and the\r\n\r\nresults  had  not been welcomed at least  by  these  four\r\n\r\nscholars.   Their  argument  is  that  basic  Mathematics\r\n\r\nscores  had  fallen by up to 10 points.   Where  students\r\n\r\nused to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  70-80  marks for the test shown inside  here,  today\r\n\r\nthey  are  getting 50-60 marks.  Their argument  is  that\r\n\r\nstandards had fallen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go on to America which many of you have more\r\n\r\nknowledge.  Now, after years of laissez-faire and falling\r\n\r\nacademic  standards,  the  state  of  Massachusetts   has\r\n\r\nmandated that all public high school graduates must pass,\r\n\r\nwhat  they  now  call,  the  Massachusetts  Comprehensive\r\n\r\nAssessment System in order to get a High School  Diploma.\r\n\r\nBefore  that,  there  was no examination.   Every  school\r\n\r\ngraduate,  they take the SAT, then they go to university.\r\n\r\nBut  now,  in  the state of Massachusetts,  they  want  a\r\n\r\nstandardised testing on core subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature abhors a vacuum. If Singapore Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not  rank  schools, somebody or  some  organisation\r\n\r\nwould, because the public is hungry for information.   In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the Ministry of Education ranks schools.   In\r\n\r\nthe  state  of  Massachusetts, they do not rank  schools.\r\n\r\nBut they publish the results obtained by the students  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  schools.  And what happens?  The  local  media\r\n\r\nfixes up these results, does the analysis and publishes a\r\n\r\nranking list.  The Financial Times publishes an education\r\n\r\nsupplement  every  year,  ranking  all  the  schools   in\r\n\r\nBritain, sometime around August/September before the term\r\n\r\nstarts.  It is a special pull-out, by the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, although MOE ranks schools, it does\r\n\r\nnot  publish detailed results - RI gets how  many  As  in\r\n\r\nHistory,  how  many As in Mathematics.  In the  state  of\r\n\r\nVictoria,  you might be surprised, and in many states  in\r\n\r\nAustralia,  detailed  subject  results  are  published  - Melbourne High get so many As in Mathematics, so many  Bs\r\n\r\nin Science.  Although they did not rank schools, one look\r\n\r\nat  the  results you will know which is the best  school,\r\n\r\nwhich is the not-so-good school.  So ranking is universal\r\n\r\nby  different  names, if you like.  And  we  should  keep\r\n\r\nranking  and competition in its proper perspective.   The\r\n\r\ncompetition  we  face in Singapore is not  internal,  but\r\n\r\nreally  external.  By that, I mean it is not  competition\r\n\r\nbetween an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRI  boy and a Chinese High and an ACS boy, or between RJC\r\n\r\nand  Hwa Chong and ACJC.  Sure, we want them to have some\r\n\r\nfriendly  competition so that they have sparring partners\r\n\r\nand  benchmark  each other.  But the real competition  is\r\n\r\nbetween  us  and foreign systems.  It is  only  when  the\r\n\r\nentire  local  system is levelled up and  superior  to  a\r\n\r\nforeign  system that we collectively stand  a  chance  of\r\n\r\nmaking ourselves relevant in the brave new world, in  the\r\n\r\nnew  economy.   To put it bluntly, collectively,  are  we\r\n\r\nbetter  off  than our neighbours?  Collectively,  are  we\r\n\r\nbetter  off than the world?  If the answer is no to  both\r\n\r\nthese  questions, we would not arrive in the new economy.\r\n\r\nWe will arrive somewhere between here and Timbuktu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents also take issue with the unforgiving and\r\n\r\nelitist system which streams students according to  their\r\n\r\nlearning  abilities.  We have heard a lot in this  House.\r\n\r\nMany think that the solution is to do away with streaming\r\n\r\nand  follow the example of, say, the USA where  everybody\r\n\r\nhappily travels on the same education train from Grade 1,\r\n\r\nwhich  is Primary 1, to Grade 12, or JC 2.  But  this  is\r\n\r\nnot  utopia.   In  fact,  the  US  is  trying  to  fix  a\r\n\r\nfundamental problem of failing schools in what they  call\r\n\r\nthis  one-class, one \"slow train\" system, where everybody\r\n\r\ngoes on one train - no First Class, no Business Class, no\r\n\r\nEconomy - and travels on the same train from Grade  1  to\r\n\r\nGrade 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will give me a few minutes,\r\n\r\nI  shall  trace  the  short history  of  the  US  system,\r\n\r\nstarting  from 1986, so that we get a better appreciation\r\n\r\nof  the  work of the Ministry of Education and understand\r\n\r\nwhy,  when we compare ourselves to America, the  students\r\n\r\nthere have a lot less homework and content.  The question\r\n\r\nwe want to ask is: do we want to travel that way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US system has undergone fundamental changes. Up\r\n\r\nuntil  the 1950s, the school system in the US was  a  bit\r\n\r\nlike ours - maybe not so competitive, but a bit like ours\r\n\r\n-  they had examinations, core subjects and few electives\r\n\r\nin  high  schools.  Then, in the 1960s and 1970s,  hippie\r\n\r\nculture took over, America went to war,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   public  demanded,  and  the  state  provided,  more\r\n\r\nchoices.   By  the 1980s, parents and educators  realised\r\n\r\nthat  it  could  be  a  mistake.   Choices  and  lack  of\r\n\r\nexaminations had eroded standards seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did they know? American students' score in\r\n\r\ntheir  standardised  tests  on mathematics,  reading  and\r\n\r\nsciences  became  lower and lower.   At  the  same  time,\r\n\r\ncollege  professors and administrators  began  to  notice\r\n\r\nthat  high school graduates could not read, write  or  do\r\n\r\nbasic  arithmetic.   In  short, a large  number  of  high\r\n\r\nschool graduates were intellectually incompetent in  what\r\n\r\nthey call the 3Rs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a survey in 1980, 99% of Americans told the\r\n\r\ncensus  takers  that they were literate.   In  fact,  the\r\n\r\neducators knew they lied.  Based on the 1989 survey,  12%\r\n\r\nof  America's  high  school graduates were  \"functionally\r\n\r\nilliterate\".   What does that mean?  It means  that  they\r\n\r\ncould not understand printed instructions and could not - would you believe it - fill out a job application!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many reasons for the sad state of\r\n\r\naffairs.   Among them were the abolition of core courses,\r\n\r\nproliferation of electives and very few examinations.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  many  schools had no examinations, and those  that\r\n\r\nhad examinations had simple examinations - what they call\r\n\r\na  \"dumbing down\" of the curriculum.  If you  go  to  any\r\n\r\nbookshop today, you will see that some of the bestsellers\r\n\r\nin computer and lifestyle books are in what they call the\r\n\r\n\"dummy series\".  A lot of these dummy series books became\r\n\r\nvery popular, because the system was levelled down to the\r\n\r\nlowest  common  denominator so that everybody  could  get\r\n\r\nvery good grades, go home with the feel-good factor,  and\r\n\r\nevery  parent could pat his/her child and say, \"Son,  you\r\n\r\nhave done well.  Congratulations!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all of us know of children with average grades\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  who  have suddenly blossomed  in  overseas\r\n\r\nschools.  Obviously, this could not have happened in just\r\n\r\na few months or years.  Yet, such experiences are common.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Perhaps, we have levelled up a lot while they have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndumbed down a lot.  So, when you cross over, you are like\r\n\r\na  leopard  cat which suddenly becomes a leopard!   These\r\n\r\nexperiences  vindicate the success  of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  and speak volumes about the high standards  of\r\n\r\nour system here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, the issue of falling standards became an\r\n\r\nissue.  Ex-President George Bush and the Governors of all\r\n\r\nthe 50 states moved for a root-and-branch change - unlike\r\n\r\nthe review we are talking about today, which is tempering\r\n\r\nat  the edges.  The changes are substantial, but I do not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  a root-and-branch change.  In  America  in\r\n\r\n1989,  Ex-President  George Bush  and  the  50  Governors\r\n\r\ndecided  to  do  a root-and-branch change  of  the  whole\r\n\r\nsystem,  and  Congress gave effect to what  is  known  as\r\n\r\n\"Goals  2000\"  - not football but education.   And  Goals\r\n\r\n2000  was  given teeth when Congress approved Goals  2000\r\n\r\nand  gave  additional federal grants for  all  states  to\r\n\r\nreach  six objectives.  Perhaps we should look  at  these\r\n\r\nsix objectives and measure them against what the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education is trying to do today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 1: That all children must start school, ready\r\n\r\nto  learn.  We must ask ourselves, do Singapore  children\r\n\r\nstart school ready to learn?  The answer is yes;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 2: That 90% of all high school students will\r\n\r\ngraduate;   it  does not matter what age, but  they  will\r\n\r\ngraduate;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 3: That all students will achieve competence\r\n\r\nin core subjects at certain key points in their progress.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, when you have a high school diploma, you\r\n\r\nare  supposed  to  reach  the standards  set  by  certain\r\n\r\nauthorities, and not a diploma that means nothing;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 4: That American students will be the first in\r\n\r\nthe  world in mathematics and science achievement.   That\r\n\r\nwas  a  key goal, because they think that for America  to\r\n\r\nlead the world, American students must be the first - not\r\n\r\nsecond,  not  third  - in the world  in  mathematics  and\r\n\r\nscience achievements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 5: That every American will be literate and\r\n\r\nhave  the  skills  to function as a citizen  and  worker.\r\n\r\nHere,  we talk about thinker, innovator, creator.   Their\r\n\r\ngoals  are very simple - every American will be  literate\r\n\r\nand have the skills to function as a citizen and worker - in other words, be functionally literate.  A simple goal;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 6: This goal is something we have no problem\r\n\r\nwith:   That  all  schools will  be  free  of  drugs  and\r\n\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move from 1986 to the year 2000, when\r\n\r\nPresident  George  W Bush ran for elections  and  was  so\r\n\r\ndisillusioned with the system.  His father,  Ex-President\r\n\r\nGeorge Bush had set Goals 2000.  In 2000, George W  Bush,\r\n\r\nJr,  ran  as a candidate and said that he was  not  happy\r\n\r\nwith  the  system.   It had achieved  some  but  had  not\r\n\r\nachieved a lot.  His key quotation was: \"I would shine  a\r\n\r\nspotlight  of  shame on failure\".  The Americans  do  not\r\n\r\nlike  to shame students.  They always tell their students\r\n\r\nhow good they are, that they have done well.  But he says\r\n\r\nthat  that  is  not good enough.  If the student  is  not\r\n\r\ngood,  better  shame him.  That is the only  way  to  get\r\n\r\nstandards up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation got quite bad, and the American\r\n\r\npoliticians, both Gore and Clinton, engaged on the issue.\r\n\r\nThey were particularly displeased perhaps that it was not\r\n\r\nAmericans who were the first in mathematics and  science,\r\n\r\nbut  that it was tiny little Singapore that was first  in\r\n\r\nmathematics  and  second in science.  I think  we  should\r\n\r\ncongratulate our students, parents and educators for this\r\n\r\nsingular   achievement.   Clearly,  forgiving  everybody,\r\n\r\nmaking the syllabus simple, putting everybody in the same\r\n\r\ncoach  class  travelling  in the  same  slow  coach,  and\r\n\r\ndumbing  down  the curriculum is a choice we  should  not\r\n\r\nventure  into.  It will make parents happy if  we  rename\r\n\r\nthe  schools  and have, say, 20 Raffles Institutions,  20\r\n\r\nRaffles  Girls Schools, 20 Chinese Highs,  etc.   We  can\r\n\r\nfool ourselves, but the world will not be deceived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correct approach is that taken by the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education.  Differentiate the students not because we\r\n\r\ncondemn them but because we want to help them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent students have different needs.  They come  from\r\n\r\ndifferent   backgrounds,  with  different   talents   and\r\n\r\ninterests.  We should put them into different trains  and\r\n\r\ndrive at a speed that they are comfortable with, but when\r\n\r\nthey  reach  a certain destination, they are expected  to\r\n\r\nachieve   the  kind  of  results  that  that  destination\r\n\r\ndemands.   However,  overall, if we take  the  sum  total\r\n\r\nspeed  of  all the trains, that train must  travel  at  a\r\n\r\nspeed fast enough for us to enter the new economy.  There\r\n\r\nis  a  break-through speed.  If we are too slow, we  will\r\n\r\nnever arrive, because the world has moved on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow learners need help. They do not need help by\r\n\r\nadults stigmatising them.  There is nothing wrong with  a\r\n\r\nslow  learner arriving at \"O\" or \"A\" level a  little  bit\r\n\r\nlater.  The fact that they have arrived is something that\r\n\r\nwe  should  applaud and not condemn.  If we  put  a  slow\r\n\r\nlearner  on  a fast train, he or she would fall  off  the\r\n\r\ntrain.  If we drive a slow train for a fast learner,  the\r\n\r\npassenger would fall asleep.  A slow train which  arrives\r\n\r\nlate is better than one which arrives empty.  But can  we\r\n\r\nput everybody on board and drive a slow train?  Then,  we\r\n\r\nwill have the American problem, which they are trying  to\r\n\r\nfix, and we should not move ourselves into that system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for slow learners, I think the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  has  found  a solution.   If  we  support  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education and the students  who  have  some\r\n\r\ndifficulty learning, I think they will be all right.   If\r\n\r\nwe keep talking about it, the stigma that the students in\r\n\r\nthe \"N\" stream and the 3-year Pre-U classes feel today is\r\n\r\nlargely  imposed by society.  Who comprise society?   You\r\n\r\nand I, parents.  Collectively, we are at fault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For slow learners, I think the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nhas the solution.  It is more difficult to coach the most\r\n\r\ntalented,  and  there are very few  of  these  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I always hope that the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\ncould do a little bit more for the most talented, not  by\r\n\r\nteaching them more - because probably they know more than\r\n\r\nthe  teachers - but by giving them the right  environment\r\n\r\nand creating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  right  mood.  Those extraordinary men and women  who\r\n\r\nare  good in academic work, sports, dance, music and  the\r\n\r\narts, they need a different kind of education altogether.\r\n\r\nYou  might ask, \"Why do we need to help them?   They  are\r\n\r\nalready  so good.\"  The answer is: because they  are  our\r\n\r\nhope.  They are our salvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I am very pleased with the recommendation of\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  to establish these so-called  specialised\r\n\r\nschools.  However, I would like to counsel, like the  two\r\n\r\nhon.  Members before me that, in a way, this is a  higher\r\n\r\nform  of  streaming,  a higher form  of  differentiation.\r\n\r\nChildren  who get into these specialised schools  may  be\r\n\r\nfew,   and   children  who  cannot  get   in   may   feel\r\n\r\ndisappointed.  This should not be the case.  But I  think\r\n\r\nthere is a need for such schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education mentioned two of these\r\n\r\nschools  -  Bronx High School of Science  and  Stuyvesant\r\n\r\nHigh School.  Maybe I can just mention a little bit about\r\n\r\nthese  specialised schools in New York  City,  which  are\r\n\r\nreally in a class of their very own.  Among the ruins  of\r\n\r\nthe state high school education system in New York, there\r\n\r\nare jewels in the squalor.  When we drill deeper into the\r\n\r\nAmerican  system, we have to recognise that  the  average\r\n\r\nstudent is an academic laggard, but there is a tiny slice\r\n\r\nof  the community which is exceptionally brilliant.   But\r\n\r\nbecause they have a big population base, that tiny  slice\r\n\r\nis enough to pull America forward to be the most powerful\r\n\r\nnation  today.  This is not surprising, where you have  a\r\n\r\nlarge  pool  of  laggards and a small  number  of  highly\r\n\r\ntalented people because, if you had been to a desert, you\r\n\r\nwould  understand that it is only in a desert that  there\r\n\r\nare oases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New York City Specialised High School System is\r\n\r\nsomething  in a class of its own.  In fact, in  New  York\r\n\r\nCity,   there  are  three  of  these  schools   and   one\r\n\r\nspecialised high school in dance and music.  New  Yorkers\r\n\r\ncall  these \"specialised schools\", but actually it is  an\r\n\r\neuphemism  for very elite schools.  These  are  the  best\r\n\r\nschools.  They are also public schools.  Students who get\r\n\r\nin, get free tuition.  It is in these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools - three mathematics and science schools, and  one\r\n\r\nmusic  and  dance  school - that the future  captains  of\r\n\r\nindustry in New York City are being groomed for tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a specialised school, not just for\r\n\r\nmathematics  and science but also maybe  for  sports  and\r\n\r\nmusic,  is  an  idea whose time has come  for  Singapore,\r\n\r\nprecisely  because  our talent pool is  very  thin,  even\r\n\r\nthough the average standard of the student population  is\r\n\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education mentioned that the\r\n\r\nspecialised  schools have the Integrated  Programme  that\r\n\r\nstarts  from  Grade 9 all the way to Grade 12,  ie,  from\r\n\r\nSecondary  3  to  JC 2. The schools are  prohibited  from\r\n\r\ntaking  in  students  on any other basis.   So,  sometime\r\n\r\naround  October, the New York City Council will set  what\r\n\r\nthey  call the Specialised Science High Schools Admission\r\n\r\nTest  (SSHSAT) - SATS is too easy for these  kids  -  and\r\n\r\nstudents  who  score  the  highest  will  be  ranked  and\r\n\r\nstreamed to these four specialised high schools.  Neither\r\n\r\nwealth,  prestige nor power will open the door  to  these\r\n\r\nschools for the child.  The child must get in on  his  or\r\n\r\nher own merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would think that these three high schools in New\r\n\r\nYork  City  -  at least the mathematics and science  high\r\n\r\nschools  - get their cream from all the states.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot  the case, not even from the whole of New York State.\r\n\r\nThey  only get the cream from New York City which, as  we\r\n\r\nknow,  consists  of  five boroughs.   So  the  population\r\n\r\ncatchment  of  New  York  City  is  something  like  9-10\r\n\r\nmillion.   In  other words, each specialised high  school\r\n\r\nonly  gets from a catchment of three million.  In a  way,\r\n\r\nit  is  like  Bronx Science getting from  three  million,\r\n\r\nsimilar  to RI getting from the whole of Singapore.   But\r\n\r\nif  we  were  to  benchmark  RI's  academic  achievements\r\n\r\nagainst  Bronx Science's, then we are comparing  a  dwarf\r\n\r\nversus a giant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bronx Science alone has produced five Nobel Prize\r\n\r\nwinners.   Stuyvesant High has produced two  Nobel  Prize\r\n\r\nwinners and one Field Medallist.  A Field Medal is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNobel  Prize for Mathematics.   Brooklyn Tech,  which  is\r\n\r\nthe other specialised high school, has produced two Nobel\r\n\r\nPrize  winners.   So, together, they have  produced  nine\r\n\r\nNobel  Prize and one Field Medal winners.  Just  imagine,\r\n\r\n1.3  billion  Chinese have produced only six Nobel  Prize\r\n\r\nwinners!   So,  these three schools are  outstanding  and\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  that old.  The oldest is only  about  100\r\n\r\nyears old.  Bronx Science is about 70-80 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we need to give our brightest students the\r\n\r\nbest  environment.   If we can create  a  Bronx  Science,\r\n\r\nBrooklyn  Tech  or a Stuyvesant High in our  backyard,  I\r\n\r\nthink Singapore has great hopes for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards in these schools are extremely high and\r\n\r\nthe  standards and the hours spent in the schools are  so\r\n\r\nhigh that Singapore parents will scream for mercy if  any\r\n\r\nof   their  children  went  there.   Brooklyn  Tech,  for\r\n\r\nexample, sets the passing mark at 65 marks. That is  only\r\n\r\nthe  passing mark.   The average mark is 75 marks.   That\r\n\r\nis what they call the recommended grade.  Brookyln Tech's\r\n\r\ngraduating class last year (2001) won scholarships to Ivy\r\n\r\nLeague,  to all the good universities, totalling  us  $36\r\n\r\nmillion worth of scholarships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to graduate from Brooklyn Tech, you need 44\r\n\r\ncredit  points,  versus 40 credit points across  the  New\r\n\r\nYork  State system.  But most Brooklyn Tech students take\r\n\r\n50  credit points.  It is an outstanding school where the\r\n\r\npressure is so great that no Singapore school, I believe,\r\n\r\nand  I  am an RI alumni and I am ashamed to say  that  RI\r\n\r\ndoes  not  measure up to Brooklyn Tech or  Stuyvesant  or\r\n\r\nBronx Science.  The focus that we are asking students  to\r\n\r\nspend too much time on the curriculum is not wrong but we\r\n\r\nhave it in focus, because in America, the very best spend\r\n\r\na  lot  more time on the core subjects.  When we  measure\r\n\r\nagainst them, we are just out-classed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly recommend the establishment of a\r\n\r\nSpecialised  High School of Mathematics and  Science  for\r\n\r\nthe  reasons that I have enumerated.  But whether  it  is\r\n\r\nbest supervised by NUS is something I am not sure.  Bronx\r\n\r\nScience  is  not  under  the  supervision  of  New   York\r\n\r\nUniversity (NYU)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  Columbia  University but it had a dedicated  founding\r\n\r\nprincipal, Dr Morris Mester.  I think the champion agency\r\n\r\nis  important  but it is not the over-riding  importance.\r\n\r\nThe  most  important  factor is  a  champion  himself  or\r\n\r\nherself,  the  principal must be totally  passionate  and\r\n\r\ndedicated to the cause of specialised education.   In the\r\n\r\nSpecialised  High School of Mathematics and Science,  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  should  not  just focus  on  Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nScience alone.  As in the three specialised high schools,\r\n\r\nthey do a broad spectrum of other subjects and there  are\r\n\r\npeople  who  come  out from those schools  who  are  non-scientists,  for  example,  William  Safire  from   Bronx\r\n\r\nScience - he is a writer.  Then you have got people  like\r\n\r\nLucy Liu of Charlie Angels fame.  She is from Stuyvesant.\r\n\r\nThese  are  people  who  did  not  pursue  a  course   in\r\n\r\nMathematics  and  Science  and  become  Nobel   laureates\r\n\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also agree with the recommendation to set up\r\n\r\na  Specialised School of Music and Dance.  But  here,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  be realistic.  We may not have enough  critical\r\n\r\nmass  to  start here.  If we can have the critical  mass,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no harm because it is an area that  we  should\r\n\r\npursue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many high schools in the developed countries have,\r\n\r\nwhat  the  media calls, the through-train  system.   That\r\n\r\nmeans  you start from Secondary One and finish at  JC  2.\r\n\r\nThe  Australians  call it Year 7 to  Year  12.  But  this\r\n\r\napproach  is premised on the fact that when  you  are  on\r\n\r\nthis through-train, you want to enter university, in  the\r\n\r\nsense that the JC 2 examination, the Year 12 examination,\r\n\r\nis  a university entrance examination.  But some students\r\n\r\nmay  not  want to travel this train.   Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\ncorrect  that  there is no necessity for all  schools  to\r\n\r\nimplement this system.  Some students may not want to  go\r\n\r\nto  university.   They may want to pursue sports,  music.\r\n\r\nSome may want to change train after Secondary 4 to go  to\r\n\r\nthe  polytechnic.  Some may want to go overseas.   It  is\r\n\r\nuseful to keep the \"O\" level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect that in our system, some of the students\r\n\r\non the through-train might quietly sit for the \"O\" levels\r\n\r\nalso.  There\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a  good  reason  for it because today,  a  small  but\r\n\r\ngrowing  number  of \"O\" level students  are  sitting  for\r\n\r\ntheir SAT and they are proceeding to good universities in\r\n\r\nAmerica  to  finish off their degrees.   We  should  give\r\n\r\nstudents  more choices.  Choice is always  a  good  thing\r\n\r\nprovided  that  it does not dumb down the curriculum,  it\r\n\r\ndoes not trim the content of the core subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review also recommended, in a quite substantial\r\n\r\nway,  on broadening the syllabus to provide more choices.\r\n\r\nThis  is a good recommendation.   If the \"A\" level has  a\r\n\r\nchink in the armour, it is that it is too narrowly based.\r\n\r\nIt  is all right for good students who want to specialise\r\n\r\nin  the universities and make up their minds at 18  years\r\n\r\nold.   But if you are not very sure, and you are  groping\r\n\r\naround,   then   the  broader  base   system   would   be\r\n\r\nrecommended.   As  in many systems in the  past  in  many\r\n\r\ncountries, when you move from a core system to  a  broad-based  system,  contents are inevitably  diluted  because\r\n\r\nthere  are  certain  fixed  hours  that  students  attend\r\n\r\nschools  for.  It is important that when we move  from  a\r\n\r\ncore \"A\" level today, with four or five principal levels,\r\n\r\nto  a  broad-based  system we should not  trim  down  the\r\n\r\ncontent  of the core subjects too much. Core subjects,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say, on the academic side, are languages,  English\r\n\r\nis  a  must.  For mother tongue, not many of us  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  grasp  the  two languages but  those  who  can,\r\n\r\nshould.  Mathematics and Science are a must.  With  these\r\n\r\nthree core subjects - language, Mathematics and Science - you  can branch into most electives.  Most electives  are\r\n\r\nknowledge-based and if you are good in language, you  can\r\n\r\ndo  English Literature.  If you are good in logic and you\r\n\r\ncan  understand  a  lot of things and the  foundation  of\r\n\r\nthese  is  Mathematics, Science and Language.  The  right\r\n\r\nmix  between  core  and electives is a bit  difficult  to\r\n\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned the Japanese experience. They\r\n\r\nmoved  from core to broad-based, the dumbing down of  the\r\n\r\nMathematics curriculum.  I would like to urge MOE to be a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  careful  here.  Whether  the  \"A\"  level  is\r\n\r\nsuperior to the International Baccalaureate, opinions are\r\n\r\ndivided.  I think there is no harm trying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nboth  systems  and let students have a choice.   Whatever\r\n\r\nsystem, I hope we will achieve excellence either  in  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevel or in the IP system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, I commend the Ministry of Education for\r\n\r\nmoving ahead.  I believe that this review is not premised\r\n\r\non  the  basis that the present system has problems.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  are  moving from a very strong platform  to  a\r\n\r\nhigher level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.22 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support\r\n\r\nof the motion standing in the name of RAdm Teo Chee Hean,\r\n\r\nMinister for Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recently returned from a trip to China.\r\n\r\nThere is now a very popular phrase in China, and that is,\r\n\r\n\"yu  shi ju jin\" - progressing with time.  Sir, the world\r\n\r\nis  changing very fast, much faster now than before,  and\r\n\r\nthe  education system must also change for us to keep  up\r\n\r\nwith the changing times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiatives and proposals contained in the\r\n\r\nreport  of the Junior College and Upper Secondary  School\r\n\r\nEducation Review Committee are bold and wide-ranging.  If\r\n\r\nimplemented, they will significantly change our  approach\r\n\r\nto  education.   Historically, our education  system  has\r\n\r\nbeen  based  on a highly structured approach.   Over  the\r\n\r\nyears, we have sought to gradually open up our system  to\r\n\r\nallow for variety and some experimentation.  Now, we  are\r\n\r\nready  for  a  major quantum leap.  The impact  of  these\r\n\r\nproposals  before  us  will  be  far  reaching  and  long\r\n\r\nlasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree with the overall concept and\r\n\r\napproach  proposed by the White Paper, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nmake  several observations and I hope the Ministry  could\r\n\r\ntake  them  into  account  when  implementing  these  new\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the proposed changes depends\r\n\r\ncritically  on the implementation process.   Firstly,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  prepare our teachers, students and parents  for\r\n\r\nthese  major changes in the JC curriculum that have  been\r\n\r\nproposed.  The broadening of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   curriculum  will  undoubtedly  better  prepare  our\r\n\r\nstudents  for the university education and  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  of the fast-changing world we  now  live  in.\r\n\r\nHowever,  as  these changes are quite significant,  there\r\n\r\nmay  be a need to prepare the students even during  their\r\n\r\nupper  secondary  school days so  that  they  are  better\r\n\r\nprepared  for the broader curriculum.  In this regard,  I\r\n\r\nam  glad  that  the report has recognised  the  potential\r\n\r\nupstream  impact on the secondary schools.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  urge  the  Ministry  to  also  look  into  the  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary  school  curriculum and make adjustments  where\r\n\r\nnecessary to help students adapt to the new system in the\r\n\r\nJCs.   For  example,  some modules of the  Knowledge  and\r\n\r\nInquiry could be introduced to the students in the  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary schools so that they will be more familiar with\r\n\r\nthe subject when they enter into the JC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, some students, especially the slower\r\n\r\nones, may find the broadened curriculum more difficult to\r\n\r\nhandle.  These difficulties may be more acute during  the\r\n\r\ntransition  period  when  the  new  curriculum  is  first\r\n\r\nintroduced  as  it  would take some time  for  things  to\r\n\r\nsettle down and for the students and teachers to get used\r\n\r\nto the new system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help them cope better, additional time and\r\n\r\nattention  may need to be provided to coach them  and  to\r\n\r\nhelp them catch up. The schools could help identify these\r\n\r\nweaker  students  and  consider providing  some  form  of\r\n\r\nlearning support.  This is particularly useful during the\r\n\r\nfirst  one  or two years when the changes are introduced.\r\n\r\nIt  will also help assure our parents that their children\r\n\r\nwill be able to benefit from the new approach rather than\r\n\r\nto suffer from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers, on the other hand, will need time to\r\n\r\nadjust  to a more skilled based system.  As new  subjects\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  Knowledge and Inquiry will be  introduced,\r\n\r\nteachers  will  need to understand the new  requirements.\r\n\r\nSome  may  need  to  change their  teaching  methods  and\r\n\r\nacquire  new  teaching skills.  They  may  also  need  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  new  ways  of  assessing the  students.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore crucial that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinistry prepares and trains the teachers so that the new\r\n\r\ncurriculum can be implemented effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers at the upper secondary levels also have a\r\n\r\nvital role to play as a bridge to help advise and counsel\r\n\r\ntheir  students  so that they in turn can  make  informed\r\n\r\ndecisions  on  the  subjects  they  intend  to  take  up.\r\n\r\nParents,  in  particular, may also need to  be  similarly\r\n\r\nbriefed and counselled beforehand.  It would therefore be\r\n\r\nhelpful  if  the  Ministry  could  consider  providing  a\r\n\r\nbriefing for the secondary school teachers and principals\r\n\r\nin addition to those in the JCs.  They will then be in  a\r\n\r\nbetter  position  to offer advice to their  students  and\r\n\r\nparents.   This way, I believe that it will help smoothen\r\n\r\nthe implementation of the new curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to suggest to the Ministry to\r\n\r\nconsider  including some elementary management components\r\n\r\nin  the  new  curriculum.   This  could  comprise  people\r\n\r\nmanagement  skills, communication skills, decision-making\r\n\r\nprocess, basic business and management principles.   This\r\n\r\nis  in  line  with  our  move to  promote  and  encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.  In fact, no matter what  our  students\r\n\r\nend up doing in future, they will invariably benefit from\r\n\r\nsome basic management know-how.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some project work in the new curriculum could also\r\n\r\ninclude  development  of business  ideas  and  this  will\r\n\r\nfoster  innovative  thinking among our  students.   There\r\n\r\ncould  even  be  vacation attachment programmes  to  give\r\n\r\nstudents  an  opportunity to see first-hand how  business\r\n\r\ncorporations  work and the issues involved in  running  a\r\n\r\nbusiness.    Schools   who  wish  to   offer   management\r\n\r\ncomponents may be able to draw on the resources from  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  schools  in  the  universities  or  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate   sector.   This  way,  we  can  inject   greater\r\n\r\nprofessionalism in our courses.  Hopefully, over time, we\r\n\r\ncan  produce more entrepreneurs to spearhead our economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the proposed integrated programmes, it\r\n\r\nis  important  for  us to carefully explain  the  various\r\n\r\nmodels  to the students and the parents so that they  are\r\n\r\nin a position to make informed decisions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the route they are taking, so  that  they\r\n\r\ncan reap the maximum benefits.  To provide diversity,  it\r\n\r\nis  good  to allow JCs and secondary schools to  come  up\r\n\r\nwith creative ideas on integrated programmes.  So far, we\r\n\r\nhave  seen  quite a number of schools submitting  a  wide\r\n\r\nvariety  of  proposals.  I am sure more  variations  will\r\n\r\nemerge  as time goes on. Even the university is  keen  to\r\n\r\noperate a specialised school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid confusion, it would be useful for the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  explain in layman's terms  how  the  system\r\n\r\nworks  and  how  parents and students should  make  their\r\n\r\ndecisions and the implications of their decisions.  Annex\r\n\r\nN  of  the  report provides a very good overview  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed  education landscape, but it is not easy  for  a\r\n\r\nlayman  to  fully  understand what it  means.   Once  the\r\n\r\nmodels have been finalised, it would be opportune for  us\r\n\r\nto  explain  in greater details.  We could also  simplify\r\n\r\nthe  models and pilot perhaps just one or two as a start.\r\n\r\nOnce   we  have  gained  more  experience,  we  can  then\r\n\r\nexperiment with greater variations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, on the proposed setting up of privately\r\n\r\nfunded  schools, I think it is a welcome  initiative.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to urge the Ministry to proactively encourage\r\n\r\ninternationally renowned private schools to set up  their\r\n\r\nbranch  here.   These well-run private schools  will  not\r\n\r\nonly  provide variety and choice for our students.   They\r\n\r\ncould  also  bring  in innovative teaching  methods  that\r\n\r\ncould  benefit our schools here as well.  Given that  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of such privately funded schools is going  to  be\r\n\r\nlimited  to only two or three, I would like to  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  not  to  be too restrictive on  the  conditions\r\n\r\nimposed  on them.  The key criteria should be the quality\r\n\r\nof their system and the quality of their output.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.32 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth point relates to the 3-year pre-university\r\n\r\nprogrammes which are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncurrently  provided  in  the two centralised  institutes.\r\n\r\nMost  of the proposals in the White Paper are focused  on\r\n\r\nthe   objective  of  maximising  the  potential  of   our\r\n\r\nstudents,  especially those who are in the upper  end  of\r\n\r\nthe cohort.  This invariably gives rise to the impression\r\n\r\nthat  the lower end of the cohort, especially those  that\r\n\r\nare  pursuing  the 3-year pre-university programmes,  are\r\n\r\nbeing  neglected.  There were few proposals, if  any,  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the system to also maximise their potential.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to urge the Ministry to also look  into  this\r\n\r\naspect  so  that these students would not feel left  out.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  some  of them may be suitable for  the  proposed\r\n\r\nspecialised independent schools if they possess  specific\r\n\r\ntalents.  A system could be put in place to allow them to\r\n\r\nswitch to these specialised schools where appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, communication is vital. Whatever changes we\r\n\r\nwant to make to the education policy, it is vital that we\r\n\r\ntake pains to explain them to the teachers, students  and\r\n\r\nparents.   This  is crucial in garnering  acceptance  and\r\n\r\nsupport for the policy changes and for the new policy  to\r\n\r\nbe  effective.  For this reason, I would like to urge the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  continue to engage the various stakeholders\r\n\r\nthrough public media, dialogue sessions and other avenues\r\n\r\nto  explain to them and to solicit feedback from them  as\r\n\r\nwe  refine  the  proposals.  It may  even  be  useful  to\r\n\r\nproduce an easy-to-understand booklet to explain the  new\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is a vital part of our Government policy\r\n\r\nas it affects the entire population and it determines our\r\n\r\nfuture.  It is also one of the most difficult part as its\r\n\r\neffects  are  usually  not immediately  obvious.   Madam,\r\n\r\nthere  is no perfect system, although every parent thinks\r\n\r\nand  believes  that he alone knows the perfect  solution.\r\n\r\nWe  must  continuously review and improve  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem to keep up with the times, so as to give the  best\r\n\r\nto  our  children.  I sincerely hope that this report  is\r\n\r\nnot  the end but a turning point.  I hope that the review\r\n\r\nprocess  will  continue  and our  future  generation  can\r\n\r\nbenefit from an ever improving system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nthank  you  for  allowing me to speak on today's  motion,\r\n\r\nwhich has far-reaching and long-term implications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to state that this is a\r\n\r\ncourageous  and  responsive  move  on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education.  There has been so much  talk  in\r\n\r\nhomes,  schools  and  debates in the  newspapers  on  our\r\n\r\nschool  system   -  the pressure on the school  children,\r\n\r\nthe perceived rigidity and, of course, its strengths.  As\r\n\r\nsome of the earlier speakers have said, after all is said\r\n\r\nand done, we do not have a train wreck!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback has been taken into account and many\r\n\r\nopinions  sought.  I applaud the efforts of the Committee\r\n\r\nto  tap  a  wide spectrum of views.  The fact  that  this\r\n\r\nmotion  is  tabled today is a reflection of our  system's\r\n\r\ntrue   responsiveness  and  swift  action  on   feedback,\r\n\r\nresulting in a timely and better solution for the  future\r\n\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that we have the courage to make changes\r\n\r\nto  our system when we feel there is a true need for  it.\r\n\r\nIn  many aspects, this also reflects the true strength of\r\n\r\nour people, the willingness to make changes even ahead of\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To revamp the education system is not an easy\r\n\r\nmatter.    It   will   involve  changes   in   processes,\r\n\r\nmethodology, systems and, more importantly, mindsets.  It\r\n\r\nwill  not  happen  overnight and it will be  painstaking.\r\n\r\nThe impact will be far-reaching.  Many, those already  in\r\n\r\nschool  as well as our future generations, will feel  the\r\n\r\nimpact.   So,  why are we doing all this?   In  order  to\r\n\r\nensure that our only key vital resource - our people - is\r\n\r\nnurtured  and  developed to be able  to  compete  in  the\r\n\r\nglobal  arena.   That our people are economically  active\r\n\r\nand in the passage through life enrich the well being  of\r\n\r\nboth themselves and their fellow citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While changes are being proposed to our education\r\n\r\nsystem,  this is not to say that our current system  does\r\n\r\nnot  have its benefits.  Many of us have gone through the\r\n\r\ncurrent or even the older system,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepending  on our ages.  We all have benefited  from  it.\r\n\r\nIt   has   produced   high  levels  of   achievement   by\r\n\r\ninternational    comparisons.     Our    students    have\r\n\r\nconsistently done well overseas, courted and  admired  by\r\n\r\nforeign  centres  of learning.  So, at this  juncture,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to reiterate some of these benefits  which  I\r\n\r\nhope would not be lost in the revamped system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current system produces outstanding Science and\r\n\r\nMathematics students.  Other countries have evaluated our\r\n\r\napproach   and   adopted   our   syllabi   and   teaching\r\n\r\nmethodology.  Perhaps it is the rigour of the system, the\r\n\r\ndisciplined approach that has generated this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important aspect that must be retained is\r\n\r\nthe continuous effort to integrate our people; to build a\r\n\r\nsociety  that is multi-racial, multi-cultural and  multi-religious.  My early memories of school is the recital of\r\n\r\nthe  Pledge before the start of each school day.  We must\r\n\r\npreserve this at all costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on to the proposed revised education framework\r\n\r\nand education system.  I particularly like a quote that I\r\n\r\nread  recently  which, I believe, is appropriate  in  our\r\n\r\ndiscussion today.  By theologian, T. Edwards,  who  lived\r\n\r\nin the 19th century, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The great end of education is to discipline rather\r\n\r\nthan  to furnish the mind; to train it to the use of  its\r\n\r\nown powers, rather than fill it with the accumulation  of\r\n\r\nothers.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis,  I  believe,  is the thrust of  what  our  proposed\r\n\r\nsystem aims to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have succeeded in imparting knowledge to our\r\n\r\nstudents.  They, in turn, are like sponges soaking in all\r\n\r\nthe  information  that is fed to them.  Too  often,  they\r\n\r\naccept the knowledge imparted without question.  This may\r\n\r\nstem from our traditional respect for teachers and people\r\n\r\nin authority and therefore not questioning.  As a result,\r\n\r\nwe  have  often  heard our students are  too  reliant  on\r\n\r\nteachers  to  feed them with information that  they  lack\r\n\r\nquestioning minds and initiative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of these qualities is glaringly noticed\r\n\r\nwhen they enter the workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnecdotal examples from friends and colleagues illustrate\r\n\r\nthis  point.   Let me just share one.  A  foreign  senior\r\n\r\nmanager, whom I had the chance to speak with, is  from  a\r\n\r\nmajor   disk  drive  manufacturer.   He  heads   a   team\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  Asia and draws talent from  around  the\r\n\r\nworld.   Among  his  10 senior managers   -   the  people\r\n\r\nmapping  strategies, formulating solutions and responding\r\n\r\nto   challenges   -   he  has  a  wide  range  of   Asian\r\n\r\nnationalities  but no Singaporeans.  Why?   \"Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  not  innovative enough\" was his response. They  need\r\n\r\nchecklists  and  a guiding hand all the time.   And  they\r\n\r\nplay  it  safe.   However, his middle management  is  all\r\n\r\npopulated with Singaporeans who he can trust because they\r\n\r\nare great executors of plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This and other anecdotes may be symptomatic of the\r\n\r\nissue  -  rote  learning.  To survive  well  in  an  ever\r\n\r\nchanging  and more globalised economy, we must equip  our\r\n\r\nyounger  generation to question and think on their  feet.\r\n\r\nThey will then be able to adapt to different environments\r\n\r\nand be able to face challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if one remembers that the great bulk of the body\r\n\r\nof  knowledge had been amassed in the last hundred  years\r\n\r\nand  fast accelerating, what we learn today may  well  be\r\n\r\nobsolete in our lifetime.  Hence, we need to pay heed  to\r\n\r\nhow  we impart knowledge in this very modern world; where\r\n\r\nthe  information highway makes available at the speed  of\r\n\r\nlight  a  whole cache of information through the Internet\r\n\r\nand other modern media.  There is a wealth of information\r\n\r\nand  knowledge  out  there waiting to  be  harvested  and\r\n\r\nturned into useful, commercially viable know-how.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new emphasis on project work, research and\r\n\r\ninquiry-based   search for knowledge at  an  early  stage\r\n\r\nwould develop and hone the questioning spirit and nurture\r\n\r\ninquisitive minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, self expression must be encouraged.\r\n\r\nMulti-way  communication must be buoyant.  The  classroom\r\n\r\nmust  be  turned  into a forum.  The  flow  of  thoughts,\r\n\r\nquestions and ideas should not be linear.  A matrix  flow\r\n\r\nmust be encouraged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween  students and teachers; among students and  among\r\n\r\nteachers.   Teachers  must relish the  challenge  and  be\r\n\r\ntrained  to  draw  out  the  more  reserved  among  their\r\n\r\nstudents.   The  Socratic method of  teaching  -  drawing\r\n\r\nanswers  from questions posed, getting students  involved\r\n\r\nand excited about the material being taught - is one form\r\n\r\nof doing this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversity is our strength. Hence, I also support\r\n\r\nthe  flexibility of the new system to allow for  academic\r\n\r\nand non-academic specialisations.  The approach of having\r\n\r\nsports  and arts specialities in dedicated schools  would\r\n\r\nopen  up  new avenues for our young who are endowed  with\r\n\r\nthese talents.  We have to persevere or we would not have\r\n\r\na  continuous  stream  of badminton, bowling,  ping-pong,\r\n\r\nplaywrights  and violinist stars to stand proud  for  us.\r\n\r\nWe redefine what is success for our young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the key to the success of the\r\n\r\nproposed new system rests on two points revolving  around\r\n\r\nimplementation.  One, to ensure that there is an adequate\r\n\r\npool  of  teachers  who can switch from  the  traditional\r\n\r\napproach  to teaching.  No longer must there be just  one\r\n\r\nway  or  a  fixed  way to approach a problem.   Students'\r\n\r\ncuriosity  must be aroused, and they must  be  guided  to\r\n\r\nfigure  out  complex issues with their own  thinking  and\r\n\r\ninsights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouragement must abound. Remove the fear of\r\n\r\nfailure,  of giving wrong answers.  At all ages, students\r\n\r\nmust be encouraged to experiment, to fail, understand why\r\n\r\nthey  failed, nudged to pick up and try again.   Teachers\r\n\r\nmust establish that rapport with the students, create  an\r\n\r\nintellectually uninhibited environment in the  classroom;\r\n\r\nunfreeze  the students psychologically from the paralysis\r\n\r\nthat stems from the fear of \"messing up\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point on implementation is priority and\r\n\r\npace.   I  believe the approach is correct.  We must  not\r\n\r\nfail  because we do not apply the adequate level and type\r\n\r\nof resources in the execution.  Hence, while\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe changes proposed are bold, we may have to prioritise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal of creating even greater diversity in\r\n\r\ncourses  and new pathways is, in my opinion, not an  area\r\n\r\nof  immediate  urgency.   We  must  allow  time  for  the\r\n\r\nstudents  to reorientate to these new educational  skills\r\n\r\nand  priorities.  Introducing too many changes all at the\r\n\r\nsame time may, in fact, cause saturation, heavy workload,\r\n\r\nand  may  result  in  disruption and confusion  for  both\r\n\r\nstudents  and  teachers.  A phased  approach  will  be  a\r\n\r\nbetter way to introduce such evolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal is comprehensive in many aspects.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I hope the Committee would consider three  more\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is a system that is unforgiving; one\r\n\r\nthat  does  not allow repeated failures.  The flexibility\r\n\r\nand  diversity of the new proposal involve some  form  of\r\n\r\nrisk  taking  by  the  students  too.   They  are  making\r\n\r\ndecisions  at  a tender age and we must be prepared  that\r\n\r\nsome  make mistakes in judgement.  Here is the only  area\r\n\r\nwhere  I think the proposal has not gone far enough.   We\r\n\r\nmust  have a structure in which they are given  a  second\r\n\r\nchance;  and even maybe a third.  For if we subscribe  to\r\n\r\nlife-long learning, then we must allow students to unwind\r\n\r\nearlier  choices  and start anew.  Like what  the  Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary said,  \"as  long  as  the  train\r\n\r\narrives, it does not matter if it is late.\"  So along the\r\n\r\nway,  maybe we may create the entrepreneurial environment\r\n\r\nthat we all yearn for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is that the new proposal should\r\n\r\nincrease  emphasis on National Education.  This has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  schools  and  it  must  continue  to   be\r\n\r\nemphasised.   I  have  heard from a  fellow  MP  that  he\r\n\r\ndetects  that  younger people in the upper secondary  and\r\n\r\npost-secondary  exhibit  less  of  an  identification  to\r\n\r\nSingapore than those in their mid-twenties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this so? Should not this sense of identity\r\n\r\nset in earlier rather than later?  Hence, I hope that the\r\n\r\nCommittee  will  look  into  more  aspects  of   National\r\n\r\nEducation.  Beyond textbooks, bring National Education to\r\n\r\nlife, eg, visits to military\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncamps,  exposure to our war heroes, our journey to  water\r\n\r\nsufficiency, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a young nation; our people are always looking\r\n\r\nahead  and  perhaps spending too little time  remembering\r\n\r\nthe  past.   We must do more to commemorate and celebrate\r\n\r\nthe sacrifices of those that had made nationhood possible\r\n\r\nfor  us.   The achievements, sacrifices and contributions\r\n\r\nof  the  many notable Singaporeans must be made known  to\r\n\r\nthe young.  Hence, why not make National Education one of\r\n\r\nthe  KI or PW topics?  Rather than suffer the fate  that,\r\n\r\nif  imposed  upon, some youngsters feel  they  are  being\r\n\r\nbrain-washed; let them go on a journey of self-discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point concerns stress and pressure. This\r\n\r\ncomes  up  often  whenever the subject  of  education  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  discussed.  Could the  Committee  consider\r\n\r\nmore  emphasis  on continual assessment  and  reduce  the\r\n\r\nfrequency  of  examinations?  With  less  rote  learning,\r\n\r\nthere   should  be  a  correspondingly  less   need   for\r\n\r\nexaminations that we know today.  Learning should be fun.\r\n\r\nThe  KI approach could be extended to even more subjects.\r\n\r\nExamination   pressure  may  actually  paradoxically   be\r\n\r\nmitigated by incessant and continuous assessments.   And,\r\n\r\nthrough life, we are continually assessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond my earlier suggestions on some adjustments to\r\n\r\nthe  proposals, I am totally supportive.  Especially,  in\r\n\r\nthe  new school environment, emphasis must be on students\r\n\r\npresenting  and convincing other students.  Communication\r\n\r\nskills  must be brought to the forefront.  From a  tender\r\n\r\nage,  they  must  learn  to stand up,  speak,  be  heard,\r\n\r\nconvince and defend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just returned from a short trip to Israel and\r\n\r\none  thing  I  heard is that when you  put  two  Israelis\r\n\r\ntogether you will get three opinions.  Why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we hope to turn out generations of more inquiring\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, we may also have to handle the  possibility\r\n\r\nof a more chaotic, challenging, vibrant and unpredictable\r\n\r\nenvironment.   But  this is exactly  the  strength  of  a\r\n\r\npluralistic society, tapping the wisdom and experience of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neveryone.   We  just  have to be prepared  for  this  new\r\n\r\nenvironment,  stay  the  course  and  not  waver  in  our\r\n\r\nresolve,  for  it could get uncomfortable for  the  older\r\n\r\npeople used to more compliance.  It is a journey that  we\r\n\r\nmust see through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I reiterate that I am in favour of\r\n\r\nthe  proposal  to revise the education  system.   In  the\r\n\r\nprocess,  we  must  bear in mind not  to  put  additional\r\n\r\npressure  on  our students.  Hence the recommendation  to\r\n\r\ntrim  curriculum content to create space for enhancements\r\n\r\nto  other areas in JC education is applaudable.   Parents\r\n\r\nhave  consistently been complaining that  their  children\r\n\r\nare  stressed and do not have time for recreation and  to\r\n\r\npursue other interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While aiming for a more flexible curriculum and to\r\n\r\ndevelop thinking generations of Singaporeans, the  stress\r\n\r\nfactor  must  not  be increased.  The new  system  should\r\n\r\nallow  for  students to learn at their pace, provide  for\r\n\r\nthose who may be late developers and for those with  non-academic  talents.  And they should be  given  additional\r\n\r\nchances as they explore; to fail and try again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want multi-faceted Singaporeans who will\r\n\r\ncontribute to the economy and add vibrancy to  our  young\r\n\r\nnation.   We  want  thinkers,  creators,  sportsmen   and\r\n\r\nartists.   Is  it a tall order?  Perhaps, but  we  are  a\r\n\r\nnation  known not to wallow in discussion,  one  that  is\r\n\r\nquick on our feet.  We act on solving our issues and that\r\n\r\nis what we are doing right now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being examination savvy is no longer enough. Our\r\n\r\nyoung  must  be  equipped with the best  hi-tech  fishing\r\n\r\nrods,  nets  and spear-guns to go fishing and not  merely\r\n\r\nprovided with fishes.  They must have the ability  to  do\r\n\r\nlateral and vertical thinking, to think and question  the\r\n\r\nfundamentals, to achieve understanding rather  than  just\r\n\r\nknowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mdm\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, first of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall,  I  would like to thank you for this opportunity  to\r\n\r\njoin  in  the debate on this motion.  There are 27  other\r\n\r\ncolleagues  who would like to speak on the motion  and  I\r\n\r\nwill try my best to make my speech short and brief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, in this new economy era, in\r\n\r\norder  to   survive,  our people must  be  able  to  make\r\n\r\nchanges,  be flexible and adjust ourselves   to  keep  up\r\n\r\nwith  the times. As such, this proposal to reform our  JC\r\n\r\neducation is very apt and appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report of the Junior College/Upper Secondary\r\n\r\nEducation Review Committee has been carefully deliberated\r\n\r\nupon  and  presented  by a panel of  experts.  All  these\r\n\r\nrecommendations  are  based on very  solid  grounds.  The\r\n\r\npurpose  of the reform is to broaden the scope of studies\r\n\r\nof  our  students and to give them more space to  develop\r\n\r\ntheir  potentials and talents to the fullest.   They  are\r\n\r\nvery creative and challenging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discussed with many parents and teachers on\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  of the Review  Committee,  and  the\r\n\r\nfeedback I have is mainly positive. Here, I would like to\r\n\r\nmake three points concerning the proposed reform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the \"through-train\" method. The Committee\r\n\r\nis  recommending  that  some students,  particularly  the\r\n\r\nbetter students, be allowed to go straight from Secondary\r\n\r\nOne to the \"A\" level without having to take the \"O\" level\r\n\r\nexamination,  and  from  there proceed  straight  to  the\r\n\r\nuniversity.   This  is a break-through  and  a  watershed\r\n\r\ndecision in the reform of our education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this aspect, I would like to ask what criteria\r\n\r\nwill MOE take to decide who will be exempted from the \"O\"\r\n\r\nlevel examinations and take the through-train to the  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevel examinations. Will MOE simply designate a number of\r\n\r\nschools  to be the \"through-trains\", and all the students\r\n\r\non  board will go straight to the \"A\" level examinations?\r\n\r\nIn  my  opinion, this method will lead to some  problems,\r\n\r\nbecause in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  way, would not all the students who score  well  in\r\n\r\nthe  PSLE  be concentrated in these \"elite\" schools,  and\r\n\r\nall  the  other students who could not make the grade  to\r\n\r\nthese  elite  schools would be deemed to be  second-class\r\n\r\nstudents, and their schools become second-class  schools?\r\n\r\nThe  teachers in these schools will then feel  that  they\r\n\r\nare  given the second-class students to teach. They  will\r\n\r\nnaturally  be  demoralised, and  the  standard  of  their\r\n\r\nteaching,  and consequently the standard of  the  schools\r\n\r\nwould be lowered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When MOE decides on the \"through-train\" system,\r\n\r\nwould  it  be  compulsory for all the  students  in  this\r\n\r\nsystem  to  skip  the  \"O'\" level examinations?   Do  the\r\n\r\nstudents  have  a choice?  As a matter of fact,  students\r\n\r\nwho  are  good  in  their  studies  are  not  afraid   of\r\n\r\nexaminations,  because the examinations  can  only  prove\r\n\r\nthat  they  are strong in their studies.  So,  would  the\r\n\r\nstudents  be  given  an  option to  take  the  \"O\"  level\r\n\r\nexaminations if they decide to do so?  I have  spoken  to\r\n\r\nsome parents and they are worried that this through-train\r\n\r\nsystem  may  yield unpredictable results. The new  system\r\n\r\nwill  take  some  time before the result can  be  clearly\r\n\r\nseen.  They  are  afraid  that in  the  event  that  some\r\n\r\nstudents  could not cope with the new model of  study  in\r\n\r\nthe  reformed JC curricula, and could not do well in  the\r\n\r\n\"A\"  level  examinations, they would have  no  \"O\"  level\r\n\r\nresults to back them up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no good \"A\" level certificate in their bags,\r\n\r\nthey  would  have  nothing but a PSLE  certificate.  They\r\n\r\ncannot  qualify  for  admission to the  university.  Even\r\n\r\nlooking  for  a  job  would be a big  problem.   Can  MOE\r\n\r\nconsider  granting some sort of \"Certificate of Standard\"\r\n\r\nfor  these  students so that they would have at  least  a\r\n\r\ncertificate  to show that they have progressed  over  the\r\n\r\nyears in this \"through-train\", and has been exempted from\r\n\r\nthe  \"O\" level examinations?  This may help them to  seek\r\n\r\nadmission  in the foreign universities or to show  it  to\r\n\r\ntheir prospective employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to talk about the teaching\r\n\r\nresource.  Under this new system, we need to be  able  to\r\n\r\naccurately\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassess  the  potential of the students, and to  customise\r\n\r\nthe  teaching  accordingly, so that  the  students  would\r\n\r\nderive the optimal benefits from the system.  I think the\r\n\r\nteachers  will play a very important part.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto   know  whether  we  have  enough  teachers  who   are\r\n\r\nadequately    equipped   to   take   on    this    higher\r\n\r\nresponsibility.    Let  me  give  you  an   illustration.\r\n\r\nTeaching  is like cooking.  If you have some high-quality\r\n\r\nabalone, but you do not have a good chef to cook it,  you\r\n\r\nwould  not be able to serve out a delicious abalone dish.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, if you have the best abalone, and the\r\n\r\nbest  chef  from the famous abalone restaurant from  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  to  cook it, then I am sure you will  have  a  very\r\n\r\ndelicious  and well presented abalone dish which  is  fit\r\n\r\nfor the king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE will only start this new system in 2006. We\r\n\r\nhave  a window of  some three to four years before  that.\r\n\r\nCan  MOE make use of this period of time to identify some\r\n\r\ngood  teachers, send them overseas for special  training,\r\n\r\nso  that  they will be able to cope with the  demands  of\r\n\r\nthis  new curriculum, and the students would benefit from\r\n\r\ntheir teaching?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, during my visit to the world-renowned\r\n\r\nQinghua  University in Beijing, I was invited to  tour  a\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  primary school of the university.    While  I\r\n\r\nwas  there, the teacher was teaching these young students\r\n\r\nabout yi sheng (physician).  I observe that many articles\r\n\r\nrelating  to the medical profession, such as stethoscope,\r\n\r\nclinical  thermometer, syringes, etc, were  exhibited  in\r\n\r\nthe classroom. The teacher made use of this apparatus  to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  how  a  physician went about  examining  his\r\n\r\npatient  and diagnosing his ailments.  The students  were\r\n\r\ninvited  to ask questions, and many questions were  asked\r\n\r\nby the young children. It was indeed a highly interactive\r\n\r\nsession.    The students were also invited to participate\r\n\r\nin   role-plays  whereby  some  took  the  part  of   the\r\n\r\nphysicians  and  the  others  played  the  part  of   the\r\n\r\npatients.  The  whole  lesson was  conducted  in  a  very\r\n\r\nrelaxed  and informal manner. No pressure, no  stress.  I\r\n\r\ncould   see   that   the   students  thoroughly   enjoyed\r\n\r\nthemselves,  and I am sure they must have  learnt  a  lot\r\n\r\nfrom this kind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof exercise. This is what I call creative teaching!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, I had dinner with the Principal of a\r\n\r\nJunior  College and he was telling me that  the  teaching\r\n\r\nmethod in Singapore was also very creative.  Perhaps,  we\r\n\r\nhave left school for too long a period.  In the last  few\r\n\r\ndecades,  we can clearly see that the school premises and\r\n\r\nfacilities, or the hardware aspect, have improved a  lot.\r\n\r\nBut,  we  really do not know about the software aspect  - the  teaching methods, contents and style.  A few  months\r\n\r\nago, I had the opportunity to visit the ITE, and it was a\r\n\r\nreal eye-opener for me.  I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether some arrangements can be made for our MPs and our\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders to visit the junior colleges  and  the\r\n\r\nschools,  to  see  for  ourselves whether  this  software\r\n\r\naspect  of  our  education system could  match  the  vast\r\n\r\nimprovement in the hardware aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often hear in this House that schools in the\r\n\r\nother  countries  are  better. For  what  you  know,  our\r\n\r\nschools  may well be better than theirs.  If our MPs  can\r\n\r\nhave  the opportunity to visit the junior colleges,  they\r\n\r\nwill have a better understanding of these colleges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, under the new system, how will MOE evaluate\r\n\r\nthe  performance of the junior colleges?  If we  want  to\r\n\r\nattain  good results, the teachers must have the  support\r\n\r\nof  the  principals for them to apply their  talents  and\r\n\r\ncreativity in their teaching.  But, if MOE still  insists\r\n\r\non  using   examination results as the basis to  evaluate\r\n\r\nand  rank the junior colleges, then this new system  will\r\n\r\nturn  out  to be just an ideal, and will not be practical\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should evaluate the teachers on their creativity,\r\n\r\nnot just on the examination results.  In a restaurant, if\r\n\r\nthe  owner restricts the chef to just a few dishes in the\r\n\r\nmenu, no matter how creative the chef may be, he will not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to dish out more delicious cuisines to  attract\r\n\r\nmore  customers.  I hope that MOE would  also  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the creativity of the teachers  when  they\r\n\r\nrank the junior colleges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should use the 6/2/2 system, that means 60% based\r\n\r\non   the   results  attained  by  the  students  in   the\r\n\r\nexaminations and 20% based on the teaching method of  the\r\n\r\nteachers.   We should send out inspectors to  schools  to\r\n\r\nevaluate  the  creative level of the  teachers.   If  the\r\n\r\nteachers  are  very creative, we should  give  them  more\r\n\r\npoints, more incentives.  So this will make up 20% of the\r\n\r\ntotal   evaluation.  The remaining 20% will be  based  on\r\n\r\nthe   creativity  of  the  students.    We   are   always\r\n\r\nencouraging the students to be creative, to make full use\r\n\r\nof  their talents. The performance of the students can be\r\n\r\nreflected  by their linguistic capability, the  way  they\r\n\r\nexpress  themselves  and the way  they  communicate  with\r\n\r\nothers.   Merits   should  also  be  awarded   to   their\r\n\r\nparticipation  and contributions in the  field  of  arts,\r\n\r\nsports   and  community  service.   I  think  we   should\r\n\r\nencourage our students to give full play to their talents\r\n\r\nand their potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my sincere hope that MOE would move away from\r\n\r\nthe  existing system whereby the ranking of  schools  and\r\n\r\ncolleges  is  weighted  heavily on  examination  results.\r\n\r\nMore  emphasis  should  be placed on  the  creativity  or\r\n\r\ninnovations of the teachers and the students. I think  in\r\n\r\nthis way, the principals, teachers, students and even the\r\n\r\nparents  will put in concerted efforts and work  hand-in-hand to raise the overall standard of the schools, to the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that MOE would consider the three suggestions\r\n\r\nI  have  made. Finally, I would like to thank Mdm  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker for giving me this opportunity to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.12 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  some  13 years ago, when I first  entered  this\r\n\r\nreputable Chamber, I commented that our education  system\r\n\r\nproduced  many students who were \"exam-smart\",  extremely\r\n\r\ncapable of only scoring very many As.  I questioned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  whether this was what our nation wanted to achieve.\r\n\r\nNow, 13 years on, I am very glad to note that at last the\r\n\r\nproblem is being addressed in a substantial way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with many points made in the White Paper.\r\n\r\nWhile  our  system has been efficient in  mass  producing\r\n\r\ntrained  and  skilled  workers for  our  early  years  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, it is no longer good enough to take us\r\n\r\ninto  the next 30 years in this information era.  In this\r\n\r\nnew  age, we must be capable of not only producing  goods\r\n\r\nand  services,  but also new knowledge  and  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty.    Unlike  the  traditional  industrial   goods\r\n\r\nproducing economy, the new winners of the information age\r\n\r\nare  companies  which  own significant  IPR  like  CISCO,\r\n\r\nMicrosoft and Pfizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are our top students creative enough and\r\n\r\nenterprising  enough to fit into this  new  era  to  take\r\n\r\nSingapore into the brave new world?  We must address this\r\n\r\nproblem  now.   Otherwise, like many other countries,  we\r\n\r\nmay  get caught in the sandwich class: trapped in between\r\n\r\nthe  newly industrialising, low cost countries like China\r\n\r\nand  India, and the western countries who own and produce\r\n\r\nmost of the world's IPR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the problems we have to address in our\r\n\r\neducation  system?  Please let me comment on some  points\r\n\r\nfrom  the Report.  Firstly, many of our schools  and  JCs\r\n\r\nadhere   strictly  to  the  syllabus  published  by   the\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministry.  This leads to a homogenous  student\r\n\r\npopulation  with  little variation - hence  the  lack  of\r\n\r\ndiversity.  But, parents are also to blame.  If you are a\r\n\r\nbright  student scoring many As, try telling your parents\r\n\r\nthat  you  want  to  go into drama school  to  do  acting\r\n\r\ninstead of taking up the place offered to you by RJC!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is an over-emphasis on knowledge per\r\n\r\nse.  Classes become information download sessions.  Often\r\n\r\nneglected   are  the  skills  associated  with  learning,\r\n\r\nthinking  and  research.  This leads to poor  ability  to\r\n\r\ncritique, rigidity, poor reasoning skills, low creativity\r\n\r\nand  a spoon-feeding attitude, in which the students (and\r\n\r\nlater our workers) invariably\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nawait   instructions  and  information  from  the  higher\r\n\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, these problems are compounded by \"short-termerism\", ie, study only for the examinations! Try\r\n\r\nasking a student something about what he has studied  two\r\n\r\nmonths  after his final 'A' level paper.  Or  try  asking\r\n\r\nhim  to read up on something which is interesting but  is\r\n\r\nnot  in the syllabus.  This problem arises from the  fact\r\n\r\nthat   our   examinations  are  very  poorly  structured.\r\n\r\nQuestions   can  be  \"spotted\".   Answers  are  memorised\r\n\r\nwholesale,  sometimes without real understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nsubject  matter.  Indeed, even students from our top  JCs\r\n\r\nmemorise  GP,  essays or economic analysis,  hoping  that\r\n\r\ntheir  \"spotted\"  topics will \"come  out\"  in  the  final\r\n\r\nexaminations!   Is this what we want from  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I must commend CHIJ Katong for being\r\n\r\nbrave enough to make Literature compulsory for their  'O'\r\n\r\nlevel  students.  Literature is sometimes a much  dreaded\r\n\r\nsubject.  It is difficult to score an A1.  There  are  no\r\n\r\ngood  \"standard\"  solutions - no model answers  are  ever\r\n\r\ngood enough, no DS solution, as we say, in the Army.  And\r\n\r\neverything can be argued from different points  of  view.\r\n\r\nFurther,  it  is  also very difficult to  teach  properly\r\n\r\nbecause  a  teacher has to be good enough  and  confident\r\n\r\nenough to accommodate many different points of views from\r\n\r\nthe students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHIJ Katong believes that the study of Literature\r\n\r\nteaches  their students life-long skills that will  serve\r\n\r\nthem  well  during their lifetime and it is not  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of scoring A1s during examinations.  If the  A1s\r\n\r\ndo not materialise, so be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are the skill sets which we should try to\r\n\r\nimpart  on  to our students?  There are four basic  skill\r\n\r\nsets  which  our students should learn by the  time  they\r\n\r\nleave  the  JCs.  They are (1) ability to think,  reason,\r\n\r\nself-learn,   research  for  facts,   probe   by   asking\r\n\r\nintelligent   questions  and  critique.    Without   this\r\n\r\ncapability, whatever our students learn in their JCs will\r\n\r\nsoon  become  outdated, if it has not  faded  from  their\r\n\r\nvolatile memory before that.  They will certainly not  be\r\n\r\nable to produce new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknowledge nor lead in any R&D activity.  Hence,  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest that As and distinctions should not be given  for\r\n\r\nvarious subjects until a student has clearly demonstrated\r\n\r\nhis thinking and reasoning capability.  It is too easy to\r\n\r\nget  an  \"A\"  if  all it requires is the reproduction  of\r\n\r\nlecture and tutorial notes given by the teachers as model\r\n\r\nanswers.  Even a dumb photocopying machine can do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Communications, ie, writing, presentation and\r\n\r\nrecording.  As pointed out by the Review Committee,  this\r\n\r\nis  a  major  area of weakness for many of our  students.\r\n\r\nInventions  and  discoveries can  be  useless  if  nobody\r\n\r\nunderstands  your  achievement.  The best  business  plan\r\n\r\nwill  fail  from  day  one if you  cannot  convince  your\r\n\r\ninvestor  or  your potential customers of the superiority\r\n\r\nof   your  product.   Apart  from  the  formal  classroom\r\n\r\nenvironment,   more  student  activities  like   debates,\r\n\r\nseminars  (where the presenters are students themselves),\r\n\r\noratorical  competition and student workshops  should  be\r\n\r\norganised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important skill which is somewhat lacking is\r\n\r\nthe  ability  to keep proper (by proper, I mean  detailed\r\n\r\nand precise) records of scientific work.  This stems from\r\n\r\nthe  over-emphasis  of  getting  the  job,  such  as   an\r\n\r\nexperiment,  done  rather than paying  attention  to  the\r\n\r\nproper  procedures and recording of the  conduct  of  the\r\n\r\nexperiment.   Teachers must be also made to realise  that\r\n\r\nlaboratory sessions are not only for teaching the  basics\r\n\r\nof  the  subject matter.  They are also to teach students\r\n\r\nhow to conduct and record an investigative procedure in a\r\n\r\nproper  manner.   This  is  an important  aspect  as  R&D\r\n\r\nactivities,   especially  in  the  biotech  field,   will\r\n\r\nnecessitate such skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Teamwork. This has already been addressed in\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper.   However, I would like  to  add  that\r\n\r\nstudents should not be participating in CCA because it is\r\n\r\ncompulsory, or merely for the CCA points which  can  help\r\n\r\nin  university  admission.  There is  much  that  can  be\r\n\r\nlearnt  from  being a committee member of  a  society  or\r\n\r\nrepresenting  your  school  in  swimming.   Participation\r\n\r\nshould come from interest and enjoyment, not CCA points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Decision making. This point may not have been\r\n\r\naddressed  in  detail  in  the Report.   However,  it  is\r\n\r\nrelated,  yet different, from the first point on thinking\r\n\r\nskills.   Decision making goes beyond ability  to  think,\r\n\r\nreason  and fact finding.  It involves a certain  measure\r\n\r\nof  courage, confidence and leadership.  Some will  argue\r\n\r\nthat  this  cannot  be  formally taught.   However,  like\r\n\r\nteamwork  skills,  we can create the correct  environment\r\n\r\nfor students to acquire this ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go through a few other interesting points.\r\n\r\nThe  Report  suggests  \"A Broader and  More  Flexible  JC\r\n\r\nCurriculum\".   I  support increasing the breadth  in  our\r\n\r\neducation  system.  However, this should be done  through\r\n\r\n\"moral  suasion\"  and  education rather  than  by  strict\r\n\r\nrules.   Imposing breadth upon the student's choices  may\r\n\r\nlead  to mechanistic rote learning in order to achieve  a\r\n\r\ngood  result in a subject, taken not because the  student\r\n\r\nloves  it,  but  taken  in order to fulfil  a  government\r\n\r\nrequirement.   Is  this education?  The very  thought  of\r\n\r\nimposing such a requirement runs directly counter to  the\r\n\r\nmain  idea  of  flexibility.  (In a way,  diversity  also\r\n\r\nsuffers  because you are eliminating the  possibility  of\r\n\r\ngenerating  some  students who  would  do  well  in  pure\r\n\r\nScience or pure Arts.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Education Ministry to\r\n\r\nconsider very carefully how we produce breadth in our  JC\r\n\r\nstudent's  education.   Ideally, it  should  be  done  by\r\n\r\nconvincing  the majority of the students that  this  will\r\n\r\nserve  them well.  It will suffice that a large  majority\r\n\r\nof  the  students, say, 80% accept this.  If the Ministry\r\n\r\nstill decides to impose it as a rule, we should still try\r\n\r\nto  convince the students and their parents of the merits\r\n\r\nof  such  a rule.  In addition to this, I would urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   to  consider  allowing  an  all-Science   (and\r\n\r\nMathematics) or an all-Arts option for exceptional cases.\r\n\r\nIn  such  cases, students may be asked to show that  they\r\n\r\nare  highly  committed  to this very  specialised  track.\r\n\r\nThis  commitment could be shown through, say, doing  some\r\n\r\nof the subjects at the H3 level or special project work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving students more flexible options is a good\r\n\r\nthing.   However,  many students are  not  well  informed\r\n\r\nenough  to  appreciate these options.  Their interest  in\r\n\r\nthe  various  subjects has not been fully  developed  and\r\n\r\ncultivated.  Many make choices due to peer group pressure\r\n\r\nand by what they hear from the media and their friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools should provide better advice and counsel to\r\n\r\nstudents making such choices.  This should be done  on  a\r\n\r\ncontinuous  basis  through career talks,  visits,  career\r\n\r\nguidance, and other such activities.  This process  is  a\r\n\r\nlong-term  one,  and  should not be  done  over  a  short\r\n\r\nperiod,  just before such choices are made.  It  is  such\r\n\r\ninterest,  developed and cultivated over the years,  that\r\n\r\nbecomes  a  passion.  Such passion is a seed of  possible\r\n\r\ngreater things in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JCs should be asked to allow more subject\r\n\r\ncombinations.  Ideally, students should be given  freedom\r\n\r\nto  choose their own subject combinations.  This will  in\r\n\r\nturn   produce  diversity  through  the  diverse  subject\r\n\r\ncombinations.   Although there may be  an  administrative\r\n\r\nand resource problem, we should allow, whenever possible,\r\n\r\nstudents  to study subjects that they love.  I understand\r\n\r\nfrom  feedback  that it is not possible to  do  \"strange\"\r\n\r\ncombinations  like Literature and Biology.   Should  this\r\n\r\nnot be allowed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that giving absolute freedom of choice\r\n\r\nmay   also   have  its  undesirable  effects.    In   our\r\n\r\nachievement-oriented  society,  many  will  go  for   the\r\n\r\ncombinations that will maximise their chances of  getting\r\n\r\nthe  most  As, rather than taking subjects that  interest\r\n\r\nthem.  This brings me to the topic of examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have touched on the weakness of our examinations\r\n\r\nearlier.   I  would like to discuss this in  more  detail\r\n\r\nhere.   While the main examination paper can continue  to\r\n\r\ntest   for  knowledge  and  standard  applications,  some\r\n\r\nquestions that test the students' understanding,  ability\r\n\r\nto  think and reason, and the ability to draw conclusions\r\n\r\nin  non-standard situations should be included.  This  is\r\n\r\nto encourage developing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknowledge   skills,  in  addition  to  merely   absorbing\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that certain subjects also produce a\r\n\r\ndisproportionate number of As.  The Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nmay  want  to check this out.  Surely, it is possible  to\r\n\r\nequalise this by adjusting the difficulty of level of the\r\n\r\nexamination questions, and by some moderation.  We  ought\r\n\r\nto  try  to  remove any incentive for choosing a  certain\r\n\r\nsubject  due  to  the  ease  of  getting  an  A  in   the\r\n\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another cause of passive students that we have today\r\n\r\nis  due  to our teaching methods.  I think there  is  too\r\n\r\nmuch  spoon-feeding in our schools and  JCs  at  present.\r\n\r\nWhile  this  may be a very efficient way to scoring  high\r\n\r\nmarks in the examinations, it is like a drug.  It deadens\r\n\r\nthe  mind  and the processes of thought, and the  student\r\n\r\nwill be nearly all lost once this is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we should continue to provide lecture notes,\r\n\r\nbut  students  should be made to refer to some  text  and\r\n\r\nreference  books.  I know of JC students who relied  only\r\n\r\non  lecture notes and never read a book for their Physics\r\n\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students should be made to look for facts and\r\n\r\ndetails by themselves.  They should also be taught how to\r\n\r\ncollate,  process and present these facts.  There  should\r\n\r\nbe  more  student  interactions  and  discussions  during\r\n\r\ntutorial classes in JCs.  The teacher could merely  chair\r\n\r\nthe discussions instead of doing most of the talking.   I\r\n\r\nstrongly  recommend  more  activities  like  peer   group\r\n\r\nteaching,   student   seminars,   debates,   forums   and\r\n\r\nworkshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the subject of\r\n\r\nuniversity entrance requirements.  I find that the  local\r\n\r\nuniversities  are  rather  rigid  in  their  methods   of\r\n\r\nselecting  students for entry, and for most  departments.\r\n\r\nGenerally,  points  are assigned for  various  \"A\"  level\r\n\r\ngrades,  and  these are summed.  If you meet the  cut-off\r\n\r\nmark,  you are in.  Otherwise, you are out.  I find  this\r\n\r\nmuch  too clinical.  How many points would you give  Remy\r\n\r\nOng for his three Asian Games Gold medals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years back, I appealed on behalf of a national\r\n\r\nlevel  badminton  player for admission to  NUS  to  study\r\n\r\nengineering.  He missed the cut-off mark by  one  or  two\r\n\r\npoints.   I  appealed  several times,  right  up  to  the\r\n\r\nhighest  level at the university, because I believe  that\r\n\r\nit  is good for NUS to accept such a student.  But, alas,\r\n\r\nthe  appeal  was  rejected, citing  the  need  to  adhere\r\n\r\nstrictly to the rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, borderline applicants ought to\r\n\r\nbe  given a chance.  An interview could be conducted  for\r\n\r\nthese  cases.   Consideration must be given  for  special\r\n\r\ncircumstances   and  achievements  outside   the   normal\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   After  all, if more effort  and  time  were\r\n\r\nspent  on  his \"A\" level subject instead of his badminton\r\n\r\nactivities, much better \"A\" level results might have been\r\n\r\nobtained.  On the other hand, some other applicant may be\r\n\r\nable  to show during his interview that he is far  better\r\n\r\nin a certain subject than his \"A\" level results indicate,\r\n\r\nand  his lower mark could be due to an illness during his\r\n\r\nexamination paper.  Surely, such cases deserve a chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to comment on the use of Project\r\n\r\nWork  (PW) for university entrance requirements.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthis  will  not  add to the stress and  workload  of  our\r\n\r\nalready  over-taxed JC students.  Assessment  of  Project\r\n\r\nWork  is also rather subjective in nature, and this could\r\n\r\nlead  to  accusations of unfairness.  I suggest that  the\r\n\r\nuniversities  use a pass/fail requirement for  PW  rather\r\n\r\nthan  taking into account the actual PW grade  for  their\r\n\r\nentrance consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the White Paper's recommendation for\r\n\r\nIntegrated  Programmes,  private schools  and  specialist\r\n\r\nschools.   This  is  because  they  bring  about  greater\r\n\r\ndiversity for the system and more flexibility and  choice\r\n\r\nfor the students.  I also support keeping open the 3-year\r\n\r\npre-university centres for students who would  prefer  to\r\n\r\ntake  more  time  to do their \"A\" levels.   I  hope  that\r\n\r\ntransfers  between these different types of schools  will\r\n\r\nbe   possible,   so  that  students  will   have   better\r\n\r\nflexibility to pursue their intended goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to mention that more resources\r\n\r\nwill be needed to truly achieve the goals of this reform.\r\n\r\nTeachers   themselves  need  to  be   retrained.    Their\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  the subject may need to be far  wider  and\r\n\r\ndeeper  than  just the syllabus, because the  better  and\r\n\r\nmore intelligent students may bring up such issues during\r\n\r\ndiscussion  sessions.  I have no doubt  that  the  reform\r\n\r\nwill be difficult for some.  However, I think that it  is\r\n\r\nbeneficial  and  that it can be done.  I agree  with  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper's  recommendation  for  more  teachers   and\r\n\r\nteaching   resources   in  order   to   facilitate   this\r\n\r\nimprovement in our education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to caution that all will be in\r\n\r\nvain  if schools and JCs pay lip-service to these changes\r\n\r\nwithout  truly  understanding  and  accepting  the  basic\r\n\r\nphilosophy underlying the reform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the White Paper has provided the\r\n\r\nright concept and framework for reform.  It remains to be\r\n\r\nseen whether and how we can implement it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.20 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I have had the benefit\r\n\r\nof  chairing a sub-committee for Remaking Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nhave engaged many people and, from their feedback, I know\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans  take  a keen  interest  in  education\r\n\r\nissues but remain divided about the many features of  our\r\n\r\neducation system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's debate is on a motion of great import. It\r\n\r\nwill  determine, in no small part, whether  our  children\r\n\r\nwill lead fulfilling lives.  Once we set our compass  and\r\n\r\ndecide  on  the course, cohorts of Singaporeans  will  be\r\n\r\nheaded  along this course, and it will take us  years  to\r\n\r\nchange our bearings or to steer them back.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\ncommend  the  Ministry of Education  for  subjecting  its\r\n\r\nreport to robust debate here,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the Party for going a step further, to lift the Whip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to have a meaningful strategic\r\n\r\nconversation  on education until we settle the  score  on\r\n\r\nthe  merits  of  the different approaches  to  education.\r\n\r\nThere  are,  I think, two basic approaches to  education.\r\n\r\nLet  us  call  the  first approach the `syllabus-centred'\r\n\r\napproach, and the second the `learner-centred' approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and more traditional syllabus-centred\r\n\r\napproach in education defines the purpose of teaching  as\r\n\r\nensuring  that  students acquire  a  prescribed  body  of\r\n\r\nknowledge  and a set of values as determined by  society.\r\n\r\nThis  is  so that they will grow up to meet the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  future  society, namely, what  is  required  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens and what is required of our workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What follows from such an approach are didactic\r\n\r\nteachers,  top-down  teaching, well-behaved  learners,  a\r\n\r\ncarefully  designed  curriculum and  a  very  disciplined\r\n\r\nenvironment.   The  characteristics of such  a  syllabus-centred approach are sequential preparation for the  next\r\n\r\neducational  level,  tests at  the  end  of  each  stage,\r\n\r\ngrouping  learners of similar abilities  (or  streaming),\r\n\r\nand  competition among students and among schools, so  as\r\n\r\nto boost performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second approach is what we may term as the\r\n\r\nlearner-centred  approach.  Here, the starting  point  is\r\n\r\nthe  learner,  the student or the child,  rather  than  a\r\n\r\nprescribed  body  of knowledge.  The attributes  of  this\r\n\r\napproach are different.  Here, a 12-year-old is seen as a\r\n\r\n12-year-old, and is to be developed to his  or  her  full\r\n\r\npotential.   The 12-year-olds are not seen as future  13-year-olds  and  to be prepared as such.   The  curriculum\r\n\r\ntakes on an open-ended and enquiry-based orientation, and\r\n\r\nthey  are  taught experientially and through  activities,\r\n\r\nand not taught facts just to be stored.  The values to be\r\n\r\ninculcated  are  not made to conform to a  certain  mould\r\n\r\nthat   society  has  pre-determined.   Every   child   is\r\n\r\naccepted.  In fact, every child is celebrated for who  he\r\n\r\nor  she  is.   The  role of teachers here  is  merely  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  and ensure that the lid to the brain  remains\r\n\r\nopen and not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  attempt to fill it up.  Cooperation, as an underlying\r\n\r\nsocial trait, is emphasised over competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, let us consider each of these\r\n\r\napproaches and see if we can determine the right approach\r\n\r\nfor our time and place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest critic of the syllabus-centred\r\n\r\napproach can be traced back to Charles Dickens.   In  his\r\n\r\nnovel  Hard Times, he said that children subject to  such\r\n\r\nan  education system are like \"little vessels arranged in\r\n\r\norder,  ready  to have imperial gallons of  facts  poured\r\n\r\ninto  them until they are full to the brim.\" This  system\r\n\r\nrequires  precise  recall of the  lessons  learnt,  great\r\n\r\nreliance   on  memorisation  -  often  without   actively\r\n\r\nengaging  the  student  in  the  learning  process.   The\r\n\r\nassumption  that  knowledge  is  static,  something  that\r\n\r\nalready  exists, runs counter to the bewildering pace  at\r\n\r\nwhich knowledge is constantly being reshaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are also proponents of the syllabus-based system, and they have also argued, equally\r\n\r\npassionately, about the merits of such an approach.  They\r\n\r\nassert that the results of a syllabus-based approach  are\r\n\r\nmore  quantifiable,  so  that  weaker  students  may   be\r\n\r\nidentified  for remedial lessons and weaker  schools  put\r\n\r\nright.   Students are introduced to competition early  in\r\n\r\nlife.  They learn to face adversity squarely and to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  failures and labels.  They develop a practical view\r\n\r\nof  the world and are not lulled into believing that  our\r\n\r\nworld  begins with `Once upon a time .' and ends with  `.\r\n\r\nlive happily ever after'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider now the alternative learner-centred\r\n\r\napproach.   For all its strengths and its  appeal  as  an\r\n\r\navant-garde  and progressive approach, it is not  without\r\n\r\ncritics  either.   Some said it is like  allowing  growth\r\n\r\nwithout  direction and, in the extreme, as we have  heard\r\n\r\nfrom  Assoc  Prof  Koo  Tsai Kee,  it  is  like  allowing\r\n\r\nchildren to decide when, how and what they want to learn.\r\n\r\nThe  results  of  such an approach are  also  not  easily\r\n\r\nmeasured, and students or schools who are down the  wrong\r\n\r\ntrack cannot be identified early and cannot be put right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, which is a better approach? Rather, the\r\n\r\nrelevant questions are:  Do we need to settle for one  or\r\n\r\nthe  other  approach?   Do we need to  make  that  binary\r\n\r\neither/or choice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would contend that the optimal choice to prepare\r\n\r\nmost  students  lies somewhere in between  the  syllabus-centred  and  the  learner-centred approaches.   We  must\r\n\r\npreserve the rigour of our current system of education or\r\n\r\nrisk  structural failure in our schools, as again pointed\r\n\r\nout  by  Assoc Prof Koo Tsai Kee.  We must not throw  out\r\n\r\nthe baby together with the bath water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to modify Singapore's predominantly\r\n\r\nsyllabus-centred  approach to  incorporate  some  of  the\r\n\r\nfiner  features of the learner-centred approach.  Such  a\r\n\r\nhybrid  approach is one that would produce  an  education\r\n\r\nsystem  with  the  teacher still in authority,  with  the\r\n\r\nrigour  of  a challenging curriculum, yet with time  left\r\n\r\nfor  inquiry  and  active engagement of students  in  the\r\n\r\nlearning  process.  And because of the shorter shelf-life\r\n\r\nof knowledge, the subject content, the choice of subjects\r\n\r\nand,  in  fact,  the whole syllabus itself,  need  to  be\r\n\r\nreviewed more frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JC/Upper Secondary education review report does\r\n\r\nnot   discuss   the  various  approaches   to   education\r\n\r\nexplicitly,  but  implicit  in  its  recommendations   to\r\n\r\nbroaden the JC curriculum is a well-calibrated shift away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  \"syllabus-centred\" approach more  towards  the\r\n\r\n\"learner-centred\" approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of Knowledge and Inquiry as a new\r\n\r\ninter-disciplinary subject in Junior College will require\r\n\r\nstudents  to  question the bases of knowledge;  to  apply\r\n\r\nwhat  they  have  learnt,  both inside  and  outside  the\r\n\r\nclassrooms,  and  to  defend their  positions.   It  will\r\n\r\nprovide  a good counter-weight against the other content-heavy subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, rather than making Knowledge and Inquiry\r\n\r\nan  alternative  subject  to GP,  I  would  propose  that\r\n\r\nKnowledge and Inquiry be offered in lieu of GP.   In  the\r\n\r\nInternational Baccalaureate programme,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na similar \"Theory of Knowledge\" subject is compulsory for\r\n\r\nall  students and is said to be the \"glue\" of the  entire\r\n\r\ndiploma programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new emphasis on Project Work will challenge the\r\n\r\nstudents'  resourcefulness, their organisational  ability\r\n\r\nand  their presentation and communication skills and this\r\n\r\nis to be applauded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report recommends that all JC students offer at\r\n\r\nleast  a H1 contrasting subject plus GP (also at  H1)  or\r\n\r\nKnowledge  and  Inquiry at H2. On that  basis,  the  time\r\n\r\nspent  on the contrasting subject is 16% to 21%.   Whilst\r\n\r\nthe  direction  is correct, it is worthwhile  to  further\r\n\r\nincrease the time spent on contrasting subjects  once  we\r\n\r\ngain some experience with the reforms.  After all, JC  is\r\n\r\nnot a tertiary education and there is sufficient time  at\r\n\r\nuniversity  to specialise. At many liberal arts  colleges\r\n\r\nin  the  United States, every student takes a broad-based\r\n\r\ncurriculum  leading to a Bachelor of  Arts  degree.   The\r\n\r\nAmerican system sees it fit to avoid specialisation  even\r\n\r\nat   undergraduate  level.  Here  we  are  beginning   to\r\n\r\nspecialise at Junior College level although relaxing  the\r\n\r\nspecialisation  with the introduction of the  contrasting\r\n\r\nsubjects.   The  United  States  system  only  begins  to\r\n\r\nspecialise at graduate school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the Ministry's intent to update the\r\n\r\nexisting  subjects offered and to introduce new  subjects\r\n\r\nto  JC  students.   But I would like to suggest  that  we\r\n\r\nintroduce   topics   like   Management   of   Technology,\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship,  Cultural  Studies  and  Communications\r\n\r\nSkills  either as components within existing subjects  or\r\n\r\nas  new  subjects altogether.  These are  essential  life\r\n\r\nskills  if  our  young are to thrive in  an  increasingly\r\n\r\ninter-connected  world  shaped  by  rapid   technological\r\n\r\nchange.  In my 17 years of work in the private sector, no\r\n\r\none has ever asked me to solve differential equations but\r\n\r\nI  have often been expected to understand technology,  to\r\n\r\nbe  entrepreneurial,  to appreciate cultural  differences\r\n\r\nand to communicate and defend my ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, Knowledge and Inquiry, Project Work,\r\n\r\na  contrasting  subject  and  the  updating  of  existing\r\n\r\nsubjects  -  the  new JC curriculum is  refreshing  -  it\r\n\r\nretains the robustness of the \"syllabus-centred\" approach\r\n\r\n(challenging and rigorous) and adopts the finer  features\r\n\r\nof  the \"learner-centred\" approach (research, inquiry and\r\n\r\na broad curriculum).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the other major recommendation\r\n\r\nof  the report is the creation of alternative pathways in\r\n\r\nthe  upper  secondary and JC sector.  This new  diversity\r\n\r\nwill   include   an  integrated  programme,   specialised\r\n\r\nschools, alternative qualifications and private schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new routes provide choices to meet the needs\r\n\r\nof different students.  Yet, each of them is challenging,\r\n\r\nrobust   and   internationally  recognised.   Ultimately,\r\n\r\ngraduates  of  such  diverse  range  of  programmes  will\r\n\r\napproach  problems  differently and  will  come  up  with\r\n\r\nalternative solutions to a problem.  They will provide an\r\n\r\narray  of perspectives that will make for a more vibrant,\r\n\r\nresilient and successful Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Integrated Programme will do away with the GCE\r\n\r\n\"O\"  levels  for  students deemed to be university-bound.\r\n\r\nThis leaves more time for project work, CCA and character\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes.  However, it would be  better  if\r\n\r\nthe  IP  can  be  extended to more students  and  not  be\r\n\r\nconfined to the top 10% of a P1 cohort since about 22% of\r\n\r\nthe P1 cohort who took the \"A\" level examinations in 2000\r\n\r\nis  eligible  for  a local university.   If  we  consider\r\n\r\nadmissions to foreign universities, that figure  will  be\r\n\r\neven higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing schools to offer the IB and other\r\n\r\ninternationally  recognised  programmes  will  cater   to\r\n\r\nreturning students.  This is in keeping with the trend of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans working overseas at some point during  their\r\n\r\ncareers.   The  IB will also cater to those students  who\r\n\r\nprefer  a  more \"learner-centred\" approach and I  welcome\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing private schools is another change that I\r\n\r\nwelcome  but it would also be good for the Government  to\r\n\r\nencourage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  partly-fund  scholarships that are  tenable  at  such\r\n\r\nprivate  schools.  This would support those who  may  not\r\n\r\notherwise  have the financial means to enroll  into  such\r\n\r\nprivate schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like now to move on to\r\n\r\ndiscuss specialised schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to plot the distribution of our students\r\n\r\nalong the single dimension of scholastic ability, we will\r\n\r\nalways  get some form of \"bell-curve\".  There will  be  a\r\n\r\nsmall  group  of  students who are weak  academically;  a\r\n\r\nsmall  group  who are very capable and a large  group  of\r\n\r\naverage performers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the attractiveness of specialised schools is\r\n\r\nthat they will cater to students who may be deemed to  be\r\n\r\nmediocre  on  this bell curve plotted along  academic  or\r\n\r\nscholastic ability.  However, these same students may  be\r\n\r\nuniquely   capable  if  we  measure  them   along   other\r\n\r\ndimensions  like sports, arts or music.  This  broadening\r\n\r\nof  the  definition  of  success  by  MOE  is  indeed   a\r\n\r\n\"watershed\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialised schools could also afford students\r\n\r\nlonger  time  to  complete their programmes  and  also  a\r\n\r\nmodular  testing  system as opposed to  age-based,  high-stakes examinations.  This will allow such students  time\r\n\r\nto  prepare and participate in international or  national\r\n\r\nevents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that these specialised secondary schools\r\n\r\nsucceed, we need a system to identify talents at an early\r\n\r\nage.   Our  primary  school pupils  should  have  greater\r\n\r\naccess  to  qualified counsellors who will profile  their\r\n\r\nstrengths  and  weaknesses, including giftedness  in  the\r\n\r\narts, music and sports and also learning disabilities, if\r\n\r\nany.   As such counselling resources may be hard to  come\r\n\r\nby,  schools  can strike up partnerships  with  community\r\n\r\ngroups,  voluntary welfare organisations,  school  alumni\r\n\r\nand  parent  associations.  In addition, the twinning  of\r\n\r\nJC/higher    secondary   schools   with   their    junior\r\n\r\ncounterparts  -  the primary schools -  during  CCAs  and\r\n\r\nCommunity Involvement Programme - would also provide much\r\n\r\nneeded opportunities for student leadership and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharacter development.  Investing in counsellors to spot,\r\n\r\neither  talents or learning disabilities  of  pupils  and\r\n\r\nintervening  early  in  their  formative  years  will,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, yield handsome long-term returns to society as a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, for the educational reforms to\r\n\r\nsucceed, we would need more than a broad curriculum, more\r\n\r\nthan  a diverse upper secondary/JC education sector.   We\r\n\r\nwould need a complete change in the skills and styles  of\r\n\r\nlesson delivery, nothing short of some form of a cultural\r\n\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to illustrate my point with some of my own\r\n\r\nexperiences.  He summoned a student to the front  of  the\r\n\r\nclass,  blindfolded him and placed a heavy book onto  the\r\n\r\nopen  palm  of  his outstretched arm.  Then  he  abruptly\r\n\r\nremoved the book and the hand shot right up. He declared,\r\n\r\n\"For  every action  (the force of the book); there is  an\r\n\r\nequal  and  opposite reaction (the force of the  hand)  - this  is  Newton's third law of motion and our topic  for\r\n\r\ntoday's lesson\", declared Harry Tan of St Andrew's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once also attended a class at MIT where Franco\r\n\r\nModigliani  and  Lester  Thurow were  both  in  the  same\r\n\r\nclassroom   as   instructors.    Both   are   illustrious\r\n\r\neconomists   but   each   espousing   views   that    are\r\n\r\nfundamentally  opposed.  The students  must  decide  whom\r\n\r\nthey want to believe.  There were no model answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless more of our teachers are inspired to excite\r\n\r\nour students, the curriculum reforms will not bring about\r\n\r\nthe  full desired outcomes.  But our teachers have raised\r\n\r\na  valid point. They told us that they often have to rush\r\n\r\nstoically through the syllabus as their performances  are\r\n\r\nnot  measured  by  the creativity of their  delivery  but\r\n\r\nwhether   or  not  they  complete  the  tight   syllabus.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  something has to give.  We  cannot  have  the\r\n\r\ncake and eat it.  I would like to suggest that we cut the\r\n\r\nsize  of  the syllabus further so that teachers may  find\r\n\r\ntime to be creative and students will find permanence and\r\n\r\nmeaning with the knowledge that they acquire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reduction in syllabus is not aimed at reducing\r\n\r\nstress,  as  suggested by MPs like Dr Wang Kai  Yuen.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that,  by and large, our students are  resilient\r\n\r\nand  unless  we constantly challenge them, as the  Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary, Prof. Koo Tsai Kee pointed  out,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be inadequate to face the highly  competitive\r\n\r\nworld awaiting them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of a story. In fact, it is a true\r\n\r\nstory.   Jack  Welch  once received a  report  about  his\r\n\r\nexecutives  at  General Electric. Someone highlighted  to\r\n\r\nhim  that  95%  of  his  executives are  feeling  heavily\r\n\r\nstressed  and he retorted, \"What is the problem with  the\r\n\r\nother 5 percent?\" Do we want to be the GE's of the world?\r\n\r\nIf  so, then we must maintain the rigour of our education\r\n\r\nsystem.    After  all,  we  are  talking  here  about  JC\r\n\r\nstudents who are our best and brightest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenge the faculties of our students we must, but\r\n\r\nnot  by sheer quantity of the workload at the expense  of\r\n\r\nthe quality of the learning experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not deprive our students the joys to\r\n\r\nsavour the intrigue of the unfamiliar, the excitement  of\r\n\r\ndiscovery and the fulfilment of lasting knowledge. As  an\r\n\r\neducation  goal, we must encourage our youths to  develop\r\n\r\nan  inquisitive mind so that they will continue  to  seek\r\n\r\nout  whole  new  worlds  of knowledge  years  after  they\r\n\r\ncomplete their formal studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Amy Khor pointed out, for the Triple Science\r\n\r\nstudent offering four \"A\" levels, the report suggests the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  curricular time by 10% and for  humanities\r\n\r\nstudents, the curricular time remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students currently offer subjects that reflect their\r\n\r\nforte.  The  new  contrasting  subjects  will  take   our\r\n\r\nstudents  out of such forte. Hence, the time required  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a  basic foundation will be disproportionately\r\n\r\nmore  and  we  have to take cognisance  of  that.  If  we\r\n\r\ncoordinate the curriculum to be covered at JC level  with\r\n\r\nthe universities, as the report suggests,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  should  have  no problem cutting the curriculum  down\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also concerns that the reforms are not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  happen early enough in a student's educational\r\n\r\njourney. I am confident that in time, MOE will look  into\r\n\r\nintroducing  reforms  into  our  primary  and   secondary\r\n\r\nschools  as  I  am sure that such efforts  will  be  most\r\n\r\nwelcome and will yield similarly good results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me pay a tribute to all teachers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Many have laboured tirelessly  to  educate\r\n\r\nour  sons  and daughters. They will also be charged  with\r\n\r\nthe   responsibility  to  carry  out  these   educational\r\n\r\nreforms.  I wish them well and I am confident  that  they\r\n\r\nwill continue to do Singapore proud!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.42 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  would  like to express  my  appreciation  to\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  JC/Upper  Secondary  Education   Review\r\n\r\nCommittee led by SMS Tharman for their work and in coming\r\n\r\nup with some recommendations on the challenges pertaining\r\n\r\nto JC and upper secondary education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to see that a broader and more flexible\r\n\r\nJC  curriculum  to  cater for greater  diversity  in  our\r\n\r\neducation system has been recommended.  I am certain that\r\n\r\nif  these measures are successfully implemented, it would\r\n\r\nlay  the  foundation  for our children  to  compete  more\r\n\r\neffectively  in  a  globalised  economy  which   requires\r\n\r\nbreadth  of  knowledge and applications instead  of  rote\r\n\r\nlearning and specialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the proposed changes will also shift\r\n\r\nthe emphasis of education from one of content mastery  to\r\n\r\nlearning  skills  and  from  knowing  to  thinking.    In\r\n\r\nparticular, a greater emphasis towards project  work  and\r\n\r\nthe  offering  of  elective subjects like  Knowledge  and\r\n\r\nInquiry,  besides the General Paper, would  work  in  the\r\n\r\nlong-term interest of our students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the objectives and end results of the\r\n\r\nproposed  JC  education seem laudable, I  feel  that  the\r\n\r\nmeans towards these ends are just as important and should\r\n\r\nbe  adequately addressed.  Whilst the report goes a  long\r\n\r\nway  in addressing the practical needs and qualifications\r\n\r\nour  students ought to achieve and also the future  needs\r\n\r\nof  the  economy,  like many speakers  before  me,  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  that  it does not address  many  of  the  root\r\n\r\nconcerns  of our education system as it stands today.   I\r\n\r\nrefer  specifically to the \"pressure cooker\"  environment\r\n\r\nthat  has  arisen,  from the focus of  achieving  success\r\n\r\nbased mainly on academic excellence or qualifications  or\r\n\r\nindeed  what goes into the report card that our  students\r\n\r\nreceive   today.   Indeed,  as  MPs,  whenever  we   meet\r\n\r\nresidents,  be they students, parents or teachers,  their\r\n\r\ncommon  complaint  is that our education  system  is  too\r\n\r\nstressful  and  pressurising.  Our  current  emphasis  of\r\n\r\nrewards  for  students  and  teachers  based  largely  on\r\n\r\nacademic performance is partly to be blamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes will result in a broader-based\r\n\r\neducation through additional broader qualifications in H1\r\n\r\nor   H2  level  subjects.   However,  if  the  underlying\r\n\r\nstructure  of  our education system is not refocused,  we\r\n\r\nmight  just  end  up  with students  with  broader  based\r\n\r\nqualifications and scoring a lot more 'As', this time  in\r\n\r\nboth    the   Mathematics/Science   and   Arts/Humanities\r\n\r\nsubjects,  but still the same by-product of our education\r\n\r\nsystem  -  rote  learners, good  in  mastering  contents,\r\n\r\nknowledgeable   but   lack   thinking   skills,    little\r\n\r\nindependent thoughts, with less enterprise and initiative\r\n\r\nor little interest in the world around them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am concerned that this scenario could be a\r\n\r\nreal  possibility  if  we do not  change  our  system  of\r\n\r\nrewarding  our  principals and teachers.  The  Ministry's\r\n\r\ncriteria of success in ranking JCs and secondary  schools\r\n\r\nby  academic  results, and the performance evaluation  of\r\n\r\nprincipals  and  teachers  whose  career  advancement  is\r\n\r\nbased,  to  a large extent, on the deliverance  of  these\r\n\r\nresults,  are  fundamental to the pressure  cooker,  high\r\n\r\nstress, rote learning environment we have today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals and teachers have incentives to prepare\r\n\r\nmodel  answers to enable students to be examination smart\r\n\r\nand get top grades  -  at the expense of a real education\r\n\r\nper  se, since it is in the interest of their own  career\r\n\r\ndevelopment  to  do  so.  With the  continuance  of  such\r\n\r\nincentive  structures for our teachers and principals  in\r\n\r\nour education system and the ranking of JCs based largely\r\n\r\non  competitive quantitative criteria, I am doubtful that\r\n\r\nthe  high  ideals raised in this JC Report can  be  fully\r\n\r\nrealised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At worst, we might merely create additional subjects\r\n\r\nor  subject  areas including project work, CCAs  and  the\r\n\r\nlot, where students will be pressured to compete for  the\r\n\r\nsake  of  competition, and not enable them to be thinking\r\n\r\nindividuals,   capable   of  independent   learning   and\r\n\r\nenterprise.   The  end  result is a  JC  education  where\r\n\r\nstudents and teachers become more stressed out and we end\r\n\r\nup  with  the  same  products, this  time  with  students\r\n\r\nscoring  As,  not  just  in  Mathematics/Science  or  the\r\n\r\nArts/Humanities subjects, but both, and end up  none  the\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would therefore like to recommend that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  review the need to rank JCs and relook  at  the\r\n\r\nreward  system  for our principals and teachers  when  we\r\n\r\nimplement  measures to improve our JC  education  system.\r\n\r\nThere  should  also be less emphasis on  examinations  or\r\n\r\nusing  examination results as a sole criterion to measure\r\n\r\nthe  performances of our students, as well as  principals\r\n\r\nand  teachers.   Unless we do this, our  best  intentions\r\n\r\nbehind the proposed changes may not be realised.  The new\r\n\r\nreward  system should be based on how well our JCs  train\r\n\r\nour  students  to achieve a broader based  education  and\r\n\r\nmaster learning and thinking skills, and not just on  the\r\n\r\nnumber of As obtained in H1 and H2 level subjects in  the\r\n\r\n'A' level examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, still on the subject of incentives and\r\n\r\nrewards for our teachers and principals, I would like  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  issue  of  teaching resources.   In  the  new\r\n\r\nenvironment  envisaged, teachers would  need  to  acquire\r\n\r\nexpertise in teaching and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassessing  students in the areas of thinking  skills  and\r\n\r\ninnovation.   They would need to both set challenges  and\r\n\r\nstructure  courses  to  bring out  these  skills  in  the\r\n\r\nstudents, as well as assess students in these new  areas.\r\n\r\nThis  is  indeed  a fundamental change  in  much  of  our\r\n\r\ntraditional education philosophy.  Our existing  teaching\r\n\r\nresources may not be suitably equipped to meet these  new\r\n\r\nchallenges.   We therefore need to retrain  our  existing\r\n\r\nteaching  staff  to  re-equip them to implement  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  ambitious plans.  I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nif  he  could elaborate on any special training plans  to\r\n\r\ncater for these changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report has indicated that additional teaching\r\n\r\nresources would be required to tide in for the period  up\r\n\r\nto  full  implementation of the new JC education  system.\r\n\r\nWould these new teaching staff resources replace existing\r\n\r\nones?   I  would  like  to seek the  assurance  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that  opportunity  be  given  to  the   current\r\n\r\nteaching staff to fully enable them to adapt to  the  new\r\n\r\nregime.   I  agree that, in the interim, we may  have  to\r\n\r\nimport  foreign talents to help implement these  changes.\r\n\r\nIf  so,  I  would  hope  that specific  plans  for  local\r\n\r\nsuccession, after skills have been acquired and  nurtured\r\n\r\nby  our local teachers, be put in place so that we do not\r\n\r\ncreate  a dependency effect on foreign talents in our  JC\r\n\r\neducation system in the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to raise a suggestion that the\r\n\r\nmother tongue criterion could be broadened to include any\r\n\r\nsecond language.  With Singaporeans expected to study and\r\n\r\nwork  overseas for long periods of time, as part  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic   changes  anticipated,  returning   Singaporean\r\n\r\nfamilies have found that the mother tongue criterion  for\r\n\r\nlocal  schools  too restrictive for  them.   This  is  an\r\n\r\nadditional source of stress for both students and parents\r\n\r\nreturning from overseas.  If we can broaden the criterion\r\n\r\nto  other  languages, making exception for this group  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  returning  from  overseas,  we  might  even\r\n\r\nenhance   Singapore's  future  as  a  globalised  economy\r\n\r\nplugged into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe world.  It would also encourage Singaporeans overseas\r\n\r\nto return and contribute positively to our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the motion moved by the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education.  I agree that we should  change\r\n\r\nour  JC  curriculum to achieve a broader based  education\r\n\r\nand  to  develop  thinking,  communication  and  learning\r\n\r\nskills.   However, I call on the Minister to  review  our\r\n\r\nteaching methods, to place less emphasis on examinations,\r\n\r\nto  do  away  with  ranking of JCs,  and  to  reward  our\r\n\r\nteachers in many other ways.  Examination result  is  but\r\n\r\nonly  one of the ways.  Whilst the desired ends  for  our\r\n\r\neducation  system are well intended, I fear that  we  may\r\n\r\nnot  achieve them if the means towards these ends are not\r\n\r\nproperly addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, may I start by congratulating Senior Minister of\r\n\r\nState  Tharman and his Committee on a very  well  written\r\n\r\nreport   and   one  that  should,  in  general,   receive\r\n\r\nwidespread support; who would oppose after all  injecting\r\n\r\nmore  breadth and flexibility into the JC curriculum  and\r\n\r\nthe proposed education landscape, painting such a picture\r\n\r\nof  options and variety of pathways as to warm the hearts\r\n\r\nof  parents  and students alike.  But the recommendations\r\n\r\ndo  raise  some areas of concern and some questions  that\r\n\r\ncould  do  with some clarifications.  As so  many  of  my\r\n\r\nparliamentary  colleagues also  have  their  comments  to\r\n\r\ncontribute,  I  shall  restrict my observations  to  just\r\n\r\nthree areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, the first question that actually came\r\n\r\nto  my mind when I read through the report was whether we\r\n\r\nhave,  in  fact, got the process upside down  -  back  to\r\n\r\nfront,  focussing all of our attention on  JC  and  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary  education, the last four years  of  our  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans' education, thinking that we can  spend  the\r\n\r\nfirst  most  formative and impressionable  years  of  our\r\n\r\nchildren's  lives,  grilling them and  grinding  away  at\r\n\r\ntheir  self esteem, and then in the final years of  their\r\n\r\nschooling education, we expect to turn them around  on  a\r\n\r\npin and blossom with this new curriculum, albeit it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a  very attractive proposition, and to develop  their\r\n\r\nthinking skills at this very late stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Parliamentary Secretary Koo Tsai Kee gave us\r\n\r\na  very thorough account of the Bronx Science High School\r\n\r\nand  of the five Nobel Laureates which they created.  But\r\n\r\nI  would dare say that the Bronx Science High School  did\r\n\r\nnot  create these five Nobel Laureates out of  thin  air.\r\n\r\nThe  question  for  me  is,  in  fact,  how  these  Nobel\r\n\r\nLaureates'  minds  were  moulded  when  they  were   much\r\n\r\nyounger.   For me, that is an important question.   While\r\n\r\nit is certainly important to look at the finishing stages\r\n\r\nof their education, who is, in fact, looking into what we\r\n\r\nare   going  to  do  with  our  pre-school  and   primary\r\n\r\neducation, to prepare our children for the new world?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, broadening the curriculum is certainly, I\r\n\r\nthink, heading in the right direction.  It will give more\r\n\r\nexposure to our students to more fields of knowledge  and\r\n\r\nallow  them  to  be more well-rounded individuals,  allow\r\n\r\nthem  more opportunities to find areas in which they have\r\n\r\nspecial interests, skills and talents.  The Committee has\r\n\r\nrecommended that this broadening be achieved  in  balance\r\n\r\nwith cutting down on content, and I am all for that.   It\r\n\r\nhas been inexplicable to me all this time in recent years\r\n\r\nthat we have been preaching to the adults on the need for\r\n\r\nlife-long learning, because of the rapid obsolescence  of\r\n\r\nknowledge, that we have kept, at the same time,  stuffing\r\n\r\nthe  heads of our school children with content.   So  the\r\n\r\nacknowledgement that we can and should in  fact  ease  up\r\n\r\nhere  is good news indeed.  However  - and this is a  big\r\n\r\nhowever  - how will the Ministry of Education ensure that\r\n\r\nin developing the new curriculum, we will in fact lighten\r\n\r\nthe  content  load?  Because lightening and  reducing  of\r\n\r\ncurriculum load is not a new story for us.  In  fact,  we\r\n\r\nare   supposed  to  have  already  lightened   curriculum\r\n\r\npreviously  by  as  much as 30%.  In fact,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself this afternoon has spoken with conviction that we\r\n\r\nhave  trimmed down on content, and yet it would seem that\r\n\r\nonly  the  Minister  and his senior  officers  have  this\r\n\r\nconviction,  because just about everybody else  that  you\r\n\r\nspeak to in the system  -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents,  students and teachers alike  - do not  seem  to\r\n\r\nhave experienced any lightening of the curriculum load.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is: how will the Ministry ensure\r\n\r\nthat  this shift of the curriculum from depth to  breadth\r\n\r\ndoes,  in fact, happen and does not result in added load,\r\n\r\nthat  the implementation of the new curriculum will  stay\r\n\r\ntrue to the intent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and final question that I want to raise\r\n\r\nrelates  to the most diverse JC/Upper Secondary education\r\n\r\nlandscape.  I applaud the recommendation.   Alas, it will\r\n\r\nonly be for the top 10% of our children.  Contrary to  Dr\r\n\r\nWang Kai Yuen's anticipation that parents will respond by\r\n\r\nrecognising that different skills will be needed now  for\r\n\r\nsuccess and prepare their children accordingly, I am most\r\n\r\nfearful  that  the  result will  be  even  more  fearsome\r\n\r\npressure  on  our  children sitting for their  PSLE  each\r\n\r\nyear,  to  make  it  to that top 10%, so  that  they  can\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  the  new  integrated  programme  in  their\r\n\r\nsecondary education.  As usual, we are focusing  so  much\r\n\r\nof  our attention, effort and resources on the few at the\r\n\r\ntop.  Why should this diversity of approaches be reserved\r\n\r\nonly  for the top 10%?  We are grateful that the kind  of\r\n\r\nresources  and  opportunities that were previously  given\r\n\r\nonly to the top 1% in the Gifted Education Programme will\r\n\r\nperhaps  now  be available to a wider 10%.   But  is  the\r\n\r\nfocus  on this elite group, in fact, justified?  The  GEP\r\n\r\nhas been in existence now for many years.  Has there been\r\n\r\nan  assessment,  in  fact, of its  outcomes,  other  than\r\n\r\nperhaps the number of President's Scholars that they  may\r\n\r\nhave  produced?   What contributions  have  previous  GEP\r\n\r\ncohorts  made  to  Singapore society?   What  skills  and\r\n\r\nspirit  and values have they developed?  Similarly,  with\r\n\r\nthe  recommendation to establish specialised  independent\r\n\r\nschools  to  cater  to students with special  talents  in\r\n\r\narts, sports, mathematics and science, these schools will\r\n\r\nagain cater only for the very few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served recently on the Economic Review Sub-committee on Enhancing Human Capital and co-chaired the\r\n\r\nWork Group on Arts, Culture, Sports and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecreation.  Our Work Group recommended, not  elite  arts\r\n\r\nand  sports schools, but making arts and sports education\r\n\r\nwidely available to our children in schools so that  more\r\n\r\nof  our  children will imbue the spirit and  values  that\r\n\r\ncome  with these disciplines.  And also, so that we  will\r\n\r\nlose  less  of those who have the skills and  talents  in\r\n\r\nthese areas who would otherwise be left by the wayside in\r\n\r\nour traditional education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at our workforce today, the problem we\r\n\r\nhave  is  not with the top 1% or the top 10%.   They  are\r\n\r\nmore  than able to fend for themselves in the old  world,\r\n\r\nand  in the new, and indeed to contribute to our national\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  The enormous challenge that we face is with\r\n\r\nthe   massive  400,000  workers  at  the  bottom  of  the\r\n\r\nspectrum,  whose world is far removed from the  corridors\r\n\r\nof power and wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask who is looking into the\r\n\r\neducational needs of the future equivalent of this  large\r\n\r\ngroup  of  Singaporeans, who will also have to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe  new challenges and the new demands that will be made\r\n\r\non them in our new and globalised economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I do support the\r\n\r\nmotion, but I would urge Government to further review the\r\n\r\nwhole education system, particularly addressing the needs\r\n\r\nof  our younger, pre-primary and primary school students,\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the broadening of the JC  curriculum  is\r\n\r\nindeed matched with a decrease in content so that  it  is\r\n\r\nmanageable and to avail the improvements to a much  wider\r\n\r\npopulation of students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>7.03 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mdm\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, I am in full support of the motion mainly\r\n\r\nbecause  I  was a member of the Committee  that  did  the\r\n\r\nreview.  In that light, I had actually tried to place  my\r\n\r\nspeech somewhere at the end of the debate by calling  the\r\n\r\nWhip\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquite  late, just before the deadline.  To my  horror,  I\r\n\r\nwas  placed  at  No. 12 and to speak on  the  first  day.\r\n\r\nApparently  my  creativity is not good  enough.   I  hope\r\n\r\nafter  the review, future MPs would be more creative  and\r\n\r\ninnovative in manipulating as to when they would speak in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to touch on a few points and\r\n\r\nthen  later  also touch on the points raised by  my  hon.\r\n\r\nFriends before me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just some background to this review. I see three\r\n\r\nimportant  factors that played in the minds of  both  the\r\n\r\nMinistry and the Review Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the demands of the new economy - which is\r\n\r\ninnovation  driven.   This new  economy  places  a  great\r\n\r\npremium  on  creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nWith  these  great new demands placed upon  our  economy,\r\n\r\nupon our future, what do we do with our education system?\r\n\r\nIf  we  are  just to look at the JCs and upper  secondary\r\n\r\neducation, what do we do about it?  This topic  has  been\r\n\r\ndealt  with and touched upon by my colleagues before  me.\r\n\r\nI will deal with them in a short while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have this syndrome, which we in the\r\n\r\nCommittee  called the \"Coca Cola\" syndrome.  We  have  at\r\n\r\nthe  lower  secondary education level a very broad  based\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  where students take eight to  ten  subjects,\r\n\r\ncovering both the sciences and the humanities, one or two\r\n\r\nlanguages  in addition to that.  Then, at the  university\r\n\r\nlevel,  the first one or two years, it is also  similarly\r\n\r\nbroad based.  Students in the science faculties are  made\r\n\r\nto  take one or two humanities subjects.  Students  doing\r\n\r\nhumanities  are also made to take one or two non-humanity\r\n\r\nsubjects.    But   at  the  pre-university   level,   the\r\n\r\nspecialisation is more pronounced.  We have about 40%  of\r\n\r\nour  science students at pre-university who do  not  take\r\n\r\nany humanities subject.  Yet, when they go to university,\r\n\r\nas  most  of  them  do, they have to take  at  least  one\r\n\r\nhumanities  subject.  So we have to  correct  this  \"Coca\r\n\r\nCola Bottle\" syndrome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the questions that we have to look at here,\r\n\r\nMadam,  is how then do we broaden the curriculum  without\r\n\r\ncompromising depth.  All of us agree that the  rigour  in\r\n\r\nour  system, the standards that we have achieved  in  our\r\n\r\neducational  system are good, we wish it to  remain,  but\r\n\r\nyet  we also want to broaden the curriculum to enable our\r\n\r\nstudents to cover as many subjects as possible.  But  how\r\n\r\ndo  we  achieve this without compromising depth?  So  the\r\n\r\nCommittee came out with this system of having three tiers\r\n\r\nas opposed to the present two tiers in depth.  Presently,\r\n\r\nwe  have the \"AO\" and the \"A\" levels, now we have H1, H2,\r\n\r\nH3, or rather this is the proposed differentiation as far\r\n\r\nas  depth is concerned, so that we can achieve a  greater\r\n\r\namount of breadth without compromising depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third factor in the background is the high\r\n\r\npercentage   of  our  top  10%  of  our  student   cohort\r\n\r\nqualifying for university.  In other words, for them, the\r\n\r\n\"O\"  level is more or less a formality.  Yet, as we  have\r\n\r\nheard  earlier on, if we are to free these students  from\r\n\r\ntaking  their  \"O\" levels, which also means freeing  them\r\n\r\nfrom  taking  or preparing for preliminary  examinations,\r\n\r\nthey would have an additional eight to ten months of free\r\n\r\ntime  -  eight to ten months where they can benefit  from\r\n\r\nother enhancements or enrichment projects and programmes.\r\n\r\nSo  the  question then is:  can we do away with  the  \"O\"\r\n\r\nlevel examinations for them, and if we are to do it,  how\r\n\r\ndo we manage the fall out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, when we consider the new\r\n\r\ndemands,  the  demands of the new economy,  and  when  we\r\n\r\nspeak  of  innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship,  and\r\n\r\nwhen we try to look at the education system where we  ask\r\n\r\nourselves, \"So what do we do with the education system in\r\n\r\norder  to meet these new demands\", among the things  that\r\n\r\nfirst strike my mind is how to improve the curriculum  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  enhancing thought process skills over  content\r\n\r\nmastery or accumulation of information.  I think this has\r\n\r\nbeen  discussed.  We see there are efforts being made  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the value of project work, highlighting  thought\r\n\r\nprocess skills over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontent  mastery  in  pedagogy or  teaching  methodology.\r\n\r\nThese ideas had been dealt with by the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect in relation to innovation and\r\n\r\ncreativity is to develop within the curriculum a means by\r\n\r\nwhich  students are able to draw knowledge from different\r\n\r\ndisciplines.   In other words, it is not  sufficient  for\r\n\r\nthem  to merely learn.  When it is already not sufficient\r\n\r\nfor them to learn from one particular body knowledge, now\r\n\r\nit  is  also  not  sufficient  for  them  to  learn  from\r\n\r\ndifferent  bodies  of knowledge, but we  would  encourage\r\n\r\nstudents to be able to draw lessons from different bodies\r\n\r\nof knowledge at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, one of the most known icons of\r\n\r\nour  time  are  the producers of the Star  Wars  Trilogy,\r\n\r\nSteven Spielberg and George Lucas.  The Star Wars Trilogy\r\n\r\nis  very  captivating, partly because I think within  one\r\n\r\nshow   you  see  different  bodies  of  knowledge  coming\r\n\r\ntogether.   It has, well, this may be controversial,  but\r\n\r\nto  my mind, high literature value because it has a  very\r\n\r\nidentifiable theme or themes.  It has simple  plots  that\r\n\r\ncriss-cross one another.  It has lots of wit and  humour.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  literature aspect.   Then  it  deals  with\r\n\r\nscience  and technology, whether futuristic or  fictional\r\n\r\nsometimes.  You have, for instance, the three-dimensional\r\n\r\nrecording  of Princess Leah talking to whoever  that  may\r\n\r\nbe.   In  the first show it was Luke Skywalker, I  think,\r\n\r\nreceiving the message that he was supposed to see  Obiwan\r\n\r\nKanobi.    Then  we  have  this  fantastic   Death   Star\r\n\r\nconstruction,  which was Darth Vader's headquarters.   We\r\n\r\nhave  fancy flying machines.  We have flying saucers that\r\n\r\ncan  presumably travel at the speed of light.  Well, that\r\n\r\nis the science aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the aspect of politics and governance.\r\n\r\nWe  have  the clash between the Empire and small planets.\r\n\r\nWe  have  the  knighthood of the Jedi.  This  is  another\r\n\r\nelement  of the Star Wars Trilogy.  We have the marketing\r\n\r\npart.  Besides advertisements, they have toys, they  have\r\n\r\ngames,  they  publish books and comics.   In  short,  Mdm\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, that movie, or that trilogy of movies  is\r\n\r\na multi-faceted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustry,  and  to  my mind the producers  were  able  to\r\n\r\ncaptivate the imagination of the world because they  drew\r\n\r\nfrom  various bodies of knowledge, put them together  and\r\n\r\ncame out with a solid product that nobody else could have\r\n\r\ndone.   If local producers are to be capable of similarly\r\n\r\ncaptivating the imagination of the world, then I  believe\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  develop  that  capability  to  draw  from\r\n\r\ndifferent bodies of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability to draw from different bodies of\r\n\r\nknowledge  must  mean  that they  have  a  grasp  of  the\r\n\r\ndifferent bodies of knowledge to begin with.  So it  must\r\n\r\nmean a broadening, at some point in time, the curriculum.\r\n\r\nI  am afraid it has to mean a certain degree of workload.\r\n\r\nIt will have to mean that students must be able to study,\r\n\r\nand  must have to undertake the rigour and the difficulty\r\n\r\nof   studying  different  types  of  subjects,  including\r\n\r\nsubjects that they may not be totally happy with  because\r\n\r\nit  is  a bit different from what their aptitude is  best\r\n\r\nat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members spoke of the need to lighten the load.\r\n\r\nI think what is more crucial here, Mdm Deputy Speaker, is\r\n\r\nnot  so much to have a lightened workload but to have  an\r\n\r\nenlightened  workload.  An enlightened workload  means  a\r\n\r\nworkload that takes into account the need to prepare  our\r\n\r\nstudents for the future as opposed to simply helping them\r\n\r\ngo through the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the review, Mdm Deputy Speaker, is\r\n\r\ncommunication  skills.  We have heard just  now  from  my\r\n\r\nfellow Members that Singaporeans somehow are not able  to\r\n\r\ncommunicate  well.  This was in fact one  of  the  points\r\n\r\nraised  by some of the Review Committee members and  some\r\n\r\nof  the feedback that we received.  So here, I think  the\r\n\r\nCommittee tried to overcome this problem by enhancing  or\r\n\r\nemphasising the need for project work, where they have to\r\n\r\ndevelop  teamwork  and then in the  presentation  of  the\r\n\r\nproject  work  they  will have to  develop  communication\r\n\r\nskills.  So in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresentation of project work the students will then  have\r\n\r\nto  develop  skills in communication so as to impress  or\r\n\r\nconvince the examiners of the worth of their project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, the General Paper is a subject that is\r\n\r\nfeared by most students.  When we introduce project work,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a general reaction among students and teachers\r\n\r\nthat  this will increase workload or stress.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  any  of us will want to increase the  workload  or\r\n\r\nstress  for the fun of it.  I do not think any of us  are\r\n\r\nmorbid enough to have that kind of sense of humour.   But\r\n\r\nit is something which we need to do based on the comments\r\n\r\nthat  we  get very often from the public and  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  that Singaporeans are not good at  speaking,\r\n\r\nnot good at communicating, or not articulate.  So we have\r\n\r\nto  do something about it.  We have to improve our system\r\n\r\nand  among  the things that we can do is to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nquality  of teaching GP as well as project work.   And  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that, in the long term, this will have the effect\r\n\r\nthat  all  of  us  desire.  We would be able  to  produce\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who would be able to market their  products\r\n\r\nbetter,  who  would be able to articulate and communicate\r\n\r\nbetter and, hopefully, make life in Singapore as a  whole\r\n\r\nmuch better too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just two more points, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I do not\r\n\r\nwish to be long because I wish to break my fast also.   I\r\n\r\nagree  with  the  points  raised by  my  colleagues  that\r\n\r\nteachers  play a very important role in this.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nteachers have told us that looking at the recommendations\r\n\r\nand  reviews,  they  are  very concerned  as  to  whether\r\n\r\nteachers and principals are ready for the review  because\r\n\r\nthey  realise,  just as everyone here also realises  that\r\n\r\nthe  method of teaching has to be kept in line  with  the\r\n\r\nsubstantive  recommendations.   Indeed,  the  method   of\r\n\r\nteaching,  if  not rightly aligned, might even  undermine\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations.  So, as stated by  MOS  Cedric  Foo\r\n\r\njust  now,  the teachers would have some  way  to  go  in\r\n\r\nmaking  the necessary changes, and I have full confidence\r\n\r\nthat our teachers will do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we have already received feedback that the\r\n\r\nteaching profession is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  stress.   What more with the new  recommendations!\r\n\r\nBut,  again, I reiterate that it is no fun adding  stress\r\n\r\nto  the  lives of teachers, as it is no fun adding stress\r\n\r\nto  the  lives  of students.  But looking  again  at  the\r\n\r\nfuture  that  we  are facing, the new  demands  that  are\r\n\r\nbefore  us,  what choice do we have?  Something  that  we\r\n\r\nhave to do for our children, for our country, what I  can\r\n\r\njust say here is that I have full confidence the teachers\r\n\r\ntoo will align themselves with the new recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, as regards parents, Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nthey  will  find the changes quite painful and  sometimes\r\n\r\nquite bewildering.  I think parents would need great help\r\n\r\nto understand the changes.  I do not think it is possible\r\n\r\nfor parents to be able to grasp all the changes in one go\r\n\r\nand  it  may not be necessary for them to do so too.   So\r\n\r\nhere,  there  will  be a need for stronger  collaboration\r\n\r\nbetween  parents and schools so that they will  be  given\r\n\r\nthe  right dosages of information at the right  point  in\r\n\r\ntime.   In this respect, I believe schools will take  the\r\n\r\nnecessary measures to have contact points with parents as\r\n\r\ntheir children progress in school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will touch on some of the points raised by my\r\n\r\ncolleagues before me as regards the Integrated Programme.\r\n\r\nOne concern was whether or not this is a higher level  of\r\n\r\nstreaming.   The first response to that is: is  streaming\r\n\r\nby  itself  a problem?  If it is not, a higher  level  of\r\n\r\nstreaming  is not a bigger problem.  But even  if  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  we  ought  to be  concerned  about,  the\r\n\r\nresponse to that would be to weigh the benefits of having\r\n\r\nthe Integrated Programme as not having it.  Here, we have\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to free up about eight to 10  months  of\r\n\r\nthe  time of our best students when they do not  need  to\r\n\r\ntake their 'O' level examinations.  If you can do it, why\r\n\r\nnot?   Sure,  we are concerned with the others.   But  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect, there is nothing much that we can do about\r\n\r\nthe  others.  In this particular aspect, must we  deprive\r\n\r\nthe  best from something which they otherwise could  get?\r\n\r\nIn fact, we get feedback from everyone that our system is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo  rigid, too book-centred.  So perhaps these eight  to\r\n\r\n10 months are perfect for them to go out and do something\r\n\r\nelse,  like fire fighting perhaps, as what some  students\r\n\r\ndo in the United States, and community work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was this concern that the IP programme would\r\n\r\nalso  widen the gap between the very best and the not-so-good.   Perhaps, we can use these eight to 10  months  to\r\n\r\ninculcate  among  the top 10% students the  values  that,\r\n\r\neven  though  they can fly high, they must remember  that\r\n\r\nwhen  they  nest, they must nest on solid  ground.   When\r\n\r\nthey  land,  they must land on firm feet.  They  must  be\r\n\r\ntrue  Singaporeans,  good citizens, good  sons  and  good\r\n\r\ndaughters,  that they have to respect their  parents  and\r\n\r\nlove their neighbours and help those who are in need.  So\r\n\r\nwe  can  use  these eight to 10 months to do that,  which\r\n\r\notherwise  they  may not have the time if  they  have  to\r\n\r\nprepare   for  preliminary  examination  and  'O'   level\r\n\r\nexamination.  So as far as they are concerned,  they  are\r\n\r\nvalid  ones.  But I think on balance it is better  if  we\r\n\r\ncan  do away with the 'O' level examinations, we do  away\r\n\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not prolong everyone's agony any further. I\r\n\r\nstand in support of the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, we had a\r\n\r\nfull  day  of  debate.

The\r\n\r\nprogramme  was  started in 1992 and  implemented  in  all\r\n\r\nprimary  schools  in  1998. The need for  this  programme\r\n\r\narises out of the complex home language background of our\r\n\r\nstudents, resulting in their entering Primary 1 with very\r\n\r\ndifferent  levels  of  literacy skills  in  English.  The\r\n\r\nprogramme provides additional support to pupils in P1 and\r\n\r\nP2 who do not have the pre-requisite English Language and\r\n\r\nliteracy skills to access the curriculum. Pupils  in  the\r\n\r\nLSP  are identified through a screening test administered\r\n\r\nto  all  P1  pupils at the beginning of the school  year.\r\n\r\nEach  year, about 12% to 14% of P1 pupils, or some  7,000\r\n\r\npupils, are supported in the LSP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effectiveness of the programme is measured\r\n\r\nthrough   gains   in   children's  reading   levels   and\r\n\r\nperformance in school-based assessments.  P1  LSP  pupils\r\n\r\nstart school reading at levels equivalent to children  of\r\n\r\nless  than  5  years of age, on average. After  about  10\r\n\r\nmonths  of  intervention in the LSP, the average  reading\r\n\r\nage  of LSP pupils is 7 years, reflecting a reading  gain\r\n\r\nof  28  months.   They are thus comparable  with  the  P1\r\n\r\ncohort in terms of their reading levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvements in reading have helped the pupils do\r\n\r\nbetter  in  their English tests.  For example,  in  2001,\r\n\r\nless  than half (45%) of P1 LSP pupils passed English  at\r\n\r\nthe  mid-year  Semestral  Assessment  (SA1).  By  SA2  in\r\n\r\nNovember, the pass rate was 64.9%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration of the Learning Support Programme is 2\r\n\r\nyears. At the end of P2, a small proportion of LSP pupils\r\n\r\n(about 15% of those originally identified at P1) continue\r\n\r\nto  have  difficulties in the English Language.   Schools\r\n\r\nwill  determine the most appropriate mode of support  for\r\n\r\nthese  pupils  after  the 2 years in the  LSP  programme.\r\n\r\nThese  pupils  are  put  through  customised  remediation\r\n\r\nprogrammes  conducted  by  the  school,  or  the   ENABLE\r\n\r\n(ENcouraging   Achievement  and   Better   LEarning),   a\r\n\r\nspecialised   intervention  programme  in   English   and\r\n\r\nMathematics for pupils who are underachieving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TAXI SECURITY DEVICES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nTransport  whether he will consider making it  compulsory\r\n\r\nfor  taxi companies to install security devices in  their\r\n\r\ntaxis to give protection to taxi drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, taxis are privately operated.
