Of these, 3,278  were\r\n\r\nreported  under the new Act which came into  force  in\r\n\r\nthat year. When the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1971\r\n\r\nwas  repealed and the 1975 Act came into being,  among\r\n\r\nother   things,   the  new  Act  included   industrial\r\n\r\ndermatitis  and noise-induced deafness as  compensable\r\n\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  was  in  line  with  the  Ministry's  policy  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  in  its  effort to improve  the  health  and\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  workers and to bring the  legislation  in\r\n\r\nline  with  the  modern  working  environment  -  that\r\n\r\nutilises chemicals and other irritants that can  cause\r\n\r\nserious  skin  ailments if workers are  not  protected\r\n\r\nagainst  them  through barrier creams  or  appropriate\r\n\r\ngloves.  In addition the high noise levels in  certain\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sectors could probably deafen workers if\r\n\r\nthey are not adequately protected with ear protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of this legislation, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that some cases of industrial dermatitis  and\r\n\r\nnoise-induced deafness must have been compensated. The\r\n\r\nlatest  Ministry of Labour annual report.  1975, does\r\n\r\nnot  carry  any figures of compensation paid  out  for\r\n\r\nthese  two  compensable diseases. Perhaps  it  is  too\r\n\r\nearly  for such cases to have emerged, as the law  was\r\n\r\nonly  then  three months' old. But as the 1976  annual\r\n\r\nreport is not available (I do not know whether  it  is\r\n\r\nstill  being printed or being prepared), I would  like\r\n\r\nto  know  the latest figures of compensation paid  out\r\n\r\nand  the  number  of cases concerned, separately,  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  these  two  diseases,  since  they   were\r\n\r\nincluded in the Schedule to the Workmen's Compensation\r\n\r\nAct as compensable diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister also enlighten the House whether\r\n\r\nthese  workers obtained alternative employment or  are\r\n\r\nstill  employed in the same establishment  where  they\r\n\r\ncontracted the diseases? If they are still employed by\r\n\r\nthe  same employer, are they in the same jobs as  they\r\n\r\nwere prior to contracting these diseases?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, I am raising the\r\n\r\nquestion  in relation to the workings of the Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation Act. As we know, the patients, i.e, the\r\n\r\nworkers, are submitted to medical examination and  the\r\n\r\nextent  of permanent or temporary incapacity  is  then\r\n\r\ncertified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here a copy of the Workmen's Compensation\r\n\r\nGuide  and  a  copy  of the medical  report  (standard\r\n\r\nformat)  upon  which  doctors  have  to  fill  in  the\r\n\r\nparticulars. I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggesting  here  that  the  present  format  for  the\r\n\r\noperation  of the Workmen's Compensation  Act  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient and does not give a clear-cut indication as\r\n\r\nto  the workings of the Workmen's Compensation Act. It\r\n\r\nis  not my intention to question the quantum of  award\r\n\r\nfor  workmen's compensation. Neither am I  questioning\r\n\r\nthe guidelines for the award for specific loss of limb\r\n\r\nor  part of it, although I have my own reservation  on\r\n\r\nsome   of   these  guidelines.  I  am  referring,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, to this format which the certifying doctor\r\n\r\nwill  have to fill in, and this can be improved if  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  better tabulated in terms of  temporary  or\r\n\r\npermanent loss. On top of this, in the interest of the\r\n\r\ninjured  person, a form of Compensation Medical  Board\r\n\r\nshould be established. This would then allow for  more\r\n\r\nequitable,    more   expert   and    fairer    medical\r\n\r\ncertification  for  injuries  sustained  or   diseases\r\n\r\ncontracted  during employment. We know at the  present\r\n\r\nmoment,  all  and sundry among the medical  profession\r\n\r\nattend  to  workmen's compensation. This  ranges  from\r\n\r\nexpert  professors  and  consultants  to  very   young\r\n\r\ndoctors who have barely one year's medical experience.\r\n\r\nI  could  quote examples where a workman who  deserved\r\n\r\nonly  5%  compensation award was granted 60%.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand  the injured person who deserved  30%  was\r\n\r\ngiven just 5% compensation. Therefore, in the interest\r\n\r\nof  the  injured person, may I kindly suggest  that  a\r\n\r\nWorkmen's Compensation Board be established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are insufficient guidelines provided for other\r\n\r\nelements  like emotional or ethnic characteristics  of\r\n\r\nthe  injured  person. This is important  because  very\r\n\r\noften  if  an  injured person knows  how  to  play  up\r\n\r\ncertain residual symptoms, he or she tends to get away\r\n\r\nwith  more  awards.

Very often we do face this problem  and\r\n\r\nas  a  result of mismanagement the result of treatment\r\n\r\nis  appalling,  and  yet  the same  person  comes  and\r\n\r\nexpects to be compensated for this. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink  some guidelines too should be provided in  this\r\n\r\ndirection. I am making this request, bearing  in  mind\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the injured person and  in  the  name\r\n\r\naffair play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Sir, may I first deal\r\n\r\nwith  the points raised by the hon. Member for  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir.  Briefly,  the  Member is  concerned  with  two\r\n\r\nmatters,  that  is, industrial dermatitis  and  noise-induced  deafness. For the benefit of Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  industrial  dermatitis  simply  means  a  skin\r\n\r\ndisease.  So  I prefer to use this term  from  now  on\r\n\r\ninstead   of  using  the  technical  term.  Industrial\r\n\r\ndermatitis  and noise-induced deafness were  added  to\r\n\r\nthe  list  of compensable occupational diseases  under\r\n\r\nthe  Workmen's Compensation Act, 1975.  It  came  into\r\n\r\noperation on the 1st October of that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On skin diseases, the Ministry has not conducted any\r\n\r\nsurvey  recently  but the figures of notification  for\r\n\r\nthe   past  two  years  for  these  two  diseases  are\r\n\r\navailable, and for the information of Members they are\r\n\r\nas follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 9 cases of skin diseases in 1975 and 187\r\n\r\nin  1976.  For  noise-induced deafness,  no  case  was\r\n\r\nregistered  in  1975 and 912 cases  were  detected  in\r\n\r\n1976.  Hon.  Members  should not be  alarmed  by  this\r\n\r\nfigure as I will explain further on this. 870 of these\r\n\r\nwere early cases and only 42 cases were what we regard\r\n\r\nas  proper cases. So do not be alarmed with  the  high\r\n\r\nfigure.  The reason for the increase in the number  of\r\n\r\nskin  diseases  confirmed  in  1976  was  due  to  the\r\n\r\ncompulsory   reporting  of  these  cases  by   medical\r\n\r\npractitioners under the law. Prior to that, there  was\r\n\r\nno  requirement. So there might be cases that did  not\r\n\r\ncome  to the attention of the Ministry of Labour. Most\r\n\r\nof  these  skin diseases were due to the  handling  of\r\n\r\nengineering oil or some raw materials, about 56.7%  of\r\n\r\nthem  resulted  from the handling of engineering  oil;\r\n\r\n10.7%  from handling of resins; 8.6% due to  solvents;\r\n\r\nanother  8.6% due to handling of fibreglass;  2.1%  on\r\n\r\ncement; 2.1% on paint; and the others about 11.2%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A programme of prevention has been developed and the\r\n\r\nmain  task  of  this programme was  the  education  of\r\n\r\nworkers  to  minimise skin contact with the irritating\r\n\r\nand  allergic  substances through the  use  of  proper\r\n\r\nprotective  covering,  such as  protective  clothings,\r\n\r\naprons,  gloves, face shields and other barrier  cream\r\n\r\nwhich  the Member for Potong Pasir mentioned  earlier.\r\n\r\nTo  launch  this  programme the Ministry  printed  and\r\n\r\ndistributed  3,500 copies of a pamphlet on  industrial\r\n\r\nskin  diseases in two languages, namely,  Chinese  and\r\n\r\nEnglish,  and 1,800 copies of this pamphlet have  been\r\n\r\ndistributed to the various industries with known risks\r\n\r\nof  industrial  skin diseases, such as the  electronic\r\n\r\nfactories, woodworking where they deal with a  certain\r\n\r\nkind   of  adhesive  gum,  cement, paint  and   other\r\n\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are probably aware that industrial skin\r\n\r\ndiseases are by and large a transient kind of disease.\r\n\r\nThey are temporary in the sense that the condition may\r\n\r\nlast  for  only  a few days to a few  weeks  and  very\r\n\r\nrarely  result in residual disability. Once the worker\r\n\r\nis  detected  and is removed from the contact  of  the\r\n\r\noffending   substance   or  is   isolated   from   the\r\n\r\nenvironment, his condition invariably improves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the great increase of 912 cases of\r\n\r\nnoise-induced deafness reported was largely due to the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the  mobile  audiometric   screening\r\n\r\nprogramme for the noisy industries. It was started  in\r\n\r\nMay  1977. The screening programme covered a total  of\r\n\r\n1,731  employees from 33 shipyards and  942  employees\r\n\r\nfrom  20 other noisy industries, such as the bottling,\r\n\r\ncement  and  concrete  pipe-manufacturing  factories,\r\n\r\netc.  By the end of 1976, a total of 912 noise-induced\r\n\r\ndeafness  cases were detected. The majority  of  these\r\n\r\ncases were in the early stages and only a small number\r\n\r\nof  42  cases were severe enough to attract  workmen's\r\n\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has developed a hearing conservation\r\n\r\nprogramme as a preventive measure to control noise-induced deafness. The main emphasis of this hearing\r\n\r\nconservation programme, which has been widely\r\n\r\npublicised, is to educate and persuade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers  to put on hearing protectors while  at  work.\r\n\r\nNoise   control  is  carried  out  only  when  it   is\r\n\r\nconsidered  technically and economically  feasible  by\r\n\r\nthe factories. Pamphlets on noise-induced deafness  in\r\n\r\nthree languages. Chinese. English and Malay, and  also\r\n\r\na  booklet on the hearing conservation programme  have\r\n\r\nbeen published and distributed free of charge to those\r\n\r\nindustries with the risk of hearing loss. About  3,000\r\n\r\nof  the  pamphlets  have  been  distributed  to  noisy\r\n\r\nfactories,  such  as  shipyards, textiles,  metal  and\r\n\r\nother manufacturing establishments. Over 600 copies of\r\n\r\nthe  hearing conservation programme booklets have been\r\n\r\ndistributed  to  shipyards, metal  can  manufacturing.\r\n\r\nwoodworking, textile and other factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage. I might wish to draw a line that the\r\n\r\nhearing conservation programme is distinct from  noise\r\n\r\npollution  control. In the United States,  there  were\r\n\r\narguments  as  to whether 90 decibels  should  be  the\r\n\r\naccepted norm instead of 85 decibels. So there  was  a\r\n\r\nresearch  trying  to  reduce 90 decibels  down  to  85\r\n\r\ndecibels  and  they discovered that  for  every  point\r\n\r\nreduced  from  90  to 85 decibels it  would  cost  the\r\n\r\nindustry somewhere around US$2 billion. I do not think\r\n\r\nSingapore  has reached that stage to mount that  noise\r\n\r\npollution  control  which is quite distinct  from  the\r\n\r\nhearing conservation programme. So we are launching on\r\n\r\na  more practical approach to this problem rather than\r\n\r\nthrow the problem out of its proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to give the hon.

Member for Kim Seng.\r\n\r\nThe  Workmen's  Compensation Act  provides  sufficient\r\n\r\nbasis  and guidelines for the award of loss of earning\r\n\r\ncapacity  in respect of permanent incapacity  suffered\r\n\r\nby  our workmen as a result of injuries while at work.\r\n\r\nThe First Schedule to the Act specifies the percentage\r\n\r\nto  be  awarded  for the loss of use  of  the  various\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the body. The listing in the Schedule  is\r\n\r\nvery  comprehensive and covers even the loss of  parts\r\n\r\nof  a  member,  that  is, for  example,  the  loss  of\r\n\r\nphalanx.  There  is  therefore no difficulty  for  the\r\n\r\ndoctor to make an award for such injuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I agree with the Member that there are\r\n\r\ncertain  types  of injuries, such as  those  involving\r\n\r\nfractures  or  internal injury which cannot  be  quite\r\n\r\neasily  determined as to the loss of capacity. It  may\r\n\r\nbe  possible to have differing medical assessments  on\r\n\r\nthe  loss  of  use of the part concerned.  Where  such\r\n\r\ndifferences of opinion occur, although very rarely, it\r\n\r\nis  the  practice of the Ministry to refer the injured\r\n\r\nworkman  for  a final assessment by a specialist.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  aware  of  the need  for  uniformity  in\r\n\r\nmedical assessment for these types of injuries. It is,\r\n\r\nin  fact, taking steps to seek the assistance  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health to draw up guidelines for  doctors\r\n\r\nto  follow  on the same basis as those listed  on  the\r\n\r\nFirst Schedule of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether or not we should constitute a board or\r\n\r\npanel. I think the objective is the same. Rather  than\r\n\r\nset up another administrative barrier, which may cause\r\n\r\ndelay to compensation being awarded, I think the  main\r\n\r\nobjective is to ensure uniformity. I will bear in mind\r\n\r\nthe  Member's suggestion, which is a good one. We will\r\n\r\nlook into that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of an injured workman who refuses\r\n\r\ntreatment, the Workmen's Compensation Act provides for\r\n\r\nsuspension  of  his  right to  compensation  until  he\r\n\r\noffers  himself  for a medical examination.  The  hon.\r\n\r\nMember has mentioned that there are a few cases  where\r\n\r\nthe  injured  worker,  having  submitted  himself  for\r\n\r\ntreatment, subsequently stopped medication and  sought\r\n\r\nthe treatment of physicians of traditional methods who\r\n\r\nare registered medical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npractitioners.  I must say that this  is  a  dangerous\r\n\r\npractice  and  the  injury may be aggravated,  and  if\r\n\r\nconfirmed by the doctor treating him, might result  in\r\n\r\nlegal  complication and the objection by the insurance\r\n\r\ncompany  on  the quantum of the final compensation.  I\r\n\r\nwould  appreciate  that if such  cases  do  occur  the\r\n\r\ndoctor  treating the worker should refer the  case  to\r\n\r\nus.  So  far,  there are very, very  few  such  cases,\r\n\r\nfortunately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other irregularity mentioned by\r\n\r\nthe Member about the differences in the sensitivity to\r\n\r\npain  experienced by different workers, with different\r\n\r\ncultural backgrounds, some workers cannot bear to  see\r\n\r\nthe  sight of an injection needle, it must be  pointed\r\n\r\nout  that  workmen's compensation, unlike  the  common\r\n\r\nlaw,  does  not take into consideration such  factors.\r\n\r\nThe compensation awarded under the Act is based solely\r\n\r\non  the  objective yardstick of the  loss  of  earning\r\n\r\ncapacity.   Subjective  factors  such  as   pain   and\r\n\r\nsuffering should not be included in the assessment  of\r\n\r\ncompensation to be paid under the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have answered the questions raised by the\r\n\r\nhon. Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, one point of\r\n\r\nclarification.  The  Senior  Parliamentary   Secretary\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  the  booklet was published  in  three\r\n\r\nlanguages.  I want to know what are the languages  and\r\n\r\nwhether Tamil is included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I am very sorry, Sir. The three\r\n\r\nlanguages    are   English,   Chinese    and    Malay.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  we left out Tamil because  we  believe\r\n\r\nmost  of  the Tamil workers do read English.  And  for\r\n\r\nreasons  of  cost and coverage, we believe  the  three\r\n\r\nlanguages would suffice to cover the entire workforce.\r\n\r\nIf  there is a need in some particular industry  where\r\n\r\nTamil  workers  are in the majority, we  will  produce\r\n\r\nfuture booklets with Tamil in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, three points of clarification.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour stated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the noise level of 90 decibels was considered  in\r\n\r\nthe  United  States  and after  some  discussion  they\r\n\r\ndecided not to belabour this particular problem due to\r\n\r\nits  cost. But I do believe that noise levels are  not\r\n\r\nthe only ones to be considered but also exposure time.\r\n\r\nMaybe  the  Senior  Parliamentary Secretary  had  just\r\n\r\nmissed  It  out  inadvertently. I believe  it  is  six\r\n\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point with regard to noise-induced\r\n\r\ndeafness, the quantum of compensation paid out has not\r\n\r\nbeen  answered  by  the  Parliamentary  Secretary.  He\r\n\r\nmentioned  about 2,000-plus workers were  screened  by\r\n\r\nthe audiometric testing facilities at the Ministry.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve   there  are  24,000  workers  in  about   400\r\n\r\nfactories  with  high  noise  levels.  How  does   the\r\n\r\nMinistry intend to cover all these. And when  they  do\r\n\r\nso,  will the levels of noise-induced deafness and the\r\n\r\nquantum of compensation shoot up to a fantastic  level\r\n\r\nthat could frighten us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, the accepted noise level in\r\n\r\nthe  United States should not be taken as a yardstick\r\n\r\nfor  our purpose. In fact, the problem in the  United\r\n\r\nStates  has  grown beyond the question of  protecting\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  As I have said, there is a  difference\r\n\r\nbetween   noise   pollution   control   and   hearing\r\n\r\nconservation.  We  are adopting hearing  conservation\r\n\r\nbut  not  noise  pollution  control.  In  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  this problem has grown far beyond  the  scope\r\n\r\nof  industrial  health.

I am afraid that up  till\r\n\r\nnow  no compensation has been paid to any of those  42\r\n\r\ncases. They are still under medical assessment. To  be\r\n\r\nfair  to  the  workers, we need to observe  them,  and\r\n\r\nuntil such time when the doctor is satisfied that they\r\n\r\ndeserve  a  certain  percentage of compensation,  they\r\n\r\nshall be paid according to the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not talking\r\n\r\nabout  noise level.

Although this question has  been\r\n\r\nraised many a time in the past in this House, and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   has  been  urged  to  take  more  effective\r\n\r\nmeasures   to   reduce   its  occurrence,   industrial\r\n\r\naccidents continue to recur now and then. According to\r\n\r\nstatistics,  there  were  4,252  cases  of  industrial\r\n\r\naccidents in 1976 and in 1975 there were 3,827 showing\r\n\r\nan  increase of 425 cases. In 1975 there were 67 fatal\r\n\r\ncases, whereas in 1976 there were 62 cases, showing a\r\n\r\nslight  decrease. Just about a week ago  there  was  a\r\n\r\nserious industrial accident at the Senoko Power  Plant\r\n\r\nin  Sembawang which resulted in three deaths and three\r\n\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worth mentioning is that among industrial\r\n\r\naccident   figures   for  the  building   construction\r\n\r\nindustry, those relating to HDB worksites rate quite a\r\n\r\nhigh  proportion. According to Volume 2, No. 8 of  Lao\r\n\r\ngong zhi shi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) the Chinese equivalent of the\r\n\r\n\"New Worker\" published by the Educational Publications\r\n\r\nBureau,  in 1975 there were 651 industrial  accidents\r\n\r\nin building sites, of which 155 cases involved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  HDB, and from January to July 1977 there were 177\r\n\r\naccidents  involving HDB worksites, among which  there\r\n\r\nwere  16  fatality cases. This shows  that  there  are\r\n\r\nstill  many  shortcomings and  loopholes  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nworksite  safety  measures.  There  should   be   more\r\n\r\nstringent control and supervision. The supervisory  or\r\n\r\nmanagerial   officers  should   have   been   severely\r\n\r\nreprimanded, because it is not a small matter that  so\r\n\r\nmany  precious lives have been lost and so  many  able\r\n\r\nbodied persons have been seriously incapacitated.  Had\r\n\r\nthere  been  better  safety precautions  taken,  these\r\n\r\nunnecessary losses would have been avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of safety precautions. I remember that\r\n\r\nsome  two  years  ago  the Institute  of  Occupational\r\n\r\nHealth  and  Safety was set up to look into industrial\r\n\r\nhealth  and safety and related matters. Now after  two\r\n\r\nyears  of  research they must have some  valuable  and\r\n\r\nconcrete proposals to make. I would like to know  what\r\n\r\nare  the  results of the last two years and  what  are\r\n\r\ntheir recommendations. When will these recommendations\r\n\r\nbe put into effect to reduce industrial accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other than the shipbuilding industry which\r\n\r\nshows a decreasing number of accident cases, there are\r\n\r\nstill   many   serious   accidents   involving   other\r\n\r\nindustries,  particularly  the  building  construction\r\n\r\nindustry. There were 698 cases last year. This  is  an\r\n\r\narea  which we should pay attention to. Since we  have\r\n\r\nvarious  industrial safety provisions, they should  be\r\n\r\nstringently carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister explained that there was a shortage of\r\n\r\ninspectors  and  the funds allocated  by  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinistry  were not sufficient. I am quite in  sympathy\r\n\r\nwith  the  Minister. However. I feel that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of life and death. It is not a small matter  to\r\n\r\nbe  treated lightly. The Ministry concerned should try\r\n\r\nits  best  to get more funds from the Finance Ministry\r\n\r\nin  order  to employ more inspectors. The Inspectorate\r\n\r\nnow  has  77 permanent officers, including inspectors,\r\n\r\nin  relation to tens of thousands of factories. I feel\r\n\r\nthe number is too small. More inspectors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nshould   be  recruited,  in  order  to  ensure  better\r\n\r\nindustrial safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Sembawang. He has produced  facts  and\r\n\r\nfigures which I want to talk about further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What safety measures are being introduced in\r\n\r\nfactories,  worksites and shipyards?  There  does  not\r\n\r\nseem to be a reduction in the number of fatal cases at\r\n\r\nthese  places. There seems to be too much  complacency\r\n\r\non  the part of the employers and the Labour Ministry.\r\n\r\nDuring the last one year, there have been a number  of\r\n\r\nfatal  accident cases in shipyards and  worksites.  It\r\n\r\nlooks  as  though life is cheap in these places,  very\r\n\r\ncheap.  Lately, the accident involving a mobile  crane\r\n\r\nat  the  Senoko  Power  Station worksite  could  be  a\r\n\r\ntypical   example  of  a  possible  lack   of   proper\r\n\r\nsupervision, and the overall careless attitude to life\r\n\r\nat  worksites.  Human  life is cheap'  Despite  safety\r\n\r\ncampaigns, which are sporadic at the most, there seems\r\n\r\nto  be no reduction in accidents involving the loss of\r\n\r\nlife  and  limb at shipyards, worksites and factories.\r\n\r\nThe  safety units and factory inspectorate must really\r\n\r\nexpand and wake up!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a shortage of inspectors and they cannot\r\n\r\nsufficiently enforce safety measures at the worksites.\r\n\r\nEverywhere  buildings  are coming  up, shipyards  and\r\n\r\nother worksites. There are not enough inspectors.  The\r\n\r\nLabour   Ministry  should  increase  the  Inspectorate\r\n\r\nstaff.  Later we will then see whether there  are  any\r\n\r\nmore accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact the\r\n\r\nshortest  answer  to these two proposals  is  yes,  we\r\n\r\nwelcome  more staff. Definitely it will do us a  whole\r\n\r\nworld of good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I deal with the specific points raised by\r\n\r\nboth   the  Member  for  Anson  and  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nSembawang,  perhaps I might take this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nenlighten  the  two  Members  on  certain  statistical\r\n\r\ninformation which they might have read from the  Press\r\n\r\nfrom  time to time and on which they might have  based\r\n\r\ntheir  observations.  The  Member  for  Sembawang  has\r\n\r\nquoted the correct\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatistics. Could the Member for Potong Pasir,  please\r\n\r\ntake  note? This is very important, as I will  explain\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of industrial health and safety cannot be\r\n\r\nmeasured merely on simple statistics on the number  of\r\n\r\ncases  and  the number of fatalities alone. There  are\r\n\r\nother  factors  which must be taken into consideration\r\n\r\nin  order  to obtain a proper assessment of  the  real\r\n\r\nsituation.  A  detailed  explanation  might   be   too\r\n\r\nacademic for the purposes of discussion in this House.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  think it would suffice  to  state  that\r\n\r\nother  factors,  such as the severity rate,  frequency\r\n\r\nrate,  number of man-hours worked, number  of  workers\r\n\r\nand so on, are all important considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The random quoting of statistics in the mass media\r\n\r\nappears  to have swayed the views of some hon. Members\r\n\r\nas   well   as  members  of  the  public;  hence   the\r\n\r\nobservation  that the state of industrial  health  and\r\n\r\nsafety  in  the Republic appears to have  got  out  of\r\n\r\nhand.  I have previously explained in this House  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a difference between the statistics  of  the\r\n\r\nworkmen's   compensation  figures  and   the   Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate  figures. Briefly, for working  purposes,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry defines \"industrial accidents\" as  those\r\n\r\nreportable   under  the  Factories  Act.   Take,   for\r\n\r\ninstance, the total number of fatalities in  the  last\r\n\r\nfew  years: 88 deaths in 1974, 67 in 1975  and  63  in\r\n\r\n1976. Members can see a gradual decline. These figures\r\n\r\nappear  to be roughly one-third, more or less, of  the\r\n\r\ntotal   fatalities   reported  under   the   Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation    Act   which   covers    non-industrial\r\n\r\nestablishments, that is to say, no licence is required\r\n\r\nor   the  need  to  report  in  accordance  with   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Factories Act. For this category.  I\r\n\r\nwill  broadly  classify  them as  \"other  occupational\r\n\r\naccidents\"   which  include  white  collar   or   non-industrial workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the definition is necessary and important\r\n\r\nbecause  very often the term \"industrial accident\"  or\r\n\r\n\"accident at work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nsite\" is used which, if left unclarified, might result\r\n\r\nin  the psychological resentment and resistance of our\r\n\r\nyoung  workers  in entering the industrial  sector  or\r\n\r\ntaking on blue collar jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Members for Anson and Sembawang have raised\r\n\r\ncertain  questions  regarding  industrial  safety  and\r\n\r\nhealth.  May  I  take the Member for Anson  first.  He\r\n\r\nasked what measures of safety have been introduced and\r\n\r\nimplied that my Ministry has been complacent in regard\r\n\r\nto  industrial  safety and health programmes.  In  his\r\n\r\nstatement   during  the  debate  on  the   President's\r\n\r\nAddress, my Minister has already informed the House of\r\n\r\nthe  measures  that my Ministry has taken  to  improve\r\n\r\nindustrial  safety and health. These measures  include\r\n\r\nthe setting up of safety and health standards, stepped-up   enforcement,   training  of   safety   personnel.\r\n\r\nsupervisors and workers and the promotion  of  greater\r\n\r\nsafety  and  health consciousness among employers  and\r\n\r\nworkers. As a result of these measures, there has been\r\n\r\nan  improvement in safety and health in our  shipyards\r\n\r\nand slight improvement in the construction work sites.\r\n\r\nThe Member for Anson may wish to refresh his memory by\r\n\r\nlooking up the Hansard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson referred to the accident at the\r\n\r\nSenoko  Power  Station.  I  believe  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nSembawang  also raised that point. A crane  which  was\r\n\r\nstuck  in  the  rut  overturned  while  it  was  being\r\n\r\nmanoeuvred into position. The accident occurred during\r\n\r\nsalvage    operations    to   upright    the    crane.\r\n\r\nInvestigations showed that the crane overturned  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of several factors. Firstly, the ground was  at\r\n\r\nan  incline and it was not suitable to bear the weight\r\n\r\nof  the  crane which was a heavy equipment.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nthe  boom  - I wonder whether the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nunderstands  what the boom of a crane is.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nhand  of the crane used for hoisting. The boom of  the\r\n\r\ncrane  was  raised  and opened up so  to  speak, thus\r\n\r\nadversely  affecting the stability of  the  crane.  To\r\n\r\nmake  it  worse, two mechanical shovels were  used  to\r\n\r\nfree  the  crane from the rut (rather stupid  I  would\r\n\r\nsay)  one pulling from the front and the other pushing\r\n\r\nfrom the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrear.  It was not a synchronised movement. There  were\r\n\r\ntwo  operators  working  on  two  separate  mechanical\r\n\r\nshovels,  one  pulling  and  the  other  pushing.  The\r\n\r\nmovement   was   not  synchronised,  power   was   not\r\n\r\nsynchronised, very unfortunate, and this  resulted  in\r\n\r\nthe crane overturning. There were some workers working\r\n\r\naround and the accident took place as described by the\r\n\r\ntwo   hon.  Members.  Sad  to  say,  Sir,  there   was\r\n\r\nsupervision  at  the  site by an  engineer.  Obviously\r\n\r\nthere  had been some error of judgment. I do not  wish\r\n\r\nto   comment  further  on  this  as  my  Ministry   is\r\n\r\ninvestigating  into  the  case  and  is  contemplating\r\n\r\ntaking appropriate action. So I think I should refrain\r\n\r\nfrom commenting further on this particular case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while industrial safety and health has improved\r\n\r\nin  the construction worksites and shipyards, I  agree\r\n\r\nwith the Member for Sembawang that there is still room\r\n\r\nfor   improvement,  especially  in  the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry. The number  of  fatalities  in\r\n\r\nworksites  dropped from 36 in 1975 to 32 in 1976,  but\r\n\r\nthe  number of minor accidents increased from  651  to\r\n\r\n698.  The Ministry will concentrate on two major types\r\n\r\nof  accidents, that is, workers falling  from  heights\r\n\r\nand  also workers struck by falling objects,  to  make\r\n\r\nconstruction worksites a safer place to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective of the proposed setting up of the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Occupational Safety and  Health  is  to\r\n\r\ncentralise   the  various  ad  hoc  arrangements   for\r\n\r\ntraining  of safety personnel. At the moment, training\r\n\r\nis  conducted by several agencies and it is  difficult\r\n\r\nto  maintain consistent standards due to the frequency\r\n\r\nof  the  courses as well as the change of instructors.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not to say that the standards are  low,  but\r\n\r\nthis arrangement is rather haphazard and unhealthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the present arrangement appears to meet the\r\n\r\nexisting requirements, it is considered inadequate  in\r\n\r\nthe  long run, taking into consideration the type  and\r\n\r\nthe   number   of  industries  with  more   and   more\r\n\r\nsophisticated machinery, the handling of raw materials\r\n\r\nwith  chemical  and other dangerous  content.  I  must\r\n\r\nassure the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSembawang   that  this  proposal  is  being   actively\r\n\r\npursued. An indicative five-year development  plan  is\r\n\r\nbeing  worked  out  and the matter will  be  taken  up\r\n\r\nshortly with the relevant authorities for approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must caution though at this stage that the\r\n\r\nInstitute must be realistic in its approach and should\r\n\r\nnot  take  on other responsibilities that may  not  be\r\n\r\nimmediately relevant to the industrial scene.  As  the\r\n\r\nInstitute gradually takes shape, other functions  such\r\n\r\nas  consultancy  and research can then  be  added,  if\r\n\r\ndeemed expedient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three safety and health exhibitions have been\r\n\r\norganised in the past. The first was in 1974  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry. The second  in  1975  for  the\r\n\r\nshipbuilding  and repair industry. And  the  third  in\r\n\r\n1976  for  the woodworking industry. These exhibitions\r\n\r\nhave  created  among employers and workers  a  greater\r\n\r\nawareness of industrial safety and health problems  in\r\n\r\ntheir  respective industries. These exhibitions  have,\r\n\r\ntherefore, in that sense assisted us in making work in\r\n\r\nthe industries more safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Members touched on the staffing of the Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate.  The Factory Inspectorate can  certainly\r\n\r\ndo  with more field officers. For the present level of\r\n\r\noperation,  the number of field officers  is  adequate\r\n\r\nwhen  stretched to the limit with back-up  systems  of\r\n\r\nsafety officers and safety committee down at the plant\r\n\r\nlevel.  The Factory Inspectorate continuously  reviews\r\n\r\nthe  methods of operation to streamline our inspection\r\n\r\nand  to  ensure  high quality of work and  also  wider\r\n\r\ncoverage.  Hon.  Members may have  observed  that  the\r\n\r\nFactory   Inspectorate  field   officers   have   been\r\n\r\nsignificantly augmented in the past years. In 1973 we\r\n\r\nhad a total of 36 field officers in the establishment,\r\n\r\nwhereas  there  are now a total of 55 in  the  current\r\n\r\nestablishment. The rate of increase in the field staff\r\n\r\nof  the  Inspectorate  compares  favourably  with  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the number of factories registered  with\r\n\r\nthe  Inspectorate. There were, 4,880 factories in 1973\r\n\r\nas  compared  to 5,747 (not 10,000 as the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  said earlier) by the end of 1976.  However.\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  will continuously review  the  staffing\r\n\r\nposition of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Inspectorate and will make requests for more staff\r\n\r\nas  and  when there is an increase in workload or  the\r\n\r\nlevel of operation is stepped up in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I just touch on two other points raised\r\n\r\nby the Members for Sembawang and Anson. The Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang  quoted  statistics  of  construction   site\r\n\r\naccidents. I have got the figures here. In  1976,  the\r\n\r\ntotal  number of accidents at all work sites  is  698,\r\n\r\nout  of  which 241 took place in Housing Board  sites,\r\n\r\nrepresenting  34.5%.  On the cases  of  fatalities  or\r\n\r\ndeath  cases, out of 32 death cases the Housing  Board\r\n\r\nsites took 21 or 65.6%. The Housing Board has now  got\r\n\r\nits  own  Safety Department with trained officers  and\r\n\r\nthey  are setting up their own enforcement and  safety\r\n\r\nstandards  at  their sites. I believe they  have  been\r\n\r\ndoing  good work, and I am informed that the  HDB  has\r\n\r\nalso  inaugurated  its  own  disincentive  scheme   by\r\n\r\nimposing penalties on their contractors who are  found\r\n\r\nto  have  flouted  safety rules. I believe  that  with\r\n\r\naction  on  the part of the Housing Board, the  safety\r\n\r\nstandards  in  HDB construction sites  will  certainly\r\n\r\nimprove in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of\r\n\r\nthe  detailed  reply given by the Senior Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by\r\n\r\nthe whole sum in respect of subhead AHA 1101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I fire the first salvo, Sir, at the Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate,  may  I  be permitted  to  give  them  a\r\n\r\nbouquet   where   the   shipbuilding   and   repairing\r\n\r\nindustries   in  Singapore  are  concerned.   Accident\r\n\r\nstatistics have dropped tremendously in this area, and\r\n\r\nI  believe that it is because of the good work of  the\r\n\r\nFactory  Inspectorate. But I must hasten to  add  that\r\n\r\nwithout  the  assistance of very able  personnel  from\r\n\r\noutside the Factory Inspectorate, such a record  might\r\n\r\nnot have been possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the building industry is concerned, I am\r\n\r\nafraid  that the Factory Inspectorate has  been  quite\r\n\r\nfast  asleep.  Accident statistics have been  hovering\r\n\r\nabove  600  and  shot  up last  year,  close  to  700.\r\n\r\nFatalities have been over the 30 mark - 34 in 1974, 34\r\n\r\nin  1975  and  32  in  1976.  I  believe  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate  has  not grasped  the  problems  in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding   construction  industry.  It  is   something\r\n\r\nintricate, something that they will need to go  deeper\r\n\r\ninto,  maybe seek help from outside as they have  done\r\n\r\nin   order  to  contain  the  accident  rate  in   the\r\n\r\nshipbuilding and repairing industry. I am hoping  that\r\n\r\nthe   hon.  Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour will be able to give  this  House\r\n\r\nsome   concrete  measures  planned  by   the   Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate to ensure that this condition will not be\r\n\r\nrepeated  when we meet again this time next  year  and\r\n\r\ndebate  as to whether the Factory Inspectorate  should\r\n\r\nreceive   the  sum  as  allocated  in  the  Main   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me touch on another point. While agreeing\r\n\r\nwith  the  Senior Parliamentary Secretary  for  Labour\r\n\r\nthat  knowledge  of accident statistics  alone  cannot\r\n\r\nalleviate  the accident incidence and severity  rates.\r\n\r\nstatistics will reflect the safety or otherwise of the\r\n\r\nworking  environment and enable Government,  employers\r\n\r\nand workers to put to use tripartitism that exists  in\r\n\r\nmost  working places towards ensuring a safer  working\r\n\r\nenvironment.  Whilst not wanting to be  too  technical\r\n\r\nfor  the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Labour.  I\r\n\r\nmust say that statistics is an important arm to assist\r\n\r\nin reducing the number of accidents in working places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past years the Ministry has produced monthly\r\n\r\nstatistics  which  are  made available  to  employers,\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  and workers, and any one interested  in\r\n\r\nseeing  accident  incidence rates dip.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry has decided to sweep the dust under  the\r\n\r\ncarpet,  so  to  speak.  It  stopped  issuing  monthly\r\n\r\nreports containing statistics. No, I am not asking for\r\n\r\nthe  American  National Standard  statistics  under  Z\r\n\r\n16.1. Gross statistics alone will be sufficient and it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  not  entail too many able-bodied  men  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour to work out these  statistics  so\r\n\r\nthat people like us and others, who are interested  in\r\n\r\nensuring  that  workers do not end up maimed  or  dead\r\n\r\nwill be able to come together and Sort out the problem\r\n\r\nthat  we  face either in the factories or in  building\r\n\r\nsites  to  ensure that accident incidence  rates  have\r\n\r\nactually   dipped.   I  feel  that  statutory   safety\r\n\r\ncommittees - it is a good thing it has been introduced\r\n\r\ninto   the  law  -  will  be  able  to  utilise  these\r\n\r\nstatistics  for the benefit of workers who  would  not\r\n\r\notherwise  have  been injured. Unless  they  know  the\r\n\r\nworking  environment, know the conditions that  exist.\r\n\r\nknow  the  hazards that exist and once  these  hazards\r\n\r\nhave  been spotted, they can control them and  prevent\r\n\r\ntheir recurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, the American\r\n\r\nStandard   Z  16.1  does  not  give  us  the  accident\r\n\r\nstatistics.  It  is  a  format  to  teach  us  how  to\r\n\r\ncalculate man-days lost. They call it ANSI Z 16.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I first deal with the Member's question on\r\n\r\nstatistics. The Member for Potong Pasir has queried on\r\n\r\nthe  reason  why  the Ministry has stopped  publishing\r\n\r\nthese  monthly reports. I presume the Member  is  more\r\n\r\ninterested  in  statistics on accidents alone  because\r\n\r\nthis  report also contained other information. I  wish\r\n\r\nto  say  that the Member appears to have been mistaken\r\n\r\nwhen  he  stated  that we have ceased  publication  of\r\n\r\nthese  statistics. The Ministry has decided to  change\r\n\r\nthe frequency of this publication from monthly to six-monthly. So if the Member could wait until June, I can\r\n\r\nassure him that a copy will be sent to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publication of the Monthly Report first started\r\n\r\nin  1955. Unfortunately, for the last two days I  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  able  to  uncover the thinking  behind  the\r\n\r\norigin  of this Monthly Report. This is rather an  odd\r\n\r\nprocedure.   No   other  Ministry  publishes   monthly\r\n\r\nreports.   In  view  of  the  shortage  of  supporting\r\n\r\nclerical staff, the Ministry has been considering  for\r\n\r\nsome  time  the  need  for  the  continuance  of   the\r\n\r\npublication of the monthly report, which involves  the\r\n\r\ncutting  of  stencils,  proof  reading,  printing  and\r\n\r\nbinding.   Senior  officers  are  also   involved   in\r\n\r\npreparing and vetting of the draft\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepartmental   reports  before  compiling   them   for\r\n\r\nproduction which, again, would mobilise a good  number\r\n\r\nof  officers  for a week or so. It is a  very  labour-intensive piece of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a need to keep a close tab on the\r\n\r\nsituation,  such  as  in the  case  of  the  two  most\r\n\r\naccident-prone  industries, the building  construction\r\n\r\nand  shipbuilding  and repairing  industries,  monthly\r\n\r\naccident statistics are compiled and submitted for the\r\n\r\ninformation of the two advisory committees  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry. These committees, with representatives  from\r\n\r\ninterested parties are established by the Ministry  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  ways and means of preventing accidents  in\r\n\r\nthese two industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir may be aware that there\r\n\r\nare  representatives from the unions, namely PIEU  and\r\n\r\nNTUC,  in these two committees. Nevertheless,  if  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Potong Pasir is interested to  have  NTUC\r\n\r\nrepresentatives on these committees  or  to  have  the\r\n\r\nstatistics, we would supply all the data to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Monthly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Well, if the Member is persistent,\r\n\r\nmonthly  it  will be, but only to him  or  any  other.\r\n\r\nMember  here who is interested. We find that it  would\r\n\r\nbe a useless exercise to publish these reports because\r\n\r\nonly about 1% of the people read them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I share the concern of the Member for\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir  regarding the safety situation  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.  As  stated  by  the  Minister\r\n\r\nduring  the  debate on the President's Address,  while\r\n\r\nthe   accident  frequency  and  severity  rates   have\r\n\r\nimproved,  the  safety situation in  the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry  needs  further  improvement.  I  assure  the\r\n\r\nMember  that we know what we are doing. We  have  been\r\n\r\nmonitoring  the  situation and  the  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber   of  accidents  is  mainly  due  to  a  better\r\n\r\nmonitoring system, as we have repeatedly said  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  There is a committee looking into this  problem\r\n\r\nwith  representatives from the Singapore Institute  of\r\n\r\nArchitects, the Singapore Institute of Surveyors,  the\r\n\r\nInstitute of Builders and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociation  of Consultant Engineers. The  Member  can\r\n\r\nsee  that  this committee is highly specialised.  They\r\n\r\nare  people  who  know exactly what they  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout.  There  is  no  question of  the  Ministry  not\r\n\r\nknowing how to handle the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one point which I wish to leave to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Potong  Pasir  to  think  about.  It   is\r\n\r\nextremely  difficult to convince the  contractors  and\r\n\r\ntheir workers because they are not that organised. The\r\n\r\nworkers  are  not unionised, so the NTUC cannot  reach\r\n\r\nthem.  With  the educational level of the contractors.\r\n\r\nfrom illiterate to semi-literate, it is very difficult\r\n\r\nto  deal  with them; unlike the shipbuilding  industry\r\n\r\nwhere we deal with more enlightened people. So this is\r\n\r\nthe  problem that will haunt us in the next few  years\r\n\r\nuntil  we  find  ways  and means, either  punitive  or\r\n\r\notherwise, to bring them in line with the thinking  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, from his answer the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary has grasped the problem, but I\r\n\r\nhope  that  he  can filter this down  to  his  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $9,783,950 for Head N ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $799,000 for Head N ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Q -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua (Boon Lay)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1004* (*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs.\r\n\r\nP. Govindaswamy. Teong Eng Siong, J. F. Conceicao, Ch'ng Jit Koon, Ho See Beng and Dr Ong Leong Boon).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on the President's Address in\r\n\r\nthis  House, the  Minister for Culture  made  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant announcement to this House, namely, that the\r\n\r\nGovernment intends to amend the Newspaper and Printing\r\n\r\nPresses  Act so that no one without approval would  be\r\n\r\nallowed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nown more than 3% of the shares of a newspaper company.\r\n\r\nThe  intention  of the Government is to  see  that  no\r\n\r\nnewspaper  is  being controlled by any  individual  or\r\n\r\nfamily.  This  amendment  will  greatly  affect  local\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  particularly  the  structure  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nNewspapers.  I  would  like the  Minister  to  further\r\n\r\nexplain,  if possible, the contents and the objectives\r\n\r\nof this amendment Bill. When the Bill is presented for\r\n\r\nSecond Reading. I will speak further on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Government is very concerned about\r\n\r\nthe  development of newspapers. This is a good  thing.\r\n\r\nWe all agree that a newspaper is a very important mass\r\n\r\nmedium  and it should not be made use of by a  handful\r\n\r\nof   people  working  against  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry. On the other hand, we must also remember that\r\n\r\nthe  newspaper  can  contribute  much  to  a  country.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Government's concern is more  from  the\r\n\r\nnegative angle rather than from the positive angle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a medium of communication, one of the important\r\n\r\nfunctions  of a newspaper is to disseminate  news  and\r\n\r\nviews. With regard to relations between the Government\r\n\r\nand  the  people,  it is a newspaper's  duty  also  to\r\n\r\npublish  Government  policies and  activities  and  to\r\n\r\nreflect  the views of the people. However, I must  say\r\n\r\nwith  regret  that  the Government  has  not  actively\r\n\r\nhelped newspapers to disseminate news. Two years' ago,\r\n\r\nwhen  debating  the  Budget  not  a  few  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  criticised the newspapers for the  paucity\r\n\r\nof  news  and  the low standard. Some  even  said  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers knew only to print the Ministers'  or  MPs'\r\n\r\nspeeches.  The low standard of newswriting is  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  low standard of language education. However, this\r\n\r\nis  not what we are discussing here. The main question\r\n\r\nis  whether  a  newspaper can offer a good  supply  of\r\n\r\nlively  and  significant  news  to  its  readers.  The\r\n\r\ndifficulty of newspaper reporters now is the  question\r\n\r\nof   getting   news   particularly   from   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  merely  treat the newspapers as  a  medium  for\r\n\r\npublicising   Ministerial  statements.  If   newspaper\r\n\r\nreporters  go  out  of  their way  to  get  news  from\r\n\r\nGovernment departments, they will invariably meet with\r\n\r\nobjection. We seem to have formed the habit  that  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  must  be high on top and  inaccessible  and\r\n\r\nthat  civil servants know only to carry out their work\r\n\r\naccording to rules and regulations and they  are  out-and-out  bureaucrats. All enquiries by  reporters  are\r\n\r\nmet  with  the  answer  \"No comment\".  Many  important\r\n\r\ndepartments  have got Public Relations Officers.  What\r\n\r\nare they doing? They only know how to write letters to\r\n\r\nthe  press  to answer readers' enquiries. To newspaper\r\n\r\nreporters' news enquiries, they either disregard  them\r\n\r\nor try to be' evasive or equivocal. In the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture, we do not even have a PRO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quote one example. Not long ago, the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education decided to abolish the automatic\r\n\r\npromotion  system. This is a very important  decision.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Ministry was extremely  embarrassed  in\r\n\r\nhaving  to  make such a decision. So much so  that  it\r\n\r\ntried   to   do  it  stealthily.  When  the  newspaper\r\n\r\nreporters came to know about this decision, they  made\r\n\r\nenquiries  at  the  Education Ministry.  However,  the\r\n\r\nofficials  in  the Ministry tried to be equivocal  and\r\n\r\ngave  two versions to two different newspapers causing\r\n\r\nunnecessary  confusion. In the end, people  interested\r\n\r\nin education suffered and not the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that newspapers are owned privately and they\r\n\r\nare  not  under the direct control of the  Government.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the Ministry of Culture has a duty  to  help\r\n\r\njournalists in their work, which will also benefit the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The PRO in every department  should  have\r\n\r\nsomething more practical and meaningful to do and  not\r\n\r\njust   to  write  letters.  Some  years  ago, various\r\n\r\nministries  used  to  have \"meet-the-press\"  sessions.\r\n\r\nNow,  there seems to be none. I remember when I was  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper reporter, the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development who was  also  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the  Urban and Rural Services  Committee\r\n\r\nused to have this kind of meet-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe-press  sessions  regularly,  when  the  whole   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  knew about the URSC activities.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  why he does not have any more of these meet-the-press  sessions. Is it because he has nothing more  to\r\n\r\nsay or has somebody not allowed him to speak?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a country like ours, Government activities\r\n\r\nare   one  of  the  main  sources  of  news  for   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  If the Government were to  cut  off  such\r\n\r\nsource  of  news, it would not do  any  good  to  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  as well as to the Government. I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture will take the initiative to  solve\r\n\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the news handled by\r\n\r\nTelevision Singapore. By \"news\" I mean there are  news\r\n\r\nitems  and views. In this regard, the Chinese  section\r\n\r\nis  doing  better  than the English  section.  In  the\r\n\r\nChinese  section, there is the programme called  \"News\r\n\r\nMagazine\"  which  is  quite successful.  However,  the\r\n\r\nEnglish section does not have such a programme. It has\r\n\r\nmore  programmes  on entertainment than  on  news  and\r\n\r\neducation.  RTS has very little time for  daily  news.\r\n\r\nAlthough  there are two English news bulletins,  there\r\n\r\nis  only one news bulletin each for the Chinese, Tamil\r\n\r\nand  Malay sections. The news broadcasts in  the  four\r\n\r\nlanguages  could not include late news, such  as  MPs\r\n\r\nspeeches  as at 7 p.m. here. The Chinese Section  does\r\n\r\nnot  include  it in the news telecast. I suggest  that\r\n\r\nboth Channel 5 and Channel 8 should broadcast the late\r\n\r\nnews  briefly  in  all  the four  languages,  English,\r\n\r\nChinese. Malay and Tamil, before closing time. RTS  is\r\n\r\nGovernment-owned and operated, therefore it should  be\r\n\r\na  means  to  educate and to entertain our people.  In\r\n\r\nHong  Kong, the television station is privately owned,\r\n\r\nyet their news broadcasting time is more than ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I want to talk about the news readers. We must\r\n\r\nbe careful in the selection of news readers. If a news\r\n\r\nreader  appears  too often on television  and  becomes\r\n\r\nwell  known, then if he suddenly becomes an opposition\r\n\r\ncandidate, it will be very embarrassing to all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof us. I believe the Member for Serangoon Gardens will\r\n\r\nagree  with  me. Therefore, I suggest RTS  should  not\r\n\r\nengage any more guest news readers in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture seems to be obsessed with the formation  of  a\r\n\r\nWestern  style symphony orchestra. May I ask: is  this\r\n\r\nsymphony  orchestra really necessary? We should  first\r\n\r\nand  foremost  develop our own Asian  music,  art  and\r\n\r\nliterature  and not be inclined towards the  West  for\r\n\r\nour cultural development. It seems that very little is\r\n\r\nbeing   done  by  the  Ministry  of  Culture  in   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Asian art, music, dance and literature.\r\n\r\nAnd what little development there is, is the result of\r\n\r\nthe  initiative  and  interest of a  few  hard-working\r\n\r\npeople who had to struggle against great odds in  both\r\n\r\nfinancial and material matters. Should we not  develop\r\n\r\ngood  Chinese, Indian and Malay music and painting  in\r\n\r\nkeeping with an Asian concept?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the Ministry of Culture doing to\r\n\r\nencourage Art among our youngsters? The Young People's\r\n\r\nGallery  has  become a museum piece of late.  The  few\r\n\r\noutdoor exhibitions were so poorly patronised that  it\r\n\r\nis  high time the Ministry of Culture did something to\r\n\r\ncoordinate its efforts with the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nCredit  can be given to the Ministry of Education  for\r\n\r\ntaking the initiative to open a sales centre at  Hotel\r\n\r\nPremier. This is really commendable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have in the past been talking so much about\r\n\r\nthe  concept  of  a Singapore culture of  our  various\r\n\r\nraces.  What efforts are being made in this direction?\r\n\r\nThere seems to be very little motivation and drive  in\r\n\r\nthis effort. We do not seem to get many programmes  on\r\n\r\nthe Singapore culture. Even the National Theatre Trust\r\n\r\nof late does not seem to be in the limelight. What has\r\n\r\nhappened  to the Trust in its promotion of a Singapore\r\n\r\nculture?  I  feel  that  more  quality  programmes  on\r\n\r\nSingapore  culture  should  be  organised  at  various\r\n\r\nlevels  and distributed locally and abroad so that  we\r\n\r\ncan  be  culturally identified by others in  a  better\r\n\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, every year\r\n\r\nwhen  Parliament meets to discuss matters relating  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Culture, the subject of  culture  has\r\n\r\nalways  been  a  very  hot  topic.  This  shows   that\r\n\r\neverybody  is very interested in culture and  it  also\r\n\r\nshows  that  everybody  is  very  concerned  with  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our culture and art. Of course, culture\r\n\r\nand  art  is very important to the nation  and  it  is\r\n\r\nparticularly important to the spiritual  life  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  If  we  do not have sufficient cultural  food\r\n\r\nthen the life of our people will become lonely, devoid\r\n\r\nof  spiritual  and cultural content. We will  be  like\r\n\r\npeople living in the desert. Since culture and art  is\r\n\r\nso  important  to  the cultural life  of  our  people,\r\n\r\ntherefore we must regard the promotion of culture  and\r\n\r\nart  as a pressing need and an immediate task to bring\r\n\r\nour people to the oasis of their cultural life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since our independence, cultural and artistic\r\n\r\nactivities   in  our  country  have  never   been   as\r\n\r\nprogressive or active as our economic progress.  There\r\n\r\nare  several reasons which I would like to  enumerate.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  Ministry  of Culture  has  not  fixed  or\r\n\r\nformulated  any  definite objective in  the  field  of\r\n\r\npromotion of culture and art. Although the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture  has stressed that it intended to promote  the\r\n\r\ncultural  and artistic heritage of the various  ethnic\r\n\r\ncommunities  in  the country, no concrete  steps  have\r\n\r\nbeen taken to effect such a decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Ministry of Culture is lacking in\r\n\r\nexperienced  artistes. The Minister admitted  this  on\r\n\r\nthe  15th  of  this month in this House. What  is  the\r\n\r\nreason  for the shortage of experienced artistes?  The\r\n\r\nmain  reason is that the pay is too little. We  expect\r\n\r\npeople to give more value than they are paid for. This\r\n\r\nis  not  the  way  to  raise  our  cultural  standard.\r\n\r\nObviously, at present it is not possible to  get  such\r\n\r\ndedicated  talents.  The  Ministry  should  give  more\r\n\r\nreasonable  awards, in order to get good talent.  This\r\n\r\nis  a prerequisite to the promotion and the raising of\r\n\r\nthe standard of culture and art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Main Estimates of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture, the allocation for the financial year amounts\r\n\r\nto $47.7 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhereas  for the Development Estimates the  allocation\r\n\r\nis $10.4 million. There is a decrease of $3 million in\r\n\r\ndevelopment  allocation. Would it affect the  cultural\r\n\r\nand  artistic development? I remember the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong  raised this question in this House  two  years\r\n\r\nago,  and  the  reply  by the Minister  was  that  the\r\n\r\nsolution  to the question of culture and art  did  not\r\n\r\ndepend  on  any  amount of money and culture  and  art\r\n\r\nneeded nurturing over a long period. It is, of course,\r\n\r\ntrue  to say that the amount of money spent on culture\r\n\r\nis  not  the criterion to the standard of culture  and\r\n\r\nart. Nevertheless it is one of the necessary boosters.\r\n\r\nIt  is  all very well to say so, but if people engaged\r\n\r\nin cultural and artistic activities are not reasonably\r\n\r\npaid,   how   can  we  expect  them   to   give   good\r\n\r\nperformances?  This  situation  has  taken  place   in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  TV  programmes. For instance,  for  a  TV\r\n\r\nscript the payment is $99, whereas the producer  would\r\n\r\nget  $50. [Interruption]. This is too little. How can\r\n\r\nwe  expect to get a good standard of programmes?  This\r\n\r\nis  the reality of things. When we talk of \"from  each\r\n\r\nhis best, and to each his worth\", in the field of art,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in respect of the RTS and its  artistes,\r\n\r\nthey  should  also  have  their remunerations  raised.\r\n\r\nOtherwise  how  can we expect them to  produce  better\r\n\r\nquality stuff for our TV and Radio programmes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should open up more training classes for\r\n\r\nour new artistes. On 23rd February, in this House, the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  reply to my question said that  at  that\r\n\r\nmoment there were already courses for the training  of\r\n\r\nlocal artistes. One was meant for adults and the other\r\n\r\nfor  children. Of course, this is a very good plan.  I\r\n\r\nhope good results will be achieved so that in the  not\r\n\r\ntoo distant future we will be able to see better local\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we should encourage civic and artistic\r\n\r\norganisations  in our community to  take  part  in  TV\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  The  President has  pointed  out  in  his\r\n\r\nAddress   that  we  should  develop  our   traditional\r\n\r\ncultures  and  arts. If that is so,  we  must  try  to\r\n\r\nformulate  plans to effect this. We could  investigate\r\n\r\nhow many artistes are available. There could be many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelites who are capable in this field whom we have  not\r\n\r\ndiscovered.  We should organise them and make  use  of\r\n\r\nthem  so  that they can contribute their best  towards\r\n\r\nthe development of culture and art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as regards cultural and artistic\r\n\r\norganisations in our community, we should  allow  them\r\n\r\nmore  time and opportunity to perform for TV and radio\r\n\r\nso  as to encourage the promotion of local talents  in\r\n\r\nculture  and  art. There is another question  I  would\r\n\r\nalso  like to ask the Minister and that is whether  he\r\n\r\nwould   consider  filming  newsreels  on   our   local\r\n\r\nactivities  reporting on the various  aspects  of  our\r\n\r\nlife  and  progress so that our people can  understand\r\n\r\nour own situation and progress better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Science and Technology (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I  be  permitted  to reply  to  the  first  three\r\n\r\nspeakers before the other Members speak?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, during the debate on the\r\n\r\nPresident's Address I have laid down the policy on the\r\n\r\nrestriction  of  ownership  of  newspaper   companies'\r\n\r\nshares. I have stated the principle, the objective and\r\n\r\nthe  reasons for such action. There is really  nothing\r\n\r\nmore for me to add now. As regards the details and how\r\n\r\nthey  are  to be implemented, I think it  is  best  to\r\n\r\nleave  it  to  the  legal draftsman. We  have  already\r\n\r\ninstructed them to work out an amendment based on  the\r\n\r\nprinciples laid down in the policy speech.  This  will\r\n\r\nbe presented to the House in due course, and I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  Member will be able to read all about it when  it\r\n\r\ncomes up for the First and Second Readings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding public relations officers and the\r\n\r\nspokesmen  for  the various Ministries.  I  share  the\r\n\r\nsympathy  which the Member for Boon Lay  has  for  his\r\n\r\nfellow  journalists about their difficulty in  getting\r\n\r\ninformation  from  the  public relations  officers  in\r\n\r\nGovernment Ministries and departments. This is nothing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew.  He  may wish to know that even our RTS reporters\r\n\r\nhave experienced the same difficulty. Unfortunately my\r\n\r\nMinistry has no control whatsoever over this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Publicity Division of my Ministry receives\r\n\r\nthrough  its Press Section policy speeches  and  press\r\n\r\nstatements  issued by Ministries and  departments  for\r\n\r\nrelease  to the press. It also helps to arrange  press\r\n\r\nconferences  for them. For instance,  the  one  by  G.\r\n\r\nRaman  and  Arun  Senkuttuvan  was  arranged  by  this\r\n\r\nsection.  However,  the Publicity Division  is  in  no\r\n\r\nposition  to obtain information for reporters  if  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  concerned  is  reluctant  to  release   such\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a tug of war between the journalists\r\n\r\nand  Government officials. On the one hand, it is  the\r\n\r\nduty   of   Government  officials  to  see   that   no\r\n\r\ninformation of a sensitive nature should fall into the\r\n\r\nhands  of  unauthorised persons. If there is any  news\r\n\r\nstory  at  all,  it would be issued by the  department\r\n\r\nconcerned.  They  will wait until the  most  opportune\r\n\r\ntime  to issue it, in which case every journalist will\r\n\r\nget a copy of the statement. On the other hand, it  is\r\n\r\nthe  duty  of  a journalist to dig out any information\r\n\r\nthere  is  from a Government department, so as  to  be\r\n\r\nahead  of  his rival journalists. So there  is  always\r\n\r\nthis  conflict  of duty and interest.  The  Government\r\n\r\nofficial is in a dilemma. If he leaks out a story,  he\r\n\r\nis  in  trouble, he will lose his job. If he  releases\r\n\r\nthe  story and it does not get good coverage from  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, he is also in trouble and  he  will  also\r\n\r\nlose  his job. So there is a constant battle  of  wits\r\n\r\nand  manoeuvring skill between the two. I do not think\r\n\r\nthe  journalists should expect us to fight the  battle\r\n\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is fair to blame the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture for the low standard of the newspapers. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  true  to say that Ministers are sitting  in  high\r\n\r\nplaces  and ignore the people from the low -  gao  gao\r\n\r\nzai  shang (). This is not true. Being  elected\r\n\r\nMPs  and elected Ministers, we meet the people all the\r\n\r\ntime.  In fact, we create the opportunity to meet  the\r\n\r\npeople. We canvas,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  go  round, and we meet the lowest of the low.  The\r\n\r\nway  the  criticism was directed at us is very unfair.\r\n\r\nBut  if  the newspaper boys want to see the  Ministers\r\n\r\nevery now and then in order to confirm or deny a story\r\n\r\nor  even to create a story for them, then I think  the\r\n\r\nMinisters are wrongly paid. They should not  be  doing\r\n\r\nthat. It is not their job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The production of News Magazine in English had to be\r\n\r\nsuspended in August 1974 owing to a serious  shortage\r\n\r\nof  staff in the English News Editing Unit. Of the  12\r\n\r\nposts  of  News editors and sub-editors in  the  Unit,\r\n\r\nonly  eight were filled at that time. Since  then  the\r\n\r\nposition has not improved. Production of News Magazine\r\n\r\nin English will be resumed when the English Unit has a\r\n\r\nfull complement of staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member for. Boon Lay that\r\n\r\nall  the  candidates selected for permanent and  part-time  appointments in the Department  of  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nare  security-screened before assuming duty.  Although\r\n\r\nthey  are  all  right when we employ them,  we  cannot\r\n\r\nguarantee  that they will not do foolish things  later\r\n\r\non.  Mr  Harry  Crabb is one of them. Mr  Harry  Crabb\r\n\r\njoined  the Department of Broadcasting in  1960  as  a\r\n\r\ntemporary Broadcasting Assistant, and was promoted  to\r\n\r\nProgramme  Assistant  in 1964. He  resigned  from  the\r\n\r\nservice  in 1971. Later, he was re-engaged as a  part-time  newsreader until July last year. I may add  that\r\n\r\ngood news readers are not easily found. So RTS has  to\r\n\r\nengage  part-time  news  readers.  News  readers  will\r\n\r\ninvariably become familiar to households over a period\r\n\r\nof   time.  However,  familiarity  is  different  from\r\n\r\nacceptability.  The  fact  that  Mr  Crabb  lost   the\r\n\r\nelections,  notwithstanding his familiar  face,  shows\r\n\r\nthat he is not acceptable to the voters. Otherwise Pte\r\n\r\nLau Teik Soon, the Member for Serangoon Gardens, would\r\n\r\nnot  be  here.  I  think the people of  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nsophisticated  enough  not to go  for  familiarity  or\r\n\r\npopularity  of candidates, but to examine the  records\r\n\r\nand  achievements of a party before  they  cast  their\r\n\r\nvotes.  I  am,  therefore, not in  the  least  worried\r\n\r\nwhether  members of the opposition party are  familiar\r\n\r\nfaces. Indeed, familiarity without substance may  even\r\n\r\nbreed contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson seems to be very impatient in\r\n\r\nseeing  a  Singapore culture coming  into  being  and,\r\n\r\nindeed, I would be if I were his age. But this  matter\r\n\r\ntakes time. It may take years or even generations  for\r\n\r\nit to take form. There is no way we can hasten it. Mao\r\n\r\nTse-tung  tried to do it when he started the  cultural\r\n\r\nrevolution.  But  look at what happened  to  him.  His\r\n\r\nwidow was discredited and the Cultural Revolution  has\r\n\r\nfallen  into disrepute. There is no culture and  there\r\n\r\nis no revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Singapore it is the policy of the Government\r\n\r\nto  preserve the inherited Chinese, Indian, Malay  and\r\n\r\nWestern  cultures  and  to  give  them  the  necessary\r\n\r\nencouragement for their harmonious development into an\r\n\r\nidentifiable culture of our own. We favour  no  single\r\n\r\nculture but allow the blooming and interaction of  all\r\n\r\nour   inherited   cultures  so   that   eventually   a\r\n\r\ndistinctive Singapore culture will emerge. We  want  a\r\n\r\nhundred  flowers to bloom and our only regret is  that\r\n\r\nthere are not so many flowers around. For him or  even\r\n\r\nfor  me,  it may be a bit slow. We may not be able  to\r\n\r\nsee  the  full bloom of its glory. But if  we  do  the\r\n\r\nright things now, those who come after us will be able\r\n\r\nto  enjoy  the  benefits.  As  the  saying  goes,  the\r\n\r\nforefathers planted the tree, the children  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nshade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not obsessed with the idea of forming a\r\n\r\nWestern style symphony orchestra. If there are  enough\r\n\r\ntalents and musicians to form one and if it is  within\r\n\r\nour budget to do so, we will form one. If not, we will\r\n\r\nlet  things  lie.  There  is no  hurry.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nadvantage in forcing something down the throats of the\r\n\r\npeople  if  they  are not ready for  it.  But  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime  we  have a Chinese orchestra formed  by  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association Chinese orchestra, of  which  we\r\n\r\nare proud as it enjoys a large following.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of ASEAN art, music, dance and\r\n\r\nliterature. I agree that steps should be taken for  us\r\n\r\nto  learn and appreciate more of the cultures  of  our\r\n\r\nASEAN  partners. It must be remembered, however,  that\r\n\r\nASEAN  is only ten years old. But despite this,  there\r\n\r\nhave been frequent visits of artistes, painters,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphotographers   from  member-countries.   Steps   have\r\n\r\nalready  been taken at official levels,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  mobile  art  and photographic  exhibition,  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  exchange  of  radio  and  television  artistes.\r\n\r\nexchange of radio and television programmes, the ASEAN\r\n\r\nfilm festival and the ASEAN literary award, to promote\r\n\r\nan  awareness of the rich cultural diversities as well\r\n\r\nas similarities of member-countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incorrect for the Member to say that the Young\r\n\r\nPeople's Gallery has become a museum piece. From April\r\n\r\nlast  year to February this year seven exhibitions  of\r\n\r\nstudents'  work were organised, and these  exhibitions\r\n\r\nattracted over 100,000 visitors. The hon. Member  may\r\n\r\nbe  interested to know that for the rest of this  year\r\n\r\nanother six exhibitions are being planned. Besides the\r\n\r\nYoung  People's Gallery, the exhibitions held  in  the\r\n\r\nNational  Museum  Art  Gallery and  the  other  public\r\n\r\ngalleries continue to attract large numbers  of  young\r\n\r\nvisitors.  My  own Ministry's open air art  exhibition\r\n\r\nfor   the   young   held   quarterly   also   provides\r\n\r\nopportunities for our young budding artists. More than\r\n\r\n2,000   young  artists  have  participated  in   these\r\n\r\nexhibitions.  The on-the-spot drawing exhibition  held\r\n\r\nin   the   Zoological  Garden  was  also  a   success,\r\n\r\nattracting  more  than 2,000 young  participants.  The\r\n\r\nNational  Theatre  Trust together  with  the  National\r\n\r\nTheatre  Club  has  been  promoting  various  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities.   Besides  maintaining  a  permanent   art\r\n\r\ngallery  at the Theatre's foyer, the National  Theatre\r\n\r\nTrust  organises song writing competitions,  open  air\r\n\r\nconcerts and classes on music and dances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress again that the evolution of a\r\n\r\nSingapore   culture  is  a  long  and   time-consuming\r\n\r\nprocess.  We can encourage it but we cannot direct  it\r\n\r\nin the same way that we direct economic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has said that we lack\r\n\r\nartistes.  Yes, we do lack artistes because there  are\r\n\r\nvery  few  people in Singapore. So we  have  very  few\r\n\r\nartistes  here.  We  do  not  have  a  large  base  of\r\n\r\npopulation from which to tap our talents. But  in  any\r\n\r\ncase,  if there are talents from other places, we  are\r\n\r\nvery glad to accept them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Taiwan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> They are not artistes. We do not\r\n\r\nconsider them as artistes. They are entertainers. They\r\n\r\ncome and go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding training of the staff, we do have training\r\n\r\nfor the artistes in the television and radio services,\r\n\r\nbut  we  must  bear  in mind that  training  is  being\r\n\r\nundertaken  by  full-time staff  in  the  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDepartment  who, apart from their normal duties,  have\r\n\r\nto  undergo this training. The training of artistes is\r\n\r\na  very  time-consuming process. I do agree  with  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang that fees for artistic  services\r\n\r\nrendered  on  our radio and television  are  low  when\r\n\r\ncompared with other stations. But we have taken  steps\r\n\r\nto revise the scales of payment and to improve certain\r\n\r\nrates. But whatever improvements that are going to  be\r\n\r\nmade   will  have  to  relate  to  the  annual  budget\r\n\r\nallocation for such fees; in some cases to the  salary\r\n\r\nscales of permanent staff carrying out similar duties.\r\n\r\nThere  is  provision for payment of up to $149  for  a\r\n\r\ngood  30 minutes of a TV drama script and $500 for  an\r\n\r\noutstanding  one. The crux of the matter is  that  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  the  script submitted  does  not  justify\r\n\r\npayment in excess of the $99 mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the development of traditional cultures, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure the Member that radio  services  have\r\n\r\nprovided     ample    opportunities    for    cultural\r\n\r\norganisations  to  perform in their  programmes.  Even\r\n\r\nwith  a  predominantly local nature of its production,\r\n\r\nour  radio services rely very heavily on local talent.\r\n\r\nThey  are also given opportunities to perform  on  TV.\r\n\r\nFrom  1975 up to the present, there were 18 series  of\r\n\r\ncultural programmes produced on television using local\r\n\r\ntalent,  and  no  less than 19 cultural  organisations\r\n\r\ndrawn from the four language streams were featured  in\r\n\r\nthe RTS programmes last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the RTS staff doing their own talent\r\n\r\nscouting,  organisations are welcome to  write  in  if\r\n\r\nthey  think they can contribute to radio or television\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and  those found suitable  after  audition\r\n\r\nwill be given opportunities to perform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also suggested that we\r\n\r\nshould  resume our old practice of producing films  or\r\n\r\nnewsreels  for screening in cinemas. When we  produced\r\n\r\nnewsreels  in  those  days,  TV  had  not   yet   been\r\n\r\nintroduced  and  the cinema then was the  only  visual\r\n\r\nmedium  within  the reach of the general  public.  But\r\n\r\nsince  then, TV newsreel has made the cinema  newsreel\r\n\r\nobsolete. What happens in the morning can be  seen  on\r\n\r\nTV  in  the  evening. Since TV newsreel is  much  more\r\n\r\neffective  than cinema newsreel, it seems a  waste  of\r\n\r\nmoney to continue producing newsreel for the cinemas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

After how many years can we form a Singapore\r\n\r\nculture? I urge the Minister to be quick about\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, two\r\n\r\nareas  where it has been feasible to stress  practical\r\n\r\ncultural development has been the area of visual  arts\r\n\r\nand  music.  With the reorganisation of  the  National\r\n\r\nMuseum and the establishment of the Art Gallery there,\r\n\r\nencouragement for the development of the  visual  arts\r\n\r\nhas  for  the  time being risen to  a  fair  level  of\r\n\r\nsatisfaction.   The   Minister  has   indicated   with\r\n\r\nstatistics that this has been so and he has  described\r\n\r\nand  I agree with him the extent of the activities  in\r\n\r\nthe  sphere of development of appreciation of the arts\r\n\r\nand activity in the visual arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to stress the ordered development of a\r\n\r\nmusic  policy  for Singapore. Sir, I speak  along  the\r\n\r\nlines  of  what  I am familiar with and  that  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  music derived from the West, but I would  not\r\n\r\nlike  in  any  way to exclude music that has  our  own\r\n\r\nlocal and indigenous origin. The ground seems fruitful\r\n\r\nfor  music  development. To serve as a  base  we  have\r\n\r\nquite  a number of musical activities organised  by  a\r\n\r\nfairly large\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber of bodies including the Ministry of Culture and\r\n\r\nits  divisions, such as the National Theatre Trust and\r\n\r\nthe  RTS,  the Ministry of Education's ECA  unit,  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Education, the University of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nas  well  as private musical organisations. Orchestras\r\n\r\nin  sporadic  operations include the  Singapore  Youth\r\n\r\nOrchestra,   the  Singapore  Schools  Orchestra,   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Singapore and, of course, the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  Orchestra  that the  Minister  mentioned.\r\n\r\nMusic  making  is quite a widespread activity  and  it\r\n\r\nseems  to  me that when the Minister spoke  about  the\r\n\r\navailability of appropriate numbers, perhaps if  stock\r\n\r\nis taken we will find that we have reached a situation\r\n\r\nwhere  there are appropriate numbers. But activity  in\r\n\r\nthe   music  area  seems  to  lack  overall   national\r\n\r\ndirection. This is perhaps because there has not  been\r\n\r\npreviously  an adequate articulation of a  policy  for\r\n\r\nmusic.  In  fact,  there  has  not  been  an  adequate\r\n\r\narticulation of a policy for culture until perhaps the\r\n\r\nlast year or so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Until the Member for Katong's\r\n\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I am glad that the Minister has taken\r\n\r\nnote  of  what we have suggested, not only the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Katong but other Members too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think such a policy should aim at\r\n\r\ninvolving as many people as possible especially  young\r\n\r\npeople  in the various forms of music making  such  as\r\n\r\nperforming  in  orchestras,  small  ensembles,  bands,\r\n\r\nchoirs,  and here of course, in relation to  Asian  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  other forms of music. Secondly,  the  policy\r\n\r\nshould aim at raising the level of music participation\r\n\r\nand performances so that, thirdly, this may contribute\r\n\r\nto  the  establishment of national  performing  bodies\r\n\r\nlike  the  National Choral Society or even a  national\r\n\r\nsymphony  orchestra.  The development  of  a  national\r\n\r\nsymphony  orchestra  is  without  prejudice   to   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Asian instrumental groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moves towards the establishment of a symphony\r\n\r\norchestra  have  been  aborted because  of  cost.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  has talked about cost two years ago  and  he\r\n\r\nstill keeps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalking   about  cost.  However,  it  is   with   some\r\n\r\nimagination  still  possible to establish  a  national\r\n\r\norchestra, on an economic basis of a core of full-time\r\n\r\nprofessionals  plus  others  consisting  of  part-time\r\n\r\nmusicians.  This is not an original idea. In  fact.  I\r\n\r\ngot this idea from the Ministry of Culture itself. The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture  has been thinking  along  these\r\n\r\ntines and I am sure the Minister is aware of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture has my sympathy in  his  uphill\r\n\r\nstruggle   to  get  financial  support  for   cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  this  kind  but  still  the  onus  is\r\n\r\ndefintely  on  his shoulders. He is the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture. The onus is defintely on his shoulders, and I\r\n\r\nwould urge him to use his powers of persuasion to  get\r\n\r\nsupport from his Cabinet colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I  recognise   the\r\n\r\nimpracticability of asking presently for a new concert\r\n\r\nhail.  This  is  completely out of  the  question,  of\r\n\r\ncourse. But we should look into the possibility and  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  feasible of restructuring the  Victoria\r\n\r\nMemorial Hall despite the fact that that was the venue\r\n\r\nfor  the  foundation of the Party, for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nserving  as  a  concert hall. I believe  the  acoustic\r\n\r\npossibilities for orchestral presentation are good and\r\n\r\nsuch   a   provision   would   give   focus   to   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of a music policy. I am not asking that\r\n\r\nall  this should be done overnight although the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson has sounded a note of urgency. [Interruption].\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Anson  should\r\n\r\nnot  listen  to  the agitation that is  going  on  his\r\n\r\nright.

Sir, writings  such  as\r\n\r\nthese run counter to our national policy because:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) they create confrontation between employers and\r\n\r\nemployees, between the rich and the poor;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the occasioning of employer/employee\r\n\r\nconfrontation gives rise to the communist  concept  of\r\n\r\nclass conflict in their anti-Government subversion;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the presence of the concept of class conflict\r\n\r\ngenerates    hostility   between   employers    and\r\n\r\nemployees and between the poor and the rich;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) consciousness of hostilities affects our\r\n\r\ninternal  security and deals an instant  blow  to  our\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instability at home will weaken Government's control,\r\n\r\ncause  industrial unrest and result in investment  and\r\n\r\nproductivity  sliding downhill. Sir,  if  we  fail  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  the  foundation of a stable  government,  if\r\n\r\ninvestments  do  not  come  forward  and  productivity\r\n\r\nremains  stagnant, our economic growth will slow  down\r\n\r\nimmediately. Our two million people will then  lose  a\r\n\r\nfirm hold on their means of livelihood. This situation\r\n\r\nwill then afford a good opportunity for the communists\r\n\r\nto  seize  power and enslave our people. Our  national\r\n\r\npolicy admits of no class conscious communist ideology\r\n\r\nto  use  our  newspapers to poison our youths  because\r\n\r\nthis would jeopardise the security of our country  and\r\n\r\nthe  survival  of our people.

Apart from issuing publication\r\n\r\npermits  to  the  newspapers,  does  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture ignore this kind of writing or does it prevail\r\n\r\nupon  the editors to refuse to publish any more  these\r\n\r\nclass-conscious      writings     about      so-called\r\n\r\n\"employer/employee\"  and  \"rich/poor\"   confrontation?\r\n\r\nBesides,  our Ministry of Labour accepts the  workers'\r\n\r\ncomplaints  against the employers. There is absolutely\r\n\r\nno  oppression by employers to speak on.  As  for  the\r\n\r\npoor  having  no money to seek medical  treatment  and\r\n\r\nhaving to wait for their death, this statement is even\r\n\r\nmore absurd. The General Hospital gives free treatment\r\n\r\nto  patients who are genuinely penniless and to  those\r\n\r\nreceiving  public  assistance.  Our  workers'   living\r\n\r\nstandard   here  cannot  match  with  that  of   their\r\n\r\ncounterparts  in  the United States. But  compared  to\r\n\r\nthose in China, they are living in paradise here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I rise to raise a small\r\n\r\nissue.  This  regards  the issue  of  permits  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture for staging wayang shows,  puppet\r\n\r\nshows, sing-song sessions, etc, for festivities.  This\r\n\r\nis  particularly  relevant  during  the  Seventh  Moon\r\n\r\nFestival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the necessity for the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nto regulate these festivities by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequiring them to have a permit issued for staging the\r\n\r\nshow,  and the attendant problems of traffic flow  and\r\n\r\nnoise pollution. We are familiar with the problems  of\r\n\r\nthe applicant who has to go through a number of stages\r\n\r\nbefore  he  could  finally  have  a  wayang  show   to\r\n\r\ncommemorate Tua Pek Kong's birthday. We know that  the\r\n\r\napplicant  has  to  go  and see his  local  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament  for recommendation. For one, I cannot  see\r\n\r\nwhat relevance the Member of Parliament has got to  do\r\n\r\nwith Tua Pek Kong's or Kwan In's birthday. I find this\r\n\r\nquite perplexing. In the course of one year, I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  Member  of  Parliament would have  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nsomething  like  20  to  30 applications.  Hence, the\r\n\r\nnecessary  recommendation. Members of  Parliament  too\r\n\r\nare required to say, \"No\" or \"Yes\", Quite honestly,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know what guidelines there are for me to  say\r\n\r\n\"No\". I adopt the policy of saying \"Yes\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area where the applicant has to go\r\n\r\nthrough  is  the  Housing and Development  Board  Area\r\n\r\nOffice,  where I am told the Area Officer is  supplied\r\n\r\nwith a very well documented list of approved sites for\r\n\r\nstaging of these shows. Very often we know that  these\r\n\r\napproved  sites are not necessarily the most  suitable\r\n\r\nsites for staging these shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, he has to run along to see the traffic\r\n\r\npolice  officer.  Eventually having gone  through  all\r\n\r\nthese  obstacles,  he  turns up  at  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture for the permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is, the list of approved sites has been\r\n\r\ndrawn  up  by the Ministry of Culture. To my knowledge\r\n\r\nthere  was no prior consultation with the local Member\r\n\r\nof  Parliament. It is obvious that some of these sites\r\n\r\nwere  just  convenient sites, convenient to  the  Area\r\n\r\nOfficer,  convenient  to  some  planners  but  without\r\n\r\nhaving a realistic understanding of the needs of these\r\n\r\nvarious  temples or their followers. HDB Area Officers\r\n\r\ntend  to  adopt a rather inflexible attitude  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to approving a request for staging such  shows,\r\n\r\nin  spite of the fact that certain sites might be more\r\n\r\nsuitable  but  because they do  not  fall  within  the\r\n\r\napproved list they are automatically turned down. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore  have a situation where a temple  celebrates\r\n\r\nits  great  occasion at one place and  the  wayang  is\r\n\r\nstaged some three or four blocks away. This reminds me\r\n\r\nof  the  effort by Government many years ago to  clamp\r\n\r\ndown   the  firing  of  crackers  by  insisting   that\r\n\r\neverybody goes to a community centre to fire crackers,\r\n\r\nnot  realising  the irrelevance of cracker  firing  at\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  and the significance  of  cracker-firing to the Chinese community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore humbly suggest to the Minister that\r\n\r\na  review  of the approved sites be made and  this  be\r\n\r\nmade on the request of the local Member of Parliament,\r\n\r\nand  also a more flexible attitude be adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nrelevant authority with better understanding and  that\r\n\r\nthe  Member of Parliament's recommendation for seeking\r\n\r\nthe permit be unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hwang, do you want to say something?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is just a point of clarification.

Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe Minister would care to clarify what he exactly\r\n\r\nmeans by \"lowest of the low\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, may I clarify the point\r\n\r\nmentioned  by the Member for Jalan Kayu? When  I  used\r\n\r\nthe  phrase \"lowest of the low\", this is in  reply  to\r\n\r\nthe phrase levelled at me - gao gao zai shang (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Since there is this description of me sitting on the top of a very high mountain, therefore, there must\r\n\r\nbe  somebody down at the very low base. But I  do  not\r\n\r\nmean  that every one is low or that there is this kind\r\n\r\nof  people in our society or that there is this  class\r\n\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is that we as elected Members are ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizens,  whether  we  are Ministers  or  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament. We pay income tax. We are equal before the\r\n\r\nlaw and we drive our own car and so on. In our society\r\n\r\nactually there is no such thing as low or high  class.\r\n\r\nBut  since there is a reference by a Member that I was\r\n\r\nsitting  on  the high top of a mountain,  therefore  I\r\n\r\nmust  refute this thinking that we are sitting on  the\r\n\r\n\"high side\" and ignoring the people on the \"low side\".\r\n\r\nI am sorry that I have given the Member for Jalan Kayu\r\n\r\nthe  wrong impression but this is really in  reply  to\r\n\r\nwhat the Member for Boon Lay has said just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must come back to the Member for Anson. When I\r\n\r\nmade  reference  to  his  age,  I  did  not  mean  any\r\n\r\ndisrespect. In fact, it is an Asian custom to  respect\r\n\r\npeople  who are old. They are supposed to be  wise.  I\r\n\r\nrespect  him for his wisdom and his wit. But I  cannot\r\n\r\npromise quick action, as he said, in culture.  I  must\r\n\r\nsay  that there is no such thing as \"instant culture\".\r\n\r\nThere  is  instant coffee or even instant Asia.  I  am\r\n\r\nsorry there is no instant culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very much concerned with the development of\r\n\r\nmusic,  as  the  Member for Katong has said.  But  the\r\n\r\nformation of an orchestra is not just money alone.  We\r\n\r\ndid have an idea of starting an orchestra. In fact, on\r\n\r\ntwo occasions we wanted to start an orchestra but they\r\n\r\nfailed  very  miserably. The success of  an  orchestra\r\n\r\ndepends  on  many  things. First,  we  must  have  the\r\n\r\ntalent. We must have enough talented musicians and  we\r\n\r\nmust  also  have the audience to enjoy the  music.  We\r\n\r\nmust also have a proper place for it to perform. We do\r\n\r\nnot have all these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong mentioned that we have enough\r\n\r\nmusicians. I beg to differ from his opinion.  Yes,  we\r\n\r\nhave  enough  musicians. We have enough  pianists  and\r\n\r\nenough  violinists,  because when parents  send  their\r\n\r\nchildren  for music education they seem to prefer  the\r\n\r\nviolin  or  the piano. But an orchestra  is  not  just\r\n\r\nformed by pianists and violinists alone. There must be\r\n\r\nmany other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkinds  of musicians in an orchestra to make the  music\r\n\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards conversion of the Victoria Memorial Hall\r\n\r\ninto  a  concert  hall, I do not know  whether  it  is\r\n\r\npossible. Apart from the fact that it is the  site  of\r\n\r\nthe  first meeting of the PAP, it means that it  is  a\r\n\r\nmonument  of  historical  interest  and  therefore  it\r\n\r\nshould   be  preserved.  But  my  own  view  is   that\r\n\r\nconverting the Victoria Memorial Hall into  a  concert\r\n\r\nhall may pose many problems. I do not know whether  or\r\n\r\nnot the acoustics there is a problem, but I am sure it\r\n\r\nis  very expensive to carry out such a conversion.  It\r\n\r\nmay  well  be  cheaper to build  a  new  concert  hall\r\n\r\nsomewhere  else  instead  of converting  the  Victoria\r\n\r\nMemorial Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Khe Bong is annoyed that some people\r\n\r\nwrite  irresponsible letters to the  press  when  they\r\n\r\nwant something done. I must inform the Member that  we\r\n\r\nare  not  in the habit of calling up newspaper editors\r\n\r\nand  telling them what they can or cannot do or print.\r\n\r\nMy  Ministry cannot be responsible for what the  press\r\n\r\npublishes.  It will also be difficult for us  to  keep\r\n\r\ntab on all the articles that appear in our newspapers.\r\n\r\nMy  Ministry will only intervene in cases of distorted\r\n\r\nreporting   on  sensitive  issues.  Newspapers   which\r\n\r\nindulge in reporting which subsequently proves  to  be\r\n\r\ninaccurate,   false   or   misleading,   are    acting\r\n\r\nirresponsibly. If they persist in doing so, they  are\r\n\r\ncreating  a  credibility  gap between  themselves  and\r\n\r\ntheir  readers, and it is up to them to  answer  their\r\n\r\nreaders. But I do not want to go into the question  of\r\n\r\nclass struggle again with the Member for Khe Bong.  Do\r\n\r\nwe ignore this kind of writing in the press? No, we do\r\n\r\nnot  ignore  them. We monitor them. We  know  what  is\r\n\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be interesting to some of the Members here\r\n\r\nbut I must say that this is one way the communists try\r\n\r\nto  create public opinion. When I was young, I used to\r\n\r\ndo  this  kind of thing. I used to write many letters,\r\n\r\nnot  just one, to the press to create a public opinion\r\n\r\nin order to prepare the masses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  a  revolution. But those were days long gone  by.\r\n\r\nBut  I  can see that the present generation of  letter\r\n\r\nwriters to newspapers are not many and they are also a\r\n\r\nbit  childish. As we monitor them, we know  what  they\r\n\r\nare doing and we would take note of them and deal with\r\n\r\nthem when the time comes. But to call them up whenever\r\n\r\nthere  is a nasty letter appearing in the press  would\r\n\r\nnot help solve anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of wayang sites raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kim  Seng. I would like to inform the House  that\r\n\r\nthe  list  of  approved wayang sites was drawn  up  in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  the  Police  and  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board in 1975 in an effort to reduce noise\r\n\r\npollution  and  traffic  congestion  that   is   often\r\n\r\nassociated with the staging of wayangs. This  list  is\r\n\r\nconstantly being revised, and there are at present 693\r\n\r\napproved sites on the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng may wish to know that my\r\n\r\nMinistry has all along been sympathetic in considering\r\n\r\napplications  for  wayang licences.  On  a  number  of\r\n\r\noccasions  wayangs are allowed to be staged  at  sites\r\n\r\nnot   on   the   approved   list,   provided   special\r\n\r\narrangements can be made by the organisers  to  reduce\r\n\r\nnoise pollution and traffic congestion. As the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board is the competent  authority  to\r\n\r\ncomment  on  the suitability of wa yang sites  in  its\r\n\r\nestates,  it is only logical for my Ministry to  refer\r\n\r\nsuch  applications to them for consideration.  But  in\r\n\r\nmany instances we are faced with the choice of whether\r\n\r\nto  please the residents in the housing estates or  to\r\n\r\nplease the wayang organisers or the Tua Pek Kong. I am\r\n\r\nsure  the Member will agree with me that when it comes\r\n\r\nto  a  decision  of this sort, it is obvious  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  let the residents have as much peaceful  sleep\r\n\r\nas possible and leave the Tua Pek Kong alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the practice to seek the consent of the\r\n\r\nowner of a site before a wa yang licence is issued. In\r\n\r\nthe  case of housing estates, since the Housing  Board\r\n\r\nis  the  owner, it is only appropriate that we  should\r\n\r\nseek the consent of the Housing Board before a licence\r\n\r\nis issued. How would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Member feel if I were to issue a licence to hold a\r\n\r\nwayang in his garden without his permission?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the need to go to an MP for approval. I think it\r\n\r\nis  wrong  to say that whenever an applicant  wants  a\r\n\r\nwayang  licence, he must go to the MP.  I  think  what\r\n\r\nhappens  is that when his application is turned  down,\r\n\r\nhe  goes to the MP. Like any other applications  which\r\n\r\nare turned down, whether it is for a wayang licence or\r\n\r\nany  other  licence, the applicant  will  normally  go\r\n\r\nstraight to his MP. In fact, there is no necessity for\r\n\r\nthe  MP to approve the wayang site. But in some cases,\r\n\r\nan  MP  writes in to recommend that a certain site  be\r\n\r\napproved for a wayang because, in his capacity  as  MP\r\n\r\nof  that  constituency, he is more familiar  with  the\r\n\r\nsite and that he would be able to tell whether or  not\r\n\r\nthe  wayang there would cause noise pollution  to  the\r\n\r\nresidents. So in this respect the MP's recommendations\r\n\r\nare also taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, when I said \"quick action\",\r\n\r\nI  mean  that it will take them 10 years. The Minister\r\n\r\nreplied  that he cannot promise quick action.  When  I\r\n\r\nsay  \"quick\" it means he will take another  10  years.\r\n\r\nThat is what I mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir,I rise to inform the\r\n\r\nMinister  that  he  is mistaken because  this  is  the\r\n\r\nexperience of all MPs in Housing Board estates.  Their\r\n\r\nrecommendation is a must before permission is  granted\r\n\r\nby the HDB Area Office for the staging of such shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second point is exactly the point I was trying\r\n\r\nto  put  forward: that the Ministry of Culture  refers\r\n\r\nthe  matter to the Housing and Development Board  Area\r\n\r\nOffice.  The Area Office tells me that they are  quite\r\n\r\nhappy  to  issue permits for certain sites  but  these\r\n\r\nsites  are  not  on  the list of  approved  sites  for\r\n\r\nstaging the shows. So it is a case of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  passing  the  buck to the  HDB  and  the  HDB\r\n\r\npassing  the buck back to the Ministry. I do not  know\r\n\r\nwho  is  right and who is wrong. Perhaps the  Minister\r\n\r\nmight like to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> May I just deal with the problem\r\n\r\nof wayang sites again. When an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication  is made for a wayang to  be  held  on  an\r\n\r\napproved  site,  nobody  bothers  about  getting   any\r\n\r\napproval  from  the MP or the Housing and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard, because  it  will normally  be  approved.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  arises  only when the wayang organiser  wants\r\n\r\nthe wayang to be held somewhere other than an approved\r\n\r\nsite, say, somewhere in front of a house or next to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  block of building. In such a case the consent\r\n\r\nof  the  residents  must be sought. Otherwise  the  MP\r\n\r\nhimself  will  be  in trouble because  if  the  wayang\r\n\r\ncauses  disturbance  to the residents  living  in  the\r\n\r\nblock  of flats or nearby, then they will complain  to\r\n\r\nthe  MP.  So to respect the rights of these residents,\r\n\r\nit  is always our practice to consult either the MP or\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  Board  officials because  they  are  the\r\n\r\npeople who would know whether or not the wayang to  be\r\n\r\nstaged on a certain site would cause a disturbance  to\r\n\r\nthe  residents.  Therefore, in  these  cases  we  must\r\n\r\nensure  that the residents are not seriously disturbed\r\n\r\nby these wayangs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, just a point of clarification. I would like to confirm\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Member for Kim Seng has said. It  is  quite\r\n\r\ncustomary for MPs to give approval before a permit  is\r\n\r\ngiven,  for  one very important reason, i.e.  I  think\r\n\r\nmany  people  who  organise  these  wayangs  are  non-residents. Some of them are professionals. They strike\r\n\r\nup  a  deal with the residents, shopkeepers or hawkers\r\n\r\nand  say, \"All right, we will organise a wayang  show.\r\n\r\nbut  how  much will we get as a matter of profit?\"  To\r\n\r\neliminate  this malpractice, invariably the  HDB  Area\r\n\r\nOfficers always ask for the MP's recommendation before\r\n\r\nofficial approval is given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Just to clarify. Sir. When I talk of a\r\n\r\nmusic  policy, of course the development of  different\r\n\r\ntypes  of  musicians would be part of this policy.  We\r\n\r\nneed  not  have an orchestra of 101 pianos  or  things\r\n\r\nlike  that.  I mentioned that we wanted to  raise  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of musical ability. May I point out that  there\r\n\r\nare  so  many school bands in Singapore. We  certainly\r\n\r\ncannot get a person\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  is  playing  in  a school  band  to  play  in  an\r\n\r\norchestra, but we can pick out the good ones. And this\r\n\r\nis  part of a music policy: to encourage the good ones\r\n\r\nand  award them scholarships to develop their  talents\r\n\r\nin  different  instruments and then  put  them  in  an\r\n\r\norchestra.  I think we want the Education Ministry  to\r\n\r\nact  in  concert with the Ministry of Culture so  that\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of orchestration may lead to the  kind  of\r\n\r\norchestra I was talking about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Victoria Memorial Hall, perhaps instead of\r\n\r\njust  dismissing  the suggestion, the Ministry  should\r\n\r\nfind  out whether it is feasible to convert it into  a\r\n\r\nconcert  hall  as it may be cheaper than spending  $10\r\n\r\nmillion to $15 million on an entirely new place for  a\r\n\r\nconcert hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, in answer to the Member for\r\n\r\nToa Payoh, it is not a matter of passing the buck.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  pass the buck to the MP. In fact, we  respect\r\n\r\nthe  rights  of  the  MP.  If  the  residents  in  his\r\n\r\nconstituency   are  disturbed,  they  would   normally\r\n\r\ncomplain  to him. Therefore, we have to ask  the  MP's\r\n\r\nopinion  whether  we should allow  the  wayang  to  be\r\n\r\nstaged on the site applied for. If the MP thinks  that\r\n\r\nthe  residents would be disturbed, then he  would  say\r\n\r\n\"No\".  But if he thinks that it would not disturb  the\r\n\r\nresidents,  then he would say \"Yes\". I hope  that  can\r\n\r\nsatisfy both parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Victoria Memorial Hall, we are - not dismissing\r\n\r\nthe idea from the Member for Katong. I was only saying\r\n\r\nthat  in my opinion it is probably cheaper to build  a\r\n\r\nnew  one. Of course, I will ask my officials  to  find\r\n\r\nout  what  is  the cost and whether it is feasible  to\r\n\r\nconvert it into a concert hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orchestra, as I have said, is not just a matter\r\n\r\nof  money and the need for an audience. Our \"Music for\r\n\r\nEveryone\"  series is doing just that -  to  create  an\r\n\r\naudience so as to make our people attuned to this kind\r\n\r\nof  music. But there is always the problem as to  what\r\n\r\nsort of music should be promoted because if we promote\r\n\r\nthe  wrong music it will not enjoy the support of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  In many instances, we found that the  Chinese\r\n\r\norchestra is a more popular one. Because of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat,  do we have to spend all our money on developing\r\n\r\na  Chinese orchestra? These are the problems that  are\r\n\r\ntroubling  us, and  I think they are  not  very  easy\r\n\r\nproblems. With all the help from the Member for Katong\r\n\r\nand others interested, we will try to solve them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, although I am\r\n\r\nnot  happy  with the reply given by the Minister, the\r\n\r\nreply  given  to  the Member for  Khe  Bong  is  quite\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.

I  would  like to  say  a  few  words.  I\r\n\r\nsympathise with the Minister for Culture. We know that\r\n\r\nCulture  is  not an easy responsibility.  As  \"half  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper man\". I understand this problem. I know that\r\n\r\nin  an  open  society it is easy to be  influenced  by\r\n\r\nothers but not easy to influence them. No matter  what\r\n\r\nwe say, no matter what we do, the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nis  always  blamed  for it. So we can  expect  further\r\n\r\nblame put on him in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyday when I read the two different newspapers in\r\n\r\ntwo languages, I get two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkinds  of  feeling.  The Chinese paper  gives  me  one\r\n\r\nfeeling  and  the  English  paper  gives  me  another.\r\n\r\nRecently  an English newspaper carried many  pages  of\r\n\r\nwriting  about a multimillionaire, how  he  tackled  a\r\n\r\nfilm  star  and  how  he came to acquire  wealth.  The\r\n\r\nChinese  newspaper  on  the other  hand  talked  about\r\n\r\nsocial  problems  and  traditional  virtues  such   as\r\n\r\nrespect  for  the  old. So in  my  mind,  I  have  two\r\n\r\ncontradictory ideals. If this were allowed  to  go  on\r\n\r\nwithout  checking our society we will have  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture intends to amend the\r\n\r\nNewspaper  and Printing Presses Act. I  do  not  agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  Member for Boon Lay that it would adversely\r\n\r\naffect the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of\r\n\r\nclarification, Sir,I did not say that  the  amendment\r\n\r\nwould adversely affect the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ntake back what I have just said. But the principle  of\r\n\r\namending this Newspaper and Printing Presses Act is to\r\n\r\nforbid  anyone  to  hold more than 3%  shares  in  any\r\n\r\nnewspaper. That is to say, unless there are 17  people\r\n\r\nin  the  family and all the 17 people have  3%  shares\r\n\r\neach  in the same newspaper, this family will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  control the newspaper. What I want to  point\r\n\r\nout  is  that the Minister for Culture should consider\r\n\r\nwhether  this  will actually achieve the  aim  because\r\n\r\nother   than   the   question  of   newspaper   bosses\r\n\r\ncontrolling  the  newspaper,  some  journalists   with\r\n\r\nulterior  motives  could also write  anything  in  any\r\n\r\nnewspaper  or  publication here or abroad  influencing\r\n\r\nthousands of people. Our Minister for Culture has just\r\n\r\nmentioned that these journalists could write all sorts\r\n\r\nof  articles.  We can control them internally  but  if\r\n\r\nthey  write in the foreign newspapers what can we  do?\r\n\r\nRecently,  some people were detained by  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Department.  Some of  them  belong  to  this\r\n\r\ncategory  of journalists. Some of them have  the  same\r\n\r\nideology  as their bosses and they could be under  the\r\n\r\ninstructions  of the bosses. But some others  actually\r\n\r\nacted contrary to the instructions of their bosses and\r\n\r\nthey might be infiltrators. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  like to point out that while the original  1974\r\n\r\nNewspaper and Printing Presses Act could not make  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers abide Government's policies, even with  the\r\n\r\namendment I doubt whether it could achieve the desired\r\n\r\naim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now some Members of Parliament, including the\r\n\r\nMember for Boon Lay have commented on the work of  the\r\n\r\nRTS in diverse manner. I feel that when the workers in\r\n\r\nthe RTS produce programmes, they usually copy what the\r\n\r\nWesterners are doing. What I mean is this. The foreign\r\n\r\nprofessional artistes can perform better than some  of\r\n\r\nour  amateurs.  For  example, programmes  like  \"Enjoy\r\n\r\nYourself\"  and  \"Under The Same  Roof\"  are  Cantonese\r\n\r\nfilms which are imported are quite popular, of course.\r\n\r\nSo  our  TV  producers tend to copy and  they  produce\r\n\r\nfilms  like  \"Chinese Variety Show\" and  \"The  $50,000\r\n\r\nQuestion\".  These programmes are in Chinese.  When  we\r\n\r\ncompare  locally produced programmes with the imported\r\n\r\nones,  we  feel  \"dead\",  \"angry\",  or  \"our  domestic\r\n\r\nflowers are not as fragrant as the wild flowers\". Some\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament have remarked that we should not\r\n\r\npick  the  wild flowers. Some people like the \"Guthrie\r\n\r\nHour\".  This  programme is all right. Of course,  this\r\n\r\ncould  be  better  than some of the  other  programmes\r\n\r\nproduced  locally.  I do not know  whether  the  other\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament agree with me on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. When considering these\r\n\r\npoints,  the Ministry of Culture should \"look  at  the\r\n\r\nmajor  points and work from the minor points\", in  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of various cultural activities.  Take,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  our  annual  Chingay procession.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  what it means. Why is it  not  called  the\r\n\r\nZhuang  Yi  procession\" or some other  transliteration\r\n\r\ninstead of Chingay procession? This is a far cry  from\r\n\r\nthe correct tenor of our Minister for Culture when  he\r\n\r\nstated  last  month  in this House  that  we  have  to\r\n\r\n\"remove  the weeds to preserve the essence\". Then,  to\r\n\r\nkeep  alive these old traditional things might not  be\r\n\r\ntoo good for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already\r\n\r\nstated   in  my  speech  during  the  debate  on   the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Address that we are not seeking  further\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the  press. The object  of  the  proposed\r\n\r\namendment is not to control the press but to  redefine\r\n\r\nthe  ownership of newspapers so that no single  family\r\n\r\nor a single minor group can own a newspaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the press is not whether or not we\r\n\r\nshould  control it. In fact, we do not want to control\r\n\r\nthe  press.  We  want it to be a free and  responsible\r\n\r\npress.  But we have to be constantly alert so that  no\r\n\r\ncommunists or pro-communists can infiltrate  into  the\r\n\r\npress  and  make  use  of it to disseminate  communist\r\n\r\npropaganda. No matter what we do or no matter what law\r\n\r\nwe  pass,  it can never be perfect and, therefore,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  alert. We have to monitor  the  kind  of\r\n\r\narticles that is being published in the newspapers  in\r\n\r\norder to get an account of what the situation is  with\r\n\r\nthe press, and I think we are doing just that. We know\r\n\r\nwhat  the press is doing and how it is being operated.\r\n\r\nBut  I  think it is wrong to say that we seek  further\r\n\r\ncontrol of the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of TV programmes, the Member for\r\n\r\nHenderson  said  that  we  are  lavishly  copying  the\r\n\r\nforeign productions from Hong Kong and Taiwan. This is\r\n\r\nnot true because when we produce our own programmes we\r\n\r\nnormally have our own local artistes and local writers\r\n\r\nto  write  out the scripts. However, the form  may  be\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  those  programmes which  we  import  from\r\n\r\nabroad.  But then TV programmes are more or  less  the\r\n\r\nsame,  whether they are produced in Taiwan, Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nor   even  in  Singapore.  A  great  number  of  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that we acquire from Taiwan or  from  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  are  mainly  of  an  historical  interest.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms  and  the\r\n\r\nRise of the Tang Dynasty are of historical interest. I\r\n\r\nthink it would give our people a very good opportunity\r\n\r\nto  learn  about  the history of China, or  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter the history of other countries, if we are  able\r\n\r\nto get those programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible for us as yet to achieve the same\r\n\r\nstandard of production as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforeign  programme  as the funds  and  the  number  of\r\n\r\nprofessional script writers and artistes is greater in\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  and  Taiwan. They even pay  more  for  the\r\n\r\nproduction.  As  a  result  the  standard   of   local\r\n\r\nproduction  is  not as good as that in Hong  Hong  and\r\n\r\nTaiwan.  But  surely the Member for Henderson  is  not\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  we should therefore  stop  producing\r\n\r\ndramas  or that even if we continue to produce  dramas\r\n\r\nwhich  are directly related to our milieu and  reflect\r\n\r\nour values, aspirations, and problems, we should never\r\n\r\nproduce  them in this form. I think we are  trying  to\r\n\r\nproduce these programmes in the best way we can. I can\r\n\r\nassure  him that we are not really copying or lavishly\r\n\r\nimitating what the foreign artistes are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word \"Chingay\" is a transliteration of the\r\n\r\nChinese characters zhuang yi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) in the Hokkien\r\n\r\ndialect. Zhuang means \"makeup, hua zhuang (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Yi\r\n\r\n(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) means \"art\". So translated literally, it means the\r\n\r\nart  of  making-up.  In fact, this  procession  is  to\r\n\r\ncommemorate a festival which originated in Penang. One\r\n\r\nauthoritative definition of Chingay is that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nsort  of a carriage borne on the shoulders of men.  It\r\n\r\nis a gorgeous representation of some historical scene.\r\n\r\nThis  Chingay  procession  is a  religious-cum-secular\r\n\r\nfestival  originally held in Penang,  usually  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle of every first lunar calendar month dating back\r\n\r\nto  the second half of the last century. As time  goes\r\n\r\non  the  occasion  became more  and  more  festive  in\r\n\r\nnature.  Eventually  items in the procession  included\r\n\r\ngiant   triangular  flags,  colourful   lanterns   and\r\n\r\nbanners,  musical  bands, decorative  floats,   stilt\r\n\r\nwalkers, troupes and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is not happy that the three Chinese\r\n\r\nlegendary  figures Fu Lu Shou are being  presented  in\r\n\r\nChingay.  I  do  not  agree  with  him  that  this  is\r\n\r\nfeudalistic in nature. What is the meaning  of  Fu  Lu\r\n\r\nShou (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)?. Fu means good living, presumably. Xin guang\r\n\r\nti pan (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) that means \"a very broad waist\". But\r\n\r\nI  do not think that that is a good thing nowadays. Lu\r\n\r\nis good opportunity in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlife.  Shou  is \"long life\".

This is what  a  good  government\r\n\r\nshould be. And what is wrong in projecting these three\r\n\r\nlegendary  figures even though they may  be  very  old\r\n\r\ncustom? This is exactly the kind of tradition we  want\r\n\r\nto  preserve.  We  want  to  symbolise  this  sort  of\r\n\r\naspiration.

I\r\n\r\nonly spoke on Lu - Fu Lu Shou. Lu is not so simple  as\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Minister. If he refers to the Chinese\r\n\r\ndictionary,  he  may  go  deeper  and  find  that   it\r\n\r\ndescribes a man too ambitious for powers, for a higher\r\n\r\nposition. Well, basically I am saying whether we  want\r\n\r\nto  copy  the right things from foreign countries  and\r\n\r\ndiscard the bad things. Like the word Chingay, if  the\r\n\r\nMinister agrees that Chingay is right, well, it is  up\r\n\r\nto  the Minister to decide. But if the Minister  says,\r\n\r\n\"Better  correct it to Zhuang Yi procession\"  or  some\r\n\r\nother  transliteration, it is up to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of this I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead BAA 1101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Sembawang has just raised a\r\n\r\npoint on the production of documentaries for screening\r\n\r\nin  our cinemas and the Hon. Minister has replied that\r\n\r\nit  is not considered. However, we must recognise that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  constant  need to  promote  and  develop\r\n\r\nnational    consciousness    among    our    citizens,\r\n\r\nparticularly  our young, through the mass  media  like\r\n\r\nTV.  Documentary  films  or  newsreels  depicting  our\r\n\r\nnational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  health and safety measures, educational\r\n\r\nand  cultural activities, are from time to time  shown\r\n\r\non  TV.  But  all  of us know that TV  programmes  are\r\n\r\nscreened  at fixed times, and these times may  not  be\r\n\r\nconvenient for all home viewers to tune in to.  Or  on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  if the titles are not  sufficiently\r\n\r\nattractive   enough,  viewers  could   miss   a   good\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reach a wider audience and also at the\r\n\r\nsame  time to achieve good impact, may I suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Culture make it compulsory for cinemas\r\n\r\nto  screen such documentaries and newsreels  that  are\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to time made available by RTS. After  all,\r\n\r\nmost  of the cinemas, or I should say all of them,  do\r\n\r\nscreen   documentaries  and  newsreels  from   foreign\r\n\r\ncountries  which  in some cases have no  relevance  to\r\n\r\nSingapore at all. With the revenue thus collected from\r\n\r\nthese   documentaries  and  newsreels,   perhaps   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture could further develop and  expand\r\n\r\nits  publicity services to cater to the needs  of  our\r\n\r\nyoung citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir,I beg to differ from the\r\n\r\nMember for Toa Payoh that the cinema reaches a  wider\r\n\r\naudience. In fact, I think it is the other way  round.\r\n\r\nTelevision and radio together would reach a far  wider\r\n\r\naudience  than the cinema. The number of  TV  licences\r\n\r\n31st December, 1976\r\n\r\n309,276,  and  an estimated number of 940,000  viewers\r\n\r\nwatch  television on any one night. Moreover.  70%  of\r\n\r\nthe population tune in daily to radio broadcasts. Thus\r\n\r\ntelevision  and  radio have become the most  effective\r\n\r\nmeans  through  which  publicity  programmes  can   be\r\n\r\ntransmitted. So when the documentaries are screened on\r\n\r\ntelevision, I think at any one time we would  be  able\r\n\r\nto  reach the majority of the people. Also if it  does\r\n\r\nnot  reach  them  at  all, the documentaries  that  we\r\n\r\nproduce which are meaningful and of good value are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nusually  repeated. So the chances of the  audience  or\r\n\r\nthe people missing them are actually very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is possible to make it compulsory\r\n\r\nfor the cinemas to show the newsreels or documentaries\r\n\r\nproduced  by RTS because the RTS produce  only  16  mm\r\n\r\nfilms.  All the cinemas are screening 35 mm films,  so\r\n\r\nit  is not possible for them to screen the 16 mm films\r\n\r\nmade  available  by RTS. If we do not  produce  35  mm\r\n\r\nfilms for our documentaries, it is not possible for us\r\n\r\nto compel the cinemas to screen them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already stated in my reply to the Member\r\n\r\nfor Sembawang, since television has already taken over\r\n\r\nthis  function, I think it is more economical  to  let\r\n\r\nthe RTS handle this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nquite  agree  with what the Minister has said  -  that\r\n\r\nsince  we have TV newsreels, there is no need for  the\r\n\r\ncinemas to screen newsreels and documentary films.  My\r\n\r\npoint  is that the TV audience and the cinema audience\r\n\r\nare   quite  different.  The  films  screened  in  the\r\n\r\ncinemas,  because they are 35 mm films, will  leave  a\r\n\r\ndeeper impression on the audience. As regards the  TV,\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  people may not bother  to  watch  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes. They are interested in feature  films.  If\r\n\r\nwe  screen  or telecast some local documentary  films,\r\n\r\nmany   of   them  will  not  watch  such   programmes.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if these documentaries are screened in  the\r\n\r\ncinemas,  then the people will be more  aware  of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopments going on in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\njust  like  to  reply  to  one  point  raised  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  He has given some statistics on the  number\r\n\r\nof  TV  licences and so on. One of the points  he  has\r\n\r\nmissed is this. Whatever documentaries or newsreels we\r\n\r\nproduce,  a lot depends on the title. If the title  is\r\n\r\nunattractive enough for the home audience, they  will\r\n\r\nnot  tune  in.  For instance, whenever TV  news  or  a\r\n\r\ndocumentary  comes on, some families just  switch  off\r\n\r\nand  wait  for the next feature programme.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  he  can base his argument on the number  of  TV\r\n\r\nsets owned by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by the Member for Sembawang, if these\r\n\r\ndocumentaries  are shown in the cinemas, there  is  a\r\n\r\nready  audience and the impact is very  much  greater.\r\n\r\nBut  I accept the Minister's explanation that the size\r\n\r\nof  the  film  matters in producing documentaries  and\r\n\r\nnewsreels. In so doing, I would like to beg  leave  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead CAA 1101* (*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs\r\n\r\nAhmad Haleem and Ch'ng Jit Koon).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is encouraging to learn that there will be\r\n\r\nmore colour TV programmes in the near future. However,\r\n\r\nthe  chief  complaint  from  almost  every  viewer  of\r\n\r\npopular   English  programmes  is  the  indiscriminate\r\n\r\nmanner   in  which  the  advertisements  are  inserted\r\n\r\nbetween  the programmes. One or two is tolerable,  but\r\n\r\nmore than 10 is unthinkable. And most of the time  the\r\n\r\nadvertisements  are inserted during  an  important  or\r\n\r\nexciting part of the story. Most probably the Minister\r\n\r\nmay say that it is for revenue purposes. Yes, I accept\r\n\r\nthat. But the advertisements should be screened before\r\n\r\nor after a programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only irritating but reduces the enjoyment\r\n\r\nof  a  programme.  I would therefore strongly  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  advertisements be screened  before  or  after  a\r\n\r\nprogramme or once during a programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If RTS says that we are better off in this respect\r\n\r\ncompared to other countries, then I think they may not\r\n\r\nbe  right  because other countries have two  stations,\r\n\r\nthat is, commercial and national. There should not  be\r\n\r\ntoo   many   commercial  advertisements  in   our   TV\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Tamil section of RTS still leaves much to\r\n\r\nbe  desired.  The Tamil films are still shown  on  two\r\n\r\ndifferent  days at a late hour instead of  one  single\r\n\r\nday.  The excuse that Tamil films are too long  to  be\r\n\r\nshown on a single day is a lame one. Further, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naggravate  the  situation,  there  seems  to   be   no\r\n\r\npunctuality  in screening times. Sometimes  the  films\r\n\r\nare  screened  as late as 15 minutes past  the  stated\r\n\r\ntime. I thought RTS possess a crystal clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought up this matter during the last Budget\r\n\r\ndebate.  I am very fed up about this. Somebody  shouts\r\n\r\nat  the  sun. What is the use of shouting at the  sun?\r\n\r\nThe sun does not care. The one who shouts will suffer.\r\n\r\nAlthough  I  bring this matter up at every session  of\r\n\r\nthe  Budget debate, no action has been taken.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister has got no power. On paper  he  has\r\n\r\nthe power but not in action. There must be somebody in\r\n\r\nthe  RTS  who  is  victimising the  Tamil  programmes.\r\n\r\nSomebody  must  look  into  this  matter.  Maybe  some\r\n\r\nofficers need to be called up to pull up their socks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children's programmes are insipid as one can\r\n\r\nthink  of.  The viewers are tired of seeing  the  same\r\n\r\nscene  of  children  gathering  round  an  adult   and\r\n\r\nfollowing the same rigmarole. Cannot the producers  be\r\n\r\nmore   imaginative?  Perhaps  some  of  the   imported\r\n\r\nprogrammes  could  be  a  guide  for  producing   more\r\n\r\ncreative programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears that there is no outdoor shooting\r\n\r\nfor  Tamil  colour TV programmes as we  have  for  the\r\n\r\nother  language programmes. Why is this so?  Why  must\r\n\r\nRTS  be  victimising  the Tamil  programme?  I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand. After all the Tamil people are also paying\r\n\r\nIncome Tax and paying the same amount of licence fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the shooting of Tamil programmes is done\r\n\r\nmostly during the weekdays. And on Sundays the studios\r\n\r\nare  not  made  available for the  shooting  of  Tamil\r\n\r\nprogrammes  because  the other groups  are  using  the\r\n\r\nstudios.  If  the studios cannot be used  on  Sundays.\r\n\r\nthen  how  can the Tamil section get the artistes  who\r\n\r\nmay be available only on Sundays because of the nature\r\n\r\nof their work? If this goes on, the Tamil section will\r\n\r\nnever progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know what method is used\r\n\r\nin  the selection of singers for the Tamil programmes.\r\n\r\nIt  seems  that during auditioning there  is  no  band\r\n\r\npresent  and  the selection is made at the  whims  and\r\n\r\nfancies of the auditioners. Thus when the artistes are\r\n\r\nselected  and  when they are actually  performing  the\r\n\r\naccompanying   band  at  times  finds  difficulty   in\r\n\r\nfollowing the artistes who had been auditioned without\r\n\r\na band.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no wonder that the standard of production of\r\n\r\nTamil programmes is so poor. Something must be done to\r\n\r\nencourage  better  quality programmes  for  the  Tamil\r\n\r\nSection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally. Sir, there is a lot of emphasis on\r\n\r\nbilingualism  by  the  Education  Ministry.  Why   not\r\n\r\nintroduce some programmes on TV in the later  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  evening to cater for working adults? Then we will\r\n\r\nbe   educating  a  nation  of  youngsters  and  adults\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is that when you tune to the Tamil\r\n\r\nradio  wave  band you cannot get the Tamil  programme.\r\n\r\nAll  over  Singapore the radio broadcast in  Tamil  is\r\n\r\nvery  poor. That is also a form of victimisation! When\r\n\r\nthe  Tamil  people  tune to the  Tamil  section, they\r\n\r\ncannot get the programme. The broadcasting section  in\r\n\r\nthe  Tamil network is very poor. All the time  we  are\r\n\r\nfighting  with  the  RTS  and,  therefore,   the   RTS\r\n\r\npurposely do this. This is because the Minister has no\r\n\r\npower.  Let  us see what happens to what I speak  here\r\n\r\ntoday.  Tomorrow  you will see the result.  They  will\r\n\r\nstill `victimise' the Tamil programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  draw the Minister's attention to the use presently\r\n\r\nmade  of  the intervals between television  programmes\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not taken up with advertising commercials.\r\n\r\nUsually  this  interval  time  is  about  one  or  two\r\n\r\nminutes'   duration  during  which  nobody  wants   to\r\n\r\nadvertise.  This interval is normally filled  in  with\r\n\r\nfilms  on  fishes, flowers or girls singing  songs  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  That  is all right. But  if  you  keep  on\r\n\r\nseeing it four times a day, it becomes monotonous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that to stimulate interest - the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Toa Payoh said there was no attraction to  coming\r\n\r\nprogrammes - the RTS make a 10 or 15-second extract of\r\n\r\nthe  programmes  that are to be  shown  later  in  the\r\n\r\nevening, the next day or the next week. This  is  just\r\n\r\nlike  the  Akan Datang in the cinema. In this  way  it\r\n\r\nwill  stimulate  interest. The title  of  a  programme\r\n\r\nmight not appear to be very interesting, but if the TV\r\n\r\ncould  show something interesting in Akan Datang  more\r\n\r\npeople  might watch the programme. And if  advertisers\r\n\r\nthink that more people will watch the programme,  they\r\n\r\nwill  want to advertise, and therefore there  is  more\r\n\r\nrevenue  for the RTS. Maybe the Tamil programme  might\r\n\r\nthen  not be so badly victimised. There will  be  more\r\n\r\nmoney  and the local TV production might benefit  from\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the extracts, I think the RTS could show\r\n\r\nmore  filmlets. I think they do a very good  job  with\r\n\r\nthe  \"Save  Water\"  campaign where we  see  Bobo,  the\r\n\r\nelephant, saving water. The same thing could  be  done\r\n\r\nfor  the  campaign  against drugs. We  also  have  the\r\n\r\npolice campaigns such as \"Don't road hog\" and \"Keep in\r\n\r\nlane\". But what does \"Don't road hog\" mean? RTS  could\r\n\r\nmake  a  10  or  20-second filmlet to show  what  road\r\n\r\nhogging  means. For 15 seconds you can do a  filmlet.\r\n\r\nBut  there seems to be no such shows of an educational\r\n\r\nvalue for our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could also use it as a public service. If there\r\n\r\nis an announcement for a public service, the RTS could\r\n\r\nput  it down on a piece of card and screen it over the\r\n\r\nTV.  But  there is nothing on this. Nobody  shows  any\r\n\r\ninterest. Nobody reads and nobody does anything  about\r\n\r\nit.  If they can have a little film to show the people\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a cultural show coming  up,  a  quick,\r\n\r\nlittle excerpt of one or two scenes from the show will\r\n\r\ncreate  a little interest. All this could be  done  by\r\n\r\nRTS.  I  am sure it will be very well received by  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to come to the presentation of news\r\n\r\nand  newsreel. There has been some improvement in  the\r\n\r\npresentation but it still leaves a lot to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesired.  They  seem  to  be  bankrupt  of  ideas   of\r\n\r\npresenting  the news. You can switch off  the  TV  and\r\n\r\nlisten to the news on radio; it is just the same.  All\r\n\r\nyou  see  on  TV  is the news reader reading,  looking\r\n\r\ndown,  now looking up, and quickly looking down again.\r\n\r\nThe news presentation over television should be better\r\n\r\nthan what we get from the radio. If it is the same  as\r\n\r\non  radio, we might as well not have news presentation\r\n\r\nover TV. They need only say. \"For news, please tune in\r\n\r\nto  Radio  Singapore.\" Then the film clips. When  they\r\n\r\nsay something about a news item, use the film clip. We\r\n\r\ndo  not  want to see the same stuff all the  time.  We\r\n\r\nhave  a  situation where if something is happening  in\r\n\r\nthe Middle East or in a town in Thailand, for example.\r\n\r\n140  km  out of Bangkok, out comes a map of  Thailand,\r\n\r\nbut it shows \"Bangkok\". But where is this town that is\r\n\r\n140  km away from Bangkok? Nobody knows. It just shows\r\n\r\na  map  of  Thailand. Where is Bangkok?  What  is  the\r\n\r\npoint?  They  might as well not show the  map.  Nobody\r\n\r\nknows.  If  they  want  to show something,  then  show\r\n\r\nexactly  where  it is. Show an arrow pointing  to  the\r\n\r\ntown and say. \"This is the town of Chulat\" or whatever\r\n\r\nit  is.  Then we will know. If they just want to  show\r\n\r\nThailand, they might just as well forget it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes when listening to a news item, the news\r\n\r\nreader reads about one topic and in the same breath he\r\n\r\nor  she  continues with the next topic, and I  say  to\r\n\r\nmyself, \"What relevance has this item got to the first\r\n\r\none?\" Suddenly I realise that he or she is on the next\r\n\r\nnews  item.  Maybe  an  educational  programme  or   a\r\n\r\ntraining could be given. After every topic he  or  she\r\n\r\nshould wait two or three seconds, and then carry on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is that the news readers look as\r\n\r\nthough  they have just returned from a funeral.  There\r\n\r\nis  no smile. They should at least put on a smile.  If\r\n\r\nit  is a sombre piece of news, he looks sombre, and if\r\n\r\nit  is a happy news he looks happy. At the end of  the\r\n\r\nprogramme he says, \"That is all for the news  tonight.\r\n\r\nGood  night.\"  And smile. But they do not  do  such  a\r\n\r\nthing. They look as if they are zombies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point, Sir, We have this background music.\r\n\r\nDo  not  tell me that we have no talent on  background\r\n\r\nmusic. I think it is not a question of talent but just\r\n\r\na  simple  question  of laziness.  In  every  newsreel\r\n\r\nsomeone  just picks up an LP and just change from  one\r\n\r\nmusic  to  another  with no regard to  what  is  being\r\n\r\nshown. I once saw a newsreel showing the tragedy of an\r\n\r\nearthquake, and the background music was like  cowboys\r\n\r\nfighting  with the Red Indians. One day my family  was\r\n\r\nwatching  a Malay drama programme, and I was  speaking\r\n\r\nto my grandmother. I was there and I was listening. It\r\n\r\nwas  a  Malay  drama  programme.  It  was  not  a  sad\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Neither was it a happy programme.  It  was\r\n\r\njust  a  normal scene. The background music was \"Jesus\r\n\r\nChrist  Superstar!\"  This is a  Malay  programme.  The\r\n\r\nmusic  has no relevance at all. It seems that somebody\r\n\r\njust  picked up a musical record from the library  and\r\n\r\njust  played. He did not care what music ought  to  go\r\n\r\nwith  the  programme. If they want to make a programme\r\n\r\ninteresting,  the background music should  create  the\r\n\r\nright atmosphere. There is no atmosphere at all to the\r\n\r\nlocal Malay drama programmes. That is probably one  of\r\n\r\nthe  reasons why local production has failed. One does\r\n\r\nnot  anyhow  play  any  music he  likes.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  look into this, and it does  not  cost\r\n\r\nvery  much  to  make an improvement.  I  do  hope  the\r\n\r\nimprovements will be evident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Sir, RTS and the\r\n\r\nNational  Theatre Trust occasionally run  song-writing\r\n\r\ncompetitions.  The  winning entries  are  occasionally\r\n\r\nplayed  over TV Singapore as interludes. This is  very\r\n\r\ncommendable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say songs sometimes cheer our hearts - if they\r\n\r\nare lively. Some songs make us feel romantic - if they\r\n\r\nare  love songs. Songs also touch our hearts - if they\r\n\r\nare sad songs. Songs can arouse feelings of patriotism\r\n\r\nand strengthen our unity as a nation - if the music is\r\n\r\nstirring   and   the  words  express  adequately   our\r\n\r\naspirations and national pride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other countries, people have national songs or\r\n\r\nfolk  songs that unite them. Whether it be in time  of\r\n\r\nwar  or  peace, in the battle field or in  the  cafes,\r\n\r\nthey sing these songs with such gusto and feeling  and\r\n\r\nfeel good after that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, because we are a multicultural society\r\n\r\nwith a comparatively short history, we have so far few\r\n\r\nsongs  that  we can call our very own.  As  a  result,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is a group of national servicemen,  youth\r\n\r\ngroups of the People's Association or groups of  trade\r\n\r\nunionists, when they sing, they sing songs from  other\r\n\r\nlands  that have no significance or relevance  to  us.\r\n\r\nThese  songs  may  help them let off their  steam  and\r\n\r\nexuberance,  but  they certainly  do  not  stir  their\r\n\r\nhearts  and  spirit  as one united  people,  as  proud\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, song writing competitions should be\r\n\r\nencouraged.  The winning entries should  not  only  be\r\n\r\nplayed  over TV Singapore as interludes, but  also  be\r\n\r\ndistributed  to  schools, national  servicemen,  youth\r\n\r\ngroups,  trade  unionists, etc, and  all  should  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to sing, so that a time will come when  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will have in common, Singapore  songs  to\r\n\r\nsing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> May I begin with a reply to the\r\n\r\nMember    for    Anson's   first    query    regarding\r\n\r\nadvertisements on television by setting the matter  in\r\n\r\nperspective? The TV Commercial Service was inaugurated\r\n\r\nin  January  1964. The rationale for it was explicitly\r\n\r\nstated by my predecessor, now the Foreign Minister, in\r\n\r\nhis  speech at the inauguration ceremony. Of the three\r\n\r\nways  of  financing television, television advertising\r\n\r\nwas  considered  by  my predecessor  to  be  the  only\r\n\r\npractical  and  relatively painless way  of  financing\r\n\r\ntelevision without making undue demands on the pockets\r\n\r\nof  the viewer or of the taxpayer. The position  still\r\n\r\nholds good today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TV commercials are not indiscriminately\r\n\r\ninserted   into   programmes.  Almost   all   of   the\r\n\r\nentertainment  programmes that  are  acquired  by  RTS\r\n\r\nhave, in fact, built-in commercial breaks or junctures\r\n\r\ndesigned by overseas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproducers of the programmes themselves. We do not make\r\n\r\nthe  breaks.  The  breaks were already  there  in  the\r\n\r\nfilms,  Maybe  the  commercial  comes  in  during   an\r\n\r\nexciting moment but it is already there. We do not put\r\n\r\nit there. Naturally, when the producer makes his film,\r\n\r\nhe wants the viewers to watch the commercials during a\r\n\r\nvery exciting scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A one-hour programme has normally about six such\r\n\r\nbuilt-in    breaks   for   the   insertion    of    TV\r\n\r\nadvertisements. In a half-hour programme. RTS works on\r\n\r\na maximum of two such breaks for advertisement and not\r\n\r\nmore  than 7-8% of the total weekly transmission  time\r\n\r\nis   given  to  commercials  or  advertisements.  This\r\n\r\ncompares to the 17% to 25% devoted to commercials  in          \r\n\r\nthe  case of other stations. If he thinks that we have\r\n\r\ntoo  many  commercials, he should take a look  at  the\r\n\r\nother  stations. I should refer him to an  article  in\r\n\r\nSunday, 6th March, 1977. It is entitled\r\n\r\n\"Where TV is really commercial\", and I quote:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Bangkok: In most countries when a commercial\r\n\r\ninterrupts a television programme the viewer has  time\r\n\r\nto whip out to the kitchen and grab a cold beer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Thailand, he has time for a shower. Often, he can\r\n\r\nalso  take  a shampoo. And still have time to  go  for\r\n\r\nthat beer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It went on to say that a viewer with a stopwatch timed\r\n\r\na  show \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" and he found that\r\n\r\nthe  show ran for about 48 minutes but the commercials\r\n\r\nwent  on  to about 35 minutes. And there was a  boxing\r\n\r\nshow.  The  whole of the boxing show came to  only  45\r\n\r\nminutes  but  there were 63 minutes of commercials  in\r\n\r\nthat  45  minutes of boxing. That is really commerical\r\n\r\nTV that you find in other stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated in this House last month, no\r\n\r\ncommercials or advertisements are allowed in the  News\r\n\r\nand   in  informational  and  educational  programmes,\r\n\r\nalthough  commercial interest or inquiries  have  been\r\n\r\nmade  in this direction. As for the commercials  being\r\n\r\ninserted   only   before  or   after   or   in-between\r\n\r\nprogrammes, I think the advertisers have to  be  given\r\n\r\nsome  measure  of return in terms of  the  money  they\r\n\r\nspend on TV advertisements. This would be an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassurance  that  there  are  viewers  to  watch  their\r\n\r\nadvertisements when they come on. It is no use  having\r\n\r\nit at the beginning or at the end when TV viewers just\r\n\r\ndisappear after the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson seems to have a kind of complex\r\n\r\nthat  he  is being victimised. I can assure  him  that\r\n\r\nthis is not the case. I am not a person who would like\r\n\r\nto  victimise anyone, least of all our Tamil  friends.\r\n\r\nHe was talking about the lack of Tamil films or that a\r\n\r\nTamil  film  is  broken up into  two  parts.  But  the\r\n\r\nproblem is this. The average length of a Tamil film is\r\n\r\nalways  very  long,  sometimes 2 1/2  hours  running  and\r\n\r\nsometimes  three hours or four hours. If  we  were  to\r\n\r\nshow  the  Tamil film in a single evening, then  there\r\n\r\nwould  be no other shows except that Tamil film.  This\r\n\r\nwill  be  unfair,  and we would be  victimising  other\r\n\r\nviewers.  If  we  continue to  do  this  we  may  even\r\n\r\nantagonise other viewers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, on a point of\r\n\r\nclarification. Tamil films are usually shown  late  in\r\n\r\nthe night. Although the film lasts 2 1/2 hours or 3 hours\r\n\r\nmany  parts  are being cut. So the full  film  is  not\r\n\r\nbeing shown. There are some parts which are cut,  e.g.\r\n\r\nwhere songs are sung. We are not victimising the other\r\n\r\nviewers.  When a programme is fixed for 10 o'clock  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  shown at 10 o'clock. If it is scheduled  for\r\n\r\n10.15 then it must be 10.15. But when it is fixed  for\r\n\r\n10  o'clock it is not shown until 10.20 or 10.30. What\r\n\r\nis the RTS doing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I will come to this point about\r\n\r\npunctuality.   Punctuality   is   given   very   great\r\n\r\nimportance  by  RTS.  Where  programmes  are  delayed,\r\n\r\nnormally   it  is  because  of  special   reports   or\r\n\r\nParliamentary  reports which affect the starting  time\r\n\r\nof  the  programmes that follow. Sometimes  Parliament\r\n\r\nsits  but in the case of the last President's Address.\r\n\r\nParliament sittings were extended for two days.  There\r\n\r\nwas  no  prior  planning  for  this  because  the  RTS\r\n\r\nschedule is normally fixed two weeks ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am not talking about the\r\n\r\nPresident's Speech or Parliament sittings. During week\r\n\r\ndays when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  are no Parliament sittings. I notice  that  for\r\n\r\nthe  last two programmes although it was fixed for  10\r\n\r\no'clock  it did not start until 10.15 or 10.20.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot objecting to the Parliamentary report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I am only just quoting this\r\n\r\nas  an  example. It is not only just the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nreport.  There may be some other show which  comes  up\r\n\r\nunexpectedly, for instance, a football match or a more\r\n\r\nexciting show. This has to be inserted apart from  the\r\n\r\nnormal  schedule and, therefore, the timing is  upset.\r\n\r\nBut   such  changes,  whenever  possible, are  always\r\n\r\nconveyed  to  the press for reflecting  in  the  day's\r\n\r\nschedule. And if the changes cannot be conveyed to the\r\n\r\npress in time they will always be publicised on TV  as\r\n\r\noften  as  possible.  We try very  much  to  keep  our\r\n\r\nprogrammes  on time but sometimes it goes  beyond  our\r\n\r\ncontrol and we have to go beyond the scheduled time. I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  the  Member for Anson  that  this  is  no\r\n\r\nvictimisation. This is purely because something  crops\r\n\r\nup apart from the normal schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to his criticism on a lack of outdoor\r\n\r\nshooting facilities for Tamil programmes, I must point\r\n\r\nout  that  outdoor filming facilities are limited.  So\r\n\r\npriority  is  given to news coverages and  documentary\r\n\r\nfilms,  The materials shot are then used in  news  and\r\n\r\nnewsreel  and documentary films produced  in  all  the\r\n\r\nfour  languages, including Tamil. A news  magazine  in\r\n\r\nTamil,  mainly  made  up  of film  materials  shot  on\r\n\r\noutside location, is also produced monthly. There  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   no   question   of   discrimination    or\r\n\r\nvictimisation  at  all.  It is  inevitable  that  most\r\n\r\nproductions,  irrespective of languages,  have  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried out on week days as there is only one Saturday\r\n\r\nand one Sunday per week. We cannot make it any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convenience of artistes is taken into\r\n\r\nconsideration  as  far as possible in  scheduling  the\r\n\r\nrecording  dates of programmes. Children's  programmes\r\n\r\nand  family  magazines  in  Tamil  are,  for  example,\r\n\r\nsometimes shot on a Saturday afternoon or on a Sunday.\r\n\r\nFor  other types of TV productions in Tamil, we  often\r\n\r\ngo out of our way to arrange for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecordings  in  the  evenings on  week  days  whenever\r\n\r\nartistes are unable to come in the day. Apart from the\r\n\r\nabove,  it is to be noted that the production crew  in\r\n\r\nour studios are entitled to have at least one rest day\r\n\r\nper  month,  either on a Saturday or on a  Sunday.  So\r\n\r\ntherefore  there are even fewer Saturdays and  Sundays\r\n\r\nto go round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singers for Tamil programmes are selected and\r\n\r\nauditioned  by a panel of three judges.  A  singer  is\r\n\r\ntested and auditioned basically for voice quality  and\r\n\r\nability  to  sing with the required tone,  rhythm  and\r\n\r\ncorrect pronunciation, and therefore there is no  need\r\n\r\nfor a band to accompany the singer.\r\n\r\nHowever, before a programme is recorded, the singer is\r\n\r\ngiven  ample  time to practise with  the  band  during\r\n\r\nrehearsals  at  the studios. The quality  of  all  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes  depends  very  much  on  the  standard  of\r\n\r\navailable artistes, including singers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion from the Member for Telok Blangah\r\n\r\nthat RTS should utilise some of the interlude time  to\r\n\r\nshow trailers or excerpts of forthcoming programmes is\r\n\r\na  good  one. In fact, this is being done on a  modest\r\n\r\nscale  through slides and announcements of outstanding\r\n\r\nentertainment programmes or other special  events.  To\r\n\r\nprepare  trailers on a more elaborate scale  which  he\r\n\r\nhas   in  mind  would  require  more  production   and\r\n\r\ntechnical  efforts  and  facilities  which   are   not\r\n\r\navailable  at  present. Attempts during the  last  two\r\n\r\nfinancial  years to obtain two posts  to  back-up  and\r\n\r\nimprove  our  present  TV gathering  and  presentation\r\n\r\nunits  were rejected. Until such time as the necessary\r\n\r\nstaff  are  provided, the present  modest  methods  of\r\n\r\nadvance publicity will have to continue. In any  case,\r\n\r\nwe will try to vary and improve these interludes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that the effect which simple\r\n\r\ntraffic  slogans or other subjects have on TV  viewers\r\n\r\nmight  be  limited. However, when these  are  combined\r\n\r\nwith   other   media,   the  total   impact   can   be\r\n\r\nconsiderable, The RTS is at present planning a  series\r\n\r\nof 13 programmes in all languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndealing  with road safety, including lane  discipline.\r\n\r\nThese  will  be  telecast sometime  between  June  and\r\n\r\nAugust  this  year in support of the  lane  discipline\r\n\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with him that our news reading should\r\n\r\nbe more visualised. In fact, this is being done on TV.\r\n\r\nTherefore, during a Parliamentary report if  the  name\r\n\r\nof  a  Member is mentioned his picture will appear  on\r\n\r\nthe  screen.  But  the normal practice  of  using  map\r\n\r\ngraphic  is to pinpoint the cities or towns  mentioned\r\n\r\nin  the  news. This is not possible for a  very  small\r\n\r\nvillage or town which cannot be located in the  atlas.\r\n\r\nBut  this difficulty is overcome by resorting  to  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  a  cross  to indicate the  last  location  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  a  better known city or town.  At  other\r\n\r\ntimes the RTS have used arrows to pinpoint locations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, background music for the news. Regarding news\r\n\r\nitems, sometimes the time factor has to be considered.\r\n\r\nWhen an important newsreel comes into the hands of our\r\n\r\nproducers they always like to show it on the screen as\r\n\r\nquickly  as  possible. In some cases  it  may  not  be\r\n\r\npossible  for them to locate the appropriate music  to\r\n\r\naccompany  the newsreel. But in any case, I think  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion is a good one and our producers  will  look\r\n\r\nmore closely into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein has spoken on song writing\r\n\r\ncompetition. We are doing our best to popularise songs\r\n\r\ncomposed by Singaporeans for song writing competition.\r\n\r\nI  believe these songs will help develop our  national\r\n\r\nidentity and instil a sense of patriotism in our young\r\n\r\npeople.  We are asking the Ministry of Education,  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association, the SAF Drama and Music  Company\r\n\r\nand  the  Institute of Education to  popularise  these\r\n\r\nsongs.  Moreover, these songs will shortly be  printed\r\n\r\nin   a   booklet  for  distribution  to  schools   and\r\n\r\norganisations. In fact, a local music school has  been\r\n\r\nusing some of these songs for teaching and examination\r\n\r\npurposes. However, given some time we should  be  able\r\n\r\nto build up a repertoire of local music and songs. But\r\n\r\nwe  should  remember that great songs of  the  various\r\n\r\ncountries were not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwritten  overnight.

Member has raised  very  relevant\r\n\r\npoints  regarding the reading of news over television.\r\n\r\nI  am sure most of us would agree that RTS could still\r\n\r\nimprove  on  the  format  of  news  presentation  over\r\n\r\ntelevision. I was thinking, for example, that we could\r\n\r\nencourage  the telecasting of opinions on  major  news\r\n\r\nitems,  Perhaps,  there could be  short  telecasts  of\r\n\r\ndiscussions  on a particular point by local  notables.\r\n\r\nIt  is not a debate. The idea of news presentation  is\r\n\r\nnot  just to say that something has happened.  If  the\r\n\r\nRTS  could try to telecast short excerpts of  opinions\r\n\r\non a particular item, it would be educational and more\r\n\r\nthan just a factual report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> There are newsreels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Newsreels are a separate\r\n\r\nmatter. I have also been considering for some time why\r\n\r\nRTS  needs  to always summarise the news items  before\r\n\r\nthe  news begin and then make a further summary at the\r\n\r\nend of the news. I do not know the rationale for this.\r\n\r\nIf the Minister could consider reviewing this we could\r\n\r\nsave a few seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Kembangan has made some very  good\r\n\r\nsuggestions. But regarding the telecasting of opinions\r\n\r\nby  people  to  accompany the  news,  the  problem  is\r\n\r\nwhether we can get the people to come forward to  give\r\n\r\ntheir  opinions. Local people are reticent on  matters\r\n\r\nconcerning  local affairs. In many  cases  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  for  us to get the right type of  people  to\r\n\r\ncome forward to give their opinions. Especially during\r\n\r\na news telecast, when the news of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmorning  or the day has to be read in the evening,  it\r\n\r\nis  not easy to find immediately the persons belonging\r\n\r\nto   the  relevant  discipline  or  people  who   have\r\n\r\nsomething  to  say  about a certain  subject  to  come\r\n\r\nforward and give their opinions on that subject  which\r\n\r\nis about to be telecast in the news service. But if we\r\n\r\nare  able to find these people, of course, it is  good\r\n\r\nto telecast them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the news summary before and after the\r\n\r\nnews is read is this. This has been the practice for a\r\n\r\nlong time. The summary is to give those who switch  on\r\n\r\nto  the news a little late to know what has been  read\r\n\r\nso  far,  and the summary at the beginning is to  tell\r\n\r\nthem  what  to expect. If from the summary  they  find\r\n\r\nthat  the news would be of no relevance to them,  they\r\n\r\nmay  switch it off. The summary at the end of the news\r\n\r\nis to let them know the news items they have missed if\r\n\r\nthey switch on too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nif  I  may be allowed to comment further. In the first\r\n\r\nplace,  the points summarised before the news  do  not\r\n\r\ncover all the news items being read. They may just  be\r\n\r\ncovering 40% of the news items. So to say that the pre-News  Summary is to enable persons to anticipate  what\r\n\r\nwould be read in the news items does not seem to be  a\r\n\r\ngood explanation as to why the summary is given at the\r\n\r\nbeginning of the news. Secondly, I do not really think\r\n\r\nit  means much to those who came late for the news nor\r\n\r\ndo  I believe that they really benefit by getting  the\r\n\r\nsummary  at the end of the news. I would like  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  I do not suggest in any way that we should  stop\r\n\r\nthe reading of the summary at the beginning and at the\r\n\r\nend of the news. But I think it is good for us to just\r\n\r\nask  what  the rationale is, Even if this has  been  a\r\n\r\nlong  practice, do we really need to continue it? This\r\n\r\nis all I ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nalready  said that it was a summary. Sometimes  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  give  a headline since  it  is  a  news\r\n\r\nservice. The newspapers usually have headlines.  Items\r\n\r\nwhich  are summarised at the beginning and at the  end\r\n\r\nof the news are the more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant  news items and are given headlines.

Most probably  my  picture\r\n\r\nwill  not be shown on the TV tonight. Because I always\r\n\r\nattack  the  RTS, they never show my face. However,  I\r\n\r\nbeg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead CBA 1101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Culture whether\r\n\r\nthere is any in-house system in RTS that evaluates and\r\n\r\nmonitors programmes from the technical angle  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  many instances of technical lapses and unintended\r\n\r\nhumour  will  be  reduced.  Some  examples  of   these\r\n\r\ntechnical lapses have already been mentioned far  more\r\n\r\ndramatically, complete with music, by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah. I think we are all familiar  with  the\r\n\r\nnews  programmes which have been touched upon quite  a\r\n\r\nbit, and with the mistakes that are often presented on\r\n\r\nthe screen, for example, a map of the Middle East when\r\n\r\nthe  headline refers to Vietnam, or the picture of the\r\n\r\nwrong  person  being shown. One of  the  Members  here\r\n\r\nswears  that he once saw, instead of a picture of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Defence, a character  from  the  \"Adam's\r\n\r\nfamily\". I do not know whether .RTS was trying to pass\r\n\r\nsome subtle message to the Minister of Defence, but  I\r\n\r\nthink it was probably another technical lapse. I think\r\n\r\nthere  are  too many technical lapses and an  in-house\r\n\r\nsystem of evaluation and monitoring would help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports telecast is another area where there are\r\n\r\nquite a few lapses. It is a very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopular programme and very often we find that  at  the\r\n\r\nmost  dramatic moment instead of seeing the action  on\r\n\r\nthe field, we see something else. For example, once  I\r\n\r\nsaw  a  hockey  game where Singapore  was  scoring  an\r\n\r\nequalising  goal and instead of seeing the  excitement\r\n\r\nin  front of the goal mouth, I saw the excited picture\r\n\r\nof  the Minister. I think there are some psychologists\r\n\r\nwho  make  it a point to study the reaction of  people\r\n\r\nwatching an event. But I think most of our viewers are\r\n\r\nmore  simple minded and would rather watch the  event.\r\n\r\nSo  I hope that there is some monitoring system and  I\r\n\r\nwould like to hear from the Minister what is happening\r\n\r\non this particular score.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, some of the errors committed\r\n\r\nby   our   TV  producers  and  cameramen  are   purely\r\n\r\naccidental  and not due to a lack of knowledge  or  of\r\n\r\ntraining. Nevertheless, it is my view that the RTS  is\r\n\r\nnow  large enough and sophisticated enough to  justify\r\n\r\nthe setting up of a staff training unit or school. The\r\n\r\ntraining  school  will  enable all  newcomers  to  the\r\n\r\nprofession to receive proper training before they  are\r\n\r\nactually put on the job. At the same time, older hands\r\n\r\ncan  be put through refresher courses to update  ideas\r\n\r\nand techniques from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many national broadcasting stations in this region\r\n\r\nhave broadcasting training centres of their own. It is\r\n\r\nonly in this way that technicians and production staff\r\n\r\ncan  thoroughly  master the tools of their  trade  and\r\n\r\nlearn  how  to use all the sophisticated equipment  to\r\n\r\nthe  best  advantage.  Training  facilities  must   be\r\n\r\nsimilar to but separate from the studios and equipment\r\n\r\nused for the daily output of programmes. To close down\r\n\r\nstudios  for training too often not only disrupts  the\r\n\r\nnormal  flow  of  essential  producion  but  is   also\r\n\r\nuneconomical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it is not the Ministry of Culture that needs to\r\n\r\nbe convinced of the necessity of a training school for\r\n\r\nour broadcasting staff. It is someone else and we will\r\n\r\ntry  to convince them. The time to set up the training\r\n\r\nunit  or centre could not be more opportune than  now.\r\n\r\nWe have the building which was recently vacated by the\r\n\r\nstaff now housed in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  new Radio Centre. We have the redundant black and\r\n\r\nwhite  cameras  and related equipment. Basically,  all\r\n\r\nthat  we need is a small staff to run the school, some\r\n\r\nfunds  to  refurbish  the old building  and  for  some\r\n\r\ninstallation and modification work to be carried  out.\r\n\r\nBut  if we delay this too long, the cameras which  are\r\n\r\nat  present  serviceable will through disuse  rust  to\r\n\r\nsuch  an  extent that they may eventually have  to  be\r\n\r\nwritten off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, training is carried out on an ad hoc\r\n\r\nbasis  and while the trainee is in service and on  the\r\n\r\njob.  Some of the key members of the production  staff\r\n\r\nhave  been  sent  to  stations  and  training  centres\r\n\r\noverseas  to  upgrade their knowledge  and  learn  the\r\n\r\nlatest techniques, particularly in colour. Upon  their\r\n\r\nreturn  these  officers run sessions for the  recruits\r\n\r\nand  others who need training. But all this has to  be\r\n\r\ndone  in  addition  to  the  senior  officers'  normal\r\n\r\nproduction and supervisory duties. From time to  time.\r\n\r\nRTS also obtains the services of experts from overseas\r\n\r\nthrough  the Colombo Plan scheme to carry out training\r\n\r\nsessions.  For the duration of these sessions,  normal\r\n\r\nproduction facilities and studios have to be  diverted\r\n\r\nfor training purposes. Until such time as the proposal\r\n\r\nfor a training school is approved, I am afraid we will\r\n\r\nhave   to   tolerate  this  unsatisfactory  situation.\r\n\r\nHowever,  as I have said before, most of these  errors\r\n\r\nand mistakes are of an accidental nature. This is most\r\n\r\nnoticeable in a programme which is telecast live, such\r\n\r\nas  the  news.  But in a pre-recorded programme  where\r\n\r\nthere is opportunity for rehearsing and editing, these\r\n\r\nerrors are not so common.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, does the Hon.

Although   CEPTA   is   orientated   towards\r\n\r\neducational  TV, still the techniques are similar  and\r\n\r\nthere   could  be  some  economies  derived   out   of\r\n\r\ncollaboration in this respect between the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture and the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, CEPTA is devoting more time\r\n\r\nto  educational TV, and therefore I think it is unfair\r\n\r\nto  expect  CEPTA to spend some of its  time  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining of our technicians or our producers.  In  any\r\n\r\ncase  CEPTA has been of service to us, but I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink it is a solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's\r\n\r\nexplanation, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead FAA 1101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I love to go to the Museum. I have been to the\r\n\r\nNational  Museum many times. But, until very recently,\r\n\r\nthe exhibits seem to be the same as they were 20 years\r\n\r\nago.  In the last couple of years there seemed  to  be\r\n\r\nsome changes. I saw that money was being spent, and  I\r\n\r\nthought we were going to see something fantastic.  But\r\n\r\nall  that I can see is that the old exhibits have been\r\n\r\nrearranged. They put the exhibits in different places,\r\n\r\ntrying  to  confuse  the  public,  but  with   a   few\r\n\r\nadditions. Nothing much. I am interested to  see  what\r\n\r\nthe  countries around us are like, what their  histroy\r\n\r\nis like, what happened during the Stone age in Malaya.\r\n\r\netc.  But  I  regret to say that there is  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nexhibits purely of Singapore origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160 years ago Singapore was rediscovered. Before\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore existed, so it was never  founded.  It\r\n\r\nwas rediscovered. There is a lot of history before and\r\n\r\nafter  this  period. And yet when  people  go  to  the\r\n\r\nMuseum  they  see  nothing very much about  Singapore.\r\n\r\nVisitors to the Museum expect to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsee  a  potted history of our country and yet they  do\r\n\r\nnot see any. When they go to the Museum, they want  to\r\n\r\nknow  who built Singapore. Personalities who are  well\r\n\r\nknown  in Singapore should be highlighted. And  so  do\r\n\r\nour  cultures. We are mainly of immigrant  stock.  Our\r\n\r\nforefathers came from various countries.  Why  can  we\r\n\r\nnot  show  in our Museum what Singapore was like  when\r\n\r\nour  Chinese, Indian, Malay or Arab forefathers  came?\r\n\r\nHow they were dressed, their hairstyles, customs, life-styles,  and traditions. These are valuable  reminders\r\n\r\nto our present Nouveau Riche, the new rich generation,\r\n\r\nof  the humble and hard beginnings of our forefathers.\r\n\r\nThis   will  encourage  a  sense  of  pride   in   our\r\n\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure many people do not really know that\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  really much smaller than  what  it  is\r\n\r\ntoday.  Reclamation was not done only in the  last  15\r\n\r\nyears or so. There were reclamations even before that,\r\n\r\nlike Beach Road which was actually sited on the beach.\r\n\r\nSuch items in our Museum can tell what it was like  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  Singapore. We could show the wild  animals  in\r\n\r\nthose  days, like tigers, wild boars, roaming on  this\r\n\r\nisland. We can show visitors what Singapore was before\r\n\r\nand what it is now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to read about the local content of the\r\n\r\nSecond  World  War, and I find that all  the  colonial\r\n\r\npowers, the mak salehs, get all the publicity of  what\r\n\r\nthey did during the war. There was very little written\r\n\r\nabout our own people. How about the Museum telling us,\r\n\r\nand  showing  exhibits  of what actually  happened  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  during  the  war?  There  were  the   local\r\n\r\ncelebrities,  and the legal system. We  can  show  our\r\n\r\nfamous  leaders, judges, lawyers, what they  did,  and\r\n\r\nthe  various  personalities who have helped  to  build\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the big Chinese towkays who  created  this\r\n\r\ncountry. All these are not being shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When students studying Singapore history go to our\r\n\r\nNational  Museum,  they should be able  after  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  visits to assimilate the knowledge of the whole\r\n\r\nhistory of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now, if someone goes there, he learns nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again tourists and floating population can get a\r\n\r\nlook  at Singapore in microcosom - everything for  them\r\n\r\nto  see, the growth of Singapore, how it grew  from  a\r\n\r\nvillage  into a city.

So it is not  correct  to\r\n\r\nsay  that the displays in the National Museum are  all\r\n\r\nthe  same throughout the year. The National Museum Art\r\n\r\nGallery which was officially opened on the 21st August\r\n\r\nlast  year  has held art exhibitions continuously.  So\r\n\r\nhas the Young People's Gallery which is devoted mainly\r\n\r\nto  student  art.  In  addition, the  three  renovated\r\n\r\ngallery  rooms  for the University  of  Singapore  art\r\n\r\ncollection were opened to the public in the middle  of\r\n\r\nMarch  last  year. On the ground floor,  the  National\r\n\r\nMuseum  has  displays pertaining  to  the  history  of\r\n\r\nSingapore from the period of Temasek to the 1930s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the final phase renovation of the National\r\n\r\nMuseum  there are plans to provide a gallery  for  the\r\n\r\nchronological history of Singapore and another gallery\r\n\r\nto  illustrate the growth and development of Singapore\r\n\r\nCity.  Even now the displays in the old galleries  are\r\n\r\nchanged  from time to time. For example, a display  of\r\n\r\nthe costumes, garments, tapestries and other artifacts\r\n\r\nused\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  Straits Chinese of Singapore in the 19th  and\r\n\r\n20th centuries has just ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Museum is worth many visits in the\r\n\r\nyear, especially for its exhibitions. At least 262,000\r\n\r\npeople  visited  the  National  Museum  in  the   last\r\n\r\nfinancial year. What the Member wants to see seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  an increased number of exhibits, but this can only\r\n\r\nbe  acquired in time. But if there are no  new  museum\r\n\r\npieces  discovered, how can we create  them?  We  have\r\n\r\nalready  dug up the whole of Singapore as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  urban renewal development, but so far we have not\r\n\r\ncome  up with anything worth exhibiting in our Museum.\r\n\r\nI am sure if there are, they would have been exhibited\r\n\r\nin our Museum. The stuffed animals have all been taken\r\n\r\nover  by  the Singapore Science Council. I am sure  he\r\n\r\nwill  find  them  there. It is not  possible  to  have\r\n\r\nseveral  museums in Singapore because  it  is  already\r\n\r\nquite difficult to keep up with just one museum. I  am\r\n\r\nsure  we  do not have the resources to keep more  than\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, just a point of information.\r\n\r\nThere  are a number of museums already. There are  the\r\n\r\nArts  and  Anthropology  Museum,  the  Science  Centre\r\n\r\nMuseum and the Sentosa Maritime and Gun Museum. We are\r\n\r\nquite  well  stocked with museums.  Perhaps  I  should\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  the Minister for Culture that he  revives\r\n\r\nthe  Advisory Committee that used to help him with the\r\n\r\nMuseum.  The Member for Telok Blangah could be invited\r\n\r\nto  be a member of this Committee. I remember I was  a\r\n\r\nmember of this Committee at one time but after we have\r\n\r\nfinished  our  work  the  Minister  closed  down   the\r\n\r\nCommittee.  This  reminds me of the Malay  expression:\r\n\r\nLepas jambatan buang tongkat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I go to the Museum very often.\r\n\r\nI  am  aware of the various art exhibitions  and  that\r\n\r\nthere have been improvements. But what I am saying  is\r\n\r\nthat  the improvement is just a redistribution of  the\r\n\r\nold exhibits. I remember what it was 20 years ago, and\r\n\r\nnow  I see it is the same one redistributed. There was\r\n\r\nthe  nyonya exhibit. I went to see the nyonya  exhibit\r\n\r\nand all the art exhibits.

And that  is  what  my\r\n\r\nchildren  and other people's children and the students\r\n\r\nwant to see. They do not want to see exhibits one at a\r\n\r\ntime.  Do you expect everybody to go and see just  the\r\n\r\nnyonya  clothes? Not every one in Singapore  could  go\r\n\r\nand  see  the exhibit four or five times a year.  They\r\n\r\nmay be able to go there only once or twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I had the fortune or\r\n\r\nmisfortune  to  serve  in the same  Committee  as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Katong. The Member for Telok Blangah  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  Museum  appeared to be nothing  new  but  a\r\n\r\nrearrangement of exhibits. The Museum has  been  there\r\n\r\nfor many years and the arrangement was there for those\r\n\r\nmany  years that it only conformed to the old display\r\n\r\ntechnique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I understand is that the Museum is now\r\n\r\nundergoing renovation to upgrade and update itself  in\r\n\r\nthe  style,  manner and artistic display of  the  very\r\n\r\nvaluable exhibits. Maybe the Member for Telok  Blangah\r\n\r\nis  under the misconception that it is a simple  means\r\n\r\nto  deceive  the public. I can assure the Member  that\r\n\r\nbeing quite associated with the Museum myself, that is\r\n\r\nnot  the case, First, it has to get itself geared  up,\r\n\r\nupdate  itself and then we can talk about  whether  or\r\n\r\nnot we should have a department to show the history of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But  now  and then, exhibitions  like  the\r\n\r\nnyonya  dress and so on will highlight one  particular\r\n\r\naspect  of  the  history  of Singapore  and  that  the\r\n\r\ncumulative  effect will give us a better indepth  than\r\n\r\njust  walking into the Museum and declare that \"I have\r\n\r\nemerged  from  the history of Singapore.\"  It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  at this stage to put everything together  in\r\n\r\nthe  very constricted area of the National Museum.  If\r\n\r\nthe Member for Telok Blangah spends three hours in the\r\n\r\nMuseum  and declares that \"I have been to the Museum\",\r\n\r\nI  think he is not being honest with himself. That  is\r\n\r\nnot  the way to see a museum. I will have to spend  at\r\n\r\nleast  one week if I want to understand every  exhibit\r\n\r\nin our Museum alone.

Firstly, in the past one year I have  found\r\n\r\nthat  the Film Censorship Board has not been stringent\r\n\r\nin  its  censorship of films. They  have  become  more\r\n\r\nliberal  in  their  censorship, resulting  in  certain\r\n\r\nundesirable films being screened in the cinemas,  such\r\n\r\nas  those violent, phantasmic, nonsensical and obscene\r\n\r\nfilms.  All  these undesirable films are having  their\r\n\r\nway in Singapore and are causing an adverse effect  on\r\n\r\nour   people,  particularly  the  youths.   They   are\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the welfare of our youths. We know that\r\n\r\nour youths are still in their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nformative  years and are susceptible to all  sorts  of\r\n\r\nbad  influences. These undesirable films will lead our\r\n\r\nyouths  astray and degenerate. This is very dangerous.\r\n\r\nFor   example, those  nonsensical,  obscene  or   sex\r\n\r\npictures will influence the youths to tease or  molest\r\n\r\nwomen  and  girls even in public. Other films  are  so\r\n\r\nphantasmic   and  monstrous  that  will   kindle   the\r\n\r\nsuperstitions of the audience. Some action  films  are\r\n\r\nvery  violent and bloody in certain scenes. All  these\r\n\r\nwill leave an indelible influence and will cause a lot\r\n\r\nof harm to our people, particularly our youths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there has been a continued manifestation\r\n\r\nof  such bad trends in our society. We can find  from\r\n\r\nthe  statistics of the Health Ministry that there  are\r\n\r\nyouths  both  boys and girls under 14 years  who  have\r\n\r\ncontracted  VD and the number of juvenile  delinquency\r\n\r\ncases  is  increasing  year  by  year.  We  have   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to provide a healthy  environment  for\r\n\r\nour  people  to  live and grow in.  Ours  is  a  young\r\n\r\ncountry. About 60% of our population is under 21 years\r\n\r\nold.  They are our priceless asset. Whether they  grow\r\n\r\nup  healthily or degenerate into a decadent generation\r\n\r\nwill  affect the future of our country. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  neglect this aspect of  our  affairs.  We\r\n\r\nshould consider this matter seriously and impose a ban\r\n\r\non all such undesirable films. I hope the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture  and  his  officials will  persuade  the  film\r\n\r\ndistributors  and  agents to buy  only  those  healthy\r\n\r\nfilms  with  educational significance  for  screening,\r\n\r\notherwise  they  would  not be approved  by  the  Film\r\n\r\nCensorship  Board. Since cinema films  enjoy  a  large\r\n\r\naudience,  business  must be very lucrative,  and  the\r\n\r\nfilm  distributors and agents can buy and  show  those\r\n\r\ngood films and still make a profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: in the past one year how\r\n\r\nmany  films were banned from public screening and what\r\n\r\ncategories  did they belong to? What were the  reasons\r\n\r\nfor banning such films?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I have listened with great\r\n\r\nadmiration and interest to the Member for Sembawang on\r\n\r\nhis views\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregarding film censorship. However, I thought it would\r\n\r\nbe  fair  for me to stand up and perhaps moderate  his\r\n\r\nenthusiasm to censor films to the extent that  he  has\r\n\r\nadvocated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that films that blatantly advocate sex,\r\n\r\nviolence, crimes, political or racial overtones should\r\n\r\nbe  banned  without hesitation. What I am saying  here\r\n\r\nis,  in  effect, that if censorship is to be exercised\r\n\r\nit   should  be  exercised  cleverly.  If   the   Film\r\n\r\nCensorship  Board  decides to cut parts  away  from  a\r\n\r\nfilm,  this should not be overdone to the extent  that\r\n\r\nthe  film loses its artistic content completely,  that\r\n\r\nit  is disjointed and the language becomes incoherent.\r\n\r\nIf  such  deletions  of a film are  necessary,  a  ban\r\n\r\nshould be imposed totally, and not reducing a two-hour\r\n\r\nfilm  to  just one hour. I think the public deserve  a\r\n\r\nbetter treatment. The public should not be cheated  by\r\n\r\nthe distributors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to add here,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that the Film Censorship Board must  realise\r\n\r\nthat different films cater to different sectors of the\r\n\r\npopulation. Therefore, in a sense, films that  may  be\r\n\r\nacceptable  to  one sector may not  be  acceptable  to\r\n\r\nanother.  I know that arising from this argument  that\r\n\r\nthere   could  be  conflicting  interest   and   hence\r\n\r\ndifficulty in terms of allowing certain films through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note with great interest that recently a\r\n\r\ncertain film called \"One flew over the cuckoo's  nest\"\r\n\r\nwas  allowed. I think this film was allowed  after  an\r\n\r\nappeal and a certain amount of publicity was given  in\r\n\r\nthe  press.  I  personally would like to  applaud  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture for allowing this film  to  come\r\n\r\nthrough  because there are many factors which one  has\r\n\r\nto  consider in exercising the axe. I wish to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister that with the passing of that film,  does  it\r\n\r\ntherefore indicate that the Film Censorship  Board  is\r\n\r\nnow  undergoing  a  period of  liberalisation  of  its\r\n\r\nattitude or approach towards film censorship,  or  was\r\n\r\nthe film allowed purely because of press agitation?  I\r\n\r\nmust  confess  that since that film was allowed  there\r\n\r\nwere  many  other  interesting films which  have  been\r\n\r\nshown in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncinemas  and, in fact, over Television Singapore.  The\r\n\r\npublic  has  responded very favourably. I  notice  the\r\n\r\nlanguage   is   free   and   simple   with   lots   of\r\n\r\nmonosyllables, words which we commonly use  and  hear.\r\n\r\nAnd  the bare facts of life made barer and the  beauty\r\n\r\nof  body and flesh given display in its full glory. In\r\n\r\na sense, it is a refreshing change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come back to the point regarding the different\r\n\r\nsectors  that  films cater. Would it not be  possible,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  for  the Ministry of Culture  to  consider\r\n\r\nclassification of films? If the Film Censorship  Board\r\n\r\nfeels  that a certain sector of the population  should\r\n\r\nnot   see   these   movies  they  can  be   classified\r\n\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a final comment, I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\nenlighten  this House as to the banning of  a  certain\r\n\r\nfilm about the episode at Entebbe Airport, a film that\r\n\r\nI  thought  depicted  victory of resolve  over  bully,\r\n\r\ndiscipline over madness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not\r\n\r\neasy  to  please everyone. The Member for Kim Seng  is\r\n\r\nhappy to see some relaxation in censorship but, on the\r\n\r\nother hand, the Member for Sembawang deplores this and\r\n\r\nis  sad  to  see such relaxation. Films  is  always  a\r\n\r\npopular  topic for debate and it is perhaps  the  most\r\n\r\npopular entertainment for Singaporeans and it is  also\r\n\r\na profitable commodity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Film producers will produce films that can draw\r\n\r\ncrowds, and  after some time when a certain  type  of\r\n\r\nfilm  has  lost  its  attraction,  they  will  produce\r\n\r\nsomething else. So you have films on the supernatural,\r\n\r\nghosts,  vampires,  and  so on.  But  such  films  are\r\n\r\ngenerally  unrealistic  and they  provide  a  kind  of\r\n\r\nescape  for the ordinary people and nobody  will  take\r\n\r\nthem  seriously.  To prohibit the exhibition  of  such\r\n\r\nfilms  would be an exaggeration of their influence  on\r\n\r\nthe  cinema goers. We have had our days when  we  were\r\n\r\nyoung.  We  all grew up in the days when  these  films\r\n\r\nwere  popular, but it does not mean that  we  are  all\r\n\r\nghost-fearing  or  vampire-fearing people.  It  really\r\n\r\ndoes  not  affect us at all. Even then all  the  films\r\n\r\nportraying the supernatural and those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepicting  sex are carefully scrutinised before  they\r\n\r\nare allowed public exhibition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Government does not import or\r\n\r\nproduce  films,  we are not in a position  to  select\r\n\r\nfilms  for  the people. I think it is also unwise  to\r\n\r\ntell  the exhibitors that they should show or  import\r\n\r\nonly  a  certain  type of film. On the  contrary,  we\r\n\r\nshould encourage the cinemas to show as many types of\r\n\r\nfilms  as  possible so that the people have a  better\r\n\r\nchoice of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards young people indulging in sex, I do not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  because  of films.  Sex  comes  to  us\r\n\r\nnaturally. I do not think it is because of films that\r\n\r\ncause  these  people to indulge in sexual activities.\r\n\r\nThe Member for Sembawang wants to know the number  of\r\n\r\nfilms  banned  last year. The number of films  banned\r\n\r\nlast  year  is  73.  Forty of them  glorified  crime.\r\n\r\nviolence, gangsterism or drug addiction; 23 were  sex\r\n\r\nexploitative or morally objectionable; 9 were  banned\r\n\r\nfor  political reasons; and one on religious grounds.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  correct to say that we are relaxing  our\r\n\r\ncriteria  on film censorship. It has always been  our\r\n\r\npolicy  to  see that films shown in our  cinemas  are\r\n\r\ndecent, healthy and of good taste. But the judging of\r\n\r\na  film differs very widely from person to person and\r\n\r\nalso  from time to time. It is very difficult to  lay\r\n\r\ndown  in  detail  whether a  particular  scene  or  a\r\n\r\nparticular  word should or should not be allowed  and\r\n\r\ntherefore   we  have  this  kind  of  difference   in\r\n\r\ntreatment. Very often, a film has to be judged in its\r\n\r\nentirety  before a decision is made as to  whether  a\r\n\r\nparticular  scene  should be  cut.  No,  we  are  not\r\n\r\nrelaxing  our  censorship on films. Perhaps  you  can\r\n\r\ndescribe what you are seeing as a more sensible or  a\r\n\r\nmore  enlightening approach in film  censorship.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  a film is cut, care is always taken to see that\r\n\r\ncuts are not noticeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the classification of films, we have\r\n\r\nconsidered this matter. If I remember correctly, when\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Katong came to this House he was  the\r\n\r\nfirst  to raise this matter. We have considered  this\r\n\r\nand our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeeling  is that it is not a very good idea  to  have\r\n\r\nfilm    classification.   If   we   do   have    film\r\n\r\nclassification then there should be a  lot  of  films\r\n\r\nwhich are of artistic value but which cannot be shown\r\n\r\nto  the  younger population. But unfortunately  there\r\n\r\nare  not so many of this kind of films. Most  of  the\r\n\r\nfilms that are supposed to be rated X are actually on\r\n\r\nsex   exploitation.   It  is  more   an   erotic   or\r\n\r\npornographic film than an ordinary film  made  in  an\r\n\r\nartistic  way.  So there is really  no  advantage  in\r\n\r\nhaving  film classification in Singapore  because  we\r\n\r\nwould  then have a lot of films coming into Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  are of no value at all. If the Member for  Kim\r\n\r\nSeng  has been overseas - I am sure he has - he would\r\n\r\nknow that in most of the cinemas in Europe or the USA\r\n\r\nwhere  X  films  are  shown, in many  instances,  the\r\n\r\ncinemas are practically empty. So you can see that if\r\n\r\nwe do have classification in Singapore, after a while\r\n\r\nI  am  sure our cinemas will also be empty after  the\r\n\r\npeople  get  tired of them. This would  really  be  a\r\n\r\nwaste of the facilities. It would be a better idea to\r\n\r\nlet  them  show decent films and films which  are  of\r\n\r\ngood  taste so that everyone, not only the grown-ups,\r\n\r\ncan enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of the film which was banned it is\r\n\r\nentitled \"The Raid on Entebbe Airport\". It was banned\r\n\r\non  political  grounds. Because of the representation\r\n\r\nmade  by  certain  embassies in  Singapore  and  also\r\n\r\nbecause of other considerations, we have decided that\r\n\r\nit should be banned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just\r\n\r\nwant  to clarify or rebut one point.

In  the  Addendum  to  the\r\n\r\nPresidential Address at the opening of this Session of\r\n\r\nthe  Fourth  Parliament, the Minister for Culture  has\r\n\r\nstated, and I quote [Hansard, Vol 36, cols 42 - 3]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Apart from sponsoring competitions, exhibitions and\r\n\r\nperformances, the Ministry will provide financial  and\r\n\r\nother   forms  of  assistance  to  deserving   amateur\r\n\r\ncultural groups.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  in the light of his remarks I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister the following questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, why is there a reduction from $186,500 for FY\r\n\r\n76  to  only $10,000 for FY 77?

Sir,  the\r\n\r\nbudget  here  is not in line with the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture as spelt out in the Addendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to inform the hon. Member for Delta that the  sum\r\n\r\nearmarked  for  contribution to cultural organisations\r\n\r\nhas   always  been  $10,000.  Although  the  provision\r\n\r\nappears to be higher in some years the additional fund\r\n\r\nwas   actually  meant  for  renovation  work  to   our\r\n\r\ntheatres.  For  example, in  FY  76  out  of  $186,500\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the  subhead,  $176,500  was  used   for\r\n\r\nrewiring  and installation of fire fighting  equipment\r\n\r\nat  the  National Theatre. The balance of $10,000  was\r\n\r\nused  for  contributions  to  cultural  organisations.\r\n\r\nThere is no reduction in the provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three criteria are used for approving grants. The\r\n\r\norganisations applying for the grant should be active.\r\n\r\nThe   project   should  have  some   merit   and   the\r\n\r\norganisation is in need of financial support. In  1976\r\n\r\ngrants were given to the National Junior College Drama\r\n\r\nSociety,  the  National Theatre Club, the Experimental\r\n\r\nTheatre  Club, the Nanyang Academy of Fine  Arts,  the\r\n\r\nAlumni  Association,  Sri  Warna, the  National  Book\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Council and the Stage Club. The  National\r\n\r\nTheatre   Club  was  given  a  grant  of  $5,000   for\r\n\r\norganising  a  wide  range of  activities.  Grants  of\r\n\r\nbetween $500 and $1,000 were made to the other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisations to assist them in carrying  out  various\r\n\r\ncultural  activities, including the staging  of  plays\r\n\r\nand   cultural   shows,  organising  a   workshop   on\r\n\r\nbibliographical  standards and an art exhibition.

Under the Medicines  Act,  one  of  the\r\n\r\nfunctions   of   this   department   is   to   provide\r\n\r\nmicrobiological testing of pharmaceutical products for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health as well as the private sector.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that this department caters mainly for\r\n\r\nthe Health Ministry. What about its functions to other\r\n\r\nMinistries?  I feel that this Department  should  also\r\n\r\nextend its services to the other Ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as part\r\n\r\nof its efforts to promote scientific and technological\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   the   Ministry   encourages    research\r\n\r\nactivities by local researchers both in Government and\r\n\r\nin  the  tertiary institutions through  the  award  of\r\n\r\nresearch  grants. Such grants are awarded for research\r\n\r\non  selected topics which are beneficial and  relevant\r\n\r\nto  our  needs.  Besides studies  on  energy  sources,\r\n\r\nresearch   grants  have  been  provided  for  research\r\n\r\nprojects  in other fields such as engineering studies,\r\n\r\npollution   control,  applied  chemistry,   biological\r\n\r\nstudies and on technological\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of specific industries.

Utilisation  of  solar  energy   for   air-conditioning  and  refrigeration,  though  technically\r\n\r\nfeasible,   will   not   be  an  economically   viable\r\n\r\nproposition.  Similarly, in the case of the  study  of\r\n\r\nwind  energy, it was found that it may be possible  to\r\n\r\nutilise  wind energy for the production of electricity\r\n\r\non  a  small scale to power light beacons but the wind\r\n\r\nforce  was not strong enough for any large scale power\r\n\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training of local personnel in foreign countries\r\n\r\nis  in  general  coordinated  by  the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission.

Briefly\r\n\r\nhe  has  the  duty initially to help those unfortunate\r\n\r\npeople in our society. Therefore, to be a Minister for\r\n\r\nSocial Affairs, the first condition is not whether one\r\n\r\ncan  do  it or capable or not capable but whether  one\r\n\r\nhas  sympathy. Sir, after these few years I have  come\r\n\r\nto  this  conclusion.  I feel that  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs is one without sympathy.  To  be  more\r\n\r\nfrank,  I feel that he is a bit like what the  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying  says,  \"One  with  a  stony  heart.\"  To  many\r\n\r\nunfortunate  events in the society he has always  been\r\n\r\nlethargic.  If  we read the newspapers we  can  always\r\n\r\nfind  that  there  are reports of  frequent  tragedies\r\n\r\ntaking  place  in  our  society.  Just  as  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said, if you do not  read  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nnewspapers, you do not understand what is happening in\r\n\r\nour   society.   We   have  frequently   come   across\r\n\r\nunfortunate  incidents  happening  suddenly  to   some\r\n\r\nfamilies, the breadwinner of a family suddenly meeting\r\n\r\nwith some tragedy, being killed at worksite or due  to\r\n\r\nsome  other events, so that members of the family  are\r\n\r\nleft alone, high and dry. Overnight, the old and young\r\n\r\nare  left  helpless, with their livelihood going  from\r\n\r\nbad  to  worse.  So;  has  the  Government  taken  any\r\n\r\nimmediate practical steps to help such people? No,  to\r\n\r\nbe  frank.  Not only this, the HDB has also threatened\r\n\r\nto evict them because of arrears in rental and the PUB\r\n\r\nhas  also  threatened  to  take  action  against  them\r\n\r\nbecause of arrears in payment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  PUB supplies. Recently, there was an unprecedented\r\n\r\ntragedy  of  a family, a widow and her daughter.  They\r\n\r\nburnt  themselves to death in an HDB flat  because  of\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  looking for any means  of  livelihood.\r\n\r\nDoes the Minister know about this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often local newspapers, particularly the\r\n\r\nChinese  newspapers, have been  taking  the  lead  in\r\n\r\norganising relief to help such people. This is done as\r\n\r\npart of their social duty to render good services. All\r\n\r\nalong, the  response from members of the  public  has\r\n\r\nbeen spontaneous. Many people have donated generously,\r\n\r\nmany anonymously. Only our Social Affairs Ministry  is\r\n\r\napathetic  to such social tragedies. Normally,  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  Government that should take the lead. But it  now\r\n\r\nappears  that the Ministry of Social Affairs seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  taking the attitude that such tragedies are merely\r\n\r\nsome  isolated  family tragedies and  it  is  not  the\r\n\r\nbusiness of the Ministry. I think it is the Ministry's\r\n\r\nduty. The officers concerned also should not just work\r\n\r\nto  rule  and  be  contented with merely  engaging  in\r\n\r\ninvestigation  and doling out some  little  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney  to such victims, and that is all. There  should\r\n\r\nbe  a  contingency `und to meet such a  situation.  If\r\n\r\nsuch  a tragedy happens, the Ministry concerned should\r\n\r\nimmediately take action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been talking about the traditional good\r\n\r\nvirtues of Eastern people. Let me point out one  which\r\n\r\nis  to look after the orphans and widows and to render\r\n\r\nthem assistance. This is the usual expectation on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment by Oriental people. Why is the TV programme\r\n\r\nPao  Ching Tien, that is Justice Pao, so very popular?\r\n\r\nIt  is  because we Orientals all look up to him to  be\r\n\r\nnot  only  just, but also humane and with warmth.  Our\r\n\r\nMinister  for Social Affairs obviously cannot  measure\r\n\r\nup  to  the  stature of Justice Pao but  at  least  he\r\n\r\nshould  take the lead in this matter. The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs should initiate relief action in  such\r\n\r\ncases at least negotiate with the HDB or the PUB to be\r\n\r\nmore  flexible in dealing with such unfortunate people\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould not leave it to the Members of Parliament alone\r\n\r\nto take up this responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I  do not quite agree  with  what  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Boon Lay has said - that our Minister  is\r\n\r\n\"one  with  a  stony  heart\".

On the matter  of\r\n\r\nproviding welfare care for the aged, I know  that  the\r\n\r\ndepartment concerned has been encouraging civic mutual\r\n\r\naid  organisations to set up small scale homes for the\r\n\r\naged  to accommodate destitute old people. This  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  move. I feel that these civic organisations  are\r\n\r\nvery willing to take up part of the responsibility  in\r\n\r\nlooking  after the old and the destitute. But  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  many  civic  organisations are  not  quite  able\r\n\r\nfinancially  to  take up the entire  burden  for  this\r\n\r\ntask.  In order to carry out their work, there is  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  substantial amounts of  money  to  buy  the\r\n\r\nnecessary equipment and the facilities required.  Also\r\n\r\nthere is the need for a constant source of finance  to\r\n\r\nmeet recurrent expenditure. So I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he  will consider  allocating  some\r\n\r\nfunds   as   allowance  to  assist  those   mutual-aid\r\n\r\norganisations which run homes for the aged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in order to assist the livelihood of the\r\n\r\naged, will   the  Minister  consider   raising   the\r\n\r\nretirement age? At present it is at 55 years. Although\r\n\r\nsome  people  have  reached 55 they  are  still  quite\r\n\r\nhealthy physically; because of the changing times.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past, people who lived up to 70 years  old  were\r\n\r\nrare. Nowadays the situation is different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere  are  many people who have reached 70 years  and\r\n\r\nare   still  healthy.  So  we  should  reconsider  the\r\n\r\nretiring age. Maybe the Minister says that it  is  not\r\n\r\nunder his portfolio but a matter for the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  to  decide.  But I say  he  could  start  of!\r\n\r\nsomething  in  this  respect in  his  department.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  can  take the lead in doing something  about\r\n\r\nhis department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the question of the aged has aroused the\r\n\r\ninterest of the public. In order to enable those  aged\r\n\r\npeople  who  have  contributed to our  society  to  be\r\n\r\ntreated and looked after better. I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  the Ministry concerned will start a  campaign\r\n\r\nto  respect and love the old people and to  teach  and\r\n\r\ninstil  a  sense  of respect for the  aged  among  our\r\n\r\nyounger generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nthe previous Members have spoken regarding allowances.\r\n\r\nI  am  going to speak on sports. I spoke about it last\r\n\r\nyear  and  I  am going to speak on sports  again  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all agreed that the objective of sports\r\n\r\npromotion  in  Singapore is the mass participation  of\r\n\r\nour  people  in  sports. This is more  important  than\r\n\r\nproducing champions. But then we must at the same time\r\n\r\ntry  our best to improve the standard of our sportsmen\r\n\r\nand   sportswomen.  This  is  evidently  seen  in  the\r\n\r\nselection of the Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year\r\n\r\nas  it appears that there is no keen competition  from\r\n\r\nthe  various sports associations for this annual grand\r\n\r\ntitle  during  the last few years. However,  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhat  encouragement and incentives are  given  by  the\r\n\r\nvarious sports associations and Government leaders  to\r\n\r\nour  stars  who  represent our State for international\r\n\r\nmeets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in most cases, very little\r\n\r\nencouragement  and  incentives  are  provided  by  the\r\n\r\nsports  associations  for  our  players.  Many   State\r\n\r\nplayers  from  the  various sports  associations  have\r\n\r\nmentioned that in some instances the officials of  the\r\n\r\nassociations  do  not give proper guidance  and  moral\r\n\r\nsupport  which  they  are  supposed  to  give  to  the\r\n\r\nplayers. I believe the main problem is finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the Football Association of Singapore which is\r\n\r\nnow  more or less financially stable, the other sports\r\n\r\nassociations need adequate financial backing.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nsponsorship  by  various firms could  be  a  solution.\r\n\r\nPotential  players who represent the State  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  incentives  like time-off for  more  meaningful\r\n\r\ncentralised    training,   sports    aids,    monetary\r\n\r\nincentives, participating in more international  meets\r\n\r\nand even more newspaper publicity for encouragement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the present Chairman of the Singapore Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil  and since he took over the administration  of\r\n\r\nthe SSC he has got a proper control of the Council. He\r\n\r\nhimself makes it a point to check and attends  to  all\r\n\r\nmatters pertaining to sports. This is remarkable.  But\r\n\r\nthen  the  SSC  has got no control on  the  individual\r\n\r\nsports   associations  which  are  supposed  to   give\r\n\r\nencouragement to their members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister himself is a keen supporter of sports.\r\n\r\nSir,  you can see him attending many sports functions.\r\n\r\nHe  is at the National Stadium to support our national\r\n\r\nsoccer  team  whenever the team is in action.  He  too\r\n\r\nshould  be praised for the interest shown. However,  I\r\n\r\nhope  that he would use his good offices to  see  that\r\n\r\nthe players are properly treated and that the standard\r\n\r\nof the game is improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Stadium is no longer a \"white\r\n\r\nelephant\" as it once was. We now regularly hear of the\r\n\r\n\"Kallang Roar\" of the soccer fans. Perhaps it  is  the\r\n\r\nroar  of  the capacity crowds which may have  produced\r\n\r\nthe  cracks in the structure of the Stadium. May I ask\r\n\r\nwhat  is being done to minimise the danger that  these\r\n\r\ncracks present? There is a craze by most Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nboth  male and female, to support our national  soccer\r\n\r\nteam  in  action at the National Stadium.  The  paying\r\n\r\ncrowd  numbering thousands come out in full  force  to\r\n\r\ncheer our national team. This is indeed remarkable and\r\n\r\nbecause of our local support, our players' performance\r\n\r\ntoo is glorifying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a need to discipline some of our\r\n\r\nlocal fans. In the recent World\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCup  series, the fans played their part very  well  in\r\n\r\ncheering the teams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police has now formed a permanent unit of\r\n\r\nhundreds  of National Servicemen under the  charge  of\r\n\r\nthe Reserve Unit to control the crowd. But then during\r\n\r\nsome  of the matches of the Malaysia Cup series,  even\r\n\r\nthe police had some problems in controlling the crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were occasions when some mischief makers threw\r\n\r\nmissiles  onto  the pitch, onto the  players  and  the\r\n\r\nreferee. This I think should be definitely stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheering and booing is a common thing in sports\r\n\r\nwhich is acceptable. But the throwing of missiles onto\r\n\r\nthe  field is a very dangerous act and is not  healthy\r\n\r\nin  the light of sports promotion, though the fans may\r\n\r\nshow their colours here. But what would be the fate of\r\n\r\nour innocent players when they go for return games?  A\r\n\r\ntypical example is the match against Pahang last  year\r\n\r\nwhich  should  be a lesson to our local fans,  I  also\r\n\r\nnote  that  some  of our mischievous  fans  boo,  pass\r\n\r\nuncalled  remarks  and spit at some  of  the  visiting\r\n\r\nplayers when they are leaving the stadium. This is, in\r\n\r\nfact,  not healthy. I therefore suggest some  sort  of\r\n\r\nstrict measures be introduced like banning some of the\r\n\r\noffenders from entering the stadium for sometime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the grounds outside the National Stadium still\r\n\r\nseem  unsafe despite my pointing this out a few  years\r\n\r\nago. Too many accidents have occurred, particularly at\r\n\r\nnight when thousands of people rush out of the stadium\r\n\r\nafter  a match and some have to cut across the grounds\r\n\r\nand open drains. And if accidents should occur at that\r\n\r\ntime,  there  is  the problem of getting  medical  aid\r\n\r\nimmediately  because of the heavy traffic leaving  the\r\n\r\nstadium.  Something must be done to cover up the  many\r\n\r\nopen drains which are around the stadium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that 30 squash courts, 70 tennis\r\n\r\ncourts but only three football pitches are provided in\r\n\r\nthe  master  plan. I wonder why there are  only  three\r\n\r\nfootball pitches. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsquash  and tennis courts will cater for the  affluent\r\n\r\nmembers  of  our  population.  Since  we  are  placing\r\n\r\nemphasis on mass participation, what we need  is  more\r\n\r\nfootball  pitches  because a football  pitch  if  used\r\n\r\nproperly will serve more people and it helps to  solve\r\n\r\npart  of our social problems particularly amongst  the\r\n\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Farrer Park football pitches are being well\r\n\r\nutilised  every  day so much so that  when  the  newly\r\n\r\nerected  lights  at  the  nearby  tennis  courts   are\r\n\r\nswitched  on some people take advantage of the  bright\r\n\r\nlights  to play football at night. Why should  we  not\r\n\r\nlight  up the football fields too? I am sure it  would\r\n\r\nbenefit  many office workers to play soccer at  night.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  we may succeed not only in letting our  young\r\n\r\ncitizens  spend their energy wisely but  also  produce\r\n\r\nfuture soccer stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, badminton seems to be dying a natural death.\r\n\r\nWhat  is really going on? Why is there such a lack  of\r\n\r\ninterest  in badminton? Our standard of badminton  was\r\n\r\nvery high at the time when it was a very popular game.\r\n\r\nmore  popular than soccer, but it has gone  down  very\r\n\r\nbadly,  particularly  after the  Thomas  Cup  went  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia. Something must be done to revive this  game\r\n\r\nand other games too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening of the Fitness Park is a good move. This\r\n\r\nMinistry could liaise with the Ministry of Culture  to\r\n\r\nintroduce a daily fitness programme over TV to serve a\r\n\r\ngreater  part  of  the  population  who,  for  various\r\n\r\nreasons, may not be able to go to the fitness park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister for Social Affairs is also\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  religious  matters,  I   take   this\r\n\r\nopportunity to ask him about the alternative  site  at\r\n\r\nToa Payoh for the building of a Hindu temple which  is\r\n\r\nat  present  sited in Somerset Road. This  alternative\r\n\r\nsite  about  5,000 sq. ft. seems to be too  small.  It\r\n\r\nseems that it can accommodate only a chicken coop, and\r\n\r\nmoreover  it  is  next  to a big  monsoon  drain.  The\r\n\r\nlocality  is very bad for a Hindu temple. As such  the\r\n\r\nsite  was  not  accepted and the matter  is  still  in\r\n\r\nabeyance for quite some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
