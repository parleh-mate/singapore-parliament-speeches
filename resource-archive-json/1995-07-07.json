Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether there are further plans to review the allocations of purchased Housing and Development Board flats for first time applicants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) (for the Minister for National Development): Mr Speaker, Sir, the allocation system was only recently reviewed in 1994. Arising from the review, HDB adopted a queue system in place of the balloting system in non-mature estates. One of the main objectives of the change was to improve the chances of first-timers as they are now allocated a fixed percentage of the flats: 60% of the flats are set aside for them. Furthermore, if they apply for flats in the North Zone where the waiting time is the shortest, they can expect to get a 4-room flat as quickly as within one year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiting time for those in the queue for 3-room buy-back flats is currently less than two years. And these applicants can take possession of their flats when their turn is due without having to wait out a long construction period. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has no plans to change the allocation system for the time being. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Sir, would the Senior Parliamentary Secretary clarify whether the prices of flats would remain affordable with the longer waiting time? Would there be a steeper price increase in the near future? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, would he also review the transitional rental housing scheme to provide, in the interim, a better opportunity for flats to be allocated to those who are on the waiting list? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, my Ministry will try to keep the flats affordable. No \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> doubt prices may increase following construction cost increases, but we will keep monitoring the situation and try to keep the prices as affordable as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On transitional rental housing, this is something we can review. I shall take this up with the Member further and find out what he has in mind. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo:</b> Sir, could the Senior Parliamentary Secretary provide advice, particularly to young first-timers applying for flats? Because there is a feeling that waiting time is longer than anticipated. What advice would he propose for those who are first-timers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, the flats in the North Zone have the shortest queue. For a 4-room flat, the waiting time is one year. These numbers are all made known to applicants. If everyone wants to go to the same zone, it is not possible for the HDB to build flats for them all at the same time. I would say that the applicants should keep themselves aware of the queuing times for various zones and try to make their plans according to their needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD SHOPS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Sale to sitting tenants)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for National Development what is the objective of the Government in selling Housing and Development Board shops to sitting tenants and whether the policy has achieved its desired results. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, the HDB launched the Sale Of Tenanted Shops Scheme in July 1992 as part of the overall retail sector plan to improve the efficiency and productivity of the retail industry. By allowing shopkeepers to own their shops, it would insulate them against future rental revisions. With less uncertainty over their operating costs, the shopkeepers will be able to further invest in and upgrade their shops to improve their operations, thereby increasing productivity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shopkeepers who own their shops now have a greater incentive to upgrade their shops, both internally and externally. So \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> far, as compared to rental shops, HDB has received about 50% more requests from owners of sold shops for upgrading of their premises in the form of additions and alteration works. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme has also encouraged shopkeepers to group themselves together to upgrade their commercial centres. The first two retail centres that have completed their upgrading programmes are in Yishun Neighbourhood 1 Centre and Yishun Neighbourhood 2 Centre. Shopkeepers of another seven retail centres have also approached the Retail Promotion Centre for assistance to upgrade their retail centres. A few of these centres, of which one of them is Bedok Town Centre, have commenced the upgrading of the mall. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sale of Tenanted Shops Scheme also provides an opportunity for shopkeepers who do not intend to continue their businesses to assign or sub-let their shops. In this way, more efficient retail operators can take over and thus contribute to the restructuring of the retail sector in HDB estates. Since the launch of the sale, there have been some 3,500 cases of assignment and sub-letting of shop tenancies. And of those already sold, only about 6% have been resold. Thus, the objective of the Sale of Tenanted Shops Scheme has been met. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, since the objective has been achieved, why has there been a slowing down of the sale of shops? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, in the past, the shops were valued according to the area and therefore a single valuation was applicable to many shops in the same area. This was found to be unsatisfactory by some of the tenants and they requested for HDB to make individual valuations. HDB has agreed to do so and therefore valuations of shops will be carried out individually.

For example, a vehicle registered on 31st July 1995 is deemed to have been registered on 1st July 1995. Its COE would lapse on 30th June 2005. The owner does not enjoy the full ten-year life-span of his COE. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give vehicle owners a fairer deal, with effect from 1st August 1995, all newly-registered vehicles will have their age computed from the day of registration. For illustration, the COE of a vehicle registered on 31st July 1995 will expire on its tenth anniversary date, ie, 30th July 2005, and not 30th June 2005 as at present. Vehicle buyers will not have to rush to register vehicles in the beginning of the month, which is the current practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registry of Vehicles will consequently adjust the legal life-span of existing vehicles according to their actual registration dates. As a result, COE and PARF expiry dates for many existing vehicles will be extended slightly. ROV will also pro-rate COE rebates for existing vehicles on a daily basis, and adjust the statutory life-span of all existing vehicles according to their actual dates of registration. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, due to the present method of calculating a vehicle's age, road taxes of all vehicles expire at the end of the month, either six or 12 months after the vehicles are registered. As owners tend to renew their road taxes just before they expire, the queues at ROV and its road tax collection centres are usually longer at the end of the month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st August 1995, the road tax expiry dates of newly-registered vehicles will expire exactly six or 12 months from the date of registration instead of at the end of the month. This will moderate the peak crowds and help to shorten queuing times for vehicle owners. However, existing vehicle owners will retain their current road tax expiry dates in order to avoid confusion,unless the status of their vehicles is changed, eg, they are converted from normal cars to Off-Peak Cars or vice versa. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROV will release details of the changes closer to the date of implementation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for his generosity.

These roads are our major commercial arteries. If they are choked, time will be wasted, costs will go up, and pollution will increase. As expressway pricing is a new concept to Singaporeans, we have started with the lowest possible fee we think is necessary to achieve our objective. We have also kept the operating hours short and started with only one expressway. My Ministry will monitor the scheme closely, and make adjustments if necessary. When the scheme has settled down and is clearly able to meet its objective, we can consider extending it to other expressways. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road usage charges such as Area Licensing and RPS fees reflect the costs which motorists impose on society as a whole - loss of productivity, time wasted, air and noise pollution. Therefore, it is only fair that the revenue collected go into public coffers to be used for the benefit of the whole society, including improving transport infrastructure such as roads, overhead bridges, walkways, bus interchanges, MRT systems and so on. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Imram bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Imram bin Mohamed (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, motorists are already quite heavily burdened with the purchase of a car and subsequent running costs, including one of the highest road taxes in the world. Is it fair to increase the burden further by charging the road users? After all, road pricing is a form of road tax. Should not revenues collected from road usage be passed back to motorists through perhaps a reduction in road tax? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, there are two issues that the Member has raised. First, is the question of fairness, whether motorists are being unfairly penalised because of this additional RPS fee. To that, Sir, I would say that it is a fairer system. Because in the case of the road pricing scheme, it is the user of that particular road at that particular time and the cost which that particular usage imposes on the rest of the motorists and on society as a whole, that is being charged for. If the motorist does not use that particular stretch of road, if he switches to public transport, if he uses another stretch of road or if he changes his time of travel, he does not need to pay. So the question of fairness actually does not come into the picture here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that the Member has raised, and which I have answered in my answer just now is, where does the money go to? In this case, as I have pointed out, the money goes to improving public transport infrastructure, building of MRT lines, construction of roads, highways, bridges, expansion of expressways, etc. I think the money is put to good use, provided we are able to justify it. At the same time, I must also add that it goes into public coffers so that that money is also used for other purposes for the public good. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether there has been any monitoring done so far on the success of this scheme. In particular, (1) by how much has the traffic along that particular route been reduced; (2) by how much has the traffic along the alternative routes been increased because of the RPS on the ECP; and (3) whether there has been any net change for the better if we combine the two? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the scheme was implemented on 1st June 1995. So it is roughly five weeks since we started. Under the circumstances, it is a little bit too early for us to answer the questions that the Member raised just now. At the same time, in the interim period, there have been some changes in the travelling pattern of motorists as a result of the reopening of schools. In any survey, we need to factor that in. But we are certainly monitoring the situation and as and when the situation stabilises, we will be able to form a clearer picture of what is the real impact of the various plans that we have made, and that is the appropriate time for us to come back to the Member and answer those questions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MANUAL FOREIGN WORKERS FROM NON-TRADITIONAL SOURCES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Employment)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. \n  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether his Ministry will introduce a policy to allow the entry of manual foreign workers from the non-traditional sources like Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, etc into our service-oriented and labour-intensive industries which are currently facing a decreasing supply of local manual workers and workers from Malaysia. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir, my Ministry is of the view that we should not open the manufacturing and service sectors to foreign workers from non-traditional sources (NTS). These sectors have been allowed to recruit foreign workers from Malaysia to supplement local workers. Experience shows that Malaysian workers, being from a traditional source, are less likely to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> create social problems as Malaysian employment practices and social norms are fairly similar to ours. While employers now have to put in greater effort to recruit Malaysian workers compared to a few years ago, because Malaysian wages have risen, the number of Malaysians coming to work in Singapore is still increasing. Compared to the construction and marine sectors, the manufacturing and service sectors have also less difficulty in attracting local and Malaysian workers as the working environment is much better. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allowing NTS workers into the manufacturing and service sectors can result in a big increase in the number of NTS workers in Singapore. This will aggravate the social problems caused by such workers and make it more difficult to manage the NTS worker population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of allowing NTS workers into the manufacturing and service sectors, we should examine whether we can make it easier for these sectors to attract more workers from our traditional source. My Ministry is presently reviewing the foreign worker policy to see how we can do so. For a start, last year, we raised the dependency ceiling for the manufacturing sector from 45% to 50% and for the service sector from 20% to 25%. I am aware that higher wages and ample employment opportunities in Malaysia have made it less attractive for Malaysian workers to work in Singapore, and that Malaysian wages are closer to Singapore wages compared to wages in the home countries of NTS workers. We will take this into consideration in our review. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he would therefore look into the reduction of the foreign workers' levy from the traditional sources as part of his review \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, we are reviewing the foreign worker policy.

Hence, in order to provide a mechanism for management and workers of larger factories to deal with safety and health issues, the Factories Act requires factories in which 50 or more persons are employed, to form safety committees for the purpose of promoting the safety and health of the workers employed in such factories. Such committees must meet at least once a month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law also requires that such a committee comprises a chairman, a secretary and representatives of both employees and the management. The chairman and the secretary are appointed from the management representatives. To enable the committee to function effectively, the law stipulates that the number of representatives in the committee (including the chairman and secretary) is not less than six, three from the employees and three from the management. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in factories which employ less than 50 workers, there should be more opportunities for direct interaction between management and workers. Such factories can adequately ensure the safety and health of their workers through their managers and supervisors interacting directly with the workers without having to go through a safety committee. Furthermore, some factories may be so small as to have practical difficulty to form meaningful safety committees. My Ministry has no intention to require factories with less than 50 employees to form safety committees. Nevertheless, my Ministry continues to monitor closely \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1321</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> industrial safety and health in such factories and should the need arise, we will review the law.

The Select Committee Report on the constitutional amendment Bill recommended that the new provisions should not be entrenched for two years, in order to give the Government a free hand to fine-tune the provisions during a running-in period. The Prime Minister, in his Third Reading speech to Parliament, endorsed the need for a running-in period but favoured more time, at least four years, to make the necessary modifications and refinements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 1994, Parliament passed a set of amendments to the Elected President provisions in the Constitution. In my speech moving the Second Reading of that amendment, I stated: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is impossible, with a complex and novel piece of legislation like this, to foresee all consequences and implications of the provisions upfront. The three years we have operated the new provisions has enabled us to understand better how the mechanism operates, where the loopholes and ambiguities are, what is practicable and what needs to be modified in the light of experience. We have discovered that the Elected President mechanism is even more complex than we originally anticipated. It is extremely difficult to balance the Government's need for operational flexibility with the President's duty to exercise effective oversight. As we operate the mechanism day to day, we are still discovering implications of the provisions which we had not realised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will therefore not be the final set of amendments before we can safely entrench the Elected President provisions.

The relatively large appreciation against the US$ partly reflects the weakness of the US$ in international markets. On a trade-weighted basis, the appreciation of the Singapore dollar is much less. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned in this House in May, MTI and its statutory boards are helping the Monetary Authority of Singapore to conduct an in-depth study into the impact of the appreciation of the Singapore dollar on different industries. This study is still on-going and will be completed in several months' time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, MTI's feedback from the manufacturing companies about the effects of the Singapore dollar is mixed. They depend on the specific circumstances of the companies. Companies whose export earnings are mainly denominated in US$ and whose inputs are mainly in Yen or Deutschemark are adversely affected. Conversely, companies whose export revenues are in Yen or Deutschemark benefit. For the manufacturing sector as a whole, as the US is a bigger export market than Germany or Japan, there has been pressure on profit margins. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tourism sector, the impact of the strong Singapore dollar is one of the many factors affecting tourism. Other important factors include the state of the economy in the tourist-generating countries, the development of excellent and competitively priced shopping facilities in the ASEAN countries which comprise the bulk of our tourist arrivals, and the competition from many new tourist destinations in the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> When the Government does the study, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> does the Government intend to include in this study some policy recommendations to help the private sector adjust not only to the magnitude of the appreciation of the S$ but, I believe, the pace of appreciation of the S$, vis-a-vis these other currencies? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, as the Finance Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister previously explained, the value of the Singapore dollar is determined by the international foreign exchange market and it will be impossible for the Singapore Government to artificially set the value of the Singapore dollar.

In fact, we are now in the midst of reviewing the role of the NPB and other agencies in the productivity improvement programme to see how we can make better use of the capabilities that we have and to review how we can reach out more effectively to the private sector to help them upgrade and improve their productivity. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, I am glad that the Minister has said that the Government would try somehow to moderate the pace of appreciation of the S$ relative to these other currencies.

The aim was to discourage the offer of rewards to entice card holders to spend excessively and beyond their means in order to qualify for the incentives. Furthermore, stiff competition in the credit card business had led to concerns amongst some card issuers that the use of increasingly costly incentive schemes will ultimately have to be passed on to cardholders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government supports the healthy growth of the credit and charge card business as it contributes towards the creation of a cashless society.

Throughout history, trading communities like the Jews, Venetians, Parsees and Chinese \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1329</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> overseas have reconciled the two needs by preserving strong family values and cultural traditions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internationalisation of the Singapore economy is thus not only an economic challenge for us but also a cultural challenge as well. We have to facilitate the use of information technology and make cable TV and other multi-media services available. But we also have to strengthen our cultural underpinnings as well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Censorship can no longer be 100% effective but even if it is only 20% effective, we should still not stop censoring. The act of censorship itself affirms to young and old of our society's determination to keep to certain values. We cannot screen every bit of information that comes down the information highway, but we can make it illegal and costly for mass distributors of objectionable material to operate in Singapore. We are not the only country concerned with the increasing difficulty of censorship. The US Senate, for example, has recently voted to make any obscene communication in any form on the Internet punishable by fine and imprisonment. However, this is likely to be challenged in the US Supreme Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Censorship will never be enough. What is more important is our society's ability to preserve and transmit the right values. The family is key. So too our schools, our religious institutions and our civic organisations. There must be, at all levels, moral leadership. At the end of the day, it is values, culture and tradition which will hold us together. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we can only internationalise successfully if we retain this strong sense of self and of our distinctiveness as Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, does the Ministry tend to have any sort of censorship regarding material which is critical of the Government? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, it depends on what the Nominated Member refers to as \"critical of the Government\", and presumably which is politically so. Over the years, we have developed a political culture which accepts certain \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> norms, which also proscribes discussion which may be incendiary and can cause racial, religious or other kinds of hatreds. These norms will continue to apply. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important when we are talking about cyberspace is to make a distinction between discussion which is in the nature of narrow-casting as opposed to discussion which is in the area of broadcasting. Broadcasting is always more sensitive because large numbers of people are reached simultaneously. But in the case of Internet, it is such a jungle there and you can have all kinds of discussion going on at odd corners and no one, except for the most determined, would take notice. So for those, what I would call \"niche discussions\", we can take a more relaxed approach. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Does the Government mean that where Internet is concerned, anything goes regarding these articles, apart from pornography? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very difficult to generalise because Internet is going through a revolution and we are not quite sure how it will shape out and what new rules, new patterns, will emerge. I expect in the years to come that there will be parts of Internet which are like public spaces where communications are in the nature of broadcasting. For those public spaces, we will continue to regulate and police strictly. But where they are discussions taking place in dark alleys - and indeed community action all over the world will force certain kinds of discussion to go under deep cover - I think we can afford to be less stringent. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FERRY SERVICE ALONG EAST COAST</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Chiam See Tong - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. To ask the Minister for Communications whether he will consider the running of a ferry service along the east coast, now that there will be sufficient passenger load, considering the congestion of traffic along the East Coast Parkway, and the necessity to impose a road pricing scheme there. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Question No. 13, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a ferry service between Clifford Pier and the east coast is conceptually possible. The question is: is there a sufficient demand and is the service financially viable? Currently, there are no landing points available along the east coast for passengers to board and alight domestic ferries. However, if private operators are keen to provide such a service, and there is sustainable demand for a viable service, the Port of Singapore Authority will consider providing a landing point for the ferry service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not confuse the Road Pricing Scheme (RPS) on the ECP with the viability of a ferry service along the east coast. As I had explained to the House earlier, we implemented the Road Pricing Scheme on the ECP for two reasons. First, RPS is a new road pricing concept and we need to give motorists time to familiarise themselves with it. That is why we implemented RPS on only one congested expressway, and we kept the licence fee low and the operation hours short. Second, we chose the ECP because there are many alternatives available to motorists using the ECP. If they choose to continue to drive, they can use other routes, or they can change their time of travel. Better still, they may wish to switch to a wide range of good public transport services in this area. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ROAD TAX</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Reduction)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Imram bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. \n  <b>Mr Imram bin Mohamed</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether road tax will be reduced with the introduction of the electronic road pricing system. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system will allow the Government greater flexibility to deal with congestion at different times and different places, and to price road usage more equitably to maintain acceptable traffic conditions.

The vehicle tax structure will be rationalised to strike a judicious balance among the various costs, including one-time ownership costs like COE and ARF, annual operating costs like road tax, and usage costs like ERP charges. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MORTGAGE INTEREST RATE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Impact of increases on households)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether his Ministry has assessed the impact of the current increases in mortgage interest rate on households, especially those who have taken 25 years' loan and who still have substantial loan repayable to the Housing and Development Board; and (b) what is the maximum additional amount mortgagors will have to pay each month, based on the new basis of instalment computation after the interest rate increases. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB finances its mortgage loans with funds from the Government, part of which comes from the Central Provident Fund. HDB's mortgage loan interest rate is thus pegged at 0.1 percentage point above the CPF interest rate. Therefore, when the CPF Board raised its interest rate to 3.82% per annum, the HDB mortgage loan rate was also raised accordingly from 3.2% to 3.92% from 1st July 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If HDB purchasers want fixed interest rates, then all CPF accounts will have to be paid fixed interest rates. This will not be fair or welcomed by CPF depositors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fluctuations in HDB mortgage loan interest rate is no different from the fluctuating interest rates charged by the commercial banks. Notwithstanding the latest increase, the HDB mortgage loan interest rate is still well below the market interest rate charged by the commercial banks, which averages above 6%. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantum of increase in the instalment payments will vary depending on the outstanding loan balance and the balance of the repayment period. For example, a mortgagor with a housing loan of $100,000 repayable over 25 years will pay an additional monthly instalment of $40. About 75% of those who have taken a mortgage loan with 25-year repayment period will pay an increase of between $1 and $40 per month more; while not more than 10% will have to pay more than $60 extra. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mortgagors who are in genuine financial hardship, HDB will consider each case on its own merits and adopt measures to assist them if they are in genuine hardship. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, are there mortgagors who have to pay more than $100 per month with this new increase? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, I do not know that.

The loan terms are very generous. Repayment terms are also very \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> generous. They will still remain affordable. In fact, today's interest rates are lower than the rates of a few years ago. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his second question regarding the basis of computation, it is calculated this way. The Government borrows money from CPF account holders at a certain percentage rate and this rate is the one on which HDB loans are calculated. When the CPF account holders are paid X%, then this money is borrowed by the Government and lent to HDB flat buyers and the HDB flat buyers are charged X.1%. This is the basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am asking about the new basis of instalment computation, which is based on the balance of the mortgage loan or the balance of repayment years.

But they did not and could not enjoy the fruits of their labour because they retired early, and before Singapore was as developed as today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To re-cap, the three groups of older Singaporeans I have said that I would like to recognise in tangible ways are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the special group of MPs and Ministers \"whose stout-heartedness and great personal sacrifice made a difference to Singapore's history. They stood for elections between 1959 and before 1968, and retired by 1984 ... They fought the communists and the communalists, stayed the course despite personal risks to their lives and limbs .... Their salaries were deliberately held down because those were difficult times.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the public sector pensioners who retired before March 1972 when salaries were revised and pensionable public officers brought under the CPF Act. They worked with the Government of those turbulent times to tackle difficult problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the group of older Singaporeans who have mostly retired before Medisave was introduced in 1984. They too, as ordinary Singaporeans, have worked hard, supported the Government but have little or no Medisave today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The studies on how to provide for fair and meaningful recognition have been completed. I shall now give the details. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Older MPs and Ministers</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older pioneering MPs and Ministers are our very own \"Long Marchers\". Singapore owes a debt to these robust few. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, as Prime Minister, provided the inspirational leadership and vision. Dedicated MPs and Ministers worked the ground, rallied the people, vanquished threats and overcame challenges. Singapore's successful transformation to a stable, peaceful, secure and affluent country would not have been possible without their courage, commitment and sacrifice during those critical periods, especially the crisis periods of 1961-1963 and 1963-1965 against Communist and communalist attacks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have initially indicated that we would consider only those MPs on pension who stood for elections between 1959 and before 1968 and retired by 1984. However, the period from 1968 to the early 1970s were also difficult years. Singapore then had to overcome the consequences of the British Forces' withdrawal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided that a one-off ex-gratia payment will be paid to all retired MPs and Office Holders who are in receipt of a pension now, and who were elected between 1959 and 1980 and retired before 31st December 1992. Note that not all former MPs will receive this ex-gratia payment. Only those who had qualified for pension and had contributed to Singapore's stability and growth through their support of Government policies will be given this ex-gratia payment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, MPs and office-holders who were elected before 1980 but are still serving would not receive this ex-gratia payment because they have enjoyed regular revisions to their allowances and salaries to date. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ex-gratia payment will be based on the number of months of service put in by the eligible MPs and Office-Holders. It will favour those who were elected in the earlier years because they played a more critical role in ensuring the survival of the Government and Singapore. The MP allowances and Office-Holder salaries were also much smaller then. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula for the ex-gratia payment for former MPs will be as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$300 per month for each month of service for those elected on 30th May 1959. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$200 for each month of service for those elected on 21st September 1963. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$150 for each month of service for those elected between 1st March 1966 to 13th April 1968. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$100 for each month of service for those elected between 18th April 1970 to 23rd December 1980. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this ex-gratia payment for MP service, MPs who are also pensioned office-holders will be paid an ex-gratia based on the actual number of months of office-holding service as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those appointed in 1959, the amount paid will be $200 for each month of office-holder service for Minister, Senior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister; $150 for each month of service for Minister of State and Senior Minister of State; and $100 for each month of service for Political Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary and Senior Parliamentary Secretary. For those appointed in 1963, the figures for the three groups would be $150, $100 and $75. For those appointed in 1968 and after, the respective figures would be $100 for Minister, Senior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister; $50 for Minister of State and Senior Minister of State; and $50 for Political Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary and Senior Parliamentary Secretary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost to the Government will be about $2.6 million, comprising $1.99 million for MP ex-gratia payments and $620,000 for office-holder ex-gratia payments. I would like to stress that this is merely a token recognition for the sterling and selfless service of these pioneering leaders. It is not meant to and cannot fully reflect their significant contribution to the nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Older Public Sector Pensioners</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early Members of Parliament and Ministers were ably supported by honest, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> efficient and dedicated public servants who worked tirelessly in the background and effectively carried out Government policies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had earlier indicated that we reward only those public servants who retired before March 1972. This was a date when all pensionable public officers were brought under the CPF Act. Before that, they did not enjoy the benefits of the employers' contributions to their CPF. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another factor which needs to be taken into account. The National Wages Council (NWC), also established in 1972, institutionalised the concept of linking wage increases to economic growth. Prior to this, wage adjustments took into account cost of living but were not linked to economic growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the NWC resulted in a series of annual wage increases (over and above normal salary increments) for public sector officers. For instance, the NWC wage increases up to 1st November 1977 amounted to 30-40% of basic salary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NWC wage increases were non-pensionable. Thus, while they benefitted the officers in service, they had no impact on the officers' pensions. However, on 1st November 1977, the NWC wage increases were consolidated into basic salary. This resulted in a corresponding increase in subsequent pensions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1st November 1977 and 1st January 1982, NWC wage increases amounting to 33-44% of basic salary were paid. These wage increases remained non-pensionable until 1st January 1982 when there was a second consolidation of NWC wage increases into basic salary. This benefitted officers who retired after that date, but not those before it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, until the introduction of the flexi-wage system, NWC wage increases were automatically made pensionable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it is only fair for the Government to recognise not only pensionable public officers who retired before April 1972 and did not enjoy the CPF benefits, but also those who retired during the 1972-1981 period of rapid NWC but non-pensionable wage adjustments. The Government has \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> therefore decided to give all public sector pensioners who retired before 1st January 1982 a one-off ex-gratia payment, instead of confining it only to those who retired before March 1972. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ex-gratia payment will be given to deserving Singaporean public sector officers only. Those who were retired in the public interest on disciplinary grounds under the PSC Disciplinary Proceedings Regulations will not receive the ex-gratia payment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly 5,000 public sector pensioners will benefit from this scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ex-gratia payment will be based on an officer's pension as this reflects his divisional status and years of service. The rate will be as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement date before 1st April 1972, the ex-gratia payment will be 13.5 months of pension, subject to a maximum of $13,500. Retirement date between 1st April 1972 and 31st October 1977, the ex-gratia payment will be 10.5 months of pension, subject to a maximum of $10,500. Retirement date between 1st November 1977 and 31st December 1981, six months of pension, subject to a maximum of $6,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ex-gratia payment for the eligible public sector pensioners will amount to $15 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Older Singaporeans Who Retired Before Medisave Was Introduced</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to the third group, ie, those older Singaporeans who retired before Medisave was introduced on 1st April 1984. The Medisave scheme requires all working Singaporeans to save in their Medisave Accounts an amount equivalent to 6% of their wages. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medisave has now become an essential component of our health care system. In 1994, 89% of hospital admissions used Medisave to pay their hospital bills. Total Medisave withdrawals of $291 million paid for 60% of hospital billing in that year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans who retired before April 1984, however, have no Medisave Accounts. Also, those who retired soon after 1984 have little time to build up their Medisave balances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the strong performance of the economy and the healthy budget surpluses in recent years, a Pre-Medisave Top-up Grant will be given to these Singaporeans. This will be a one-off exercise to recognise their valuable contributions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Pre-Medisave Top-up Grant, the Government will help the older Singaporeans to build up their own Medisave Accounts. The primary target of the Pre-Medisave Top-up Grant are those who were 55 and above before April 1984. They would generally have retired by then and hence would have no Medisave Accounts. However, as those who retired soon after April 1984 would not have sufficient time to build up their Medisave balances, the Pre-Medisave Top-up Grant is extended to those who were between 50 and 55 years of age on 1st April 1984. But they will receive smaller top-ups. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will pay $1,050 into each Medisave Account of all Singaporeans who were 55 years or above on 1st April 1984. For those who were between 50 and 55 years on 1st April 1984, their top-ups will follow a sliding scale: \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n     Age Group            Quantum of\r\n\r\n(on 1st April 1984)      Pre-Medisave\r\n\r\n                            Top-up\r\n\r\n                            Total\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     55 &amp; above             $1,050\r\n\r\n     54 - &lt;55               $  900\r\n\r\n     53 - &lt;54               $  750\r\n\r\n     52 - &lt;53               $  600\r\n\r\n     51 - &lt;52               $  450\r\n\r\n     50 - &lt;51               $  300\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pre-Medisave Top-up Grant will amount to about $250 million, benefitting nearly 300,000 older Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Timing of Payments</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ex-gratia payment for the former MPs and Ministers, and public servant pensioners will be paid out in January 1996 into their CPF Ordinary Accounts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-off Pre-Medisave Top-up Grant by the Government will be made in three equal yearly instalments, on 1st January 1996, 1st January 1997 and 1st January 1998. However, the second and third payments are subject to continuing strong economic growth and healthy budget surplus, as the Government cannot use past reserves for this top-up grant. While the January 1996 payment, which amounts to $85 million, will proceed, the Government would review its ability to make the January 1997 and January 1998 payments in 1996 and 1997 respectively. The decision will be made each year, after the Budget but before 1st July. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for each yearly Pre-Medisave Top-up, a small co-payment into the Medisave Account of $50 is required. Family members are expected to contribute this token sum on behalf of their elders. This co-payment aspect of the Pre-Medisave Top-up Grant underlines our approach of joint responsibility towards health care financing. It is also in line with our traditional family values. The eligible Singaporeans will be given six months, from 1st July to 31st December, to make the co-payment to qualify for the Pre-Medisave Top-up on 1st January of the following year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Conclusion</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has done well because a generation of retired MPs,Ministers, public servants and Singaporeans had sacrificed and worked hard in order that future generations may enjoy. We should, as the Chinese saying goes, \"Remember the source when drinking water\". It is only right that Parliament recognises the contributions of those older Singaporeans who have laid the foundation stone for today's high standard of living. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Singapore goes from here will depend on today's generation of MPs and Ministers, public servants and Singaporeans. What are the implications of being classified as a developed economy? What will be the challenges ahead? How do we prepare for the future? These are issues my colleagues and I are grappling with. But one thing is sure, we must not let the older generations down. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> We must all carry on their good work and give the generations of Singaporeans after us a better future. [Applause]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, may I seek two clarifications from the Prime Minister? One, would the Prime Minister tell this House the number of ex-Ministers, Senior Ministers of State, Ministers of State, Senior Parliamentary Secretaries, Parliamentary Secretaries and MPs who will be benefitting from this ex-gratia payment? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, would the Prime Minister give this House a breakdown of the pension currently drawn by ex-political office-holders who have retired? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Eunos GRC):</b> By way of clarification,Sir. Some MPs and civil servants have died. But if they are living, they would enjoy these benefits. Would their surviving spouses enjoy the benefits? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of MPs,Ministers and other office-holders who would benefit from the ex-gratia payment is 47. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Total? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> That is the total number. I do not have the amount of pension each one of them is receiving. The figures can be easily available if he submits a Question. Parliament can prepare the pension figures these office-holders are getting now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chew's question, we give ex-gratia payment to only living pensioners. We just cannot go back in time. If a former MP has passed away, I would just say, \"We are sorry.\" But we just cannot go back in time all the way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask the Prime Minister why ex-MPs who served less than two terms or did not qualify for pension are left out? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> There must be a certain minimum period of service. For those MPs who did not qualify for a pension because they served less than the reckonable period, then they would not be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> recognised for this purpose. Because you recognise only those who have served a minimum period, and that minimum period will be the qualifying period for getting a pension, which is a minimum of nine years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Does the Prime Minister agree that even if an MP served less than, say, nine or 10 years, he might have contributed significantly to his constituency and also to the country? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> He might have contributed. But, again, it must be significant contribution. And the significant contribution would also be measured by the period. They must have served a certain number of years. If his argument is right, then Parliament should have passed a law to give pension to all MPs who have served, regardless of the minimum period. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>1.50 pm \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Central Provident Fund Act (Chapter 36 of the 1994 Revised Edition)\", \n  <br>\n  <br>presented by the Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LAND TRANSPORT AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to establish and incorporate the Land Transport Authority of Singapore, to provide for its functions and powers, and for matters connected therewith; and to make consequential amendments to certain other Acts\", \n  <br>\n  <br>presented by the Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEMS BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to provide for the planning, construction, operation and maintenance of rapid transit systems, to transfer the functions, assets and liabilities of the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation to the Land Transport Authority of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singapore, to repeal the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation Act (Chapter 172 of the 1988 Revised Edition) and to make consequential amendments to certain other Acts\", \n  <br>\n  <br>presented by Mr Mah Bow Tan; read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>STREET WORKS BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"relating to street works and matters connected therewith and to repeal the Local Government Integration Act (Chapter 166 of the 1985 Revised Edition)\", \n  <br>\n  <br>presented by Mr Mah Bow Tan; read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LEGAL AID AND ADVICE BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact the provisions of the Legal Aid and Advice Act (Chapter 160 of the 1985 Revised Edition). The main objective of the Bill is to update the means test for eligibility for legal aid without increasing the manpower resources available in the Legal Aid Bureau. The Bill also deletes Part II of the Act on legal aid in criminal cases which has never been brought into operation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the main changes to the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Bill revises the existing requirements as to the means of an applicant for legal aid to bring it more in tune with present day monetary values. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill empowers the Minister to authorise the Director of Legal Aid to grant legal aid to any applicant who does not qualify for legal aid if it is in the public interest that legal aid be granted to the applicant. The reason for this provision is to provide for exceptional cases where in the public interest, it may be necessary for the Minister to authorise the Director to give legal aid to a group of persons, some of whom may not qualify within the strict provisions of the Act such as, for example, the victims of the Spyros disaster. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill clarifies that legal aid is available only to citizens and permanent residents. Currently, the Act does not state the category of persons eligible for legal aid. The administrative practice has been to give legal aid to citizens and permanent residents which is right, as legal aid involves the allocation of public monies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Bill increases the fine for the offence of giving a false statement in connection with an application for legal aid. This is because we should take a serious view of those who abuse or misuse legal aid facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, Part II of the existing Act which has never been brought into operation will be deleted. This is because the policy of the Government is not to grant legal aid in criminal cases except for cases involving capital punishment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, the Bill empowers the Minister to amend the Second Schedule which sets out the means test by way of Regulations through notification in the Gazette. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the updating of the means test in this amending legislation will be welcomed by Members of this House, because several Members, I recall, like Dr Ho Tat Kin, Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Mr Eugene Yap and Dr Arthur Beng, to name a few, have in recent years urged me to review the means test which has not been changed for a long time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present definitions of \"disposable capital\" and \"disposable income\" have also been fine-tuned to take into account present day realities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me highlight the main changes to the means test. Firstly, the disposable capital and income limits for eligibility for legal aid which are presently $3,500 and $3,000 per annum respectively have been increased to $7,000 in each case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the disposable capital and disposable income limits of persons who do not have to make any contribution which are now $500 and $1,000 per annum respectively have been changed to $2,000 in each case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill changes the definitions of \"disposable capital\" and \"disposable \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> income\" so as to allow more deductions. For example, in calculating disposable capital, we will exclude an HDB flat owned by the applicant or any other dwelling house with an annual value of not more than $7,710. We also exclude savings of up to $30,000 if he is aged 60 and above and we also exclude the applicant's CPF monies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the last six years from 1989 to 1994, the number of cases registered with the Legal Aid Bureau has stabilised at between 6,000 and 7,000 cases per year. In contrast, during the early 80s, the number of cases ranged from 8,000 to 10,000 cases. More than half of the cases concern matrimonial matters. Other types of cases include claims in contract and tort, matters relating to tenancy, probate, deed poll, adoption, statutory declarations, testamentary dispositions and powers of attorney. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a projection has been made of the implications on the workload of the Bureau as a result of the proposed revised means test. In revising the disposable income criteria to the new limits, the Bureau anticipates an increase of about 1,200 legal aid cases a year, or a 30% increase. We believe that these additional cases can be managed by the Bureau with its existing complement of staff and resources. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Sir, I support this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to make a brief comment on the question of criminal legal aid. In the old Legal Aid and Advice Act, Part II, as the Minister has said, was never brought into force. It is well and good to give legal aid to civil litigants. The danger, of course, of giving legal aid in civil litigation type situations is that sometimes one encourages frivolous litigation. And when we are talking about civil litigation, it is a question of money. But in the case of criminal prosecutions, very often, a poor person cannot afford a lawyer. Here, it is not just money at stake. The person could go to jail. In capital cases, we have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> assigned counsel. But in all other cases, the only legal aid that poor people can get for criminal cases is the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme run by the Law Society of Singapore. This is financed entirely, I think, out of the generosity of members of the legal profession. It seems paradoxical that in something like civil legal aid, the Government should provide funds. But in matters where a person could actually lose his livelihood, lose his freedom, there is no such provision of funds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister, who said that it is not the Government's policy to provide criminal legal aid, to reconsider this, to at least look into the possibility of some sort of criminal legal aid for poor people. These are the people who need it most. Millionaires can buy legal advice by the ton, gold-plated. They can have a media circus, as we have seen in other countries. It is the poor who need criminal legal aid most of all. And I do not think in this kind of situation that leaving it to private enterprise is an entirely satisfactory matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those comments, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is long awaited and timely. The current means test is unrealistic in today's context. The upward revision is therefore welcomed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, legal costs have risen. I see this Bill as another step taken by the Government to complement the measures taken by the Judiciary to make justice more affordable and available to Singaporeans. Other innovations include enhancing the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal, encouraging Alternative Dispute Resolution processes, setting up the Family Court and instituting mediation processes in our court system. The Law Society of Singapore, as already mentioned by Assoc. Prof. Woon, has also done its part by giving pro bono criminal legal aid and by holding talks and exhibitions on the law. These measures on the part of Government, Judiciary and the Law Society are laudable. I am sure Singaporeans are appreciative of this trend. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will be a great boon to Singaporeans who may require the assistance of a lawyer, particularly in non-commercial matters such as divorce and probate. Over the years, the Legal Aid Bureau has performed good service to help lower income Singaporeans tide over difficult times. Raising the means test will enable the Bureau to benefit more Singaporeans in distress. And I am glad to note that the Bureau will be able to cope with the increased workload. I hope that the Government will continue to track the cost of living in Singapore, particularly in regard to legal fees, and revise the means test accordingly should the need arise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the move to delete the part of the Act on provision by Government of criminal legal aid. It is inconsistent, in principle, for the Government to both prosecute and defend the same accused person. I see this as paradoxical. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Law Society of Singapore runs a well-regarded and successful Criminal Legal Aid Scheme to provide criminal legal aid to accused persons in non-capital cases. What are the types of cases in which they assist? It ranges from the Arms and Explosives Act, the Enlistment Act, Public Nuisance Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act. It covers a wide range and I think that the people who cannot afford will benefit from this Criminal Legal Aid Scheme run by the Law Society. And I am sure that they are assured that they will get good legal counsel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this is the way to go - an effective partnership where Government provides defence counsel in capital cases and the legal community volunteers its services in non-capital cases, which is to be applauded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in closing, may I say that our belief in the legal-criminal-justice system must remain unshakable. Indeed, it was only in the last sitting of this House that we reaffirmed this. This means that we believe that the Police will investigate thoroughly, without fear or favour, before a recommendation is made to proceed; that the Attorney-General's Chambers must be convinced that there is a case \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> before a person is brought to court. The issue of legal aid for criminal cases must be seen in this setting and not in isolation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to differ from Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon's position with regard to the provision of legal aid for criminal cases. It is not wise for the Government to provide legal assistance for criminal cases. I support the position of Dr Arthur Beng. I think our resources are very limited. We should give all the resources available to the civil legal aid cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank the Members who have spoken in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon's point can be argued with some persuasion. But as I said, the Government's policy is to provide legal aid to criminal cases only in capital offences. The reasoning for this policy is that it is very similar to the points mentioned by Dr Arthur Beng. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To elaborate, the State spends a lot of resources in maintaining as best as possible a first-class, top-rate law enforcement machinery - the Police, the Central Narcotics Bureau, the Commercial Affairs Department and so on. It also invests heavily in an excellent legal service with very good legal officers handling prosecutions, who sieve and vet all the police investigation papers. Their job is to investigate offences when there is evidence to prosecute, when accused persons are brought to book, only after thorough and careful process. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are they prosecuted? They are prosecuted in the public interest and the State expends these monies in the public interest and in order to protect the law abiding majority. Therefore, I agree with Dr Arthur Beng that it is paradoxical. It is incongruous and inconsistent that public funds should be used to defend an accused person which the State has decided ought to be charged in court and use public funds at the same time to get him off. The exception is where life is involved and for capital cases, counsel is assigned. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree that the legal profession itself has a role to play here. The legal profession has grown since the days the Legal Aid Act was enacted in the 1950s. It is larger today than what it was in the 1950s. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legal Profession Act states that one of the purposes of the Law Society is: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to make provision for or assist in the promotion of a scheme whereby impecunious persons on non-capital charges are represented by advocates.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Parliament's intent is, to some extent, very clear that the legal profession must fulfil this social and public role through the Law Society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity really to commend the Law Society for running a very well established criminal legal aid system since 1985. I know many lawyers who give of their time voluntarily and I want to congratulate the Law Society on its programme which is in the right direction. I have told the President of the Law Society that I will do my best to give support to him and his council in their commendable efforts on the Criminal Legal Aid System, provided it does not involve State funds. I will discuss with the Attorney-General how best we can give such support. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 5 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, line 1, to leave out \"section 8(2)(b)\" and insert \"sections 8(2)(b) and 9(1)\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment that I have proposed is a technical amendment. If Members would look at clause 8(2)(b), in order for a person to qualify for legal aid, the Director of Legal Aid must be satisfied that the applicant does not possess more than the disposable capital or the disposable income stated in the Second Schedule; basically, $7,000 per annum disposable income and $7,000 disposable capital. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6(3)(b) says that when you look at clause 8(2)(b) and the applicant is an unmarried infant and the guardian is a relative, you combine the two. That presumably is to cover the situation where you have an infant (which, I presume, means a person under the age of 21) whose parents may be rich, but who himself has no income and no disposable capital. That is to plug the obvious loophole where a person goes for legal aid using his child, who may have been injured in some way, refuses to pay because if we did not have that, his income would not be aggregated with the child's. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we look at clause 9. In clause 9, if the applicant's disposable income or disposable capital exceeds a certain amount, a contribution can be levied. Here is where the contradiction arises. When we look at the application, we aggregate the guardian's income and capital with the infant's. But when we look at the contribution, we do not. So we might get a situation where legal aid is granted to someone under clause 8(b) but no contribution can be levied, because the infant himself has no income. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Jayakumar has referred to the new provision in clause 8(4) where the Minister can approve legal aid to a person who falls outside the strict criteria. So we may get a situation where legal aid has been approved under clause 8(4), but because of the way clause 9 is phrased, no contribution is payable either. It is for this reason that I have suggested the amendment that stands in my name to include a reference to clause 9(1) in clause 3(b), so that when it comes to assessment of contribution, it is possible to levy a contribution in the case of a guardian or in the case where we have a clause 8(4) authorization by the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, on Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon's first amendment, I think he has a point. I believe his amendment would be an improvement to the Bill and I have no difficulty in accepting it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, line 8, to leave out from \"relative\" to the end of line 13 and insert \"includes in the case of an adopted child his adoptive parents.\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment to clause 8 is again a technical one. The question is: what is the definition of \"relative\"? In clause 6(3)(b), one aggregates the income of the relative together with that of the infant. \"Relative\" is defined restrictively in clause 6(4) to mean, in the case of a legitimate child, his parents; in the case of an adopted child, an adopting parent; and in the case of an illegitimate child, the mother. The way that it has been phrased, \"relative\" excludes all other relatives. So we might get a situation where the child is being looked after by an uncle or a grandparent or an aunt or some other more distant relatives, not necessarily the mother. We might get the situation where the illegitimate child is being looked after by the father. In those situations, we might find that the relative actually does have the means, but his income and disposable capital are not aggregated because of the restrictive definition of \"relative\". So taken to an extreme, we have a child who is being cared for by a rich millionaire grandparent. But because grandparent is not a relative, the grandparent's income and disposable capital are not considered either on the application for legal aid or on the assessment of contribution. The Legal Aid Bureau could grant legal aid in a situation like that, notwithstanding that the grandparent can well afford to pay for the services of the Legal Aid Bureau or of a private lawyer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to cover this kind of situation that I have suggested the amendment. In other words, instead of making it a restrictive definition by saying \"relative means\", I have suggested that the clause be changed to say \"relative includes\". The word \"includes\" implies one uses the normal dictionary understanding of \"relative\". The only thing that needs to be defined clearly is who is a \"relative\" when we are talking about adopted children. Because there could be an argument about whether or not the adoptive parents are deemed to be relatives since they are not relatives by blood and would not be relatives in the normal sense in an adoption case. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of my amendment is that we take out the restrictive definition. We say \"relative\" includes in the case of an adopted child his adoptive parents, to make it clear that his adoptive parents are relatives, but leave the term \"relative\" to its normal dictionary meaning. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon's amendment is well-intentioned, but I would like to explain why I will not be able to accept it. He proposes to delete the existing definition of relative, which specifies what the term means in respect of illegitimate, legitimate and adopted children. His proposal is to have an inclusive provision defining the term only for the case of an adopted child. He argues that the present definition is too restrictive. I am unable to accept his amendment because it would leave the term \"relative\" undefined. Such an approach would be too wide and would create uncertainties. The Legal Aid Bureau would, in fact, encounter considerable practical difficulties in administering the means test in the absence of any clear criterion as to who qualifies as a relative. Therefore, in the interest of both certainty and parity, the existing definition, in my view, should be retained. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, we have had this definition for a long time in the statutes. I have discussed this with the Director of Legal Aid who has informed me that the Bureau has had no problems in applying this definition in practice. Of course, I recognise that there can be isolated instances, like the hypothetical cases mentioned by Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon where an infant stays with a rich or multi-millionaire grandparent or rich uncle. But in reality and in practice, such cases do not come to the Legal Aid Bureau. If they do, and if the Legal Aid Bureau is satisfied that it would be an abuse of the process, then I would like to assure Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon that the scheme of the Act is that people are eligible for legal aid. There is no entitlement. Therefore, the Director of Legal Aid has the discretion under clause 8(3) of the Act to turn down such a case, because clause 8(3) says, \"The Director may refuse legal aid if it appears to him unreasonable that the applicant \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> should receive it in the particular circumstances of the case.\" I am sure that in such a case, he would exercise the discretion in that way. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 7 to 25 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and Second Schedules ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with an amendment, read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INSURANCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>2.22 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks specifically to introduce provisions to facilitate investigations into suspected drug money laundering activities. The new provisions are complementary to those in the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, which allows the investigation, tracing, freezing and seizure of proceeds from drug trafficking and provides legal assistance to foreign Government enforcement agencies on fulfilment of certain conditions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new provisions in the Bill would facilitate applications for production orders and granting of mutual assistance to foreign government agencies where a customer of an insurance company is involved in laundering drug money proceeds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to the Insurance Act is similar to the recent amendments under the Banking (Amendment) Act, the Finance Companies (Amendment) Act and the Futures Trading (Amendment) Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1355</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Companies Act, a company is required to send a copy of its last audited accounts, which comprises the profit and loss account, balance sheet and notes to the accounts, as well as the Auditor's Report and directors' report on those accounts to its shareholders before the general meeting at which these accounts are to be presented. This set of documents is commonly known as the annual report. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with this requirement can be a very costly affair, especially for companies with very large numbers of shareholders. Some shareholders are not interested in studying the full accounts of the company. There is even more wastage when a few copies of the full accounts and the director's report are received by a single household because family members living within the household are all shareholders of the same company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the existing Companies Act requires each shareholder to be issued one copy of the annual report, the company must send a copy of the annual report to each shareholder, even when the shareholder prefers not to be sent this annual report . \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem became more pronounced with the listing of large companies such as Singapore Telecom. With the listing of Singapore Telecom, many Singaporeans became shareholders. There arose a situation where a single household with members owning `B' or `C' shares could receive multiple copies of the same annual report, as each shareholder in the same household would receive a copy of the annual report. For shareholders who have bought the company's shares through different means, for instance, through their CPF account or by paying cash for the shares, the company would also recognise the shareholder as two \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> different persons. In such a scenario, the same shareholder could receive duplicate copies of the same annual report. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To alleviate the above problems, the Bill introduces a new section to allow a listed public company to send a summary financial statement to its members instead of its annual accounts and directors' reports. The objective of the amendment is to help reduce costs of sending annual reports to shareholders, without compromising a shareholder's right to financial information on the company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summary financial statement is a summary of financial information derived from the annual accounts and directors' reports of the company. It would comprise certain minimum information culled from the company's annual report, such as the balance sheet, profit and loss statement and shareholding statistics. Material changes in the company and the directors' interest in the company will also have to be highlighted to the shareholder. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the summary financial statement does not mislead the shareholders, the new section provides that the summary financial statement must contain an opinion by the company's auditor as to whether the summary financial statement is consistent with the company's annual accounts and directors' report and complies with the proposed new section and the regulations made under it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company is still obliged to send a copy of the full accounts to those members who request it. The new section does not derogate from the obligation of a company to present its full accounts and directors' report at its annual general meeting and thereafter to lodge these documents with the Registrar of Companies. As such, the amount of information on the company available to a shareholder will not be reduced by the proposed amendments. The new section provides that shareholders can always request the company to send them the full annual report, at no additional charge to the shareholder. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the problem of several copies of a summary financial statement being sent to the same household, the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> new section also provides that a summary financial statement need not be sent to any member who does not wish to receive it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When drafting the Bill, the views of members of the legal, accounting, banking and stock exchange communities on the proposed amendments have been sought. Both the Law Society and the Institute of Certified Public Accountants were in general agreement with the overall objective and rationale of the proposed amendments. The Association of Banks in Singapore, the Singapore Merchant Bankers Association and the Stock Exchange of Singapore have also supported the proposed amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom Companies Act has similar provisions to allow public listed companies to issue summary financial statements in lieu of full annual reports. The proposed amendments to the Companies Act follow closely the provisions in the UK Companies Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Sir, I support this Bill. It is often the case that annual reports are just thrown away by shareholders. So to save the trees, if for no other reason, this is a good innovation. I would just ask the Minister for clarification on two matters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, clause 203A(1) says that regulations will specify the conditions under which a summary financial statement can be sent in lieu of the full financial statement. Could the Minister please inform the House what these conditions will be? If we leave these things to regulations, it is not transparent what the situation will be. Is it every listed company that will be allowed to dispense with the sending of the full statement? Or is it only certain mega companies? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if the Minister would not mind clarifying, is the question of whether this is an opt-in or opt-out type situation. If we look at clause 203A(2), it seems to suggest that it is up to the shareholder to request for a summary financial statement. In other words, if he does not request it, then \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1358</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the normal rule is that the full statements will go out. Whereas listening to the Minister and looking at sub-clause (3), I get the impression that it is going to be a situation where we will get a summary statement unless we ask for the full accounts. What exactly is the position? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these two requests for clarification, I fully support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The first question Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon asked is whether the amendments apply to all companies. The answer is yes. All listed companies have the option to decide to send out summary statements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second question is that it is an opt-out scheme in which all shareholders will receive summary reports with an option letter in which they can respond to say whether they want to receive the full accounts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To elaborate on this, I will give into some details to enlighten the House. The regulations are being drafted and expected to be gazetted in about a month's time. They specify how a shareholder could indicate to the company his wishes to change his option to request for the full annual report or to opt out and not receive any report at all. The regulations would also specify certain minimum information that will be contained in the summary financial account statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main points of the regulations are as follows: In the first year of the issue of the summary financial statement, the company would have to provide all shareholders with a copy of the summary financial statement, together with a consultation letter, for them to indicate whether they would like to receive the full financial statement. Consultation letter will also allow shareholders to opt out from receiving any report in future years. Failure to respond to the consultation letter would be an indication to the company that the shareholder wishes to continue receiving summary financial statements in subsequent years. In the subsequent year, and for every year thereafter, the company must provide the shareholders the means to change his previous option to either receive the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> summary financial statement, the full financial report, or no report at all. The company must send an option form to shareholders, together with the summary financial statement or full financial report, to enable them to change their previous option. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For shareholders who have opted out of receiving any report, the company could either send the option letter directly to each shareholder or print a notice in the newspapers for use, whichever is the most cost-efficient means of disseminating the option form. If the shareholder does not respond to the option letter, the company could assume that the shareholder wishes to continue with his previous year's option. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all instances, the regulations would be drafted such that the shareholder will not incur any additional charges for changing his previous option or for opting to receive the full annual report, instead of the summary financial statement. The regulations will also enable a shareholder to communicate his wishes to change options in his own writing without resorting to the option form provided by the company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations will also specify that the summary financial statement must provide certain minimum information. This would include essential information on the company's performance, like company's balance sheet, profit and loss accounts, chairman's statement highlighting any material changes to the company's financial position, a summarised directors' report highlighting certain pertinent information on the directors, shareholders' statistics and a copy of the auditors' report. The detailed contents of the summary financial statement would be listed in the regulations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company's auditors will also have to give their opinion whether the summary financial statement is consistent with the full accounts and the directors' report and complies with the regulations. This will ensure that the summary financial statement does not present \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> misleading information and is inconsistent with the company's full accounts and directors' report. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like Assoc. Prof. Woon, I support this Bill. It minimises a lot of wastage. I would like the Minister to clarify on the question of the full financial statement that is requested by shareholders. Currently, under the present regulations, the report is received a certain number of days or period before the calling of the Annual General Meeting. But this regulation is not very clear. Because when a shareholder opts in to receive a report, will there be time for him to receive the report and analyze the report before attending the Annual General Meeting? The provision is not very clear as it says that the company is obliged to do that before the Annual General Meeting. There is no point in getting a report after the Annual General Meeting. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I assure the Member that adequate time will be allowed for a shareholder to decide whether to respond to the option as to whether or not he wants to have the full accounts.

The remaining PUB will continue to manage the Water Department, and be the regulator responsible for licensing and regulating the privatised electricity and piped gas industries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new company's name has now been finalised, and will be known as Singapore Power Pte Ltd (SP). SP will be a holding company, with five operating subsidiaries, viz, two power generating companies, a transmission and distribution company, an electricity supply company that will be responsible for buying electricity from the power generators and selling it to the customers, and a gas company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government plans to list SP on the Singapore Stock Exchange around the middle of next year. This 5-subsidiary structure will allow the Government to introduce competition in electricity generation and supply progressively over the next few years while, at the same time, enabling SP to tap the combined resources of its subsidiaries for projects overseas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I informed the House then, the PUB privatisation is part of the Government's plan to enhance the assets of Singaporeans and give them a stake in the country's wealth. As in the Singapore Telecom flotation, we will have a scheme to encourage Singaporeans to buy the shares of SP, and hold on to them. As a privatised company, SP will have the operational flexibility to be more market-oriented in tailoring its services to better meet the needs of its customers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, PUB is now both a regulator and an operator of electricity services in Singapore. It has done well in giving Singaporeans a reliable and efficient service at prices which are very competitive by international standards. However, this present structure is workable so long as PUB remains as a statutory board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After privatisation, the Board of Directors of SP will have the fiduciary responsibility to maximise profits and to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> look after the interests of SP's shareholders. The degree of SP's monopoly power will undoubtedly influence its ability to maximise profits. This is an economic fact, and does not in any way reflect on the professionalism of SP's present or future management. PUB will therefore need to regulate the privatised utility companies and safeguard the interests of consumers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another safeguard will be the introduction of competition. In planning for the privatisation of PUB, the Ministry of Trade and Industry studied the experience of the UK when it privatised its electricity and gas services. The key lesson from the UK experience was that regulatory and competition policies should be carefully thought through and settled before privatisation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's present power generating capacity is about 4.5 GW, and is expected to more than double to 10 GW in 10 years' time. This enlarged generating capacity is sufficient to accommodate competition, as shown by the experience in various countries. For example, Northern Ireland, with a capacity of only 2.2 GW, has already introduced competition. Hong Kong, with a total generating capacity of 10.1 GW, has had two power generating companies for many years. And both New Zealand and the Australian state of Victoria, with a generating capacity of 7 GW each, are currently restructuring their electricity services to introduce competition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having more than one power generating company will encourage them to compete by being more innovative and efficient, and keep each other in check. By structuring SP's current power generating operations into two separate companies, we will be able to achieve some degree of competition immediately. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the completion of Stage 1 of the new Tuas Power Station (TPS) in 1999 will give us an opportunity to introduce additional competition into the electricity generation business. TPS will be built in two stages, each with a generating capacity of 1.2 GW. With the completion of Stage 2 by the year 2001, TPS will be about the same size as each of the two SP power generating subsidiaries. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has kept the Tuas power project separate from SP, under the ownership of Temasek Holdings. SP will manage the construction and commissioning of the Tuas project on behalf of Temasek. When TPS is completed, the Government will then have the flexibility to sell TPS to a non-SP group, if it so decides, without affecting the structure of SP. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not be able to introduce competition in transmission and distribution, as these are natural monopolies. Nor will we need to introduce competition in piped gas services, as there is already competition from bottled LPG. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go into the key provisions of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill re-constitutes the PUB as a statutory board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 sets out the functions, duties and powers of the re-constituted PUB. It empowers the PUB to manage and operate the Water Department. The PUB will promote competition and exercise licensing and regulatory functions over the electricity and piped gas industries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 61 provides for the corporatisation of PUB's Electricity and Gas Departments. The Government will wholly own the shares of the corporatised SP. PUB will transfer the necessary properties, rights and liabilities to SP, and its five subsidiary companies, for them to operate the electricity and piped gas businesses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 66 provides for the existing staff to be transferred to the successor companies on terms which are no less favourable than those enjoyed by them before the transfer. This is fair, and will enable the successor companies to continue operating without any disruption. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 64 and 65 of the Bill enable the Government to offer for sale to the public the shares or debentures of SP. As I mentioned earlier, the Government expects to list SP around the middle of next year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38 provides for PUB, as the regulator, to grant licences for electricity generation, transmission and supply, and for the provision of utilities support services. The licences will contain conditions relating to service standards and reliability, public safety and other relevant matters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electricity transmission licensee, who will have a monopoly over the transmission and distribution network, will be required under clause 47(2)(b) of the Bill to make its network available to all generation and supply licensees on fair terms. This ensures that future power generation companies will enjoy terms and access into the power transmission and distribution system similar to that enjoyed by companies in the SP stable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 38(5)(d) and 50(1) provide for PUB to regulate electricity tariff rates. PUB, as the regulator, will establish a formula which will set a limit for any increases in the electricity rates. This would be especially useful during the next few years when competition in the electricity industry remains limited. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, large consumers whose maximum demand exceeds a certain level will be given the choice not to come under the regulated tariffs. They can enter into special agreements with any electricity supplier. The rationale is that large consumers will have the negotiating power to \"shop around\" for the supplier that can offer them the best deal in terms of prices and services. Clause 54 of the Bill provides for this flexibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of Singapore's strength is that we have a secure and reliable supply of electricity. This not only enables us to lead our daily lives with minimal inconveniences but, more important, is critical for the smooth operation of our business and industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, one of the duties of the re-constituted PUB is to ensure that this strength is not compromised. PUB will work closely with the power generators to forecast electricity demand and ensure that the additional generating capacity needed is secured in good time. This is to safeguard against any market failure \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> should companies fail to respond quick enough to market signals to install new generation capacity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable PUB to do this, clause 44 empowers PUB to give directions to licensees with respect to standards of performance and service, including ensuring the security and reliability of supply. If they fail to discharge their obligations and the security of electricity supply to the public is threatened, clauses 44, 58 and 59 empower PUB to fine them, suspend or cancel their licences and, ultimately, to assume control of their businesses if the need arises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now briefly explain the regulatory framework for the privatised piped gas industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier in my speech, there is already an open gas market, with consumers choosing freely between PUB's piped gas where it is available, and the many bottled gas suppliers. Consequently, the regulatory framework for the privatised piped gas business will mainly address the safety aspects of gas production and transmission, the quality of the gas and the standard of performance of the licensed piped gas company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the supply of water. As the re-constituted PUB's role with regard to water supply has not changed, the Bill has retained basically the same provisions as in the existing Public Utilities Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB has done a commendable job in providing Singapore with a reliable and efficient electricity and piped gas supply. The passing of this Bill will launch PUB and its successor companies into a new phase of development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will provide Singaporeans the opportunity to have yet another tangible stake in our nation's wealth. At the same time, the successor companies will have greater management flexibility to innovate and meet the local demands for electricity and piped gas in an even more efficient manner. It will also have greater flexibility to compete and venture into the regional power market. I therefore hope Members will give their full support to this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONTACT LENS PRACTITIONERS BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.25 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry had announced in a press statement in February 1990 that we intend to introduce legislation to control the practice of contact lens in Singapore by 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was prompted by a number of reports of eye injuries and infections from the improper use of contact lens. A survey conducted by my Ministry in 1988 had revealed 320 cases of eye complications from contact lens, 23 of which were corneal ulcers which could have led to blindness if they had not been diagnosed and treated early. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another survey in 1992 showed that out of 194 cases of contact lens related complications seen within a 6-month period at the Singapore National Eye Centre, six cases required hospitalisation for complications including corneal ulcers, corneal abscesses and corneal abrasions. The Eye Clinic at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital also reported three cases of corneal abscesses from contact lens use in the same year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my Ministry realised that at that time the number of qualified contact lens practitioners and optometrists in Singapore was not sufficiently large to meet the demands of the large number of contact lens users (estimated at 150,000 to 200,000) and that immediate legislation could cause hardship to the existing practitioners and inconveniences to the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> So my Ministry embarked on a step-by-step approach to address this problem. I shall now outline the steps that we have taken since then. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Part-time Certificate Courses</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, my Ministry arranged with the Singapore Polytechnic for the Polytechnic to offer a special 2-year part-time certificate course on contact lens practice (CCLP) to upgrade the existing practitioners. This course was started in 1990 and attracted a total of 303 applications from 278 optical shops. Of these, about 180 candidates met the entrance requirements and were accepted into the course in batches from 1990 onwards. The CCLP course has since produced 133 qualified contact lens practitioners. A final batch of about 20 will obtain their certificates this year. In addition, another group of 20 private students had also passed the examination at the Singapore Polytechnic. So the total number of existing practitioners who have benefitted from the programme is about 170. Besides these, there are also at present about 70 existing qualified optometrists in Singapore who have the necessary training to practise contact lens. Altogether, these 240 or so qualified persons would form the core of qualified persons who can carry out contact lens practice under the proposed legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Diploma in Optometry</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a follow-up to this upgrading certificate course, my Ministry had also arranged with the Singapore Polytechnic to start an optometry diploma course at the Singapore Polytechnic to meet the future requirements of optometrists and contact lens practitioners. This 3-year full-time diploma course has formalised the optometric education in Singapore with yearly intakes of about 40 students who have good \"O\" level qualifications. The first batch for this diploma course was enroled in 1994 and is expected to graduate in 1997. With this course, we can expect to have a steady supply of about 40 qualified optometrists and contact lens practitioners each year from 1997 onwards. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Other Safety Measures</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a third measure, we have been promoting patient vision care through the Singapore National Eye Centre and other departments under my Ministry. After we started the contact lens upgrading course in 1990, we have worked with the Registry of Companies and Businesses to prevent unqualified persons from setting up new contact lens practices. Regulations under the Medicines Act have also been introduced to control the quality and sterility of contact lens solutions sold in Singapore. In addition, my Ministry has worked with SISIR to come up with a Singapore Standard on Contact Lens to set quality specifications for contact lens. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these programmes in place, the time is now right for legislation to control contact lens practice in Singapore. This Bill is specifically drafted to meet this objective. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must stress at this point that this new legislation is not intended to control the dispensing and fitting of spectacles. Existing opticians who are not qualified to deal with or fit contact lens will still be allowed to continue their business in the fitting and selling of spectacles. This is because spectacles do not come into direct contact with the eyes and do not pose the same level of hazard as contact lenses. So, optical shops that deal only with spectacles need not fear that this new legislation may jeopardise their livelihood. Those who also deal with contact lenses will, however, have to ensure that they have qualified contact lens practitioners to continue to provide this service. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Scope of Control</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the scope of this control, my Ministry has received feedback and submissions from various optical and optometric bodies. We have met with representatives of the Singapore Optometric Association, Singapore Contact Lens Society and Singapore Society of Optometrists. We have sought their views, as well as those of ophthalmologists, academicians and so on, on various aspects of the proposed legislation. From these discussions, it was clear that while there is general support for the legislation, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> there are some who advocate a comprehensive control of all opticians, contact lens practitioners, as well as optometrists. There are also others who are apprehensive of the extent of control and have asked for special exemptions and a \"grandfather's clause\" to allow existing opticians to continue their practice in contact lens without having to pass examinations or attend the Singapore Polytechnic's certificate course. My Ministry has considered all these proposals very carefully in drafting the Bill. However, after thorough consideration, we have come to the conclusion that these additional proposals cannot be accepted. I will now explain the reasons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, to extend the control to cover all opticians and optometrists will be outside the scope of this programme, which is to prevent the danger of injuries posed by the improper use of contact lens. As I have explained earlier, spectacles do not come into direct contact with the eyes and do not pose the same dangers as contact lens to the eyes. It is not the intention of my Ministry to legislate all activities and services that are related to health unless there is clear evidence of hazard, abuse or misuse. Otherwise, we will raise the costs to the public unnecessarily. There is at present no compelling reason to register opticians who do not deal in contact lens. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Grandfather's Clause</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the request for a \"grandfather's clause\", this would be defeating the purpose of the Singapore Polytechnic's upgrading certificate course, and would be manifestly unfair to all those who have undergone this course since 1990. It would also defeat the purpose of the Bill which seeks to ensure competence in contact lens practice for the safety of the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Optometry Diploma Course</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the adequacy of the Singapore Polytechnic's Optometry Diploma Course has also been criticised by some who advocate a University degree course in optometry. I would like to reiterate that the Singapore Polytechnic's Diploma in Optometry is recognised by my Ministry \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> as adequate training for optometry in Singapore, and is also acceptable under the proposed Bill for contact lens practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>University Degree</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of setting up a University course in optometry in Singapore has been repeatedly raised by the Singapore Optometric Association and the Singapore Contact Lens Society. They have even lobbied for support from overseas professional organisations. They have written to the press and to my Ministry to urge us to adopt their approach in this matter. I think it is useful for me to elaborate on why this approach is not as necessary or as sound as it appears. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, eyecare is provided by a whole range of providers ranging from opticians, contact lens practitioners, optometrists, general practice doctors to ophthalmologists. This wide range of providers caters to the many different needs for different levels of eyecare services, and not all of them need to be University trained. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4></h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we need to consider the local situation and requirements in Singapore. In larger countries, where geographical distance is a problem, some medical personnel such as nurse practitioners are allowed to undertake certain diagnostic and curative procedures where the services of a medical doctor are either not required or not readily available. In contrast, Singapore is small and our doctors and ophthalmologists are easily accessible to the population to deal with any eye injuries and diseases. Granted that we do need a number of graduate nurses and optometrists to provide leadership in these professions, there is no special need at present for us to train all our nurses and all our optometrists to University level. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, upgrading of any profession must be done in a step-by-step fashion and in a practical way. For example, we went through similar steps in the training of dentists, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and radiographers. Most professions started with some kind of certificate course and may progress to diplomas and degrees as appropriate in stages. These diploma and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> certificate courses would serve to upgrade the training of these healthcare personnel and would help us meet the manpower needs of the country. They are the necessary steps we need to take in upgrading these services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must consider the practical effects of upgrading. Too fast a pace of upgrading will have a disruptive effect on existing practitioners and will have serious cost-implications to the general public. Within safety limits, we should not unduly confine the public's choice by restricting optometry and contact lens practice only to University graduates. In short, we will continue to encourage upgrading, but this must be done in a way which is practical and does not raise costs unnecessarily to members of the public. Too much regulation will also create market inefficiency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now deal with the major provisions of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Contact Lens Practitioners Board</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this proposed Bill, a Contact Lens Practitioners Board will be set up. Its major functions are to maintain a register of persons qualified to prescribe, dispense and fit contact lens; to approve acceptable qualifications and training; and to regulate the practice and institute disciplinary proceedings. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Qualifications for Registration</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board may approve any qualifications or training including the Singapore Polytechnic's certificate and diploma, as well as specific overseas qualifications, as acceptable qualifications for registration. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Annual Licences</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar of the Board will grant annual licences to all registered contact lens practitioners. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Provisional Licences</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill provides for a transitional arrangement. Those practitioners who have registered to undergo or are still undergoing the Singapore Polytechnic's \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Certificate Course or any other approved course will be granted provisional licences to continue their practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Offences and Penalties</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 16, 18 and 20 specify the offences and penalties under the Bill. Offences include engaging in the practice of contact lens fitting without a valid licence or allowing premises to be used by such persons to practise. For such offence, the penalties are a fine of not exceeding $10,000 or a jail term of not exceeding six months, or both. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for administering any prescription containing any poison or controlled drug without authorization is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or a jail term not exceeding two years, or both. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for selling or supplying contact lens without being a registered contact lens practitioner is a fine of not exceeding $5,000 or a jail term of not exceeding six months, or both. However, manufacturers and wholesalers are allowed to supply contact lens to registered contact lens practitioners, or for export. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Referral of Eye Injuries and Diseases</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that proper medical care is provided for eye injuries and diseases, registered contact lens practitioners are required under clause 19 of the Bill to refer clients who are suffering from an injury or disease of the eye to ophthalmologists for medical advice and treatment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Power of Board to Discipline</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 12 and 13 stipulate the power of the Board. This includes removal of names from the register, caution, censure, suspension or fine. Any person who is aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal to the Minister within one month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Contact Lens Practitioners Bill will ensure safe and competent contact lens services to the public and prevent injuries to the eyes from contact lenses which are improperly fitted or used. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1373</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact lens use became a vogue some 10 years ago when prominent Singaporeans started wearing them. Many young people and those who want to look young and presentable wear contact lens. However, it is not for vanity alone that people wear contact lens. The use of contact lens, instead of spectacles, can help slow down the deterioration rate of poor eyesight. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question we ask is: why do we take so long to register and regulate the standard of contact lens practice? The pair of eyes is a vital organ for all of us. The loss of sight of one eye, according to the Schedule of the Workmen's Compensation Act, is 50% loss of earning capacity. The total loss of sight is treated as total permanent disability and equivalent to 100% loss of earning capacity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill highlights the dangers and risks involved in the fitting of contact lens. And utmost care is needed for both the practitioners and users to prevent injuries and disease to the precious eyes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far the situation is under control. As our society becomes more sophisticated, we would expect more users of contact lens. I would envisage that the contact lens market will be a lucrative one in the future. Therefore, the Bill is very timely to ensure that from now on, only trained and qualified people are allowed to set up practice in contact lens. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the effort put in by the Ministry to balance the interest of public safety and the cost of use of contact lens. Many contact lens wearers are students and young adults. They have become necessary items to individuals who need to wear them for doing certain kinds of work and in occupations that make the wearing of spectacles inappropriate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the step-by-step approach taken by the Ministry of Health to help as many of the existing practitioners as possible to be trained and qualified for continued practice. This is to ensure that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> there is no sudden reduction in the number of shops supplying the needs of contact lens users, as otherwise the cost of contact lens may shoot up and this is not in the interest of the consuming public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact lenses are also fashion items. Some people use them not to correct vision but, as we have read, to enhance the colour of their eyes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if it is possible from now on for disposable contact lens to be freely available over the counter in pharmacies and optical shops. From now, are contact lens considered controlled items? Are consumers allowed to self-administer, buying the contact lens on their own and fitting them themselves? Is there a difference between disposable and non-disposable contact lens and those contact lens that correctvision and those that do not? Are they all encompassing? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the Senior Minister of State please clarify the practical difficulties in enforcing the provisions? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Mr Loh Meng See, Chairman of the GPC for Health, for his support for this Bill and the step-by-step approach my Ministry has taken to balance the interest of the public as well as the cost implications. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked what we intend to do should disposable contact lens become widely used in Singapore. I am aware that some people wear contact lens for aesthetic reasons. But whether it is worn to correct vision, or because some people need them for certain types of occupations, or wear them mainly for fashionable reasons such as to change the colour of their eyes, as Mr Loh pointed out, the fact is, contact lens are in contact with the eyeballs, in contact with the cornea. So for all practical purposes, the dispensing of all contact lens should be brought under this Bill. I think it is far safer for members of the public to see a qualified optometrist to have the contact lens fitted and to have proper checks done periodically in order to prevent any infections from arising or to detect any injuries that might have resulted from the improper use of the lens. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Aline K.

It is not unusual now for MNCs and industrialists in the region to use Jurong Industrial Estate as a benchmark when they assess the suitability of a particular location for their new investment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not surprising that when our own businessmen started to venture into the development of industrial estates in the region, some of them turned to JTC for services ranging from consultancy to project development and management. Just as our private sector has found that the rapid economic growth in the region has created many attractive business opportunities, so too has JTC as it ventured abroad in support of the private sector and the Government's efforts to create an external economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, JTC has found that, for it to perform efficiently and to be able to add greater value as a partner to the private \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sector in their overseas ventures, its statutory powers would have to be enlarged. This is not surprising, as the JTC Act was enacted at a time when we were just embarking on our own industrialisation programme, and few could have dreamt of the drastically changed circumstances prevailing in the East Asia region today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill aims to rectify the situation by seeking to amend the JTC Act to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) widen JTC's overseas charter; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) give JTC greater flexibility in financial matters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also taken this opportunity to amend certain provisions in the existing Act to give JTC greater flexibility in its daily administration and operation, and to bring the JTC Act up to date. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now brief Members on the key provisions in the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of JTC, as provided for in the current Act, are to develop and manage industrial estates and sites in Singapore or overseas, and to provide supporting facilities and social amenities. However, JTC has found that, for larger scale projects abroad, the scope of work extends beyond just developing and managing an industrial estate. For such project to be feasible and successful, the developer may also have to develop and manage infrastructural facilities such as bridges, warehouses, ports, power supply networks and commercial and residential properties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill re-enacts with amendments section 12 of the JTC Act which sets out the functions and powers of JTC. The new section 12 enlarges the functions of JTC and gives it additional powers for the carrying out of those functions. This amendment will enable JTC to provide the full range of services needed in its regional activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for JTC to carry out its functions more effectively in today's competitive environment, it is also necessary to provide JTC with greater financial flexibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, from time to time, JTC and its subsidiaries have been approached by various Singapore companies to participate in their projects as an equity partner. The companies would be able to spread the project risks and financial commitment, and the projects themselves would benefit from the good reputation of JTC. However, even though these projects may be commercially viable and attractive, the current Act does not allow JTC to participate in ventures in which it has a minority shareholding. There may also be occasions when JTC, having identified a project on its own, would not want to be a majority shareholder but still would like to participate in the project, or may want to divest part of its shares to other Singapore partners. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act also requires these JTC subsidiaries to share the functions of JTC as set out in the existing Act. There is also no reason to compel JTC's subsidiaries to share the functions of JTC itself as long as the activities they engage in are commercially viable and fit in with JTC's long-term corporate strategies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act also does not allow JTC to grant loans to companies in which its subsidiaries have an equity stake. Neither does it allow JTC to stand as a guarantor for loans to these companies or its own subsidiaries. JTC, therefore, faces severe constraints in providing financial support to its subsidiaries in their local and overseas ventures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give JTC more financial flexibility, clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 12 of the JTC Act to allow JTC, with the Minister's approval, to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) participate as a shareholder in companies for both local and overseas ventures without setting any conditions on the extent of its shareholding; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) grant loans or stand as a guarantor for loans to its subsidiaries and the companies in which the subsidiaries have equity participation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments will give JTC the flexibility to participate as a shareholder in any project which is commercially attractive and viable, and fits in JTC's corporate strategies, and which can benefit from JTC's expertise and experience. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give JTC access to more sources of funds to support its local and regional activities, clause 5 of the Bill seeks to amend sections 14 and 15 of the JTC Act to allow JTC, with the Minister's approval, to raise funds using financial instruments other than mortgages, stocks and bonds as stated in the current JTC Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, JTC is now allowed to only invest in trust funds, as provided by section 4 of the Trustees Act. Clause 10 re-enacts with amendments section 26 to allow JTC to invest in trust funds and, with the approval of the Minister, in any other securities. This change is in line with the Government's call for statutory boards to tap the capital markets for funding activities and to seek fund management services to invest their cash surpluses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5(1) of the present JTC Act states that the JTC Board must comprise a Chairman, Deputy Chairman and seven members. This means that JTC cannot vary the size of its Board according to its needs. Clause 2(a) of the Bill amends this section to give JTC more flexibility by stipulating the composition of the Board as a Chairman and not less than 4 but not more than 11 members, one of whom may be appointed as the Deputy Chairman. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we have to amend the JTC Act each time JTC changes its corporate logo. This is rather cumbersome and inefficient. Clause 12 of the Bill amends section 35 to allow JTC to change its logo by notification in the Gazette. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also amends certain provisions in the JTC Act to bring them up to date. These are mainly administrative in nature. They include submission deadlines on JTC's budget and annual report to the Minister and JTC's audited financial statements to the President. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment to the Jurong Town Corporation Act is a timely one for several reasons. Apart from the administrative amendments such as the number of Board members, submission of the annual \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> report, etc, the main thrust of the amendment is to empower JTC to carry out functions which are better suited to the current and future development needs of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the amendment empowers JTC to develop and manage not only industrial estates but also parks and estates for industries as well as businesses. In Singapore itself, the regionalisation of plant line operation has converted the Singapore operations into headquarter activities involving marketing, procurement, technical and administrative support. Manufacturing functions are increasingly becoming blended into R&amp;D and producer services in one continuous spectrum; as such, business parks of the 1990's version of the industrial estate of the 1960s. In addition, more capital and technology intensive manufacturing sites such as for wafer fabrication are required. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the amendment Bill provides for the participation of JTC in overseas ventures and development. One key regionalisation thrust has been the development of industrial estates and townships outside Singapore such as in Batam and Suzhou. This is a win-win situation. The host country benefits in the technology transfer, both in terms of the hardware and the software of Singapore's successful experience in the development and management of industrial townships. The window of opportunity is now at this crucial stage of industrialisation in the emerging economies of China, India, Vietnam and, possibly, Myanmar later on. Foreign investors, including Singapore-based companies, likewise benefit because of the ease of establishment of their operations in the host country. There are also returns to Singapore from the development and operation of the industrial park itself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the amendment allows JTC to \"act in combination or association with other persons or organisations for the discharge of any of its functions\" (clause 4(2)(a)); and \"to form or participate in the formation of a company or companies or enter into any joint venture or partnership \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in Singapore or elsewhere\" (clause 4(2)(j)). This enables JTC itself to enter into joint ventures with local and foreign companies in a consortium approach to the development of industrial parks abroad. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add a number of footnotes which constitute qualifiers and these observations come from a study of infrastructure development in Singapore which I did a year ago. JTC not only has got to watch out for its own bottom line but has a role to fulfil as a key public sector agency. I see three major developmental roles for JTC. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first developmental responsibility is domestic. The stated objective of the Government is to sustain the manufacturing sector - at least 25% of GDP. JTC has a key role to play in helping to fulfil this objective. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly agree with the statement in JTC's Annual Report 1993/94 that there is a new resolve in JTC to become more customer focused. The report goes on to add that JTC carried out a review of land pricing and leasing policy to ensure that they are relevant in today's context. Specifically, the cap on annual rent escalation was reduced from 10% to 7.6%, and rentals of standard and flatted factory space were frozen for the second year in 1994, even in spite of these rents being at least 15% lower than comparable private sector rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land pricing and rentals as well as the entire building regulatory framework do affect the competitiveness of Singapore's manufacturing. It is a difficult and sensitive task to balance excess demand induced price increases due to land scarcity on the one hand, and the need to price land in order to offer investors a competitive package on the other. This involves more agencies than just JTC. I would therefore urge the Government to initiate a comprehensive study of land pricing, land usage and the associated regulatory framework in Singapore involving all the relevant agencies in consultation with key private sector companies in order to facilitate the implementation of appropriate policies in this area. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second developmental responsibility is in the area of human resources development. I see JTC as a training ground for the building up of a core of engineering, managerial and specialist staff, which constitute a valuable asset to Singapore, both domestically and overseas. Some of these expertise can, over time, be released to the private sector to the benefit of the country at large. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third developmental responsibility is the nurturing of local companies. In the many projects that JTC handles domestically and abroad, it is important that JTC considers how it can help local companies establish track records and broaden their job experiences. The consortium approach is one way. Sub-contracting out certain tasks such as waste management is another. JTC already incorporates some or all of these measures. It should continue to do so as an integral part of its mission. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Jurong Town Corporation (Amendment) Bill enables JTC to deepen and broaden its functions in response to Singapore's own current and future development needs as well as the opportunities in the rapidly growing Asia-Pacific region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these footnotes in mind, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill which gives JTC some flexibility in its operations. But I would like the Minister to exercise some caution in allowing JTC subsidiary companies to invest abroad. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a contrary view on this. I am not sure whether the JTC has the culture, manpower or the expertise to invest abroad. The conditions in countries overseas are quite different. Our laws are very definite. Our people in JTC know what they are doing in Singapore. But in China or in India, the rules and laws are not that precise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we have a situation where the JTC is allowed, of course, with the Minister's approval, not just equity participation but also allowed to guarantee loans. This is a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> very serious matter. Because in the case of a major political upheaval, the Government could be placed in a very embarrassing position. I would prefer a provision to allow JTC to set up subsidiaries which will work in conjunction with Government-linked companies as an investor, and provide the expertise, rather than be a direct investor and guaranteeing loans in the development projects. I would like the Minister to keep that in mind and give this House a suitable response. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, first of all, I would like to thank the two Members for their support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee has made three points. Firstly, that the pricing of land is a very complex and sensitive issue and that we should have a multi-agency to do a comprehensive study of the situation and see how we can ensure that the land pricing is in line with Government policies. I agree with her that this is a highly complex issue. On the one hand, we are faced with the problem of having very limited land and therefore it is inevitable that land prices in Singapore will always be high. On the other hand, we have the important task of ensuring that our manufacturing sector will be responsible for no less than 25% of our GDP. So how do we ensure that the prices of industrial land do not cause our key export industries to become non-competitive? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in land-scarce Singapore, we will always have to ensure that land is used efficiently, optimally and that wastage is minimised. One method for ensuring this is, of course, having proper planning procedures. This is being done. Another essential method is to ensure that the pricing is correct, so that the owners and lessees make full use of every square metre of land that they lease. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are ways for establishing the correct market price. For commercial and private residential properties, we have a very vibrant private sector. Transactions are done almost every day. The market price is fairly well established. Also, the URA periodically tenders out Government land. I think that sets another benchmark for the price of such land. For industrial \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> properties, we have a small proportion of industrial land held by the private sector. These are mainly in the MacPherson area and along certain parts of Bukit Timah Road. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two years, URA has also tendered out some plots of land for industrial use. This gives us a rough indicator of what should be the market price for industrial land. I would also like to assure Dr Lee that we do monitor the prices of industrial land in Singapore as well as the prices of industrial land in our key competitive countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, China, India and even in America. But we must always recognise that land prices in Singapore can never be as cheap as land prices, including industrial land prices, in those countries with much bigger land areas. Because land is such a vital resource, I am happy to inform Dr Lee that we already have a multi-agency committee that plans land usage in Singapore. For example, in a particular area, what sort of land usage should be allowed and also the intensity of the land usage. The planning process ensures that the land is utilised properly and it also ensures that if a particular land has been gazetted or master planned for industrial uses, then the land pricing there would be different from land which has been master planned for residential or commercial development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As JTC has stated in its annual report, they do try to ensure that their land prices are competitive. But at the end of the day, we will never be close to the land prices in our surrounding countries. The challenge to us, therefore, is to ensure that we are able to make that higher price bearable for the private sector, by making the infrastructure efficient so that the industries have a lower cost of operation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter is that we have to continue attracting investors who bring in efficient productive operations and who are carrying out high value-added activities. So MTI will continue to monitor, together with JTC and EDB, the various prices to make sure that we are actually competitive. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards her other point on the release of JTC expertise to the private sector, I totally agree with her. Actually, JTC is working very actively with the private sector on various projects in the region, offering their consultancy services and they also have been losing their professionals to the private sector. The private sector realises that there is expertise in JTC and they have not hesitated to poach from JTC when the need arises. In a way, JTC is also performing some national service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of nurturing local companies by sub-contracting more work to them, JTC is already doing so. I can assure Dr Lee that it will continue to review and see what else can be sub-contracted out. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok advises that with the very complicated operating environment abroad, he is not too sure whether JTC has the corporate culture and expertise to invest abroad. I wish to assure Mr Chng that, in the first place, JTC has already been operating abroad through its subsidiaries and directly as a statutory board for many, many years. It has been involved in providing consultancy services in the development of industrial estates in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, China and now India as well. So they do have the expertise. But having said that, I do agree with him that we need to be cautious. I can assure him that we will definitely exercise caution when reviewing requests from JTC to participate as equity partners in the projects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments that I have moved today are to ensure that JTC can actually participate as a minority partner, ie, the projects would be driven by either the private sector companies or GLCs, and JTC is there with a small stake, but more in its role as a consultant to the project. I agree with him that we should be cautious. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>REGULATIONS OF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regulation of Imports and Exports Bill provides for the registration, regulation and control of imports into and exports from Singapore. This Bill consolidates and updates two existing statutes, namely, the Control of Imports and Exports Act (Cap 56), which I will call \"Control Act\" for short, and the Registration of Imports and Exports Act (Cap 270), which I will call \"Registration Act\" for short. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>4.15 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the \"Registration Act\" was enacted in 1934, and the \"Control Act\" in 1950. The last time both Acts were amended was in 1982, to allow for the establishment of the Trade Development Board. Other than the 1982 amendments which were mainly administrative in nature, there has not been any major amendment to either of the two existing Acts since their enactment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the trading environment in Singapore has changed significantly in the past four to five decades since the introduction of these two statutes. Singapore is now a major international trading hub. Both the volume and value of trade have increased in quantum leaps, in tandem with the growing global importance of our air and sea ports. The advent of electronic media for trade documentation adds a new dimension and poses additional challenges for trade regulation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive review of the two Acts was therefore necessary so as to bring the legislation in line with the prevailing trade environment and to facilitate the use of information technology. The fusion of these two Acts into a single piece of legislation would greatly facilitate and enhance the administration of our import and export trade. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, the main provisions of the two existing Acts will continue to be in force. However, the provisions have been consolidated to eliminate duplication and enhance clarity, especially where the two Acts overlap, so as to facilitate easier referencing and administration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administratively, at present, traders in Singapore have to complete a combined declaration form in compliance with the requirements under both existing Acts. However, traders are unsure which part of the declaration refers to which Act. A single Act eliminates such doubt and uncertainty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting this consolidated Bill, my Ministry has also taken the opportunity to bring the law up to date and to enact new provisions in line with Singapore's status as an international trading centre. Hence, new provisions have been included: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, governing the use of electronic media, ie, TradeNet, for the submission and receiving of trade documents between the traders and the authorities; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, for the registration of entities concerned with trade; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to update penalties so as to be in line with other commercial crimes and offences; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, to specify conditions upon which disclosure may be made to foreign government authorities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now go into the key provisions of the Bill. Provisions under the two existing Acts governing the use of the TradeNet system are inadequate. Not only does it fail to deal with the novel legal issues posed by TradeNet, it also does not completely cover many other trade documents that are currently submitted electronically for administrative convenience. This Bill enhances the legislative framework governing the transmission and use of electronic data for trade documentation whilst providing safeguards for the electronic age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 of this Bill penalizes the unauthorised modification of computer programmes or data. This includes the destruction, damage, erasure, or insertion \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of computer viruses into the system. This offence is punishable by a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both. Providing new enforcement powers, safeguards and penalties will enhance confidence in the system and encourage increased use of the electronic medium. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of this Bill empowers the Trade Development Board to create a register of importers, exporters or common carriers of goods. With the establishment of a register, the recalcitrant trader faces deregistration and the loss of associated trading privileges; this would heighten the risks and cost of illegal activities and serve as another deterrent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the two existing Acts were enacted more than 40 years ago. The penalties provided for in the two Acts are now outdated and inadequate in the context of today's trading environment. There is thus a need to review the penalties so as to bring them in line with other commercial crimes and offences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under the \"Registration Act\", the maximum penalty ranges from $1,000 up to a maximum of a mere $2,000. The maximum penalty under the \"Control Act\", for the first offence is $10,000 or three times the value of the goods in respect of which the offence was committed, whichever is the greater, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. For the second and subsequent offence, it is a fine not exceeding $20,000 or four times the value of the goods, whichever is the greater, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3(3) of this Bill increases the penalties to a maximum fine of $100,000 or three times the value of the goods, whichever is the higher, or two years' imprisonment or both for the first offence. For the second and subsequent offence, the penalties have been increased to a maximum fine of $200,000 or four times the value of the goods, whichever is the greater, and a maximum of three years' imprisonment or both. Hence, with the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> consolidation of the two existing Acts and these revisions, we are now able to impose a common set of realistic penalties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently there exists in the \"Control Act\" under section 17 an explicit provision that the powers of search are not applicable to a passenger while he is on board a vessel and in transit through Singapore to a destination outside Singapore. This restriction has been omitted from clause 21 of the new Bill, thereby allowing the search of transit passengers for contraband and other illegal goods such as narcotics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, the Registration of Import and Export Rules refer only to the importer or exporter of goods obtaining the relevant inward or outward declaration. Increasingly, freight forwarders and cargo agents are submitting trade declarations to the TDB on behalf of the trader. However, if there are errors in these declarations, it is the importer or exporter who is held liable even though it may not have been his fault and he did not sign the declaration himself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 of the Bill aims to rectify this inequity. It provides that, in instances where the documents are submitted or declared by an agent, the agent is presumed to do so on his principal's authority. The person who signs the document is also deemed to be cognizant of all matters therein and may be held liable for their actions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the two existing Acts provide that information, particulars or documents that have been supplied by the importer or exporter cannot be released without the prior consent in writing of the importer or exporter, except for purposes of a prosecution in Singapore. Clause 31 now provides for this provision to be widened to allow the disclosure of such information to a foreign government authority if certain conditions are met. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine conditions, as stipulated in clause 31(1)(4), serve as a safeguard to ensure that information is judiciously released and only for specific purposes that are not prejudicial to Singapore's essential interests. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I wish to point out that this new Bill addresses the major trends in trade technology. By facilitating the increased use of information technology, this Bill brings Singapore to the forefront in the use of electronic data in trade. The enhanced penalties and powers will help combat spurious and illegitimate use of Singapore's open trading system. Traders will also find that with this one consolidated Bill, the trading process is simplified and there is greater clarity in the procedures. The Regulation of Imports and Exports Bill will, therefore, remove impediments to trading activities and, in turn, further enhance Singapore's position as a thriving international trading hub. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LAND TITLES (STRATA) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary objective of the Bill is to amend the Land titles (Strata) Act to provide the legal framework to enable the conversion of the leases of flats in designated HUDC estates to strata titles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conversion will allow HUDC residents to enjoy the status and advantages of private property owners. It is part of the Government's asset enhancement programme. It will also serve to meet the rising aspirations of Singaporeans for private housing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon privatisation, the HUDC owners will have ownership of their respective strata units and own, as tenants-in-common, the common property such as car parks, open landscaped areas and common parts within the buildings. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will enable them collectively to upgrade their estates to a standard comparable to private residential estates. The residents will be able to enjoy the status and privileges of private residential owners without having to uproot themselves and move elsewhere. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the privatised estates will no longer come under HDB rules and regulations. They will be like any other private property, subject only to the Residential Property Act. Thus, for example, if the building is at least six storeys high, the flats can be sold to foreigners. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of this Bill does not imply automatic privatisation. This Bill is only an enabling legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB, as the landlord, will progressively identify which estates are ready for conversion. But it would then be up to the HUDC lessees themselves to obtain at least 75% support for the conversion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to set this 75% support requirement because the conversion process will entail costs to the lessees. It would thus be fair that a significant majority agree to bear these costs before the conversion can proceed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of legal transfer of title from HDB to HUDC lessees will take up to one and a half years as time is needed for the preparation of strata title survey plans and also the physical conversion works needed to bring the blocks up to the latest standard for the award of strata titles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to conversion costs. The lessees of HUDC Phase III or IV HUDC estates will have to pay for the conversion costs of around $25,000 each. This sum includes $20,000 for a carpark lot. The lessees should note that this upfront purchase of their car park lots, for which they can now use their CPF funds, will save them from having to pay parking charges over the rest of their lease. Other conversion costs include legal and survey fees, and also construction costs to meet prevailing barrier-free requirements of strata-titled properties. Lessees of HUDC Phases I and II flats will not need to incur the car park cost as they already have a share of the car parks and common areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the conversion, the residents can form management corporations to manage and maintain their estates. The management corporations can carry out improvements without having to seek HDB's consent. They can also build additional facilities, if they desire to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town councils will work out the portion of their sinking funds which are attributable to the HUDC estates and transfer the amount to the management corporations of the HUDC estates to be converted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a pilot project is needed to test the full complexity of the scheme and iron out any problems which may arise. We have thus chosen two Phase III HUDC estates - Pine Grove and Gillman Heights - for the pilot project. If successful, the Government will extend the conversion scheme to other HUDC estates batch by batch. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to include two other consequential amendments. One is a house-keeping amendment to the Land Titles (Strata) Act to enable the surrender and re-issue of State leases which would be consistent with the leases HDB has given to the lessees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment is to provide for the creation of a charge on the converted flats for which CPF funds had been used. Without this amendment, the lessees will have to go through the process of discharging their CPF debts and re-applying for new CPF mortgage for their strata-titled properties. It would also allow the owners to use CPF funds to pay for the costs, fees and other incidental expenses in the lodgement of the charge. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the passage of this Bill will allow for the conversion of HUDC flats to strata titles. It will allow the residents the freedom to upgrade their estates if they desire to enhance their assets further. It will be one step further towards meeting the aspirations of Singaporeans to own private property. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have HUDC flats in my constituency along Bedok Reservoir Road and they fall under Phases III and IV of the scheme. Based on feedback I have received directly from many of the residents, they are all in favour of privatisation, but many residents have asked me to seek the following clarifications from the Minister on the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first clarification is this. Following the announcement of the Bill, I think a certain sense of ambiguity has prevailed and this pertains to the interpretation of the Private Residential Property Act and the Housing and Development Act. Many of the residents are not sure whether in the interim, pending the announcement of privatisation, they are still subject to the Housing and Development Act. Perhaps the Minister will want to clarify this point. Also many residents have raised the following questions which I am not in a position to answer unless the Minister clarifies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have asked me, in the interim, pending privatisation of the estate, will they be allowed to sell their flats to foreigners? And if they are under HDB rules, certainly they are not allowed to. If they are under HDB rules, will they be allowed to apply for another HDB flat and not be bound by the 30-month debarment period, which HUDC lessees are subjected to under Phases I and II? Perhaps the Minister would like to clarify this point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clarification pertains to the valuation of the car park lots. The residents are of the view that Pine Grove HUDC flats are comparable to flats in districts 9, 10 and 11. And $20,000 per car park lot is probably well justified. For an HUDC estate in a remote area like Bedok Reservoir Road, they think that the cost of a car park lot should not be equivalent to the cost of a car park lot in Pine Grove HUDC estate. Perhaps the Minister would want to clarify and explain the basis for computing the $20,000 car park lot. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third clarification. Presently, HUDC flats in Bedok eservoir Road are actually immersed in an HDB estate. As a result, common facilities like car parks and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> children playgrounds are shared. If we were to privatise the HUDC estate, how do we demarcate and split the common facilities? I think the residents want to know about this. This feedback came from the RCs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question is that there are about 12 blocks of HUDC flats in Bedok Reservoir Road and many of the residents have asked me when will HDB privatise this estate. They want to know in advance so that they can plan whether to retain, upgrade or to sell their flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would the Minister provide answers to these clarifications? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, let me first thank Mr Chew Heng Ching for his support of the Bill and for raising the queries to give me the opportunity to clarify. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the amendment to the Bill does not mean an automatic conversion of all the estates. We will take them batch by batch and this requires the residents to get together and sign on a form to say that they are in support of the conversion. When we get 75% yes to that form, HDB will assist them in lodging that form with the Registrar of Titles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon that, there will be the issue of subsidiary strata titles. With the issue of subsidiary strata titles, that will define the legal conversion from HDB flats to strata title flats. So we will take that as the legal date of conversion. Anything before that date will be treated as sold under Housing and Development Act, Part IV. Anything after that date, they will be under the Land Titles (Strata) Act. So that legal conversion date is quite clear in the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Housing and Development Act, the residents are not allowed to sell their flats to foreigners. That is quite clear. Under the Housing and Development Act, they are also not allowed to apply for HDB flats until 30 months have lapsed after they have sold their first flat. This is a little bit anomalous. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me try and explain. Under the Housing and Development Act, all HDB flat owners can apply for another HDB flat provided they pay a levy or a premium on the second flat. In the HUDC Phases III and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> IV, we have not imposed this levy or premium for them to apply for a second flat. This was unsatisfactory. So when we looked at the conversion exercise, we felt that we should try and streamline the position. There were two options: one, we could put HUDC Phases III and IV on the same basis and impose a levy, in which case, we will have to set a new levy and a new premium. Alternatively, we could treat them like HUDC Phases I and II where they are not allowed to apply for another HDB flat until 30 months after they have disposed of their flat. In looking at the two options, we decided to go for the second option, ie, for purposes of applying for a second flat, we treat them in the same way as we treat HUDC Phases I and II. This means that they can only apply for a flat 30 months after they have disposed of their first flat. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the valuation of car park lots, this is done by the valuers. They look at many factors. One approach is to look at market comparables. The second approach is to take the stream of car park revenue and bring it to net present value. If we take the second approach because car park charges are the same for Pine Grove, Gillman or Bedok Reservoir Road, then the market value of the car park remains the same. The third approach is, of course, to look at replacement cost to determine the market value. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valuers have looked at these three values of the car parks. They estimate that around $20,000 is a fair market value of a car park lot. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered all his questions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> The third clarification pertains to the sharing of common facilities between the HUDC and HDB flats now. Following the privatisation, how do we split the common facilities? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question is: when will Bedok Reservoir HUDC flats be privatised? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I am very sorry. In the Member's case, it is a slightly peculiar configuration, because the HUDC flats in Bedok Reservoir Road are in two groups with few blocks of Executive flats in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> between. HDB has, in fact, submitted a development control plan to URA to allow for the conversion of the HUDC blocks into two separate estates. So it will not interfere with the future conversion into strata titles. The Executive flats will be excised out. There will be a footpath for the Executive flats to Bedok Reservoir Road. The Executive flats will not be affected. The HUDC estates in the Member's constituency will be treated as two separate groupings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards timing, let us take this step by step. There are many individual issues pertaining to each individual estate. Let us get through the pilot project over the next four months in Pine Grove and Gillman estates. Once we are au fait with all the complexities and they are settled, then we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will bring in the future batches one at a time. We will announce the next batch in the early part of next year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Sixteen Minutes to\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Five o'clock pm to a date to be fixed.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SPECIAL SCHOOLS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Education how many disabled children are waiting to enter the special schools and whether there is any plan to build more such schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special schools are run by voluntary welfare organizations (VWOs) and funded jointly by Ministry of Education (MOE) and the National Council of Social Service. They cater to children with different disabilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special schools admit children throughout the year although some schools restrict their intake to twice a year. There is currently a total enrolment of 2868 children. As at 1st June 1995, there were 343 vacant places available in the various special schools. The number of children being processed for admission was 279. Placement of children in special schools requires careful matching. Various factors have to be taken into consideration, such as, their specific disability, their functional age, preferred location of the schools, availability of suitable personnel and facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has approved funds for the development of a 400-capacity purpose-built school for the Movement of the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) to replace its Towner Gardens School which has a capacity of 285. Three other VWOs also have plans to replace their present schools with purpose-built facilities for children with disabilities. They are the Rainbow Centre, The Spastic Children's Association of Singapore and the Association for the Educationally Subnormal. When all these purpose-built schools are completed there will be an increase in capacity of around 700. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NEIGHBOURHOOD PARK</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. \n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for National Development when will the planned neighbourhood park fronting Block 217 Serangoon Ave 4 be built, when will it be completed and what are its features. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of the proposed neighbourhood park at Serangoon Avenue 4 is being reviewed.

At that Conference, Singapore also called for the early conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

We stressed the need for all nuclear powers, including France, to abide by the agreement reached at the NPT Review and Extension Conference to exercise the utmost restraint pending the conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LIST OF CINEMAS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peter Sung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Peter Sung</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he will provide a list of all cinemas in Singapore together with the number of seats and the year in which each of these cinemas started operation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cinemas currently licensed by the Public Entertainment Licensing Unit are listed in Appendix A (Cols. 1405 - 1410). \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1995/19950707/19950707-HA-0641405.htm\">Appendix A (Cols. 1405 - 1410)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LIST OF CINEMAS CLOSED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peter Sung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Mr Peter Sung</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he will provide a list of cinemas that have been closed during the last five years, the year of closure and the number of seats in each of these cinemas. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 9 cinemas which did not renew their Public Entertainment licences during the last five years are listed in Appendix B (Cols. 1411 - 1412). \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1995/19950707/19950707-HA-0641411.htm\">Appendix B (Cols. 1411 - 1412)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1401</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CYANIDE POISONING</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the investigation into the cyanide poisoning of National University of Singapore (NUS) lecturers has been completed and whether the NUS has conducted its own investigation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police investigations which have been completed showed that it was not an accidental case.
