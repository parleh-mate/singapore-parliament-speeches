You are,\r\n\r\nSir,  the fourth to be elected to this high  office\r\n\r\nsince  the introduction of parliamentary government\r\n\r\nin   Singapore.  Your  appointment,  moreover,  has\r\n\r\nbroken what could, inadvertently, have crystallised\r\n\r\ninto  a  convention - that the robe of the  Speaker\r\n\r\nshould fall on the shoulders of those with a  legal\r\n\r\ntraining.  The  three previous  Speakers  were  all\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the legal profession.  This  could  be\r\n\r\nattributed   to   the  judicial  atmosphere   which\r\n\r\nenvelopes this particular office. A great  deal  of\r\n\r\nthe  ritual  associated  with  the  Speaker  has  a\r\n\r\njudicial  flavour.  Even functionally  there  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat deal of similarity between the Judge and  the\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  The  impartiality both  are  expected  to\r\n\r\nmaintain   between   contending   and   contentious\r\n\r\nfactions  has  to  be,  it is  generally  believed,\r\n\r\njudicial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these may have been among the reasons for\r\n\r\nthe  choice of Speakers from members of  the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession.  Therefore, in electing a distinguished\r\n\r\nsurgeon,  whose professional regalia is  the  white\r\n\r\nrobe  and cap, the House has, quite rightly, denied\r\n\r\nthat  impartiality, even if it has to be  judicial,\r\n\r\nis  necessarily a monopoly of members of the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me add that in electing you to this\r\n\r\nresponsible  position, the  House  was  not  swayed\r\n\r\nwholly    by    your   professional   achievements,\r\n\r\nconsiderable though they are. It is also  based  on\r\n\r\nthe  high  regard we have for your sense of  social\r\n\r\nresponsibility; for your belief that  in  this  day\r\n\r\nand  age  it is not enough for a citizen to confine\r\n\r\nhis  interests  and responsibility  to  the  narrow\r\n\r\nfield  of his profession. We are all aware that  in\r\n\r\nmany  developing  countries  professional  men  are\r\n\r\npaying  a  heavy  price because of their  steadfast\r\n\r\nreluctance     to     undertake     the     broader\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of  citizenship.   As   societies\r\n\r\nbecome  more  unstable and chaotic,  not  only  are\r\n\r\nprofessional standards lowered but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven  the  dignified practice of  many  professions\r\n\r\nbecomes more and more difficult to maintain. So the\r\n\r\nincreasing number of professional men who  find  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to pack their bags and wander about  the\r\n\r\nface  of the earth in search of new pastures.  They\r\n\r\ncould have averted this tragedy had they manifested\r\n\r\nan  active  concern for the wider problems  of  the\r\n\r\nsocieties  in  which  they lived.  They  and  their\r\n\r\nchildren need not have, as many of them are  today,\r\n\r\nbecome mendicants hawking their professional skills\r\n\r\nto such countries which would care to buy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, Sir, are a professional man acutely aware of\r\n\r\nthe  wider responsibilities which professional  men\r\n\r\nshould shoulder to ensure their status and dignity.\r\n\r\nYou have, despite the heavy demands made on you  by\r\n\r\nyour professional responsibilities, shouldered  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of citizenship as well. You  stood\r\n\r\nfor  election  twice in your present  constituency.\r\n\r\nYou  have, as the Deputy Speaker of this House,  as\r\n\r\nthe    Chairman   of   the   Detainees    Aftercare\r\n\r\nAssociation, as a Justice of the Peace, and as  the\r\n\r\nChairman   of  the  University  Council,  concerned\r\n\r\nyourself with many public affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are among the many reasons which prompted\r\n\r\nthis  House  to  elect  you  as  Speaker.  We   are\r\n\r\nconfident that, with this wide range of experience,\r\n\r\nyou  will be able to discharge ably and judiciously\r\n\r\nthe  new and heavy responsibilities that have  been\r\n\r\nentrusted to you. You can be assured, Sir, that for\r\n\r\nour part we will give all the cooperation necessary\r\n\r\nto  lighten  the burdens of your office.  In  some\r\n\r\nParliaments  the  Speaker  is  exposed  to  hazards\r\n\r\nranging  from moral intimidation to mortal  injury.\r\n\r\nBut the Parliament of Singapore, I am happy to say,\r\n\r\nhas,   even   where   it  has   occasionally   been\r\n\r\nboisterous,  maintained  a decorous  purposefulness\r\n\r\nwhich,  I  am  sure,  Sir,  you  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nmaintain. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to welcome you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  your  office. On this occasion it seems  to  me\r\n\r\nappropriate  to  remind  this  Parliament  and  the\r\n\r\nnation  that  the  office of Speaker  occupies  the\r\n\r\nhighest  pinnacle of prestige in the  structure  of\r\n\r\nour system of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your office, Mr Speaker, Sir, embodies the\r\n\r\ndignity  of  a  country's representative  assembly.\r\n\r\nMuch of your work will be formal and ceremonial  in\r\n\r\ncharacter, but behind all these rituals  and  forms\r\n\r\nof   things   lies  a  very  grave  and   important\r\n\r\nresponsibility of presiding over the debates of our\r\n\r\nParliament, safeguarding its privileges, and acting\r\n\r\nas its representative. Mr Speaker, Sir, the nature\r\n\r\nof your office is judicial. Perhaps it was for this\r\n\r\nreason that the office of Speaker in Singapore  had\r\n\r\nbeen  previously occupied by eminent men  from  the\r\n\r\nlegal profession. In the early days of our history,\r\n\r\nwhen  parliamentary institutions were in the  stage\r\n\r\nof  transplanted infancy, the selection of men with\r\n\r\nlegal  training was, in retrospect, both  wise  and\r\n\r\nnecessary.  The letter and spirit of  parliamentary\r\n\r\nrule required careful nurturing, and men with legal\r\n\r\nqualifications were the best possible and available\r\n\r\ncandidates  for  the  office of  the  Speaker.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   legal  qualifications   are   not\r\n\r\nessential for the proper discharge of the duties of\r\n\r\nthe   Speaker.   Indeed   the   technicalities   of\r\n\r\nparliamentary procedure, I believe, can be  learned\r\n\r\nfrom  textbooks. The experience of  countries  with\r\n\r\nlong  traditions  of parliamentary  government  has\r\n\r\nshown  that  there  is absolutely  no  evidence  to\r\n\r\npresume  that  only a lawyer can make a  successful\r\n\r\nSpeaker. What is more essential, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis parliamentary rather than legal experience. This\r\n\r\nexperience,  Sir,  you have  acquired  first  as  a\r\n\r\nMember of Parliament, and then as Deputy Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By being the first non-legal man to be elected\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  you, Sir, have made history in Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs  in  all walks of life, some Speakers are better\r\n\r\nthan  others.  But  whoever assumes  the  Speaker's\r\n\r\nmantle  inherits the dignity and the responsibility\r\n\r\nthat go with the office. In breaking precedent with\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npast, we in this Parliament firmly believe that you\r\n\r\nwill   guide  its  proceedings  with  dignity   and\r\n\r\nimpartiality,  and  with credit  to  your  surgical\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, superficially, one may not see\r\n\r\nthe relevance of some ingredients of success in the\r\n\r\nsurgical  profession  to the  qualities  which  are\r\n\r\ndeemed to be necessary for the successful discharge\r\n\r\nof  the duties of the Speaker. If one examines  the\r\n\r\nspecialised  competence that distinguishes  surgery\r\n\r\nfrom other professions and occupations, one may  be\r\n\r\ninclined  towards this view. Yet  there  are  other\r\n\r\nqualities  in  the  career of a successful  surgeon\r\n\r\nthat are relevant in the discharge of the duties of\r\n\r\nthe  Speakership.  These  are,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nintegrity, judgment, common sense, patience,  tact,\r\n\r\na  sense  of  humour, self-confidence, presence  of\r\n\r\nmind,  and  firmness  tempered  with  courtesy  and\r\n\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the dignity of your office\r\n\r\nyou will be rewarded by the strain of long hours in\r\n\r\nthe Chair. You have exchanged the right to generate\r\n\r\nheat and passion for the obligation to sit with  an\r\n\r\nunruffled demeanour through more speeches than  any\r\n\r\nother  of my Parliamentary colleagues will probably\r\n\r\nwish  to  hear. You sit as the Judge, and  will  be\r\n\r\nexercising  your judgment all the  time.  You  have\r\n\r\nbeen  with  us  long  enough to  have  acquired  an\r\n\r\nintimate  understanding of parliamentary  life  the\r\n\r\nindividual and collective problems of the  Members,\r\n\r\nand their strengths and weaknesses. For this reason\r\n\r\nwe  are confident that you will not allow an  over-technical  interpretation of the rules of procedure\r\n\r\nto  restrict debate, and when a situation calls for\r\n\r\ninterruption  you will give a stern  rebuke  if  it\r\n\r\nmerits  sternness,  or supply a  touch  of  humour,\r\n\r\nwhich  can dissolve a strained situation in a burst\r\n\r\nof laughter, provided, of course, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  laughter is that of human beings and not  that\r\n\r\nof gibbons. It is the nature of the office that the\r\n\r\nSpeaker seldom speaks, but when he does he speaks\r\n\r\nwith authority, and this authority comes from  his\r\n\r\nimpartiality  and its acceptance  by  the  Members.\r\n\r\nWhen you speak, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  will  be the voice of authority, for  you  have\r\n\r\ndemonstrated   your   impartiality   during    your\r\n\r\napprenticeship   as   Deputy  Speaker,   and   this\r\n\r\nParliament   has   indicated  acceptance   in   the\r\n\r\nunanimity of its support of your candidature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe I have the\r\n\r\nendorsement of my Parliamentary colleagues  when  I\r\n\r\nsay that we will do our best to make your work less\r\n\r\ntedious  and  more pleasant by working  within  the\r\n\r\nframework  of the best of parliamentary traditions,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  to give and take with firmness but  with\r\n\r\ncourtesy.  It  was once said with  reference  to  a\r\n\r\nSpeaker  in  the  British Parliament  that,  and  I\r\n\r\nquote,  Sir, \"The office of Speaker does not demand\r\n\r\nrare  qualities, it demands common qualities  in  a\r\n\r\nrare  degree.\"  And  with this, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\npermit me to congratulate you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to congratulate you on\r\n\r\nthe  occasion  of  your  election  as  Speaker   of\r\n\r\nParliament.

I\r\n\r\nbelieve  many know you now as a surgeon  of  repute\r\n\r\nand  skill. But it is interesting to note that  you\r\n\r\nfirst obtained your Bachelor of Arts (Honours)  and\r\n\r\nMaster  of  Arts  degrees at London  and  Cambridge\r\n\r\nUniversities  before  obtaining  your  Bachelor  of\r\n\r\nMedicine   and  Bachelor  of  Surgery   degree   at\r\n\r\nCambridge  University. I understand that  you  were\r\n\r\nalso  no mean sportsman, having excelled in cricket\r\n\r\nand tennis during your student days and represented\r\n\r\nyour  university in badminton. If I  may  say,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  you  are  a forerunner  of  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nindividual we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naim  to  build up among our young citizens,  always\r\n\r\nexcelling in all pursuits and endeavours.

We  are\r\n\r\ngrateful that in recent years you have devoted your\r\n\r\ntime  and  skill  to  the  training  of  our  local\r\n\r\nsurgeons.

The main objective underlying the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was  to  control  the  establishment  of\r\n\r\ncertain   manufacturing   industries   which   were\r\n\r\nconsidered   essential  operations,  and   it   was\r\n\r\nnecessary then to limit them because of the limited\r\n\r\ndomestic  markets  and of other  economic  factors.\r\n\r\nUntil 1967, this Ordinance was not much used. Since\r\n\r\nthen, industrialisation has gained momentum and  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary now to implement this Ordinance  more\r\n\r\nstringently. However, many aspects of the Ordinance\r\n\r\nare ineffective. The proposed amendment, therefore,\r\n\r\naims  at  tightening the legislation. To this  end,\r\n\r\nthe   Ordinance  may  be  used  as   an   important\r\n\r\ninstrument    in   controlling   and    channelling\r\n\r\ninvestments  into industries which are economically\r\n\r\nbeneficial to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a provision under section 5 (2) (a) and\r\n\r\n(b)  of  the Ordinance which provides for automatic\r\n\r\nregistration  of  companies  which  have  been   in\r\n\r\nproduction  or  have  bona  fide  made  substantial\r\n\r\npreparations prior to the gazetting of a particular\r\n\r\nproduct under the Schedule to the Ordinance. It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to impose some pressure on such companies\r\n\r\nwhich  might  otherwise  be  lax  in  applying  for\r\n\r\nregistration.  To this end, the amendment  to  this\r\n\r\nsection  provides  the condition that  registration\r\n\r\nshould  be  effective within  six  months  of  such\r\n\r\nspecification  of goods published in  the  Gazette.\r\n\r\nThereafter,  all  applications  shall  be   treated\r\n\r\nafresh.  Those  who fail to apply for  registration\r\n\r\nwithin the six months' period shall be guilty of an\r\n\r\noffence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding $10,000, and to a fine not exceeding\r\n\r\n$1,000  for  every  day during  which  the  offence\r\n\r\ncontinues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsections (3), (4) and (5) of section 5 should\r\n\r\nbe deleted, as there is no reason why the Registrar\r\n\r\nshould  not undertake further application within  a\r\n\r\ncertain period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the revocation of certificates referred\r\n\r\nto  in  section  6 of the Ordinance, the  amendment\r\n\r\nempowers  the  Registrar to revoke the  certificate\r\n\r\nwhere   it   has  been  proved  that  a  registered\r\n\r\nmanufacturer has ceased production for a continuous\r\n\r\nperiod   of   three  months.  To  complement   this\r\n\r\nparticular action, the Registrar may also determine\r\n\r\nthe  minimum quantity of goods to be produced by  a\r\n\r\nregistered manufacturer. This additional  power  is\r\n\r\nprovided for in the additional subsection (5).  The\r\n\r\namendment, in effect, incorporates a more  specific\r\n\r\nand wider scope in the conditions for revocation of\r\n\r\nthe certificate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a measure for implementing the Ordinance more\r\n\r\neffectively,  the  amendment to section  8  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance has been introduced so as to increase the\r\n\r\npenalty for offences committed under the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Ordinance. For those who  have  failed  to\r\n\r\nregister in respect of a particular item of  goods,\r\n\r\nthe  fine  has  been  increased  from  $10,000   to\r\n\r\n$50,000.  The penalty for those who have failed  to\r\n\r\ncomply with any condition for registration has been\r\n\r\nincreased   from   $5,000  to  $10,000;   and   for\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  who  have contrived  to  give  false\r\n\r\ninformation  to  render the Ordinance  ineffective,\r\n\r\nthe  fine  for  such an offence has been  increased\r\n\r\nfrom  $500  to  $1,000.  In  this  connection,   an\r\n\r\nadditional  subsection (5)  has  been  added  which\r\n\r\nallows the Registrar to compound offences under the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, instead of imposing fines by  the  court\r\n\r\nupon conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the main purpose of the Ordinance aims at\r\n\r\nprotecting   the   interests   of   some   of   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  who are required to  register  under\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance, some form of an annual fee should be\r\n\r\nimposed. To this end a new section 11 (1)  and  (2)\r\n\r\nhas been added to the Ordinance, which empowers the\r\n\r\nMinister to impose an annual duty according to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  schedule drawn up on the basis of fixed  capital\r\n\r\ninvestment.

Under the law as\r\n\r\nit  stands,  such retirements can only be  effected\r\n\r\nunder the provision relating to retirements in  the\r\n\r\npublic  interest. This is not satisfactory because,\r\n\r\nthrough  usage over the years, there  is  a  stigma\r\n\r\nattached to retirements in the public interest.  To\r\n\r\nretire officers under this clause simply because of\r\n\r\nthe  absence of a more appropriate one, results  in\r\n\r\ncasting  an  unfair slur on the officers concerned.\r\n\r\nThe amendment under consideration is to rectify the\r\n\r\nsituation  by  providing for premature  retirements\r\n\r\nthat are not made on disciplinary grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Pensions Ordinance\r\n\r\nto allow an officer who has completed not less than\r\n\r\n15  years  of  service to be retired.

One estimate of tourist arrivals\r\n\r\nin  1972  puts the number at 680,000 compared  with\r\n\r\nabout 360,000 in 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hong Kong last year, there were 6,400 hotel\r\n\r\nrooms  catering for some 600,000 tourist  arrivals.\r\n\r\nAllowing  for some degree of under-supply of  hotel\r\n\r\nrooms  in  Hong Kong, these figures show  that  the\r\n\r\nhotel  room  supply in Singapore  will  be  far  in\r\n\r\nexcess  of  demand unless a special effort  is  now\r\n\r\nmounted  to  attract more tourists to the  Republic\r\n\r\nand to lengthen their stay here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board is in the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  stepping  up  its  overseas  promotion\r\n\r\nactivities,  particularly in Japan, Australia,  the\r\n\r\nUnited States of America and Germany. The Board has\r\n\r\nengaged full-time representatives in Sydney and San\r\n\r\nFrancisco to handle promotion work in Australia and\r\n\r\nthe United States of America. In Tokyo a very well-known Japanese firm has been appointed by the Board\r\n\r\nas our advertising and public relations agency. The\r\n\r\nTourist  Promotion  Board  is  at  present  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  establishing  another  representative,\r\n\r\nthis time in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also developing new facilities\r\n\r\nand improving existing ones to give tourists a more\r\n\r\ninteresting  time. A large aviary is  fast  nearing\r\n\r\ncompletion in the Jurong industrial estate. It will\r\n\r\nbe  one of the finest in the world. The high-lights\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  flight cage covering an area  of  five\r\n\r\nacres  and  a 100-foot man-made waterfall.  To  the\r\n\r\nbest  of  my  knowledge, these are the  largest  of\r\n\r\ntheir  kind  in  the world. A no  less  spectacular\r\n\r\nmarine-land is being designed and planned  for  the\r\n\r\nBedok reclamation area, whilst a first-class zoo or\r\n\r\na zoological garden is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproposed  to  be  established in  the  vicinity  of\r\n\r\nSeletar Reservoir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most concentrated development of\r\n\r\ntourist facilities in Singapore will eventually  be\r\n\r\nlocated in the island now named Blakang Mati.  Here\r\n\r\nwe  have engaged at some cost a well-known American\r\n\r\ncorporation   with   great   experience   in    the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of tourist facilities. It will  review\r\n\r\nthe  development plans that we have made for this\r\n\r\nisland. Their final recommendations and plans  will\r\n\r\nbe submitted to the Government in six months' time.\r\n\r\nSubsequent development of Blakang Mati  will  be  a\r\n\r\njoint effort between the Government and the private\r\n\r\nsector,     with    Government    providing     the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  facilities, such as jetties,  roads\r\n\r\nand utility services, and certain basic attractions\r\n\r\nsuch   as  an  18-hole  championship  golf  course,\r\n\r\nmuseums, art and craft centres, marinas and  so  on\r\n\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These plans to bring more tourists to Singapore\r\n\r\nand  to  lengthen their stay are, needless to  say,\r\n\r\nvery   costly.  Not  all  of  them  can  be   self-supporting. In addition to the money spent  on  the\r\n\r\naviary,  zoo, marineland and on projects at Blakang\r\n\r\nMati,  the  Tourist  Promotion Board's  budget  for\r\n\r\noverseas promotion and advertising also has  to  be\r\n\r\nincreased  in the coming fiscal year.  It  will  be\r\n\r\nincreased to $1.3 million from the previous rate of\r\n\r\n$400,000.  This  increased sum, however,  is  still\r\n\r\nsmall compared, for instance, to what Hong Kong  is\r\n\r\nspending on overseas promotion and advertisement - no less than $2.1 million by the Government alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Republic's hotels and restaurants benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  Government's efforts, it is, therefore,  only\r\n\r\nequitable   that   they   should   make   a   small\r\n\r\ncontribution. Hotels are already doing  so  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  a  three  per cent cess  on  hotel  room\r\n\r\nrentals.   It   is  proposed  to  make  first-class\r\n\r\nrestaurants  and bars do likewise. These  would  be\r\n\r\nbars  which  hold any of the following licences:  a\r\n\r\npublic house first-class (extended) (tourist hotel)\r\n\r\nlicence,  or a public house first-class  (extended)\r\n\r\nlicence, or a public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouse   first-class   licence.  Restaurants   which\r\n\r\nqualify  are those operating a bar service  holding\r\n\r\nany  of  the aforementioned licences. All bars  and\r\n\r\nrestaurants in gazetted tourist hotels are also  to\r\n\r\nbe included in this scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, there are more than 360 of such\r\n\r\nestablishments.  An  amendment   to   the   Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board Ordinance seeks to impose  a  three\r\n\r\nper  cent tax on the sale of each item of  food  or\r\n\r\ndrink in selected bars and restaurants. Their names\r\n\r\nwill  be gazetted shortly and they will be required\r\n\r\nto pay the stipulated tax as from 1st of March this\r\n\r\nyear  to the Comptroller of Customs and Excise  who\r\n\r\nwill be appointed by the Tourist Promotion Board to\r\n\r\ncollect such tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this amendment, the Bill\r\n\r\nintroduces three others. The first seeks to  change\r\n\r\nthe  method  of appointing members to  the  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board. Whereas existing legislation  provides specifically for some members of the Board to\r\n\r\nbe drawn from a particular body or institution, the\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment does not set such a limitation.\r\n\r\nThe  other  two amendments are minor in  character.\r\n\r\nThey  seek to change the commencement date  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year from 1st January to 1st April and to\r\n\r\nbring   the  provision  regarding  the  laying   of\r\n\r\nregulations  before  Parliament  into   line   with\r\n\r\ncurrent practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all know, the promotion\r\n\r\nof   tourism   is   a  very  important   means   of\r\n\r\nstrengthening our economy. The Minister  said  just\r\n\r\nnow  that we must take measures to do so.  He  said\r\n\r\nthe  number of hotel rooms in Singapore is becoming\r\n\r\ntoo excessive for our requirements, and unless more\r\n\r\ntourists are attracted to Singapore, tourism as  an\r\n\r\nindustry will not be as revenue-producing  as  that\r\n\r\nin  Hong Kong. The proposed measures to remedy  the\r\n\r\nsituation are very wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not an expert on tourism, but I feel that\r\n\r\nthere  are  certain aspects of tourist  development\r\n\r\nwhich are not comprehensible. For instance, has the\r\n\r\nTourist Promotion Board any experienced guides  who\r\n\r\ncan  inform  the  tourists  about  the  history  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?  According  to my knowledge,  the  Board\r\n\r\ndoes not seem to have done this in the past. I feel\r\n\r\nthat  it should pay more attention to these aspects\r\n\r\nof  tourist  development  in  future.  The  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board should employ tourist  guides  who\r\n\r\nare  more conversant with our history. They  should\r\n\r\nbe  genuine guides for tourists. People of  dubious\r\n\r\ncharacter  should  not be encouraged  to  serve  as\r\n\r\ntourist  guides. Only in this way will tourists  be\r\n\r\nable  to  know  that  we  are  progressing.  But  I\r\n\r\nunderstand some tourist guides are employed by  the\r\n\r\nTourist Promotion Board on a temporary basis. These\r\n\r\nguides take tourists to places which do not reflect\r\n\r\nwell on Singapore. For instance, they take tourists\r\n\r\nto  the  death house where old and sick people  are\r\n\r\nwaiting  for  their death. Naturally  the  tourists\r\n\r\nwill report unfavourably on Singapore. This is  the\r\n\r\nkind of thing that should not be stressed too much.\r\n\r\nSome  guides even tell the tourists that the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore are backward. I think this is not good\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  and  I hope the  Tourist  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard will take action to remedy this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister said that since 1967 we\r\n\r\nhave built more and more hotel rooms and there  are\r\n\r\nnow  a  good number of first-class hotels.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat the charges of these hotels are very high  and\r\n\r\nare  even more expensive than those charged by  the\r\n\r\nfirst-class hotels in Hong Kong. For instance,  for\r\n\r\na  single  room the charge here is $56, whereas  in\r\n\r\nHong  Kong it is from $30 to $40. Some hotels  here\r\n\r\ncharge  as  much  as $100 for a  room.  This  is  a\r\n\r\ndiscouraging factor for tourists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I feel that developers of hotels and\r\n\r\npeople in the tourist trade have a wrong conception\r\n\r\nof  certain  matters. They think that tourists  are\r\n\r\nall westernised people and that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant  a  certain kind of recreation. Hence we  have\r\n\r\nstrip-tease  dances  in our nightclubs.  We  should\r\n\r\nknow  that tourists might have seen even more naked\r\n\r\ndances  in Europe and elsewhere. So if we  want  to\r\n\r\nattract tourists by these methods, I must say  that\r\n\r\nthey are all wrong. On the other hand, it will only\r\n\r\ncreate  a bad impression on others. Such places  as\r\n\r\nnight-clubs, bars, and restaurants are visited  not\r\n\r\nonly  by tourists but also by the local people.  We\r\n\r\ncan  say  that three-quarters of the customers  are\r\n\r\nour  youths  and  some older folks. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nintention to attract foreign exchange by tourism is\r\n\r\ndefeated. Instead, it will create a bad environment\r\n\r\nfor  our people. What we should do is to create our\r\n\r\nown  unique  tradition and try to impress  our  own\r\n\r\ncultures  on  the  tourists  to  enable   them   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  us better. The traditional cultures  of\r\n\r\nour    various   races   have   their   own    good\r\n\r\ncharacteristics  and are unique in  themselves.  We\r\n\r\nshould  avail  ourselves of  every  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nmanifest  them fully especially to the tourists  in\r\n\r\norder to convey a good impression to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Minister for Finance said that we\r\n\r\nwill try our best to promote tourism and to do more\r\n\r\npublicity  work abroad to attract more tourists  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Of course, it is necessary  to  set  up\r\n\r\nvarious tourist spots and attractions in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThese  will  also provide interest  for  our  local\r\n\r\npeople  who might otherwise go to unsavoury  places\r\n\r\nto  pass  their  time. The Minister said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has recruited experts from  America  to\r\n\r\nadvise  it on how to develop tourism and to set  up\r\n\r\nvarious  tourist  spots. I think these  people  who\r\n\r\ncome here to advise us on matters of tourism have a\r\n\r\ndifferent background and different views on how  to\r\n\r\npromote  tourism.  In Singapore, we  should  create\r\n\r\nsomething  that is unique and that can reflect  our\r\n\r\nown  culture. We should not ape others. I  feel  we\r\n\r\nhave  many  people  in  Singapore,  especially  the\r\n\r\nartistes,  who can help the Government  to  reflect\r\n\r\nlocal conditions,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.09       p.m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all let me avail myself\r\n\r\nof  this  opportunity to congratulate  the  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board on its success and achievements  in\r\n\r\npromoting   tourism.  The  main  purpose   of   the\r\n\r\namendment Bill is to enable the Board to collect  a\r\n\r\nthree  per cent cess on all sales of food and drink\r\n\r\nfrom tourist food establishments and tourist public\r\n\r\nhouses  in order to use such cess to subsidise  our\r\n\r\npublicity  promotion  efforts.  This  is   a   very\r\n\r\npractical  method. We know that the Government  has\r\n\r\nalready  spent  large  sums  of  money  on  tourist\r\n\r\npromotion and that it has set up offices in various\r\n\r\nparts  of the world to publicise Singapore in order\r\n\r\nto  attract more tourists to come here and in order\r\n\r\nto  earn a large amount of foreign exchange for the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  our  economy.  As  a  result  of   the\r\n\r\nstrenuous  efforts  of the Government   to  set  up\r\n\r\nvarious tourist attractions, our tourist trade  has\r\n\r\nimproved  greatly today. It has earned praise  from\r\n\r\nall  quarters. Since the promotion of tourism  will\r\n\r\ninvolve  Government  in  expending  large  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney,  it  has every reason to impose a  cess  on\r\n\r\ntourist   hotels   and   food   establishments   to\r\n\r\nsupplement its expenditure. By this means, it  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  do more publicity and  attract  more\r\n\r\ntourists  to Singapore. This will also bring  about\r\n\r\nmore job opportunities for our people. As a result,\r\n\r\nwe  will improve our economy. This measure is  most\r\n\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I want to know who will have\r\n\r\nto  pay the three per cent cess. If proprietors of\r\n\r\nhotels  and food establishments are asked  to  pay,\r\n\r\nthen  they will pass the three per cent cess on  to\r\n\r\ntheir customers. Therefore, the customers will have\r\n\r\nto  bear the additional charges and the proprietors\r\n\r\nand  owners of these establishments will not  have\r\n\r\nto  pay  the cess. I feel there should be  certain\r\n\r\nregulations to ensure that the new tariff does  not\r\n\r\nfall on the shoulders of the tourists. I understand\r\n\r\nthere have been a number of complaints against  the\r\n\r\nhigh charges made by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhotels,  just  as what the Member for  Delta  has\r\n\r\ndescribed.   If  we  impose  on  the  tourists this\r\n\r\nadditional  cess,  it  would  definitely  have   an\r\n\r\nunfavourable   reaction  on  the   tourist   trade.\r\n\r\nSecondly, what yardstick would the Minister use  in\r\n\r\nclassifying  hotels  as  tourist-class  or  first-.\r\n\r\nclass? Thirdly, when can we see the, completion of\r\n\r\nthe  Bali  project  and how much  money  will  be\r\n\r\ninvolved? Fourthly, at the moment we are short  of\r\n\r\ngood  cooks. We have to recruit cooks, mainly  from\r\n\r\nHong  Kong and elsewhere, because of the increase\r\n\r\nin  hotels. This will not only incur a loss in  our\r\n\r\nforeign, exchange, but will also deprive our people\r\n\r\nof  jobs. So I wonder whether the Tourist Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  can  set up some kind of training school  to\r\n\r\ntrain cooks for local employment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> There has been considerable debate in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  in  the  press, among trade  and  financial\r\n\r\ncircles, over the ways and means of developing the\r\n\r\ntourist  industry. Everyone agrees  that  something\r\n\r\nhas to be done, but nobody has thought of what  has\r\n\r\nto be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has just told this House that to woo\r\n\r\ntourists  from  abroad,  money  must  be  spent  on\r\n\r\npublicising  Singapore. Experience has  shown  that\r\n\r\nthe amount of money needed to increase the flow of\r\n\r\ntourists    cannot   be   obtained   by   voluntary\r\n\r\ncontributions from the industry. It  is  with  this\r\n\r\nview  in  mind that I support the Bill to  levy  a\r\n\r\ncess  on  or through the industry which  stands  to\r\n\r\ngain  from  the  efforts of the  Tourist  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In going through this Bill, I notice that no\r\n\r\nintention  is stated or indicated as to  who  would\r\n\r\nhave to pay the cess in the first instance. Is  the\r\n\r\ncess  to be collected as a sort of turnover tax  on\r\n\r\nlodging,  food  and  drinks,  or  is  it  to  be\r\n\r\nadditional to the bill to be presented to the guest\r\n\r\nor customer? I cannot agree with my colleague that\r\n\r\nthe cess should be borne by the industry. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  prefer  to have the cess as an addition,  to\r\n\r\nthe  bill. The three per cent cess levy is  not  a\r\n\r\nheavy  one  and is unlikely to cause any resentment\r\n\r\nto  tourists or the local consumers of  food  and\r\n\r\ndrinks in certain more costly places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the Government levy in Japan is ten\r\n\r\nper  cent and in Taiwan thirteen per cent.  Hotel\r\n\r\noperators and restaurateurs will most likely pass\r\n\r\non  the levy through increased prices, if they  are\r\n\r\nasked to pay a levy on the gross salary and, in so\r\n\r\ndoing,  they  are  more often  likely  to  increase\r\n\r\nprices by more than the levy. What can be worse is\r\n\r\nthat  not  only are the prices increased,  but  the\r\n\r\nvolume  of  sales is reduced to a lower figure  in\r\n\r\norder to defraud on payment of the cess as well as\r\n\r\nincome tax. This is less likely to happen and there\r\n\r\nis less incentive to do so if the levy is initially\r\n\r\nand  directly  paid  by the guest  or  customer.  I\r\n\r\nforesee that the rate of levy will be going up  and\r\n\r\nnot  coming down in the future. Other countries have\r\n\r\na  much higher rate than this Bill seeks to impose.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister has the power to vary the levy at any\r\n\r\ntime,  and I frankly do not anticipate him lowering\r\n\r\nthe  rate.  The  higher  he varies  the  rate,  the\r\n\r\ngreater will be the incentives to defraud.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   better  to  start   the   cess   under\r\n\r\nconditions   where  there  is  less  incentive   to\r\n\r\ndefraud. Having said this, it only remains  for  me\r\n\r\nto  add that it should be decided that the cess  be\r\n\r\npaid  directly by the customer who partakes of  the\r\n\r\nfood  and drinks in the same way as the hotel guest\r\n\r\nis  now paying for his room. Therefore, either  the\r\n\r\nschedule  is  amended  or the Minister,  under  the\r\n\r\npowers   conferred  upon  him  under  section   11,\r\n\r\nspecifies a minimum cess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person can go to a first-class hotel and have a\r\n\r\ncup of coffee which may cost a dollar. If he goes\r\n\r\nalone,  which is unlikely, he has to pay a cess  of\r\n\r\nthree cents. If he takes two friends along, he  has\r\n\r\nto pay nine cents. This will be awkward. I suggest,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  a  minimum  cess  of  five  cents   and\r\n\r\nthereafter to the nearest five cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.27 p.m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am much obliged to Members\r\n\r\nfor putting forward various useful suggestions. The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Delta  has  brought  up  a  number  of\r\n\r\nrelevant points which I propose to reply to in some\r\n\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as regards tourist guides. At present,\r\n\r\nthey  have  to be licensed by the Tourist Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard.  They  are carefully selected,  trained  and\r\n\r\nexamined.  The examination papers include questions\r\n\r\non   the   history  of  Singapore.  In  fact,   the\r\n\r\nexaminations  are quite stiff and I  doubt  whether\r\n\r\nany  Member  will  relish  going  through  such   a\r\n\r\nstringent course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards death-houses, which happen to be in my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  it is very difficult  to  put  these\r\n\r\ninstitutions out of bounds to people  who  want  to\r\n\r\nsee  them. I do not think it is practical to  debar\r\n\r\nforeign  visitors from having a look  at  them.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  I am told that some enterprising members  of\r\n\r\nmy  constituency  are  selling  little  coffins  as\r\n\r\nsouvenirs to tourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also says that hotel charges are too\r\n\r\nhigh compared to Hong Kong. I do not know what  the\r\n\r\nfacts  are, but I would agree with her that at  one\r\n\r\ntime  hotel  charges in Singapore were  very  high.\r\n\r\nThat  was  because there was an acute  shortage  of\r\n\r\nrooms  and  the hotels decided to charge  what  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  could bear. The Government  wrote  to  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of the trade who were represented  by  the\r\n\r\nHotel   and   Restaurant   Association,   or   some\r\n\r\nassociation by this name, and asked them  how  they\r\n\r\nwould  respond  to government controls.  They  said\r\n\r\n\"No\".  They  objected  to government  controls  and\r\n\r\nthought  that  this should be left  to  the  market\r\n\r\nforces  of supply and demand. I am holding them  to\r\n\r\nthis  answer,  because in the years to  come,  when\r\n\r\nthere  is an excess of hotel rooms, I hope we  will\r\n\r\nnot  hear complaints about hotel charges being  too\r\n\r\nhigh,  but cut-throat competition forcing them  too\r\n\r\nlow. So I think the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblem of high hotel charges will solve itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards entertainment in hotels as a tourist\r\n\r\nattraction, the Member complained about the  rather\r\n\r\nlow   standard   of  strip-tease  performances   in\r\n\r\nSingapore   which  do  not  come  up   to   foreign\r\n\r\nstandards.  I  agree with her, but I  am  not  sure\r\n\r\nwhether  she is in favour of improving our standard\r\n\r\nto that in Soho or San Francisco. Of course, she is\r\n\r\nright  that  the  patrons of these shows,  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  who go to bars, are not tourists but mostly\r\n\r\nlocal  residents. However, if they  want  to  spend\r\n\r\ntheir  money  this way, we cannot  stop  them.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment is not a religious organisation.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot a moral institution. Possibly the only thing we\r\n\r\ncould  do is to increase the entertainment  tax  on\r\n\r\nthis  kind of performances. Anyway, I do not  think\r\n\r\nany special measure is called for in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member, however, has made a very valuable\r\n\r\ncontribution in saying that we should not encourage\r\n\r\nthis  foreign type of entertainment,  but  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  develop  our  own special  characteristics.\r\n\r\nActually, the Tourist Promotion Board is forming  a\r\n\r\ncompany, in conjunction with private enterprise, to\r\n\r\nstage  cultural  performances for  the  benefit  of\r\n\r\ntourists at a small charge. If all goes well,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be performed in West Point Garden in about  a\r\n\r\nmonth  or two from now. Then it will depend on  how\r\n\r\nwell  these cultural shows are received. The Member\r\n\r\nis  absolutely  right in saying that when  tourists\r\n\r\ncome here, they want to see something exotic of the\r\n\r\nOrient,  and  not some inferior imitation  of  what\r\n\r\nthey could see at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tourist Promotion Board also proposes, as\r\n\r\npart  of its long-term programme, to stage  once  a\r\n\r\nyear,    possibly   around   our    National    Day\r\n\r\nCelebrations, a cultural festival in which we  will\r\n\r\ninvite cultural troupes from the countries of South-east  Asia,  each  of  which has  got  dancers  and\r\n\r\nmusicians of very high standards. I do not think we\r\n\r\nwill be able to stage one this year, but certainly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  1971  we  should see something quite  good  and\r\n\r\nspectacular along these lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang asked who pays for the\r\n\r\nhotel cess. The answer is the consumer pays for it.\r\n\r\nI agree with the Member for Havelock that that is a\r\n\r\nvery good idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also asked for\r\n\r\ninformation  on a number of points.  I  have  taken\r\n\r\ndown notes, but I am having difficulty in trying to\r\n\r\ndecipher  my  own writing. So, if I  missed  out  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  points, I hope he will  excuse  me.  He\r\n\r\nasked  what is the standard for inclusion for  this\r\n\r\nthree  per  cent cess. There is a body in Singapore\r\n\r\ncalled, I think, Licensing Justices, and if anybody\r\n\r\nwants to sell intoxicating liquor as a business, he\r\n\r\nwill  have to obtain a licence from this body. They\r\n\r\ngrade  licences into \"first-class\", \"second-class\",\r\n\r\nand  so on. The conditions of a first-class licence\r\n\r\nare   spelt  out.  The  place  must  have   certain\r\n\r\nstandards  of  comfort or cleanliness and  drinking\r\n\r\nhours  are  more generous than those in  a  second-class  licence. So we think it is a good  thing  if\r\n\r\nall   those  who  have  first-class  public   house\r\n\r\nlicences,   i.e.,  licences  to  sell  intoxicating\r\n\r\nliquor, are included in this scheme. We will  leave\r\n\r\nout  the  third-class licences, otherwise you  will\r\n\r\nget all the coffee-shops into the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the island of Bali, we are ready to\r\n\r\nstart  off, but our partners, unfortunately, are  a\r\n\r\nbit  slow  in getting their money, their designers,\r\n\r\nor  whatever  it is. So while we hope to  get  this\r\n\r\nproject off the ground quickly, the private  sector\r\n\r\nis still dragging its feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shortage of cooks, the catering school,\r\n\r\nwhich is now being rapidly expanded, does of course\r\n\r\ngive training in cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> They are being trained in the Army!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Army also trains cooks. But I doubt whether\r\n\r\nthey  will find employment in our hotels! I  always\r\n\r\nbelieve that a good cook, like a painter, is  born.\r\n\r\nYou cannot train a man to be a first-class painter,\r\n\r\nnor can you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrain a man to be a first-class cook. However, how\r\n\r\nthese  hotels  are  going to  get  cooks  is  their\r\n\r\nbusiness. The Government has got enough worries  of\r\n\r\nits  own  and will not bother with the troubles  of\r\n\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock has made a very useful\r\n\r\nsuggestion,  and  that  is that  there  must  be  a\r\n\r\nminimum  charge of five cents, and everything  will\r\n\r\nbe  rounded off to five cents. I think we can  look\r\n\r\ninto  this in our regulations rather than spell  it\r\n\r\nout in the Bill itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are two notes,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) In page 1, line 4, to leave out \"1969\" and\r\n\r\ninsert \"1970\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In page 1, marginal title, to leave out \"and\r\n\r\ncommencement\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be done.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 9 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third\r\n\r\ntime and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Members  of  this House  are  aware  that\r\n\r\nentry   into   Singapore  is   governed   by   the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Ordinance, 1959, its regulations  and\r\n\r\norders made thereunder. These immigration laws have\r\n\r\nproved   to     be  extremely  effective   legal\r\n\r\ninstruments  in  attaining our  main  objective  of\r\n\r\ncontrolling  the  lawful  entry  of  persons   from\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore  and  ensuring,  among   other things,  that those who arrive for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nemployment   do  not prejudice  the  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities   of   citizens  and   other   lawful\r\n\r\npermanent residents of Singapore who have similar  or\r\n\r\ncorresponding qualifications and skills. The laws\r\n\r\nhave, however, failed to reduce or minimise illegal\r\n\r\nimmigration into the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members of this House are also aware that\r\n\r\nSingapore has a coastline which is about 79 miles\r\n\r\nlong and our shores are only a short distance away\r\n\r\nfrom the Malaysian mainland and from the nearest of\r\n\r\nthe   neighbouring  islands.  It is  a   near\r\n\r\nimpossible  task to patrol our territorial  waters\r\n\r\nall  the  time without incurring heavy unnecessary\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on the establishment of  an  effective\r\n\r\nand  credible sea patrol system to prevent  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigration into Singapore. The open nature of  our\r\n\r\ncoastline  with easy accessibility  both  from  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring Indonesian islands and from the  south\r\n\r\nof  Johore  makes illegal entry into  Singapore  an\r\n\r\neasy   task.   Once  in  Singapore,   the   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants   are  not  only  harboured   by   local\r\n\r\nresidents  and citizens but are also provided  with\r\n\r\nemployment   opportunities  in   contravention   of\r\n\r\nprevailing immigration and other labour laws of the\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full immigration control on travel between\r\n\r\nSingapore and West Malaysia was implemented on  1st\r\n\r\nJuly,  1967.  Despite this, however,  there  is  at\r\n\r\npresent  relatively free movement between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries  but there is no exit control  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  those who arrive for temporary visits of  one\r\n\r\nkind or the other leave the Republic within the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperiod of the authorised visit. Owing to the social\r\n\r\nand   economic   conditions   prevailing   in   the\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries, many  such  visitors  will\r\n\r\nwant  to remain in Singapore beyond the periods  of\r\n\r\ntheir  authorised  stay if their  presence  remains\r\n\r\nundetected. In addition, therefore, to  the  large\r\n\r\nnumber of illegal immigrants who enter Singapore, there  are large numbers of persons on Visit Passes\r\n\r\nwho   remain  here  unlawfully.  Since  1959,   the\r\n\r\nfollowing  persons  have been apprehended  by  the\r\n\r\nImmigration,  Police and Customs  Departments  for\r\n\r\nillegal   entry   or  for  contravention   of   the\r\n\r\nImmigration    Ordinance   or   regulations    made\r\n\r\nthereunder: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>     \r\n\r\n           Year       Number apprehended\r\n\r\n           1959              130\r\n\r\n           1960              360\r\n\r\n           1961              116\r\n\r\n           1962              140\r\n\r\n           1963              204\r\n\r\n           1964              436\r\n\r\n           1965              128\r\n\r\n           1966              854\r\n\r\n           1967            2,640\r\n\r\n           1968            2,980\r\n\r\n           1969            2,593  \r\n\r\n</pre>   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above figures give a rough idea of the size\r\n\r\nof the problem but do not reveal the true position,\r\n\r\nbecause there are probably thousands of others  who\r\n\r\nhave remained undetected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Department is doing all it can\r\n\r\nwithin the limits of its manpower and resources to\r\n\r\nremove  illegal immigrants and those who contravene\r\n\r\nthe    immigration   laws:   There   are    obvious\r\n\r\ndifficulties in removing such immigrants  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  apprehended. For instance, there  are  people\r\n\r\nwho  claim birth in Singapore but cannot produce  a\r\n\r\nshred  of  evidence to substantiate their claim  to\r\n\r\nlocal birth. Despite that, they refuse to return to\r\n\r\nwherever  they came from. Again, there  are  others\r\n\r\nwho  have established family ties with citizens and\r\n\r\nresidents of Singapore and, therefore, do  not  wish\r\n\r\nto  be removed or be separated from their families.\r\n\r\nIn  the  case  of  minor  children  of  tender  age\r\n\r\nparticularly  those under 15 years of age,  removal\r\n\r\nis all the more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficult because they cannot be removed to another\r\n\r\ncountry  to fend for themselves, if the whereabouts\r\n\r\nof  their parents and other near and dear ones  are\r\n\r\nnot known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill before the House is to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the hands of the Government  to  combat\r\n\r\neffectively the menace of illegal immigration,  and\r\n\r\nnot  only to deal a severe blow to traffickers  and\r\n\r\nharbourers  of  illegal and prohibited  immigrants,\r\n\r\nbut also to punish those who employ such persons in\r\n\r\ncontravention of the immigration laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 2 of the Bill introduces\r\n\r\nthe definitions of the words \"employ\" and \"harbour\"\r\n\r\nfor  purposes  of  the Immigration  Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\ndefinitions   are   simple  and   will   facilitate\r\n\r\nprosecutions  for the offence of employing  or,  as\r\n\r\nthe  case  may  be,  of harbouring  an  illegal  or\r\n\r\nprohibited immigrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that illegal immigrants may be severely\r\n\r\ndealt   with,  clause  3  provides  for  a  heavier\r\n\r\nsentence, on conviction, to imprisonment for a term\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding one year or to a fine not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$4,000  or to both such imprisonment and fine.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  hopes that the heavier  penalties  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  deterrent  effect and  thereby  reduce  or\r\n\r\nminimise  illegal immigration into  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nsentence  under  the  existing  law  is  half   the\r\n\r\npenalties  provided for under the Bill before  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression \"paragraph (a) of\" appearing in\r\n\r\nsubsection  (2)  of section 15 of  the  Immigration\r\n\r\nOrdinance is redundant as there is no paragraph (a)\r\n\r\nin  section 60 of the said Ordinance. Clause  4  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill,  therefore, introduces an  amendment  to\r\n\r\ndelete the above expression which is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the explanatory statement to the Bill states\r\n\r\nthat the principal amendments are to subsection (1)\r\n\r\nof  section  56 of the Immigration Ordinance  where\r\n\r\ntwo  new  offences are created, namely, trafficking\r\n\r\nin  prohibited or illegal immigrants and  employing\r\n\r\nany  such immigrants. In addition, opportunity  has\r\n\r\nbeen   taken  to  amend  paragraph  (a)   of   that\r\n\r\nsubsection by inserting the words \"enters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunlawfully or\" and amending the existing  paragraph\r\n\r\n(d)  of the same subsection dealing with harbouring\r\n\r\nof   an  illegal  or  prohibited  immigrant.  These\r\n\r\namendments, which are proposed in clause 5  of  the\r\n\r\nBill,  and  the  introduction  of  the  definitions\r\n\r\nproposed in clause 2 are, as has been stated above,\r\n\r\nto facilitate prosecutions under these provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 5 of the Bill also\r\n\r\nproposes  heavier  penalties  for  offences   under\r\n\r\nparagraphs  (a), (b) and (d) of subsection  (1)  of\r\n\r\nsection 56 of the Ordinance. The offences under the\r\n\r\nparagraphs  mentioned relate to entering unlawfully\r\n\r\nor  attempting  unlawfully to enter  Singapore,  or\r\n\r\nabetting   any   person  to  enter   Singapore   in\r\n\r\ncontravention   of   the   immigration   laws,   or\r\n\r\nharbouring  an  illegal or a prohibited  immigrant.\r\n\r\nThe penalties which have been proposed are twice as\r\n\r\nheavy  as  those  provided for under  the  existing\r\n\r\nprovisions and should go a long way in helping  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   curb  illegal  immigration   into\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the new offence of employing an\r\n\r\nillegal  or prohibited immigrant, the penalty  will\r\n\r\nbe  similar  to  that for the offence  of  unlawful\r\n\r\nentry  or  abetment  of  such  an  offence  or  for\r\n\r\nharbouring illegal or prohibited immigrants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the other new offence of trafficking,\r\n\r\nhowever,  it  is proposed for the consideration  of\r\n\r\nthis House that the penalty imposed be imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor  a  term of two years and a fine not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$4,000.  This  will  have  a  deterrent  effect  on\r\n\r\ntraffickers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot agree more with the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Defence that our  Government  should\r\n\r\nplug  up the loopholes in our immigration laws.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  we should hold the Minister responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe  situation we are in today where a few thousand\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants are undetectable in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs stated by him,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  number  of illegal entries into  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not have quarrelled with him on this\r\n\r\namending  Bill had he been a little far-sighted  on\r\n\r\nthe provision in regard to the legal immigrants and\r\n\r\nthe illegal immigrants. This amending Bill does not\r\n\r\nmake  a  clear distinction between the  case  of  a\r\n\r\nlegal  immigrant who comes to Singapore on a  Visit\r\n\r\nPass  and  who is entitled to stay only within  the\r\n\r\nauthorised  period,  and the  case  of  an  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrant. What I find fault with this Bill is that\r\n\r\nthe  two  types of immigrants come under  the  same\r\n\r\nprovision  and  the  one with the  Visit  Pass  who\r\n\r\noverstays receives the same penalty as the  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrant.  In other words, if the legal  immigrant\r\n\r\nhas  overstayed  the authorised period  through  an\r\n\r\noversight, he could be punished by a fine of $4,000\r\n\r\nor  two  years'  gaol  or even  both.  The  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrant who is unfortunate to be arrested is also\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the same penalty. Hence  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndistinction   between   the   two   categories   of\r\n\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this Bill is passed without some form of\r\n\r\ndifferentiation  between the two categories,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  it  will attract a lot of criticism from  the\r\n\r\npublic.  I  may  have to defend  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence  for  his short-sightedness! Of  course.  I\r\n\r\nwill  not  join with the public in criticising  the\r\n\r\nMinister because he is my colleague. But the public\r\n\r\nwill  say  that  the Minister cannot  differentiate\r\n\r\nbetween  the  legal and the illegal immigrants.  I,\r\n\r\ntherefore, sincerely urge the Minister to look into\r\n\r\nmy suggestion and make some form of differentiation\r\n\r\nbetween these two categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to seek clarification on\r\n\r\nthe precise status of people from West Malaysia who\r\n\r\nwere  in Singapore prior to the imposition of  full\r\n\r\nimmigration control.

He says that there is no distinction\r\n\r\nin the Bill between those who overstay in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  those who have come in illegally. In the  eyes\r\n\r\nof  the  law, I think a person who has stayed  here\r\n\r\nlonger  than he is permitted to is also an  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrant.

I think the general rule\r\n\r\napplies. If a person from West Malaysia is  staying\r\n\r\nhere  and  holds a Singapore identity card,  he  is\r\n\r\nallowed to stay here unless he leaves Singapore, in\r\n\r\nwhich case he would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntravelling on some sort of a document.

Therefore, once he is  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  he will be treated in the same  way  as\r\n\r\nother  visitors from outside Singapore.

I shall now explain the reasons\r\n\r\nmotivating the introduction of the Bill  and  deal\r\n\r\nonly with the salient provisions thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law in force relating to surveyors is\r\n\r\ncontained in the Surveyors Ordinance (Chapter 201).\r\n\r\nThis  Ordinance provides for licensed surveyors  to\r\n\r\nsurvey  land  and  prepare  plans  for  provisional\r\n\r\nregistration  of  deeds in the Registry  of  Deeds.\r\n\r\nFinal  surveys  and  plans,  as  required  by  the\r\n\r\nRegistration of Deeds Ordinance (Chapter  255)  and\r\n\r\nby the Land Titles Ordinance, 1956, have to be done\r\n\r\nby  the  Survey Department and the plans in respect\r\n\r\nof  these  surveys  duly  certified  by  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSurveyor. The need for final surveys to be  carried\r\n\r\nout by the Survey Department arose from the lacunae\r\n\r\nin  our  law  which  did not require  surveyors  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  their  survey records and  computations  to\r\n\r\nthat   Department,  nor  were  they   required   to\r\n\r\ndemarcate  the land surveyed by them with permanent\r\n\r\nboundary marks. In the past, final surveys of  land\r\n\r\nneeded for development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the private sector did not pose too much  of  a\r\n\r\nproblem. However, the intense development  of  land\r\n\r\nover    the    past   few   years   arising    from\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  and  housing   has   imposed   a\r\n\r\nmounting burden on the Survey Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing volume of survey work has made it\r\n\r\ndesirable for surveys of privately-owned land to be\r\n\r\nbest  left  to  licensed surveyors in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  just  as  the designing  of  building  for\r\n\r\nprivate  individuals and firms is generally carried\r\n\r\nout  by  architects in private practice. This  will\r\n\r\nthus  obviate duplication in survey work and enable\r\n\r\npurchasers of land in the private sector to  obtain\r\n\r\ntheir titles to land more expeditiously, apart from\r\n\r\nenabling  the  Survey Department to concentrate  on\r\n\r\nsurvey   works   for  Government  departments   and\r\n\r\nbringing  up  to date litho-production  and  survey\r\n\r\nrecords  which are presently unavoidably neglected.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  surveyors attached to Statutory  Boards\r\n\r\nby  carrying out final surveys of the Boards'  land\r\n\r\ncould  thus  enable industrialists to obtain  their\r\n\r\ntitles  expeditiously  and assist  them  to  obtain\r\n\r\nloans  on mortgage of properties leased to them  by\r\n\r\nthe  Boards. The transfer of this function  to  the\r\n\r\nlicensed  surveyors in the private sector, however,\r\n\r\nnecessitates introduction of necessary  legislation\r\n\r\nto  control their activities and conduct as in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  other  professional bodies  such  as  the\r\n\r\narchitects,   accountants,   and   advocates    and\r\n\r\nsolicitors;  hence the Bill now  before  the  House\r\n\r\nwhich  will  also  repeal the  out-dated  Surveyors\r\n\r\nOrdinance (Chapter 201).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides, inter alia, for the\r\n\r\nconstitution of a Land Surveyors Board as  outlined\r\n\r\nin clause 3 thereof and with powers -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to register any person who is not less than\r\n\r\n21   years  of  age  and  who  is  resident   in\r\n\r\nSingapore   as   registered   surveyor   if   he\r\n\r\nsatisfies the Board that -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) immediately before the coming into operation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the Act he is a licensed surveyor; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) he has obtained a certificate of\r\n\r\ncompetency  issued  by  the  Board   after\r\n\r\npassing the prescribed examination; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) he has passed a professional examination\r\n\r\nrecognised  by  the Board and  has  passed\r\n\r\nsuch  further  examination  and  has  such\r\n\r\npractical   experience  in  surveying   in\r\n\r\nSingapore as the Board may prescribe;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to refuse to register an applicant who is\r\n\r\nnot,  in  the  opinion of the  Board,  of  good\r\n\r\ncharacter and reputation;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to order the cancellation of the registration\r\n\r\nof    a    registered   surveyor   in   certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to make rules, with the approval of the\r\n\r\nMinister,  to give effect to the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an offence under clause 17 of the Bill for\r\n\r\nany  person  to make or cause any falsification  of\r\n\r\nthe  register  or to make any false  or  fraudulent\r\n\r\ndeclaration to procure registration. Clause 18  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  also  forbids a  person  who  is  not  a\r\n\r\nregistered surveyor from engaging in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A registered surveyor shall be entitled under the\r\n\r\nprovisions of clause 19 to undertake title surveys.\r\n\r\nWhat is a \"title survey\" is defined in clause 2  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill. Where a registered surveyor is engaged on\r\n\r\nthe title survey of any land in respect of which  a\r\n\r\ndeposit  for  survey  fees  has  been  made  by  an\r\n\r\napplicant  for  subdivision of the land  under  the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Ordinance, 1959, he  shall  be  paid  the\r\n\r\nprescribed  fees  by the Chief Surveyor  from  such\r\n\r\ndeposit in accordance with any rules made under the\r\n\r\nAct. This is provided for in clause 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A novel feature of this Bill is the requirement\r\n\r\nlaid  down  in clause 21 that, on completion  of  a\r\n\r\ntitle survey, the registered surveyor who signs the\r\n\r\nplan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthereof  shall deposit such plan together with  the\r\n\r\nrelevant field books, calculation sheets and survey\r\n\r\ndata  with  the  Survey  Department  and  all  such\r\n\r\ndocuments  shall, if such plan is approved  by  the\r\n\r\nChief Surveyor or other officer appointed by him to\r\n\r\napprove the same on his behalf, become the property\r\n\r\nof  the  Government and shall be filed as permanent\r\n\r\nsurvey records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 of the Bill imposes an obligation on a\r\n\r\nregistered surveyor who has prepared and signed any\r\n\r\nassurance plan to complete the title survey of  the\r\n\r\nland  described  in  such plan within  a  specified\r\n\r\nperiod. A registered surveyor who fails to complete\r\n\r\nthe title survey within the specified period may be\r\n\r\nliable  to  disciplinary action and the  Board  may\r\n\r\norder  another surveyor to complete the  work.  Any\r\n\r\nregistered   surveyor  against  whom   disciplinary\r\n\r\naction  has  been  taken by the Board,  may  appeal\r\n\r\nagainst  the  decision of the  Board  to  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt. This is provided for in clause 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that land surveys by\r\n\r\nregistered  surveyors  are  properly  carried  out,\r\n\r\nprovision  has been made in the Bill for the  Chief\r\n\r\nSurveyor  to approve all survey plans or  assurance\r\n\r\nplans  prepared by them before such  plans  can  be\r\n\r\naccepted for the purposes of registration under any\r\n\r\nwritten  law.

Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill\r\n\r\nbe now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall the statement made in this\r\n\r\nHouse  at  the  last sitting by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, which outlined in some detail the need  to\r\n\r\nrevise  the  present  sewerage  fees  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirement  of the World Bank for an  $18  million\r\n\r\nloan to help finance the foreign exchange component\r\n\r\nof the cost of our sewerage expansion projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several proposals for the revision of the\r\n\r\nsewerage  tariff  had  been considered.  The  basic\r\n\r\nquestion  was whether the proposed increase  should\r\n\r\nbe based on the number of sanitary fittings, or the\r\n\r\nvolume  of sewage and trade waste discharge,  or  a\r\n\r\ncombination of both. Eventually, it was decided  to\r\n\r\nlevy  an  additional charge of 20 cents  per  1,000\r\n\r\ngallons  of  metered water consumed in addition  to\r\n\r\nthe  existing  fee of $2 per sanitary  fitting  per\r\n\r\nmonth now being levied on domestic premises. In the\r\n\r\ncase   of  non-domestic  premises,  the  additional\r\n\r\ncharge  levied  is  50 cents per 1,000  gallons  of\r\n\r\nmetered water consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposition of a flat rate means that all\r\n\r\nregistered consumers of water, including those  now\r\n\r\nnot served with modern sanitation, will have to pay\r\n\r\nthe  additional  charge.  It  is  hoped  that  some\r\n\r\nhouseholders will become less reluctant to  abandon\r\n\r\nthe  bucket-system if they have to  pay  a  charge,\r\n\r\nsmall  as it is, for a sanitary service which  they\r\n\r\ndo  not  enjoy. And, in order to be fair  to  those\r\n\r\nconsumers  of  water  now  not  served  by   modern\r\n\r\nsanitation,  the Public Works Department  would  be\r\n\r\nduty-bound to extend its sewerage facilities to all\r\n\r\nsuch consumers as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it now stands, subsection (1) of section 43 of\r\n\r\nthe  Local Government Integration Ordinance,  1963,\r\n\r\nonly empowers the Director of Public Works\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  levy a fee on one or more sanitary fittings. To\r\n\r\nenable  Government  to give  effect  to  the  above\r\n\r\ndecision, it is necessary to amend the Ordinance in\r\n\r\norder that the Director may also levy a fee on  the\r\n\r\namount of water used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last nine years some $69 million has been\r\n\r\nspent on sewerage projects and today just over half\r\n\r\nour  population is served by modern sanitation. The\r\n\r\nlong-term  objective of Government  is  to  provide\r\n\r\nsewerage facilities throughout the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More money is needed as the provision of modern\r\n\r\nsanitation  is  costly; the  proposed  revision  of\r\n\r\ntariff  is expected to result in additional revenue\r\n\r\nof  $4.2 million in 1970, and $4.8 million in 1972.\r\n\r\nHowever,  as  pointed  out  by  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance,  the  majority of consumers  will  not  be\r\n\r\nrequired to pay more than an additional sum  of  $1\r\n\r\nper month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment Bill is directly\r\n\r\nthe result of the Ministerial statement made by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance in this House on Tuesday, 23rd\r\n\r\nDecember last year, in which he disclosed that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intends  to  levy  a  sewage  fee   and\r\n\r\nincrease the charges for water consumed both in the\r\n\r\ndomestic  and  commercial sectors.  Just  now,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Law  and  National  Development,  in\r\n\r\nmoving the Second Reading of this Bill, pointed out\r\n\r\nthat  after  some consideration it was  decided  to\r\n\r\nimpose  the  increase  on all consumers  of  water,\r\n\r\nwhether they enjoy sewerage facilities or not.  You\r\n\r\nwill  remember, Sir, that many questions were asked\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister for Finance arising  out  of  his\r\n\r\nMinisterial statement, and the answers he gave have\r\n\r\nthrown  some  light on the reasons  compelling  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to resort to taking such measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having gone through the Ministerial statement,\r\n\r\nSir,  and also the answers to subsequent questions,\r\n\r\nand the Bill, it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  obvious  to everybody that the days of  cheaper\r\n\r\npublic  utilities are gone. In other words, nothing\r\n\r\nis  free today. For that matter, no government  can\r\n\r\nafford  to  pay a heavy subsidy on public utilities\r\n\r\nwithout  bringing  the country to  economic  chaos.\r\n\r\nThis   has  been  so  in  several  countries  where\r\n\r\npolitical issues arise out of such matters,  but  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  we  will fall into  this  pit.  For\r\n\r\nexample, Sir, medical facilities in Singapore  were\r\n\r\nfree  some time ago. Today charges are being levied\r\n\r\non those who seek them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we see the rates of water increased. In the\r\n\r\nlast  few years the rates ranging from 60 cents  to\r\n\r\n$1.30  per 1,000 gallons have been increased to  80\r\n\r\ncents  to  $1.50,  together  with  a  10  per  cent\r\n\r\nGovernment  tax.  This  increase,  I  believe,  was\r\n\r\ncarried  out  in 1966. And even though these  extra\r\n\r\ncharges  or levies will be collected by the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board on behalf of the Government, to the\r\n\r\nconsumers they definitely mean an increase  on  the\r\n\r\nrates  they  are  paying now. Together  with  this,\r\n\r\nthere is an extra levy of $2 per fitting per month.\r\n\r\nThis  adds up to an increase of nearly 50 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the  rates, as compared with the increase  over\r\n\r\nthe last few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, Sir, this increase will impose a\r\n\r\nheavier  burden on the consumers, especially  those\r\n\r\nin  the  lower income group, i.e., the farmers  and\r\n\r\nlabourers.  And  we  know that the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nfurther  increases cannot be ruled out because  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance was non-committal in his reply\r\n\r\nto  my  question  at the sitting  on  the  23rd  of\r\n\r\nDecember last. Hence I suspect that there  must  be\r\n\r\nmore valid and cogent reasons than this, and I feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government owes the people an answer.  I\r\n\r\nhope it will not be failing in its duty to disclose\r\n\r\nthe  other  reasons which prompt it  to  make  such\r\n\r\ncharges  and increases. The people, I am  positive,\r\n\r\nwill be ready to accept these increased charges  if\r\n\r\nthey  fully  understand the intentions  behind  the\r\n\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one cannot run away from the fact that water\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  means  life  or  death  to  us.  The\r\n\r\nmajority of our people depend on pipe-water, and if\r\n\r\nthey are deprived of it, then I think hell will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbreak  loose.  We all know that the Government  has\r\n\r\ntaken  pains  to ensure that water is  readily  and\r\n\r\neasily  available. But I am arguing this  from  the\r\n\r\npoint  of  view of the extra 20 per cent charge  on\r\n\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> 20 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am sorry, a 20-cent charge per 1,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nWe  know  that  water is a precious  and  priceless\r\n\r\ncommodity.  We also know that it is imported,  like\r\n\r\nother  raw materials, and has to be treated  before\r\n\r\nit  can  be consumed. Let me then add that  because\r\n\r\nit is precious, it is therefore worth the price we\r\n\r\nare asked to pay. I fully support this move, but  I\r\n\r\nmust   ask   the  Minister  for  Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  what steps are being taken  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat water will always be readily available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the World Bank has given us an $18\r\n\r\nmillion  loan  to develop our sewerage  facilities,\r\n\r\nmay  I  ask  him what concrete plans are  afoot  to\r\n\r\nextend sewerage facilities throughout the Republic?\r\n\r\nAlso,  what  concrete plans are in hand  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  by  the  early or the late  l970s  the  whole\r\n\r\ncountry  and its people will enjoy modern  sewerage\r\n\r\nfacilities? Because by then no one can quibble that\r\n\r\nhe  has  to shoulder the burden of increased  water\r\n\r\ncharges   while   others  who  are  enjoying   such\r\n\r\nfacilities are not similarly charged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are always people who\r\n\r\ntake   things   for  granted.  From   them   little\r\n\r\nappreciation can be expected, except that they will\r\n\r\nalways  grumble whenever there is an imposition  of\r\n\r\nincreased  taxes  or charges. To me,  these  people\r\n\r\nnever  seem to understand, for example, that  water\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  imported and stored and  also  treated\r\n\r\nchemically before it can be piped into their  homes\r\n\r\nand made safe for drinking. The process involved, I\r\n\r\nam  told, is both complicated and costly. To  these\r\n\r\npeople,  Sir, let me say this: think of  what  they\r\n\r\nare getting, and ask themselves whether it is worth\r\n\r\nthe price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been fortunate enough to travel\r\n\r\noutside the Republic on several occasions.  In  the\r\n\r\ncourse of such tours\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  came  across some countries in Asia  and  Europe\r\n\r\nwhere  one  cannot drink the pipe-water. Therefore,\r\n\r\none  has  to  buy mineral water or beer  to  quench\r\n\r\none's thirst. What is the difference, one may  then\r\n\r\nask?  The  difference is that  such  pipe-water  is\r\n\r\noften  muddy  and  dirty and is meant  for  washing\r\n\r\nonly.  I  am also told that if one drinks from  the\r\n\r\ntap, one gets sick because the water has never been\r\n\r\ntreated  chemically. I am sure we do not want  that\r\n\r\nto happen to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a city state with a population of\r\n\r\nsome  8,800 persons per square mile. As this number\r\n\r\nwill increase each year, we cannot afford to and we\r\n\r\ndo  not  wish  to  have non-treated or  undrinkable\r\n\r\nwater from our taps, as is found in some countries.\r\n\r\nSir, I believe this situation is unwelcome not only\r\n\r\non  health grounds but also because we do not  wish\r\n\r\nour  people  to quench their thirst  with  beer  or\r\n\r\nmineral  water.  With respect, Sir,  the  situation\r\n\r\nthat  exists  in those countries could  be  due  to\r\n\r\ncertain  prevailing conditions, but we in Singapore\r\n\r\ncertainly   want  our  water  crystal   clear   and\r\n\r\ndrinkable straight from the tap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again may I reiterate that the price we will\r\n\r\nbe  paying  for  water is well worth  it.  But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment must take steps to explain the  proposed\r\n\r\nincrease  in  charges,  whether  they  be  due   to\r\n\r\nsewerage fittings, sanitary fittings, or in respect\r\n\r\nof water consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fully supporting this amending Bill, I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister concerned will  look  into  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of supplying water to the remotest village\r\n\r\nor  kampong  in  the Republic where well  water  is\r\n\r\nstill  being used. This is most unhygienic and  bad\r\n\r\nfor  health. During the past two years  or  so  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  conducted  several  exercises   to\r\n\r\nremove public standpipes. It has instead encouraged\r\n\r\nthose people relying on standpipes to connect water\r\n\r\nto  their  homes.  Much has been achieved  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect, and, as a result, many remote villages and\r\n\r\nkampongs have benefited. But there is still much to\r\n\r\nbe  done  in  supplying pipe-water to the  remotest\r\n\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know for a fact that many poultry and pig\r\n\r\nfarmers are today making use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  pipe-water in the course of their work and they\r\n\r\nhave to pay for it at the commercial rate. However,\r\n\r\nthese  farms are in the rural areas and I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance will consider their case. It\r\n\r\nis a bit unfair to these people to have to pay more\r\n\r\nfor  the water consumed when, in fact, they do  not\r\n\r\nenjoy  sewerage  facilities. No doubt,  the  answer\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the  Minister for Finance  at  the  last\r\n\r\nsitting  of Parliament was that a line  had  to  be\r\n\r\ndrawn  somehow. However, let us hope that the  line\r\n\r\ndrawn  will  not  result in a lop-sided  tax  which\r\n\r\nimposes a heavier burden on these farmers. I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the Minister for Finance will give special\r\n\r\nconsideration  to the consumers  of  water  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas by reducing the rate of Government tax.\r\n\r\nAfter all, they do not enjoy sewerage facilities. I\r\n\r\nam  positive  that, as citizens,  the  people  will\r\n\r\nunderstand  their  responsibility  to  the   State.\r\n\r\nHowever, a clear explanation must be given to them,\r\n\r\notherwise  they will think that in spite  of  their\r\n\r\npoor condition the Government is being hard on them\r\n\r\nin  making a general imposition of increased  water\r\n\r\ncharges   irrespective  of  whether  or   not   the\r\n\r\nconsumers enjoy sewerage facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, whilst once again expressing my full\r\n\r\nsupport  for  this Bill, I hope the  two  Ministers\r\n\r\nconcerned will carefully consider the points I have\r\n\r\njust now raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate that with a\r\n\r\ngrowing population resulting in an increase in  the\r\n\r\nnumber   of   houses,  flats  and  factories,   the\r\n\r\nconsumption  of  water in Singapore will  increase.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  water supply is low, there  is  need  to\r\n\r\nconserve water. For this purpose, I agree  that  as\r\n\r\nan  inducement to conserve water it is necessary to\r\n\r\nincrease the water charges. But the reason given by\r\n\r\nthe Minister is that, because of the development of\r\n\r\nmodern  sanitation, it is necessary to recover  the\r\n\r\nincreased expenditure. Hence, for this purpose, the\r\n\r\nMinister has proposed an increase of 20 cents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper 1,000 gallons of water for domestic use. I wish\r\n\r\nto point out that even with the further development\r\n\r\nof  modern  sanitation, not everyone  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be served with modern sanitation. The  people\r\n\r\nin  the  rural districts will still not  be  served\r\n\r\nwith it for some time. It would seem that by paying\r\n\r\nincreased water charges, these people are  in  fact\r\n\r\npaying for modern sanitation for urban dwellers.  I\r\n\r\nam  afraid  this does not seem fair  to  the  rural\r\n\r\ndwellers.  The Minister may argue that  the  people\r\n\r\nenjoying modern sanitation will be using more water\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  use of water  closets  and  will,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  be paying more for their water  supply.\r\n\r\nBut the average amount of water used per day in the\r\n\r\nwater  closets in a home is negligible and  so  the\r\n\r\nburden  of  the  increased water charges  is  still\r\n\r\nequally  borne  by those without modern  sanitation\r\n\r\nand those with modern sanitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to satisfy both purposes - conserving\r\n\r\nwater  and developing modern sanitation - I  propose\r\n\r\nthat part of the increased expenditure be recovered\r\n\r\nby an increase in water charges and the rest of the\r\n\r\nincreased  expenditure be recovered  by  increasing\r\n\r\ncharges for water closets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it appears to me that the need to\r\n\r\nincrease   water  charges  has  not  been  properly\r\n\r\nexplained  to the people in general. I  would  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to take steps to explain  clearly  to\r\n\r\nthe  mass  the reason behind the need  to  increase\r\n\r\nwater charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first take advantage of\r\n\r\nthis   opportunity  to  congratulate  you  on  your\r\n\r\nelection to the Speakership and to assure you of my\r\n\r\ncontinuing regard for your office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill which is under discussion now seeks to\r\n\r\nauthorise  the  Government to  levy  fees  for  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of sewage and trade effluent and  for  the\r\n\r\namount  of  water used on premises.  But  the  main\r\n\r\nburden seems to be the increase in the charges  for\r\n\r\nthe  consumption of water. Water, Sir, is the  main\r\n\r\nburden of my comment. As the Member for Punggol has\r\n\r\ncommented, water is an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextremely  precious commodity in Singapore.  I  can\r\n\r\nrecollect  that  it was not so  long  ago  when  we\r\n\r\nexperienced  the  discomfort  of  rationing,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  a  rather dry spell. More recently,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we suffered from a surfeit of water.  But,\r\n\r\nhowever  much  rain  may  fall,  water  has  to  be\r\n\r\ncollected, stored, processed, treated and purified,\r\n\r\nand the supply must be transmitted and distributed.\r\n\r\nThere  must be maintenance of these activities  and\r\n\r\nthere  must  be,  in  addition,  an  administrative\r\n\r\ncharge for the collection of rates. Obviously,  the\r\n\r\nscale  of  expenditure involved must  be  enormous.\r\n\r\nJust for the sake of comparison, although it is not\r\n\r\nrelevant,  before  coming into this  House  earlier\r\n\r\ntoday,  I  read in a recent issue of the  Tunes  of\r\n\r\nLondon  that  for  a  study of how  to  purify  the\r\n\r\nThames,  which  is becoming apparently  a  sort  of\r\n\r\nmassive sewage disposal channel, the cost is half a\r\n\r\nmillion pounds. But coming closer home, Sir, it was\r\n\r\nonly   last   year  that  Seletar   Reservoir   was\r\n\r\nofficially   opened.  This  effective   engineering\r\n\r\nachievement has resulted in multiplying  our  total\r\n\r\nreservoir  capacity  by four times,  increasing  it\r\n\r\nfrom   1,750  million  gallons  to  6,900   million\r\n\r\ngallons.  I obtained the figures from the  brochure\r\n\r\nwhich  the Ministry of National Development  issued\r\n\r\nin  commemoration of the opening. But  the  Seletar\r\n\r\nproject  cost  $27 million, and we had  to  find  a\r\n\r\nsource of foreign exchange for nearly half of  this\r\n\r\nsum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not the mere cost in terms of dollars\r\n\r\nand  cents  that we have to consider. Let  us  note\r\n\r\nthat the water surface of Seletar Reservoir is  800\r\n\r\nacres.  Sir,  let me ask the Minister for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  how  many  acres  of  land   have   we\r\n\r\nreclaimed   from  the  sea.  It  is  an   odd   but\r\n\r\nnonetheless real fact of our existence that, on the\r\n\r\none  hand,  we  try our best to increase  our  land\r\n\r\nacreage  by converting sea into land, and,  on  the\r\n\r\nother hand, in the centre of our island we have  to\r\n\r\nconvert valuable real estate into masses of  water.\r\n\r\nBoth operations cost a great deal of money. Even if\r\n\r\nwe  were to think of the operation of attempting to\r\n\r\nchange sea water into fresh water, we have to spend\r\n\r\neven\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore, if at all this were commercially feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this should indicate that water is an\r\n\r\nexpensive (besides being a precious) commodity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look at the question from another angle: water\r\n\r\nin   its  original  form  would  not  be  safe  for\r\n\r\ndrinking.   There  are  all  sorts  of  pollutional\r\n\r\nelements  in water. The effect of contamination  is\r\n\r\nto  add  all  sorts of micro-organisms,  add  algae\r\n\r\nbacteria  and  so  on, as well  as  colour,  taste,\r\n\r\nsmell,  alkalinity, turbidity and poison to  water.\r\n\r\nBut  the  community, on the other hand, and rightly\r\n\r\nso, insist and should insist that water be not only\r\n\r\nsafe  to  drink, but also agreeable in  appearance,\r\n\r\ntaste  and  smell, so that it may be properly  used\r\n\r\nfor  domestic and other purposes. At the same time,\r\n\r\nwater  must contain substances that should  prevent\r\n\r\nit  from being corrosive to metals, and indeed that\r\n\r\nit  should contribute to the dental health  of  our\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This demand for water, with all the desirable\r\n\r\nqualities  I referred to, has to take into  account\r\n\r\nthe   capital,  labour  and  skill  that  go   into\r\n\r\nconverting water in an undrinkable state  to  water\r\n\r\nin its eminently potable form that emerges from our\r\n\r\ntaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, as the Member for Punggol has also\r\n\r\npointed out, when we open the tap for water we  may\r\n\r\nimmediately receive it in a glass to drink at once.\r\n\r\nLet  us remember that there are places where to  do\r\n\r\nthis  would be very hazardous indeed. When  I  note\r\n\r\nhow  efficiently we are served with water,  hot  or\r\n\r\ncold,  I  remember  that such  efficiency  may  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily characterise supply in other countries.\r\n\r\nI  remember  an  instance when  I  was  visiting  a\r\n\r\ncertain  country and I had occasion either to  turn\r\n\r\non the tap or the electric switch. What I turned on\r\n\r\nwas  not quite important, but some of my colleagues\r\n\r\nhere  will  bear  me out that, as a  result  of  my\r\n\r\naction,  water  began  to  fountain  out  in   fair\r\n\r\nquantity from the electrical fixing on the ceiling!\r\n\r\nOther  odd experiences I have had too, all of which\r\n\r\nhave  strengthened my healthy regard for the people\r\n\r\nin  our  community  who  are  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nprovision of water to our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, finally, that while we have to reserve\r\n\r\nlarge  sums of money for installations like Seletar\r\n\r\nReservoir and that we have to charge our people for\r\n\r\nthis,  the  sooner we can make places like  Seletar\r\n\r\nReservoir a recreational resort for our people, the\r\n\r\nbetter. Bearing in mind that the public use of  the\r\n\r\nprecincts  of  reservoirs has to be accompanied  by\r\n\r\nsafeguards  against pollution, it is  obvious  that\r\n\r\nthe  more intensive use is put to such places,  the\r\n\r\nmore  economic it will be and the more readily will\r\n\r\nour  people  accept the burden of extra charge  for\r\n\r\nwater  utilities. I would imagine  that  the  first\r\n\r\nreaction  to this increase in charge would  be  for\r\n\r\none    to    deprecate   it,   but   after   fuller\r\n\r\nconsideration, I am sure it will have  the  support\r\n\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.  Before I come to the substance  of  my\r\n\r\nspeech,  perhaps I may be permitted to  comment  on\r\n\r\nsome  of the points raised by previous speakers  in\r\n\r\nso  far  as  they  concern economic  and  financial\r\n\r\npolicy.  I am sure that my colleague, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law  and National Development, will deal  with\r\n\r\nthe other aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Back-benchers have said, and indeed have\r\n\r\nemphasised,   that  water  is   a   very   precious\r\n\r\ncommodity. One would have thought, therefore,  that\r\n\r\nthey  would  be concerned not over the increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  price  of  water, but whether we are  charging\r\n\r\nsufficiently  high  rates  for  such   a   precious\r\n\r\ncommodity to ensure that it is not being wasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol says that farmers and\r\n\r\nresidents  of  rural  areas are  not  being  fairly\r\n\r\ntreated  in  this respect. They pay this additional\r\n\r\n20  cents  per 1,000 gallons of water and  some  of\r\n\r\nthem  do  not  have sewerage facilities.  They  use\r\n\r\nwater to feed chickens and pigs. Of course, if they\r\n\r\ndo  so they must be prepared to pay the price.  But\r\n\r\nthat  is  not  my point. My point  is  this.  On  a\r\n\r\nprevious occasion I said that there must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  some rough justice in this. If we were to go by\r\n\r\nthe  strict rule of charging the consumer the  cost\r\n\r\nof the water he uses, then, of course, those people\r\n\r\nin  farms and the rural areas would not have to pay\r\n\r\nthis 20 cents extra. If we were to charge them  the\r\n\r\nactual  cost  of bringing water to the farms,  they\r\n\r\nmight  well have to pay $1.50 for 1,000 gallons  of\r\n\r\nwater  and  not 80 cents. So farmers and others  in\r\n\r\nthe  countryside should be thankful that  they  are\r\n\r\ngetting  water  so cheaply now. I think  that  also\r\n\r\ngoes for what the Member for Anson said about water\r\n\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to approach\r\n\r\nthis  subject from a wider viewpoint. This  is  the\r\n\r\nentire  question of our water supplies in  relation\r\n\r\nto  our  past, present and future needs  and,  more\r\n\r\nparticularly,  to take into account our  dependence\r\n\r\non  external sources for our water supplies.  Until\r\n\r\nthe Government took measures to increase the supply\r\n\r\nand  storage  capacity on the island  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nitself,  we  were  dependent on  our  supplies  and\r\n\r\nstorage  of water on Johore for nearly all  of  our\r\n\r\nwater requirements. Seletar Reservoir was completed\r\n\r\nlast  year, but until then Singapore produced  only\r\n\r\n18  million  gallons a day out of the  102  million\r\n\r\ngallons a day consumed. Therefore, more than 82 per\r\n\r\ncent  of  our  water consumption was supplied  from\r\n\r\nJohore.  With the completion of the Seletar scheme,\r\n\r\nwe  are  now  able  to supply 40 per  cent  of  our\r\n\r\nrequirements. This is an improvement but it is  not\r\n\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the completion of Seletar Reservoir,\r\n\r\nstorage  capacity in Singapore was enough for  only\r\n\r\ntwo  weeks' supply. With Seletar Reservoir, we  now\r\n\r\nhave  just  over  two months' supply.  This  is  an\r\n\r\nimprovement  but again it is not adequate.  So  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  its agency, the  Public  Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard,  are  proceeding  with  further  schemes  to\r\n\r\nincrease  storage capacity and to get more  sources\r\n\r\nof  supply  of  water from the island  itself.  The\r\n\r\nP.U.B. has  worked  out several  schemes  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.  They are now in the process  of  engaging\r\n\r\nconsultants    to   design   and   supervise    the\r\n\r\nconstruction of two water supply and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstorage  schemes: one in the Kranji  area  and  the\r\n\r\nother  in  the  Ulu Pandan area. Construction  will\r\n\r\nprobably  start next year and will be completed  in\r\n\r\n1974.  By then we would increase significantly  the\r\n\r\npercentage of local requirements, which can be  met\r\n\r\nfrom supplies on the island itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hon.  Members will, without question, accept  the\r\n\r\nproposition that we should be dependent  as  little\r\n\r\nas  possible  on outside supplies for  so  vital  a\r\n\r\nproduct as water. To do otherwise would be to  give\r\n\r\ndangerous hostages to fortune. If they accept  this\r\n\r\nproposition,   Members   must   also   accept   the\r\n\r\ninevitable  consequences that  flow  from  it.  The\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of water supply and storage facilities\r\n\r\non  the  island itself is more costly than  getting\r\n\r\nthem  from  across the Straits of Johore.  If  this\r\n\r\nwere  not  the  case, our water engineers  in  past\r\n\r\ndecades  would have been doing what  we  are  doing\r\n\r\nnow. Already the cost of producing and distributing\r\n\r\nwater to domestic households exceeds the rate of 80\r\n\r\ncents per 1,000 gallons which they are paying. With\r\n\r\nthe  completion of the new schemes I have mentioned\r\n\r\nand  others,  the cost will increase. This  follows\r\n\r\nlogically. Water engineers will begin with the most\r\n\r\neconomical  projects first, which, in the  case  of\r\n\r\nthe  island  of Singapore, is the Seletar  project.\r\n\r\nThen   they  go  on  to  more  expensive  and  less\r\n\r\neconomical  means of collecting and storing  water.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the price we have to pay for  not  giving\r\n\r\nunnecessary hostages to fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present increase in water rates is to pay for\r\n\r\nsewerage   services  which,  in  the   past,   were\r\n\r\nsubsidised  by  the  general taxpayer.  So  to  the\r\n\r\nquestion  asked by the Member for Punggol to  which\r\n\r\nhe  wants  an  unequivocal answer -\"Will  there  be\r\n\r\nfurther  increases in water rates?\" - I  say,  yes,\r\n\r\nthere will be further increases in the water rates.\r\n\r\nSo  those  who grumble at the present  increase  in\r\n\r\nwater rates should bear in mind the deeper and more\r\n\r\nserious issues which I have outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor Finance mentioned  sewerage projects and  the  increase  in\r\n\r\nwater rates. I feel that in certain respects he  is\r\n\r\nnot  correct, because I remember that last year  he\r\n\r\ninformed us that Singapore made a lot of money as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the revaluation of the German mark. Since\r\n\r\nwe  have  made  so much money, we should  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to pay for this additional expenditure and\r\n\r\nnot  ask the poor people in the rural areas who are\r\n\r\nnot  enjoying sewerage facilities to pay for  this.\r\n\r\nWe  must draw a line somewhere so that we are  fair\r\n\r\nto  all.  For instance, we can levy more  taxes  on\r\n\r\nliquor  or  increase the income tax rate  for  rich\r\n\r\npeople.  That  will be fairer. Or  perhaps  we  can\r\n\r\nincrease the tax on cigarettes and tobacco.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot fair to make the poor people pay more for their\r\n\r\nwater  consumption,  as  they  have  to  meet   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  incurred by their  children  on  their\r\n\r\nmaintenance,  food, clothing and  schooling.  I  am\r\n\r\nvoicing my opinion on behalf of these people and  I\r\n\r\nrequest   the  Minister  to  consider  this   point\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are told that the Government\r\n\r\nis  going  to  develop the sewerage  system  and  I\r\n\r\nassume  from the Minister's speech that  eventually\r\n\r\nit   will   be   on  an  island-wide  basis.   This\r\n\r\ndevelopment will cost the Government a few  million\r\n\r\ndollars. The money is borrowed from the World  Bank\r\n\r\nwith interest, and the people will be asked to  pay\r\n\r\nfor the cost of this development project. Singapore\r\n\r\nwill then be able to tell the world, \"Look, we have\r\n\r\nnot  only  high-rise flats but also a  very  modern\r\n\r\nwater-borne sewerage system.\" This is very well and\r\n\r\nlaudable.   The  Government  and  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore are proud of this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nobody will quarrel with the Government over\r\n\r\nthis  development project if we can afford it.  But\r\n\r\nthe point is this. This huge sum of money has to be\r\n\r\nrepaid with interest. I therefore would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Government why we cannot postpone this project\r\n\r\nuntil  we are in a position to carry it out without\r\n\r\nhaving  to  get  a loan from the World  Bank.  Sir,\r\n\r\nunless there is great urgency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  this  sewerage development  which  the  people\r\n\r\ncannot  do without, I sincerely urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  reconsider  this matter and  give  priority  to\r\n\r\nother  projects which merit it. Assuming that  this\r\n\r\nproject is very important and the Government cannot\r\n\r\ndo  without it, why cannot the cost be met by other\r\n\r\nforms of taxes? Though the increase of 20 cents for\r\n\r\n1,000  gallons of water is insignificant, it  still\r\n\r\naffects   the  lower-income  group  who  form   the\r\n\r\nmajority  of our community. I believe,  Sir,  there\r\n\r\nare  a  thousand and one ways of raising taxes  for\r\n\r\nthis  sewerage development, as the Member  for  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan has said, and the Government should lay  its\r\n\r\nhands upon them instead of choosing to finance this\r\n\r\nsewerage  project by increasing water charges.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the Government can easily increase  taxes\r\n\r\non    entertainment,   petrol,   liquor,   tobacco,\r\n\r\ncosmetics,  night-clubs and admission rate  to  the\r\n\r\nTurf Club. Last but not least, the Minister for Law\r\n\r\nand  National  Development can negotiate  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health to increase the abortion fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to raise is the\r\n\r\ndiscrepancy  involved  in  the  rates  charged  for\r\n\r\nwater.  The  rate charged for domestic  consumption\r\n\r\nhas always been lower than that for commercial use.\r\n\r\nSince  the commercial rate is increased by 50 cents\r\n\r\nper  1,000  gallons, the domestic  rate  should  be\r\n\r\nlower  than  20 cents because the businessmen  will\r\n\r\npass   the  increase  to  the  consumers.  So   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  not adopt  the  attitude  of  a\r\n\r\nperson  who pretends that he is healthy and  chubby\r\n\r\nby  slapping  his  own  face,  making  it  red  and\r\n\r\nswollen,  and showing it to the people and  saying.\r\n\r\n\"Look,  I  am healthy,\" when, in fact, he  is  not.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  we  cannot  afford  the   cost   of\r\n\r\nfinancing this project, we should postpone it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, once the principle is accepted\r\n\r\nthat we pay our way, and I think Singapore accepted\r\n\r\nit  quite  some time ago, then it is  only  logical\r\n\r\nthat the maintenance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our  sewerage system has got to  be  put  on  a\r\n\r\nrational,   self-sustaining   and   self-developing\r\n\r\nbasis. Nobody is going to come here to give us some\r\n\r\nmoney  to clear our waste or to improve our  sewage\r\n\r\ndisposal system. We have just got to find the money\r\n\r\nourselves, whether we like it or not. The Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich  this Bill seeks to amend already empowers  a\r\n\r\ncharge  to  be made for water closets and  urinals.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  sought now is a charge on  fittings  that\r\n\r\ndischarge waste into the sewerage system and on the\r\n\r\nwater that is used to convey that waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, this is only a logical\r\n\r\nextension of the law, and the recoupment of cost of\r\n\r\nsewerage  development. Everybody in  Singapore  who\r\n\r\nlives  in a house connected to the sewerage  system\r\n\r\nknows that more water is flushed into it than  from\r\n\r\nonly the water closet or the urinal. The water from\r\n\r\nthe  bathroom,  the kitchen sink, etc, is  emptied\r\n\r\ninto the sewerage system. The amendment to the  law\r\n\r\nto  include a charge for sanitary fittings or other\r\n\r\nfittings  which  discharge waste is therefore  fair\r\n\r\nand  necessary. When levying such a charge,  it  is\r\n\r\nonly  logical  and  fair to take into  account  the\r\n\r\nwater   that  goes  into  the  sewers.  Hence   the\r\n\r\namendment Bill which seeks to impose a levy on  the\r\n\r\namount  of water used in houses which are connected\r\n\r\nto the sewerage system is again logical and fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps the most appropriate time here to\r\n\r\ntouch on a subject which is a critical problem, not\r\n\r\nonly  in Singapore, but also in many parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  Just because we do have an excellent system\r\n\r\nof  potable  water, we often take other things  for\r\n\r\ngranted.  We have but a small island, and  although\r\n\r\nour  birth-rate is slowing down, our population  is\r\n\r\ngrowing.  As  more and more land  is  required  for\r\n\r\nhuman  habitation, less and less land is  available\r\n\r\nfor   catchments  and  reservoirs.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  getting enough potable  water  becomes\r\n\r\nmore acute. Costs have gone up and will continue to\r\n\r\ngo  up.  This is inevitable with population  growth\r\n\r\nand  economic development. If our only  problem  is\r\n\r\nrising,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncosts, we should consider ourselves fortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there are two huge pipes carrying\r\n\r\nenormous amounts of water to us every day, if  one\r\n\r\nof  these pipes, let alone two, were for one reason\r\n\r\nor  another  to be unavailable, we would  be  in  a\r\n\r\nrather  difficult position. We have, therefore,  to\r\n\r\nthink in terms of developing a larger capacity  for\r\n\r\ndomestic water resources. This will, of course,  be\r\n\r\ncostly,  but unless we intend to go without  water,\r\n\r\nwe  have no alternative but to spend the huge  sums\r\n\r\nnecessary for water works of one kind or another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to do this, Sir, we should have a\r\n\r\nrational basis to apportion the charges for use  of\r\n\r\nwater.  I support this Bill because it provides  us\r\n\r\nwith that rational basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill\r\n\r\nand the proposed increase in water rates, as it  is\r\n\r\nclear  that  the  proposed increase  is  not  being\r\n\r\nresorted  to as an easy way to raise more  revenue,\r\n\r\nnor   is  it  an  action  aimed  at  rectifying   a\r\n\r\ndepartmental  financial deficit  brought  about  by\r\n\r\nmaladministration. I feel that the increase  should\r\n\r\nbe   viewed  in  the  wider  context  of  the  vast\r\n\r\nexpansion  programme being undertaken by the  Water\r\n\r\nDepartment  with a view to ensuring that  the  high\r\n\r\nstandard  of  service  hitherto  attained  can   be\r\n\r\nmaintained  in  the  long run. Over  the  last  ten\r\n\r\nyears, our consumption of water has gone up by some\r\n\r\n50  per  cent.  This  is a good indication  of  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  affluence of our society. With  greater\r\n\r\neconomic growth almost guaranteed, coupled with the\r\n\r\ninevitable population growth, the increase  in  the\r\n\r\nconsumption  of water will, I feel  sure,  be  even\r\n\r\nmore dramatic in the next decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a responsible government, it is our duty to\r\n\r\nsee  that we can, and will, in the next five or ten\r\n\r\nyears,  continue  to  be  able  to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nsubstantially increased demand for water. To ensure\r\n\r\nthis  for the future, we are now being called  upon\r\n\r\nto pay a very small\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprice  in the form of a proposed increase in  water\r\n\r\nrates.  An average household, I understand, uses  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  between 10,000 and 12,000  gallons  of\r\n\r\nwater  a month. In terms of dollars and cents,  the\r\n\r\nmonthly outlay of a family works out to between  $8\r\n\r\nand  $10. The proposed increase will raise this  to\r\n\r\nbetween  $10 and $12 respectively. The  difference\r\n\r\nis  quite  insignificant indeed when one  bears  in\r\n\r\nmind  how  precious water is. However,  there  will\r\n\r\nalways  be  grumbling  among  some  people  at  the\r\n\r\nslightest  suggestion of an increase in  the  price\r\n\r\nthey  have  to pay for any type of public  service,\r\n\r\nbut  they may do well to make a few comparisons  to\r\n\r\nascertain  for  themselves what  better  things  or\r\n\r\nservices  they can purchase with $10 or $12  spread\r\n\r\nover a period of one month. Take an average smoker.\r\n\r\nHe  spends ungrudgingly between $10 and $30 or even\r\n\r\nmore  per month on cigarettes. The Member for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  has  just  told me that he spends  something\r\n\r\nlike $100 per month on cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be argued that cigarettes give greater\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  than water. But can  anyone  honestly\r\n\r\nsay that he can live without water? I can think  of\r\n\r\nmany  more  contradictions reflecting the illogical\r\n\r\ntraditional attitude of some of our consumers,  but\r\n\r\nI think I have made my point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me congratulate\r\n\r\nyou on your election as Speaker of this House. This\r\n\r\nis  an  opportune moment for congratulation as,  on\r\n\r\nthe  eve  of Chinese New Year, many people will  be\r\n\r\nwishing  one  another \"Happy  New  Year\".  Let  me,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  wish you a very happy term  of  office,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker.  Because the Minister in  charge  has\r\n\r\nintroduced  this  amendment  Bill  which  seeks  to\r\n\r\nimpose  a  levy  on sanitary fittings  and  on  the\r\n\r\nvolume  of  sewage and trade waste  discharge,  the\r\n\r\npeople's festive spirit has been dampened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the speeches made by the two Ministers, we\r\n\r\ncan   understand  clearly  the  reasons  for   this\r\n\r\nincreased taxation. It is mainly because the  World\r\n\r\nBank  has  loaned us $18 million for the expansion\r\n\r\nof  our sewerage scheme, on condition that the loan\r\n\r\nshould  help  finance  only  the  foreign  exchange\r\n\r\ncomponent  of the sewerage project, and  also  that\r\n\r\nthe  revenue  earned  on  the  project  should   be\r\n\r\nadequate  to cover operating expenses.  Also,  from\r\n\r\nthe  long-term point of view, it is clear that  our\r\n\r\nwater  supply  will be insufficient. Therefore,  in\r\n\r\nthe  coming  years we will have to build  two  more\r\n\r\nreservoirs. We have built reservoirs in  the  past,\r\n\r\nbut  we will need to build two more reservoirs - one\r\n\r\nin  Kranji and the other in Ulu Pandan - in future.\r\n\r\nBut  the explanation given for the increased  water\r\n\r\ncharges  is not justifiable. I, of course,  realise\r\n\r\nthe  large  sums of money involved in the expansion\r\n\r\nof  sewerage services. This project will enable the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to increase its revenue. The Government\r\n\r\nwill,  therefore, have to invest in something  that\r\n\r\nwill give us security, so that our economy will  he\r\n\r\nviable.  Undoubtedly, for the sake of our long-term\r\n\r\ninterest and for the ensurance of our future  water\r\n\r\nsupply,  the  Government has to  implement  various\r\n\r\nschemes   to  achieve  this  objective,   including\r\n\r\nlegislation against waste of pipe-water. I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  our  people  will understand the  justifiable\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, the important question\r\n\r\nis   whether  the  Government  has  considered  the\r\n\r\nconsequences  of  the increased water  charges.  We\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  about 70 to 80 per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\npeople belong to the lower income group, and  their\r\n\r\nmonthly  income  averages between  $150  and  $300.\r\n\r\nNormally  even  those with bigger  monthly  incomes\r\n\r\nthan  this do not find it easy to maintain a family\r\n\r\nwith  a few mouths to feed. For instance, just  now\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Paya Lebar said that some  people,\r\n\r\nlike himself, spend $100 a month on cigarettes. You\r\n\r\ncan thus see that this increased charge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  make  the burden on the poor people  heavier.\r\n\r\nFor  those people who are now in receipt of  public\r\n\r\nassistance,  they have not only to  maintain  their\r\n\r\nfamily with this assistance, but also to meet other\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  This additional charge, as  proposed,\r\n\r\nwill   therefore  aggravate  their  problem.  Small\r\n\r\ntraders,  hawkers,  and small coffee  stall-holders\r\n\r\nalso belong to the low income group, and I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister will give sympathetic consideration to all\r\n\r\nthese  poor  people  and  exempt  them  from   this\r\n\r\nadditional tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those in the higher income group, I agree to\r\n\r\nthe  imposition  of the increased charge  on  them,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are  getting fat salaries.  Even  an\r\n\r\nadditional  charge  of $50 or  $100  will  have  no\r\n\r\neffect on them, as it is within their means to pay.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, our Government, being democratic\r\n\r\nand  socialist, needs to look after the welfare and\r\n\r\ninterest  of  our people. In view  of  our  ideals,\r\n\r\nnamely,  to  tax  those who are able  to  bear  the\r\n\r\nadditional  burden of tariff, and to  exempt  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  not able to bear it, I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  reconsider imposing this proposed tariff,  so\r\n\r\nthat  all  the people will support the Government's\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like all human beings, we\r\n\r\nresist paying increased charges. But luckily we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have an abundant supply of clean  water,\r\n\r\nand  because of this, we lack appreciation of  this\r\n\r\nprecious commodity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to give the Government\r\n\r\nauthority  to levy increased charges on  water  for\r\n\r\nthe  financing  of  the sewerage system.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nafter  listening  to  the  speeches  of  both   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law and National Development  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, I would say that the  sooner\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore realise that water is still\r\n\r\nrelatively   cheap,  the  better  for   them.   The\r\n\r\nimposition  of  the additional 20 cents  per  1,000\r\n\r\ngallons  for domestic consumption and 50 cents  per\r\n\r\n1,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngallons  for  commercial consumption  is  only  the\r\n\r\nbeginning, because without the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nhaving to tell us about it, I think it is already a\r\n\r\nwell-known fact that the water charges will have to\r\n\r\nbe further increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, we want to extend and improve our\r\n\r\nsewerage    system.   With   its   extension    and\r\n\r\nimprovement, more water will be needed. Since  this\r\n\r\nis so, it goes without saying that we have to build\r\n\r\nmore   reservoirs,  which  means  that   additional\r\n\r\ncapital expenditure is required. In fact, when this\r\n\r\nBill  was introduced, I thought to myself that this\r\n\r\nadditional  charge  would  be  acceptable  to   the\r\n\r\npeople, because it is no longer economic to  supply\r\n\r\nwater  at  80 cents per 1,000 gallons for  domestic\r\n\r\nconsumption.  As  has already  been  indicated,  it\r\n\r\ncosts over 80 cents to produce 1,000 gallons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we think over this point soberly, it is\r\n\r\nunlikely  that the increase in the water rate  will\r\n\r\ncause  hardship even to the lower income  group.  I\r\n\r\nwould  say  there  would be more hardship  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  if  we  were to carry on as  before  at  an\r\n\r\nuneconomic rate, and if we do not find the finances\r\n\r\nto  run an adequate and efficient water system  and\r\n\r\nwe  let it slide back to the point where we are not\r\n\r\nsure whether our taps are going to give us adequate\r\n\r\nwater  for  bathing and cooking. On that  basis,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it is might and proper to impose this little\r\n\r\nadditional  increase in charges now to ensure  that\r\n\r\nwe  continue  to enjoy an efficient  water  system,\r\n\r\nadequate for our people now and in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have taken more time than\r\n\r\nanticipated, but it goes to show the great interest\r\n\r\nMembers of this House have in matters which  affect\r\n\r\ntheir constituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have expressed grave concern for\r\n\r\nthe  poorer  section of our community. Though  they\r\n\r\nhave  given  their blessing to this proposal,  they\r\n\r\nhave criticised it on the ground that this is a tax\r\n\r\non the poor, and that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  should  be taxing the rich. But let me  correct\r\n\r\nany  misapprehensions on this  matter.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance  who  deals  with  financial\r\n\r\nmatters, and he has given his explanation. But  let\r\n\r\nme  reiterate that this new tax will only  mean  an\r\n\r\nextra  $1 per month for the poorer section  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind Members again that in respect of\r\n\r\nthe  tax on Public Utilities Board bills, there  is\r\n\r\nan  exemption for the poorer section -  no  tax  is\r\n\r\npayable if the P.U.B. bill does not exceed $10.  As\r\n\r\na  result  of  the imposition of this  extra  $1  a\r\n\r\nmonth, certain P.U.B. bills will go up. In order to\r\n\r\nspare the consumer who previously paid $10 and will\r\n\r\nhave  to pay a little more now from having  to  pay\r\n\r\nanother  tax on his bill, the exemption of  tax  on\r\n\r\nbills   has  been  increased  from  $10   to   $15.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the Government is as concerned  as  all\r\n\r\nMembers  are  with  the  poorer  section   of   our\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also correct one other misapprehension.\r\n\r\nSome  Members  say that this new measure  will  hit\r\n\r\npeople  in  the rural areas, as it is in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  that  the poorer people live. I disagree.  I\r\n\r\nthink  there  are  more poor people  in  the  urban\r\n\r\nareas, especially in the middle of Chinatown,  than\r\n\r\nthere  are in Sembawang, Punggol and Jurong.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  saying that the farmers live on the fat of the\r\n\r\nland,  but  they are better off than the people  in\r\n\r\nmany  sections of Chinatown, for instance.  And  in\r\n\r\ncase  Members  think  that the  Government  is  not\r\n\r\nlooking  after the poor people, who do  they  think\r\n\r\nare  living in the Housing Board flats? One-quarter\r\n\r\nof  our population are housed in flats built by the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board. These one-room, two-room,  three-room and four-room flats are  occupied\r\n\r\nby the poorer sections of the community. The richer\r\n\r\npeople  do not qualify to live in these flats.  And\r\n\r\nlet  me  remind Members again that all these  flats\r\n\r\nare  served by modern sanitation. So the imposition\r\n\r\nof this tax is not as unjust as they think it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst dealing with the financial and economic\r\n\r\naspects of the proposed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures,  the  Minister for Finance  gave  Members\r\n\r\ndetails  of  the  proposed water  projects  on  the\r\n\r\nisland. I need not add to that except that  I  must\r\n\r\nremind  Members  again that the last  time  we  had\r\n\r\nwater  rationing in Singapore was  in  1963.  Since\r\n\r\nthen we have been all right. At that time Singapore\r\n\r\nconsumed 60 million gallons of water per day. Today\r\n\r\nSingapore consumes more than 100 million gallons of\r\n\r\nwater per day. This is a 40 per cent increase in  a\r\n\r\nperiod of six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take Members back to modern sanitation. In\r\n\r\nthe  year 1949 the population was one million  with\r\n\r\none-quarter  of them served with modern sanitation.\r\n\r\nTwenty  years  have gone by. In the year  1969  the\r\n\r\npopulation was two million. Half the population was\r\n\r\nserved  by  modern sanitation. I have informed  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Bukit Panjang, in answer to one of  his\r\n\r\nquestions,  that it is the long-term  objective  of\r\n\r\nthe   Government   to  provide  modern   sanitation\r\n\r\nthroughout  the island. I do not think  any  Member\r\n\r\nhere  will  disagree with me that this  is  a  good\r\n\r\nobjective. But when we can reach this objective  is\r\n\r\nnot  certain  in the sense that I cannot  name  the\r\n\r\nyear, that is, whether it will be in early 1970  or\r\n\r\nlate  1970, as the Member for Punggol wants  me  to\r\n\r\nsay.  All  I can say is that, looking at  our  past\r\n\r\nrecords, perhaps in 15 years' time we might be able\r\n\r\nto  serve 95 per cent of our population with modern\r\n\r\nsanitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked just now what projects we\r\n\r\nhave  for modern sanitation. Members will know that\r\n\r\nwe have two main sewage disposal plants, one at Kim\r\n\r\nChuan  Road  in  Paya  Lebar,  which  is  near  the\r\n\r\nAirport, and the other in Ulu Pandan. We propose to\r\n\r\nbuild two more sewage disposal plants, one at  Kaki\r\n\r\nBukit  to  serve  the  areas in  the  vicinity  and\r\n\r\nextending  to  Changi, and the other in  Jurong  to\r\n\r\nserve that vicinity and, in particular, the rapidly\r\n\r\nexpanding industrial estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has asked, why should\r\n\r\nwe have modern\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsanitation  when we cannot afford it  and  have  to\r\n\r\nborrow  money  and pay interest on it?

Eight  million\r\n\r\ngallons  of  water a day are lost in  distribution.\r\n\r\nSixty  per  cent  of  the domestic  consumption  or\r\n\r\napproximately 25 million gallons a day go down  the\r\n\r\nsewers. This is the domestic user. Twenty per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the water consumed by industrial and commercial\r\n\r\nusers and Government and Statutory Board users,  or\r\n\r\napproximately 10 million gallons of water, go  down\r\n\r\nthe  sewers  that way. So in all, out  of  the  100\r\n\r\nmillion  gallons  of water we use daily,  about  35\r\n\r\nmillion  gallons of water go down the sewers.  This\r\n\r\nis not a negligible amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, may I just say\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister for Finance made a  Ministerial\r\n\r\nstatement last December explaining this proposal.
