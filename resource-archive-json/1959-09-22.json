The\r\n\r\nresult  has  been  that a considerable  number  of\r\n\r\nproperty  owners have benefited over a  period  of\r\n\r\nyears  from the undervaluation of their properties\r\n\r\nwhile   others  less  fortunate  have  had   their\r\n\r\nproperties valued correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the correct valuation taken by the City\r\n\r\nCouncil   since  the  new  Government  came   into\r\n\r\nexistence,  many  millions of dollars  of  revenue\r\n\r\nwhich  were lost hitherto have been recovered  and\r\n\r\nwhich  can  be used for the benefit  of  the  poor\r\n\r\nclasses  in  erecting  more standpipes,  providing\r\n\r\nmore    electricity,   constructing   parks    and\r\n\r\nplaygrounds,   kampong  roads   and   many   other\r\n\r\namenities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revaluation of properties has been done in\r\n\r\ncertain  areas which we believe have  many  vested\r\n\r\ninterests connected with the City Council  in  the\r\n\r\npast  ten  years and there were many  areas  where\r\n\r\nmany  properties were not valued properly. At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, in our revaluation of such properties,\r\n\r\nthe  Assessment Department also touched  on  rent-controlled  houses in which certain  anomalies  in\r\n\r\nthe payment of assessment had been created due  to\r\n\r\nrent  control.  Because of the existence  of  rent\r\n\r\ncontrol,  there  are  some  people,  mostly  chief\r\n\r\ntenants, who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  now  reaping  rich profits  from  such  rent-controlled houses. We think it is high  time  that\r\n\r\nthe  chief tenants of these houses should be  made\r\n\r\nto  bear  a  part  of the cost of maintaining  the\r\n\r\nessential  services and providing better amenities\r\n\r\nto   the  poor.  The  revaluation  for  assessment\r\n\r\npurposes  of rent-controlled houses has been  done\r\n\r\nin some States of the Federation of Malaya. During\r\n\r\nthe  past few weeks, after the valuation list  has\r\n\r\nbeen  published, we found out that some  landlords\r\n\r\nand  chief  tenants tried to exploit the situation\r\n\r\nby  threatening  to  increase the  rents  of  sub-tenants who are mainly the poor people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am quite aware, as is pointed out in the question tabled by the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark,  that  rent-controlled  premises  are  in  a\r\n\r\nspecial position in that the annual value must  be\r\n\r\nassessed on the basis of the rents permitted to be\r\n\r\ncharged  under the Control of Rent Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\nspecial  position of rent-controlled  premises  is\r\n\r\nreceiving consideration by the Government  and  an\r\n\r\nannouncement  will be made as soon as  a  decision\r\n\r\nhas  been  made on the appropriate  action  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken with regard to these premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Does the Minister then accept the\r\n\r\nposition that the proposed increase in so  far  as\r\n\r\nrent-controlled   properties  are   concerned   is\r\n\r\nillegal?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I have said just\r\n\r\nnow  that  the special position of rent-controlled\r\n\r\npremises   is  receiving  consideration   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and I repeat that an announcement  will\r\n\r\nbe  made as soon as a decision has been reached on\r\n\r\nthe appropriate action to be taken with regard  to\r\n\r\nthese premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Local Government Ordinance, the\r\n\r\nvaluation list is published each year before  31st\r\n\r\nAugust.

This was in keeping with\r\n\r\nprevious  departmental  procedure  based  on   the\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Ordinance. The City Council  assessment\r\n\r\nofficers   were   suspicious   of   their   former\r\n\r\ncolleague, who is now an estate agent, and who  in\r\n\r\n1958 whilst in the employ of the City Council  had\r\n\r\nused  City  Council information for a  High  Court\r\n\r\nbank assessment case, that is the famous Chartered\r\n\r\nBank case, and appeared as a witness on behalf  of\r\n\r\nhis  clients while he was still in the service  of\r\n\r\nthe City Council. Because of his past conduct, the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  Assessment Department  refused  him\r\n\r\naccess to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1960 valuation list until he could produce letters\r\n\r\nof  authority from the particular property  owners\r\n\r\nwho   would  be  his  clients  to  look  into  the\r\n\r\nassessments   of   their  particular   properties.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  Mr Speaker, the Local  Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance promulgated in 1957 was not clear on the\r\n\r\nmatter  as  to  whether any member of  the  public\r\n\r\ncould  go  to  the City Council and  look  at  the\r\n\r\nvaluation list of all property owners with whom he\r\n\r\nhas  no  connection whatsoever. Mr  Speaker,  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Ordinance on which the Local Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1957,  was based  did  not  allow  any\r\n\r\nmember  of the public to look at the valuation  of\r\n\r\nany  property  unless  he  has  got  a  letter  of\r\n\r\nauthority.  It is based on the same  principle  as\r\n\r\nthe  Income  Tax  Department in not  allowing  any\r\n\r\naccountant or lawyer to have access to the  Income\r\n\r\nTax  Department's  assessment list  of  taxpayers.\r\n\r\nThis precaution will restrict unscrupulous persons\r\n\r\nfrom  touting for business by looking  into  other\r\n\r\npeople's  assessments where  there  will  be  many\r\n\r\nchances of corruption, particularly in the case of\r\n\r\npersons  who have previously been engaged  by  the\r\n\r\nAssessment   Department   or   the   Income    Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the matter was brought up to the High Court and we found that the Local Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance   is   different  from   the   Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance on this matter and allowed access to the\r\n\r\nvaluation list to any person even though he has no\r\n\r\nconnection.

There have been built a number\r\n\r\nof new cinema theatres during\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  period,  and  it  has been  found  that  the\r\n\r\npresent  rates  of entertainments duty  cannot  be\r\n\r\nincreased without the burden being passed  to  the\r\n\r\npatrons. The local exhibitors who have to  bear  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  expenses  would  pass  any  additional\r\n\r\ntaxation  on  the cinema industry to the  patrons,\r\n\r\nunless  legislation  were passed  to  control  the\r\n\r\nadmission  prices.  On the  one  hand,  the  local\r\n\r\ndistributors who have a share in the  profits  are\r\n\r\nsubject   to   income  tax.   But   the   overseas\r\n\r\ndistributors  who obtain greater profits  are  not\r\n\r\nsubject  to  local  taxation.  Large  amounts   of\r\n\r\nroyalty are therefore being remitted overseas, tax\r\n\r\nfree,   as   they  are  not  within  the  charging\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Income Tax Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it has been found that the greater\r\n\r\nthe  amount paid by the local distributors to  the\r\n\r\noverseas  producers, the smaller is the chargeable\r\n\r\nprofit  of the local distributors here,  as  these\r\n\r\nroyalties are deducted from receipts to arrive  at\r\n\r\nincome.  As  the local distributors  are,  in  the\r\n\r\nmain, subsidiaries of the overseas producers, they\r\n\r\ncan  conveniently so arrange their  business  that\r\n\r\nthe  local distributors pay little income tax, and\r\n\r\nthe  great bulk of their gross income receipts are\r\n\r\npaid  and remitted overseas without being  subject\r\n\r\nto local taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the law is such that the royalty\r\n\r\nreceived  by the producer is not subject  to  tax,\r\n\r\nsince  he  is  non-resident,  and  the  income  is\r\n\r\nderived outside Singapore and therefore not income\r\n\r\nchargeable  within  the scope of  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is usual that agreements are made outside the\r\n\r\ncountry and payments effected outside, 50 that  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not suffer from local taxation. This exempts\r\n\r\npayment  of tax on royalties received by producers\r\n\r\nresident  overseas and in addition in  respect  of\r\n\r\nproducers  resident  in the  United  Kingdom.  The\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom/Singapore Double Taxation Agreement\r\n\r\nexempts  royalties from income tax when  they  are\r\n\r\nreceived  by  producers  resident  in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom from Singapore. It is considered desirable\r\n\r\nthat  some measures be taken to extract a due from\r\n\r\nthese  overseas producers, and this  objective  is\r\n\r\nwhat the proposed Bill intends to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is based on similar legislation in force in\r\n\r\nNew Zealand since the 1930's. The main contents of\r\n\r\nthis   Bill   are  indicated  in  the  Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement.  But there are some main provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe Bill which should be mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 4, it is proposed to levy with effect\r\n\r\nfrom today a film hire duty in respect of proceeds\r\n\r\nwhich  are  derived  from the renting  of  foreign\r\n\r\nfilms.  It  is not the intention of Government  to\r\n\r\nimpose   this  tax  on  films  which  are  locally\r\n\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Renter\" and \"rent\" are defined in clause 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This duty is not allowed for deduction under\r\n\r\nsubclause  (8) of clause 4 for purposes of  income\r\n\r\ntax on account of loss in revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renters of these films will be required to be\r\n\r\nregistered under clause 5, and to keep records  as\r\n\r\nspecified in clause 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are liable to pay duty at the rate of one-quarter of 60 per cent of such gross receipts as\r\n\r\nlaid out in clause 9. It may be suggested why one-quarter  of  60  per  cent is used  instead  of  a\r\n\r\nstraight  15  per cent. Perhaps this ought  to  be\r\n\r\nexplained. Film hire duty is in nature  a  customs\r\n\r\nduty,  and therefore the country of origin of  the\r\n\r\ncontract  has  no  bearing on  the  liability.  In\r\n\r\nstrict theory, it should be levied on the value of\r\n\r\nthe  film  imported.  It is virtually  impossible,\r\n\r\nhowever,  to ascertain the value of films  at  the\r\n\r\npoint  of  entry by ordinary methods of valuation,\r\n\r\nsuch  as actual cost, occurrent domestic value  in\r\n\r\nthe  country of origin, and so on. The  imposition\r\n\r\nof  a  film  hire  duty  seeks  to  overcome  this\r\n\r\ndifficulty  of  valuation  by  making  the   gross\r\n\r\nrentals   derived,  the  determining  factor   for\r\n\r\nvaluation. How gross receipts from rentals  should\r\n\r\nbe  calculated  is  set out  in  clause  10.  From\r\n\r\nexperience  elsewhere, it has been found  that  40\r\n\r\nper   cent   of  such  gross  receipts  would   be\r\n\r\nconsidered  quite an adequate allowance  to  cover\r\n\r\nexpenses   and  for  profit.  It  is,   therefore,\r\n\r\nconsidered that the levy should be imposed on  the\r\n\r\nbalance of 60 per cent. In other words, for  every\r\n\r\n$1  that a non-resident producer takes out of this\r\n\r\ncountry, he is charged 15 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I would like to say here that this\r\n\r\nquantum  can  be  adjusted in  the  light  of  our\r\n\r\nexperience. One-quarter is an elastic quantity and\r\n\r\naccording to subsequent events and experience,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, we shall adjust it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 11 there is provision whereby the\r\n\r\nMinister may grant exemption in respect of all  or\r\n\r\nany of the provisions of the Ordinance. The reason\r\n\r\nfor  this clause is this: for example, if  a  film\r\n\r\nsociety or a body or any other association  wishes\r\n\r\nto  exhibit  a film, we would wish to  exempt  him\r\n\r\nfrom  the  tax defined in this Bill, and therefore\r\n\r\ndiscretion is left to the Minister to so exempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the purpose of Government to go at the\r\n\r\nsmall fry. We consider that tax should be borne by\r\n\r\nthose  who  can  bear it, and in  this  particular\r\n\r\ninstance,  taxation is imposed  upon  non-resident\r\n\r\nproducers,  those  who  make  the  money  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  escape from income tax by  devious  ways.\r\n\r\nNow  it is natural that we would expect that  when\r\n\r\nthis film tax is imposed, the renter would try  to\r\n\r\npass  it on to the cinema-going patrons. This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  forestalled by a clause here which says that\r\n\r\nthe existing admission charges cannot be increased\r\n\r\nwithout the approval of the Minister. This  clause\r\n\r\nis  in  clause 13. In other words, when this  Bill\r\n\r\ncomes into force, there should not be any increase\r\n\r\nin  cinema  charges, which, as it is, are  already\r\n\r\nhigh.   There   are  other  clauses   which   make\r\n\r\nprovisions  for  an  effective collection  of  the\r\n\r\nduty.  We  do  not  pretend  that  this  Bill   is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  perfect. Someone may  find  loopholes.\r\n\r\nBut  when we discover that someone has used  these\r\n\r\nloopholes, we shall plug them quite quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate that in a year, the Government should\r\n\r\nbe  able  to collect $1 million revenue from  this\r\n\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  venture to hazard the guess that this  Bill  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  set  a record. From the moment  it  was\r\n\r\nconceived  to  the time it is put on  the  statute\r\n\r\nbook,  the time taken is probably the shortest  in\r\n\r\nthe history of legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are interested in collecting  as  much\r\n\r\nrevenue  as  possible, and if what the  Government\r\n\r\nare  saying  is correct - that certain non-residents\r\n\r\nare escaping the payment of income tax because  of\r\n\r\nsome  loopholes  in the Income Tax  Ordinance - then\r\n\r\nsuch  people should be made to pay the tax because\r\n\r\nthe profits are earned in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I had hoped that when the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister was asked by you,  \"Second\r\n\r\nReading when?\", he would at least have given us  a\r\n\r\ncouple  of hours in which to study this Bill,  but\r\n\r\ninstead  of which the answer was, \"At the  end  of\r\n\r\nitem 5\", which meant no time at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the intention of Government in doing this is\r\n\r\nto prevent the Opposition from raising any queries\r\n\r\non  it, then they have certainly succeeded. But  I\r\n\r\nmust  protest,  Mr Speaker, Sir, at  the  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich this legislation is being pushed through  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly. The Press had been  informed  some\r\n\r\ntime  back  that  legislation  was  going  to   be\r\n\r\nintroduced. I would suggest, with respect  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  power, that the least  they  could\r\n\r\nhave  done would have been to take the Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly into their confidence and let  them\r\n\r\nhave  this  Bill for some time in order that  they\r\n\r\nmight study it and express any views, if they  had\r\n\r\nany,  or  support the Bill, as the  case  may  be.\r\n\r\nInstead  of  which, even the normal practice  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  Bills introduced on a  Certificate  of\r\n\r\nUrgency  has not been followed, Mr Speaker,  Sir;\r\n\r\nand that is, through your courtesy in such matters\r\n\r\nyou  send us a cyclostyled copy, and we have  time\r\n\r\nat  least to go through it hurriedly, and put  out\r\n\r\nany   views  which  we  think  would  assist   the\r\n\r\nGovernment in the consideration of the  Bill.  But\r\n\r\napparently the point and purpose of this procedure\r\n\r\nnow  being followed by the Government is to muzzle\r\n\r\neverybody, even the Opposition - a point which I  do\r\n\r\nnot  appreciate. If the sole purpose of this  Bill\r\n\r\nis to bring into the income tax net those who have\r\n\r\nbeen  escaping  it  by some subterfuge,  then  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  would  certainly  have  supported  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Where then is the necessity  to  keep\r\n\r\nthe Bill away from the Opposition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers?

As I was saying,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  the cinema business is flourishing.\r\n\r\nThat  we cannot deny.

You see cinema theatres popping up in all\r\n\r\ncorners  of  the  island, and  from  that  we  can\r\n\r\nconclude  that the number of people who are  going\r\n\r\nto  the cinemas is increasing. In fact, Sir, I can\r\n\r\ngive  you  figures to prove this. For example,  in\r\n\r\n1957   alone,  the  total  number  of  full-length\r\n\r\nfeature  films  imported  into  this  country  and\r\n\r\npassed for public exhibition numbered 858. Besides\r\n\r\nthese full-length feature films, there was a total\r\n\r\nnumber  of 440 shorts. The total footage  censored\r\n\r\ncame  to  9\u00bd million feet. So the population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore had quite an eyeful of films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the major source of entertainment\r\n\r\nis  the  cinema. Why that is so I do not wish,  at\r\n\r\nthis  place  or  at  this time,  to  go  into  the\r\n\r\nreasons.  But  it is a fact that it is  the  major\r\n\r\nsource   of   entertainment,  and   therefore   it\r\n\r\ncontributes considerably to the prosperity of  all\r\n\r\nthose  involved  in the cinema industry.  Now,  in\r\n\r\nsimple  words,  what I would like  to  inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse  is this. The reason for this Bill is  that,\r\n\r\nfor example, agreements made between the Paramount\r\n\r\nFilms  of  Malaya Incorporated and  the  Paramount\r\n\r\nInternational Films Incorporated are entered  into\r\n\r\nin the United States of America. It is agreed that\r\n\r\nthe  delivery of all negative and master  positive\r\n\r\nprints is to be made in the City of New York,  and\r\n\r\npayments under the agreement are to be made at the\r\n\r\noffice   of  the  Paramount  International   Films\r\n\r\nincorporated in New York City in the lawful  money\r\n\r\nof the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is obvious that in drawing up these\r\n\r\nagreements,  action is taken to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nincome  therefrom  cannot be said  to  be  derived\r\n\r\nanywhere but in the United States of America. That\r\n\r\nbeing  so,  therefore, any profits made  from  the\r\n\r\nrenting of films to exhibitors in Singapore do not\r\n\r\ncome  within  the  scope of the local  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  However,  in  bringing  forward   this\r\n\r\nexample, I do not wish to make it appear that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  making any discrimination  against\r\n\r\nfilms of any particular country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House that in 1957\r\n\r\nalone,  there  were  imported 55  films  from  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, 323\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfilms from the United States of America, 277  from\r\n\r\nHongkong,  125  from  India  and  78  from   other\r\n\r\ncountries. This tax applies equitably to all films\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  the country of origin.  Being  a\r\n\r\nsignatory to G.A.T.T., we are not in a position to\r\n\r\noffer preferential treatment to films made in  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom. At the same time, this tax being a\r\n\r\nnew  one,  we do not conflict with the Ottawa  and\r\n\r\nGeneva agreements on imperial preference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this Bill, I wish to point out\r\n\r\nthat  it  is not our intention to stifle the  film\r\n\r\nindustry.  But it is also necessary  that  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of our people we should extract  our  due\r\n\r\nfrom all those who make money in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I intend, for the benefit of hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  on the Opposition benches, to go  through\r\n\r\nthis  Bill as slowly as I can and pause more  than\r\n\r\nusual at the important clauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 4 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it an amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No, Sir.
