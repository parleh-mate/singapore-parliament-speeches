The  demand for cement in the year  1971  is\r\n\r\nexpected to be in the region of about 850,000 tons,\r\n\r\naveraging  71,000 tons a month, or 2,400  tons  per\r\n\r\nday.

First  of\r\n\r\nall,  to  answer  the Member for Sembawang  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the $l0 vote. This signifies that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  staked  a claim  for  furniture  and\r\n\r\nequipment and for land. Of course, you cannot buy a\r\n\r\ntable these days for $10 unless it is a second hand\r\n\r\ntable.  But  the  $10 vote is to indicate  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture,  if  it is necessary for the University  to\r\n\r\nacquire equipment, a submission will be made to the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of land, nothing has been settled. I\r\n\r\nhave no idea at all how the University is going  to\r\n\r\npay for the acquisition of land at Kent Ridge. This\r\n\r\nis a problem which is beyond the University, and it\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  settled  between  the  Bases  Economic\r\n\r\nConversion  Department, representing the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment, and the British Services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, what has happened is this. We have\r\n\r\nsubmitted five papers providing the data which have\r\n\r\nbeen  asked  for by the World Bank. The World  Bank\r\n\r\nhas  sent officers periodically to discuss with the\r\n\r\nUniversity  Development Unit the progress  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing  made in planning. We are now waiting for  an\r\n\r\nappraisal team to come out from Washington so  that\r\n\r\nstudies can be further elaborated if necessary, and\r\n\r\nthe  World  Bank can make a final decision  on  how\r\n\r\nmuch of the application which we have made will  be\r\n\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of the sports complex\r\n\r\nwhich has been raised by the Member for Whampoa,  I\r\n\r\nwould  just like to point out that it is  very  far\r\n\r\ndistant in planning. We have no immediate plans for\r\n\r\nit, although the intention, of course, is to devote\r\n\r\na part\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the land to sports activities which will include\r\n\r\nfacilities for students and staff who wish to  play\r\n\r\nsoccer,  rugger, hockey, and cricket if  necessary.\r\n\r\nBut  we  have  to  make  optimum  use  of  existing\r\n\r\nfacilities. There is already in existence a  sports\r\n\r\ncomplex  about 300 yards north of Kent Ridge,  next\r\n\r\ndoor to the St. John's International School and the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic which will be sited at Dover Road. This\r\n\r\nsports  complex has been built at very heavy  cost.\r\n\r\nSeveral  claims  have  been  made  for  the  sports\r\n\r\ncomplex  which includes a swimming pool, a pavilion\r\n\r\nand  changing  rooms.  I believe  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs and the Ministry of  Education  are\r\n\r\nalso making a claim. But until a final decision has\r\n\r\nbeen  made, I cannot guarantee that we need to plan\r\n\r\nfor  another swimming pool, because I believe  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  facilities  are available  in  that  area\r\n\r\nshould   also  be  made  available  to  the   whole\r\n\r\ncommunity and not to the students only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for University staff housing, I am told that\r\n\r\nthere  are  existing,  as of this  moment  in  Kent\r\n\r\nRidge,  houses  which  are now  being  occupied  by\r\n\r\nofficers in the British Army. Of this number, about\r\n\r\n55  will have to be demolished in order to make way\r\n\r\nfor  Phase One of the development project. So there\r\n\r\nwill  be 45 houses left which can be used to  house\r\n\r\nthe  University  staff. There are  also  houses  in\r\n\r\nMedway and Sussex Parks which are adjacent to  Kent\r\n\r\nRidge.  Again I have made a bid for them on  behalf\r\n\r\nof  the University and the Polytechnic as well,  so\r\n\r\nthat  we can utilise them for teachers who wish  to\r\n\r\nteach at the University or the Polytechnic. But  no\r\n\r\nfinal  decision  can be made on the utilisation  of\r\n\r\nthese  houses  because,  excepting  those  at  Kent\r\n\r\nRidge,  real  estate problems  have  to  be  solved\r\n\r\nbetween  the Singapore Government and the  British,\r\n\r\nAustralian  and New Zealand Governments  which  are\r\n\r\nproposing  to  place a token force in Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  there  is at the moment an examination  of\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of this token force which  will  be  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But our intention is that,  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  locality  in  Pasir  Panjang  should  be  made\r\n\r\navailable for economic and educational development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, where possible and where land is\r\n\r\navailable,  it  will  be  the  intention   of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  to build flats for housing  its  staff,\r\n\r\nand   similarly  I  have  also  suggested  to   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic that when it moves over to Dover  Road,\r\n\r\nflats ought to be built to house its staff. In this\r\n\r\nway,  we  can bring the staff nearer to the campus.\r\n\r\nThese two problems are being looked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for air-conditioning, I am more concerned with\r\n\r\nthe annual maintenance costs and the public utility\r\n\r\ncharges which the University will have to pay, than\r\n\r\nwith the capital expenditure which will be incurred\r\n\r\nby  installing air-conditioning plants.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the annual operating cost of air-conditioning\r\n\r\nis $1.10 per square foot per annum. The Faculty for\r\n\r\nEngineering alone is asking for a total floor  area\r\n\r\nof  393,750 square feet. But of this area, a  total\r\n\r\nof  315,000  square feet is to be  air-conditioned,\r\n\r\nbecause   laboratories  which   contain   sensitive\r\n\r\nequipment will have to be air-conditioned and it is\r\n\r\nthe  intention to provide air-conditioned rooms  in\r\n\r\nthe  lecture  theatres as well as in seminar  rooms\r\n\r\nand  staff rooms. The annual operating cost of air-conditioning  this space alone for the  Engineering\r\n\r\nFaculty is $346,500. If you extrapolate the cost of\r\n\r\nmaintaining   air-conditioning   for   all    other\r\n\r\nfaculties   -   Science,   Architecture,   Business\r\n\r\nAdministration and ultimately the Teaching Hospital\r\n\r\n-  you  can  imagine how much the annual  recurrent\r\n\r\ncosts   of   upkeeping  the  University  will   be.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we have to be very careful that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot air-condition every part of the University. The\r\n\r\nworkshops and the corridors are decidedly not going\r\n\r\nto  be air-conditioned. The whole campus complex is\r\n\r\nbeing  planned  on a modular basis so  that,  where\r\n\r\nnecessary, air conditioning can be installed as and\r\n\r\nwhen members of the staff feel fit. And when it  is\r\n\r\nnot  necessary, the air-conditioning  can  also  be\r\n\r\nturned off. This is uppermost in our minds.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  just the capital expenditure which is required\r\n\r\nto put up the University at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKent  Ridge but the annual recurrent costs as well.\r\n\r\nI hope I have answered all the questions which have\r\n\r\nbeen  raised  by  the  Members  for  Sembawang  and\r\n\r\nWhampoa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the Minister's reply and I beg leave\r\n\r\nto withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,300,020 for Head 11 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 21 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 21 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I wish to raise a few\r\n\r\nquestions for answer by the Minister concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) How is this money to be spent?

As  stated\r\n\r\nearlier   in   the  debate  on  the  Estimates   of\r\n\r\nExpenditure  for the year 1971-72, we have  applied\r\n\r\nto  the  United  Nations Development Programme  for\r\n\r\nassistance  to  carry  out  a  mass  rapid  transit\r\n\r\nfeasibility study.

In\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper on the Reorganisation of the Motor\r\n\r\nTransport  Service  of Singapore  tabled  recently,\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  proposal to allow  authorised  motor\r\n\r\nworkshops and repair shops to issue certificates of\r\n\r\ninspection  to  vehicle  owners.  May  I  ask   the\r\n\r\nMinister when this can be implemented?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir, the House is being asked to allocate a sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney  totalling  $823,000  to  establish  a  Motor\r\n\r\nVehicle  Inspection Centre at Upper  Thomson  Road.\r\n\r\nLast  week this House heard the reply given by  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  that  the  new Motor Vehicle  Inspection\r\n\r\nCentre  would be completed at the end of 1971,  and\r\n\r\nthat  the R.O.V. headquarters would be moving  into\r\n\r\nits new building at Upper Thomson Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard recently that renovations are being\r\n\r\ncarried  out  at the R.O.V., Middle Road.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister a few questions. First, if\r\n\r\nthe  Registry of Vehicles is going to move  out  of\r\n\r\nMiddle Road, why are renovations being carried  out\r\n\r\nthere? Second, how much floor area is the new Motor\r\n\r\nVehicle Inspection Centre going to occupy, and what\r\n\r\nsort  of  a  building is it going to be?  The  last\r\n\r\nquestion is, how many cars can be inspected at this\r\n\r\nnew Inspection Centre?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may\r\n\r\nfirst answer the question raised by the Member  for\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh  referring to that section of the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  on the Reorganisation of the Motor Transport\r\n\r\nService of Singapore, Paper Cmd. 21 of 1970. It  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that  in  para. 12.2 of  the  Paper,  it  was\r\n\r\nindicated   that   it   is   proposed   to   accept\r\n\r\ncertificates  of  inspection issued  by  authorised\r\n\r\nmotor  workshops or repairers in lieu of inspection\r\n\r\nby  the ROV. We have not implemented this decision:\r\n\r\nit  is  not  kept in cold storage, but  just  being\r\n\r\ndeferred, because there are many problems now being\r\n\r\ntackled  by  the Registrar of Vehicles,  especially\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproposed re-routing and reallocation of bus  routes\r\n\r\nwhich will begin about two weeks from now and there\r\n\r\nis  a  tremendous amount of work involved. Once  we\r\n\r\nhave  got over the bus services reorganisation,  we\r\n\r\nwill  come  back again to this other  proposal,  by\r\n\r\nwhich  time we hope that the new Inspection  Centre\r\n\r\nwhich is being built at Sin Ming Road will be ready\r\n\r\nwithin  five  months from now, i.e., in  September.\r\n\r\nWhen  certain sections of the Registry  have  moved\r\n\r\nout  from  Middle Road to Sin Ming Road, off  Upper\r\n\r\nThomson Road, there will be less congestion in  the\r\n\r\nadministrative  headquarters at  Middle  Road,  and\r\n\r\nwith  more  room  to  spare we shall  get  down  to\r\n\r\nimplementing  the  decision  about  acceptance   of\r\n\r\ncertificates  of  inspection.  I  hope  this   will\r\n\r\nconvince the Member that the matter has not  really\r\n\r\nbeen  forgotten  but deferred for  a  little  while\r\n\r\nbecause  of  other  pressing  problems  of  greater\r\n\r\nmagnitude. And as usual we will be carrying on with\r\n\r\nthe  same  number of staff, although  we  shall  be\r\n\r\nrecruiting  new  staff who will  not  come  to  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  until  some time  after  April  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Mountbatten, there is no\r\n\r\ndoubt that he is very observant and alert. Probably\r\n\r\nhe goes to Middle Road rather frequently to be able\r\n\r\nto notice that there is some work being carried out\r\n\r\nat  the R.O.V. premises there. It is true that some\r\n\r\nalteration work is going on, but that is to convert\r\n\r\nexisting quarters into offices, for which a  tender\r\n\r\nfor  $21,000 has been accepted. Only a part of  the\r\n\r\nRegistry is expected to move over to Sin Ming  Road\r\n\r\nin  September/October  this  year,  and  the  first\r\n\r\nmovement  will  be  the  Motor  Vehicle  Inspection\r\n\r\nCentre   where   all  vehicles  can   be   properly\r\n\r\ninspected.  The  bulk will still remain  in  Middle\r\n\r\nRoad  until  such  time  as  we  can  come  to   an\r\n\r\nunderstanding  with  the Urban Renewal  Department,\r\n\r\nwhich is eyeing the R.O.V. Middle Road site. It  is\r\n\r\nonly  after all these matters have been  agreed  to\r\n\r\nthat  we are in a position to say, \"Yes, the  whole\r\n\r\nRegistry can now move over to Sin Ming Road.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Member himself will agree to the\r\n\r\n$21,000  expenditure  on  renovations,  which  will\r\n\r\nenable  our  staff to work under  better  and  more\r\n\r\ndesirable  conditions. After all, the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nVehicles gets an annual income of $60 million,  and\r\n\r\n$21,000 is chicken feed really.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten also asked for\r\n\r\ninformation on the Sin Ming Road site. At this  new\r\n\r\nMotor  Vehicle Inspection Centre, there will be  10\r\n\r\ninspection pits as compared with only six  pits  at\r\n\r\nMiddle  Road. That means an increase of four.  This\r\n\r\nInspection   Centre,   together   with   its    own\r\n\r\nadministrative office, stores, etc., will occupy  a\r\n\r\ntotal  floor area of over 20,000 square  feet.  But\r\n\r\nthe total land area that will be made available  to\r\n\r\nthe  proposed Registry of Vehicles offices will  be\r\n\r\n2.37 acres. So at present we are really building on\r\n\r\nonly  one  part of the area that has been earmarked\r\n\r\nfor the Registry of Vehicles. There will also be  a\r\n\r\ncar park to accommodate over 40 vehicles at any one\r\n\r\ntime,  and we have the capacity to carry out 63,000\r\n\r\nproper  vehicle inspections per year. I  think  the\r\n\r\nMember asked how many inspections could be made per\r\n\r\nday.  At  63,000 inspections per year, it  will  be\r\n\r\nabout  200 inspections per working day. This number\r\n\r\ncan  be increased to 100,000 inspections per  year,\r\n\r\nas there are possibilities of future expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a little bit of the background to the\r\n\r\npresent Middle Road site. It was built way back  in\r\n\r\n1930, and it occupies an area of over 30,000 square\r\n\r\nfeet.  These  premises are situated in the  central\r\n\r\ncity area, and there is no space for expansion.  As\r\n\r\nI   have  said,  with  only  six  inspection  pits,\r\n\r\nvehicles have to queue up for inspection, and quite\r\n\r\noften  there  is  serious congestion  along  Middle\r\n\r\nRoad,  Bencoolen Street, and the roads  surrounding\r\n\r\nthe  R.O.V.  Because of this, we have to  think  of\r\n\r\nmoving  out  of the city area into the suburbs.  At\r\n\r\npresent the Inspection Centre is planned to  handle\r\n\r\nonly 36,000 inspections a year. But last\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear   there   were  as  many  as  78,000   cursory\r\n\r\ninspections, which means that the vehicles were not\r\n\r\nreally  thoroughly checked. They were just given  a\r\n\r\nquick  look-over, and then off they went. Moreover,\r\n\r\nthese  inspections were confined to public  service\r\n\r\nvehicles, buses, taxis, and goods vehicles. That is\r\n\r\nwhy this vote is a fairly urgent requirement, as it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  for  us  to get  on  with  this  new\r\n\r\nbuilding which we hope to be able to move  into  in\r\n\r\nfive months' time, i.e. September this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nMinister's explanation. I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 31 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 302.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I merely wish to\r\n\r\nseek  clarification of the New  Postal  Stores  and\r\n\r\nGarages at Clementi Road. I note that for the  last\r\n\r\nfinancial  year there was a provision of  $400,000,\r\n\r\nand  there  is a footnote to indicate a  revote  of\r\n\r\n$150,000  subject to Development Planning Committee\r\n\r\nsanction.  So doing simple arithmetic, I find  that\r\n\r\nonly  $27,000 is further required to  make  up  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  $177,000 asked for  in  the  ensuing\r\n\r\nfiscal  year.  I shall be grateful if the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications will be kind  enough  to  throw\r\n\r\nsome light on the New Postal Stores and Garages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a\r\n\r\ngood explanation for the reduction in the vote from\r\n\r\n$400,000  for the last financial year  to  $177,000\r\n\r\nfor  the ensuing year. I think it is a good example\r\n\r\nfor  all  concerned to know that, although  we  may\r\n\r\nhave  a  rather large vote to draw from, we  always\r\n\r\ngive  due consideration to the fact that if we  can\r\n\r\nget what we want at a cheaper price, it is our duty\r\n\r\nto  choose the cheaper alternative, provided we  do\r\n\r\nnot lose by doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in this case was this. In 1969 the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan Committee recommended that new  postal\r\n\r\nstores  and  postal garages should be  built  on  a\r\n\r\nthree-acre  site  at  Tannery Lane.  The  site  was\r\n\r\nallocated  by  the Commissioner  of  Lands  to  the\r\n\r\nPostal Services Department on 8th September,  1969,\r\n\r\nand  a  provision of $400,000 was included  in  the\r\n\r\n1970-71  Development Estimates  for  this  purpose.\r\n\r\nHowever,  because  of the high  estimated  cost  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  the  new  postal stores  and  garages  at\r\n\r\nTannery  Lane, the department looked for a  cheaper\r\n\r\nalternative  and  approached  the  Bases   Economic\r\n\r\nConversion  Department  in May  1970  for  suitable\r\n\r\nstores and garages which were being vacated by  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Military  Forces. The  B.E.C.D. indicated\r\n\r\nthat  No. 4 Sub Depot, 3BOD, at 7\u00bc m.s. West  Coast\r\n\r\nRoad/Clementi Road, where there were stores  and  a\r\n\r\ngarage complex with a covered storage area of  over\r\n\r\n90,000 square feet, was available and it agreed  to\r\n\r\nrelease  to  the  Postal Services  Department  just\r\n\r\nthree  of  the  store buildings, not all,  together\r\n\r\nwith  the open area around it, which cover a  total\r\n\r\narea  of  over 30,000 square feet. The  two  Nissen\r\n\r\nhuts  there  will be converted into postal  stores,\r\n\r\ngarages,  workshops, and parking areas. Because  of\r\n\r\nthis alternative, the Postal Department decided  to\r\n\r\nrelinquish the three-acre site at Tannery Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the conversion of part of the West Coast\r\n\r\nRoad/Clementi Road facilities into postal stores, a\r\n\r\nsum  of $47,000 was approved by the D.P.C, and  the\r\n\r\nD.P.S.C.  (Development Planning  Sub-Committee)  in\r\n\r\n1970.  Conversion  work,  which  is  currently   in\r\n\r\nprogress, is expected to be completed by the end of\r\n\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the architect in charge, the total\r\n\r\nprogress payment during the financial year  1970-71\r\n\r\nis   expected  to  amount  to  only  $20,000   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, there will be a revote of $27,000 in the\r\n\r\n1971-72 Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the postal garages, which are also to\r\n\r\nbe  shifted  to  the West Coast Road/Clementi  Road\r\n\r\nlocation,  conversion work is expected to  commence\r\n\r\nin the early part of the next financial year. A sum\r\n\r\nof  $150,000 is included in the 1971-72 Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  for  this project. So the two  together,\r\n\r\n$27,000  plus  $150,000, give  a  gross  figure  of\r\n\r\n$177,000.  This  therefore means that  there  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat saving of over $230,000, and this is for  the\r\n\r\ngood of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\nreply.

He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The major project will be the redevelopment of\r\n\r\nthe  Passenger  Terminal Building, for  which  $3.0\r\n\r\nmillion is provided. This project is scheduled  for\r\n\r\ncompletion by late 1971.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following those remarks, the Minister was kind\r\n\r\nenough  to  indicate the facilities that  would  be\r\n\r\navailable as a result of the redevelopment of  this\r\n\r\nterminal.  Today  this  House  is  being  asked  to\r\n\r\napprove a sum of nearly $2 million to complete this\r\n\r\nproject.  I  would  like to ask the  Minister  what\r\n\r\nprogress has been made on the redevelopment of  the\r\n\r\nPassenger  Terminal Building. In  addition  to  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  he indicated last year, what additional\r\n\r\nfacilities will be available? For example,  matters\r\n\r\nlike  the  delay  in the handling  of  baggage  was\r\n\r\nbrought   up  last  year  and  the  Minister   then\r\n\r\nindicated to the House that steps would be taken to\r\n\r\nensure that baggage handling would be much quicker.\r\n\r\nI do hope that this is so today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also brought up a point about the transit\r\n\r\nlounge in the terminal building. I had occasion  to\r\n\r\nvisit  the  transit lounge and I noticed  that  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  are still quite inadequate even  though\r\n\r\nthere  are  some  tax-free  shops  sited  in   this\r\n\r\nredeveloped terminal building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be grateful if the Minister will\r\n\r\nenlighten  this  House on the  type  of  facilities\r\n\r\nwhich will be available, because I also notice that\r\n\r\nin  his  reply last year he did indicate  that  the\r\n\r\nPassenger Terminal Building would be handling about\r\n\r\nthree  million passengers.

The answer is September of  this  year.\r\n\r\nThis  is just about six months from now, when this\r\n\r\nproject should be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next question was whether there will be\r\n\r\nclosed-circuit  television  and  a  public  address\r\n\r\nsystem.  There  will  always be  a  public  address\r\n\r\nsystem.  In  fact, this morning's  paper  announced\r\n\r\nthat the new mushroom-shaped information counter is\r\n\r\nalready  in  use from today. Our airport  hostesses\r\n\r\nwill  be  there to serve Members if they  have  any\r\n\r\nqueries to ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for closed-circuit television, we have decided\r\n\r\nnot  to  install  this. What we  have  in  mind  is\r\n\r\nsomething more expensive. It will cost about half a\r\n\r\nmillion   dollars  and  works  on  the   electronic\r\n\r\nprinciple  and  will provide information  regarding\r\n\r\nthe  movements of aircraft, expected  arrivals  and\r\n\r\ndepartures and so on. They will appear on something\r\n\r\nlike a television screen and this is supposed to be\r\n\r\nan  improvement  on  the  old-style  closed-circuit\r\n\r\ntelevision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question was, when will the first Jumbo\r\n\r\njet  land in Singapore? All this while we have been\r\n\r\nplanning  on  the basis of the Australian  Airline,\r\n\r\nQantas, starting the Jumbo jet service from  Sydney\r\n\r\nto  London.  It  was scheduled to be  September  or\r\n\r\nOctober of this year. But they have been beaten  to\r\n\r\nit  by  an  American Airline, Pan-American Airways,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  expected to inaugurate the thrice-weekly\r\n\r\nSan Francisco/Singapore service on the 26th of next\r\n\r\nmonth.  The  first Jumbo jet landing  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  therefore  be 26th of April. The  plane  will\r\n\r\ncome  all the way from San Francisco. This  is  six\r\n\r\nmonths ahead of schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of passengers in the Jumbo\r\n\r\njet,  fortunately I have gone inside one  of  these\r\n\r\nJumbo  jets before they started to fly. I  went  to\r\n\r\nthe factory when the first Jumbo jet rolled out.  I\r\n\r\nwas  two  days behind time, otherwise I would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  present at the ceremony in Seattle  in  1968.\r\n\r\nThe  plans  are that most airlines would carry  360\r\n\r\npassengers, but some airlines would like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  have 450 or 500 passengers. For the time being,\r\n\r\nall  the  airlines operate on the basis of  perhaps\r\n\r\n362  passengers. However. I will stick to  360  for\r\n\r\nthe  time  being. That answers all the  four  \"oral\r\n\r\nquestions\"  asked  by the Member for  Sembawang.  I\r\n\r\nhope I have answered them to his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Punggol, he says that\r\n\r\nthere has been a reduced vote for the redevelopment\r\n\r\nof  the  Passenger  Terminal  Building.  I  beg  to\r\n\r\ndisagree  with him. For the financial year 1970-71,\r\n\r\nit  was $3 million. For the financial year 1971-72,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a provision of $4.8 million.  There  has\r\n\r\nbeen an increase and not a decrease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I said \"increase\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am sorry.

Firstly,\r\n\r\nwhen  will  this service be implemented?  Secondly,\r\n\r\nwhat  kind  of  revenue can be  derived  from  this\r\n\r\nservice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the special\r\n\r\nvote    of   $400,000   for   establishing    radio\r\n\r\ncommunications equipment for the off-shore industry\r\n\r\nis  to meet the rather large needs of the off-shore\r\n\r\nindustry  in Singapore. They are being catered  for\r\n\r\nat  present,  of  course, by our so-called  medium-range  maritime radio telephone service. There  has\r\n\r\nbeen  considerable development since 1968 when  the\r\n\r\noff-shore  industry  decided to  establish  various\r\n\r\noffices  in  Singapore. For example, in 1967  there\r\n\r\nwere  only  677  calls.  In  1968,  it  practically\r\n\r\ndoubled to 1,331. In 1969, it shot up to 3,807. And\r\n\r\nlast  year,  there  were  6,228  calls.  There  has\r\n\r\ntherefore been an increase of 10 times in the  last\r\n\r\nthree  years. About 90 per cent of these calls  are\r\n\r\ndirectly   or  indirectly  due  to  the   off-shore\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there were the usual complaints of\r\n\r\ndelay   in  meeting  their  requirements.  So   our\r\n\r\nTelecommunications  Department  decided   to   have\r\n\r\nspecial  discussions with representatives from  the\r\n\r\noil industry. That was done last year. Two meetings\r\n\r\nwere  held  and it was then decided  to  provide  a\r\n\r\nspecial  high-quality radio communications  network\r\n\r\nexclusively  for  the off-shore oil  industry.  The\r\n\r\nnetwork, for which we are now asking for a vote  of\r\n\r\n$400,000, is really part of a number of phases. The\r\n\r\nwhole project will come to $1.3 million spread  out\r\n\r\nover  five years. Phase One will cost $800,000  and\r\n\r\nthe  sum  of  $400,000 is included in  next  year's\r\n\r\nestimates  so that we can slowly build it  up  into\r\n\r\nsomething  much bigger. This network  is  timed  to\r\n\r\ncome into operation in early 1972, and will provide\r\n\r\nvery     high     grade,    almost    cable-quality\r\n\r\ncommunication, which means to say that it  will  be\r\n\r\nfree of interference and very clear signals will be\r\n\r\nobtained through this special network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the cost effectiveness of this\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  i.e., whether we are going  to  spend\r\n\r\nall  this  money  and what about the  returns,  the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department  is  working  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of an economic service, which means that  we\r\n\r\nprovide a service but we make sure that at the same\r\n\r\ntime  we  also  make money. We are not  part  of  a\r\n\r\nsocial service where money goes out and very little\r\n\r\nis  received in return. If we provide large capital\r\n\r\nsums  for establishing a service, we expect returns\r\n\r\nwhich will make it not only economically viable but\r\n\r\nalso  profitable,  both  for  the  users  and   for\r\n\r\nourselves.  We  believe  that  the  annual   costs,\r\n\r\nincluding staff salaries, maintenance, depreciation\r\n\r\nof  equipment and other overheads, will  be  around\r\n\r\n$100,000  per annum. But the revenue we  expect  at\r\n\r\nthe  rate  matters  are  developing  can  well   be\r\n\r\n$330,000  per  annum. I think it is a  fairly  good\r\n\r\nbusiness. We spend about $100,000 per annum and  we\r\n\r\nshould  be  getting over $300,000  as  revenue  per\r\n\r\nannum.  I  think  that is why we  had  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinistry's approval for this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  his  answer  and  I  beg  leave   to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 33 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 401.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment. I merely wish to\r\n\r\ndraw the Minister's attention to the complaints  by\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  and  others  who  find  it   extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  book international telephone  calls.\r\n\r\nAccording to the telephone directory, if one wishes\r\n\r\nto book an international call, all one has to do is\r\n\r\nto dial 908. But it is becoming extremely difficult\r\n\r\nto  get  even this number, let alone get  the  call\r\n\r\nthrough to another country. I hope the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications will care to look into  this  matter\r\n\r\nand remedy the situation, because I believe that  a\r\n\r\nlot of business can be done and is being done as  a\r\n\r\nresult of telephone exchanges between Singapore and\r\n\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, it is conceded that there\r\n\r\nhas  been some justification for the complaints  by\r\n\r\nthe    public    against   our   Telecommunications\r\n\r\nDepartment.  There is really no excuse,  but  there\r\n\r\nare  certain circumstances which I hope the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Punggol and members of the public will be able\r\n\r\nto   accept.   When  debating  the   Estimates   of\r\n\r\nExpenditure  last  week,  we  have  explained   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties the Telecoms Department has  to  face.\r\n\r\nFirst, we have a high vacancy position of 9  to  10\r\n\r\nper  cent, and the existing staff have to cover  up\r\n\r\nfor the deficiency of staff. It is all very well if\r\n\r\ndevelopment  work is going on at the normal  tempo,\r\n\r\nand   so   forth.  In  the  case  of  the  Telecoms\r\n\r\nDepartment, it is doing a very fine job coping with\r\n\r\nwhat  goes on in the commercial world, because more\r\n\r\nbusiness   is   transacted,   more   requests   for\r\n\r\ntelephones,  telex, international  telephone  calls\r\n\r\nare  made.  Our range of development is spectacular\r\n\r\nand  much  too rapid for the staff or the equipment\r\n\r\nthat we have, and therefore when businessmen try to\r\n\r\nput  through  calls,  there is congestion.  And  so\r\n\r\nthere   is  delay.  Naturally  this  brings   about\r\n\r\ncomplaints.  Under  these  circumstances,  a   high\r\n\r\nvacancy  position  of  9 to  10  per  cent  and  an\r\n\r\nexceedingly  high rate of demand for  our  services\r\n\r\nhave,  together, compounded the situation and  made\r\n\r\nit appear to be worse than before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last week I assured the Member for Telok Blangah, who raised a query about gross overtime and so much time off that the Telecommunications staff could not really make use of it, that I was very confident that things should improve this year with the very large recruitment\r\n\r\nof  staff.  A  doubting Thomas, he did not  believe\r\n\r\nthat anything could be improved this year. I should\r\n\r\nlike  to  tell him that we have taken a  number  of\r\n\r\nsteps  to  improve the situation. For example,  the\r\n\r\nexchange  capacity at any one time for simultaneous\r\n\r\ncalls,  now put at 62, will be increased to  88  in\r\n\r\nthe  middle  of May. That is why we are asking  for\r\n\r\nthis provision of $39,200. This represents only the\r\n\r\nfirst phase of an extension\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogramme which was started way back in 1967 with a\r\n\r\ncapacity of only 55 calls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By early 1972, the second phase will begin to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  capacity to 118 calls.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthere   will   be   no  shortage  of  international\r\n\r\nchannels,  because our Earth Satellite  Station  at\r\n\r\nSentosa,  which  we hope will be operational  later\r\n\r\nthis  year,  will have a capacity of 132  telephone\r\n\r\nchannels. So the capacity is suddenly doubled and I\r\n\r\nsuppose  it  should be adequate for the foreseeable\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. I have explained that the Public\r\n\r\nService   Commission   has  already   completed   a\r\n\r\nrecruitment  exercise  to fill  vacancies  for  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year 1970-71, which is soon coming to  an\r\n\r\nend,  and  in  addition we have  done  a  projected\r\n\r\nincrease  in  staff  for  next  year.  So  all  the\r\n\r\nadditional  posts should be filled and  the  second\r\n\r\nhalf  of  1971  should  be  a  good  year  for  the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications    Department,    with     fewer\r\n\r\ncomplaints and more men to staff the positions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another matter which has not been given much\r\n\r\nlimelight  has been the great inadequacies  of  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  because of lack of proper training.  In\r\n\r\nOctober last year we were able to start a temporary\r\n\r\ntraining centre at No. 8, Stevens Road, and  I  had\r\n\r\nthe pleasure of performing the opening ceremony The\r\n\r\nInternational  Telecommunications  Union  has  been\r\n\r\napproached and, with the assistance of finance from\r\n\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, they will\r\n\r\nshortly  be providing us with two experts who  will\r\n\r\nbe  lecturing on technical subjects,  and  a  third\r\n\r\nexpert will be responsible for overall training co-ordination and development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have this proper training school, crash\r\n\r\ncourses will be conducted. All the new intakes will\r\n\r\nbe  required  to  undergo this  training  and  they\r\n\r\nshould  be available to man positions in the second\r\n\r\nhalf  of this year. These are all the measures that\r\n\r\nare  in  hand,  and  I hope they will  improve  the\r\n\r\nsituation in the second half of 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In view of the Minister's reply,\r\n\r\nI beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $12,345,650 for Head 33 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 41\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of Educational Television\r\n\r\nto  schools has come about some time ago and I wish\r\n\r\nto seek some information from the Minister of State\r\n\r\nfor  Education, or the Parliamentary  Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education, as to what  evaluation\r\n\r\nstudies  have been undertaken in this respect;  how\r\n\r\nmuch  benefit  school  children  are  getting  from\r\n\r\nattending E.T.V. lessons; and how many schools  are\r\n\r\ninvolved.

From  time  to\r\n\r\ntime  we  read  in the papers that E.T.V. has  won\r\n\r\nawards far and wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not very happy with the answer given by the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary regarding the percentage of\r\n\r\nprimary schools participating in E.T.V. lessons. It\r\n\r\nis  not  100 per cent. He mentioned that  75.8  per\r\n\r\ncent of our primary schools are making full use  of\r\n\r\nthe E.T.V. programmes. In the secondary schools  it\r\n\r\nis  also  not even a 100 per cent. In other  words,\r\n\r\nthere  is still room for tremendous improvement  on\r\n\r\nthe   part  of  E.T.V.

Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be\r\n\r\nreduced by 510 in respect of subhead 203.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University is a university built by the\r\n\r\ncommunity   and   financially  supported   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  If it is our hope that the development\r\n\r\nof  the University will be in keeping with reality,\r\n\r\nthen  the  Government should give massive financial\r\n\r\nsupport to the more urgent development plans of the\r\n\r\nUniversity.  I refer to students' hostels  and  the\r\n\r\nsports complex which are not receiving full support\r\n\r\nfrom the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University has recently established\r\n\r\nhonours   classes,   post-graduate   classes    and\r\n\r\nprovisional  classes.  As  a  result,  the  student\r\n\r\npopulation has increased. This year the  number  of\r\n\r\nstudents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia  has  increased  by  about  a\r\n\r\nhundred, and the provisional classes' enrolment has\r\n\r\nincreased  from  77  to 150. In  keeping  with  the\r\n\r\nchanging  circumstances and  its  own  development,\r\n\r\nNanyang  University will strive to absorb  students\r\n\r\nbeyond    Singapore   and   Malaysia.   In    these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the development of students' hostels\r\n\r\nis   most   pressing.  If,  because  of   technical\r\n\r\nproblems,  the Ministry of Education is  unable  to\r\n\r\ngive  immediate financial aid to Nanyang University\r\n\r\nto  build  students' hostels,  it  will  delay  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, there are about 2,000\r\n\r\nstudents and teaching staff at the University.  Yet\r\n\r\nthere is not a single sports stadium. No doubt  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has allotted about $700,000  last  year\r\n\r\nfor  the  development  of  a  sports  complex,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  of  underestimation or some error  in  the\r\n\r\nestimation,  Nanyang  University  asked  for   $1.2\r\n\r\nmillion instead, but this was not approved  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education.  In  order  to  meet   its\r\n\r\npressing needs, the University has come out with  a\r\n\r\ncompromise  proposal  to  build  an  indoor  sports\r\n\r\nstadium  and  a swimming pool first. However,  this\r\n\r\ncompromise  proposal has also not been accepted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education. The sum of $700,000 has\r\n\r\nbeen  allotted, but Nanyang University cannot  make\r\n\r\nuse of it because of this difficulty at the moment.\r\n\r\nWe  must realise that the University wants a sports\r\n\r\ncomplex,  not the $700,000. The Education  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  already given, free of charge and without  any\r\n\r\nbargaining,  a  library  to Nanyang  University.  A\r\n\r\npromise to aid is a promise to be executed  to  the\r\n\r\nend.  So the Ministry must similarly give a  sports\r\n\r\ncomplex too. Only thus will people believe that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  is not placing importance on intellectual\r\n\r\npursuits only at the expense of physical education.\r\n\r\nAt  present, we are in dire need of P.E. or  sports\r\n\r\nteachers, because there is no such institution.  So\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang  University sports complex  should  be\r\n\r\nable   not  only  to  contribute  to  our  national\r\n\r\nsporting  activities  but  also  to  train  up  the\r\n\r\nnecessary P.E. teachers for the various streams  of\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Member for Delta\r\n\r\nin  his  amendment. In my view, as a  graduate  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University, it is my wish  that  my  alma\r\n\r\nmater  will  improve all the time. As  a  Chinese-educated person, I will always bear in mind what I\r\n\r\nhave  obtained from Nanyang University. Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  urge  the Government to give the same treatment\r\n\r\nto  it as it gives to the University of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  two  universities have different origins  and\r\n\r\nbackgrounds, but they are, after all, our national\r\n\r\nuniversities.  The students and  graduates  turned\r\n\r\nout  by  both of them are the human resources  of\r\n\r\nour country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier in this House we heard from the Minister for Science and Technology, in reply to questions raised, that the Government is spending a lot of money on the development of the University of Singapore. It was a very rosy picture painted by the Government. It is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, my hope that the Government  will  give\r\n\r\nsimilar treatment to Nanyang University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Nanyang University happens to be in my\r\n\r\nconstituency  and,  therefore,  the  question   of\r\n\r\nstudents'  hostels  concerns  and  interests   me.\r\n\r\nBecause of the lack of hostels, the students  have\r\n\r\nto  lodge  in the cottages and attap huts  in  the\r\n\r\nvicinity of the University. Those students who are\r\n\r\nunable  to get accommodation have to stay  a  good\r\n\r\ndistance  away from the University. They  have  to\r\n\r\nspend  a  lot of money and time commuting  between\r\n\r\ntheir homes and the University. Sir, I am sure you\r\n\r\nwill agree that, because of a shortage of hostels,\r\n\r\nthe  students  suffer  great inconvenience.  Their\r\n\r\nstudies  are  also affected because of  this.  The\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  students'  hostels  in   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity is a matter of great urgency and should\r\n\r\nbe carried out forthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Nanyang University has all the land it\r\n\r\nneeds,  and  there is no problem  of  getting  it.\r\n\r\nSince the University has the land and the need for\r\n\r\nstudents' hostels is so urgent, we hope that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister will give the money straightaway to  the\r\n\r\nUniversity authorities to build them.  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  Members  in  this House  will  support  this\r\n\r\nallocation in the Development Estimates, and  will\r\n\r\nalso support a supplementary vote for this purpose\r\n\r\nif it is found necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the staff quarters are estimated to cost\r\n\r\nabout  $2.8 million, but the Government  has  only\r\n\r\nallocated $500,000, which is less than one-quarter\r\n\r\nof the actual estimate. Therefore, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister whether the Government is giving\r\n\r\nfull  support  to  this plan,  or  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nimplementing it in stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have always said that we are trying to\r\n\r\nbuild  a rugged society but the Government is  not\r\n\r\ngiving  full support to the building of  a  sports\r\n\r\ncomplex  in Nanyang University. This is  a  matter\r\n\r\nfor  regret.  As  far  as I know,  the  Government\r\n\r\ndepartment concerned has already estimated that  a\r\n\r\nsports  complex of this nature will require  about\r\n\r\n$1.2  million.  This  being  so,  why  cannot  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education be generous enough  to  give\r\n\r\nall  the money required and let Nanyang University\r\n\r\nhave its sports complex? The land for this complex\r\n\r\nhas  been levelled, but construction work has  not\r\n\r\nyet  begun. So I hope the Minister will reconsider\r\n\r\nthe  vote  for  the  sports  complex  for  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker.

I would be grateful  if\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   of  State  for  Education   could\r\n\r\nenlighten  this  House  on  why  this  revote   is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  The money was already  voted  for  and\r\n\r\nought to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  spent.  If the money had been spent,  my  two\r\n\r\ncolleagues  who,  I  believe,  come  from   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  would  have  no  squabble   with   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education. I can understand  why  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Jurong wants more money. It is quite  a\r\n\r\nreasonable request, because he has some very strong\r\n\r\ngrounds  for  it, and I am with him on this  point.\r\n\r\nAnd if I may draw the attention of the Minister  of\r\n\r\nState   to  page  4  of  the  Memorandum   on   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates, para. 25 under Head 41, the\r\n\r\nintention is extremely clear:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A sum of $2.85 million is provided for the new\r\n\r\nRaffles Institution...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if Raffles Institution, which is a secondary\r\n\r\nschool,  can get $2.85 million, why cannot  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  which is a university, get  the  money\r\n\r\nasked  for?

After the technical problems  have  been\r\n\r\nsolved, we shall proceed with the construction work\r\n\r\nforthwith.

I believe the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Delta and the Member for Jurong are aware that\r\n\r\nthe  Council  of Nanyang University  have  recently\r\n\r\nstarted a campaign to raise funds with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  target of $2 million, part of which is meant for\r\n\r\nbuilding a students' hostel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the question of a sports complex, as\r\n\r\nearly  as 1969 Nanyang University proposed  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education a plan for a sports  complex\r\n\r\ncosting  $620,000. After consideration the Ministry\r\n\r\ncounter-proposed with a $700,000 plan.  They  asked\r\n\r\nfor  $620,000  and we gave them $700,000!  In  this\r\n\r\nplan  the  facilities included a swimming pool  and\r\n\r\nother    amenities.   But   subsequently    Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  wanted  to  make  amendments   to   the\r\n\r\noriginal  proposal by including the building  of  a\r\n\r\nstadium. The amendments would require a further sum\r\n\r\nof  $500,000 making the total cost of the plan $1.2\r\n\r\nmillion. This matter is now under consideration  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Education and  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol asked why a revote of\r\n\r\n$692,000  is asked for, when we have already  voted\r\n\r\n$700,000 for the last financial year. I am not able\r\n\r\nto  answer  this  fully. However, we  have  already\r\n\r\nallotted the money to the University, and it is  up\r\n\r\nto  them  to spend it. One of the reasons  for  not\r\n\r\nspending it could be that the plan for $1.2 million\r\n\r\nis  still  under  consideration. You  cannot  first\r\n\r\nbuild  a sports complex costing $700,000, and  then\r\n\r\ndecide to build another one for $1.2 million. So we\r\n\r\nmust  wait for the overall planning to be completed\r\n\r\nbefore  we can proceed with the construction.

Out of these four routes, only  one\r\n\r\nroute  has  a service at four-minute intervals  and\r\n\r\nthe  others are at 15-minute intervals.

It  has  only  eight  classrooms,   one\r\n\r\nlaboratory and, of course, some toilets. There  are\r\n\r\nno  other  facilities. It is just a  simple  school\r\n\r\nwith  simple facilities. Of course, one  laboratory\r\n\r\nis not enough and so the facilities are inadequate.\r\n\r\nIn  spite  of  this, in the academic field  and  in\r\n\r\nsports,   this   school  has  had   good   results,\r\n\r\nespecially in horticulture.

So far the Centre,\r\n\r\nwhich  was established in 1967, has produced  1,613\r\n\r\npersonnel  for  the  hotel catering  industry.  The\r\n\r\nbreak-down is as follows:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n          Receptionist               226\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Cashiers                    46\r\n\r\n</pre>          \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n          Restaurant and bar\r\n\r\n            waiters and waitresses   969\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Room stewards and\r\n\r\n            stewardesses              372\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIn   fact,   the  Centre  does  not  train   toilet\r\n\r\nattendants whose job is much more lucrative!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centre does not send any graduates overseas\r\n\r\nfor   further  training.  I  believe  the  brighter\r\n\r\ngraduates from this Centre are being sent  overseas\r\n\r\nby the industry which engage them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised by the Member is the acute\r\n\r\nshortage  of  hotel catering staff and whether  the\r\n\r\nCentre  will  be  able to meet the demand.  Between\r\n\r\n1967, when the Centre was established, and now, the\r\n\r\nnumber of hotel rooms has increased eleven-fold. It\r\n\r\nis  hardly  possible  for the Centre  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nsudden  large demand for hotel staff, but I believe\r\n\r\nmost  hotels are training their own staff. However,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  new  Centre moves into new premises,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  gradually  shifting our  emphasis  on  to\r\n\r\ntraining the middle and higher levels of personnel,\r\n\r\nleaving  the  training of waiters  and  waitresses,\r\n\r\nstewards and stewardesses, room chambermaids,  etc.\r\n\r\nto the hotel industry itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of pure numbers, the new Director\r\n\r\nof  the  Centre arrived a month ago.

Then the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  said,  \"Well, put  them  into  vocational\r\n\r\ninstitutes  and  teach them.\"  But  how?  They  did\r\n\r\nacquire  some sort of skill. Later on the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education came up with another idea  and  said,\r\n\r\n\"Look,  now  we want the vocational schools  to  be\r\n\r\nconverted  into  vocational institutes.\"  But  Sir,\r\n\r\nthese  vocational institutes carried another  name.\r\n\r\nThey were called \"Industrial Training Centres\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that the Technical Education\r\n\r\nDepartment of the Ministry of Education  is  trying\r\n\r\nto  mislead this House with regard to the technical\r\n\r\neducation policy. What I wish to know is what  sort\r\n\r\nof   courses,  and  up  to  what  level  are   such\r\n\r\ninstitutions giving? There is a saying \"A  rose  by\r\n\r\nany other name smells just as sweet\" - but I do not\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  this can be applied to the  schools!\r\n\r\nThere  is  the \"bilateral school\", the  \"vocational\r\n\r\ninstitute\" and the \"industrial training centre\"! We\r\n\r\nhave  a lot of our young students who may not  have\r\n\r\nthe  intelligence to proceed to the purely academic\r\n\r\nstream.  So  when  the  shift  comes  to  technical\r\n\r\neducation,  we have all sorts of institutes  called\r\n\r\nby  all  sorts  of names. We have  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nwhilst  we  put  up  such institutes,  the  courses\r\n\r\norganised  must  be so designed as  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nstudents  to obtain jobs that will be available  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I have in my constituency the\r\n\r\nPonggol Vocational Institute,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  the  item under this subhead should not  read\r\n\r\n\"Ponggol   Vocational  Institute\",   but   \"Ponggol\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Training Centre\". What is unique  about\r\n\r\nit  is this. I noticed that at the beginning it had\r\n\r\na  small name-plate put up near the fence, and  the\r\n\r\nname  was  `Ponggol  Vocational School\".  This  was\r\n\r\nremoved,   and  the  new  name  was  the   \"Ponggol\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Training  Centre\".  But  down  it  came\r\n\r\nagain.  I  do not know whether or not the  students\r\n\r\nthere  are  trying  to apply the skills  they  have\r\n\r\nlearnt  in this Industrial Training Centre. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of  State for  Education  will  take\r\n\r\nserious  note of this, otherwise this will lead  to\r\n\r\nvery  serious trouble. We say that we have to  rely\r\n\r\non  semi-skilled and fully-skilled labour, and  yet\r\n\r\nwe cannot produce enough from such institutions. So\r\n\r\nthe  present situation is, as I believe Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  House are fully aware, that we have to  import\r\n\r\ncertain types of skills, even the common skills. In\r\n\r\nother words, there should be a clear-cut policy  on\r\n\r\nall  the  courses conducted, spelling out  whatever\r\n\r\nlevel  of skills the courses are designed  for,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the parents when they think of sending  their\r\n\r\nchildren to such institutions, will be rest assured\r\n\r\nthat  their children are going to acquire a certain\r\n\r\nlevel of skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I admire\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Punggol for his deep understanding\r\n\r\nof  the  history  of technical education.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike,  first  of all, to deal with the question  of\r\n\r\nvocational schools, and then go on to the policy of\r\n\r\ntechnical education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has very clearly pointed\r\n\r\nout that the vocational schools were instituted  in\r\n\r\n1960 to train those pupils who failed in Primary VI\r\n\r\nfor  a  certain  trade up to a semi-skilled  level.\r\n\r\nThat did not prove to be as successful as we wanted\r\n\r\nit  to  be. When the Technical Education Department\r\n\r\nwas established in 1968, one of the first decisions\r\n\r\nmade  was  to  abolish the vocational schools.  So,\r\n\r\ninstead of taking in pupils who were thrown out  of\r\n\r\ntheir  former  schools, we took in pupils  who  had\r\n\r\nfinished Secondary II for two years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  instruction, and let them acquire a  vocational\r\n\r\nskill that is employable. This is on the same lines\r\n\r\nas  those run by the Singapore Vocational Institute\r\n\r\nat  Balestier  Road which, I  think,  is  a  well-established  institute and everyone knows  what  it\r\n\r\nstands  for. The vocational institute is  to  train\r\n\r\nsemi-skilled  craftsmen; I would say craftsmen  who\r\n\r\nhave  the skill but not the experience. We  decided\r\n\r\nto  convert  all vocational schools into vocational\r\n\r\ninstitutes. This conversion commenced in  1969  and\r\n\r\nis   continuing  to  this  day.  Since   1969   all\r\n\r\nvocational schools have been abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol raised the question of the\r\n\r\nPonggol   Industrial  Training  Centre  which   was\r\n\r\noriginally  the  Ponggol  Vocational  School.   The\r\n\r\nreason why it was changed to the Ponggol Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining  Centre was this: The Industrial  Training\r\n\r\nCentre  was  first established to  provide  a  very\r\n\r\nshort  crash  programme  for training  semi-skilled\r\n\r\noperatives,  not  craftsmen,  say  people  who  lay\r\n\r\nbricks, plasters, plumbers, and so on. Their's is a\r\n\r\nvery  limited skill and requires only a very  short\r\n\r\ntraining  period.  After  a  year's  operation,  we\r\n\r\ndecided  that  we should enlarge its activities  to\r\n\r\nprovide  not  only just short training courses  but\r\n\r\nalso  two-year training courses. With this in mind,\r\n\r\nwe  introduced  in 1969 the module training  scheme\r\n\r\nthat  integrates  all training  systems  under  one\r\n\r\nsingle scheme. I shall touch on this later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the confusion arises because of this. In order to clear up the confusion, there must be more confusion to begin with. That is why in order to have all secondary schools called secondary schools, you begin with bi-lateral schools and integrated schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Technical Education Department do have a very\r\n\r\nclear-cut policy on technical education,  and  this\r\n\r\nis  stated  in the Second Annual Report  which  was\r\n\r\ntabled in this House as Paper Cmd. 22 of 1970. Very\r\n\r\nbriefly  we separate the scheme into areas -  those\r\n\r\nwithin the school and those outside the school. The\r\n\r\ntraining  within  the  school  system  is  done  in\r\n\r\nordinary secondary schools which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  a  technical department. The courses  have  a\r\n\r\nhigher   theoretical  content,  and   prepare   the\r\n\r\nstudents  for examinations leading to  the  General\r\n\r\nCertificate  of  Education,  Ordinary   Level   and\r\n\r\nAdvanced Level. The training for those outside  the\r\n\r\nformer  secondary school system is carried  out  in\r\n\r\nvocational institutes. All the industrial  training\r\n\r\ncentres are being converted - I should not use  the\r\n\r\nword  \"converted\" but rather \"upgraded\" to take  in\r\n\r\nmore machinery. It is not the same syllabus. If you\r\n\r\ngo  through the budget you will find that  actually\r\n\r\nmore  machinery has been provided so as to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  facilities  and  methods of  training  in  the\r\n\r\nvocational institutes. The training programme is in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the module training system,  which\r\n\r\nis mentioned in the Report. It is widely adopted in\r\n\r\nEuropean countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it was recently adopted by the British.\r\n\r\nThe   Research  Department  did  a  very   thorough\r\n\r\nresearch   of  all  the  technical  education   and\r\n\r\nvocational  training  programmes  in  the   various\r\n\r\ncountries at various stages of development and,  as\r\n\r\na result of such an intensive study, they have come\r\n\r\nout  with  this  module  training  scheme  for  our\r\n\r\nvocational institutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  wish to know whether the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  for Education is able to indicate the number\r\n\r\nof   graduates  who  have  passed  out  from   such\r\n\r\ninstitutions, and whether they have  been  able  to\r\n\r\nfind employment.

But the output\r\n\r\nof  the  vocational institutes will be raised  from\r\n\r\nabout 1,800 in 1970 to about 10,000 in 1980.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the point whether the graduates\r\n\r\nhave acquired employable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nskills, the difficulty is for them to get deferment\r\n\r\nfrom  national service to enable them  to  take  up\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I do not think that is the\r\n\r\nanswer.

The Minister\r\n\r\nof State has quoted 1970 figures, but we know quite\r\n\r\nwell  that  these vocational institutes started  in\r\n\r\n1969  and the Minister of State has mentioned short\r\n\r\ncourses.  In  other words, in the  course  of  time\r\n\r\nthere must have been a good number of students  who\r\n\r\nhave  passed  out from such institutes.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nhas  the  Ministry taken a closer look to  see  how\r\n\r\nmany of these students who have passed out have got\r\n\r\nemployment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, first of all, let us\r\n\r\ntake,  for example, the vocational institute nearer\r\n\r\nto  the  Member  for  Punggol,  i.e.,  the  Ponggol\r\n\r\nVocational  Institute. One of the  difficulties  we\r\n\r\nare  facing in respect of this particular programme\r\n\r\nat  the  Ponggol Vocational Institute is  that  the\r\n\r\nstudents  are required to go outside  and  work  in\r\n\r\nindustry  for three months, and they have  acquired\r\n\r\nso much skill by then that they will not come back.\r\n\r\nThe  pay  is  so good! That is one difficulty.  The\r\n\r\nother  example  I can think of is  in  the  welding\r\n\r\ntrade,  for  example. I think the biggest  training\r\n\r\ninstitute  we have is the Pasir Panjang  Vocational\r\n\r\nInstitute,  and our graduates are booked  up  until\r\n\r\nthe end of next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, though I agree that there\r\n\r\nis  an  institute  known as the Ponggol  Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining Centre sited in Punggol, I can safely  say\r\n\r\nthat more than 90 per cent of the students are  not\r\n\r\nfrom  Punggol.

This has been done in keeping with the requirements of our industrialisation policy. Because of this, many technical schools have been built all over\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  technical education  has  received\r\n\r\npopular  support  from  the  parents  who  are  now\r\n\r\nprepared   to  send  their  children  to  technical\r\n\r\nschools  and  institutes.  This  is  a  matter  for\r\n\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question is whether technical education\r\n\r\nhas been very effective, whether its programme has,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  been able to provide the talent required\r\n\r\nfor  the  various  industries as a  result  of  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Therefore, I would like the  Minister\r\n\r\nof State to answer five questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Since the establishment of the vocational\r\n\r\ninstitutes and technical schools more  than  a\r\n\r\nyear  ago have there been any statistics taken\r\n\r\nof   the  number  of  students  trained,   and\r\n\r\nwhether   they   have  been   able   to   find\r\n\r\nemployment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) With particular reference to the Singapore Technical Institute, when will it be\r\n\r\ncompleted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What facilities are available at present, and\r\n\r\nwhich   countries   supply   us   with    such\r\n\r\nequipment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Up to the present moment are there adequate\r\n\r\ntechnical   instructors  to  cope   with   the\r\n\r\nrequirements for technical education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) I would like to ask the Minister of State\r\n\r\nthis  question,  and that  is  whether  he  is\r\n\r\naware  that,  because of poor  maintenance,  a\r\n\r\nlot   of   new  machinery  in  many  technical\r\n\r\nschools  has  broken down. That  is  not  all. Nobody  is  able  to do the repairs.  This  is\r\n\r\nactually  a  waste of public  funds.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike the Minister to take immediate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naction  to look into this matter and see  that\r\n\r\nthe   machinery  is  properly  maintained  and\r\n\r\nrepaired in case of break-downs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Parliament has\r\n\r\nbeen asked to approve a sum of $1.8 million for the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Technical Institute.  From  what  I  can\r\n\r\ngather  at  the present moment, this  Institute  is\r\n\r\nsharing its premises, that is, workshops and  other\r\n\r\nfacilities, with another institute which, I believe\r\n\r\nis  the  former  Junior Trade School  at  Balestier\r\n\r\nRoad.   The   Singapore  Technical   Institute   is\r\n\r\nconsidered   an   institute  of  higher   technical\r\n\r\nlearning.   Why  should  it  share  its  workshops,\r\n\r\nprobably   classrooms  too,   with   a   vocational\r\n\r\ninstitute? The Minister of State for Education  has\r\n\r\nclearly explained just now the different levels  of\r\n\r\ninstruction  between the vocational institutes  and\r\n\r\nthe  schools.  I believe that there is  a  distinct\r\n\r\ndifference  between the level of instruction  in  a\r\n\r\nvocational  institute and a technical institute.  I\r\n\r\nsuspect that the Singapore Technical Institute will\r\n\r\nsomehow be duplicating some of the courses  run  or\r\n\r\norganised  by  the Polytechnic. In his  reply  last\r\n\r\nyear, the Minister of State clearly explained  that\r\n\r\nthere  was some duplication and he would see to  it\r\n\r\nthat  there would be none. In other words, if there\r\n\r\nis  a  duplication of courses, what is  the  use  of\r\n\r\nhaving  both  the  Polytechnic  and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTechnical Institute?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask is the level\r\n\r\nof   instruction  which  the  Singapore   Technical\r\n\r\nInstitute  offers.

The first part  of  his\r\n\r\nquestion has been amply answered in my reply to the\r\n\r\nMember  for Punggol in an earlier question. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Punggol may like to explain to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Sembawang asked a question\r\n\r\nabout the output of graduates in 1968. I happen  to\r\n\r\nhave  the  figures  here. The  Technical  Education\r\n\r\nDepartment  was established in 1968. The vocational\r\n\r\ninstitutes produced 518 graduates in 1968,  400  in\r\n\r\n1969 and the same number in 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Technical Institute, which was\r\n\r\nformed in 1969, produced only the first batch of 96\r\n\r\ngraduates in February this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also asked when the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Technical Institute will  be  completed.\r\n\r\nJust  now on my way from the airport to this House,\r\n\r\nI  did some counting of the storeys of the building\r\n\r\nand  it  has  come up to the 10th floor.  They  are\r\n\r\nputting  a roof on it. It should be completed  some\r\n\r\ntime this year. It is in MacPherson Road, in a very\r\n\r\nclean environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about the facilities and\r\n\r\nequipment.   These  are  provided  for   mechanical\r\n\r\nengineering,  electrical engineering,  electronics,\r\n\r\nrefrigeration  and air-conditioning  and  furniture\r\n\r\nproduction.  Most  of this equipment  is  purchased\r\n\r\noverseas, particularly from the United Kingdom, as\r\n\r\nthis  Institute is being financed under the British\r\n\r\nmitigatory aid scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next question is whether we have sufficient\r\n\r\nteachers  for technical education to cope with  the\r\n\r\nrapid  expansion in industry. The answer is no.  We\r\n\r\nare  trying  our very best to train them.  We  hope\r\n\r\nthat  in about two years' time we shall be able  to\r\n\r\nproduce enough teachers. Unfortunately, in the case\r\n\r\nof   technical  teachers,  we  cannot  have  relief\r\n\r\nteachers. They must be properly trained. We will be\r\n\r\nexpecting  something  like  300  trained   teachers\r\n\r\ncoming  out  this year. One of the difficulties  we\r\n\r\nare  facing  is that every time we finish  training\r\n\r\nthe teachers, the industries find that they are  so\r\n\r\nwell trained that they just grab them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> We can bond them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> This is a free country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I mean an education bond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> With regard to the last\r\n\r\nquestion about the maintenance of equipment, I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Sembawang will appreciate that this\r\n\r\nis  a  training institute.

Can\r\n\r\nI take the Member for Punggol back to 1960? He will\r\n\r\nrecall  that  the present Vocational Institute  and\r\n\r\nthe Polytechnic were housed together under the same\r\n\r\nroof in Prince Edward Road. In fact, in the case of\r\n\r\nthe  Polytechnic in London, they train people  from\r\n\r\nsemi-skilled level right up to Ph.D. in Engineering\r\n\r\nunder  the  same roof. The reason why the Singapore\r\n\r\nTechnical  Institute  is housed  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nVocational Institute is that, first, we  feel  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  need  for a supply of  what  we  call\r\n\r\nindustrial technicians. They are the lower level of\r\n\r\ntechnicians.  There is a great need for  them  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, we borrow the premises at the  Singapore\r\n\r\nVocational  Institute to make an early  start.  The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Vocational Institute is about  the  best\r\n\r\nequipped  institution we have, and since the  class\r\n\r\nis small we have it there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has also asked whether\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  some duplication  of  instruction.\r\n\r\nDuplication will be inevitable, Sir. The  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic runs two types of courses, a three-year\r\n\r\nTechnician  course, which is called the engineering\r\n\r\ntechnician,  and  a two-year Industrial  Technician\r\n\r\ncourse, which is called the General Certificate  of\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Training.  The  course  run   at   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Technical Institute is similar  to  this\r\n\r\ntwo-year course. I believe that at present there is\r\n\r\na   joint  committee  of  the  Singapore  Technical\r\n\r\nInstitute and the Singapore Polytechnic to work out\r\n\r\na  common scheme. I appreciate the concern  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Punggol  that as far  as  possible  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  duplicate, but since  the  demand  for\r\n\r\ntechnicians  is so large, the Singapore Polytechnic\r\n\r\nalone   will   not  be  able  to  train  sufficient\r\n\r\nindustrial technicians.

Each of these  sets\r\n\r\nof  equipment  consists  of  a  transmitter  and  a\r\n\r\nreceiver.   These  two  sets  of   microwave   link\r\n\r\nequipment  represent the additional minimum  number\r\n\r\nrequired  to  allow for the programmes  originating\r\n\r\nfrom  a venue outside the T.V. studio centre to  be\r\n\r\ntransmitted back to the centre. In years past,  two\r\n\r\nsets  of  such  microwave link equipment  could  be\r\n\r\nconsidered sufficient. But recently, in view of the\r\n\r\nincrease of building activities in Singapore,  many\r\n\r\nhigh-rise buildings constitute obstructions to  the\r\n\r\nline of sight between most of the venues of outside\r\n\r\nbroadcasts   and   the  T.V. studio   centre.

The first was, what\r\n\r\nare  the  outside broadcasting vans used for?  They\r\n\r\nare  used  for  relaying  outside  programmes  like\r\n\r\nsports,  or programmes which we have to relay  from\r\n\r\nthe  theatres, like the National Theatre,  back  to\r\n\r\nthe  studio centre. Some shows cannot be staged  in\r\n\r\nthe T.V. studio and, therefore, we need to hire  or\r\n\r\nborrow space in the National Theatre or some  other\r\n\r\nplace  to  stage  the shows and  make  use  of  the\r\n\r\noutside  broadcasting vans to send  the  programmes\r\n\r\nback via microwave link to the studio centre either\r\n\r\nfor recording or for direct broadcast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang then asked whether or\r\n\r\nnot this equipment would provide more programmes. I\r\n\r\nwould say yes, for outside broadcasts are something\r\n\r\nwhich  we have to use at functions like sports  and\r\n\r\nalso like the National Day parade. We can broadcast\r\n\r\nthese events direct to the people at the time  when\r\n\r\nthe function is on. It provides a sense of intimacy\r\n\r\nto  the  audience and in a way it would enrich  the\r\n\r\ncontents  of the programme and give rise to  better\r\n\r\naudienceship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I am unable to give the Member the\r\n\r\ndetails  of  the  equipment that  we  have  in  the\r\n\r\noutside  broadcasting unit.

There are only two community  centres  in\r\n\r\nthe  constituency. Both of these  two  centres  are\r\n\r\nsited  in  a very inconspicuous position,  and  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  there are particularly  inadequate  for\r\n\r\nthe  large number of residents in the constituency.\r\n\r\nI  am  aware  that there is another  self-contained\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre which is being completed  in  the\r\n\r\nwestern sector.

The  Member  should\r\n\r\nconsider  himself fortunate to have three community\r\n\r\ncentres  in  one  constituency because  many  other\r\n\r\nconstituencies have only one. However, it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis agreed and accepted that Toa Payoh needs another\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre  in  the eastern  sector  of  the\r\n\r\nconstituency. In fact, the People's Association has\r\n\r\nbeen  discussing this matter with the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board for quite some time, but  so  far\r\n\r\nit  has  not  been able to obtain a  suitable  site\r\n\r\nthere. The Association will continue its search, in\r\n\r\nconsultation with the Member for Toa  Payoh  for  a\r\n\r\nsuitable  site  in the future. In  order  that  the\r\n\r\ncommunity    centre   will   provide   satisfactory\r\n\r\namenities to the residents, a building of at  least\r\n\r\nthe   size  of  the  present  one  which  is  being\r\n\r\ncompleted  in  Toa  Payoh  West,  will  be  needed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is this necessity to search for an\r\n\r\nempty  piece  of land rather than to incorporate  a\r\n\r\ncommunity centre in an existing flat. If the Member\r\n\r\nhas any suitable site in mind, he is welcome to put\r\n\r\nforward  his  proposal to the People's  Association\r\n\r\nand we will consider it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, it is indeed\r\n\r\nheartening  to  listen to the Minister's  comments,\r\n\r\nbut may I make just a point of clarification?

I\r\n\r\ndid mention one centre which is being completed now\r\n\r\nat Lorong 1A. I believe there are quite a number of\r\n\r\nvacant  plots of land in Toa Payoh East.

According to the\r\n\r\nMemorandum on the Development Estimates, in page 5.\r\n\r\nsection 37, it is very clear that the sum of  money\r\n\r\nto  be voted for will be not only for the Pasir Ris\r\n\r\nHoliday  Flats but also for two community  centres.\r\n\r\nParagraph 2 of section 37 states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A sum of $313,000 is provided as subsidy for\r\n\r\nresiting the Kampong Glam Community Centre and  the\r\n\r\nKota  Raja  Community Centre. The  balance  of  the\r\n\r\nprovision  is  for  the construction  of  five  new\r\n\r\nstandard  community  centres  and  five  new  rural\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres.  The sites of  these  community\r\n\r\ncentres have yet to be decided.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not asking that there should be a new\r\n\r\ncommunity centre in Punggol. I am not going to  ask\r\n\r\nfor  any more community centre. My quarrel with the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture is that if one takes $3l3, 000\r\n\r\nout of this allocation for subhead 101, nothing  is\r\n\r\nleft  in  the  provision  to  construct  five   new\r\n\r\nstandard  community  centres  and  five  new  rural\r\n\r\ncommunity centres. I do not know how this  equation\r\n\r\nis going to work out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is about the\r\n\r\nfacilities  at  these community  centres.  We  have\r\n\r\nmanagement   committees  in  all  these   community\r\n\r\ncentres, and invariably facilities are lacking.  As\r\n\r\na  result, the management committees have  to  look\r\n\r\nfor funds to enable them to have more facilities at\r\n\r\ntheir    centres.   I   understand   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  does  give a certain  sum  as  subsidy\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the  type of centre,  to  all  these\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres.  If they are  of  the  standard\r\n\r\ntype,  they get more, and if they are of the  rural\r\n\r\ntype,  they  get less. In this respect,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is wise simply to subsidise a  community\r\n\r\ncentre  so  that  it will be run by the  management\r\n\r\ncommittee, and not lift a finger to help  when  the\r\n\r\nmanagement committee asks for extensions and better\r\n\r\nfacilities for their community centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reinforce my argument, I will bring up one\r\n\r\npoint,  and  that is the extension to  the  Punggol\r\n\r\nCommunity Centre. The management committee did  not\r\n\r\nget a cent from the Government, but fortunately  we\r\n\r\nhad some good Samaritans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey pooled their resources together and managed to\r\n\r\nput up the extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, these points have been raised and\r\n\r\nMinisters have replied, \"Why not do it on your own,\r\n\r\nsince  other centres can get more money to increase\r\n\r\nthe  facilities  of  their own  centres?\"  This  is\r\n\r\nhardly a wise move, because we have a provision  of\r\n\r\n$313,000  in  the  Development  Estimates  for  two\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres affected by urban renewal.  What\r\n\r\nabout   those   centres  that  really   need   such\r\n\r\nfacilities,  for example, the rural  type?  Such  a\r\n\r\ncentre has only one room, partitioned into a  small\r\n\r\noffice and a store room. They expect the management\r\n\r\ncommittee to run kindergarten classes with  limited\r\n\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Culture will bring these\r\n\r\npoints  to the attention of the authorities in  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association and take the necessary  steps\r\n\r\nto remedy such a situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nunder this amendment, I would like to bring up  one\r\n\r\nor two points about community centres. Earlier on I\r\n\r\nsaid  that  Jurong is a new town and the population\r\n\r\nis increasing all the time. Probably in five years'\r\n\r\ntime the number of people will exceed 100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a lack of recreational facilities in Jurong. At night it is a dead place. At the moment we have a community centre in Jurong, but it is sited in one of the flats belonging to the Jurong Town Corporation. I hear that the People's Association intends to build a community\r\n\r\ncentre, not in a flat, but elsewhere. There are one\r\n\r\nor  two community centres in an isolated corner  of\r\n\r\nJurong. They are quite inaccessible to many  people\r\n\r\nin  Jurong. Therefore, there is a need to build not\r\n\r\njust  a  community centre but a bigger one  in  the\r\n\r\ncentre of Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his reply to the Member for Toa Payoh, the\r\n\r\nMinister   said  that  he  could   not   find   any\r\n\r\nappropriate  site  for a community  centre  in  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh. But in Jurong I know that the J.T.C. has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalready  designated a certain area for the building\r\n\r\nof  community  centres. I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister if the People's Association have any  plan\r\n\r\nto  build a community centre in Jurong and, if  so,\r\n\r\nwhen they intend to carry it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Member for Punggol on bringing  up\r\n\r\nthe  point  of  adequacy  of  funds  for  community\r\n\r\ncentres. But I hope that not all the $313,000  will\r\n\r\nbe  taken up for the resiting of the two centres as\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  the  Memorandum on  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to seek information from the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether there is provision for a standard\r\n\r\ncommunity centre at the Old Kallang Airport  Estate\r\n\r\nin  my  constituency, and whether a site  has  been\r\n\r\nlocated  by  the  People's  Association  for   this\r\n\r\npurpose.  Sir, a site near Block 93 at Jalan  Satu,\r\n\r\noff Old Airport Road, was, in fact, proposed by  me\r\n\r\nin  1965 for a community centre. But it was  turned\r\n\r\ndown by the Housing and Development Board as it was\r\n\r\nmeant for some other purposes. Up to now, this site\r\n\r\nis  still  left  vacant. I wonder if  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  will  reopen  negotiations  with   the\r\n\r\nHousing   and  Development  Board  to   develop   a\r\n\r\ncommunity centre on this site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to stress that there is a great need for a\r\n\r\ncommunity centre in the Old Kallang Airport  Estate\r\n\r\nin  view  of the fact that about 34,000 people  are\r\n\r\nnow living there. You will agree with me, Sir, that\r\n\r\ncommunity  development is important  in  a  housing\r\n\r\nestate. Although there is now a community centre at\r\n\r\nGuillemard  Road,  which was  formerly  the  Katong\r\n\r\nBoys'  Club  and was converted into the Mountbatten\r\n\r\nCommunity Centre in 1960, it is sited in  a  remote\r\n\r\ncorner of my constituency and is far away from  the\r\n\r\nbulk  of  the population. This being the  case,  it\r\n\r\ndoes   not  adequately  serve  the  needs   of   my\r\n\r\nconstituents. In fact, it serves predominantly  the\r\n\r\npeople  from  the Geylang area. Will  the  Minister\r\n\r\nlook into this matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I am not going  to  ask  for\r\n\r\nmore  as  there is no land available. Fair  enough.\r\n\r\nBut  this  present community centre is very  small.\r\n\r\nOriginally  we estimated that the community  centre\r\n\r\nwould   cost   about  $80,000,  but  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation said at that time that since funds were\r\n\r\nnot  available they could give us only $40,000  for\r\n\r\nit.  Therefore, we could only build  a  very  small\r\n\r\ncommunity centre in my constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he will\r\n\r\nconsider  extending  the  building  of  the   Anson\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre. Perhaps the management committee\r\n\r\ncould  try  to get some money from the public  and,\r\n\r\ntogether   with   assistance  from   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation, we could then extend the  building  as\r\n\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Punggol  need not worry that we are  going  to\r\n\r\nspend  a  large  amount of money on  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres affected by urban renewal. In fact, out  of\r\n\r\nthe  $300,000 asked for under subhead 101,  we  are\r\n\r\nonly  allotting  about $50,000 to the  new  Kampong\r\n\r\nGlam  Community Centre which is affected  by  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal,  and only about $10,000 for the  community\r\n\r\ncentre  at Nelson Road which is affected by certain\r\n\r\nprojects. Another sum of $10,000 will be  spent  on\r\n\r\nresiting   the   Kota   Raja   Community    Centre.\r\n\r\nAltogether,   about  $70,000  will  be   spent   on\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  which  are  either  resited  or\r\n\r\naffected  by urban renewal. The bulk of  the  money\r\n\r\nasked  for is meant for five new community  centres\r\n\r\ncosting $46,000 each. They are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) At the former Christian cemetery, off Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah Road. This new community centre is asked  for\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Cairnhill, because he is of  the\r\n\r\nopinion that his constituents living in the Selegie\r\n\r\nRoad area, which forms part of his constituency, do\r\n\r\nnot  have  community centre facilities at  present.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  he  needs one to serve  the  population\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The second one will be sited at Upper\r\n\r\nAljunied  Road. There is at present  one  community\r\n\r\ncentre in Aljunied Constituency, at Joo Seng  Road.\r\n\r\nThis  community  centre is situated  in  a  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard   flat   and  is  found  to   be   not   very\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  The  Member  for  Aljunied  and  the\r\n\r\nmanagement committee of that community centre  have\r\n\r\nasked  for a new centre to be built on a  piece  of\r\n\r\nland  along  Upper  Aljunied Road  to  replace  the\r\n\r\npresent  one. So another $46,000 goes towards  this\r\n\r\nnew community centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The third one is to be built at Whitley Road.\r\n\r\nThere are only two rural-type community centres  in\r\n\r\nTanglin  Constituency at the  moment,  namely,  the\r\n\r\nKampong  Chantek  Lama  Community  Centre  and  the\r\n\r\nOnraet Road Community Centre. We have now completed\r\n\r\nplans to build standard-type community centres  for\r\n\r\nTanglin, because it is the only constituency  which\r\n\r\nhas no standard-type community centre at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The fourth community centre will be built at\r\n\r\nKallang  Basin.  The  present community  centre  is\r\n\r\nsituated  on  the ground floor of a  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflat.  Again,  it is not suitable for the  purpose,\r\n\r\nand therefore the Housing Board has agreed to build\r\n\r\na  new one in that constituency. This needs another\r\n\r\n$46,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The fifth community centre is the answer to\r\n\r\nthe  query from the Member for Mountbatten. It will\r\n\r\nbe  at  the  Old  Kallang Airport Estate.  But  the\r\n\r\nproblem is that we still have not been able to find\r\n\r\na  piece  of land suitable for a community  centre.\r\n\r\nThe  money is there but we will have to wait  until\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Mountbatten is satisfied  that  a\r\n\r\nsuitable  piece  of land can be found.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  the problem is not that we are not  spending\r\n\r\nmoney  on  the building of standard-type  community\r\n\r\ncentres, but how to spend it wisely and get maximum\r\n\r\nvalue out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of extension of a community centre\r\n\r\nand  expansion  of  its  existing  facilities,  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  involved  is  not  as  much  as   that\r\n\r\nincurred  in  building  a  new  community   centre.\r\n\r\nNormally the cost ranges from a few\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthousand  dollars to about $20,000. In  such  cases\r\n\r\nthe  public-spirited management  committee  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity   centres   have  undertaken   to   raise\r\n\r\ndonations  on  their own and have  taken  pride  in\r\n\r\ndoing   so.   They  only  approach   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  for  technical  advice,  such  as  the\r\n\r\npreparation of building plans, the cost of which is\r\n\r\nnormally  borne by the Association.  In  the  event\r\n\r\nthat   the   management   committee   has   genuine\r\n\r\ndifficulties in raising donations, the  Association\r\n\r\nhas  always  rendered financial  assistance.  There\r\n\r\nwere,   in   fact,  instances  when  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation   constructed  basketball   courts   or\r\n\r\nprovided basketball stands and lights and so on for\r\n\r\ncommunity centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were, however, cases where community\r\n\r\nleaders  were  over-zealous and  wanted  to  extend\r\n\r\ntheir community centres to a size out of proportion\r\n\r\nto  the  centres'  actual  requirements.  In  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances,   the   Association    had    always\r\n\r\ndiscouraged them from doing so. Where they insisted\r\n\r\non  going  ahead with the project by  assuring  the\r\n\r\nAssociation that they could manage on their own, it\r\n\r\nis  understandable that the Association was  unable\r\n\r\nto  help  much, bearing in mind that we  have  only\r\n\r\nlimited   funds  provided  in  our  estimates   and\r\n\r\nexcessive  expenditure  of  public  funds  is   not\r\n\r\njustifiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a recognised fact that the management\r\n\r\ncommittees have rendered invaluable services  since\r\n\r\ntheir  inception  in  1964. Besides  providing  the\r\n\r\nvital  link between the Government and the  people,\r\n\r\nthey  serve  as  a catalyst in the evolution  of  a\r\n\r\nspirit   of   public   involvement   in   community\r\n\r\nactivities. Because of the public spirit  of  these\r\n\r\npeople, the community centres are accepted as  part\r\n\r\nof  the people's own property. There is, therefore,\r\n\r\nthe existence of a sense of pride in the people  in\r\n\r\nthese  centres. This is a healthy sign and  may  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as  a  national asset. It is,  therefore,\r\n\r\nfelt  that  financial  assistance,  if  given   too\r\n\r\nreadily,  will serve to curb the spirit  of  public\r\n\r\ninvolvement   which  is  being   nurtured   through\r\n\r\nrelentless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nefforts,  and  will  encourage  a  sense  of  over-reliance by the community centre on the Association\r\n\r\nto provide every recreational facility. It need not\r\n\r\nbe emphasised that the spirit of public involvement\r\n\r\nmust not be hampered. On the other hand, it must be\r\n\r\nencouraged and allowed to develop until  the  stage\r\n\r\nis reached when the community centres will be built\r\n\r\nfor  the people, by the people and managed  by  the\r\n\r\npeople themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has asked for a community\r\n\r\ncentre  in Jurong.

Thus,\r\n\r\ntheir time is not wasted whilst they are in prison.\r\n\r\nThey  therefore  have  an opportunity  to  increase\r\n\r\ntheir   knowledge  in  various  spheres  of   life,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  the technical  field.

It so, where can we  buy  them?  To\r\n\r\ntravel  to  the prisons in order to make  purchases\r\n\r\nwill  be  shameful  as people will  have  to  enter\r\n\r\nthrough the prison gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Are there classes in the prisons teaching\r\n\r\nacademic  subjects? I think it  is  very  important\r\n\r\nthat the prisoners increase their knowledge through\r\n\r\neducation  so  that  they  can  become  responsible\r\n\r\ncitizens in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to inform the Member for  Sembawang\r\n\r\nthat  in  our  prisons every prisoner is  given  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to learn a trade. I would like to  give\r\n\r\nsome  examples.  First,  if  he  has  worked  as  a\r\n\r\ncarpenter before, he can continue with this  trade.\r\n\r\nThen  there  is metal work. Some are doing  laundry\r\n\r\nwork, sewing or rattan work and upholstery. We have\r\n\r\nall kinds of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when a juvenile delinquent enters a\r\n\r\nprison, the first thing we do is to find out why he\r\n\r\nhas  come to prison. If he is intelligent, we  give\r\n\r\nhim a more complicated job to do. If he is not very\r\n\r\nwell  educated, he will be given any work  that  he\r\n\r\nprefers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot give the Member for Sembawang all the\r\n\r\ninformation.  In 1956 we collected revenue  to  the\r\n\r\ntune   of   $287,000.  But  in  1970  we  collected\r\n\r\n$1,221,135. We can see from these two figures  that\r\n\r\nwe have made progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's other question was, where can\r\n\r\nmembers of the public buy the handicraft works that\r\n\r\nhave  been made by the prisoners? They can get them\r\n\r\nfrom  Changi Prison, or Penang Lane, or any of  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare homes. We have show-cases in  these\r\n\r\nplaces  and  any Member who wants to  buy  anything\r\n\r\nmade  by  the prisoners is invited to go there  and\r\n\r\nbuy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding academic studies in prison, this is\r\n\r\nreally  a  very important matter. If  our  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquents  enter prison and are not given  proper\r\n\r\ntraining,  they  might,  after  discharge,  get  in\r\n\r\nagain.  Sir, we have a definite plan for prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe  inmates do not just sit and waste their  time.\r\n\r\nThey learn a trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also asked what we\r\n\r\nhave achieved in Changi Prison. We have classes for\r\n\r\nlanguages  as well as academic subjects. This  year\r\n\r\nfour  of  the  prisoners who sat for the  Cambridge\r\n\r\nSchool Certificate examination\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanaged  to obtain very good results. One  of  them\r\n\r\nobtained a Grade I certificate with distinctions in\r\n\r\nEnglish  and English Literature and had credits  in\r\n\r\nBible  knowledge and History. Two  of  them  had  a\r\n\r\nGrade  two certificate. This is a good example  set\r\n\r\nby  these  prisoners.  We  do  not  like  prisoners\r\n\r\nwasting  their  time in prison.  We  like  them  to\r\n\r\nimprove themselves and when they get out of  prison\r\n\r\nlater  on, they will have the necessary skills  and\r\n\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nas   the   Parliamentary  Secretary  has  given   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory explanation.

What  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  know is whether the allegations  made  by\r\n\r\nsome quarters that Government acquires land cheaply\r\n\r\nand  sells it at a big profit are true.

I notice that a vast stretch of land  has\r\n\r\nalready been reclaimed on the east coast, and  many\r\n\r\nquestions have been posed to the Government on  the\r\n\r\noptimum  use of the land. At the moment, I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  certain stretches of the land are  ready  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  In  fact, a few military  camps  have\r\n\r\nalready  been  set up at Bedok.

Two days  ago,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law and National Development said that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  does not make  exorbitant  profits\r\n\r\nwhen  it acquires land and subsequently resells  it\r\n\r\nfor  urban  renewal  projects.  I  agree  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment incurs expenditure on clearing the land,\r\n\r\nlaying out the site and setting aside a portion  of\r\n\r\nit  for road widening, and, when the site is  ready\r\n\r\nfor  development, sells it. But how much  does  all\r\n\r\nthis  cost  the Government? It acquires land  at  a\r\n\r\nvery low price. The clearance of squatters does not\r\n\r\ncost  much to the Government, because the squatters\r\n\r\nare  resettled  in  alternative  accommodation   in\r\n\r\nHousing and Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard flats and a meagre sum is paid to  them\r\n\r\nas  disturbance allowance. This cannot be  compared\r\n\r\nwith  the  price at which the Government sells  the\r\n\r\nland  by tender. Sometimes the tender price  is  10\r\n\r\ntimes the amount it pays for acquiring the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not quarrelling about land acquisition and\r\n\r\nthe sale of sites made ready for urban renewal, nor\r\n\r\nabout  the  moral behind it. What I want  to  speak\r\n\r\nabout is the compensation the Commissioner of Lands\r\n\r\npays to landowners when their property is acquired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many cases where the compensation\r\n\r\noffered  by the Commissioner of Lands is far  below\r\n\r\nthe  market price. And when the appellant takes the\r\n\r\nmatter  to the Appeals Board, he has to pay  $5,000\r\n\r\ndeposit  in court and engage lawyers to  argue  the\r\n\r\ncase.  In many instances, the Commissioner of Lands\r\n\r\nhas settled cases with landowners at a higher price\r\n\r\njust  before  the  hearing of the  appeal.  If  the\r\n\r\nappellant is rich, he can afford to pay the deposit\r\n\r\nand engage lawyers to argue the case. But if he  is\r\n\r\npoor, he cannot afford to pay the deposit or engage\r\n\r\nlawyers and he has to accept the unfair award  made\r\n\r\nby the Commissioner of Lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the valuers in the office of the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Lands are incompetent  or  fear  to\r\n\r\nmake  correct  valuations or  are  over-zealous  in\r\n\r\ntrying  to  save the Government as  much  money  as\r\n\r\npossible  to  the  detriment of the property-owning\r\n\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that in order to prevent\r\n\r\nproperty  owners  from  submitting  their  valuer's\r\n\r\nreport  challenging  the  valuation  of  the   Land\r\n\r\nOffice,  the Land Office declares the  land  to  be\r\n\r\nacquired as an open space or as a green belt.  When\r\n\r\nthis is done, the land has no commercial value  and\r\n\r\nthe private valuers refuse to value it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of an instance where, in spite of the\r\n\r\ndeclaration of a piece of land as a green  belt,  a\r\n\r\nreputable  firm was prepared to buy this  piece  of\r\n\r\nland  at $10 per square foot and pay the Government\r\n\r\ndevelopment  charges in order to convert  the  land\r\n\r\nfor other uses and remove the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreen  belt.  But what happened was that  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice did not want to lift the green belt.  Is  it\r\n\r\nfair?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister will explain this and also\r\n\r\nexplain the workings of the notice of intention  to\r\n\r\nacquire land, issued under section 3 of the Act  in\r\n\r\nrelation to a subsequent acquisition under  section\r\n\r\n5 of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, considerable\r\n\r\ninterest  inside and outside this  House  has  been\r\n\r\naroused  in  respect of my denial of the allegation\r\n\r\nthat  Government makes exorbitant profits  when  it\r\n\r\nacquires  land and subsequently sells  it.  At  the\r\n\r\noutset, I must point out that I did not say that we\r\n\r\ndo  not  make any profit. We do. But not  in  every\r\n\r\ncase  and the profits are certainly not exorbitant.\r\n\r\nThat  was the myth I was referring to - \"exorbitant\r\n\r\nprofits\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last Tuesday I took pains to outline the\r\n\r\nseveral  factors  why  land sold  under  the  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal  sales,  sells at higher  prices  than  the\r\n\r\nactual price of acquisition. I need not repeat  all\r\n\r\nthese  factors again. But the major  ones  which  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  are  the  generous instalment  terms  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the sale price -20 per cent down payment\r\n\r\nand the rest over 10 to 20 years. Secondly, the  12\r\n\r\nper cent property tax which is very attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I reiterate that the procedure for the\r\n\r\nacquisition of land is set out clearly in the  Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition Act, 1966, which obliges the Government\r\n\r\nto  acquire land at market value. The Act  provides\r\n\r\nfor  an  appeal to the Appeals Board if  the  owner\r\n\r\nfeels  that  he has been inadequately  compensated.\r\n\r\nThere  have been grumblings about the valuation  of\r\n\r\nour  valuers.  But on an appeal, the appellant  has\r\n\r\nhis  own  valuers to give their valuation.  So  the\r\n\r\njudge hears both sides and he decides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to costs, I find it hard to believe that an\r\n\r\nowner of land cannot raise $5,000 to pay costs.  If\r\n\r\nhe  is really broke, he can fight his own case.  If\r\n\r\nhe  is  not broke, he gets hold of a lawyer. But  I\r\n\r\nrepeat  I find it hard to believe that an owner  of\r\n\r\nland  in Singapore cannot afford the services of  a\r\n\r\nlawyer or a valuer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been asked by the Member for Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  to explain section 3 of the Act. Under  this\r\n\r\nsection,    a   notification   is   published    of\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention to acquire a particular land\r\n\r\nrequired for a public purpose. The section is  used\r\n\r\nonly  in  cases of real necessity and primarily  to\r\n\r\nput  a  stop to unscrupulous speculative land deals\r\n\r\nwhich often take place as soon as it is learnt that\r\n\r\na  property  is likely to be subject to  compulsory\r\n\r\nacquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to acquire the land, we send a team\r\n\r\ndown  to  survey it. The moment they see the  team,\r\n\r\nsome, I do not say all, arrange for a resale. Hence\r\n\r\nsection  3.  If we move under section  3,  we  must\r\n\r\nacquire   the  land  within  six  months   of   the\r\n\r\nnotification.  If  we do, then  the  price  is  the\r\n\r\nmarket  price  at the date of the notification.  If\r\n\r\nthe  land is not acquired within six months of  the\r\n\r\ndate  of  notification, any subsequent  acquisition\r\n\r\nunder  section 5 will have to be made at the market\r\n\r\nprice  on the date of acquisition under section  5.\r\n\r\nThe  only  advantage is the six months'  period  to\r\n\r\nprevent  speculative dealings once the owners  hear\r\n\r\nthat acquisition may take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a further mischievous impression has been\r\n\r\ncreated   by   the   allegation   that   Government\r\n\r\nindiscriminately  re-zones private  lands  as  open\r\n\r\nspaces  so  that they can be acquired  cheaply  and\r\n\r\nresold  at  much higher prices. This is  completely\r\n\r\nmisleading.  There are only two cases of  re-zoning\r\n\r\ninitiated  by  Government prior to acquisition,  as\r\n\r\nagainst  the  hundreds of cases of acquisition  and\r\n\r\nthe hundreds of cases where private landowners have\r\n\r\nobtained an alteration of the zoning in respect  of\r\n\r\ntheir own lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir complained about the\r\n\r\nGovernment not allowing someone to re-zone so  that\r\n\r\nhe  could  sell  the land at $10 a square  foot.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the land is a \"green belt\" area. To  allow\r\n\r\nhim  to  re-zone would be all right if the planners\r\n\r\nthink there should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  re-zoning, but the action of re-zoning  is  not\r\n\r\njust  to  allow him to make a huge profit. He  must\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the planners that re-zoning is  justified,\r\n\r\nin  which case he must set out his grounds. If they\r\n\r\nagree,  he gets it. But to grumble and say, \"I  can\r\n\r\nsell  my land at $10 a square foot if you allow  me\r\n\r\nto re-zone\", is, I think, a weak argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not denied that the Government can acquire\r\n\r\nrent-controlled  properties at  a  low  price.  But\r\n\r\nGovernment properties are not bound by the  Control\r\n\r\nof  Rent  Ordinance,  and  the  argument  is  quite\r\n\r\nirrelevant.  May I put it this way? If Government's\r\n\r\nintention   is  to  make  profits   out   of   land\r\n\r\ntransactions,  it  would simply acquire  all  rent-controlled  properties, say, in the  \"Golden  Shoe\"\r\n\r\narea and resell them to private developers who  are\r\n\r\nhungry   for   land  for  redevelopment.   Instead,\r\n\r\nGovernment has introduced new legislation to enable\r\n\r\nprivate  landowners to obtain vacant  possession  of\r\n\r\ntheir properties upon payment of compensation to be\r\n\r\nawarded by the Tenants Compensation Board. We would\r\n\r\nlike   to  invite  private  participation  in   the\r\n\r\nredevelopment of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned just now two cases in which we\r\n\r\nre-zoned  before  we  acquired  the  land.  If  the\r\n\r\nobjective  was  to resell the land  for  money,  we\r\n\r\nwould  resell  both properties. You cannot  make  a\r\n\r\nprofit  until you resell. In neither of  these  two\r\n\r\ncases has the land been resold. One recent case  is\r\n\r\nstill the subject of an appeal. Since the matter is\r\n\r\nsub  judice, Mr Speaker, Sir, and as I am reminded\r\n\r\nof your warning earlier on this afternoon, I am not\r\n\r\nfree  to  comment on it. But in another  case,  the\r\n\r\nproperty was re-zoned precinctal open space so that\r\n\r\na  garden  for  the benefit of the  general  public\r\n\r\ncould be developed. The Government did not sell the\r\n\r\nland.  In order to create this garden, we  did  not\r\n\r\nthink  we should pay the price of the land  at  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  rate. Hence the re-zoning to precinctal\r\n\r\nopen  space, and there is your garden.  The  owners\r\n\r\nhad   their  remedies.  They  objected.  When   the\r\n\r\nrezoning took place, there was a hearing. They were\r\n\r\nheard and the re-zoning was upheld. They had legal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvice. They could have taken the matter further to\r\n\r\nthe High Court if they had felt that the principles\r\n\r\nof  natural justice had not been complied  with  by\r\n\r\nus.  Perhaps  it  is either because  of  the  legal\r\n\r\nadvice  or  their public spirit that they  did  not\r\n\r\ntake the matter further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not denied that in the few cases where\r\n\r\nacquired  properties were resold  under  the  Urban\r\n\r\nRenewal  Redevelopment Scheme, Government  obtained\r\n\r\nhigher  prices than the prices paid  for  them.  In\r\n\r\naddition  to  the  reasons I  have  already  given,\r\n\r\nanother reason for the higher prices is that  there\r\n\r\nis  usually a lapse of time between acquisition and\r\n\r\nresale of the same properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the first sale of urban renewal sites, we\r\n\r\noffered  several sites along the \"Golden Mile\"  for\r\n\r\npublic tender. No one tendered for any site. Anyone\r\n\r\nwho had tendered at $5 a square foot would have got\r\n\r\nthe   land.  But  no  one  tendered;  no  one   was\r\n\r\ninterested.  That  was several years  ago.  In  the\r\n\r\nsubsequent  second  and  third  sales,  the  prices\r\n\r\njumped up. Today they are rushing to get land along\r\n\r\nthe  \"Golden Mile\" at $60 to $70 a square foot. But\r\n\r\ndo  not  blame us for that. The price of  land  has\r\n\r\ngone up since. Let us put it the other way. Let  us\r\n\r\nsay that the price of land has gone down. Who bears\r\n\r\nthe  loss?  We bear the loss! Perhaps we  can  take\r\n\r\nsome of the credit. The place is booming, money  is\r\n\r\nrushing  in, and the recent increases in the  price\r\n\r\nof  land  have  been  quite fantastic.  Because  of\r\n\r\nstability, everyone in Singapore benefits; so  does\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise that of the three sales\r\n\r\nof urban land undertaken by the Government, only  a\r\n\r\nvery small percentage of the land sold was acquired\r\n\r\nland. I will give you the figures. Most of the land\r\n\r\nwas always Government land which we offered to them\r\n\r\nthree  years ago and which no one wanted. Now  they\r\n\r\nare all rushing in. The details are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first sale, about 33 acres of land were\r\n\r\nsold  by  tender. Ninety-two per cent of  this  was\r\n\r\nstate land and was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalways state land. Some 8 per cent was private land\r\n\r\nwhich was acquired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second sale, 13 acres were sold - 75 per\r\n\r\ncent  was  state land and 25 per cent private  land\r\n\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third sale, 14 acres were sold - 78 per\r\n\r\ncent  was  state land and 22 per cent private  land\r\n\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Members are interested in the land along\r\n\r\nthe \"Golden Mile\". Of the roughly 23 acres sold  in\r\n\r\nwhat we call \"the Golden Mile\" area, 96 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe land sold was always Government land and a mere\r\n\r\n4  per  cent (about 25,000 square feet) was private\r\n\r\nland acquired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may also be interested in the state land\r\n\r\nat  Shenton Way which is selling today  at  $90  to\r\n\r\n$100  a  square  foot. People are rushing  to  buy.\r\n\r\nPlease do not think that we acquired this land. All\r\n\r\nthe   state  land  along  Shenton  Way  always  was\r\n\r\nGovernment land. We have acquired not one per  cent\r\n\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I say that without urban renewal,\r\n\r\nthis   town  cannot  develop.  With  rent  control,\r\n\r\nprivate  owners find it hard to evict  tenants  and\r\n\r\nredevelop  sites. Government owns large  tracts  of\r\n\r\nland  and  has acquired some pieces. There  was  an\r\n\r\nallegation  before that the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard wanted to develop the whole of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nhence  we  invited  private participation.  But  we\r\n\r\ncannot  just  give the land to the buyer  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Pay $5 for it.\" Then there will be allegations  of\r\n\r\nbribery  and corruption. One has to have  a  public\r\n\r\ntender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first public sale was not successful. Only\r\n\r\nseven  sites  were taken up, and  there  were  only\r\n\r\nabout  13  or  14 tenderers. In the  second  public\r\n\r\nsale, people became wiser, and about a little  more\r\n\r\nthan  50  tenders were received in  respect  of  14\r\n\r\nsites,  and  13  were sold. In the last  and  third\r\n\r\nsale, more than a hundred tenders were received for\r\n\r\n14 sites, all of which were sold. If we do not have\r\n\r\na  public tender, then there will be the allegation\r\n\r\nthat  Government  wants to redevelop  the  land  by\r\n\r\nitself.  This is not true. We are happy  to  invite\r\n\r\nprivate participation. As far as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   \"Golden  Shoe\"  is  concerned,  rent  control\r\n\r\nlegislation  was  amended  in  order  to  encourage\r\n\r\nprivate participation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I say that whatever profit the\r\n\r\nGovernment  makes  goes into the  treasury  and  is\r\n\r\nploughed  back by way of social services  to  build\r\n\r\nroads and schools, supply water, lights and gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.
