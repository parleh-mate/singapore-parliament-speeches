I\r\n\r\nalso  have a Certificate of Urgency by the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara to proceed with the Bill through  all\r\n\r\nits stages under Standing Order No. 81.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my statement at the sitting of the Assembly on\r\n\r\n11th  December, 1963, I have already touched  on  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of the setting up of a one-man Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  to  look  into  and  examine  the  financial\r\n\r\ntransactions  of three deregistered trade  unions.  I\r\n\r\nhave   already   recounted  to   hon.   Members   how\r\n\r\nunscrupulous and mercenary anti-national  leaders  of\r\n\r\nunions  could usurp the funds of the workers  towards\r\n\r\npurposes  inconsistent with the objects and rules  of\r\n\r\nthe  unions to the detriment of the unions and danger\r\n\r\nto  the  State.  In order that the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  may  be  safeguarded,  the  Government   now\r\n\r\nconsider it necessary that the Bill before the  House\r\n\r\nshould be taken through all its stages and passed  on\r\n\r\na   Certificate   of  Urgency.  As  I   have   stated\r\n\r\npreviously, the reason for bringing in the Bill on  a\r\n\r\nCertificate of Urgency is obvious. The Assembly  will\r\n\r\nbe  adjourning shortly and it is necessary  that  the\r\n\r\nBill  be passed in order that there will be effective\r\n\r\nlegislation to prevent trade union funds  from  being\r\n\r\nfrittered   away   illegally  and  dishonestly.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment at present have no power to deal with  the\r\n\r\nfunds  of unions which are deregistered or are  being\r\n\r\ngiven  notices to show cause why they should  not  be\r\n\r\nderegistered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Unions Ordinance which was passed in 1940\r\n\r\ndid not foresee that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  are  so-called  trade union  leaders  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  capable of taking away  large  amounts  of\r\n\r\nmoney of the workers for purposes known only to their\r\n\r\nsecret masters. As a result of this, once a union  is\r\n\r\nderegistered, the money of the union is left  at  the\r\n\r\nmercy  of the union leaders. Amongst themselves  they\r\n\r\ncan  do  anything they like with the money.  Although\r\n\r\nunion  rules require them to distribute the money  to\r\n\r\nthe  general  members, in most cases  this  is  never\r\n\r\ndone.  In fact, in the case of the Singapore  General\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union, the Secretary-General, when  called\r\n\r\nupon by the police to explain why certain amounts  of\r\n\r\nmoney  were  expended, disappeared  with  some  union\r\n\r\nminute books. So you can see how dangerous it  is  to\r\n\r\nleave  large amounts of money in the hands  of  union\r\n\r\nofficials who are capable of going underground at any\r\n\r\nmoment.  They  do not have the workers' interests  at\r\n\r\nheart. The workers' money is not used to further  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers. It is being used  for  some\r\n\r\ninexplicable purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 3rd September, 1963, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nissued  a writ to dissolve the previous Assembly  and\r\n\r\nordered fresh elections. Everyone knew that elections\r\n\r\nwere  coming  and elections cost money.  And  it  was\r\n\r\nexactly  on  this  day, the 3rd  of  September,  that\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the  three unions,  viz,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGeneral  Employees'  Union,  the  Singapore  Business\r\n\r\nHouses  Employees'  Union,  and  the  Singapore   Bus\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union decided to withdraw large amounts  of\r\n\r\nmoney from their banks. I can leave it to you to draw\r\n\r\nyour  own  conclusion as to what they intend  to  use\r\n\r\nthis  money for. The Government cannot afford  to  be\r\n\r\ncomplacent  in this matter. If we are to protect  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers, I am sure hon. Members will\r\n\r\nagree  that stringent and urgent action must be taken\r\n\r\nto deal with the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the Trade Unions Ordinance does not\r\n\r\nempower the Minister or the Registrar of Trade Unions\r\n\r\nto  freeze  the bank accounts of any trade  union  if\r\n\r\ninformation is received that the union\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintends to utilise its funds for any purpose contrary\r\n\r\nto  the  provisions of the Ordinance or the rules  of\r\n\r\nthe  union itself. While the Registrar has  power  to\r\n\r\napply to the Court for an injunction to restrain  any\r\n\r\ntrade  union from unlawful expenditure of its  funds,\r\n\r\nthis  process  in  law, however, is  not  practicable\r\n\r\nespecially when the matter has to be dealt with on an\r\n\r\nimmediate  basis. Because the present Ordinance  does\r\n\r\nnot  provide  the necessary powers, the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions  could only advise  banks  holding  the\r\n\r\naccounts of unions to suspend payment of any  cheques\r\n\r\ndrawn  on  them. Although in the case  of  the  three\r\n\r\nderegistered  S.A.T.U. unions the  banks  co-operated\r\n\r\nwith   the  Government,  they  were  in  a  difficult\r\n\r\nposition as the Government's request had no statutory\r\n\r\nbacking. This being so, the banks would therefore  be\r\n\r\nliable  for  damages  if  they  were  sued  by  their\r\n\r\nclients.  As  Government had perforce to  freeze  the\r\n\r\nfunds  of  these unions, it was necessary, therefore,\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to give a categorical  assurance\r\n\r\nthat  it would indemnify any legal costs arising from\r\n\r\nany  proceedings  as  a result of  their  failing  to\r\n\r\nhonour the unions' cheques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite action taken by the Registrar to request\r\n\r\nthe  banks  to  withhold withdrawals which  might  be\r\n\r\ninitiated by these three S.A.T.U. unions, two of  the\r\n\r\nunions,  however, were able to withdraw about $30,000\r\n\r\nfrom  their accounts in a number of banks before  the\r\n\r\nbanks   could  receive  Government's  indemnification\r\n\r\nassurance. The new section 15A provided in  clause  2\r\n\r\nof the Bill will now enable the Minister, where he is\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  the  funds  of  any  unions  may  be\r\n\r\nmisused,  to order any bank in Singapore not  to  pay\r\n\r\nany money or to cash any cheques of the unions for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  not  exceeding  three months.  Non-compliance\r\n\r\nwith  this  order will make the manager of  the  bank\r\n\r\nliable to punishment as set out in subsection (3)   of\r\n\r\nsection  15A. Subsection (2)  will, of course, absolve\r\n\r\nthe  bank  of  any liability arising from  compliance\r\n\r\nwith the order\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the Minister. Clause 3 of the Bill amends section\r\n\r\n18  of the Ordinance, and this amendment is necessary\r\n\r\nhaving regard to the new section 18A provided  under\r\n\r\nclause 4. The new section 18A in clause 4 of the Bill\r\n\r\nwill  obviate any undue delay in the winding  up  and\r\n\r\ndisposal of funds of unions which have been dissolved\r\n\r\non  the  grounds  that  they  have  not  applied  for\r\n\r\nregistration  or  where their registration  has  been\r\n\r\nrefused,  withdrawn  or  cancelled.  There  are  many\r\n\r\ninstances where unions that have been dissolved  have\r\n\r\nstill  to  wind  up  and dispose of  their  funds.  A\r\n\r\nglaring instance is that of the Singapore Factory and\r\n\r\nShop  Workers' Union, which was deregistered in 1957,\r\n\r\nand  to  date it has still to wind up and dispose  of\r\n\r\nits funds.

Members will, therefore, see that the\r\n\r\npowers  sought in the new section 18A are  necessary.\r\n\r\nOnce  a  trade union is dissolved, the assets of  the\r\n\r\nunion  will vest immediately in the Official Assignee\r\n\r\nin  Bankruptcy so that he can proceed to wind up  the\r\n\r\naffairs  of  the  union.  Any  surplus  assets  after\r\n\r\nproviding for all debts and liabilities will, if  the\r\n\r\nMinister directs, be paid into the Consolidated Fund;\r\n\r\nor  where no such direction is made, will be disposed\r\n\r\nof  as  provided in the rules of the trade  union  in\r\n\r\nquestion. It is very necessary that the assets of the\r\n\r\ndissolved  trade  union should vest in  the  Official\r\n\r\nAssignee  in Bankruptcy to prevent officials  of  the\r\n\r\nunion from making any withdrawals on the accounts  of\r\n\r\nthe  union  held by any bank between the period  when\r\n\r\nnotice  has  been  given by the  Registrar  of  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions to the union of the intention to dissolve such\r\n\r\nunion,   and  the  actual  date  of  dissolution   if\r\n\r\ndissolution takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already recounted instances of such\r\n\r\nirresponsible  withdrawals in my  statement  of  11th\r\n\r\nDecember.  This  will  make very interesting  hearing\r\n\r\nwhen the Commission of Inquiry sits to look into  the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 18B gives retrospective effect to\r\n\r\nthe Bill so that the unions deregistered or cancelled\r\n\r\nprior to the date of 11th December, 1963, can be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndealt  with in the same way. I would like, therefore,\r\n\r\nto  commend this Bill to the House so that it can  be\r\n\r\ntaken  through all its stages and passed  at  today's\r\n\r\nsitting.  I  do  not  propose  to  overemphasise  how\r\n\r\nessential it is for Government to be given the powers\r\n\r\nsought in the Bill. Any person having the interest of\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and the protection of the  funds  which\r\n\r\nrightfully  belong  to the workers  will  undoubtedly\r\n\r\nsupport the enabling measures that will be vested  in\r\n\r\nGovernment by the amendments proposed in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  fact that the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nhave  now  tabled this Trade Unions (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nshows that they are taking further action against the\r\n\r\nworkers.  This will thus deal a blow to  the  workers\r\n\r\nwho  do not allow themselves to be controlled by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  The  P.A.P. have always boasted in  the  past\r\n\r\nthat  it is their intention to have an open argument.\r\n\r\nBut  this so-called open argument and competition has\r\n\r\nnot been used in the true sense. As a result of their\r\n\r\ninsincerity  in  the  so-called  open  argument   and\r\n\r\ncompetition, the Government have taken action to  ban\r\n\r\nsome  trade  unions and have arrested their  leaders.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the workers and their leaders who  went  on\r\n\r\nstrike  were assaulted. Apart from this,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment have also made use of the State  machinery\r\n\r\nto break up the non-P.A.P. union strikes. This can be\r\n\r\nseen from their repressive actions in the past. Seven\r\n\r\nunions   were   dissolved.   The   application    for\r\n\r\nregistration  by S.A.T.U. was also turned  down.  The\r\n\r\nNaval  Base Workers' Union strike, which lasted about\r\n\r\nthirty  days,  was a legitimate strike.  But  it  was\r\n\r\nbroken  up  by  the  P.A.P. by  illegal  means   and\r\n\r\ndespicable methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of all these actions, the P.A.P. have\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that they have not sufficient  powers  to\r\n\r\ndeal with the workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhose only wish is to struggle for a better life  and\r\n\r\nimprove  their  working conditions, which  are  their\r\n\r\nlegitimate rights. In spite of all these actions, the\r\n\r\nworkers are as united as ever. They are as adamant as\r\n\r\never.  This  fact has worried the P.A.P. very  much.\r\n\r\nThat is why the P.A.P. are now taking a step further.\r\n\r\nThey  are  abusing the legal and State  machinery  by\r\n\r\ntabling  this  Bill,  which is  an  attempt  to  gain\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  the  unions' funds.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\nunions  which  do  not  support  the  P.A.P. can  be\r\n\r\ncontrolled by the P.A.P. There are provisions in this\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions  (Amendment)  Bill  which  empower  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  freeze a union's funds deposited  in  a\r\n\r\nbank  for  a period of three months when the Minister\r\n\r\nis  satisfied that the funds may be misused. We  know\r\n\r\nthat  workers  have contributed to the trade  unions'\r\n\r\nfunds by way of monthly subscriptions. Therefore, the\r\n\r\ndisposal  of  the  funds should  be  decided  by  the\r\n\r\nworkers  themselves and not by the Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  The funds should not be interfered with.  The\r\n\r\ntrade  union  officials  have  been  elected  by  the\r\n\r\nworkers  themselves.  They  have  been  entrusted  to\r\n\r\nadminister  the  funds. They are held responsible  to\r\n\r\nthe workers and members of the unions. So long as the\r\n\r\nworkers  of the unions agree to the action  taken  by\r\n\r\ntheir   elected  officials,  and  so  long   as   the\r\n\r\nadministration   of   the  unions'   funds   is   not\r\n\r\ninconsistent  with the rules and regulations  of  the\r\n\r\nunions, the Minister should not be given any right to\r\n\r\ninterfere  with  such administration of  the  unions'\r\n\r\nfunds. In fact, nobody should be allowed to interfere\r\n\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase \"satisfied that it is likely that the\r\n\r\nfunds  of  the  union  may be misused\",  is  actually\r\n\r\ntypical  of Fascist methods. It seems that  only  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  able to decide whether a union's  funds\r\n\r\nare  being  used in the right and proper  manner.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that if the Minister is given this power,  then\r\n\r\nhe  may  make use of this power as an excuse to  take\r\n\r\naction  against the union which refuses to  be  under\r\n\r\nthe control of the P.A.P. Trade union funds come from\r\n\r\nthe workers themselves. They subscribe to these funds\r\n\r\nin  their own interest and for union activities. They\r\n\r\ncan be considered as the capital of the workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  their  union activities. If their funds  can  be\r\n\r\nfrozen at the whims and fancies of the Minister, then\r\n\r\nthe  workers will face great difficulties in carrying\r\n\r\nout  their  activities. They will have  no  financial\r\n\r\nbacking  if they wish to increase their wages through\r\n\r\nlegitimate  methods. For example,  if  members  of  a\r\n\r\nunion  decide  to stage a strike or  take  any  other\r\n\r\nindustrial  action, which is their weapon,  to  fight\r\n\r\nfor better working conditions, then the Minister may,\r\n\r\nif  he so desires, break up this impending strike  or\r\n\r\neven  if  a  strike is on. He does this  by  exerting\r\n\r\npressure on the bank to freeze the funds of the union\r\n\r\nin  question. If a union is not able to withdraw  its\r\n\r\nfunds from the bank, how are the workers to have  any\r\n\r\nmeans  of livelihood during the period of the strike?\r\n\r\nHow  are they going to maintain themselves during the\r\n\r\nduration  of  the  strike  and  their  activities  in\r\n\r\nconnection with the strike?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Naval Base Union, the Government\r\n\r\ntook action to freeze the funds of the union when the\r\n\r\nstrike  broke out. All the banks were instructed  not\r\n\r\nto  meet any payment on their behalf. As a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's action, the strikers met with  many\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  There are other cases.  There  is  the\r\n\r\nexample  of  the Singapore Business Houses Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion.  Strike action was taken by some  branches  of\r\n\r\nthis  union.  Action was taken by the  Government  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  their  funds. They therefore  faced  similar\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister is given these dictatorial powers,\r\n\r\nthen  the workers will face difficulties in the event\r\n\r\nof  a  strike.  In fact, these powers will  give  the\r\n\r\nMinister   many  opportunities  to   break   up   the\r\n\r\nlegitimate strikes of non-P.A.P. unions. This  is  my\r\n\r\nfirst point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to draw your attention to\r\n\r\nis  this. If the workers wish to support the  strikes\r\n\r\nof  other  unions,  that is, by giving  material  and\r\n\r\nfinancial aid, the Government can, by virtue of these\r\n\r\nprovisions in the Bill, abuse their power and  freeze\r\n\r\nthe  unions'  funds. These provisions  are  meant  to\r\n\r\nprevent certain unions from making use of their funds\r\n\r\nto  assist other unions and other workers who are  on\r\n\r\nstrike. Apart from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  point, if such dictatorial powers are given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister,  then,  in the  event  of  the  unions\r\n\r\ndesirous  of expanding their activities, and  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister does not like certain unions to expand their\r\n\r\nactivities,  he  will  again  resort  to  the  powers\r\n\r\ncontained in this Bill to freeze the union funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> On a point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is one clause which deals with\r\n\r\nthe  point, and the debate is on that clause.  Though\r\n\r\nhe is using the same expression, he is using it in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent context and using different reasons. I rule\r\n\r\nthat he is in order. Please proceed, Mr Chia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister can\r\n\r\neven   go  to  the  extent  of  abusing  his  powers,\r\n\r\ncontained  in this Bill, to threaten certain  unions.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, if the Minister does not want certain\r\n\r\nunions  to carry out certain activities in the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement, then he will again  take  action  to\r\n\r\nfreeze  the  trade  union funds.  Even  when  certain\r\n\r\nunions want to carry out legitimate activities  of  a\r\n\r\ncultural  nature or, in other respects, to raise  the\r\n\r\ncultural standard of the workers and make use of  the\r\n\r\nunion  funds for publication purposes, if the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndesire  to  stop the activities of these unions,  the\r\n\r\nMinister again can freeze the union funds in order to\r\n\r\nprevent  such activities from being carried  out.  If\r\n\r\nthese undemocratic powers of a dictatorial nature are\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  Minister, then we can  see  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will, by way of this Bill, take action against\r\n\r\nthose non-P.A.P. unions and drive their members  over\r\n\r\nto  the  other side, namely, the side of the  P.A.P.-controlled  trade unions. So since  the  P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nfailed to control the non-P.A.P. unions, they are now\r\n\r\nresorting to legal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeans  to further suppress them. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nalways claim that these unions are indulging in  open\r\n\r\nfront Communist activities, and so it is necessary to\r\n\r\nhave  this  Bill to take action against such  unions.\r\n\r\nBut let us look at the facts. This is a document from\r\n\r\nthe   Malayan  Trades  Union  Congress.   After   the\r\n\r\nCommittee  came to Singapore for a survey, they  came\r\n\r\nto this conclusion as contained in this document:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Singapore Government always make use of the\r\n\r\nState machinery and other governmental facilities  to\r\n\r\nhelp the National Trades Union Congress in Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  neglect those other unions which do not  endorse\r\n\r\nthe Government policies.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point has been admitted by the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour.  In this memorandum the Malayan Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress  officials continue to say that those  trade\r\n\r\nunions  which  do not endorse the P.A.P. Government's\r\n\r\nlabour policies always have their leaders intimidated\r\n\r\non  all  sorts of excuses and harassed unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nSuch  excuses like anti-national elements, open-front\r\n\r\nCommunist workers and the rest are common expressions\r\n\r\nused  by  the  Government against them. This  is  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  arrived  at  by a  third  party  from  an\r\n\r\nobjective  point  of  view. So  the  so-called  \"pro-Communist\"  and  \"anti-national  elements\"  are   but\r\n\r\nexpressions  used  by the P.A.P. against  non-P.A.P.-controlled trade unions if the P.A.P. fail  in  other\r\n\r\nways  to  deal with them. If the P.A.P. fail to  gain\r\n\r\ntheir  support  by legitimate means, they  will  turn\r\n\r\nround to brand them as Communist controlled and  take\r\n\r\naction against them. This again is another example to\r\n\r\nshow how one can give a dog a bad name and hang him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill there is also a provision stipulating\r\n\r\nthat   the  Minister  can,  in  the  event   of   the\r\n\r\ndissolution of a trade union, direct that  the  funds\r\n\r\nbe  put into the Consolidated Fund of the Government.\r\n\r\nAs  we  have already said, the funds of a trade union\r\n\r\ncome  from the workers by the accumulation  of  their\r\n\r\nsubscriptions over years. The workers  have  to  work\r\n\r\nvery  hard  to build up their own funds to  safeguard\r\n\r\ntheir  rights  and to enable them to  have  financial\r\n\r\nmeans to carry out their trade union activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim Heng) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how these funds should be used should be decided\r\n\r\nby  the  workers  themselves. In  the  event  of  the\r\n\r\ndissolution of any union, the members of  that  union\r\n\r\nmay desire that the funds be used for the welfare  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers. Therefore, the disposal of  such  funds\r\n\r\nshould be in accordance with the trade union rules or\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  desire  of  the  members  of  the\r\n\r\ndissolved union. It is not proper for the Minister to\r\n\r\ndirect  that the funds of that union be put into  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund, thereby depriving the  members  of\r\n\r\nthat union of their legitimate rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that even in the Federation of Malaya or\r\n\r\neven  in  England, trade union laws do not  have  the\r\n\r\nprovision  whereby trade union funds can be  forcibly\r\n\r\nput  into  the  Consolidated Fund, which  amounts  to\r\n\r\nconfiscation in the event of the dissolution  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this amending Bill, there is also another\r\n\r\nprovision whereby the Minister's direction  that  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union  funds can be put into the  Consolidated\r\n\r\nFund  will have retrospective effect to the  11th  of\r\n\r\nDecember,  1963.  Now  this provision  is  even  more\r\n\r\nunreasonable. According to the present  Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance, before the Government can freeze the funds\r\n\r\nof  any  trade union, an injunction should be applied\r\n\r\nfor in the High Court of Singapore. That is according\r\n\r\nto  the  present Trade Unions Ordinance. But  in  the\r\n\r\npast,  when the Government froze the funds  of  seven\r\n\r\nunions  of  the  S.A.T.U. group, the Government  used\r\n\r\nillegal  means  in  freezing  their  funds.  Now  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  trying to pass a  Bill  to  legalise\r\n\r\ntheir illegal acts in the past. For example, recently\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union wished\r\n\r\nto make use of the union funds in the bank. According\r\n\r\nto  their  rules,  the  funds in  the  event  of  the\r\n\r\ndissolution of the unions should be distributed among\r\n\r\nthe  members. Now the Government are trying  to  race\r\n\r\nagainst  time to pass this Bill in order  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe members of this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunion from having a share in the union's funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any law is to be given retrospective effect, it\r\n\r\nis  improper,  and it is even more  improper  if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. should  try  to make  use  of  this  Bill  to\r\n\r\nlegalise  their  illegal acts in  the  past.  Now  if\r\n\r\nlegislation is to serve the interests of the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthen  the  P.A.P. can make laws and break laws.  Then\r\n\r\nwhere  is  democracy? Where is the rule  of  law?  We\r\n\r\nfind,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker, that this  Trade  Unions\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill  is  a Bill  unprecedented  in  the\r\n\r\nhistory of the trade union movement in Singapore.  It\r\n\r\nis  a most undemocratic and dictatorial Bill. If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should force through this Bill,  then  we\r\n\r\nmust  condemn them strongly and they should  be  held\r\n\r\nresponsible for any consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  looking at this Trade Unions (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  as  a piece of legislation, and as a  piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation,  I see three objectionable  features  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Bill is made retrospective to be\r\n\r\napplicable  to  unions which were being  closed  down\r\n\r\nbefore this Bill has been discussed or passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, any democratic\r\n\r\ngovernment  recognises as a fact  that  retrospective\r\n\r\nlegislation is a very bad thing. As far as I know, in\r\n\r\nother  democratic  countries no government  has  ever\r\n\r\nattempted   to   try   to   introduce   retrospective\r\n\r\nlegislation because, if once the door is  opened,  we\r\n\r\nwill  not know where we stand tomorrow. For instance,\r\n\r\ntoday we have freedom of speech in this Assembly, but\r\n\r\ntomorrow  we  may not have it here. The  speeches  we\r\n\r\nmake  before such a Bill is passed can also  be  made\r\n\r\neffective retrospectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the second objectionable\r\n\r\nfeature  of this Bill is that the Minister will  have \r\n\r\nthe power to seize the funds of a union which he does \r\n\r\nnot  approve. Now when a member joins an association, \r\n\r\nhe  is  like a shareholder buying shares in a  public \r\n\r\ncompany. May I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstate,  for  instance, a public company is mismanaged\r\n\r\nor  some  of  its officials have misappropriated  the\r\n\r\nfunds  or  invested  them  in  contravention  of  the\r\n\r\nobjects of the company.

When a person becomes a member of a  union, \r\n\r\nor an association or a company, he has complete trust \r\n\r\nthat   the  articles  and  rules  approved   by   the \r\n\r\nGovernment will be carried out to the letter. Now  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  Bill  which will supersede all the  previous\r\n\r\nrules  and  constitutions approved by the Government,\r\n\r\nand it will enable the Government to seize control of\r\n\r\nthe funds of the members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, clause 4 which gives power to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  seize  union  funds  is  most \r\n\r\nobjectionable. If the Government have any  reason  to \r\n\r\nclose  down  a union - any reason that they  can  give -\r\n\r\nthe  funds  should  rightly go  back  to  the  union \r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third objectionable feature, Sir, is that this\r\n\r\nBill gives too much power to the Minister. My view is\r\n\r\nthat trade union funds rightly belong to the members.\r\n\r\nThe  Registrar  of Trade Unions has a legal  duty  to\r\n\r\ndischarge   to   see   that   the   funds   are   not\r\n\r\nmisappropriated  or misused by union  officials  and,\r\n\r\nfor  this  reason, the best way is to strengthen  the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Trade Unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of this Bill enables the Minister to act on\r\n\r\ninformation  given  to the Registrar.  The  Registrar\r\n\r\nmight  have  obtained  false  information.  You   may\r\n\r\nremember, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that at  one  time\r\n\r\nthere  was some false information about Tommy Koh,  a\r\n\r\nuniversity  student  who  was  supposed  to  be  with\r\n\r\nstudent  pickets, whereas he was actually in  Cameron\r\n\r\nHighands,  This sort of thing might happen again.  An\r\n\r\ninformer  might lodge a complaint with the  Registrar\r\n\r\nof  Trade  Unions that a meeting is to be held  on  a\r\n\r\ncertain  night  and  that the  union  funds  will  be\r\n\r\nappropriated.   The   Minister,   acting   on    this\r\n\r\ninformation, will immediately freeze the union funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is sufficient\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the  Penal Code to institute  criminal\r\n\r\nbreach   of  trust  proceedings  against  any   union\r\n\r\nofficial who misappropriates or misuses union funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I feel that this Trade Unions\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill should not be passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\na  little  while ago, the Member for Jurong raised  a\r\n\r\nhue  and cry over this Bill. We know why he has  made\r\n\r\nsuch   a  strong  protest  against  it.  Before   the\r\n\r\nelections,  the  Barisan had been  warned  that  once\r\n\r\nmerger took place, every step would be taken to check\r\n\r\nthe pro-Communists from manipulating the unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our object is to prevent them from using the unions and other civic organisations for activities which are inconsistent with our national interest. Their allegation that precautionary or whatever steps we take to checkmate them are detrimental to the workers is far from the\r\n\r\ntruth.  This is the very Bill that we are introducing\r\n\r\nin order to protect the interest of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will explain to this House how the pro-Communist\r\n\r\nelements  in  the unions manipulate  the  unions  and\r\n\r\nunion funds. I will dwell on this point later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at present the Trade Unions Ordinance  has  provision to deal with such  matters. But this is an old Ordinance which does not  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake provision to cope with the situation that we are\r\n\r\nfaced with at the moment - that is, the manipulation of\r\n\r\nthe  trade unions by the pro-Communists. If they  had\r\n\r\nbeen  honest and served the interest of the  workers,\r\n\r\nwe  would not have had to move this Bill to amend the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  this afternoon, in the present  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nthere  is  provision to say that in the  event  of  a\r\n\r\nunion   being   deregistered  by  the  Registrar   or\r\n\r\ndissolved on its own resolution, the assets and funds\r\n\r\nof  the union should be distributed according to  its\r\n\r\nrules  and constitution. If there are people who  are\r\n\r\ngenuinely looking after the interest of the  workers,\r\n\r\nthe   present  Ordinance  will  have  sufficed.  But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  we  have  an  unscrupulous  group  of\r\n\r\npersons who are manipulating the unions and they find\r\n\r\nways  and  means  to overcome the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, not only to exploit the workers  but  also\r\n\r\ntheir funds - as they say \"the sweat and blood of  the\r\n\r\nworkers\".  This  is exactly so, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir;  we  know that that is the workers' money  - from\r\n\r\nthe  sweat and blood of the workers. And we  want  to\r\n\r\npreserve it. That is the present position with regard\r\n\r\nto  the  Ordinance. When the three trade unions  were\r\n\r\nserved  with  notice of cancellation - mind  you,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, only a notice was served to  ask\r\n\r\nthem to show cause why the registration of the unions\r\n\r\nshould  be  cancelled; the Registrar  had  not  taken\r\n\r\naction yet, and they had ample time - two months' time\r\n\r\n- to  convince  and  satisfy  the  Registrar  why  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of the unions should not  be  cancelled\r\n\r\n- the  general election was around the corner  and  we\r\n\r\nhad  information that the people behind these  unions\r\n\r\nintended to withdraw large sums of money not for  use\r\n\r\nin the interest of the workers but in the interest of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan. Therefore, the Registrar  had  to  take\r\n\r\naction  to  preserve the workers'  money.  After  the\r\n\r\nelection,  that  is, after one month  of  the  notice\r\n\r\nserved  by the Registrar, the so-called officials  of\r\n\r\nthese unions with their legal adviser threatened  the\r\n\r\nbank  to  allow them to withdraw a sum of  money.  We\r\n\r\nwere  not  aware  of this until the  money  had  been\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  from the bank. Immediately  the  Registrar\r\n\r\ncame to know about this withdrawal, he wrote\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  letter to the unions and their legal adviser. They\r\n\r\nreplied  to say that this sum of money was  withdrawn\r\n\r\nto  pay  for  the  services  of  their  comrades  Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull,   Mr   Fong  Swee  Suan  and   Mr   Bani,\r\n\r\nimmediately the Registrar wrote to them that this was\r\n\r\nan  unlawful  use  of union funds.  Their  own  legal\r\n\r\nadviser  wrote back to admit that that was  unlawful.\r\n\r\nTherefore  we  told them, \"All right,  now  you  have\r\n\r\nwithdrawn this sum of money. Will you please  put  it\r\n\r\nback into the bank?\" But no, they still clung to that\r\n\r\nsum  of  money. But when the Registrar threatened  to\r\n\r\ntake  action  against the legal adviser, the  latter,\r\n\r\nprobably from his professional point of view, quickly\r\n\r\npassed   back  the  money  to  the  union  officials.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we had to chase after them for this sum of\r\n\r\nmoney.  Ultimately they went underground, the  minute\r\n\r\nbooks  and other things disappeared. For this reason,\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar was compelled to report the matter  to\r\n\r\nthe  police.  Anyway there will be  a  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry which will look into this matter. So  I  will\r\n\r\nnot go into details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is this, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, If\r\n\r\ntheir  argument is that while the notice  was  served\r\n\r\nthey  needed money to defray administrative expenses,\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  such hurry. They were asked  to  show\r\n\r\ncause within these two months why the registration of\r\n\r\nthe  unions should not be cancelled. If they had  any\r\n\r\nbill to pay, what they could do was to tell the shops\r\n\r\nor  any one who pressed for payment, \"All right,  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  has  seized our funds at  the  moment.  So\r\n\r\nduring  these two months, we will have to  await  the\r\n\r\ndecision as to whether the Registrar's notice will be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn - that is, no cancellation will be  effected\r\n\r\n- or  whether  the  registration  of  the  unions   is\r\n\r\ncancelled.\"  Even if the registration of  the  unions\r\n\r\nwas  cancelled ultimately, the bills could  still  be\r\n\r\npaid, because there was a rule to the effect that the\r\n\r\nunions  had  to  pay  for whatever  liabilities  they\r\n\r\nincurred. Therefore, the outstanding debts  could  be\r\n\r\npaid.  Therefore, there was no hurry  whatsoever  for\r\n\r\nthe  unions - especially these three unions that  were\r\n\r\nunder notice - to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthreaten  the  bank to allow them to  withdraw  large\r\n\r\nsums of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are the main causes that have motivated us to move this amending Bill so that the Registrar will have power to seize the funds of a union when it is served with a notice, otherwise the money of the workers will not be safeguarded, or it will disappear for some motives other than in the\r\n\r\ninterest of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has said that this is a\r\n\r\nrepressive law to obstruct the trade union  movement.\r\n\r\nMr Deputy Speaker, Sir, can he cite an instance? Can\r\n\r\nhe point out in what way the workers will be affected\r\n\r\nby this Bill? Of course, he has cited that in case  a\r\n\r\nunion  calls a strike it cannot withdraw  its  funds.\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, the words  used  here  are\r\n\r\n\"Where a notice has been given by the Registrar to  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union\". Now if a union has done nothing  wrong\r\n\r\nand has not been served with a notice, of course,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  affected by this Bill. So in what  way  will\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  affect  or  hinder  the  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nstruggle for better terms and conditions of service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he has mentioned that we have exercised\r\n\r\nour  power  to  freeze the funds of  the  Naval  Base\r\n\r\nWorkers' Union. That is not true. We have never  done\r\n\r\nthat. He has also mentioned that this amendment  will\r\n\r\naffect  the  unions  in  their  expansion  of   union\r\n\r\nbranches  and in promoting cultural activities.  That\r\n\r\nis  untrue.  Any  union can expand its  branches  and\r\n\r\npromote activities, but this can only be done if  its\r\n\r\nconstitution provides for such activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also mention just now that even the Federation\r\n\r\nhave  no  such similar Ordinance. Again that  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue. At the moment, the Registrar of Trade Unions in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation has full power to make directions  on\r\n\r\nthe  use of union funds when a union is under notice.\r\n\r\nOf  course, they say that this is a dictatorial piece\r\n\r\nof  legislation because the Minister can exercise his\r\n\r\ndiscretion. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in clause  4  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill which proposes the new section 18A,  it  is\r\n\r\nprovided that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Upon the dissolution of a trade union under the\r\n\r\nprovisions of section 18 of this Ordinance -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the property of the trade union shall\r\n\r\nforthwith  vest  in  the Official  Assignee  in\r\n\r\nBankruptcy;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>When  this Bill is passed, the position will be  that\r\n\r\nas  soon as a union is dissolved either by itself  or\r\n\r\nby  cancellation by the Registrar, whatever  property\r\n\r\nthat  union  possesses  must  vest  in  the  Official\r\n\r\nAssignee. The reason why we want this is that we have\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  persons in these seven cancelled  trade\r\n\r\nunions, and only through this provision can we remove\r\n\r\nthem  from the possession of workers' property.  Once\r\n\r\nthe   Official  Assignee  takes  possession  of   the\r\n\r\nproperly,  what does he do? There are two  provisions\r\n\r\nthere:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(b) the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy shall\r\n\r\nproceed to wind up the affairs of the trade union and\r\n\r\nafter  satisfying  and providing for  all  debts  and\r\n\r\nliabilities  of  the trade union  and  the  costs  of\r\n\r\nwinding  up shall pay the surplus assets, if any,  of\r\n\r\nthe trade union -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) where the Minister so directs, into the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) in the absence of a direction from the\r\n\r\nMinister, in accordance with the rules  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade union.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are two provisions\r\n\r\nhere.  The Member for Hong Lim mentions that this  is\r\n\r\ndictatorial  and  that  the Minister  can  abuse  his\r\n\r\npower.  Provision  18A (b)  (i)  is  made  because,  in\r\n\r\ncertain  cases, the situation may be such that  there\r\n\r\nis  no  record as to how the funds can be fairly  and\r\n\r\njustly  distributed to all the members who belong  to\r\n\r\nthat union. In those circumstances, then probably the\r\n\r\nMinister may have to exercise his discretion  to  pay\r\n\r\nthat  money back into the State. The money goes  into\r\n\r\nthe Consolidated Fund and into the State; it does not\r\n\r\ngo to anyone else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second provision there, 18A (b) (ii) , the\r\n\r\nmoney can be distributed in accordance with the rules\r\n\r\nof   the   trade  union.  Therefore,  where  is   the\r\n\r\ndictatorial power that the Minister will assume  with\r\n\r\nthe  so-called provision where the Minister will  act\r\n\r\naccording  to  his  whims  and  fancies?  All   these\r\n\r\nallegations are untrue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just now the Member for Hong Lim has mentioned the retrospective effect of this Bill. Due to the inadequate provision of the present Ordinance, in the past few years there were many unions which were dissolved or cancelled for not properly distributing the funds to the workers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order that this matter can be  settled,\r\n\r\nwe  take  this opportunity to incorporate it in  this\r\n\r\namending Bill, so that provision can be made for  all\r\n\r\nsuch  matters to be disposed of according to the law.\r\n\r\nSo  whatever  money  is due to the  workers  will  be\r\n\r\naccordingly returned to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all this roughly rebuts the criticisms that have been made against this Bill. But I think the Member for Jurong has made his allegations not because this amending Bill is going to hurt the workers' movement but rather it is going to hurt the anti-national movement. Therefore, it is\r\n\r\ntheir  business  and  not  a  matter  for  us  to  be\r\n\r\nconcerned with. What we are concerned with is to  see\r\n\r\nthat  whatever money is due to the workers should  be\r\n\r\nfairly  and justly returned to them. That is  why  we\r\n\r\nhave introduced this amending Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, my colleague the Member for Jurong  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  this  Trade Unions  (Amendment)  Bill  is\r\n\r\nintroduced by the P.A.P. for various purposes. One of\r\n\r\nthe  purposes is to legalise their illegal acts  done\r\n\r\nin the past.

This  is  a  new\r\n\r\nkind  of democracy of the P.A.P. It is a most serious\r\n\r\nblemish  on democracy. This amending Bill  smacks  of\r\n\r\nFascism and dictatorship. They say that the intention\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill  is to prevent the activities  of  pro-Communist  trade unions from being carried  out.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  they actually have in mind is to turn all  non-P.A.P. trade unions into pro-Communist  unions.  Can\r\n\r\nthey  legally prove that these trade unions are  pro-Communist or Communist organisations? You can  accuse\r\n\r\nanybody  of being a Communist or a running  dog,  but\r\n\r\nwhere is the legal evidence? None at all; they cannot\r\n\r\nadvance any evidence to prove their allegations. What\r\n\r\nthey can do is to produce this Bill here so that they\r\n\r\ncan  have the power to control all trade unions which\r\n\r\nare non-P.A.P. and to eradicate or wipe out all those\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  which  do not support  them.

This  kind  of action  is  very  serious\r\n\r\nindeed, because the P.A.P. are abusing their majority\r\n\r\nposition in this House to give themselves dictatorial\r\n\r\npowers.  This action of theirs smacks of Fascism  and\r\n\r\ndictatorship.  They  claim that  the  people  elected\r\n\r\nthem.  But  the  people  did not  elect  them  to  be\r\n\r\ndictators. The people will never condone their desire\r\n\r\nfor  dictatorial powers. The people did not give them\r\n\r\nthe  power to do whatever they like when they elected\r\n\r\nthem.  I  would  say  that the introduction  of  this\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Bill  will  brand them in the  end  as  anti-Communists. They call us traitors. But this Bill will\r\n\r\nfinally  land them in a position where they  will  be\r\n\r\nthe traitors. It is full of Fascist ideologies. If it\r\n\r\nis approved and implemented, we will see more Fascist\r\n\r\nmethods  being employed by the P.A.P. in the  future.\r\n\r\nThey  will  be able to deal with all the people  whom\r\n\r\nthey do not like. Will this be good for the people in\r\n\r\nthe  end?  It  will only endanger the rights  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  In the end the rights of the people will  be\r\n\r\nundermined.  I hope the P.A.P. will not make  use  of\r\n\r\ntheir  majority position in this House to abuse their\r\n\r\npowers. If they abuse their powers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  in  the end it will not only be detrimental  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  but  also to the P.A.P. themselves.  The\r\n\r\nBill  gives  very  wide powers  to  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\ncontrol and take action against those unions which do\r\n\r\nnot belong to the P.A.P. The Ministers and the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave shown in the past that they can make use of  the\r\n\r\nlaw to deal with people whom they do not like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, when this Bill is passed, it will\r\n\r\nprovide  them  with further powers  to  take  further\r\n\r\nrepressive  actions against the workers.  The  powers\r\n\r\nwill enable them to do more things detrimental to the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Member for Bras Basah will examine this\r\n\r\nBill  in  a  democratic spirit,  dispassionately  and\r\n\r\nobjectively. I also hope that Members of  this  House\r\n\r\nwho are not P.A.P. Ministers will look into this Bill\r\n\r\nobjectively. They will find that it will  hinder  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  trade  unionism and democracy.  With  the\r\n\r\npassing  of  this Bill, a non-P.A.P. Government  will\r\n\r\nalso  follow  suit.  This will be  a  great  blow  to\r\n\r\ndemocracy. The P.A.P. have been smearing those  trade\r\n\r\nunions  which  have been banned and closed  by  them.\r\n\r\nThey have accused them of misusing the unions' funds.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to ask a question. To whom  do  these\r\n\r\nfunds  belong? The answer is that they belong to  the\r\n\r\nworkers who are members of trade unions. The question\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  the funds of the unions  have  been\r\n\r\nmisused should be left to the workers to decide.  The\r\n\r\ndecision  should not be made by the P.A.P. oligarchy.\r\n\r\nWhat  right have they to say that the funds have been\r\n\r\nmisused when the workers themselves do not think  so?\r\n\r\nAre  they  the  office-bearers of the  trade  unions?\r\n\r\nTherefore, the P.A.P. is not the arbiter or the judge\r\n\r\nto   decide  whether  trade  union  funds  have  been\r\n\r\nmisused.  The  arbiter should be the members  of  the\r\n\r\nunions themselves. The workers and the office-bearers\r\n\r\nhave  all along been members of the unions from their\r\n\r\ninception  up  to  the  time  when  the  unions   are\r\n\r\ndissolved.   They   have   never   expressed    their\r\n\r\ndisapproval of the activities of the trade unions and\r\n\r\nthe  guidance  of  their  leaders.  This  shows  that\r\n\r\nwhatever actions that have been taken in the past  by\r\n\r\nthe leaders have had the approval\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  workers and members of the unions concerned.\r\n\r\nThis  also  shows  that  the members  of  the  unions\r\n\r\nconcerned  supported them. The Minister  has  alleged\r\n\r\nthat the leaders of the unions have been misusing the\r\n\r\nfunds  of trade unions. How could he convince  others\r\n\r\nof this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  you  will  agree  that  whenever  a  piece   of\r\n\r\nlegislation is introduced in this House, it is always\r\n\r\nintended  to  protect the good citizens and  not  the\r\n\r\nculprits. If the S.A.T.U.-controlled trade unions are\r\n\r\nstraightforward  and  make use  of  their  money  not\r\n\r\ninconsistent with trade union activities, there is no\r\n\r\nneed  for  them to be afraid of any legislation  that\r\n\r\nwill be passed here. Therefore, why should they raise\r\n\r\nstrong  objections  to  this  Bill?  They  must  have\r\n\r\nsomething at the back of their minds. They are afraid\r\n\r\nlegislation can stop these people from making use  of\r\n\r\ntheir    money   to   further   their   anti-national\r\n\r\nactivities. That is the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Jurong is more a teacher\r\n\r\nthan  a  trade  unionist. He says  that  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nTrades  Union Congress in the Federation have made  a\r\n\r\nreport  on  their  investigation of the  trade  union\r\n\r\nsituation in Singapore. But, on the other hand, he is\r\n\r\nignorant  of  the real facts concerning the  M.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nteam  that  has come to Singapore to investigate  the\r\n\r\ntrade union situation here. In fact, the M.T.U.C. in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation cannot even take part  in  any  trade\r\n\r\nunion  activity for the simple reason that it is  not\r\n\r\nregistered  under the Trade Unions Ordinance.  It  is\r\n\r\nregistered  under  the Societies  Ordinance.  So  the\r\n\r\nMember of the Opposition is ignorant when he tries to\r\n\r\nbring  in the stature of the M.T.U.C. and compare  it\r\n\r\nwith the trade union situation in Singapore, which is\r\n\r\nquite irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in a democratic country it is\r\n\r\nnothing  unusual for the people to criticise  the Government. \r\n\r\nBut whenever the Barisan Sosialis make  a criticism, they \r\n\r\nalways do it out of point. The reason why  I say they \r\n\r\ndo it out of point is this. They have even mentioned \r\n\r\nthat the funds of the Naval Base Union\r\n\r\nwere frozen. I think the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  knows that the Naval Base Union's funds  have\r\n\r\nnever been frozen. He is making use of this House  to\r\n\r\npublicise  this  statement so that  the  public  will\r\n\r\ncome  to  know  that they are the champions  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, I am giving my personal views on this\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions  (Amendment) Bill. In the first  place,\r\n\r\nlet me deal with the intentions of the Government and\r\n\r\nthe  grounds  on  which this Bill are  tabled.  Their\r\n\r\ngrounds can be classified in three categories. In the\r\n\r\nfirst place, they are tabling this Bill because  they\r\n\r\nwant to take action against those so-called Communist-controlled trade unions. Their claim that the  unions\r\n\r\nare Communist-controlled is most unconvincing. Nobody\r\n\r\nwill  ever  believe  what they  say  about  Communist\r\n\r\nactivities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason which they have put forward to\r\n\r\njustify  this  Bill is this. There  are  many  unions\r\n\r\nwhich   do  not  come  under  P.A.P. control.  Their\r\n\r\nmembership  is  strong. These unions  will  not  take\r\n\r\ninstructions   from  the  P.A.P.  The   P.A.P. are,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  introducing this piece of legislation  in\r\n\r\norder to control these disobedient unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason they have given to justify the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the  Bill is this.  They  say  some\r\n\r\nunions  are responsible for the industrial unrest  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Therefore,  the   Government   want   to\r\n\r\nconsolidate their control over the unions in order to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the workers. The Government want  power  to\r\n\r\ndirect  trade  union officials to make their  workers\r\n\r\nobedient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the reasons they have put forward to\r\n\r\njustify  the introduction of this Bill. To put  in  a\r\n\r\nnutshell. The P.A.P. are contemplating action against\r\n\r\nall  those  trade unions which do not obey  them  and\r\n\r\nwhich  refuse to allow themselves to be under  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncontrol.  Why should the P.A.P. do such a  thing?  My\r\n\r\nview is that the P.A.P. is a discredited Party in the\r\n\r\neyes of the workers in Singapore. It is difficult for\r\n\r\nthem to get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   support  and  confidence  of  the  workers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a result of their bad reputation.  They\r\n\r\nhave already failed in gaining the confidence of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  because they have never given any assistance\r\n\r\nto the workers in their struggle for their legitimate\r\n\r\nrights and their betterment. They have already failed\r\n\r\nin  the open confrontation and open argument. That is\r\n\r\nwhy  they are amending the trade union laws to  their\r\n\r\nown advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to draw your attention to\r\n\r\nis   that  the  Government  try  to  cover   up   the\r\n\r\nshortcomings of their anti-labour policies. They want\r\n\r\nto  control  all unions and all the workers  and  put\r\n\r\nthem in servitude. But they have already failed in so\r\n\r\ndoing. So to strengthen their position, they have  to\r\n\r\nfind some ways and means and they have found them  in\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of this Bill. The  failure  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  labour  policies  is  known  to  everybody.\r\n\r\nTherefore, where there is the existence of non-P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntrade  unions, the N.T.U.C. cannot survive. In places\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are  workers  belonging  to  non-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunions, the N.T.U.C. can never find a way in. That is\r\n\r\nwhy  the P.A.P. want to have this Bill to protect the\r\n\r\nlife and the existence of the N.T.U.C. They cannot do\r\n\r\nso  in open competition, so they resort to some legal\r\n\r\nmeans  to gain control over the non-P.A.P. unions  in\r\n\r\norder to promote and strengthen the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the P.A.P. desire to\r\n\r\nfurther persecute the workers and the broad masses of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  In the past, many trade  union  leaders\r\n\r\nwere  arrested, workers were assaulted  and  yet  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. would not stop at that. They now realise  that\r\n\r\nthese  repressive actions of assault will never  lead\r\n\r\nthem  anywhere.  So  they put on  the  mask  of  open\r\n\r\nargument and legal facade. That is why you have  this\r\n\r\nBill.  But this Bill is a very clear indication  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  are wearing a mask  of  trade  union\r\n\r\ndemocracy in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Minister for Finance is particularly interested \r\n\r\nin foreign capitalists. He has said on many occasions that the  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrikes  of  the  Singapore workers threaten  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment in Singapore.

Since  you\r\n\r\ndo  not want me to go further into the background,  I\r\n\r\nshall not go further into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill has been introduced because some unions in the S.A.T.U. group were given notice to show cause why their registration should not be cancelled. These unions were not able to give satisfactory reasons. Also some of them have withdrawn some money from\r\n\r\ntheir   banks.   In  view  of  this  situation,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  introduced this Bill  in  order  to\r\n\r\nexercise  some  control over the  non-P.A.P. unions.\r\n\r\nThis is going to give some undemocratic powers to the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Trade Unions against non-P.A.P.  unions.\r\n\r\nThe  position  is  this.  Instead  of  the  Registrar\r\n\r\ntelling  the world how wrong these unions  are,  they\r\n\r\nwant  them to show cause why they are right. In other\r\n\r\nwords,  \"I want to kill you\" instead of \"I am telling\r\n\r\nyou  and  showing the world that you are guilty.  You\r\n\r\nhave  to tell me why you should not be killed.\"  This\r\n\r\nis  the  position. This is not in any  way  different\r\n\r\nfrom   the   methods  of  dictatorship  and   Fascist\r\n\r\ncountries.  If  any of the unions  belonging  to  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. group has acted against the trade union laws\r\n\r\nor any laws existing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  it can be prosecuted and  charged  in\r\n\r\ncourt.

He said that some  unions\r\n\r\nhad  undesirable objectives in the administration  of\r\n\r\nthe  union  funds.  But  as a representative  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  I  have to speak in defence of these  unions\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been wronged and against which  wrongful\r\n\r\naccusations  have been made. This is a decision  made\r\n\r\nby   the   Minister.  If  you  want  to   shift   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the Cabinet, then I  will  say  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Cabinet have undesirable motives in  freezing\r\n\r\nthe  trade union funds and in tabling this Bill.  You\r\n\r\nwant  to  deprive certain unions of their  funds  and\r\n\r\nthen  you  turn round and say that these unions  have\r\n\r\nulterior  motives. It is just like a thief telling  a\r\n\r\nrich  man,  \"You have plenty of money  and  you  have\r\n\r\nundesirable motives in making use of your  money.  So\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  reason why I shall  rob  you  of  your\r\n\r\nmoney.\"  This is precisely the analogy that  one  can\r\n\r\ndraw from this Bill. Trade union funds come from  the\r\n\r\nsweat  and  labour of the workers who are members  of\r\n\r\nthe  trade unions. So the funds should rightly belong\r\n\r\nto  the  members  themselves.  The  decision  on  the\r\n\r\ndisposal  of the funds should not be decided  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Cabinet. They should be decided by the workers\r\n\r\nthemselves. We ask whether the P.A.P. Cabinet is,  in\r\n\r\nsubstance,   the   same  as  the  Central   Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  of any trade union, so as to  be  able  to\r\n\r\ndecide  on the disposal of the trade union funds.  So\r\n\r\nthe  position  now  is that a thief  wishing  to  rob\r\n\r\nanother person of his money says that this person has\r\n\r\nundesirable intentions to use his money and make  use\r\n\r\nof this allegation as the reason to rob him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the gratuity paid to some of the unionists,\r\n\r\nthis  was  also  a reason given by the Government  to\r\n\r\njustify  the introduction of the Bill. Regarding  the\r\n\r\ngratuity  payment by the union to  some  of  its  ex-officials, do you mean that the union has no right to\r\n\r\ndecide on this and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  should meet with condemnation from the P.A.P.?

The  Registrar wrote to the  union  officials\r\n\r\nasking  them to give reasons why they withdrew  money\r\n\r\nfrom  the  bank and for what purposes was  the  money\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.  The official of the S.G.E.U. listed  the\r\n\r\nreasons for the withdrawal. His reasons were (1)   the\r\n\r\nexecutive  committee  of  the  unions  had  passed  a\r\n\r\nresolution authorising the President, Vice-President,\r\n\r\nand Treasurer, to withdraw the money from the bank to\r\n\r\nbe  spent  as follows: $4,500 to be used as a  strike\r\n\r\nfund  to assist the striking workers; (2)  this  would\r\n\r\nenable them to have some means of livelihood, and (3) \r\n\r\nwould  prolong their struggle against oppression  and\r\n\r\nexploitation and to ensure victory. The workers  went\r\n\r\non  strike  because they are against the exploitation\r\n\r\nand  suppression of the employers. Is there  anything\r\n\r\nwrong with the manner in which the money was spent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nafraid  I  have to interrupt again.

I do not know why if  this\r\n\r\nBill  is  very important, it should be taken  through\r\n\r\nall   its  stages  so  hastily.  Why  is  this  being\r\n\r\nintroduced  at a time when certain trade unions  have\r\n\r\nalready withdrawn their funds from the bank, and also\r\n\r\nat  a  time when the Government have already admitted\r\n\r\nthat they have taken action in the past to freeze the\r\n\r\nunions' funds in the banks? Their action has not  the\r\n\r\nfull backing of the law. It is not easy to understand\r\n\r\nwhy,  in  introducing this urgent Bill in this  House\r\n\r\ntoday,  the P.A.P. should have given specious reasons\r\n\r\nto  cover  up  their real intention. I think  one  of\r\n\r\ntheir  intentions is to legalise their  past  actions\r\n\r\nwhich were illegal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the opinions of the Malayan\r\n\r\nTrades Union Congress which were reported in the  Sin\r\n\r\nChew  Jit Poh. From what the Government Benchers have\r\n\r\nsaid about this matter and also from what is reported\r\n\r\nin  the Sin Chew Jit Poh and other newspapers, we can\r\n\r\nsee  that  whatever the P.A.P. have done  has  caused\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction not only to the people and workers of\r\n\r\nSingapore  but also to the people and workers  across\r\n\r\nthe  Causeway. This is a fact which cannot be  denied\r\n\r\nby  anybody. The Member for Bras Basah may  deny  the\r\n\r\nimportant role of the M.T.U.C. But I would  say  that\r\n\r\nthe   M.T.U.C. has  a  large  membership   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  It occupies an important  place  in  the\r\n\r\nfield  of  trade unionism in Malaya.  We  should  not\r\n\r\noverlook  the  opinions which they have expressed  on\r\n\r\nthe situation of trade unionism in Singapore today. I\r\n\r\nwould like to refer to what the Member for Bras Basah\r\n\r\nhas  said  regarding the banning of trade unions  and\r\n\r\nother   actions   taken   against   them   and    his\r\n\r\njustification for them. All this goes  to  show  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have taken suppressive action against the\r\n\r\nworkers.  They are trying to ride over the  heads  of\r\n\r\nthe workers.

These\r\n\r\nare facts, and the people are afraid. So these people\r\n\r\nhave  a  guilty conscience that every move of  theirs\r\n\r\nwill  arouse suspicion on the part of the  people  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  because  of  their  past  acts.

Because their Bill has  some\r\n\r\nulterior motive, that is why they are interrupting to\r\n\r\ncover up this ulterior motive. They have taken action\r\n\r\nagainst  seven Left-wing trade unions which are  very\r\n\r\ninfluential  in  Singapore;  thinking  that  by  this\r\n\r\naction  against trade unions and their  leaders,  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of such unions will go over to the  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nand   be  controlled  by  them.  This  is  what   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  hope will happen. But in spite  of  these\r\n\r\nrepressive actions and arrests, the members of  these\r\n\r\nunions  are  still on their own side.  They  are  not\r\n\r\nallowing themselves to be exploited by the P.A.P.  So\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are  unable  to achieve  their  ulterior\r\n\r\nmotive.  Failing this, the P.A.P. are now introducing\r\n\r\nthis Bill which will give them another means by which\r\n\r\nthey  can  take  further  action  against  non-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, following the deregistration of some\r\n\r\ntrade  unions, the Government have even gone  a  step \r\n\r\nfurther  to  establish  the so-called  Commission  of \r\n\r\nInquiry  to look into the trade union funds of  these \r\n\r\nbanned trade unions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, why should the P.A.P. Government at\r\n\r\nthis   particular  moment,  not  earlier  or   later, \r\n\r\nestablish  a Commission of Inquiry? In the  meantime, \r\n\r\nthey introduce this Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir, they  are \r\n\r\ndoing  so  because they realise now  that  they  have \r\n\r\nacted  against  the  law. Because  in  the  past  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Trade Unions had no right to freeze  the\r\n\r\nfunds  of  trade unions in the bank. This is  usually\r\n\r\nthe behaviour of the Registrar of Trade Unions. So in\r\n\r\nso far as Singapore laws are concerned, the Registrar\r\n\r\nof  Trade  Unions has acted against the law,  legally\r\n\r\nspeaking.  Everybody knows now, as  admitted  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Trade Unions has no right under existing\r\n\r\nlaws to freeze trade union funds in the bank. So  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are  now  introducing this Bill  to  legalise\r\n\r\ntheir  illegal acts in having frozen the trade  union\r\n\r\nfunds in certain banks. But I want to tell them  that\r\n\r\nalthough the powers are in their hands they must  try\r\n\r\nto justify the use of their powers. They cannot abuse\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one other point to which I wish to draw your attention. That is, in introducing this Bill, the Government will be able to have the means to control trade unions in Singapore for a very long time to come. The P.A.P. will lay down certain lines and ask trade unions in Singapore\r\n\r\nto  follow them. If they do not, then action will  be\r\n\r\ntaken  against  them.  If trade unions  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nrefuse  to  go along the way laid down by the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthen the P.A.P. will take action against them. In the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. a  lot of leaders are trained according  to\r\n\r\nthe  ways  of the PAP. They are all going  along  the\r\n\r\npath of the P.A.P.

Their\r\n\r\nmain  intention  is to control all  non-P.A.P. trade\r\n\r\nunions  in  order  to win support  for  the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nfuture power thrust and power struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill, extensive powers are being given to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister who can make use of them to  deal  with\r\n\r\nany trade union which is not under the control of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in  order  to  ban it or  freeze  its  funds.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we say that this Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  very serious and undesirable intentions  against\r\n\r\nthe  workers, because by virtue of the powers of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  he  can  say that he is taking  action  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the law. His every action can then be\r\n\r\njustified  by  law. And the whole P.A.P. set-up  can\r\n\r\nclaim  that out country is under the rule of law,  so\r\n\r\nthey  are  doing things according to law. Under  such\r\n\r\npretext they can take action against all those  trade\r\n\r\nunions  which  are not in agreement with  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  I oppose this Trade Unions (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, this Bill will not meet with the support\r\n\r\nof  the  workers, because no workers or trade  unions\r\n\r\nhad  been  consulted before it was drafted.  I  would\r\n\r\npoint  out  that  before the Bill  was  drafted,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  have consulted  the  workers  and\r\n\r\ntrade unions concerned and invited their views. Since\r\n\r\nthis Bill will provide powers to freeze the funds  of\r\n\r\nthe trade unions, it is the duty of the Government to\r\n\r\nconsult  the trade unions to enable them  to  discuss\r\n\r\namong  themselves  and  to  help  the  Government  in\r\n\r\ndrafting a proper Bill by which the Minister will not\r\n\r\nbe  given  the opportunity of misusing the powers  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now read out what the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  has said about the Singapore Business  Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Surely the Member should not\r\n\r\ntake  out other unions' statements and read them  out\r\n\r\nin   this   Assembly.

We  have  not  been\r\n\r\nproperly  consulted and the Bill has been  circulated\r\n\r\nto  us  Only today. In such a hurry, how can we  have\r\n\r\nsufficient time to read the Bill and debate  upon  it\r\n\r\nin  this  House? This is most unreasonable action  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of the Minister. The Government  has  even\r\n\r\nasked us to pass the Bill today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I shoud like to read out a statement issued by\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Union is of the opinion that the Registrar's\r\n\r\naction  in giving notice to freeze the funds  of  the\r\n\r\nUnion  in the Bank is illegal, and the action  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  in this regard is also illegal. In our  letter\r\n\r\nof the 9th December, 1963, we already clearly pointed\r\n\r\nout that only the ex-members of this Union can have a\r\n\r\nshare in the funds, in accordance with section 18 (c) \r\n\r\nof  the  Trade Unions Ordinance and our  Trade  Union\r\n\r\nRules.  Thus, this fund should be divided  among  our\r\n\r\nmembers.  The  Government knows very  well  that  our\r\n\r\nreasoning has a concrete basis. All along our actions\r\n\r\nhave been legal. Now the Government is making use  of\r\n\r\nspecious  pretexts  to  take action  against  us,  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  oil a Certificate of Urgency  in  order  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  Minister or the Registrar  concerned  to\r\n\r\nhave the powers to deal with this matter,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  to  legalise  their past illegal  actions  with\r\n\r\nregard  to the freezing of funds and to give a  legal\r\n\r\nfacade to their actions. In actual fact, there is  no\r\n\r\nneed  for  the  introduction of this  amending  Bill,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  present  Trade  Unions  ordinance   can\r\n\r\nachieve  the  same  purposes. That Ordinance  already\r\n\r\nprovides the Minister with power to freeze the  funds\r\n\r\nof  a trade union in a bank. This implies that if the\r\n\r\nMinister  wishes, he can force the dissolution  of  a\r\n\r\nunion  and seize the money of the Singapore  Business\r\n\r\nHouses  Employees'  Union.  Judging  from  the   past\r\n\r\nactions  of the P.A.P., nobody is in doubt  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Consolidated Fund  is  no  more  than  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s fund.

First of all, the Minister for  Labour  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  acting properly in introducing this  Bill,\r\n\r\nbecause he has not given us ample time to read and to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  before we debate on this Bill and no support\r\n\r\nfrom the workers --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

The\r\n\r\nBill is also for the purpose of blinding the sight of\r\n\r\nthe  workers - to give the people a misconception. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. also  tried  to  mislead  the  public   into\r\n\r\nbelieving  that, because of a fraudulent act  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the leaders of the trade unions  concerned,\r\n\r\nthe funds of the trade unions have been frozen by the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  P.A.P. should not  think  that,  by\r\n\r\nusing  this pretext, they can get the support of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  from non-P.A.P. unions. It can never achieve\r\n\r\nthis. I can tell them that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should understand, first of all, how the trade unions and the funds of the trade unions came into being. These banned trade unions had a membership of more than 60,000 members. Had these unions' funds been misappropriated, how is it that there was $400,000 in the kitty? Had these unions'\r\n\r\nfunds  been misappropriated, they would not have  had\r\n\r\nthe  support of the workers, and they would not  have\r\n\r\nhad so much money by now. That they have such a large\r\n\r\nsum  of  money only goes to show that the  management\r\n\r\nhad been carried out properly and without any defect.\r\n\r\nHad  they  been misusing the $400,000, then today  we\r\n\r\nwould  not have been able to see the money any  more.\r\n\r\nThis  shows that they have not been squandering  away\r\n\r\nthe  money.  The Minister for Labour  says  that  the\r\n\r\nunion officials, when asked by the Registrar to  turn\r\n\r\nup  to  see  him, did not turn up. But  what  is  the\r\n\r\nactual  fact?  Is it a fact that, as claimed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour, these union officials dared  not\r\n\r\nturn  up  to see the Registrar? No. Because  we  know\r\n\r\nthat the Registrar of Trade Unions had an appointment\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsee the officials of the Singapore General Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion  at  10.00 a.m. on the 3rd December, 1963,  but\r\n\r\nthe  letter  was received by the union only  at  1.00\r\n\r\np.m. the same day because they had been to visit  the\r\n\r\nstrike  at some other place. Thus the letter was  not\r\n\r\nreceived  in  time.  But the  union  on  the  5th  of\r\n\r\nDecember went to see the Registrar. They intended  to\r\n\r\nsee the Registrar, but before that the police went to\r\n\r\nsearch  the residence of the leaders and their  union\r\n\r\npremises on the 4th December, 1963. These facts go to\r\n\r\nshow that the Minister for Labour has not been giving\r\n\r\nthe  full  facts  to  this House. Talking  about  the\r\n\r\n$13,500 union funds being withdrawn, I would say that\r\n\r\nthe  Executive  Committee of the union concerned  had\r\n\r\nthe full right under its union rules to decide on the\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  money and to withdraw it,  because  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Executive Committee had passed a  resolution\r\n\r\nto  that  effect. The money belonged to  the  workers\r\n\r\nbelonging to the unions, and was accumulated  by  the\r\n\r\nworkers through their toil and sweat. This fund  does\r\n\r\nnot  belong  to the P.A.P. It is not from the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nkitty  or from Government coffers. Since it  did  not\r\n\r\nbelong  to  anybody else, what was wrong  with  their\r\n\r\nwithdrawing the money and with their use of the money\r\n\r\non the workers themselves as decided by the Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say that the introduction of this Bill has been\r\n\r\ntoo  hasty.  If the Bill is passed too hastily  today\r\n\r\nthrough all the three Readings, I should say that  it\r\n\r\nis  most  unreasonable, because we all know that  the\r\n\r\nBill has very much to do with the future of the whole\r\n\r\nworking  population, touching on their interests  and\r\n\r\nwelfare from now hence. The Bill should not be  dealt\r\n\r\nwith in a haphazard way. It is most unreasonable  and\r\n\r\nabnormal.  We  the Opposition Members  had  not  been\r\n\r\ngiven sufficient time to read the Bill.

And we should not pass the  Bill  hastily without giving it proper time, or giving enough  time\r\n\r\nor  opportunity  to the people concerned  to  express\r\n\r\ntheir opinion. On behalf of the people concerned,  we\r\n\r\noppose  this  kind  of action of the  P.A.P.  If  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. would not like to look after the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  people,  the  general masses, the  workers,  and\r\n\r\nwould only look after its own interests, and want  to\r\n\r\nforce  through  this Bill today, then here  we  would\r\n\r\nlodge  the  strongest protest against the passing  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill. I say that if it is passed without  regard\r\n\r\nto  the opinion and the will of the trade unions,  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers concerned, we would lodge our  strongest\r\n\r\nprotest  against the Bill here in this  House.

So if you are not guilty of anything,  if\r\n\r\nyou  have  no  guilty conscience, why should  you  be\r\n\r\nafraid  of  people freezing your funds?  The  Members\r\n\r\nopposite  have stood up one after another  to  attack\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.  But  they are repeating  themselves  one\r\n\r\nafter   another.  They  have  called  us  \"Fascists\",\r\n\r\n\"dictatorial\" - these are all tunes being played  over\r\n\r\nand  over again, right from two years ago. There have\r\n\r\nbeen  no  changes in their argument.  They  are  only\r\n\r\ncapable  of  repeating  themselves  and  their   past\r\n\r\nleaders  in this House. One Hitler propaganda  expert\r\n\r\nsays  that  if  you repeat a lie one thousand  times,\r\n\r\nthen      you     may     be     able     to     convince\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nothers that it is the truth.

So  they  are\r\n\r\nactually   resorting  to  the   Fascist   method   of\r\n\r\npropaganda.  They say that the people  are  on  their\r\n\r\nside, they have the support of the broad masses,  the\r\n\r\nworkers and everybody, and that they have the support\r\n\r\nof  all  concerned all over the world  and  all  over\r\n\r\nSingapore. Now, is this really true? If they have the\r\n\r\nsupport  of the people in Singapore, how is  it  that\r\n\r\nthey were not able to win power in the elections?  So\r\n\r\nhow  can  they  explain  away  their  defeat  in  the\r\n\r\nelections? How can they deceive the people by  saying\r\n\r\nthat they have the support of the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.

But in any case,  we\r\n\r\ncan let that pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main idea of this Bill is to\r\n\r\nprotect  the interests and properties of the workers, \r\n\r\nand  to  protect the trade union funds so  that  such \r\n\r\nfunds  will  not be made use of by the  irresponsible \r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders by way of gifts  to  their  so-called \"union advisers\", their \"union leaders\".  This\r\n\r\nis an objective that we are trying to achieve through\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.  Now the behaviour of these irresponsible\r\n\r\ntrade  union leaders, as I have already said, amounts\r\n\r\nto  the act of workers' traitors. If they really have\r\n\r\nnothing  to hide, then where is the General Secretary\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore General Employees' Union? Why is he\r\n\r\nnot here to explain that he has withdrawn their money\r\n\r\nin  a legitimate manner? Why has he not explained how\r\n\r\nthe funds that he has withdrawn have been used? It is\r\n\r\nbecause they have done something wrong that they  are\r\n\r\nnow in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhiding. They are now trying to explain away the  fact\r\n\r\nthat they have done something wrong by saying that we\r\n\r\nin  the  Government desire to arrest  them.  Now  why\r\n\r\nshould they disappear so conveniently soon after  the\r\n\r\nfunds  were withdrawn? Why should they accuse  us  of\r\n\r\nhaving introduced this Bill when they themselves  are\r\n\r\nguilty  of  an illegal act? Of course, we agree  that\r\n\r\nthe  funds  of the workers should be decided  by  the\r\n\r\nworkers  themselves, but we must not,  on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, allow the so-called \"leaders of the workers\" to\r\n\r\ndecide on the use of the funds of the workers.  These\r\n\r\nso-called \"leaders\" tried to justify the use  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union  funds  withdrawn by  way  of  paying  a\r\n\r\n\"bonus\" to their so-called \"advisers\". But I want  to\r\n\r\nask  them, \"Did they consult the workers before  they\r\n\r\npaid  this  so-called \"bonus\" to the union  advisers?\r\n\r\nDid  they have the approval of the workers before the\r\n\r\npayment  was  made for the benefit of  the  so-called\r\n\r\n\"union advisers\"? No. They did not do so. They  never\r\n\r\nconsulted  the  workers.  This  decision  of   paying\r\n\r\n\"bonus\" to the \"leaders\" and \"advisers\" was made in a\r\n\r\nhurry by just a handful of them. That was during  the\r\n\r\nelection  time when a lot of money was  required  for\r\n\r\nelection   propaganda.  So  we  have  established   a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry to look into these funds having\r\n\r\nbeen  misused. I am sure the Report of the Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry  will give a full picture  of  how  these\r\n\r\nfunds were misused. A few moments ago the Member  for\r\n\r\nJurong said that, according to the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nBill,  there  are opportunities for the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nabuse his powers against the interests of the workers\r\n\r\nand  to  break  up strikes conducted in a  legitimate\r\n\r\nmanner, that he can even go a step further and  abuse\r\n\r\nhis  powers  to  restrict  certain  unions  that   he\r\n\r\ndislikes  from expanding their activities,  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government can misuse their power to freeze  the\r\n\r\nunions funds. But he should realise that these powers\r\n\r\nwill  not  be misused by the Government. The Minister\r\n\r\nwill  have  no  power  to freeze  trade  union  funds\r\n\r\naccording  to  his  whims and fancies.  According  to\r\n\r\nclause 2 of this Bill, section 15A reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where a notice has been given by the Registrar to\r\n\r\na  trade union under the provisions of subsection (2) \r\n\r\nof  section  15 of this Ordinance, the Minister  may,\r\n\r\nwhere  he  is  satisfied that it is likely  that  the\r\n\r\nfunds  of  the union may be misused, by order  direct\r\n\r\nany bank in Singapore not to pay any money out of nor\r\n\r\nto pay cheques drawn on the account of such union for\r\n\r\na specified period not exceeding three months.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  the conditions are, first, when a notice has been\r\n\r\ngiven  and, secondly, when the Minister is satisfied.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is not so easy for the Minister to abuse  his\r\n\r\npowers.  There is one prerequisite, and that  is  the\r\n\r\nnotice must be served first on the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new section 15A is very clear, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.  Before the Minister can exercise his powers  to\r\n\r\nfreeze the union's funds, a notice must be served  on\r\n\r\nthe union by the Registrar in accordance with section\r\n\r\n15  subsection (2)  of the Trade Unions  Ordinance  to\r\n\r\nshow  cause  why  its  registration  should  not   be\r\n\r\ncancelled. This is the prerequisite under  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister may only exercise his powers. It is  not  so\r\n\r\neasy  for  the  Minister to exercise his  powers,  as\r\n\r\nalleged by the Members opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another allegation is that we are trying to\r\n\r\nrush  through this Bill. But the fact is that  before\r\n\r\nwe  introduced this Bill in my Ministerial  statement\r\n\r\non  11th December, 1963, we indicated that a Bill  of\r\n\r\nthis  nature  would  be  tabled  and,  in  fact,   we\r\n\r\ndistributed  copies  of it to  Members  opposite  for\r\n\r\ntheir examination and study. So from 11th December up\r\n\r\nto  the present moment, the Members have had at least\r\n\r\none  week to enable them to go through the provisions\r\n\r\nof  this Bill. How can they say that no time has been\r\n\r\ngiven to them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong says that even the Malayan\r\n\r\nTrades Union Congress have accused us of having  made\r\n\r\nuse  of the State machinery against non-P.A.P. trade\r\n\r\nunions. I will say that this allegation is untrue. It\r\n\r\nis  not  necessarily true that trade unions which  do\r\n\r\nnot endorse P.A.P. views are not allowed to exist. We\r\n\r\ndeny  facilities to those unions which are controlled\r\n\r\nby  the  Communists.  As  long  as  a  union  is  not\r\n\r\ncontrolled by the Communists, then it will  be  given\r\n\r\nall  sorts of facilities to carry out its activities,\r\n\r\nwhether it is a P.A.P. union or a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-P.A.P. union.  We  only  deny  the   Communist-controlled trade unions similar facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also say that in the Federation of Malaya and\r\n\r\nother  countries there are no laws giving such powers\r\n\r\nto the Minister for Labour except in Singapore. But I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  refer  to  the  statement   by   my\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary with regard to the  power  to\r\n\r\nfreeze trade union funds. The power to freeze and  to\r\n\r\nput trade union funds into the Consolidated Fund also\r\n\r\nexists   in  the  Trade  Unions  Ordinance   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. If the Members opposite do  not\r\n\r\nknow this, then they should go and read the law books\r\n\r\nbefore they criticise us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that the introduction of this Bill is to\r\n\r\nlegalise  our illegal acts. But I wish to  point  out\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  loopholes in  the  Ordinance  which\r\n\r\nenable  irresponsible  trade  union  leaders  to  act\r\n\r\nagainst the interest of the workers. That is  why  we\r\n\r\nhad  to  introduce  this amending Bill  to  plug  the\r\n\r\nloopholes in our laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not our desire to destroy non. P.A.P. trade\r\n\r\nunions. All that we desire to destroy are the  unions\r\n\r\ncontrolled   by   the  Communists  and  anti-national\r\n\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that by introducing this Bill we will\r\n\r\nultimately  land  ourselves  into  the  position   of\r\n\r\ntraitors. But they are the thieves, and now they turn\r\n\r\nround  to  call other people thieves.  They  are  the\r\n\r\ntraitors,  and  they have got the cheek  to  call  us\r\n\r\ntraitors now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They maintain that the question of whether union\r\n\r\nfunds  are  misused or not should be decided  by  the\r\n\r\nworkers. But the point is, were the workers given the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  express their views against  Messrs.\r\n\r\nFong Swee Suan, Woodhull and Bani? No, they were  not\r\n\r\ngiven  the  chance  to do so. In  fact,  the  workers\r\n\r\nthemselves do not know how the union funds have  been\r\n\r\nused.  In addition to their salaries, the trade union\r\n\r\nleaders and so-called advisers are given $200 special\r\n\r\nallowance.  Do the union members know about  this?  I\r\n\r\nthink  there are other facts which have not  come  to\r\n\r\nlight and I hope the Commission of Inquiry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be able to bring them out into the open.  So  a\r\n\r\ngood show is coming this way!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim has also\r\n\r\nmentioned    a    few    points,    expressing    his \r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  with this Bill. He  says  that  this \r\n\r\nBill  has a retrospective effect. But I say that this \r\n\r\nretrospective effect is necessary because  the  funds \r\n\r\nof  some  unions which have already been deregistered\r\n\r\nin  the  past have not been disposed of. For example,\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of  the  Singapore  Shop  and  Factory\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union  which  was  declared  illegal,   and\r\n\r\nderegistered quite some time ago, the problem of  the\r\n\r\ndisposal of their assets has not been settled.  Their\r\n\r\nunion  premises  in Bukit Timah Road  have  not  been\r\n\r\ndisposed of. Now, how are these properties and assets\r\n\r\nof  the  unions to be disposed of? One of the objects\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill  is  to  provide a  solution  for  the\r\n\r\ndisposal of these unions' assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Opposition Members have also said that the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund is actually a P.A.P. fund. Now this\r\n\r\nis  a  big lie. The Consolidated Fund belongs to  our\r\n\r\ncountry, it  belongs to our people.  In  fact,  they\r\n\r\nspent a lot of time in the Budget debate to say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Consolidated Fund is a public fund and  that  we\r\n\r\nshould not abuse it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be appreciated that we have to withdraw\r\n\r\nfunds  from the Consolidated Fund to provide services\r\n\r\nfor  the  people. So there is nothing wrong,  in  the\r\n\r\nevent  that  trade union funds cannot be disposed  of\r\n\r\notherwise, to put them into the Consolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has also referred to the\r\n\r\nfact  that the Minister in charge has been given  too\r\n\r\nmuch  power. As I have said, this power can  only  be\r\n\r\nexercised under certain circumstances, that is, after\r\n\r\na  notice  has been served by the Registrar of  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  on  a  certain union. Before that  notice  is\r\n\r\nserved,  the Minister can never exercise  the  powers\r\n\r\nunder  this  Ordinance. So the arguments put  forward\r\n\r\ncannot hold water. They say that the workers and  the\r\n\r\npeople  are  on their side. But why is it  that  they\r\n\r\nfailed in the elections?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

This accusation actually throws any government in a very unenviable position and no government worth its salt and having the confidence to govern would like to give room for\r\n\r\nthe  people  to  have doubts that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nusing such clauses to suppress the Opposition. It  is\r\n\r\nimportant, Sir, that the Government must not give any\r\n\r\ngrounds  for doubt, that the Government is using  its\r\n\r\npower to suppress the Opposition. Therefore, Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthe  powers were to be transferred from the  Minister\r\n\r\nto a High Court Judge, I think that would remove much\r\n\r\nof  the  odium  of  this undemocratic  Bill.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  with  this intention  that  I  move  this\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The amendments\r\n\r\nput  forward  by the Member for Hong  Lim  cannot  be\r\n\r\naccepted by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for his amendments is that the Minister\r\n\r\nmay abuse the powers given by this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Second Reading of this Bill, I have said\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister cannot freeze the  funds  of  any\r\n\r\ntrade  union until the Registrar of Trade Unions  has\r\n\r\nserved notice under section 15 subsection (2)  of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Before he does so, he cannot  freeze  the\r\n\r\nfunds of any trade union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nsuggests  that the Minister should be replaced  by  a\r\n\r\nHigh Court Judge.

There  is  a\r\n\r\nsimilar provision in the Federation trade union  laws\r\n\r\nand our provision is based on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the dispute is\r\n\r\nwhether this Assembly should observe the rule of  law\r\n\r\nor   accept  that  this  country  should  be  run  by\r\n\r\narbitrary  powers of the Government? Where  funds  of\r\n\r\nunions  are concerned and the future of union members\r\n\r\nis  at  stake,  I  feel  that  the  Minister  or  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  not  be given arbitrary  powers  to\r\n\r\ndecide  whether union funds should be frozen or  not,\r\n\r\nbut  that  the  Minister or his  representative,  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Trade Unions, should present a case  and\r\n\r\nwhether union funds should be frozen or not should be\r\n\r\ndecided  by  an  impartial  High  Court  Judge.   Mr\r\n\r\nChairman, Sir, that is the essence of my amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\npoint  mentioned by the Member for Hong  Lim  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  in the present Ordinance, but the difficulties\r\n\r\nwe   are  facing  are  this.  There  is  a  group  of\r\n\r\nunscrupulous   people  and  if  we  resort   to   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic procedure laid out in the present  section\r\n\r\nof  the  Ordinance, by the time we get an order  from\r\n\r\nthe  Court the union has already withdrawn the  funds\r\n\r\nand  the  money will have disappeared into  the  air.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why,  in  order to plug the  loophole,  the\r\n\r\ninadequacy  of  the provision, we have  therefore  to\r\n\r\namend it by this section here. But I think the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong  Lim has just moved the amendment  for  the\r\n\r\nsake  of  moving  it without looking into  the  whole\r\n\r\naspect of the Ordinance. In section 15A there are  so\r\n\r\nmany  provisions for the Registrar to satisfy himself\r\n\r\nbefore he can issue a notice to a trade union.  First\r\n\r\nof  all, there is a checkmate. The Registrar can only\r\n\r\nserve  a  notice on a union under certain  conditions\r\n\r\nwhich  are laid down in section l5A. Therefore, there\r\n\r\nis  no justification for the statement that this Bill\r\n\r\nis  trying to suppress the Opposition. What  we  want\r\n\r\nfrom  this  amending  Bill is that,  in  the  interim\r\n\r\nperiod where a notice has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen served on a union, if it is found that the union\r\n\r\nintends  to  withdraw money for purposes inconsistent\r\n\r\nwith its rules and objects, the Minister will have to\r\n\r\nexercise his discretion to withhold - he does not stop\r\n\r\nthe  money  - the money for three months  only.  After\r\n\r\nthat,  if the union is allowed to continue, then  the\r\n\r\nfrozen money will be released; or if registration  of\r\n\r\nthe union is cancelled, the money will be transferred\r\n\r\nto the Public Official Assignee. There is no question\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister holding the funds.  It  is  just  a\r\n\r\ncheckmate during the interim period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I do\r\n\r\nunderstand  it is to freeze the union's  account  for\r\n\r\nthree  months, although this is a moratorium on union\r\n\r\nfunds  for three months. But, Sir, with three  months\r\n\r\nfunds  frozen,  the union will cease to  operate  for\r\n\r\nthose  three months. If the Government think that  it\r\n\r\nis  very  difficult to get a hearing  before  a  High\r\n\r\nCourt  Judge  -  and  I know of instances  where  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can get a High Court Judge to hear a  case\r\n\r\nwithin  one  or  two  days, I mean,  I  do  not  mind\r\n\r\namending it to a District Court Judge - either a  High\r\n\r\nCourt Judge or a District Court Judge but the essence\r\n\r\nof  the  amendment  is  this. Let  the  rule  of  law\r\n\r\nprevail.  Let  us have less arbitrary powers  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment exercising more and more control over  our\r\n\r\ndaily lives. That is all. If the Government think  it\r\n\r\nis  very difficult to get a High Court Judge to  hear\r\n\r\nsuch  a  case, I do not mind having a District  Court\r\n\r\nJudge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just to cut\r\n\r\nthe matter short, just one point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

If the \r\n\r\nGovernment  consider it necessary to close  down  the \r\n\r\nunions,  all  the funds should rightly be distributed \r\n\r\namong   the   members,   because   the   funds    are\r\n\r\nsubscriptions  or  donations  from  the  members  and\r\n\r\nshould  be returned to them, as is usually determined\r\n\r\nby  the  Official Assignee in bankruptcy cases  That,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  first  reason  for  the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason, as I have said earlier during\r\n\r\nthe Second Reading, is that it is very bad to make  a\r\n\r\nlaw  retrospective, and section 18B  makes  this  law\r\n\r\nretrospective and applicable to unions against  which\r\n\r\nthe  Government have taken action even before the law\r\n\r\nis passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is because of these two reasons\r\n\r\nthat I move these two amendments.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, the proposal made\r\n\r\nby the Member for Hong Lim negates the very principle\r\n\r\nof this Bill. Therefore, the Government cannot accept\r\n\r\nit.  There  is no question of misappropriating  union\r\n\r\nfunds,  because The Minister shall so direct only  in\r\n\r\nextreme  cases where the union membership  cannot  be\r\n\r\nestablished or where the members cannot be traced. It\r\n\r\nis  only  in  those extreme cases that the Government\r\n\r\nhave no choice but to direct these monies be put into\r\n\r\nthe  Consolidated Fund. The Consolidated Fund belongs\r\n\r\nto  the  people  of Singapore, and I cannot  see  any\r\n\r\npossibility of misappropriation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 18A paragraph (b) (ii) provides that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  dispose of the funds  in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith the rules of the union.

We  can see from his speech his  despondency\r\n\r\nand  evil intentions. There was nothing in his speech\r\n\r\nbut  smears, accusations and fairy tales. He put  all\r\n\r\nthe  blame on the Opposition side. His speech can  be\r\n\r\ndescribed as reflecting on the P.A.P. He defended the\r\n\r\nCentral Government for all the evils and failures the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have perpetrated in the past and for all  the\r\n\r\nrepressive  and oppressive actions carried  out  with\r\n\r\nthe  abetment of the P.A.P. on the people. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave defended themselves by putting the blame on  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government  for  the  arrest  of  the  trade\r\n\r\nunionists and other progressive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelements.  Today they use the same tactics;  tomorrow\r\n\r\nthey can also resort to the same game and tactics  on\r\n\r\nthe  people.  This  has  been their  usual  political\r\n\r\npractice. But I would like to advise them not to  put\r\n\r\nthe blame on the shoulders of others in order to show\r\n\r\nto the people that they are people of integrity and a\r\n\r\nParty of integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of policy in regard to the rural\r\n\r\nareas,  the P.A.P. have been following the same  past\r\n\r\npractice - shifting the blame for their failures on  to\r\n\r\nthe  shoulders of others. All the failures  in  their\r\n\r\nrural policy have been shifted on to the shoulders of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Parties and the  pro-masses  of  the\r\n\r\nrural  people. They have never thought  of  analysing\r\n\r\ntheir  failures  themselves or  realising  that  they\r\n\r\nthemselves  are to blame. They should  have  revealed\r\n\r\ntheir  own  mistakes but in His Excellency's  speech,\r\n\r\nnothing was mentioned about how the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\ncould  improve the lot and livelihood  of  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople.  The  P.A.P. have never started  anything  on\r\n\r\nconcrete grounds and have never paid attention to the\r\n\r\nrealities  existing at present. As in  the  past  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  have  been  making use  of  every  available\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  achieve their  political  propaganda\r\n\r\npurposes. For instance, the Ministers have been using\r\n\r\noccasions  when community centres were declared  open\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministers,  and using the  radio  and  other\r\n\r\navailable  opportunities  to  do  publicity  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   But  our  defeated  candidates  have   never\r\n\r\nresorted to these actions. Some of them are  in  gaol\r\n\r\nnow.  Further,  the Prime Minister is  now  going  on\r\n\r\nanother round of rural tours and is trying to  change\r\n\r\nthe  former Welcoming Committees of the areas,  where\r\n\r\nhe    toured,    into   the   so-called   Citizenship\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committees to help the Government  when\r\n\r\nthere are so many rural problems awaiting solution by\r\n\r\nthe  Government. Though these questions have not been\r\n\r\nsolved  by the Government and the needs of the  rural\r\n\r\npeople  have not been met, yet the Prime Minister  is\r\n\r\ndoing  something which will go to strengthen his  own\r\n\r\npolitical  power. There is a grave doubt whether  the\r\n\r\nadvice and opinions of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso-called  Permanent Citizens Consultative  Committee\r\n\r\nwill be listened to by the P.A.P. overlords. And  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. intend to extend the fields of its activities\r\n\r\nin  the  community centres. But the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhave  not  disclosed the details and  the  nature  of\r\n\r\nthese activities. Does it mean that the P.A.P. intend\r\n\r\nto  use  the  community  centres  as  clinics  or  as\r\n\r\nveterinary  stations  or  as offices  for  collecting\r\n\r\ncentres for property taxes, or are they to be used as\r\n\r\nP.A.P. propaganda stations? On the other hand, we see\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. are allotting $1 million to be  used\r\n\r\nfor  the  so-called training of leadership  to  serve\r\n\r\nP.A.P. purposes.  This  is  another  indication   of\r\n\r\ncollusion with the Minister for Culture. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance has also said that he would use most  of\r\n\r\nhis  time  to  deal  with the youths  of  some  other\r\n\r\nsections. That is the only method of policy he  could\r\n\r\nhave  in  dealing with State matters. This policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. can only create undesirable consequences\r\n\r\nin the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years the P.A.P. Government's\r\n\r\npolicy of suppression in the rural areas against  the\r\n\r\nrural people - this sort of activity of the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nfar  exceeded  the  good it has  done  to  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople, and the enthusiasm and efforts of the P.A.P., in\r\n\r\nhelping  the  foreign capitalists have  far  exceeded\r\n\r\ntheir efforts in helping the people themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrialisation policy of the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nanother  humbug.  It is a fact that the  P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nbeen  making  extensive use of  the  police  and  the\r\n\r\nmilitary   to   suppress  the  people   and   workers\r\n\r\ngenerally.  The P.A.P. have driven away over  100,000\r\n\r\npeople from their homesteads without giving them  any\r\n\r\nadequate  compensation  or  properly  solving   their\r\n\r\nresettlement  problems.  This  includes  Toa   Payoh,\r\n\r\nKallang,  Geylang  Serai,  Lorong  Meng  Kong,  Bagan\r\n\r\nMerah,  Aljunied, Potong Pasir, Bukit Linchik, Delta,\r\n\r\nLim  Chu  Kang,  Lamaji, Choa Chu Kang,  the  Geylang\r\n\r\nareas  and  various other places.  People  living  in\r\n\r\nthese  areas are all involved. From November of  last\r\n\r\nyear  up to this November, the P.A.P. have demolished\r\n\r\nmore  than  100  houses and destroyed  the  vegetable\r\n\r\nplots of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of rural problems, unpleasant\r\n\r\nincidents have always been caused by the bureaucratic\r\n\r\nand  unreasonable attitude and actions of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThey will never listen to the opinions and wishes  of\r\n\r\nthe people of the rural areas and the representatives\r\n\r\nof the people. They are following the line of the Lim\r\n\r\nYew Hock Government. They never consider the economic\r\n\r\nsituation of those people who are affected.  Do  they\r\n\r\nnot  know  that  many of the rural people  could  not\r\n\r\nafford  to  pay high rentals? Do they not  know  that\r\n\r\ncertain hawkers, after being forced to remove,  would\r\n\r\nbe short of finances to start their business anew? Do\r\n\r\nthey  not  know that certain workers, when  they  are\r\n\r\nforced  to  settle down in areas far away from  their\r\n\r\nplaces  of trade, experience great inconvenience  and\r\n\r\neconomic difficulty? Do they not know that the  costs\r\n\r\nof  agricultural products would also be  affected  by\r\n\r\nremoval?  There are also other problems such  as  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties and inconveniences caused  to  school-going  children who are resettled in outlying  areas.\r\n\r\nWe  should understand when the rural people are faced\r\n\r\nwith  enforced removal, they will suffer the loss  of\r\n\r\ntheir  wealth and other possessions and will be faced\r\n\r\nwith new unknown changes which will cause undesirable\r\n\r\npsychological effects and an unnecessary burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If their future livelihood and business could be\r\n\r\nassured  by the Government and if their psychological\r\n\r\nill-feelings  could be avoided, then I am  sure  that\r\n\r\nthey   would   be  quite  willing  to  be  resettled,\r\n\r\notherwise they would have no alternative but to react\r\n\r\nagainst  their  enforced removal  and  of  course  to\r\n\r\noppose  the  Government's  unreasonable  compensation\r\n\r\nrates.  All civic-minded citizens would also  demand,\r\n\r\non    their    behalf,   adequate   and    reasonable\r\n\r\ncompensation.

The Government should have planned\r\n\r\nto  make use of available land in our State. But have\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. been using State land?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the P.A.P.'s Master Plan? Let us use\r\n\r\nwhat the P.A.P. have said to rebut them. In 1959,  in\r\n\r\ntheir  election  pamphlets there is a passage  saying\r\n\r\nthat  the Master Plan drafted by the colonial  regime\r\n\r\ncould  only satisfy the greed of the great landlords,\r\n\r\nthat,  in actual fact, it was not beneficial  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  that it should be drawn up in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the practical needs of Singapore. Besides this,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. also condemned the compensation rates  of\r\n\r\nthe Lim Yew Hock Government. But when we look around,\r\n\r\nwe  can  see  that the P.A.P. are out in  full  force\r\n\r\nimplementing  the  same  Master  Plan  and  the  same\r\n\r\ncompensation  rates of the Lim Yew  Hock  Government.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   unpleasant  incidents  have   inevitably\r\n\r\noccurred. Perhaps the P.A.P. think that building  and\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programmes are not compatible  with\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of  the rural  people  and  that  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the rural people must be sacrificed  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of industrialisation. That is why they always\r\n\r\nuse   terms  like  \"industrialisation\"  and  \"housing\r\n\r\nprogrammes\" to suppress the rural people.  Those  who\r\n\r\noppose  their actions are dubbed as anti-national  by\r\n\r\nthem. What else can the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. contribute towards the welfare and  interests\r\n\r\nof  the rural people? It is more pitiful to see their\r\n\r\npersecution of the rural people by making use of  the\r\n\r\nmoney  from  the  rural people for their  other  evil\r\n\r\ndeeds.  We  are of the opinion that the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe broad masses of the rural people and those of the\r\n\r\nworkers   are   compatible  with  each   other.   The\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and housing programmes  should  not\r\n\r\ncontradict  each  other. In our  opinion,  these  two\r\n\r\nprogrammes  are not compatible with the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  rural  people.  We have about  $400  million  in\r\n\r\nrevenue  every  year, and yet we have  to  contribute\r\n\r\n$120  million to the Central Parliament. In  addition\r\n\r\nto  this, we have to lend $150 million to the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.  The P.A.P. further want to  use  public\r\n\r\nfunds to set up centres to train their own cadres.  I\r\n\r\nsay  that if these sums of money are used to resettle\r\n\r\nthose who have been forced to remove in a proper way,\r\n\r\nthen  this  question  can be resolved  to  a  certain\r\n\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during these few days, although\r\n\r\nwe have debated the question of rural policy, all our \r\n\r\nviews  and  opinions have never received  any  proper \r\n\r\nanswer  or reply from the Government Ministers.  That \r\n\r\nis  why I feel that it is again necessary to give  my \r\n\r\nviewpoints on rural policy. Because our viewpoints on\r\n\r\nrural  problems  have  not  been  published  in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, that is why I feel it necessary to  touch\r\n\r\non it again in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, once more I tell the P.A.P. that their\r\n\r\nsuppression of the rural people far exceeds the  help \r\n\r\ngiven to the rural people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

But  do  not\r\n\r\nrepeat  not only what he has said but what  has  been\r\n\r\nsaid over the last four days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nif you think I have been too repetitious, then I will\r\n\r\ntry  to  finish  my  speech in the shortest  possible\r\n\r\ntime.  What I have mentioned just now might not  have\r\n\r\ncovered  all that has been mentioned by my colleagues\r\n\r\nin  the past. But anyway, I will now try to finish my\r\n\r\nspeech by dealing briefly with certain other points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have not been able to find out the real\r\n\r\nproblems existing in the rural areas. Once, when  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister toured a certain rural area, he found\r\n\r\nthat  some  people who came out to welcome  him  with\r\n\r\nbouquets  wore very nice clothes. He then  said  that\r\n\r\nthe rural people were well-fed, wealthy and enjoyed a\r\n\r\nvery  high  standard of living. In  addition  to  the\r\n\r\nforced removal from their land, the rural people  are\r\n\r\nfaced  with  the  scarcity  of  land.  Here  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, the Prime Minister has said previously that\r\n\r\n17,000  acres  of land were occupied by  the  British\r\n\r\nForces.  Had this land been used to help the  people,\r\n\r\nsomething good and useful would have come out of  it,\r\n\r\nand  this, to a certain extent, would have solved the\r\n\r\nscarcity of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many small farmers have gone bankrupt. This was\r\n\r\nbecause they lack capital and know-how. In the  past,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. promised to give loans to them, but  they\r\n\r\nhave  not  fulfilled  their  pledge.  They  have  not\r\n\r\nadopted effective measures to stabilize the prices of\r\n\r\nfarm  products. There is a great fluctuation  in  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  farm produce. For instance, although  the\r\n\r\nprice of pork has gone up, the price\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  poultry has remained at $1 per katty. And because\r\n\r\nof an outbreak of a poultry disease, 200,000 chickens\r\n\r\nperished in this epidemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have stated that after the merger of\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Federation of Malaya, there  would\r\n\r\nnot  be any tariffs. But we see that the tariffs  are\r\n\r\nstill  there. A duty of one cent has to  be  paid  on\r\n\r\neach egg that is exported to the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the Lim Yew Hock regime, two rural organisations were banned. They were the Farmers' Association and the Rural People's Association. And during the regime of the P.A.P., two rural associations were also banned. They were banned after the 16th of September. They have a membership\r\n\r\nof  more than 20,000. And no good reasons were  given\r\n\r\nfor  their  banning. The only reason given  was  that\r\n\r\nthese associations carried out activities which  were\r\n\r\nnot consistent with their rules and regulations. This\r\n\r\ngoes  to show that organisations which do not support\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are suppressed by them. The  banning  of\r\n\r\nthese  two organisations gives an indication  of  the\r\n\r\nrural  policy  of the P.A.P. and their  collaboration\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation Government. It also  symbolises\r\n\r\nthe  unity of the 500,000 rural people. That  is  why\r\n\r\nthey  have to be banned on the pretext that they were\r\n\r\nbeing used by pro-Communist front organisations. This\r\n\r\nis  nonsensical  argument. These rural  organisations\r\n\r\ntruly  represent the rural people. They work for  the\r\n\r\ninterests and welfare of the rural people. They  were\r\n\r\nopposed to the unreasonable policy of the P.A.P. What\r\n\r\nis  wrong with that? Just because they are considered\r\n\r\nto  be organisations that oppose the Government, they\r\n\r\nare  banned. Instead the P.A.P. should arrest Lim Yew\r\n\r\nHock  because  Lim Yew Hock organised  the  so-called\r\n\r\nAlliance  Party, which also has a united front  among\r\n\r\nthem.  The  P.A.P. themselves rely  on  colonialism.\r\n\r\nLikewise  they have a united front - an alliance  with\r\n\r\nthe colonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say that the rural people organise\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  look after their own  interests,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should not accuse them of being  tools  of\r\n\r\nthe Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all actions of the Government, I cannot help\r\n\r\ncoming  to the conclusion that spit and spittle  will\r\n\r\nfall on their heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

I do not think  the\r\n\r\npeople  are  so naive as to believe that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nAssemblymen and Representatives in the Dewan  Ra'ayat\r\n\r\nin  Kuala Lumpur were sincere when they took the oath\r\n\r\nof  loyalty  that  they  will  defend  Malaysia.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan    Sosialis   is   now   in   an   impossible\r\n\r\ncontradiction  out  of  which they  cannot  extricate\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Can  there be anything more  stupid  for\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Assemblymen to take a  solemn  oath\r\n\r\nthat they would defend and die for Malaysia, when  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time  their  own Party  Chairman  publicly\r\n\r\nstated  that he is opposed to Malaysia? The stand  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis is always confusing, like a dog\r\n\r\nchasing its own tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barisan Assemblymen have been only too eager to\r\n\r\nexaggerate  the  unemployment situation  due  to  the\r\n\r\ncessation of trade between us and Indonesia, but they\r\n\r\nhave  not  uttered  a  single  word  to  condemn  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government which brought this  misfortune\r\n\r\nupon the people. In fact, the Member for Tampines has\r\n\r\nsaid  it  is  not the Barisan's concern  whether  the\r\n\r\npresent attitude of Indonesia is correct or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson takes the cake when he urged\r\n\r\nthe Central Government to stop scolding Indonesia. If\r\n\r\nthe  dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia  amounted\r\n\r\nto  only an exchange of words, then there need not be\r\n\r\nany  anxiety at all. Let me ask this. Is  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  not aware that Indonesia  is  not  only\r\n\r\nscolding Malaysia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut also bleeding the people of Malaysia to death  by\r\n\r\nacts  of  aggression along our borders and piracy  in\r\n\r\nour  waters?  This afternoon the Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nrelated   in  this  Assembly  acts  of  sabotage   by\r\n\r\nIndonesian  fifth columnists in Singapore.  Will  the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson, or for that matter any Member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis, be brave enough to go  to  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Parliament and tell big brother to lay off\r\n\r\nsmashing up Malaysia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu declared that the Barisan\r\n\r\noppose Malaysia because of their patriotism and  love\r\n\r\nfor  their  country. Let me ask him.  Which  is  your\r\n\r\ncountry?  He  is not here to answer. May  I  ask  his\r\n\r\ncolleagues, which is their country? Indonesia? Is  it\r\n\r\nthat  the  Barisan loves Indonesia so much  that  Mr\r\n\r\nBani,  ex-Member  for  Thomson,  made  the  revealing\r\n\r\nstatement in this very Chamber that Indonesia is  the\r\n\r\nheartland  of Malaysia? Is it that the Barisan  loves\r\n\r\nAzahari  so  much that it supported  him  during  the\r\n\r\nBrunei  revolt  so  that he could capture  Sabah  and\r\n\r\nSarawak?  Is  it because of patriotism to  Indonesia\r\n\r\nthat  the Barisan is now speaking in this Chamber  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  Indonesia to smash Malaysia? The  Barisan\r\n\r\nhas  called  the  Central  Government  Fascist,  neo-colonialist, brutal, suppressive and by  every  other\r\n\r\nconceivable  adjective  in  the  dictionary.  But  on\r\n\r\nIndonesia  which  is perpetrating aggression  against\r\n\r\nus, they keep a pious and hypocritical silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the Member for Hong Lim, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  want  us  to  crawl to  the  feet  of  Bung\r\n\r\nSoekarno and to plead for mercy. The Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\ndo  not  condemn the Indonesian Government as inhuman\r\n\r\nfor  stopping  water supplies from Singapore  to  the\r\n\r\ninhabitants in the Rhio islands. They do not  condemn\r\n\r\nthe   Indonesian  Government  as  being  Fascist  for\r\n\r\nissuing  a  decree  that all those in  Indonesia  who\r\n\r\nlisten  to Radio Malaysia will be executed.  They  do\r\n\r\nnot  condemn the Indonesian Government as brutal  for\r\n\r\ninspiring   the  terrorism  committed  by  Indonesian\r\n\r\ncommandos in Sarawak and Sabah. On the contrary,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  is  acting  as  an advocate  for  Indonesian\r\n\r\naggression and applauds, what they have called,  \"the\r\n\r\nnational liberation struggle\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Borneo.  Will the Barisan despatch volunteers  to\r\n\r\nhelp Indonesia liberate Sabah and Sarawak as they did\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of West Irian? Is the Barisan  looking\r\n\r\nforward to Soekarno liberating them from the Tunku? I\r\n\r\ndo not think we should make an error in thinking that\r\n\r\nthose  in  the Barisan Sosialis are stupid  men.  Far\r\n\r\nfrom  it.  It will be more correct for us to  believe\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  evil men with sinister  aims.  Their\r\n\r\nhatred  for Malaysia and their delight at being  able\r\n\r\nto  make political capital out of the plight of those\r\n\r\nwho  are  now  unemployed on  account  of  Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation stem from one fact, and one fact alone,\r\n\r\nand that is, the Barisan prefers to sleep in the same\r\n\r\nbed  with  Indonesia  and dream  the  dreams  of  the\r\n\r\nP.K.I., the Communist Party of Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no positive or constructive thinking in\r\n\r\nthe Barisan. Their attitude is one of destruction and\r\n\r\ncondemnation. That was their stand during the general\r\n\r\nelection.  Condemnation  - no  positive  construction.\r\n\r\nThat frame of mind has persisted today. If there is a\r\n\r\ndrought, they condemn the Government for not bringing\r\n\r\nin  the rain. If there is rainfall, they condemn  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for flooding. The Barisan call themselves\r\n\r\nchampions  of  the  workers.  But  they  condemn  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  putting up housing for  the  working\r\n\r\nclass. The Barisan was prepared to sacrifice autonomy\r\n\r\nin  education and labour by demanding complete merger\r\n\r\nwith  Malaya  like Penang and Malacca.  But  what  is\r\n\r\ntheir stand during this debate? Now they plead  with\r\n\r\nthe  Government to protect the autonomy which we have\r\n\r\nfought for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan calls Malaysian citizenship second-class. I suggest let them then apply to become\r\n\r\nIndonesian  citizens, and having acquired  Indonesian\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  they may find a dialectical  answer  to\r\n\r\nexplain the anti-Chinese rioting in Java and Sumatra.\r\n\r\nI do not believe the Barisan appreciate the amenities\r\n\r\nof  civilisation and tranquillity that they now enjoy\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and  Malaysia.  Nothing  can  be  more\r\n\r\nsalutary  than for all of them to go back to Jakarta.\r\n\r\nThey  will  then  be thankful for the little  mercies\r\n\r\nthat they now enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Mr Speaker, we owe a duty to ourselves to\r\n\r\nappreciate  Indonesia's  feelings  on  the  role   of\r\n\r\nSingapore in Indonesian trade so that there  will  be\r\n\r\nless  bewilderment  about the motive  for  Indonesian\r\n\r\neconomic confrontation. For decades Indonesian rubber\r\n\r\nand copra and other raw produce have been sold to the\r\n\r\nmarkets of the world through Singapore and in  return\r\n\r\nrice,  textiles and consumer goods have been imported\r\n\r\ninto  Indonesia,  again through Singapore.  This  has\r\n\r\nbeen   possible  partly  because  of  our  commercial\r\n\r\nexpertise  and  the banking and insurance  facilities\r\n\r\nwhich exist in Singapore and partly because Indonesia\r\n\r\nhas  no port comparable in efficiency and ability  to\r\n\r\nhandle the world's shipping to our own port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since Indonesia attained her independence in\r\n\r\n1949,   she  had  always  been  conscious   of   this\r\n\r\ndependence on our entrepot port to conduct her  trade\r\n\r\nwith   the   rest   of   the   world.   Because    of\r\n\r\nmaladministration,   over-attention   to    political\r\n\r\naffairs   and   inattention  to   economic   matters,\r\n\r\nIndonesia   had  no  alternative  but   to   tolerate\r\n\r\nSingapore's  role  as  her banker  and  trade  agent.\r\n\r\nIndonesian  oil  had been distributed throughout  her\r\n\r\narchipelago  by ships based in Singapore,  a  foreign\r\n\r\nport.   This   has  always  been  regarded   by   the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  as prejudicial to their own defence  and\r\n\r\nsecurity   measures.   The  desire,   therefore,   by\r\n\r\nIndonesia  not  to  rely  on  Singapore  traders  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  based ships is therefore not an  overnight\r\n\r\ndecision but one which has been considered for a long\r\n\r\ntime.  As  has  been indicated by the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nthis  afternoon in his statement, Indonesian  efforts\r\n\r\nto  subvert Singapore began in 1960, long before  the\r\n\r\nTunku announced his support for the Malaysia Plan. In\r\n\r\nother  words, let us not underestimate the  political\r\n\r\nintention  and ambitions of Indonesian  leaders,  The\r\n\r\numbilical cord between Singapore and Indonesia had to\r\n\r\nbe  cut  some  day;  confrontation  against  Malaysia\r\n\r\nprecipitated the economic surgery. Quite obviously in\r\n\r\nthis   context,  we  ourselves  must  make  our   own\r\n\r\nreadjustments.  Fortunately the  Government  has,  as\r\n\r\nearly as 4 years ago, foreseen the difficulties which\r\n\r\nSingapore would face with each passing year if we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade no efforts to diversify our economy. Singapore's\r\n\r\ntrading   economy  could  not  grow  if  neighbouring\r\n\r\nindependent  countries were to take  steps  to  trade\r\n\r\ndirectly  with  other parts of the  world.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nsince  our trading economy could not grow as fast  as\r\n\r\nour increasing population, new avenues for productive\r\n\r\nactivity  had  to  be  found. So positive  plans  for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in Singapore were laid down by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  Economic  Development   Board   was\r\n\r\nfounded  and  plans to create industrial  estates  in\r\n\r\ndifferent parts of Singapore were executed. It is our\r\n\r\nhope  that  in  the next five years industrialisation\r\n\r\nwill  be  on  its way to fulfilment.  But  to  enable\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in Singapore to start and in  order\r\n\r\nfor us to maintain the tempo of industrialisation, it\r\n\r\nis  essential that industrial peace be observed,  for\r\n\r\nwithout  industrial peace, factories will be  working\r\n\r\nat  half cock, or some of them may even close down as\r\n\r\nwe  have observed in the past few years. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance two days ago in answer to a question has\r\n\r\nso  ably  illustrated  what irresponsibility  in  the\r\n\r\ntrade    union    field   could    do    to    damage\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. It is also essential that  markets\r\n\r\nmust  be  found for goods manufactured in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nFortunately, no one can be complacent by solely being\r\n\r\ndependent upon our home market. There is already  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Common Market which has been agreed  to  by\r\n\r\nthe  four  territories of Malaysia.  However,  it  is\r\n\r\nessential  that, if our manufacturers are to  prosper\r\n\r\nand  the  people  to  share in the  prosperity,  that\r\n\r\nCommon  Market  must  be  extended.  Exports  towards\r\n\r\noverseas  markets must eventually play a considerable\r\n\r\npart  in  preserving our prosperity and  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.  Our  economic tasks ahead are difficult  but\r\n\r\nnot  impossible.  So  long as our  entrepreneurs  and\r\n\r\nworkers  can  be inspired in the task of building  up\r\n\r\nour  economy and our Malaysian nation, the  prospects\r\n\r\nare bright, notwithstanding Indonesian confrontation,\r\n\r\nand  we  all look forward to a new historical era  in\r\n\r\nwhich true Malaysians can play a loyal part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Their purpose is to read\r\n\r\nout under cover of privilege in this Chamber long and\r\n\r\ndreary extracts repeating the Communist united  front\r\n\r\nline,  anti-Malaysia, and anti any policy or plan  of\r\n\r\naction that in any way makes things difficult for the\r\n\r\nCommunists to strengthen their ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this motion of thanks, I had set out in\r\n\r\nbroad  outline  four main targets, industrialisation,\r\n\r\nhousing   and  the  re-building  of  the  old   city,\r\n\r\neducation to meet the needs of an industrial society,\r\n\r\nand,   last,   raising  of  social  standards,   Most\r\n\r\nimportant  of all, I had explained a new addition  to\r\n\r\nthe  organisational structure of the Government,  the\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Consultative  Committees.  One would  have\r\n\r\nexpected  the  Opposition, if it  were  a  democratic\r\n\r\nOpposition,  anxious to play its role as constructive\r\n\r\ncritic,  to  take  the  Government  up  on  its  main\r\n\r\ntargets,  to show, if they can, why these targets  do\r\n\r\nnot  measure  up to the economic and social  problems\r\n\r\nbefore the country and how they can be improved.  But\r\n\r\nno such debate has taken place. It is clear that what\r\n\r\nwe  are going to have, even more so than in the  last\r\n\r\nAssembly,  are  long and windy, repetitious  speeches\r\n\r\nall  scripted beforehand and dutifully  read  out  in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber. They talk of the death of freedom,  of\r\n\r\nthe  end of democratic rights, of merger and Malaysia\r\n\r\nbeing a sell-out, all as if the referendum never took\r\n\r\nplace  last  year  and as if they had  won  the  last\r\n\r\ngeneral elections. For\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  appears  that,  every evidence  to  the  contrary\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding, only they can speak for the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said in introducing the motion that we\r\n\r\nmust  always  be prepared to face new situations  and\r\n\r\nadapt  and adjust the democratic system to  meet  the\r\n\r\nspecific problems as they come up from time to  time.\r\n\r\nThree-quarters of the time on the debate on the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan   Negara's  speech  and  on   the   Budget\r\n\r\nEstimates  were more properly within the province  of\r\n\r\nour Parliament in Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for various reasons they feel inhibited and\r\n\r\nthey  have  remained silent in Kuala Lumpur  although\r\n\r\ntheir  parliamentary  leader, the  Member  for  Bukit\r\n\r\nMerah,  has  taken leave from this  House  to  attend\r\n\r\nParliament since the 11th of December. And it is  his\r\n\r\ncomrades  here  who  have  dressed  in  parliamentary\r\n\r\nprivilege  the ghost writings in Chinese of  a  hard-working  but somewhat unimaginative group of aspiring\r\n\r\nMarxist-Leninists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By our next sitting I think we should have re-adjusted our Standing Orders to take into account\r\n\r\nthis growing abuse of the legislative chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no desire to give a point-by-point\r\n\r\nrefutation  of their line of calumny. Suffice  it  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  if  we were able to survive their  vicious\r\n\r\ncampaign  of lies, scare and slander which they  have\r\n\r\nunleashed since June 1961, we can and will debunk all\r\n\r\nthese  dreary falsehoods, for finally it  is  on  the\r\n\r\nrecord of our performance in the five years from  now\r\n\r\nthat the people will judge us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we should do well to always remember that\r\n\r\nif  they, the Barisan Sosialis, were in charge of the\r\n\r\ncountry,  it  is  very  unlikely  that  we  would  be\r\n\r\nallowed, in the Opposition, to say the things of them\r\n\r\nthat  we  have allowed them to say of us. It is  also\r\n\r\nunlikely in that situation that either in the  unions\r\n\r\nor  in  the  civic organisations we would be  allowed\r\n\r\neven a one-hundredth part of the opportunity that  we\r\n\r\nare  now  giving  them to organise and  preach  their\r\n\r\ngospel  against the nation. Our failing, I fear,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is not that we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstifled democratic rights and liberties, but that  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  too  tolerant with a  group  of  men  who\r\n\r\ninterpret tolerance as a weakness to be exploited and\r\n\r\nabused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can all remember what happened throughout Malaya\r\n\r\nand  Singapore in the few weeks immediately after the\r\n\r\ndefeat  of Japan and before the re-occupation by  the\r\n\r\nBritish Forces. The Communists were in charge in some\r\n\r\ntowns  and districts. Sir, Members on the other  side\r\n\r\nhave  been talking about the right to free  and  open\r\n\r\ntrial.  But  the  unreasoning, unceasing  screech  of\r\n\r\nhatred  which  they have preached leads  us  straight\r\n\r\nback  to  the  summary methods of  justice  that  the\r\n\r\npeople's  courts then enforced. They had little  time\r\n\r\nand even less regard for the niceties of the rules of\r\n\r\nevidence  and of trial by jury. We on this side  must\r\n\r\nnever forget that if ever we lose this fight, then we\r\n\r\nmust  be  stupid to expect of them to concede  to  us\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  conceded  to them  even  after  their\r\n\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is worthwhile pointing out to them that\r\n\r\nwhilst  the democratic system concedes the rights  of\r\n\r\nopposition  to  the new nation before it  is  formed,\r\n\r\nonce  it  has  been formed, to preach disloyalty  and\r\n\r\nincite  disaffection against Malaysia is treason  and\r\n\r\npunishable  as such. Sir, they may have  taken  their\r\n\r\noath  both  here  and  in Parliament  to  defend  the\r\n\r\nConstitution of Malaysia more out of perfunctory duty\r\n\r\nthan  out  of any conviction. But let them know  that\r\n\r\nthe  whole of the apparatus of the State will go into\r\n\r\nmotion  if  they, instead of honouring  this  pledge,\r\n\r\nactively  incite  disaffection, The  whole  of  their\r\n\r\neffort over the past ten days has been to cast doubts\r\n\r\non  Malaysia, weaken the people's resolve  to  defend\r\n\r\nit, and generally create disloyalty to the Government\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia.  Sir, one can more than  guess  at  the\r\n\r\nmotives  of  these  speeches,  when  we  find   Radio\r\n\r\nKalimantan   Utara  picking  up  with  relish   every\r\n\r\nfalsehood  on  Malaysia, every  exaggeration  on  the\r\n\r\neffects  of Indonesian confrontation, that  has  been\r\n\r\nuttered  in  this  House. Whatever  they  said  their\r\n\r\nintentions  were, the consistent use to  which  enemy\r\n\r\npropaganda has put\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches can leave no doubt that they are,  in\r\n\r\nfact, helping the confrontationists to inflict injury\r\n\r\non Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the very wording of this motion,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`regrets that the Government in helping to impose\r\n\r\n`Malaysia on the people has caused great difficulties\r\n\r\nand  hardships  to them in Singapore  and  urges  the\r\n\r\nGovernment ...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and so on, every phrase is cast in terms of villainy.\r\n\r\nTo  talk  of  Malaysia having been imposed  upon  the\r\n\r\npeople  - I presume the people of Singapore - after  it\r\n\r\nhas been endorsed both at the referendum and again at\r\n\r\nthe  general  elections is not just to  perpetrate  a\r\n\r\nlie, but to actively help hostile forces around us to\r\n\r\nintervene against Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the disclosure today that confrontation even\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore does not stop at a trade  boycott  but\r\n\r\ngoes  on to active sabotage which has cost up to date\r\n\r\nthe   lives   of  two  innocent  civilians,   a   new\r\n\r\nsignificance is given to the anti-Malaysia activities\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition.  Sir, the  intelligence  network\r\n\r\nshows  that  these  activities  of  penetration   and\r\n\r\nsubversion have been going on for many months  before\r\n\r\nMalaysia  was even mooted. Reluctantly one is  pushed\r\n\r\nto   the  conclusion  that,  quite  unconnected  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  a  scheme was launched at penetration  and\r\n\r\nsubversion  which, if successful, must  lead  to  the\r\n\r\ngradual  absorption of Singapore and Malaya, and  now\r\n\r\nMalaysia, by our bigger neighbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violence that has been undertaken was planned\r\n\r\nonly  after April this year, shortly before Malaysia,\r\n\r\nhut the cultural and ideological penetration had been\r\n\r\nmounted  several years ago even before  Malaysia  was\r\n\r\never  suggested. We must be blind if we fail  to  see\r\n\r\nthe  basic objective and the end result of all  these\r\n\r\nActivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have asked the Opposition is: on\r\n\r\nwhose side are they on? They have not answered.  They\r\n\r\nhave  remained silent. They have never even  admitted\r\n\r\nthe existence of Malaysia. So how can they even admit\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  Malaysian? And how can  they  defend\r\n\r\nMalaysia, if they are not Malaysian?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  let  me give them this piece of advice: whatever\r\n\r\ntheir  intentions, if by any overt act, by  any  open\r\n\r\naction,  they  help the enemy against Malaysia,  then\r\n\r\nthey must bear the full consequences of being treated\r\n\r\nas traitors to the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Indonesia is now prepared to use\r\n\r\nagents  and  fifth columnists to disrupt our  economy\r\n\r\nputs a sombre hue on our responsibilities. We are now\r\n\r\nin  the  midst of, literally, a battle  of  life  and\r\n\r\ndeath,  a  battle  for survival, our  survival  as  a\r\n\r\nseparate entity, to live our lives in our own way  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia  unmolested  by  bigger   and   more\r\n\r\npowerful  neighbours. We have always feared that  the\r\n\r\ntemptation of the big to be bigger and to absorb  the\r\n\r\nsmaller would be too much to resist. But now we  know\r\n\r\nfor   a   fact  that  confrontation  includes   fifth\r\n\r\ncolumnists and saboteurs trained to wreck the economy\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and, even more important, to weaken the\r\n\r\nwill  of  the  people of Singapore and of  the  other\r\n\r\nparts  of Malaysia to resist absorption, for that  is\r\n\r\nthe alternative to Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our chances of survival are ten times better in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  than if we were by ourselves. Malaysia  may\r\n\r\nhave  been followed by a trade boycott and a loss  of\r\n\r\n8.7 per cent of our national income. But this was not\r\n\r\nthe  logical  consequence of  Malaysia.  It  was  the\r\n\r\nconsequence  of a conscious act of the Government  of\r\n\r\nthe  Republic of Indonesia to inflict damage  on  all\r\n\r\nthe  parties in Malaysia, either by economic sanction\r\n\r\neven if it costs Indonesia four times our losses,  or\r\n\r\nby  military pressure along our borders and  sabotage\r\n\r\nfrom  within,  if  it appears to  have  a  chance  of\r\n\r\nsuccess,   then   direct   military   action   cannot\r\n\r\naltogether be ruled out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must resolve to defend ourselves to the death,\r\n\r\nfor  death  is preferable to conquest and absorption.\r\n\r\nWhen  our  neighbours, both friendly and  unfriendly,\r\n\r\nunderstand  this, then peace in South-East  Asia  is\r\n\r\nmore  likely  to be preserved. Whatever the  economic\r\n\r\npressures,  whatever  the  harassment  by   sabotage,\r\n\r\nwhatever  the  psychological  tensions,  let  no  one\r\n\r\nmistake our right to be masters in our own house.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  afford  to  be  befuddled  or  bemused   into\r\n\r\nweakening in our resolve for Malaysia. What is at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstake is not just 8.7 per cent of our national income\r\n\r\nbut, literally, our survival as a separate people  in\r\n\r\nthis  part  of the world. When survival is at  stake,\r\n\r\nthose  who  help the enemy to weaken the nation  will\r\n\r\nfind  to  their cost that the nation is  prepared  to\r\n\r\ndefend  itself  against the enemy  without  and  also\r\n\r\nagainst the enemy within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this House to reject this amendment as the\r\n\r\nline of treachery and treason. If ever the Communists\r\n\r\nsucceed  in weakening our resolve for Malaysia,  then\r\n\r\nverily,  first, Sarawak, then Sabah, then  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  finally Malaysia itself, will be slowly absorbed\r\n\r\ninto the Indonesian orbit. If this happens, then even\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan which has moved this amendment may  look\r\n\r\nback to this era as a golden age compared to what  is\r\n\r\nin  store for them and indeed for all others in  that\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, since over a\r\n\r\nweek   ago  this  House  has  witnessed  the  tactics\r\n\r\nexhibited  by the Barisan Sosialis Members when  this\r\n\r\nHouse  debated matters which have been  tabled.  From\r\n\r\ntheir  tactics, it is obvious that the seven  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members behave like agents of their  masters\r\n\r\nwho  instruct  them what to do, without  taking  into\r\n\r\nconsideration the consequences of their actions. This\r\n\r\nis  not  surprising, Mr Deputy Speaker, because  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Members are still  young  and  they\r\n\r\nthink  that  this  House is a place  where  they  can\r\n\r\nindulge  in  games  so that they  can  exhibit  their\r\n\r\nbravery.  All  this, as I have said earlier,  is  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of raw parish pump politicians who  do  not\r\n\r\nfollow the trend of debates previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their speeches remind me of the writings of Mao Tse-tung, their big leader, in one of his articles\r\n\r\nentitled  Tactics to Oppose Imperialist Japan.  Inter\r\n\r\nalia, Mao Tse-tung said that the young people have  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  ideas  -  good plans - but  they  cannot  be\r\n\r\ntrusted  to implement state and world tasks,  because\r\n\r\nthey  are unable to understand such tasks. I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  the  Barisan Members, who are raw,  understand\r\n\r\nwhat they have said themselves. I do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  think they understand the consequences  and  the\r\n\r\ndangers  of their speeches which they merely read  in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber.  After  hearing  their  speeches,   my\r\n\r\nconclusion  is that generally their speeches  do  not\r\n\r\nindicate  any sign of loyalty at all to this country.\r\n\r\nOn  the  contrary, their speeches are of a nature  to\r\n\r\ninstigate  the  people to fight Malaysia,  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen acknowledged by the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are their speeches really concerned with how to\r\n\r\nimprove  this  country? Are their speeches  concerned\r\n\r\nwith  how  to  solve the unemployment  problem  as  a\r\n\r\nresult   of   economic  confrontation   launched   by\r\n\r\nIndonesia?  Do  their  speeches contain  constructive\r\n\r\nsuggestions  on how we should provide more  amenities\r\n\r\nand  assistance for the benefit of the people of this\r\n\r\ncountry? Or what should be done by the Government  to\r\n\r\ngive   facilities  to  the  rural  dwellers  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry?  Or  what should be done by  all  of  us  to\r\n\r\ndefend  ourselves  from  aggression  and  threat   by\r\n\r\nIndonesia?  Not a thing. The speeches by the  Barisan\r\n\r\nMembers,  on  the  whole, indicate  how  Malaysia  is\r\n\r\nsuffering as a result of confrontation which  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing launched by Indonesia. Their speeches show that\r\n\r\nthe people are against merger, and the people of this\r\n\r\ncountry  will  rise at any time in arms because  they\r\n\r\noppose  Malaysia. Which people? Are they  the  people\r\n\r\nwho  have chosen Malaysia in the referendum? Are they\r\n\r\nthe  people who have cast their votes in the  general\r\n\r\nelections  in  September last and who have  reelected\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government to govern for a further  five\r\n\r\nyears? No, definitely no, Mr Deputy Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people referred to in their speeches are those\r\n\r\nanti-nationals   and   pro-Communists,   whom    they\r\n\r\nrepresent  in  this  Chamber,  and  the  people   who\r\n\r\ncomprise the minority and who do not wish to see this\r\n\r\ncountry  prosper  and live in peace and  harmony.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the speeches of the Barisan Sosialis  are  not\r\n\r\ndirected  at the people of Malaysia, but directed  at\r\n\r\nthe   Communists  in  Indonesia  and  abroad.  I   am\r\n\r\nconfident  that what they have said in  this  Chamber\r\n\r\nwill   be   broadcast  by  Radio   Indonesia,   Radio\r\n\r\nKalimantan  Utara, and Radio Peking. Do the  speeches\r\n\r\nby the hon. Members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncondemn  Indonesia for launching aggression in  North\r\n\r\nBorneo?  Do  their speeches contain the incidents  of\r\n\r\nintrusion of Indonesian war-planes over the Malaysian\r\n\r\nsky and Indonesian pirates who robbed the property of\r\n\r\nour  fishermen  in  the Straits  of  Malacca  and  in\r\n\r\ninternational  waters? Not a bit.  On  the  contrary,\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches  indicate they  are  encouraging  the\r\n\r\nincidents to continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel such an attitude as exhibited by these hon.\r\n\r\nMembers, sooner or later, will encourage Indonesia to\r\n\r\ncommit  aggression against Malaya and Singapore.  One\r\n\r\nday  we  will  witness Indonesian jet bombers  flying\r\n\r\nover  this  Chamber. Confrontation has increased  our\r\n\r\nresponsibility even more, because more problems  have\r\n\r\nbeen   created.  Plans  which  were  to   have   been\r\n\r\nimplemented  by the Government for the betterment  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  cannot be put into effect  now,  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  obliged  to  concentrate  on   their\r\n\r\nefforts to solve problems of unemployment as a result\r\n\r\nof  Indonesian  confrontation, with the encouragement\r\n\r\nof  hon. Members opposite us. But, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nthere  is good in confrontation because it has caused\r\n\r\nthe  people in this country comprising many races  to\r\n\r\nbe even more united behind the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last general elections, the people voted the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government once again to govern the  country.\r\n\r\nWe  are proud that the people have put their faith in\r\n\r\nus.  I am happy to say in this Chamber that the trust\r\n\r\nplaced in us will be honoured and, God willing,  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  betrayed forever. The faith and trust placed\r\n\r\nin  us  by the people will be reciprocated. I promise\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. Government will never at  any  time\r\n\r\nmisplace  this trust. We will continue to strive  for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  and improvement of the people  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  as a whole. What we hope from the people  is\r\n\r\ntheir  co-operation and understanding so that we  can\r\n\r\nsmash  the  anti-national and pro-Communist  elements\r\n\r\nwhich  are  in  our midst. We are proud.  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  in  this struggle to eliminate these  anti-national elements, the people are solidly behind  us.\r\n\r\nThe Malaysia Plan was announced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby the Malaysian Prime Minister, the Hon. Tunku Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman, about two years ago. About six months  later,\r\n\r\nthat  was  on the 17th November, 1962, the  New  York\r\n\r\nTimes published a letter signed by Dr Subandrio, the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Foreign Minister, who mentioned  the  plan\r\n\r\nto  establish Malaysia. In addition to welcoming such\r\n\r\na  plan Dr Subandrio, who voiced the official  stand\r\n\r\nof  the Indonesian Government, said, inter alia, that\r\n\r\n\"the  Indonesian Government sends its good wishes  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia  because  the  object  of  Malaysia  is  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  decolonisation of  Malaya  over  Borneo,\r\n\r\nSarawak and Singapore and that Malaysia will free the\r\n\r\npeople  of these three territories from the  shackles\r\n\r\nand  exploitation of colonialism.\" Not a word did the\r\n\r\nletter  mention that Malaysia was a new form of  neo-colonialism  planned  by  the  British  and  American\r\n\r\nimperialists and neo-colonialists. Tunku Abdul Rahman\r\n\r\nwas praised for mooting such a plan. Furthermore, Dr\r\n\r\nSubandrio  urged the people of Sarawak and  Sabah  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  their  own  fate and choose  whether  they\r\n\r\nwished  to join Malaysia or otherwise. The people  of\r\n\r\nSabah  and  Sarawak have made their decision  through\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections in their respective  countries  to\r\n\r\njoin  Malaysia. Singapore through the referendum also\r\n\r\ndecided  for merger and Malaysia. All these means  of\r\n\r\ngetting  the approval of the people have been carried\r\n\r\nout   by  the  Governments  of  Sabah,  Sarawak   and\r\n\r\nSingapore.    In   accordance   with   constitutional\r\n\r\ndemocratic  practice, they voted of  their  own  free\r\n\r\nwill, without coercion, and by the secret ballot they\r\n\r\nchose  Malaysia.  What else do these anti-nationalist\r\n\r\npro-Communists  want?  The  people  have  made  their\r\n\r\ndecision  clear  that they desire Malaysia.  But  the\r\n\r\nanti-nationalist elements and pro-Communists  refused\r\n\r\nto  acknowledge the decision of the people. Then they\r\n\r\nstarted to spread wild charges that the elections and\r\n\r\nreferendum  were  conducted as a sham  and  that  the\r\n\r\npeople were bluffed and frightened so that they  were\r\n\r\nforced to choose Malaysia and merger. But, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker  we all know that the decision of the  people\r\n\r\nhas  caused  the  anti-nationalist and  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nelements, represented by the Barisan Sosialis in this \r\n\r\nChamber, to    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuffer  a  severe thrashing because their leaders  at\r\n\r\nthat  time  made statements indicating that  Malaysia\r\n\r\ncould not be destroyed from within this country. Then\r\n\r\nthey  started  their instigation from  outside.  They\r\n\r\nmade  contacts  with Communists from  outside.  Their\r\n\r\nleaders, such as Lim Ching Siong, have stated  openly\r\n\r\nin  the newspaper Bintang Timor in Indonesia that the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis preferred to merge  with  Indonesia\r\n\r\nand  that  Singapore would be better off  by  merging\r\n\r\nwith   Indonesia  than  with  Malaysia.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  leaders and leaders of the Socialist  Front\r\n\r\nin  Malaya  also  made close contact  with  Communist\r\n\r\nleaders  in  Indonesia. Then  they  used  Azahari,  a\r\n\r\nbankrupt politician, to launch an armed revolution in\r\n\r\nBrunei.  We  all know that before the revolution  was\r\n\r\nlaunched on the 8th of October last year, Azahari had\r\n\r\nseveral   negotiations  with  the  Barisan   Sosialis\r\n\r\nleaders  in  Singapore. A few weeks  before  that,  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Barisan  Sosialis leaders  went  over  to\r\n\r\nBorneo  to  persuade the people there to support  the\r\n\r\narmed   insurrection.  Azahari  launched  his   armed\r\n\r\nrevolution  which was crushed in a matter  of  a  few\r\n\r\ndays.   He   fled  to  Manila  and  subsequently   to\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  Agitation from outside  against  Malaysia\r\n\r\ncontinued.  The P.K.I. launched a big  campaign  with\r\n\r\nthe help of the Barisan Sosialis to oppose Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, how the\r\n\r\nCommunists and their puppets, their lackeys, tried to\r\n\r\nevict Malaya from attending the Afro-Asian Solidarity\r\n\r\nConference  in Moshi. The Communists were afraid  and\r\n\r\nworried  because  of the presence  of  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\ndelegation from Singapore who could expose their  lie\r\n\r\nabout  Malaysia.  The Communists  in  the  conference\r\n\r\ntried  to  lobby  the other Afro-Asian  countries  to\r\n\r\nagree  to  a resolution to send 20,000 volunteers  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  aggression perpetrated  by  Azahari  in\r\n\r\nBorneo,  but  the  Singapore  and  Malayan  delegates\r\n\r\nheaded by Mr Devan Nair - a sincere and true patriot,\r\n\r\nwho  at  one time was involved in the M.C.P. struggle\r\n\r\nbut   who  later  left  the  M.C.P. because  he  was\r\n\r\nconvinced  that the struggle launched by  the  M.C.P.\r\n\r\nwas not good for this country - were able to influence\r\n\r\nthe other delegates in Moshi. Likewise, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Afro-Asian Journalists Conference held in Jakarta\r\n\r\nnot   long  ago,  the  Communist  groups  once  again\r\n\r\nexpressed  strong opposition to Malaysia,  but  their\r\n\r\nefforts were futile, and they could not influence the\r\n\r\nother  delegates  from the Afro-Asian  countries  who\r\n\r\nattended that conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the people who have really fought for Malaysia outside this country, with the result that the United Arab Republic, India, Burma and other countries gave their support to the establishment of Malaysia, are the leaders of the P.A.P. headed by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Do the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Members in this Chamber consider the\r\n\r\nU.A.R., India and Burma as neo-colonialist countries?\r\n\r\nIf  the  Members  opposite consider themselves  anti-colonial, we are even more anti-colonial. But we  are\r\n\r\nnational  patriots  with undivided  loyalty  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  and we are prepared at any time  to  defend\r\n\r\nour  country  against aggression  from  any  quarter.\r\n\r\nWhere is the patriotism of the hon. Members opposite?\r\n\r\nAre they loyal to this country? No. Their loyalty  is\r\n\r\nto  Indonesia. They are agents of Communist Indonesia\r\n\r\nwhich has embarked on confrontation against Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThey  do not work for the interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nthis  country,  but  for  their  foreign  masters  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia. In other words, they are agents  of  their\r\n\r\nforeign  masters  in Jakarta. They are  agents  of  a\r\n\r\ncountry  which is our enemy - a government  which  has\r\n\r\nembarked  on  aggression resulting in many  Malaysian\r\n\r\nlives  being  lost. They represent the enemies  in  a\r\n\r\nplace where they get facilities for education, and as\r\n\r\nMembers  of this Assembly, they receive an  allowance\r\n\r\nof $500 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this country has fed them - sometimes they eat food more than three times a day;\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia, if you get food once in three days you\r\n\r\nare  lucky.  But  what  has happened?  They  are  the\r\n\r\nspokesmen of a country which is determined  to  smash\r\n\r\nus.  I  am  ashamed  to see their behaviour  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber.  I  do not think any true Malaysian  citizen\r\n\r\nwill  adopt such low tactics of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite. They expect that if  confrontation\r\n\r\nsucceeds, they will get high places in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry;  they hope that their defeated candidate  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  election in Rochore will be elected  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and that many of them will be Ministers. Let\r\n\r\nme  emphasise  here  that  if  we  are  destroyed  by\r\n\r\nIndonesia, they will not get a chance at all to  hold\r\n\r\nsuch  posts which they dream of. What will happen  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  aggressors from Indonesia will  confiscate\r\n\r\neverything  in this country and what the agents  will\r\n\r\nget  will be the residues from the hungry aggressors.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is no use for them to shout in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  that  the P.A.P. Government are  exploiting\r\n\r\nand   suppressing  Chinese  education  and   culture,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  know  very well the  attitude  of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian leaders towards the Chinese. Yesterday, my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Minister for Culture, stated  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  that  the utterances and behaviour  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis over the last few days will involve\r\n\r\nthem  in  a  very dangerous position. What they  have\r\n\r\ndone  amounts  to treason against the government  and\r\n\r\nthe   nation,  and  according  to  the  law,  it   is\r\n\r\npunishable  by  death. For that  reason,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  their leaders like Messrs. Woodhull,  James\r\n\r\nPuthucheary and Lim Shee Ping have announced publicly\r\n\r\nthat  they  do not wish to associate themselves  with\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis activities because these actions\r\n\r\nare  fraught with danger. Therefore, the necks of the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members in front of me are in the  noose.\r\n\r\nPeople  like Messrs. Woodhull, James Puthucheary  and\r\n\r\nLim  Shee  Ping are no political chickens. They  know\r\n\r\nthe  consequence  if they involve themselves  in  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of  the Barisan Sosialis. They  are  more\r\n\r\npolitically  intelligent  than  these  seven  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members. Well, there is still time. I advise\r\n\r\nthem to retreat before they are swallowed. I wish  to\r\n\r\nremind  the Members opposite that the people in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  condemn  their acts which involve  treachery\r\n\r\nand  treason in collaboration with foreign  countries\r\n\r\nto  smash Malaysia. They are fed up and they hate the\r\n\r\ntactics  of  the  Barisan. The Barisan  Members  must\r\n\r\nconsider carefully what they say and how they  behave\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly.  They may  be  applauded  by  the\r\n\r\nGallery  but they are hated by members of the public.\r\n\r\nTheir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacts  are  bringing shame to the people of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nLet  us  take  stock  of the position.  Refrain  from\r\n\r\ncarrying  out treacherous acts against this  country,\r\n\r\nbecause those who will bear the consequences will  be\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Members themselves opposite. As we reminded\r\n\r\nthem  yesterday,  there is still  time  for  them  to\r\n\r\nreconsider the situation. If they are lost at the end\r\n\r\nof  the road, they should go back to the beginning of\r\n\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, today we have read in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers that 37 saboteurs from Indonesia have been \r\n\r\narrested. I feel that in the next few days the  total \r\n\r\nwill  be increased. At least a further seven will  be \r\n\r\nnabbed! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The Member for Paya Lebar is\r\n\r\nmost  eager to speak, but I think the Chair has given\r\n\r\nample  opportunity to the Opposition to speak. As  he\r\n\r\nis  the  last speaker in the Opposition, I intend  to\r\n\r\ngive the Government benchers the opportunity to speak\r\n\r\nfirst  and  he will then be given plenty of  time  to\r\n\r\nspeak later. Mr Yong Nyuk Lin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in  support  of\r\n\r\nthe  motion,  standing  in  the  name  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  expressing  our thanks  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara for his speech on 29th November, 1963,\r\n\r\nand  to  reject the amendment proposed by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Jurong which was supported by the Member for Paya\r\n\r\nLebar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Singapore can reasonably be proud of its\r\n\r\nhealth  and medical services, if judged in comparison\r\n\r\nwith standards obtainable in countries of South Asia,\r\n\r\nyet  we see no reason for complacency over this state\r\n\r\nof  affairs, because we must always strive  to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  standards  of public health and hygiene  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  the highest possible pitch, so that  ill-health  and  disease  can be reduced  to  its  lowest\r\n\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in attempting to provide better medical\r\n\r\nfacilities for our people, we must ultimately face up\r\n\r\nwith  other  problems,  e.g. finance,  shortage   of\r\n\r\nqualified  personnel  like  doctors,  which  is   not\r\n\r\npeculiar to Singapore alone but is world wide in  its\r\n\r\napplicability. Therefore, we,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed  to find new solutions to our problems by making\r\n\r\ngreater  efforts  to  recruit and  train  more  para-medical  and  auxiliary staff like nurses  (male  and\r\n\r\nfemale),  health inspectors, laboratory  technicians,\r\n\r\nmidwives  and others, in order to provide a full  and\r\n\r\nadequate service for our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is well known, our rate of population growth at\r\n\r\nnearly  4  per  cent per annum is twice  the  average\r\n\r\nworld rate. But our present infant mortality rate  at\r\n\r\n31  per thousand live births and crude death rate  at\r\n\r\nunder 6 per thousand are reasonably comparable to any\r\n\r\nof  the advanced nations of the world today. In these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, we must pay more attention  to  family\r\n\r\nplanning  for our mothers than hitherto.  I  wish  in\r\n\r\nthis respect to pay the highest tribute, Sir, to  the\r\n\r\ngallant efforts of our dedicated voluntary workers in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Family Planning Association for  their\r\n\r\ngood  work  in the past and to assure them  that  our\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  spare no efforts henceforth  to  work\r\n\r\nmore  closely  with  them, in order  to  provide  yet\r\n\r\nbetter   facilities   for   the   dissemination    of\r\n\r\ninformation and advice to mothers at every one of our\r\n\r\nMaternal   and   Child   Health  Centres   throughout\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, how healthy a country's\r\n\r\npopulation  is  will  largely be  determined  by  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of its public health measures.  May  I\r\n\r\nremind the House of the relevant part of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech on the  subject  of  Public\r\n\r\nHealth  [Hansard, 29th November, 1963, col.  124]?  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned it before, Sir, in the Budget debate,\r\n\r\nbut I think it needs repetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the Public Health side, the Ministry is\r\n\r\nplanning  a  reorganisation  of  the  City  Cleansing\r\n\r\nservices.  A gradual run-down of transport equipment,\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  urban  and  housing  areas   and   the\r\n\r\ncorresponding huge increase in the number of hawkers,\r\n\r\ninadequate methods of supervision resulting  in  lack\r\n\r\nof  discipline  in  the  work force,  complicated  by\r\n\r\nsecret  society elements in their midst, have brought\r\n\r\nabout  an  increase in rubbish, flies and mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nAll  this  can  and will be put right. Reorganisation\r\n\r\ncan succeed once these factors have been dealt with.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In his speech of 9th December, our Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nwhen elaborating on the fourth target of the\r\n\r\nGovernment for the next five years - that of raising\r\n\r\nsocial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandards - said [Hansard, Vol. 22, No. 4, col 148]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I wish to emphasise higher standards of public and\r\n\r\nsocial conduct. This can be brought about by a\r\n\r\nsustained process of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was inevitable that with new forms of popular\r\n\r\nand representative government, hawkers, squatters and\r\n\r\nother  social problems increase. But slowly as social\r\n\r\nstandards  and  civic  consciousness  correspondingly\r\n\r\nincrease,  hawkers for instance begin  to  understand\r\n\r\nthat  they  must stay out of the main traffic  routes\r\n\r\nand  that  they  must  for their  own  sake  maintain\r\n\r\ncertain standards of cleanliness and hygiene. Litter,\r\n\r\nrubbish, flies and mosquitoes are not only the job of\r\n\r\nthe  Health Ministry and the workers in the Cleansing\r\n\r\nDepartment, but the social responsibility of all.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Public  health measures, Sir, can therefore  only  be\r\n\r\neffective  if each and every one plays his part,  and\r\n\r\nit  is our hope that with patient education and time,\r\n\r\nwe  can  make  our people uphold higher standards  of\r\n\r\nsocial  responsibility in respect  of  public  health\r\n\r\nthan hitherto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to answer the irresponsible\r\n\r\nstatements  made  by the Member  for  Jurong  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech  of  9th  December pertaining  to  the  Health\r\n\r\nMinistry. According to the transcript of Hansard,  p.\r\n\r\n18, para. 6, line 4 [col. 161], he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Diseases like malaria, long unheard of in Singapore, are once again making their reappearance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Member  for  Jurong does not  know  what  he  is\r\n\r\ntalking about. Presence of mosquitoes alone does  not\r\n\r\nsignify  incidence of malaria, although  it  is  true\r\n\r\nthat  certain  types of mosquitoes can cause  malaria\r\n\r\nand  spread this disease. May I enlighten the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Jurong that the World Health Organisation regards\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  \"an  area in which  Malaria  has  been\r\n\r\neradicated\", unlike his homeland - Indonesia - and that\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  will  continue to  maintain  its  anti-malarial measures to the best of its ability to  keep\r\n\r\nup this good record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong again shows not only his utter\r\n\r\nignorance of the subject of El Tor Cholera  but  also\r\n\r\nstates  falsehoods (typical of all  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ntypes)  when he goes on further to say, according  to\r\n\r\nthe  transcript of Hansard, page 19, first paragraph,\r\n\r\nline 9 [col. 162]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With such a dangerous and infectious disease like\r\n\r\ncholera,  the  confirmed diagnosis of  two  cases  is\r\n\r\nsufficient to warrant the description of the  disease\r\n\r\nsituation  as  epidemic.  Yet  the  people  were  not\r\n\r\ninformed  of  the seriousness of the situation  until\r\n\r\nthere were 10 confirmed cases.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ever since the first bacteriological confirmed\r\n\r\ncase  of  El Tor Cholera was known on 13th  November,\r\n\r\n1963,  the  W.H.O. International Sanitary Regulations\r\n\r\nrequired  public  announcement  of  Singapore   being\r\n\r\ndeclared  a cholera infected port. This was  done  by\r\n\r\nGovernment Gazette Extraordinary No. 2774 of the same\r\n\r\ndate  and  this news was published in all newspapers,\r\n\r\nincluding   the  Chinese  newspapers,  the  following\r\n\r\nmorning.  With  every confirmed  case  or  discovered\r\n\r\n\"carrier\", there had not only been the usual  follow-up  \r\n\r\nof  public  health measures such as isolation  of\r\n\r\ndirect  contacts,  stoppage of  food  preparation  by\r\n\r\nhawkers  within  200 yards, sterilisation  of  wells,\r\n\r\ndisinfection of houses, etc. but a daily bulletin was\r\n\r\nalso  issued giving details of the residence and area\r\n\r\nof   every   confirmed  case  and  opening   of   new\r\n\r\ninoculation  centres to suit the convenience  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the first confirmed case was discovered,\r\n\r\nthe professional officers, i.e. qualified doctors  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry,  held  daily meetings  to  assess  the\r\n\r\nsituation.   Professor   Lim   Kok   Ann    of    the\r\n\r\nBacteriological  Department  of  the  University   of\r\n\r\nSingapore was present at these early meetings. During\r\n\r\nthe   first  few  days  it  was  the  view   of   the\r\n\r\nprofessional officers that as more than  1.2  million\r\n\r\nhave had inoculations only six months ago during  the\r\n\r\nMay  outbreak, the number of cases did not justify  a\r\n\r\ndecision  to launch another mass inoculation campaign\r\n\r\nuntil  19th  November  when  there  were  five  known\r\n\r\nconfirmed cases and four symptomless \"carriers\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision was then arrived at, too, that El Tor\r\n\r\nCholera  had come to stay in Singapore in an  endemic\r\n\r\nform  and that anti-cholera inoculations alone  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  good enough and that adequate and  effective\r\n\r\nPublic Health measures must be maintained throughout\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe year. It was then decided that a second mass\r\n\r\ninoculation  campaign should be  organised  with  the\r\n\r\nopening of more than 30 centres throughout the island\r\n\r\nas from 25th November. I am pleased to say that up to\r\n\r\ndate more than 700,000 have inoculated themselves  at\r\n\r\n33 free Government centres, and I hope that many more\r\n\r\nwill  take advantage of the free services offered  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  before  the month-long  mass  inoculation\r\n\r\ncampaign comes to an end, in three days' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to express my\r\n\r\nthanks  to  the  Council  of  the  Singapore  Medical\r\n\r\nAssociation for their co-operation in recommending to\r\n\r\ntheir members to charge only a nominal fee of $1 when\r\n\r\nusing free cholera vaccine from the Government during\r\n\r\nthe Mass Inoculation Campaign. I want also to express\r\n\r\nmy  deepest gratitude to the doctors associated  with\r\n\r\n32  private dispensaries for coming forward to assist\r\n\r\nthe  Government during this period. I understand that\r\n\r\nmany thousands have been so inoculated under the free\r\n\r\nGovernment  vaccine scheme. It is my hope  that  this\r\n\r\nwelcome  co-operation from our private  practitioners\r\n\r\nwill  be  extended to all fields, in order  that  the\r\n\r\nbest  possible medical service may be placed  at  the\r\n\r\ndisposal of our people in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to date there have been 24 confirmed cases and\r\n\r\n13  symptomless  carriers  - the  figure  13  is  very\r\n\r\nsymbolic - with two regrettable deaths. One was an 85-year old woman who was already in a state of collapse\r\n\r\nwhen admitted to Middleton Hospital and died within a\r\n\r\nfew hours, and the other a 56-year old man who was an\r\n\r\nopium addict and had, in addition, pneumonia as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Jurong says that two confirmed\r\n\r\ncases  of cholera means an epidemic, then I am afraid\r\n\r\nhe  has been wrongly advised by his Party doctors for\r\n\r\nnot keeping abreast with latest medical knowledge, as\r\n\r\nnot to be able to differentiate between classical  or\r\n\r\n\"Asiatic\"  cholera,  which is  a  more  virulent  and\r\n\r\nexplosive  type of cholera, commonly known in  India,\r\n\r\nfrom  El  Tor Cholera, which has now come to stay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. El Tor Cholera was first diagnosed in 1906\r\n\r\nin  Egypt from Mecca pilgrims. According to the World\r\n\r\nHealth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganisation,  16th  World Health  Assembly  held  at\r\n\r\nGeneva  in  May this year, Report No. 127  -page  31,\r\n\r\npara. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Committee recalls that in 1957, at the time of\r\n\r\nits  fifth  session and for some decades before  that\r\n\r\ntime, all reported cases of the disease due to El Tor\r\n\r\nvibrios  had been limited to the Celebes.  [That  is,\r\n\r\nIndonesia]  It  was on this basis that the  Committee\r\n\r\nwas  of  the opinion that this disease should not  be\r\n\r\nincluded in the term cholera, a quarantinable disease\r\n\r\nunder  the  International Sanitary  Regulations.  The\r\n\r\n11th World Health Assembly endorsed this opinion.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  was  only  in  May  1962 after  hearing  detailed\r\n\r\nreports  of several outbreaks of the El Tor infection\r\n\r\nin   Indonesia,  Sarawak,  Macao,  Hong   Kong,   the\r\n\r\nPhilippines  and North Borneo, and having  considered\r\n\r\nthe   views   of  the  experts  on  these  outbreaks,\r\n\r\nincluding the conclusions and recommendations of  the\r\n\r\nScientific Group on Cholera Research and the findings\r\n\r\nof  the meeting in Manila, that El Tor Cholera became\r\n\r\na  notifiable and a quarantinable disease. This  then\r\n\r\nis  the  situation in Singapore today.  There  is  no\r\n\r\ncause  for  panic  or alarm but of  determination  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  Public Health consciousness  of  everyone\r\n\r\nthroughout the State of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Sir, may I enlighten this House by\r\n\r\nquoting  a  further relevant extract from the  W.H.O.\r\n\r\nReport  again.  I  quote from page 37,  para.  48  on\r\n\r\nHongkong:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`During the period 1 July 1961 to 30 June 1962,\r\n\r\nHongkong  in  common with certain other countries  in\r\n\r\nthe  region  was  infected with cholera  El  Tor.  An\r\n\r\naccount   of  the  outbreak  in  Hongkong  has   been\r\n\r\npublished  as a White Paper and copies of this  White\r\n\r\nPaper  have  already been forwarded to  the  Director\r\n\r\nGeneral of WHO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the experience gained of the epidemiology of\r\n\r\ncholera  during  the  outbreak  in  Hongkong,  it  is\r\n\r\nsuggested   that  Articles  60  to  69, of   the\r\n\r\nInternational   Sanitary   Regulations   should    be\r\n\r\nreviewed. Despite the considerable powers conveyed by\r\n\r\nthese articles, it has not proved possible to prevent\r\n\r\nthe entry of Vibrio cholera infections into countries\r\n\r\nin  the  region  despite  rigid  application  of  the\r\n\r\nquarantine measures allowed by the Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the contact-carrier in the\r\n\r\ndissemination of cholera is not fully understood, but\r\n\r\nthere  is  evidence  to support  the  view  that  the\r\n\r\ncontact-carrier  without  clinical  symptoms  of  the\r\n\r\ndisease  may  be  the  agent  of  dissemination  from\r\n\r\ncountry   to  country,  particularly  those  contact-carriers moving by sea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  small vessels over short distances which  do  not\r\n\r\nnormally go through quarantine inspections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that the powers at present given\r\n\r\nunder  the Regulations are not wide enough to prevent\r\n\r\nthe dissemination of cholera.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of El Tor Cholera in Singapore today\r\n\r\ncan   be  said  to  be  similar  to  the  unfortunate\r\n\r\nexistence of Communists and Barisan Sosialis  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical field. Whereas the Barisan Sosialis can  be\r\n\r\nlikened  to  persons  suffering  from  diarrhoea   or\r\n\r\ndysentery  or even confirmed cases of El Tor  Cholera\r\n\r\nbecause  they are open front apologists for Communism\r\n\r\nfor  all to see, the really dangerous people are  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  who spread the doctrine of Communism,  of\r\n\r\nhatred,  evil and poison without disclosing who  they\r\n\r\nare  and  what  they  are. It  is  these  symptomless\r\n\r\ncarriers  like  El  Tor Cholera  carriers,  outwardly\r\n\r\nharmless  and  innocent  but  actually  sinister  and\r\n\r\ndangerous carriers of germs, disease and death,  that\r\n\r\nwe  must slowly and patiently ferret out, isolate and\r\n\r\nquarantine,  as  it were, so that  the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore may live in peace and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Jurong has seen fit to say that\r\n\r\n\"the  manner in which the Government has handled  the\r\n\r\ncholera  epidemic is deplorable\" (page 18 [col.  161]\r\n\r\nof the Transcript of Hansard). He even ended with the\r\n\r\nmuch   stronger  words  that  \"the  P.A.P. must   be\r\n\r\ncondemned for its criminal negligence in the handling\r\n\r\nof  the cholera epidemic\" (page 19 [col. 162]). As an\r\n\r\nelected  Minister  and charged by my  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwith  the  responsibility of being in charge  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health I accept full responsibility  for\r\n\r\neverything that is done or has failed to be  done  by\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry. I do not disappear and run into  hiding\r\n\r\nwhen things happen or appear to go wrong like two  of\r\n\r\ntheir so-called leaders - the Members for Nee Soon and\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh. Where are these so-called leaders?  Where\r\n\r\nare they? Sir, I am not in the least disturbed by the\r\n\r\nstrong language used by the Member for Jurong. It  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  people  of  Singapore and  the  responsible\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore to pass judgment on  me  or  my\r\n\r\nParty, which I am privileged to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if there is to be any condemnation in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  then  I  say we condemn the  treacherous  and\r\n\r\ntreasonable Barisan Sosialis and ask them  to  return\r\n\r\nto their homeland Indonesia where they belong!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> and <b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b> stood up ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, for giving me a chance to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, concerning the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech and the debate thereon up till  now, we  have  not  \r\n\r\nseen and we have not  heard  what  the P.A.P. Government \r\n\r\nhave advanced or what measures they have  given  to  us  \r\n\r\nto understand  in  tackling  the confrontation  policy. \r\n\r\nWhat they have been  doing  is\r\n\r\nall  the  time  blaming the Communists,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  It  is most regrettable that  no  one  has\r\n\r\ntaken  down how many times they have used the phrases\r\n\r\n\"Communists\",  \"Barisan Communists\"  and  so  on.  On\r\n\r\nmatters that affect the livelihood of the people, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Members have never said anything. Instead they\r\n\r\nput  all  the  blame  on  us.  They  blame  Soekarno,\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and the Barisan for the confrontation  and\r\n\r\nits consequent sufferings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now refute the arguments by the Ministers\r\n\r\nand  advance my reasons for doing so to show  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore that we are not smearing and  we\r\n\r\nare  not slandering or talking without any reason  or\r\n\r\nfact in support. Perhaps the P.A.P. Ministers may not\r\n\r\nwant to admit what I am going to say, but the man in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  street in Singapore knows what kind of  attitude\r\n\r\nthey have been adopting in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I want to deal with the smears made by the\r\n\r\nMinisters of the P.A.P. in this House. First of  all,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Punggol asked us to express our stand.\r\n\r\nHe  was  only taking the cue from the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nHe  had  nothing new to advance in this  House.  From\r\n\r\nwhat the Minister for Social Affairs has said in this\r\n\r\nHouse just now, I say there is no need to counter him\r\n\r\nin  my  reply because his speech is similar  to  that\r\n\r\nmade by the Minister for Culture. So I will now first\r\n\r\ndeal with the allegations of the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nagainst us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 11th of December and yesterday he tried his\r\n\r\nbest  to attack us. He used a very simple weapon - the\r\n\r\nterm  \"Communists\". He applied this term to  us,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Assemblymen. Playing on this  term,\r\n\r\nhe  thought that he could bamboozle the people by his\r\n\r\nlong  and  stinking speech, shouting and  yelling  at\r\n\r\nus.  We  were bored by his speech. I dare  say  that\r\n\r\nwithout  the  term \"Communists\", he  would  have  had\r\n\r\nnothing  to  say. The only thing he could talk  about\r\n\r\nwas  Communists, Communists, and Communism. His logic\r\n\r\nwas also absurd and ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried his best to put the blame of Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation  on  the  shoulders  of   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  On  the other hand, he tried to  whitewash\r\n\r\nthe  sufferings  and consequences  brought  about  by\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  the hatred of the people for  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  the P.A.P. He even tried to make good use of the\r\n\r\nhatred  of  the  people for the P.A.P. and  for  the\r\n\r\nsufferings  and  ill-consequences  brought  about  by\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  He  even made use of this hatred  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  put the blame on us in order  to  achieve\r\n\r\ntheir  purpose  of isolating us. He seemed  to  think\r\n\r\nthat by doing so he would be able to fix us, which is\r\n\r\nmere fantasy on his part. I would like to remind  him\r\n\r\nof  something, but unfortunately he is not here  now.\r\n\r\nIn  the  course of his speech, he forgot to hide  his\r\n\r\nfox-tail. He made very serious mistakes. He  admitted\r\n\r\nthat there have been economic difficulties after  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of Malaysia. And in his defence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  establishment of Malaysia, he said that  the\r\n\r\npurchasing  power and the standard of living  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  have  been  raised. He painted  a  very  rosy\r\n\r\npicture  of  Singapore. In doing so, he  exposed  the\r\n\r\nulterior motives for bringing about Malaysia, and  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  he  smeared all those  Parties  and\r\n\r\npeople  who  did  not agree with the  P.A.P.  In  our\r\n\r\nspeeches,  we have refuted his specious arguments.  I\r\n\r\nhad thought of asking the Minister one question but I\r\n\r\nam unable to do so now as he is not here. But I would\r\n\r\nask  him  not  to  waste  his  time  by  calling   us\r\n\r\n\"Communists\". It is futile. In his speech, which  was\r\n\r\nspecious  and incorrect, he harboured impure  motives\r\n\r\nand evil thoughts. I say that the true reason for the\r\n\r\neconomic  difficulties is the nature  of  reactionary\r\n\r\nMalaysia which has obstructed the development of  our\r\n\r\nnational  culture,  education and progress.  But  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture tried  to  put  the  blame  on\r\n\r\nothers. Yet in the end, he could not explain away all\r\n\r\nthese evil consequences of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> On a point\r\n\r\nof order.

That  is  why they  have  resorted  to  a\r\n\r\nslanderous  campaign  to distort  our  stand  and  to\r\n\r\nundermine us. That is why they have slandered  us  as\r\n\r\nagents of foreign powers. But their every attempt  to\r\n\r\nslander us is not convincing to the people. And  they\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  able  to  explain  away  their   own\r\n\r\narguments and who are really working for the  foreign\r\n\r\npowers.  The  cunning  and  sinister  attack  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture is clear to all. His\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildish   argument   cannot  deceive   people   with\r\n\r\npolitical common sense. The Barisan Sosialis stand is\r\n\r\nfor  the  people  of our country  and  we  place  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the people above everything else. What we\r\n\r\nhave  done in the past clearly shows that. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\naccuse  us  of being the so-called agents of  foreign\r\n\r\npowers in order to divert the attention of the people\r\n\r\nfrom  the  grave  economic problems of  our  country.\r\n\r\nEvery  one  knows  that  if a  country  achieves  its\r\n\r\npolitical independence without any economic  freedom,\r\n\r\nthis  sort of independence is not complete in  itself\r\n\r\nand there is a danger of the country being controlled\r\n\r\nand  manipulated by other powers. South  Vietnam  and\r\n\r\nThailand  are some examples of countries  which  have\r\n\r\nachieved  only political independence. We  hope  that\r\n\r\nthis Government will not follow the line of these two\r\n\r\ncountries  and induce foreign capital  to  put  up  a\r\n\r\nfacade of prosperity which will not help to solve the\r\n\r\nliving  problems  of our people. Instead,  they  will\r\n\r\nbring  hardship  and  disaster  to  our  people.  The\r\n\r\ninducement  of  foreign capital will only  result  in\r\n\r\nexploitation of our people. We cannot tolerate such a\r\n\r\ntype of policy. The P.A.P. persistently carry on with\r\n\r\nthis  policy.  They have unashamedly said  that  they\r\n\r\nwork for the people, but do you think that the people\r\n\r\ncannot  see  through their policy? The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  said that their loyalty is towards Malaysia.\r\n\r\nWe  believe that, but the P.A.P. are trying to  curry\r\n\r\nfavour with the reactionary cliques and their masters\r\n\r\nto  sell out the interests of the people. All the new\r\n\r\nemerging  forces have also made clear  their  stands,\r\n\r\nbut  these people have brought instability and  chaos\r\n\r\nto   South-East  Asia.  In  order  to   shift   their\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  the P.A.P. are trying  to  make  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  a scapegoat,  but  the  facts  are\r\n\r\nirrefutable.  They  try  to  mix  up  socialism  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  in  order to divert the attention  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  to  confuse their vision and  to  make  them\r\n\r\nforget  the real crux of the problem - that the  cause\r\n\r\nof our present difficulties has been brought about by\r\n\r\nthe  imperialists.  The  P.A.P. also  say  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan's  demand for the abolition  of  the  British\r\n\r\nmilitary bases here will pave the way for invasion by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother  foreign  power.

Therefore,  the  Minister  for   Culture\r\n\r\nshould not level all sorts of accusations against us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me refute his challenge. He has brought\r\n\r\nour  people  to the brink of war with our neighbours.\r\n\r\nMalaysia, which is designed to serve the interests of\r\n\r\nthe  imperialists, has brought about the  suppression\r\n\r\nand   exploitation   of  our  people,   tension   and\r\n\r\ninstability in South-East Asia. We should condemn the\r\n\r\nAlliance Government and the P.A.P. for having brought\r\n\r\nabout  this disastrous outcome. The diplomatic  break\r\n\r\nand  the  severance  of  trade between  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia  is  the result of their policy.  Factories\r\n\r\nhave  closed down and unemployment has increased.  We\r\n\r\nfeel  that, at the present juncture, the only way  to\r\n\r\nsolve  our problems is to open negotiations to  solve\r\n\r\nthe  differences peacefully. All those who shirk such\r\n\r\nresponsibilities do not help to solve our problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has challenged us to say\r\n\r\nwhether  we  hope  confrontation  will  succeed.  His \r\n\r\nargument does not merit our rebuttal. We want to  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nask   him  on  what  foundation  he  has  made   this\r\n\r\nallegation. Mr Speaker, Sir, in the first place,  we\r\n\r\nfully  realise that there has been a loss in  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  as  a  result of Malaysia.  We  also  fully\r\n\r\nappreciate that Malaysia is to serve the interests of\r\n\r\nthe   colonialists.  This  appreciation   should   be\r\n\r\naccepted, as this is the whole crux of the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture is afraid that the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore will see through Malaysia and his plot. \r\n\r\nSo  he has brought in other extraneous matters in his \r\n\r\nspeech in order to blind the vision of the people  of \r\n\r\nSingapore and to divert their attention from the crux \r\n\r\nof  the matter. The P.A.P. are now trying to push the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of an economic crisis  over  to  this\r\n\r\nside  of the House, namely, on the shoulders  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture is afraid that we want to\r\n\r\nexpose  the  whole matter, clearly and in detail,  to \r\n\r\nthe broad masses of the people. So he has brought  in \r\n\r\nthese extraneous matters in order to blind the vision \r\n\r\nof  the people. And we know what he is up to.  He  is \r\n\r\nmaking  this challenge in order to smear us as agents\r\n\r\nand  collaborators of foreign powers so that  he  can\r\n\r\npush the whole matter on to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has also attacked our\r\n\r\namendment  with a lot of intimidation as  though  the \r\n\r\nOpposition  Members  are  not  allowed  by   law   in \r\n\r\nSingapore  to  air  their views on  the  Government's \r\n\r\npolicies. He says that we are pro-Indonesia,  and  so \r\n\r\nwe should be charged with treason in court punishable\r\n\r\nby  death or life imprisonment. Does he mean that  we\r\n\r\nin  the  Opposition have no right  to  criticise  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policies in this Chamber? Everybody  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  knows  that Malaysia  is  a  new  form  of\r\n\r\ncolonialism brought about by the colonialists in this\r\n\r\npart  of the world. And now the P.A.P. are trying  in\r\n\r\nevery way to put through this neo-colonial plan.  Who\r\n\r\nis the traitor? Who has sold out the interests of the\r\n\r\npeople?  Who  is guilty of treason?  It  is  not  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis. In order to judge whether a  person\r\n\r\nis guilty of treason or not, we must know whether the\r\n\r\nacts committed by him are in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest of the people or against the interest of the\r\n\r\npeople.  You cannot judge whether a person is  guilty\r\n\r\nof  treason  or  not from the point of  view  of  the\r\n\r\nimperialists and colonialists. If you do so, then you\r\n\r\nare  a traitor and you are guilty of treason. If  you\r\n\r\ndisregard  the interest of the people, then  you  are\r\n\r\nnot  a  true  patriot.  Those  who  do  not  actually\r\n\r\nstruggle  for the genuine interest of the people  are\r\n\r\nthe  traitors.  So if the Minister for  Culture  says\r\n\r\nthat  anybody who votes for the amendment  tabled  by\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis will be guilty of treason  and\r\n\r\nperhaps be charged in court with treason and punished\r\n\r\naccording  to  the law, I say that this  is  a  grave\r\n\r\nthreat to the rights of parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We warn the Minister for Culture and the rest of\r\n\r\nthem  that  if  they  should persist  in  their  acts\r\n\r\nagainst the interest of the people and sell out their\r\n\r\nrights  to a foreign power, then the people will  one\r\n\r\nday  inflict on them serious punishment for what they\r\n\r\nhave  done.  History will prove that the people  will\r\n\r\npunish  the  real traitors - namely, the  P.A.P.  - who\r\n\r\nhave sold out the interest of the people to a foreign\r\n\r\npower. History will prove this to be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have dealt adequately with the speech of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture who barks like a dog at shadows.\r\n\r\nNow  we shall deal with the Prime Minister. As I have\r\n\r\nalready said, Mr Speaker, the Member for Punggol has\r\n\r\nmore or less echoed the speech of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nBut  we will not deal with what he has said. We  will\r\n\r\ngo  back to the root of the whole matter - namely,  the\r\n\r\nspeech of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister made his speech on\r\n\r\nthe  9th  of December this year. I wish to draw  your \r\n\r\nattention to the fact that he was incapable of saying \r\n\r\nanything new in his speech. He has repeated  his  old \r\n\r\narguments;  to put everything in a nutshell,  he  has\r\n\r\nbeen   trying  very  hard  to  smear  his   political\r\n\r\nopponents  and  those  who come  out  in  defence  of\r\n\r\nvernacular  education and the labouring class.  So  I\r\n\r\nwill  touch on his main points and give him  suitable\r\n\r\nreplies. From his speech, one can notice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseveral  main features. Perhaps the Back-benchers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government may not understand; so I wish to draw\r\n\r\ntheir attention to these main features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, the Prime Minister tried very\r\n\r\nhard  to  please the Malaysian Prime Minister,  Tunku\r\n\r\nAbdul Rahman. He attempted to compete for the Tunku's\r\n\r\nfavour  to  oust  the  M.C.A. in  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  In  fact, the Prime Minister has said  quite\r\n\r\nclearly  that he wishes to oust the M.C.A. from  the\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O./M.C.A./Alliance,  so  that  the  P.A.P. can\r\n\r\nreplace the M.C.A. in the Alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Prime Minister tried\r\n\r\nto show that the P.A.P. really had the support of the\r\n\r\npeople in the elections, thereby covering up the fact\r\n\r\nthat they had resorted to filthy means in the general\r\n\r\nelection to gain power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in his speech, it is clear that the\r\n\r\ndetermination   of   the   P.A.P. is   to   destroy\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. In this attempt, he tries to\r\n\r\nput  the  blame for the grave consequences  and  \r\n\r\nill-effects  of confrontation on his political  opponents\r\n\r\nand true patriots of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, it is the intention of the Government to\r\n\r\ntry  to  strangle Chinese education. We can see  very\r\n\r\nclearly what action the Government have taken against\r\n\r\nNanyang  University,  which is the  seat  of  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, it was also the intention of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in his speech to indulge in a dangerous game\r\n\r\nby  describing all those who come out in  defence  of\r\n\r\nChinese education as Communists, thereby whipping  up\r\n\r\nracial  feelings. He tries to whip up racial feelings\r\n\r\nover  educational  issues. The so-called  Citizenship\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committee is a  measure  by  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. desire to further control the daily lives  and\r\n\r\nfreedom  of the people of Singapore. He is doing  all\r\n\r\nthese  things in the name of Singapore. He  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  if in the town areas the election results  show\r\n\r\nthat the M.C.A. is no longer welcome and influential,\r\n\r\nthen  the  U.M.N.O. in the Alliance should reappraise\r\n\r\nthe situation with regard to the P.A.P. in Singapore.\r\n\r\nHe was not specific; he was very vague, but one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan   read  between  the  lines  to  find   out   his\r\n\r\nintentions.  He wants to try to kick out  the  M.C.A.\r\n\r\nfrom  the  U.M.N.O./ M.C.A./M.I.C.  Alliance  and  to\r\n\r\nreplace them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member is repeating what his other\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have  said, that the  Prime  Minister  is\r\n\r\ntrying to be the Prime Minister of the Federation and\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. are trying to take the place of  the\r\n\r\nM.C.A. Can we get on to something else?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I shall\r\n\r\ngo back to the main topic, but I have to reply to the\r\n\r\nsmears   made  by  the  P.A.P. against  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. Since you rule that this is repetitious,  I\r\n\r\nshall not dwell on it anymore. I am not going to  say\r\n\r\nany   more  about  the  P.A.P.'s  attempt   to   gain\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.'s favour in the Federation of Malaya, but  I\r\n\r\npersonally  feel that as far as we are concerned,  we\r\n\r\nshould  be  very frank in our political struggle.  We\r\n\r\nshould  not  try  to  be very vague  and  indulge  in\r\n\r\nsmearing others, particularly political opponents. We\r\n\r\nhave  to  adopt  a  spirit of  statesmanship  in  our\r\n\r\npolitical  struggle.  We cannot allow  ourselves  and\r\n\r\nothers  to  indulge in dirty political games.  Today,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister hopes very much to kick  out  the\r\n\r\nM.C.A. so that there can be more co-operation between\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. and the P.A.P. On the one hand, he tries  to\r\n\r\nsour  up  the relationship between U.M.N.O. and  the\r\n\r\nM.C.A., and, on the other hand, he tries very hard to\r\n\r\nplease  the Tunku and also his colleague,  Tun  Abdul\r\n\r\nRazak, with whom the P.A.P. are trying hard to  curry\r\n\r\nfavour.  But it is impossible for the P.A.P. to  kick\r\n\r\nout   the   M.C.A. from  the  U.M.N.O./M.C.A./M.I.C.\r\n\r\nAlliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member is back on the same theme.\r\n\r\nI  have just ruled him out of order. Can he get on to\r\n\r\nsome other subject?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This is very\r\n\r\nimportant, Mr Speaker, but I shall take your  advice\r\n\r\nand  forget about this. What I am going to say is  of\r\n\r\ngreat   importance.  The  Prime  Minister  has   said\r\n\r\nunashamedly  that the P.A.P. represent the  majority.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the P.A.P. represent the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajority  and  that  we, the Barisan,  represent  the\r\n\r\nminority,  and  we  should  be  banned.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  should  be  banned and  expelled  from  the\r\n\r\nChamber, but it is futile for the P.A.P. to make  use\r\n\r\nof some superficial figure to cover up the true facts\r\n\r\nof  the  situation.  If you are  not  forgetful,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  you will remember that in the last  general\r\n\r\nelection in South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem claimed that\r\n\r\nhe  had  a 99.8 per cent majority, and his wife  also\r\n\r\nclaimed that Ngo Dinh Diem was able to obtain a  99.9\r\n\r\nper  cent majority in the general election. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  who has not been able to obtain  99.9  per\r\n\r\ncent of the votes, compares himself with Ngo Dinh  Nu\r\n\r\nand Ngo Dinh Diem. But what are the facts? The people\r\n\r\nin  South Vietnam simply hate Ngo Dinh Diem  and  his\r\n\r\nregime  like poison. Yet Ngo Dinh Diem's  regime  has\r\n\r\nthe   audacity  to  claim  that  they  represent  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the people. Mr Speaker, we all  condemn\r\n\r\nthe  so-called  election that  took  place  in  South\r\n\r\nVietnam.  This  is sufficient to show  that  majority\r\n\r\nrepresentation and minority representation is  not  a\r\n\r\ncriterion on which the true wishes of the people  can\r\n\r\nbe measured. In some countries such as South Vietnam,\r\n\r\narrests are made of political opponents of the  Party\r\n\r\nin  power,  persecution is resorted to, and  all  the\r\n\r\nstate machinery is marshalled and made use of against\r\n\r\nthe  true  patriots  and the real  statesmen  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  In  spite of all these repressive  actions,\r\n\r\nthe  Party in power has the audacity to turn now  and\r\n\r\nsay  that they represent the majority of the people.\r\n\r\nWhat  a shame! In spite of what the P.A.P. have done,\r\n\r\nthey  can  only obtain less than 50 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nvotes cast in the general election, to say nothing of\r\n\r\ntheir  being able to obtain the majority  support  of\r\n\r\nthe   people.  In  spite  of  all  this,   they   say\r\n\r\nunashamedly that they represent the real majority  of\r\n\r\nthe people. Mr Speaker, although we were defeated in\r\n\r\nthe  general election we have to draw your  attention\r\n\r\nto  the  fact that the way in which the election  was\r\n\r\nconducted was unfair --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are not discussing the last\r\n\r\nelections.  Keep  on to the Negara's  speech.  I  had\r\n\r\noccasion  to rule before that we have had  enough  of\r\n\r\nthe elections. Go on to the Negara's speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I hope\r\n\r\nthat  you will bear with me because this is precisely\r\n\r\nthe  point mentioned in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech.  So we want to let the people know our  views\r\n\r\nof the results of the general election, otherwise the\r\n\r\npeople  might  be  misled by the  P.A.P.  It  is  our\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  as  Members of  the  Opposition,  to\r\n\r\nclear  up the position. We were able to poll  200,000\r\n\r\nvotes in the general election, and so we ask that our\r\n\r\nviews be respected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Prime Minister's speech, we were further\r\n\r\nsmeared  by him. He said that we tried to  pull  down\r\n\r\nthe pillars of parliamentary democracy. Now, this  is\r\n\r\na  smear  which  we have to squash.  It  is  not  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  which  desire  to  pull  down  the\r\n\r\npillars  of parliamentary democracy. In fact,  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  other  way round. It is the P.A.P. which  desire\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy to fail in this part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld. The P.A.P. are not prepared to face up to  the\r\n\r\nconsequences   of  their  action   in   breaking   up\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy in this island, and  so  they\r\n\r\ntry to put the blame on the Barisan Sosialis and make\r\n\r\nuse of this as an excuse to further persecute them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have banned the rural organisations and hawkers\r\n\r\nassociations? Who have resorted to violence to  break\r\n\r\nup  legitimate strikes? Who have assaulted non-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nelection workers? Who have prohibited and denied  the\r\n\r\npeople freedom of association, freedom of speech  and\r\n\r\nfreedom of publication? Who have sent Special  Branch\r\n\r\nmen  to  Nanyang  University to arrest  students  and\r\n\r\nundergraduates  and assault some undergraduates?  Who\r\n\r\nhave  exerted pressure on the Vice-Chancellor of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore? And who have  resorted  to\r\n\r\nundemocratic  means? Are these not  facts  enough  to\r\n\r\nshow   that   they  try  to  break  up  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy? This is what the P.A.P. have done. Or  can\r\n\r\none  say  that  it  has  been  done  by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis?  In  fact, their dirty game has  been  seen\r\n\r\nthrough by all concerned. As I have already said,  in\r\n\r\nspite  of all the futile means adopted by the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthey  can  only obtain less than 50 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nvotes.  In spite of their persecution of us,  we  are\r\n\r\nable to get more than 20 per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncent  of the votes cast in the general election. This\r\n\r\nis  a cause of great worry to the P.A.P. That is why,\r\n\r\nafter realising that it is futile to resort to humbug\r\n\r\nand   deceit  to  gain  further  support,  they   are\r\n\r\nresorting  to  further means by which  they  hope  to\r\n\r\ncrush their political opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. try to make use of legal means to\r\n\r\nfurther  control and squash political  opposition  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Now, this again is enough to show that  it\r\n\r\nis  the P.A.P. which desire to break up parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have to appeal to al the people in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  are  politically  conscious  to   pay\r\n\r\nattention to the damage that the P.A.P. have done  to\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have been very sarcastic about those who\r\n\r\nfight for Chinese education. In his speech, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has disclosed his hatred of those  Chinese-educated people and his intention to strangle Chinese\r\n\r\neducation in Singapore. He smears those who light for\r\n\r\nChinese  education and the cause of Chinese education\r\n\r\nas    traitors,   pro-Communist   and   anti-national\r\n\r\nelements. He even smears the Management Committee  of\r\n\r\nNanyang   University  and  tries  to  sour   up   the\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  the  teaching  staff  and  the\r\n\r\nManagement Committee of Nanyang University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his speech says that the\r\n\r\nappointment of members of the teaching staff is  good \r\n\r\nfor  only  one  year. That is why they do  not  enjoy \r\n\r\nsecurity in their appointments. That is why they  are \r\n\r\nnot  daring enough to come forward to defend academic \r\n\r\nfreedom.  So  he talks about security  of  tenure  of \r\n\r\nappointment as a means by which he wishes to sour the \r\n\r\nrelationship  between the teaching staff  of  Nanyang \r\n\r\nUniversity and the Management Committee of  the  same \r\n\r\nUniversity.  This again is enough to  show  that  the \r\n\r\nP.A.P. and  their  oligarchy will  not  hesitate  at\r\n\r\nanything  to  smear, to the fullest  extent,  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation,  Nanyang University and those  who  fight\r\n\r\nfor   the   interests  of  Chinese   education.   The\r\n\r\nreactionary  attitude of the P.A.P. in education  has\r\n\r\nbeen seen through by the people in Singapore. So  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of having put Chinese  schools  in  a\r\n\r\nprecarious position should be shifted from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. shoulders to somebody else's  shoulders.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why the P.A.P. are putting on the shoulders\r\n\r\nof  other people the responsibility of the failure of\r\n\r\nChinese education in its growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the P.A.P. wish very much to gain control\r\n\r\nof  Nanyang  University. This  is  a  fact  known  to\r\n\r\neverybody.  That  is  why  they  are  making  use  of\r\n\r\nfinances and economic aid against Nanyang University.\r\n\r\nThey  have  refused  to  recognise  the  degrees  and\r\n\r\nqualifications of Nanyang University. In spite of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's interference with academic  freedom  and\r\n\r\nautonomy  in Nanyang University, Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nshall   stand  unshaken,  Nanyang  University   shall\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   safeguard  the  interests   of   true\r\n\r\neducation.  Nanyang University will not allow  itself\r\n\r\nto  be swallowed up by the P.A.P. Nanyang University\r\n\r\nwill  never  allow itself to be made use of  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s party interest. All the persecution that Nanyang  University  has suffered at the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. must  receive  our  strongest  protest   and\r\n\r\ncondemnation. We shall go further into this matter in\r\n\r\nmy speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the intention of the Government to set up the Citizenship Consultative Committee is a measure by which the Government desire to further control the freedom of speech of the people, and the movements of the people in their daily lives. This is a measure of a feudalistic nature. The real purpose\r\n\r\nis  not  to  strengthen the relationship between  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  the Government. On the other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nreal  purpose is to further exploit the  freedom  and\r\n\r\nliberty of the people. This action of the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nbeen  exposed.  By  doing this, the  P.A.P. hope  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the people through those so-called  Citizens\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committees  by  using  them  as  their\r\n\r\nlackeys to get intelligence information through them,\r\n\r\nand  disseminate their propaganda through  them  too,\r\n\r\nbecause they can be made use of to deal with  and  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the people, and they will be making  use  of\r\n\r\nsome  nominal  heads  to manage these  committees  in\r\n\r\norder  to  achieve their purpose of  doing  harm  to\r\n\r\nothers  in  order to benefit themselves.  So  if  the\r\n\r\npeople suffer as a consequence of their rights being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninfringed,  then the P.A.P. oligarchy can turn  round\r\n\r\nand put the blame on those nominal heads. You can see\r\n\r\nthe  nature of P.A.P. oligarchy. This is their  usual\r\n\r\ntactic  - always  claim the merit for  themselves  and\r\n\r\nblame  others. These Citizens Consultative Committees\r\n\r\nwill become the intelligence centre of the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nwill be used as an instrument to further the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\ncontrol  over the people, and as a tool  to  restrict\r\n\r\nthe  rights and freedom of the people. They will thus\r\n\r\nbe a very convenient piece of machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the speeches made by the Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Education, we see that  they  have\r\n\r\nsmeared  the Chinese-educated and Chinese  education,\r\n\r\nas  well  as  those who are patriotic and sincere  in\r\n\r\ntheir  cause  for  national education.  We  can  well\r\n\r\nunderstand  the intrigues of the P.A.P. in  smearing\r\n\r\npatriotic educationists and Nanyang University.  They\r\n\r\ntry  to  sour  up  the  good  relations  between  the\r\n\r\nChinese,  Malays,  and  other racial  communities  in\r\n\r\norder   to   create  misunderstanding   among   these\r\n\r\ncommunities  against  us. So you  can  see  how  they\r\n\r\nmanage  to  sour  up the good relations  between  the\r\n\r\nMalay and Chinese communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said that Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  has  been  used to disseminate  Communist \r\n\r\ndoctrines,   and  the  Minister  for  Education   has \r\n\r\nmentioned  Chinese chauvinism together with Communism \r\n\r\nas  though the two words mean one and the same thing. \r\n\r\nHe  makes  use of Chinese education as the object  of\r\n\r\nhis attack, accusing it of being the cause of trouble\r\n\r\nand  disharmony. The attack on the so-called  Chinese\r\n\r\nchauvinism  and  the blame on the so-called  ignorant\r\n\r\npeople  have been made for obvious ulterior  motives.\r\n\r\nIf  the  P.A.P. oligarchy is like Don Quixote in  its\r\n\r\nattitude,  then its propaganda will be more glaringly\r\n\r\nexposed,  and  it will have to resort  to  more  mean\r\n\r\ntactics with worse results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Singapore we have a plural society of\r\n\r\nChinese, Indians, Malays, and others, and we  try  to\r\n\r\npersuade all these different races to live peacefully\r\n\r\nand harmoniously. We should also try to educate those\r\n\r\npeople  receiving education in the different language\r\n\r\nmedia to live peacefully and harmoniously and to  co-operate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith and understand one another. How is the education\r\n\r\npolicy  of the P.A.P. going to achieve these objects?\r\n\r\nHow  is  it going to succeed in uniting the different\r\n\r\nraces? The P.A.P. have put Chinese education in a bad\r\n\r\nlight  before the racial communities, and in the  end\r\n\r\nthey think that Chinese education can be destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smear, the mean tactics and dirty propaganda\r\n\r\nwill   only   serve  as  a  warning  to  the   racial\r\n\r\ncommunities,   and   it   will   only   lead   to   a\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding among the races and  cause  a  split\r\n\r\namong   them.   Have  the  P.A.P. considered   this\r\n\r\npossibility? I therefore say that this is a dangerous\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I have said just now is mainly directed at the Minister for Culture and the Prime Minister who have been accusing us of being anti-nationals and also smeared us with names. I say that the P.A.P. Government have not dealt properly with the question of confrontation and the sufferings\r\n\r\nthat  have  been brought to the people. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the P.A.P. Benchers have been trying to  evade\r\n\r\nthese questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the policy speech of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara as a whole, we can divide it into four points.\r\n\r\nOn  the  first point, we see that the speech  praises\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s so-called achievements. It has  ignored\r\n\r\nthe  serious  and evil consequences  that  have  been\r\n\r\nbrought  about  by  Malaysia and  has  forgotten  the\r\n\r\npeople's sufferings. It also tries to shift the blame\r\n\r\nfor  the  sufferings of the people brought  about  by\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  confrontation on  to  others  and  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government. It also tries to explain away the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  inability to deal with the problem  of  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood and living standards of the people and for\r\n\r\ntheir  betterment.  From this we  can  see  what  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are like. The people of Singapore  can  never\r\n\r\nforget  what  the P.A.P. have done to cause  them  to\r\n\r\nsuffer. The P.A.P. Government have been collaborating\r\n\r\nwith  British colonialists and the Central Government\r\n\r\nto  confiscate the property of trade unions and  have\r\n\r\narrested   their  leaders  and  also   banned   their\r\n\r\norganisations  and  increased  their  sufferings   to\r\n\r\nfurther  their  own  ends.  The  P.A.P.'s  deceptions\r\n\r\ncannot prevail forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They carried out a sham referendum on 1st September\r\n\r\nlast  year.  This  referendum, manipulated  by  them,\r\n\r\ncannot  be  conclusive. Do not think the  people  are\r\n\r\nfools.  The  people cannot tolerate this. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncannot  shirk  their responsibilities.  Malaysia  has\r\n\r\nbrought  a lot of suffering and difficulties  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The  P.A.P. are making use of the  bogey  of\r\n\r\nCommunism  to curb the reactions of the people.  They\r\n\r\nare  thus  taking action against the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nand those who are with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to talk now about building construction. Do\r\n\r\nnot think that by their propaganda on their so-called\r\n\r\nconstruction  work  they can  fool  the  people.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are trying to put up a show when they say they\r\n\r\nare carrying out construction work and other building\r\n\r\nactivities.  It  is  actually  a  facade.  It  is   a\r\n\r\ndeception  to  cover  up the difficulties  which  the\r\n\r\npeople are suffering. Are not these sufferings caused\r\n\r\nby  Malaysia? The Government's speeches are the  same\r\n\r\nas  those delivered previously. They are old speeches\r\n\r\nin a new bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk of the livelihood of the people as it\r\n\r\nexisted  before  and the conditions prevailing  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Many  merchants  have  suffered  in  their\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Many  workers have lost their  jobs.  Many\r\n\r\nindustries have had to regulate the number of  shifts\r\n\r\nfor  their  workers as a result of  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\nimported  materials. Some of them have been asked  to\r\n\r\nwork  only  for a few days in a week. Some  factories\r\n\r\nhave  had  to  close  down entirely.  The  industries\r\n\r\naffected  include those engaged in a rattan and  sago\r\n\r\nindustries. We can see this situation clearly  if  we\r\n\r\ngo  along the sea front and the Harbour Board. We can\r\n\r\nsee    from   this   situation   the   result   which\r\n\r\nconfrontation  has  brought  about  consequent   upon\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Much as I would like to enumerate all these\r\n\r\ninstances, I will not deal with them at length.  Many\r\n\r\nfactories  have  been  closed down  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nconfrontation.  Some of them are  Loo  Ee  Toh,  Hock\r\n\r\nSoon,  Yan Chuan, Chew Leong, Ho Kah Heng, etc.  They\r\n\r\nare  too numerous to enumerate. Thus, as a result  of\r\n\r\nconfrontation  which Malaysia has caused,  people  in\r\n\r\nall   walks   of   life   are  suffering.   This   is\r\n\r\nunprecedented  in the history of Singapore.  Most  of\r\n\r\nthe workers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nespecially   stevedores,  are   on   the   brink   of\r\n\r\nstarvation. Many workers were retrenched as a  result\r\n\r\nof  the  closing down of their factories.  There  are\r\n\r\nonly  a few workers who are given partial work.  Just\r\n\r\nlook at the empty vessels in the harbour. Look at the\r\n\r\nnumber of workers waiting along the quay queueing  up\r\n\r\nfor jobs. We can see from all this that the situation\r\n\r\nis  going  from bad to worse. There are  about  8,000\r\n\r\nworkers directly affected by confrontation. They  are\r\n\r\nnow  unemployed. The total number of people who  have\r\n\r\nlost their jobs as a result of confrontation may well\r\n\r\nbe   15,000.  These  are  workers  in  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nindustries  and trades. Some workers have  only  been\r\n\r\noffered  one  day's  work in  a  whole  week.  It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult for them to eke out a living like this  for\r\n\r\nthe  whole  month.  What about the workers  in  other\r\n\r\nindustries?  For instance, what about  those  in  the\r\n\r\nshoe-making  industry? According to  the  Government,\r\n\r\nonly  8,000  workers  have  been  out  of  job.  This\r\n\r\nstatement   is   deceiving  the  people.   They   are\r\n\r\nminimising the difficulties and hardships suffered by\r\n\r\nthe  people as a result of Malaysia. According to the\r\n\r\nMinister,  there  are about 40.000 to  50,000  people\r\n\r\nunemployed.  This is a very serious  social  problem.\r\n\r\nEvery year there are more and more school-leavers. On\r\n\r\ntop  of  this  problem,  Malaysia  has  brought  more\r\n\r\nhardship and suffering to the people. They are living\r\n\r\nlike ants in a hot pot. What are the Government going\r\n\r\nto  do  about  this?  This is a situation  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour has described as a  paradise  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia. He says this kind of  living  is  a\r\n\r\nparadise.  Perhaps we may not want to take his  words\r\n\r\nseriously,  because such utterances  have  also  been\r\n\r\nmade by ex-colonialists. Even the Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid that Singapore is a paradise in South-East Asia.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the Minister for Labour has avenues for  the\r\n\r\naccumulation of wealth.

Government have all along smeared us as  being\r\n\r\nCommunists,  and  because Indonesia  is  supposed  to\r\n\r\noppose Malaysia, so we must be opposing Malaysia. But\r\n\r\nthe  accusation will be exposed by the general masses\r\n\r\nof the people. They have challenged us to declare our\r\n\r\nstand.  Our stand is that of patriotism. We  are  for\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of all the people and  our  stand  on\r\n\r\nMalaysia is based on this patriotism. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nMinisters'  propaganda would in the end be  met  with\r\n\r\nbankruptcy. That is why, since they cannot succeed in\r\n\r\ntheir  propaganda, they will have to change the  tune\r\n\r\nof  their  speeches.  Their  lies  one  day  will  be\r\n\r\nexposed.  The  Minister for Labour has  been  putting\r\n\r\nforward his reasons which are absurd and childish. He\r\n\r\nsays  Indonesia is a sovereign country,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is  a  political Party in  Singapore.  What\r\n\r\nstrength   have  we  to  influence  the   policy   of\r\n\r\nIndonesia? The Minister for Labour is futile  in  his\r\n\r\nattempts. His reasons are not worth our rebuttal. Let\r\n\r\nus  hear  what he says about Indonesia  in  order  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the trade severance between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia. He says the Indonesian people have nothing\r\n\r\nto  eat. They have no clothes to put on and have been\r\n\r\neating  the bark of trees and rats. These are  common\r\n\r\noccurrences, he says. In Indonesia, he also says, the\r\n\r\nrupiah  is  not even worth a Japanese note.  He  also\r\n\r\ntalks  about  the  well-fed leaders  who  ignore  the\r\n\r\nstarvation  of their subjects.

We\r\n\r\nmust   negotiate  with  them  peacefully.   But   the\r\n\r\nMinister's  attitude is not so. He  gloats  over  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties suffered by the Indonesian people.  This\r\n\r\nwill only make matters worse. This is not the way  to\r\n\r\nbring  about  good  relations between  Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nSingapore. The Prime Minister has said that  we  must\r\n\r\nresume relations between Indonesia and Singapore, but\r\n\r\nthe Minister's speech will only result in a worsening\r\n\r\nof relations. As the Government of Singapore, we have\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  urge the Central Government  to  open\r\n\r\nnegotiations with Indonesia, so the State  Government\r\n\r\nhas  the night to urge the Central Government. It  is\r\n\r\nour   responsibility.  Therefore,  the  Minister  may\r\n\r\nattack Indonesia but he must also consider the people\r\n\r\nwho are affected by the severance in trade. Factories\r\n\r\nhave to be reopened and the workers have to get jobs.\r\n\r\nThe  Government must seek ways and means  to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  situation.

Why should you repeat the\r\n\r\nspeeches  of  the  Prime  Minister?  Because  of  the\r\n\r\ntension  brought about by Malaysia,  the  people  are\r\n\r\nsuffering a lot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  they  are  miserable.  The  merchants  have   no\r\n\r\nbusiness; the workers have no jobs and they  have  to\r\n\r\nface  resistance from the people of Borneo. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has told us that Malaysia has brought  peace\r\n\r\nand  happiness to ten million people who will be able\r\n\r\nto  lead  a happy, prosperous and peaceful life.  The\r\n\r\npresent  situation  is a slap  in  the  face  of  the\r\n\r\nreactionary clique. So they are now trying  to  shift\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility for the present difficulties  and\r\n\r\nhardship on to others as they are not able to account\r\n\r\nfor the present difficulties. Therefore, they have to\r\n\r\nfind  a  way  out  to  deceive the  people.  That  is\r\n\r\nshirking their responsibility. They realize that they\r\n\r\nhave  collaborated with the British  imperialists  to\r\n\r\nsponsor  Malaysia. The Prime Minister has  given  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  reasons, such as that Indonesia has  about\r\n\r\n400,000 troops who are well armed, that Malaysia  has\r\n\r\nvery  few troops and that the population of Indonesia\r\n\r\nis  bigger than that of Malaysia. Now on the  9th  of\r\n\r\nDecember, the Minister for Labour repeated  the  same\r\n\r\nargument.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  when   one   country\r\n\r\nthreatens   another  country,  the  size   of   their\r\n\r\nrespective populations need not be a deciding factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>00.01 a.m., 19-12-63\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Japan with a population of 90 million\r\n\r\npeople was able to conquer China with a population of\r\n\r\nnearly 500 million people, and Britain with a smaller\r\n\r\npopulation than India was able to conquer India. This\r\n\r\nwas because they pursued aggressive policies. Britain\r\n\r\nwas the oldest empire --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are not speaking of Britain\r\n\r\nand Japan. The hon. Member needs only one example  to\r\n\r\nmake  his  point.

He has been on the Floor for  one  and  a\r\n\r\nhalf  hours, and I think, in fairness to both  sides,\r\n\r\nhe  should  try to wind up his speech. We  have  been\r\n\r\nhere  from half-past two in the afternoon. I hope  he\r\n\r\nwill  try his best. I want to be fair to both  sides,\r\n\r\nbut  we  cannot go on forever, otherwise the standard\r\n\r\nof debate in this House will deteriorate. I would ask\r\n\r\nhim to try to wind up his speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): All right, I will\r\n\r\nnot  touch on this any more. Let me touch on a graver\r\n\r\nproblem.  From the debate in the past three days,  it\r\n\r\nseems  that  the  P.A.P. have tried  to  shift  their\r\n\r\nresponsibility and that they dare not face up to  the\r\n\r\nstark reality. We will prove that they have done  bad\r\n\r\nthings    and    that   they   dare   not    shoulder\r\n\r\nresponsibility. I want to put forward these facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the P.A.P. came to power, what have they\r\n\r\ndone?  As far as I know, their first misdeed  was  to\r\n\r\ndeprive  Mr Tan Lark Sye of his citizenship  - a  man\r\n\r\nwho  has  contributed a lot towards the  building  of\r\n\r\nNanyang University. The leadership of the P.A.P. did\r\n\r\nnot   consider  the  adverse  consequences  of  their\r\n\r\nruthless measure in depriving him of his citizenship.\r\n\r\nThey think that because they were elected in the last\r\n\r\nelection, the people will support their misdeeds.  So\r\n\r\nthey  think  that  they can do what  they  like  now.\r\n\r\nVictory  has  gone  to their heads.  They  have  been\r\n\r\narrogant.  During the last election, the  people  who\r\n\r\nvoted  for  them  did not return  them  to  power  to\r\n\r\ndeprive Mr Tan Lark Sye of his citizenship. If  they\r\n\r\npersist  in  their barbaric misdeeds, I believe  that\r\n\r\nthose  who  supported  them  in  the  past  will  not\r\n\r\ntolerate  them. They put the P.A.P. in power  because\r\n\r\nthey  want them to do good things and not bad things.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. have disregarded the liberty  and  other\r\n\r\nbasic   human  rights  of  the  people.   They   have\r\n\r\ncollaborated with the Federation police to launch  an\r\n\r\nattack  on  Nanyang University. Soon after  depriving\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  Lark Sye of his citizenship, the Federation\r\n\r\npolice  launched an attack against Nanyang University\r\n\r\nand arrested the students, in addition, they banned 7\r\n\r\ntrade unions in Singapore. The general strike for two\r\n\r\ndays  in  protest against the Government  action  was\r\n\r\nbroken  up  by the Government by repressive measures.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  this  general protest strike  was  brought\r\n\r\nabout  by  the  repressive actions of the  Government\r\n\r\nwhich forced the workers to go on strike. The workers\r\n\r\nhad to take strike action in order to safeguard their\r\n\r\nown interests and the existence of the organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

He has had the Floor for  more\r\n\r\nthan one and a half hours. If he is going to bring up\r\n\r\nfresh  matters, I am prepared to hear him, but if  he\r\n\r\nis going to talk of the strike of which we have heard\r\n\r\nso much, I think it is a waste of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): So it is\r\n\r\nregrettable that when the reactionary Alliance in the\r\n\r\nFederation  is making inroads into the liberties  and\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  the people of Singapore, the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\ntrying to ignore these facts. Instead, the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nassisting   the   Federation   Government   and   its\r\n\r\nreactionary  Alliance to take action against  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  against those who do not  endorse  their\r\n\r\npolicies.  These  actions  are  only  taken  in   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  Devan Nair and his trade  union.  They\r\n\r\nhave  forgotten entirely their promises made  to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. They have promised the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore that if the Federation interfere  with  the\r\n\r\nfundamental  rights of the people of Singapore,  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  compromise with the Federation of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nand  the Singapore Government will defend the  rights\r\n\r\nof  the  people. This is what has been  said  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister. But when these things do happen, they\r\n\r\nresort to the cheap propaganda that it is due to  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  created by the Communists that  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment have to take certain actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the P.A.P. have turned now to speak in defence\r\n\r\nof the Federation action, instead of fighting for the\r\n\r\ninterests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the people in Singapore as they have promised. To\r\n\r\nput  everything in a nutshell, the P.A.P. are  trying\r\n\r\nto  make  use  of their powers to ensure  that  their\r\n\r\npolitical  position will be perpetuated.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  forgotten  the promise made to  the  people  to\r\n\r\nfight  for  their fundamental rights.  They  are  now\r\n\r\nacting  in  collaboration and in collusion  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government against the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. We must tell the leaders of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. that in so doing they have been very foolish,\r\n\r\nand  this has been too much on the part of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto have done so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we do not deny that the P.A.P. have a\r\n\r\nmajority vote in this House, they cannot make use  of\r\n\r\nthis  majority to trample over the fundamental rights\r\n\r\nof  the  people  in Singapore, and the P.A.P. should\r\n\r\nnever be allowed to make use of this majority in this\r\n\r\nHouse to destroy parliamentary democracy. As we  have\r\n\r\nalready  said,  in  so  far as Singapore's  political\r\n\r\ncontrol is in the hands of the Federation reactionary\r\n\r\nelements,  then the fundamental rights of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore will be destroyed and undermined. I lay\r\n\r\nall  these facts before you to prove the truth of our\r\n\r\nwarning  that  we  gave quite a long  time  ago.  The\r\n\r\ncontempt  that  the  P.A.P. have  for  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy and for the basic rights of the people  can\r\n\r\nbe  seen  clearly  in  recent developments  and  this\r\n\r\ncontempt will give rise to widespread dissatisfaction\r\n\r\namong  the  people. There will come a  day  when  the\r\n\r\npeople will rise up to defend and fight for their own\r\n\r\nrights.  In  the  struggle for  their  liberties  and\r\n\r\nfreedom and personal security, the workers, the under-graduates   and  other  people  have   been   branded\r\n\r\nCommunists.  This is the usual tactic which  deserves\r\n\r\nno  repetition.  The people of Singapore  will  never\r\n\r\nendorse  the policies of the P.A.P. Government  which\r\n\r\nare detrimental to the people's interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to ask a question, that is, whether the\r\n\r\nrights of the 60,000 workers in these two unions  can\r\n\r\nbe denied and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nignored.  Why should not a certain amount of  respect\r\n\r\nbe  given to the rights of the workers and why should\r\n\r\nthe rights of those arrested be denied?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang University problem is again a knotty\r\n\r\nquestion  that worries the Government. In failing  to\r\n\r\nsolve   this  problem,  they  have  taken  repressive\r\n\r\nactions  against certain Nanyang undergraduates,  and\r\n\r\nin  trying  to  destroy academic  freedom  they  have\r\n\r\narrested certain under-graduates. What is the ulterior\r\n\r\nmotive behind all these repressive actions? Have they\r\n\r\nany  conscience  at all? We must point  out  that  if\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy is  not  respected,  if  the\r\n\r\npersonal freedom and security of the people and human\r\n\r\nrights  are  not respected, then it is  difficult  to\r\n\r\nhave peace and harmony in this country. The blame for\r\n\r\ndisharmony and possible unrest in this country should\r\n\r\nbe  placed  squarely  on those  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nrepressive   actions   which   seek   to   break   up\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. As the saying goes, there is\r\n\r\nno  smoke without fire. If there is no action  coming\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Federation against the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and if the P.A.P. have not failed to  defend\r\n\r\nthe  rights  of the people in the face of  Federation\r\n\r\ninterference, then there will not have been  so  much\r\n\r\ntrouble. So to ensure peace and harmony in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore should be given  sufficient\r\n\r\ndemocracy and freedom to exercise their rights. It is\r\n\r\nonly  when the people have certain democratic rights,\r\n\r\nit  is  only when the democratic rights of the people\r\n\r\nhave  been given the minimum respect, that peace  and\r\n\r\nharmony can ever exist in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is most improper to give democratic rights only\r\n\r\nto  a minority group of people to enable them to boss\r\n\r\nover  the  majority of the people. If  this  happens,\r\n\r\nthen  there  will not be any peace in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. do not appreciate the truth of this thesis and\r\n\r\npretend  not to know about it. In fact, they  try  to\r\n\r\nput aside the indestructible truth of this thesis. It\r\n\r\nis  our  duty to present the true facts to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand to the people,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that all concerned will wake up one day to  take\r\n\r\npart in the struggle to safeguard their basic rights.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only  when the people's rights are  respected\r\n\r\nthat there will be peace. Those who deliberately  try\r\n\r\nto  distort  facts  and put aside the  truth  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation  should  be  exposed.  Their  true  colours\r\n\r\nshould  be shown up. They should be dealt with.  Then\r\n\r\nthey will have to bow to the will of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. are now undermining the rights of the\r\n\r\npeople.  The  Government  have  every  intention   to\r\n\r\ndestroy the progressive forces in Singapore in  order\r\n\r\nto   consolidate  their  own  reactionary  forces  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   These  unreasonable   actions   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Alliance can only be  frustrated  by  the\r\n\r\nstrong  will  of  the people. In order  to  safeguard\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy and the fundamental rights of\r\n\r\nthe people, we have to unite together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 16th of September, 1963, the Federation of Malaysia was forced through as a result of collusion among the P.A.P., the Federation of Malaya, and the British. In this new Federation, although it appears that the British colonialists no longer hold the reins of government, in actual fact,\r\n\r\nthe  rights  and powers are still controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nBritish through the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

I must ask him to get on\r\n\r\nto something new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, let me\r\n\r\nconclude  briefly. I would like to  enumerate  a  few\r\n\r\nfacts  to show that actually there has been no change\r\n\r\nat  all  after  Malaysia. Economically  speaking  the\r\n\r\nBritish  colonialist position is  still  consolidated\r\n\r\nand  they still maintain their bases through the  so-called   Anglo-Malaysian   Defence   Treaty.    Their\r\n\r\ninfluence  and  power have not been  touched  in  the\r\n\r\nleast. Even the Australian and the New Zealand armies\r\n\r\nare  making use of our land as their bases. They  are\r\n\r\ndriving their military trucks on our roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEATO was not established to serve and maintain the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  people in this  region.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmilitary  alliance of foreign countries. The  British\r\n\r\nare   clever  in  manipulating.  Through  the  Anglo-Malaysian  Defence  Treaty,  the  British  can  still\r\n\r\nmaintain  their  interests in  South-East  Asia.  The\r\n\r\nMalaysian Government are serving the British by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  treaty. The countries affected are still  in  a\r\n\r\nstate  of  submission, economically  and  militarily.\r\n\r\nThis  does not help to maintain peace in this region,\r\n\r\nand  it  is not in our interest. Our stand  on  anti-colonialism  is  directed  at  getting  rid  of  this\r\n\r\nposition  of subjection to the military  might  of  a\r\n\r\nforeign power, and securing true peace, happiness and\r\n\r\nprosperity  for  the people in this  region.  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  said that actually there has been no  change\r\n\r\nin  the  situation after Malaysia. Only the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation  will prove whether our country now  is  an\r\n\r\nindependent sovereign country. Britain has  still  an\r\n\r\neconomic hold on our rich resources, such as  rubber,\r\n\r\ntin,  palm oil and other products and they are  still\r\n\r\nin  control  of  communications,  trade,  import  and\r\n\r\nexport firms, banking and insurance which have always\r\n\r\nbeen  monopolised  by the British  colonialists.  The\r\n\r\neconomic power structure is still in the hands of the\r\n\r\nBritish colonialists. Although independence has  been\r\n\r\nachieved, yet the economic situation has not  changed\r\n\r\nat   all;  the  position  is  still  the  same.   The\r\n\r\nplutocratic  economic exploitation has not  been  got\r\n\r\nrid  of yet. The livelihood and living conditions  of\r\n\r\nour  farmers  and  fishermen still remain  the  same.\r\n\r\nThere  has  been no improvement at all. The  Alliance\r\n\r\nCentral Government in encouraging foreign monopolists\r\n\r\nand  capitalists  to come here and  compete  in  this\r\n\r\nexploitation  are  still not  checked.  Although  the\r\n\r\ninvestments  by  foreign capitalists and  monopolists\r\n\r\nhave  contributed to the superficial prosperity, this\r\n\r\nis  detrimental  to an independent sovereign  country\r\n\r\nbecause  it  will only make our country dependent  on\r\n\r\nforeign economic support. Is this the kind of  policy\r\n\r\nthat  should  be pursued by an independent  sovereign\r\n\r\ncountry?

On  the\r\n\r\none hand, the Constitution provides us with our basic\r\n\r\nliberty and human rights; on the other hand,  it  has\r\n\r\ntaken  back  all these rights.

Politically, there has  been  no\r\n\r\nchange.  Although  we  have  a  new  nation,  a   new\r\n\r\nconstitution, we have inherited things that were left\r\n\r\nby the colonial government in the past, including the\r\n\r\nlaws. We wait to stress and reiterate our stand  when\r\n\r\nwe  opposed Malaysia in the past. Before Malaysia and\r\n\r\nmerger,  our Party pointed out that if Malaysia  were\r\n\r\nto be pushed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough,  it  would bring suffering and disaster;  if\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia were to be forced  through,  it\r\n\r\nwould  only  bring hardship, because the concept  and\r\n\r\nscheme  of  Malaysia  had been sponsored  by  British\r\n\r\nimperialism.  Therefore, the P.A.P. have  helped  to\r\n\r\nimpose  Malaysia. What happens now? The  things  that\r\n\r\nhave  happened  are the result of the  imposition  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Our prognosis has been correct, and  recent\r\n\r\nhappenings have proved this. The people have suffered\r\n\r\nas a result of merger and Malaysia and confrontation.\r\n\r\nI  fully  support the amendment tabled by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>00.35 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> There are many ways of\r\n\r\nchanging a ten-dollar note.

It is customary in many parts of the world to attribute blame for many things on workers. It appears to me that we in Singapore are no exception, as that is the only inference that I can draw from\r\n\r\nthe  remarks  that inadequate methods of  supervision\r\n\r\nresulting in indiscipline among public health workers\r\n\r\ntogether   with  the  existence  of  secret   society\r\n\r\nelements  in  their  midst  have  contributed  to  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in rubbish, so that they cause a menace  to\r\n\r\nhealth  in Singapore. Being directly associated  with\r\n\r\nthe  workers  of  Singapore, I wish  to  emphatically\r\n\r\nrefute  such allegations. The blame for the state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  in  public health, particularly relating  to\r\n\r\nthe  cleansing  of  the  city, cannot  be  attributed\r\n\r\neither   to  the  indiscipline  of  labour   or   its\r\n\r\ninefficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on the remarks about secret\r\n\r\nsociety  elements  in  the  midst  of  public  health\r\n\r\nworkers   in   Singapore.   Whatever   may   be   the\r\n\r\nshortcomings of the pro-national labour in Singapore.\r\n\r\nsurely  the House will appreciate that we  differ  at\r\n\r\nleast  in this respect from the anti-national  unions\r\n\r\nof  the  S.A.T.U. group who have never  hesitated  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  such  elements - I mean the secret  society\r\n\r\nelements - to force\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers into participating in anti-national political\r\n\r\nstrikes.  Anyone acquainted with workers in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  recall  that the 1961 strike of these  workers,\r\n\r\nunlike  the  many strikes in the S.A.T.U. group,  did\r\n\r\nnot  result in any free-for-all. Despite considerable\r\n\r\ndelay in the implementation of the terms of agreement\r\n\r\narising from this strike, public health workers  have\r\n\r\nshown  considerable restraint over the last two years\r\n\r\neven to the extent of agreeing to the setting up of a\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry to settle unresolved  issues.\r\n\r\nAll  these can only speak well for the restraint  and\r\n\r\npatience  shown by cleansing and other public  daily-rated  workers,  a situation hardly possible  had  it\r\n\r\nbeen  true that secret society elements were  working\r\n\r\nin their midst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the defects in this field of public\r\n\r\nhealth,  particularly that relating to the  cleansing\r\n\r\nof the city, must be squarely placed on the shoulders\r\n\r\nof  the  Member  for Hong Lim who, during  his  short\r\n\r\nreign  as Singapore's one and only Mayor, did lasting\r\n\r\ndamage  to  our  record as one of  the  cleanest  and\r\n\r\nhealthiest  cities of Asia - nay, the world.  With  his\r\n\r\nadvent,  orders for the purchase of new vehicles  for\r\n\r\nthe  cleansing  and  other public  health  work  were\r\n\r\ncancelled; existing vehicles were deployed from other\r\n\r\npurposes,  and even the incinerator was closed  down.\r\n\r\nThe  consequence was that refuse had to be dumped  in\r\n\r\nopen spaces, even in the frontage of the labour lines\r\n\r\nand  housing  settlements,  and  this  is  still  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Singapore. Thus,  by  the  dumping  of\r\n\r\nrefuse,  delays  in removal caused  by  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nnecessary  equipment and a host of many other  things\r\n\r\nhave contributed to this vicious cycle of disease  - I\r\n\r\nmean refuse, flies and diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say that the position is even worse today.\r\n\r\nAbout 29,000 houses have been built since 1959,  many\r\n\r\nmiles  of  new  drains  and  roads  constructed,  new\r\n\r\nschools  built for the increasing number  of  school-going  children,  large numbers of people,  including\r\n\r\nroom   dwellers  moving  into  separate  houses   and\r\n\r\nestablishing  separate  households  and   a   general\r\n\r\nexpansion of social services in Singapore since 1959.\r\n\r\nIt  is  all well known to the Members of this  House,\r\n\r\nboth the Opposition and the Government. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsequence of all this is that the amount of  refuse\r\n\r\nhas  increased,  and  all this  calls  for  a  larger\r\n\r\ncleansing labour force and more and better equipment.\r\n\r\nWhat do we really have in their place? We have merely\r\n\r\nan  additional  200 workers over and above  the  1958\r\n\r\nlabour  force. We have vehicles, thanks to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong Lim, which operate 12 to 14 hours  per  day\r\n\r\nover considerable distances with frequent breakdowns,\r\n\r\ndust-bins despite the considerable public money spent\r\n\r\nby  the then City Council are no longer adequate  but\r\n\r\nusable.  In some places dust-bins with their  bottoms\r\n\r\nabout to fall off are issued to cleansing workers for\r\n\r\ntheir work. Despite these handicaps and difficulties,\r\n\r\nI  must say the workers of the cleansing section  are\r\n\r\ndoing a magnificent job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I regret that no recognition has been paid to\r\n\r\nthese   workers  for  their  services   under   these\r\n\r\nhandicaps. I, therefore, ask this House to judge  the\r\n\r\nremarks  regarding  labour's  contribution   to   the\r\n\r\nuncleanliness of the city in the light of what I have\r\n\r\nsaid. What the situation really calls for is to  find\r\n\r\nways  and means of improving the cleanliness  of  the\r\n\r\ncity,  and  I  say the answer lies not  in  assigning\r\n\r\nblame  to the workers, but in the provision  of  more\r\n\r\nvehicles  for the transportation of refuse, a  larger\r\n\r\nwork   force,   and  a  trained  set   of   frontline\r\n\r\nsupervisors,  not  those who will  brow-beat  workers\r\n\r\nwithout  regard to the difficult circumstances  under\r\n\r\nwhich  they are required to work. Nobody has  thought\r\n\r\nfit  to  look into the methods nor the efficiency  of\r\n\r\nthose in charge of public health in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent Commission of Inquiry into the Public\r\n\r\nDaily-Rated  Employees reveals a  shocking  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs. The cross-examination of the Health Ministry\r\n\r\nby  a  genuine trade unionist, Mr C. V. Devan  Nair,\r\n\r\nshowed  up  a  set of anti-labour officials  in  that\r\n\r\nMinistry  who  showed a greater  knowledge  of  anti-labour  theories  than that of  the  requirements  of\r\n\r\npublic  health.  I hope that before  making  sweeping\r\n\r\nremarks about workers, the authorities concerned will\r\n\r\ntake  the trouble to study the shortcomings of  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  supposed to be in charge of public  health.\r\n\r\nThere are more flies, mosquitoes and rubbish today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly  the  workers are responsible? That is  rubbish!\r\n\r\nOnly the officials in the Ministry of Health who have\r\n\r\nmismanaged  public  health and systematically  misled\r\n\r\ntheir  Ministers will dare say so. I  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take a fair and objective view  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation in public. The workers may not be  entirely\r\n\r\ninnocent  of the responsibility, but the major  guilt\r\n\r\nlies   elsewhere.  It  lies  with  those   who   have\r\n\r\nsystematically mismanaged public health. It lies with\r\n\r\nthe rat-racing, responsibility-dodging, union hating,\r\n\r\nand  blame-throwing bunch of inefficient buffoons who\r\n\r\nstaff  the Ministry of Health. The Public Daily-Rated\r\n\r\nEmployees  Federation,  which represents  the  Public\r\n\r\nDaily-Rated Employees in Singapore, have assured  the\r\n\r\nNational  Trades Union Congress that they  will  give\r\n\r\ntheir full co-operation in improving public health in\r\n\r\nSingapore, but co-operation is not a one-way traffic.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  two-way  traffic.  There  must  be  mutual\r\n\r\naccommodation  between  workers  and  officials   and\r\n\r\nmutual  efforts  towards improving public  health  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I warn the Barisan Sosialis in this House that\r\n\r\nour criticism of the Government is not an act of anti-national  and  Soekarno-loving inclination?  This  is\r\n\r\ndemocracy  at work, and it is the only way to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat democracy does work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his speech the Head of State has also stressed the importance of the Industrial Arbitration Court in bringing about stable industrial relations in Singapore. We in the N.T.U.C. fully endorse this hope of the Government. But it is necessary to point out that the Government's hopes\r\n\r\nand our hopes about industrial relations in Singapore\r\n\r\nmay  be  defeated if shortcomings in  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Ordinance  are not removed.  For  example,\r\n\r\nsection  77  of the Ordinance provides penalties  for\r\n\r\nemployers  who  dismiss  or  victimise  employees  by\r\n\r\nreason  of  the  circumstance that  they  join  trade\r\n\r\nunions.  But so far, these penalties have never  been\r\n\r\nenforced.  Why  have they never been  enforced?  When\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  break  the law,  they  are  hauled  up\r\n\r\nquickly enough. Why is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  law  not  quick enough to punish  employers  who\r\n\r\noffend against the law? In the last one year about 15\r\n\r\nemployers have violated section 77 of the I.R.O.  All\r\n\r\nthe  facts  have  been given to the  State  Advocate-General.  But to date not a single employer has  been\r\n\r\nprosecuted Trade unions are, therefore, justified  in\r\n\r\nexpressing   dissatisfaction  with  this   state   of\r\n\r\naffairs.  What is the use of the law  if  it  is  not\r\n\r\nenforced?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis will say that the law is not\r\n\r\nenforced against employers because the Government  is\r\n\r\npro-employer. That is rubbish. No worker in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  believe  that the Government  is  pro-employer.\r\n\r\nWhat  then  has  gone wrong? It is simply  this:  the\r\n\r\nmachinery  for the enforcement of the law has  proved\r\n\r\nto  be  grossly  inadequate. An  employer  sacks  his\r\n\r\nemployees because they have joined a trade union. The\r\n\r\nunion,  under the present regulations, must  complain\r\n\r\nto  the police. The police then send their reports to\r\n\r\nan  over-worked S.A.G. The over-worked S.A.G. has  no\r\n\r\ntime to deal with these reports because he is deluged\r\n\r\nwith  other  responsibilities. Now,  why  should  the\r\n\r\npolice  have anything to do with industrial offences?\r\n\r\nIndustrial offences are not criminal offences.  Would\r\n\r\nit  not  be better for a legal officer to be attached\r\n\r\nto  the Ministry of Labour, whose sole responsibility\r\n\r\nwould  be  to  take  charge  of  the  prosecution  of\r\n\r\nindustrial   offences?   Speed   is   essential   for\r\n\r\nindustrial  justice.  You cannot  be  slow  in  these\r\n\r\nmatters  without  disillusioning  workers  about  the\r\n\r\nrights  conferred on them under the  law.  I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  Government really  want  to  establish\r\n\r\nindustrial justice, then the machinery for  enforcing\r\n\r\nthe law must be thoroughly overhauled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a recent example of how an employer\r\n\r\ndeliberately  violated section 77 of the  I.R.O. and\r\n\r\ngot away with it. The management of the American firm\r\n\r\nof Grant Advertising Incorporated dismissed all seven\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Branch Committee soon  after  their\r\n\r\nemployees joined a trade union. Complaints have  been\r\n\r\nmade,  but  to  date  nothing has happened,  and  the\r\n\r\nworkers  have  become demoralised. If  employers  are\r\n\r\nallowed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget   away   with   this  kind  of   business,   then\r\n\r\nconstructive trade unionism becomes impossible. We in\r\n\r\nthe  National Trades Union Congress must insist  that\r\n\r\nthe   law   be  enforced  against  Grant  Advertising\r\n\r\nIncorporated,   and   that  proceedings   should   be\r\n\r\nimmediately  instituted  against  the  employers   in\r\n\r\naccordance with section 77 of the I.R.O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the contentions of the trade unions\r\n\r\nwill  not fall on deaf ears and that the new Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour will take immediate steps to improve  the\r\n\r\nmachinery for the enforcement of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Prime Minister's motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>00.55 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche A.

Neo-colonialism,  phoney  merger,  sell-out  merger,  and\r\n\r\nothers.  There was nothing new for them  to  deliver,\r\n\r\nsimply  because  the underground Communist  Party  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  has  nothing  new  to  offer  and  obediently\r\n\r\nfollows the tune set by the Partai Komunis Indonesia.\r\n\r\nBut the strategy now that Malaysia is a fact seems to\r\n\r\nbe  to  undermine  the faith in and  loyalty  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  towards  Malaysia. They have said  everything\r\n\r\npossible to do this, short of openly declaring, like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian leaders have done, that \"Malaysia will\r\n\r\nbe  crushed\".  In  their attempts  to  undermine  and\r\n\r\nspread  disloyalty and disaffection towards Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthey   are  in  actual  fact  acting  as  the   fifth\r\n\r\ncolumnists  and  agents  of  the  Indonesians.   This\r\n\r\nblatant  act of treachery and betrayal of the  nation\r\n\r\nis  being  perpetrated at a time when the Indonesians\r\n\r\nare   carrying  out  their  policy  of  confrontation\r\n\r\nagainst Singapore and Malaysia. While the Indonesians\r\n\r\nare busy committing military action, economic boycott\r\n\r\nand  generally  harassing  our  nation,  these  fifth\r\n\r\ncolumnists  are  busy  helping the  Indonesians  from\r\n\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last week when they were confronted with the question posed to them by the Minister for Culture as to whether they wanted Indonesian confrontation to fail or to succeed, they had no reply to offer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis did not expect that they would\r\n\r\nbe  cornered  and  exposed so soon after  the  debate\r\n\r\nstarted.  The Member for Thomson made feeble attempts\r\n\r\nto  evade  the  question by saying that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nwanted  a  peaceful settlement between  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia. The truth of the matter is that  they  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  give a clear-cut answer to that  question\r\n\r\nwithout making a stand of their intentions. They  are\r\n\r\nfaced  with a situation where they want to carry  on\r\n\r\nwith the Communist struggle against Malaysia and,  at\r\n\r\nthe same time, they do not want to be identified with\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesians.  They have found  themselves  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  where  they  are  doing  exactly  what  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians are doing. The Communists want  to  avoid\r\n\r\nbeing   identified  publicly  with  the  Indonesians,\r\n\r\nalthough privately they know they have decided to  be\r\n\r\nloyal  to  the  P.K.I. line  and  accept  Indonesian\r\n\r\nleadership  in  South-East  Asia.  They  cannot, of\r\n\r\ncourse, publicly declare their loyalty to Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to remove this image of being the pawns of\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesians and the P.K.I. and  to  mislead  the\r\n\r\npeople  here that they are not working for a  foreign\r\n\r\npower, they have, in the last\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  week, gone out of their way to espouse the cause\r\n\r\nof  the Chinese, Chinese education, Chinese language,\r\n\r\nChinese  patriots in China.

Sir, in other words, they want to run with the\r\n\r\nhare and hunt with the hounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their clumsy tactics, Sir, they have overlooked\r\n\r\nthe  important fact, i.e. the national language takes\r\n\r\nprecedence over all the other languages, and that  if\r\n\r\nthey  want  Chinese to be used in the administration,\r\n\r\nthen  they should also put up the case for  Malay  as\r\n\r\nthe  national language. Mr Speaker, apart from their\r\n\r\nmissing  leader in this House, the rest of them  here\r\n\r\nare  very Chinese in their outlook. They may be loyal\r\n\r\nfollowers of D. N. Aidit, they may know the  theories\r\n\r\nof  Marx and Stalin, but I feel they know very little\r\n\r\nabout the Malays and the thinking of the Malays. They\r\n\r\nare  out  of touch with the hopes and aspirations  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malays. Have they ever wondered why  the  Malays\r\n\r\nwho   are  economically  the  poorest  community   in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  do not rally round the Communist  Party  or\r\n\r\nany  Communist  front  Party in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nMarxist  theory  that  the  Communist  Party  is  the\r\n\r\nvanguard  of the proletariat and peasantry?  Do  they\r\n\r\nunderstand the political problems faced by the people\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia?  Do they understand why  all  races  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia reject Communism?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, which I wish to clear\r\n\r\nis  the  charge made by the Members in the Opposition\r\n\r\nthat  we deliberately raised the Communist bogey just\r\n\r\nto gain political advantage. Truly, Mr Speaker, this\r\n\r\nis  a matter that I wish to dwell at some length  in\r\n\r\nmy  speech. When the Barisan Sosialis say that we are\r\n\r\nbringing  up  the Communist bogey, they mean  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  no  such  thing  as  Communists   in\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties or non-political Parties  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  They  mean that we are purposely  trying  to\r\n\r\nfrighten  the  people with stories of spooks,  ghosts\r\n\r\nand bogeys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, Mr Speaker, Sir, a little while ago, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya  Lebar himself has  said  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture has charged  them  with  being\r\n\r\nCommunists. Mr Speaker, Sir, only fools will believe\r\n\r\nthat the Communists do not exist in our society. Only\r\n\r\nthe  naive  will think that the Communist threat  has\r\n\r\nbeen eliminated. Only the politically uninitiated can\r\n\r\nbe  bamboozled by the Communists into believing  that\r\n\r\nthey,  the  Communists, are democrats who  intend  to\r\n\r\nwork  the  parliamentary democratic system to  better\r\n\r\nour society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Emergency which lasted for twelve years, beginning from 1948 and which ended in 1960, is still fresh in our minds. The period from August 1945, when the war ended, to June 1948 is also fresh in our minds. The people of this country remember this period very vividly for the Hammer and\r\n\r\nSickle emblems in the Red flags which fluttered  over\r\n\r\nthe  Communist Party of Malaya Headquarters in  Queen\r\n\r\nStreet  in Singapore and Foch Avenue in Kuala Lumpur,\r\n\r\nand  over  all  its  branches throughout  Malaya.  We\r\n\r\nremember the Communist-front organisations called the\r\n\r\nNew  Democratic Youth League, the Women's  Democratic\r\n\r\nFederation,    and   the   M.P.A.J.A.    Ex-Comrades'\r\n\r\nAssociation.  As a matter of fact, we still  remember\r\n\r\nmany  names  and many faces who proudly  saluted  the\r\n\r\nCommunist flag with their fists clenched before their\r\n\r\ncrowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the armed insurrection started by the Communist Party of Malaya is over. The Communists decided to call it off after continuing with their atrocities against the people three years after Malaya achieved independence and became an independent and sovereign member of the United\r\n\r\nNations.  The Communist Party of Malaya was  declared\r\n\r\nan  illegal organisation since the Emergency started.\r\n\r\nThe  other  Communist-front organisation I  mentioned\r\n\r\nwhich flourished from 1945 to 1948 also vanished from\r\n\r\nthe political scene. But what happened to the leaders\r\n\r\nof the Malayan Communist Party and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall these organisations? Have they all been killed or\r\n\r\nhave  they  all committed suicide in the  jungles  of\r\n\r\nMalaya?  Have they renounced their Communist ideology\r\n\r\nof  revolution  and  violence? Or  have  they  become\r\n\r\ndemocrats?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Communists and non-Communists know that the answer to all these questions is no. The aim of the Communists and Communist Parties the world over is the establishment of proletarian dictatorships where the Communist Party rules under a one-party system in which the democratic\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  as we understand them, are  abolished\r\n\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Communist Party of Malaya does not function\r\n\r\nin  the  open. On the contrary, it functions  in  the\r\n\r\nopen  as  legally constituted organisations, be  they\r\n\r\npolitical, social, cultural or literary in character,\r\n\r\nby   infiltration   of   these  legally   constituted\r\n\r\norganisations.   The  Communist   Party   of   Malaya\r\n\r\nfunctions   in   our  society  today  as   open-front\r\n\r\norganisations  within  the  democratic  system  which\r\n\r\npermits their existence. In fact, Sir, they are  free\r\n\r\nto   flourish   under  the  democratic  system.   The\r\n\r\nCommunist Party of Malaya, like Communist Parties all\r\n\r\nover  the  world, has its open-front as well  as  its\r\n\r\nunited   front   organisations,   which   they   have\r\n\r\norganised. Lenin taught them this. Stalin too  taught\r\n\r\nthis. So also did Mao Tse-tung. They taught them  how\r\n\r\nto  carry  on  with  the united front  organisations.\r\n\r\nAidit also believes in this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in their united front strategy, they invariably try to control the united front with non-Communists for their Communist ends, whether it be in the Old Boys' Association, trade unions, Students' Unions or political Parties. They still control these organisations. Mr David Marshall\r\n\r\nrecently  found it to his cost. He has accepted  this\r\n\r\nfact.  The  coup  in  Czechoslovakia  in  1948,  when\r\n\r\nPresident  Benes was betrayed, bears  this  out.  Two\r\n\r\nyears ago, the Communists in this country carried out\r\n\r\nthese same tactics in the struggle of the people. But\r\n\r\nthey  failed.  This is one example  where  they  have\r\n\r\nfailed and it has boomeranged against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, it is sheer hypocrisy for\r\n\r\npro-Communists  and Communists to  say  that  we  are\r\n\r\nraising  the  Communist bogey when we try  to  expose\r\n\r\nthem  and their deceptive tactics. They are no ghosts\r\n\r\nnor  spooks. These Communists are live men and  women\r\n\r\nwith  eyes,  ears  and noses like  you  and  me,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. They are full-blooded Communists in  sheep's\r\n\r\nclothing.  Naturally they do not go about advertising\r\n\r\nthat they are Communists or Marxists. As a matter  of\r\n\r\nfact,  a Communist whose name the Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\nreferred  to  in his book The Battle for Merger  once\r\n\r\ntold  me  that  under the present circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nmore  reactionary  a  Communist appears  to  be,  the\r\n\r\nbetter  for the cause of Communism. The Communist  is\r\n\r\nstill at large outside prison gates today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for Education a few days ago\r\n\r\nexposed  Communist  subversion in  Chinese  Secondary\r\n\r\nschools   and  in  Nanyang  University,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members loudly protested that he raised  the\r\n\r\nCommunist bogey. Let me ask them whether students who\r\n\r\ndistribute   Freedom   News   and   other   Communist\r\n\r\nliterature are bogeys? Are under-graduates at Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  who  write under  the  auspices  of  the\r\n\r\nGeographical Society, bogeys?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Messrs. S. Wood-hull, Albert Lim Shee Ping and Puthucheary, were they ghosts when they were taken in in February? Neither was Lim Ching Siong a ghost. Nor is Chin Peng, the man who met the Tunku at Baling in 1955, a bogey. They are live Communists. So let not the Barisan men say again that\r\n\r\nwe  raise the Communist bogey when we expose them for\r\n\r\nbeing  what  they  are. Mr Speaker, actually,  since\r\n\r\nthis  session started 10 days ago, we have been  able\r\n\r\nto  identify these young and inexperienced  Communist\r\n\r\ndebaters  with  the  greatest of  ease;  whereas  old\r\n\r\ntimers  like S. T. Bani. Chan Sun Wing and Wong  Soon\r\n\r\nFong  in those days were very careful to avoid  using\r\n\r\nterms  and  cliches which Communists are  trained  to\r\n\r\nuse. The present crowd of Barisan men have been using\r\n\r\nwith gay abandon terms like \"national\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbourgeoisie\",     \"progressive    forces\"     \"feudal\r\n\r\nreactionary government\", \"revisionists\", \"reactionary\r\n\r\nclique\", \"inevitable collapse of capitalism\",  \"anti-\r\n\r\npeople\", \"foreign monopoly capitalists\", etc. I  have\r\n\r\neven  heard  one  of  them refer  to  the  P.A.P. as\r\n\r\n\"revisionists\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last week in the debate in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  one  of the Barisan Opposition  Members  said \r\n\r\nthat  the Barisan Sosialis comprise patriots. He said \r\n\r\nthat  Tan Kah Kee was also a patriot. If Tan Kah  Kee \r\n\r\nwas a patriot, he was a Chinese patriot in China or a \r\n\r\nCommunist  patriot  in  China  and  not  a  Malaysian\r\n\r\npatriot. This is another reason why he went  back  to\r\n\r\nhis  country  of origin. This is another instance  of\r\n\r\nthe  dangerous line they are taking to show that they\r\n\r\nare not the stooges of the P.K.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday the Member for Thomson tried to show\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. have not done anything for the Malays\r\n\r\nin  the  field  of education. Actually  he  has  been\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  saying  that the  P.A.P. have  not  done\r\n\r\nanything  at all for education for all the  races.  I\r\n\r\nmarvel  at his ability to ignore the facts  when  the\r\n\r\nfacts  stare  at him in the face, and  known  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  56 new schools, 464,000 children in schools,\r\n\r\n35 integrated schools, more than 5,000 adults who are\r\n\r\nmainly  teachers  with  certificates  in  the   Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage,  two Malay secondary schools and 126  Malay\r\n\r\nsecondary classes, 10-year education for every  child\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  - with all these, he  says  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment have not done anything. What sort of human\r\n\r\nbeings  are they who ignore these facts? Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, we can ignore these unimportant things, but when\r\n\r\npeople  deliberately choose not to see  concrete  and\r\n\r\nrapid  progress over 4\ufffd years, the like of  which  is\r\n\r\nunheard  of  anywhere in South-East Asia, then  there\r\n\r\nmust be something wrong with such people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the Member for Thomson asked why the\r\n\r\nnumber  of scholarships for Malays in the Polytechnic\r\n\r\nand the University of Singapore has decreased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  replied  that  it  was not  that  the  number  had\r\n\r\ndecreased, but that it had increased. I said that the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Malay students were not  enough  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of these scholarships. However, one  matter\r\n\r\nwhich  I  would like to ask is this: since when  have\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis shown interest in the  welfare\r\n\r\nand  education of the Malays? The truth of the matter\r\n\r\nis  that because of the lunacy of the Communist Party\r\n\r\nof  Malaya in their armed revolt, the hatred  of  the\r\n\r\nMalays  towards  the  Communist Party  and  Communism\r\n\r\ncould not be greater. Actually even today, Malays and\r\n\r\nother  Malaysians are ready and prepared to  take  up\r\n\r\narms  to  crush the Communists if they dare to  start\r\n\r\nanother armed rebellion in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, while Malaysia is being threatened externally, we are still allowing fifth columnists and traitors to attack us from inside. What is the Barisan Sosialis stand in this situation? What should be done to disloyal people like those in the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis? Such as those people who are in front of us\r\n\r\nhere?  A  week  has  passed since  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture challenged them to state whether they  wanted\r\n\r\nconfrontation to succeed or fail. They have still not\r\n\r\nyet given a categorical answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the amendment by the Barisan Sosialis, among others, says that as a result of Malaysia, the Government have caused great difficulties and hardships to the people in Singapore. We all know that confrontation was started by the Indonesians. Therefore, how is it that the Barisan Sosialis now\r\n\r\nsay  that the Government have caused hardship to  the\r\n\r\npeople?  The people voted for merger and Malaysia  in\r\n\r\nthe referendum and again in the elections. The United\r\n\r\nNations investigation team reported that the majority\r\n\r\nof  the  people of Sabah and Sarawak wanted  to  join\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Then  what  logic is  it  that  makes  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis say that the Government have  helped\r\n\r\nto  impose  Malaysia? It is the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nSabah  and Sarawak who wanted to join Malaysia.  That\r\n\r\nis the crux of the matter, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To end, before long these political opportunists\r\n\r\nwho  are  prepared  to be the stool  pigeons  of  the\r\n\r\nP.K.I. will be exposed for what they are worth. Their\r\n\r\nloyalty is not to the people of this country, but  to\r\n\r\na  foreign country, a country they have called  their\r\n\r\nheartland.  If  so, then they have no  place  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.

I wish to ask the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers in this Chamber whether they oppose Malaysia.\r\n\r\nMalaysia has been established with the wishes of  the\r\n\r\npeople. Because the people were not deceived  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  or  the  Communist  front  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum and in the recent general elections, it is\r\n\r\nclear  proof  that the people have no  faith  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. We see clearly how  many  of  them\r\n\r\nhave been elected by the people in this Chamber.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  are  not  yet  aware  that   they\r\n\r\nrepresent  the  minority  of  the  people   in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly.

They\r\n\r\nhave  said  that  we have been using the  two  words,\r\n\r\n\"anti-nationalists\" and \"Communists', on them.  Their\r\n\r\nspeeches  on  the amendment only reflect their  anti-national stand and go to prove that they are  on  the\r\n\r\nside of the Communists. The Barisan Members and their\r\n\r\nunited  front  members are all in the same  Communist\r\n\r\nunited front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote from some statements on the\r\n\r\ninvestigation of the Commission of Inquiry  into  the\r\n\r\nStudents' Boycott which has exposed the activities of\r\n\r\nthe  students  concerned. The Communists  think  that\r\n\r\nthey can control Nanyang University. They make use of\r\n\r\nNanyang University as a training ground for Communist\r\n\r\ncadres  to  carry out their anti-national activities.\r\n\r\nDuring University Week they carried out anti-national\r\n\r\nactivities.  On the 1st of December this year,  there\r\n\r\nwas a so-called academic forum, but in actual fact it\r\n\r\nwas  a  political  forum  to carry  out  their  anti-national activities. The speeches of the Barisan  are\r\n\r\nthe same in content, in that they accused the British\r\n\r\nimperialists  of  having brought about  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nsuppressing the people. In their speeches, they  also\r\n\r\ndefended   Indonesia,  saying  that  the   Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation  was  justified as  a  means  of  self-defence.  They  put the blame for  the  formation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  confrontation on the British  and  the\r\n\r\nAlliance,  and  they  also  condemned  the   national\r\n\r\nservice  registration as a means of  suppressing  the\r\n\r\nrevolution in the Borneo territories. Therefore, they\r\n\r\nstarted   the   anti-national  service   registration\r\n\r\nstruggle   in   order   to  overthrow   the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment, to drive out the British imperialists and\r\n\r\nto  establish an independent country without  foreign\r\n\r\ntroops,    foreign   exploitation   and   reactionary\r\n\r\ninfluence,  so  that the people can  have  their  own\r\n\r\nfreedom  to  live  happily in  Utopia.  But  if  this\r\n\r\nobjective  of  theirs cannot be realised,  then  they\r\n\r\npropose  that the four territories of Sabah, Sarawak,\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaya should be independent countries\r\n\r\nby themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University Week was made use of to further the\r\n\r\nCommunist anti-national activities and to promote the\r\n\r\nso-called University autonomy and freedom of academic\r\n\r\nexercise. The Nanyang University Students' Union made\r\n\r\nuse   of   University  Week  for   the   purpose   of\r\n\r\ndisseminating  Communist propaganda to further  their\r\n\r\nanti-national activities and to recruit new Communist\r\n\r\ncadres  to  train students as future  camp  comrades.\r\n\r\nThey  allowed the students to stay in the  University\r\n\r\ncampus  for  several  weeks  under  the  pretext   of\r\n\r\npreparing  for University Week. In actual  fact,  the\r\n\r\nactivities  carried out in the University campus  had\r\n\r\nnothing  to  do with University Week to  be  held  in\r\n\r\nMarch.  During their stay-in, they exhibited articles\r\n\r\nand  pictures from Communist countries,  praised  the\r\n\r\nRed Army, issued anti-national pamphlets, and carried\r\n\r\nout  all  sorts  of  anti-Government  and  anti-State\r\n\r\npropaganda  and  other subversive  activities.  Their\r\n\r\nmain  purpose in the campus was for this.  They  said\r\n\r\nthat one of the objectives of University Week was  to\r\n\r\nwelcome new students - the freshies - to get settled in\r\n\r\nthe University and to know one another. By this means\r\n\r\nthey  intend  to recruit new cadres. After  training,\r\n\r\nthese  new  cadres will become their new blood.  This\r\n\r\nhas been an open secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether the standard of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  should be raised, the Barisan Assemblymen\r\n\r\nhave  all claimed that because the standard has  been\r\n\r\nraised, therefore, the lessons are tough. They do not\r\n\r\nwant the standard of Nanyang University to be raised,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  it is to be done, the students  have  to\r\n\r\nspend  more  time on their studies than on  Communist\r\n\r\nactivities.  If  this  is to be  achieved,  then  the\r\n\r\nprofessors  and  lecturers would be very  strict  and\r\n\r\nhave  to  spend more time on their lectures, and  the\r\n\r\nstudents  would have no facilities to carry on  their\r\n\r\nnon-academic activities. The students who  belong  to\r\n\r\nthe united front, in the event of the standard of the\r\n\r\nUniversity being raised, will not be able to carry on\r\n\r\nwith their activities, as the curriculum will be very\r\n\r\nheavy. On the other hand, their examinations will  be\r\n\r\nquite  stiff, if a high standard is to be maintained.\r\n\r\nThat again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill be another cover by which the activities of  the\r\n\r\nstudents  and undergraduates can be restricted.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  they do not want to have a high standard  in\r\n\r\nthe   University  of  Nantah.  Some  of  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nundergraduates  make use of the  typewriters  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  for the purpose of typing  out  Communist\r\n\r\nliterature.  They  supply material typed  on  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  typewriters. These typists  were  closely\r\n\r\nassociated with the Communist activists during  their\r\n\r\nschool  days.  So there are available  facilities  in\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  for the fostering  of  Communist\r\n\r\nactivities.  The Communist united front  workers  are\r\n\r\nvery  active  in Nanyang University. So there  is  no\r\n\r\nchance  of  anybody  wishing to  raise  the  academic\r\n\r\nstandard of Nanyang University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The academic standard of Nanyang University is\r\n\r\nreally deplorable. The University authorities desired\r\n\r\nto  arrange the position of the students according to\r\n\r\ntheir  examination  results,  but  the  united  front\r\n\r\nworkers   opposed   this  move  by   the   University\r\n\r\nauthorities,  because they did not want  their  front\r\n\r\nworkers  to  be placed at the end of the list.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  certain pressure exerted  by  the  united\r\n\r\nfront workers, the Nanyang University authorities had\r\n\r\nto give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are facts which I mention to show that the\r\n\r\nNanyang University students are under the control  of\r\n\r\nthe  united front Communists. They are trying to make\r\n\r\nuse  of  academic  freedom to carry out  their  anti-national  activities.  They are  closely  related  to\r\n\r\nother  united  front  organisations  of  a  Communist\r\n\r\nnature.  They  even go to the extent of misusing  the\r\n\r\nstudents'  union funds to finance their  non-academic\r\n\r\nactivities  up to the amount of $5,000. The  question\r\n\r\nby  the  Barisan Members has been raised in order  to\r\n\r\ndefend  the activities of their friends in the united\r\n\r\nfront in Nanyang University. It is our duty to expose\r\n\r\ntheir  ulterior motive. The question of  whether  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  Nanyang  University  should  be  raised\r\n\r\nshould be judged by the experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>1.50 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

They deliberately seem to ignore Malaysia  and\r\n\r\ngive prominence to the Indonesian confrontation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their proposed amendment to the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nmotion  to  express  thanks to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  policy  speech is ill-conceived  and  evil-minded.  I  wish to deal with a few points raised  by\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, they deplore the existence of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  and try to show to the outer  world,  more\r\n\r\nfittingly  to  their  Indonesian  counterparts,  that\r\n\r\nthere exists dissension among the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwith   regard   to  Malaysia,  and  this   bunch   of\r\n\r\ndisillusioned politicians are their leaders.  If  the\r\n\r\ncap fits them, let them wear it. Has the inception of\r\n\r\nMalaysia caused any difficulty in the normal  way  of\r\n\r\nliving  of the people of Singapore? In fact,  it  has\r\n\r\nopened  a vast stretch of land from Malaya to  Sabah,\r\n\r\nSarawak  and  North  Borneo for the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore.  Then why  are  these  Barisan\r\n\r\nAssemblymen trying to distort the facts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is not a dream land. Malaysia is in\r\n\r\nexistence,   as  real  as  the  Barisan   themselves.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  a political and economic entity  of  10\r\n\r\nmillion  people  of  Singapore, Malaya,  Sarawak  and\r\n\r\nNorth Borneo. It is universally accepted. There could\r\n\r\nbe nothing more serious than to undermine this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is not an armed gang-up against any\r\n\r\ncountry  - not  in the least against the  Indonesians.\r\n\r\nThen why this confrontation by the Indonesians?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soekarno has repeatedly stated over Radio\r\n\r\nJakarta that he will crush Malaysia. In other  words, \r\n\r\nthe  confrontation  will  go  on  until  Malaysia  is \r\n\r\ncrushed. Do the Barisan seriously advise us  to  give \r\n\r\nup Malaysia? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Indonesians confront Malaysia, it is their\r\n\r\nbusiness.  But to defend Malaysia from  any  external\r\n\r\nthreat  or attack is the duty of all true Malaysians.\r\n\r\nBut  what are the Barisan trying to do? They want  to\r\n\r\nsubvert Malaysia in favour of Indonesia. They are not\r\n\r\ninterested\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  country in which they live. In actual  fact,\r\n\r\nthey  follow  the Indonesians. They admire  Indonesia\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is no Parliament, no rule  of  law,  no\r\n\r\ndemocracy, but guided democracy being steered at  the\r\n\r\nwhims  and fancies of Dr Soekarno. There is no civil\r\n\r\ngovernment  but  Army generals at  the  helm  of  the\r\n\r\nnation's administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps all these impress them more than the\r\n\r\npeaceful and democratic way of life of the people  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Perhaps Dr Soekarno is being considered by\r\n\r\nthem  as  a big brother and liberator of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nmasses  who  are  suffering in Malaysia  due  to  the\r\n\r\nundemocratic imposition of Malaysia on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the first part of their amendment\r\n\r\nindicates. They say in their amendment --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"; but this Assembly regrets that the Government in\r\n\r\nhelping  to impose Malaysia on the people has  caused\r\n\r\ngreat   difficulties  and  hardships   to   them   in\r\n\r\nSingapore ---\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Truly  none  other than the Barisan are  discontented\r\n\r\nwith Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we Malaysians consider the Indonesians as good\r\n\r\nfriends  and  big brothers too. But the confrontation\r\n\r\nis  something  the reality of which we cannot  escape\r\n\r\nfrom. Sarawak and North Borneo are part and parcel of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, although they are far apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Indonesian confrontation, Sir, it\r\n\r\nseems that the Indonesians are very familiar with the\r\n\r\nword \"confrontation\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after the Second World War the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  confronted  the Dutch  colonial  masters\r\n\r\nwith  an  army trained by the Japanese, because  they\r\n\r\nfound a die-hard colonialism in the imperialist Dutch\r\n\r\nwho did not give in to their demand for independence.\r\n\r\nWell, that is all to their credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following their independence in 1949, there was\r\n\r\nrebellion in the Celebes Island. There was  a  second\r\n\r\nconfrontation  of  Indonesians  against   their   own\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the third confrontation for the\r\n\r\nannexation of West Irian. This time they received jet\r\n\r\nplanes  and  warships  from Russia  which  made  them\r\n\r\nstronger still. Fortunately the world body moved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin and the Indonesians were saved from a devastating\r\n\r\nwar.  The  United  Nations mediated in  the  peaceful\r\n\r\ntransfer  of West Irian from the Dutch to  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nSo  the lessons of confrontation run all the time  in\r\n\r\ntheir veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they confront Malaysia! What next? Do the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  have  any  ulterior  motive   to   annex\r\n\r\nMalaysia  with Indonesia? Sir, history has taught  us\r\n\r\nthat  any  dictatorial means of  action  employed  by\r\n\r\npower-mad  politicians and their  armies  has  caused\r\n\r\nmore  harm to themselves than to the people intended.\r\n\r\nGermany's  Hitler was an example of this.  He  had  a\r\n\r\npowerful  army. He went on annexing and  annihilating\r\n\r\ncountry   after   country.  First  from   Munich   to\r\n\r\nCzechoslovakia, from the Sudetenland to Poland  where\r\n\r\nhe  was finally caught between the cross-fire of  big\r\n\r\npowers and perished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan's amendment, as it stands,\r\n\r\nundermines the integrity and freedom of the people of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  It would have been better for the  Barisan\r\n\r\nto  talk to the Indonesians and persuade them to stop\r\n\r\ntalking about confrontation and conflagration and  go\r\n\r\nto the conference table to talk things over. It is an\r\n\r\nignominious  act on the part of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nto  ask  their own Prime Minister to go on his  knees\r\n\r\nbefore  the Indonesians to talk things over,  because\r\n\r\nthe  doors  are closed on our faces by the Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an independent nation and a self-respecting\r\n\r\npeople. We want peace more than war. We have seen the\r\n\r\nhorrors of the Japanese war in Malaya during 1941. We\r\n\r\nknow the dangers of nuclear war and radioactive fall-out.  We know the devastating effects of the hydrogen\r\n\r\nbomb  over Hiroshima. Therefore, we do not want  war,\r\n\r\nwe  want  peace. Nobody likes war. Even the  Russians\r\n\r\nwho  are  leading in the atomic bomb race  dared  not\r\n\r\nstart  a  war  over Cuba. Neither are the  Americans,\r\n\r\nwith  their  huge  stockpile  of  nuclear  war-heads,\r\n\r\nprepared to fight a war. Malaysia is not an exemption\r\n\r\nto this. Even a goat, if confronted with a lion, will\r\n\r\nput up a final fight before it succumbs. Therefore, I\r\n\r\nwould advise the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarisan Members not to try to be scare-crows in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and be His Master's Voice of Radio Jakarta.\r\n\r\nIt  is  quite  logical for newly emerging independent\r\n\r\ncountries  to  first  set right  their  own  economy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Indonesians are not quick-witted in  this\r\n\r\nrespect. Perhaps they have been absorbed in too  many\r\n\r\nconfrontations  for too long. Now  they  realise  the\r\n\r\nseriousness  of  their  home  economy  and   find   a\r\n\r\nscapegoat in Malaysia for it. Dr Subandrio has  said\r\n\r\nover  Radio  Jakarta even if Malaysia is  settled  he\r\n\r\nwill not resume trade relations with Malaysia on  the\r\n\r\nsame  basis  as  it  was done before.  In  the  past,\r\n\r\nIndonesian  raw  materials found their  world  market\r\n\r\nthrough the Singapore free port. Now Jakarta wants to\r\n\r\ncome  out  as a free port and the marketing area  for\r\n\r\nIndonesian  goods. In such an event  Malaysia  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect  a  big  volume of trade with  Indonesia  even\r\n\r\nafter confrontation is settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Singapore is not minimising the\r\n\r\nseriousness of the Indonesian confrontation  and  the\r\n\r\nloss of trade. Our Prime Minister has openly admitted\r\n\r\nthat  the  Indonesian trade embargo has caused  us  a\r\n\r\nloss of $8.7 million in national income. Our Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  has not concealed this  in  his  Budget\r\n\r\nEstimates.  On the other hand, provisions  have  been\r\n\r\nmade  for temporary relief measures for those workers\r\n\r\nand  firms affected by the loss of Indonesian  trade.\r\n\r\nThis loss of trade will be made up eventually through\r\n\r\nthe  rapid industrialisation of this country, and the\r\n\r\nJurong industrial development will play a big part in\r\n\r\nredeeming the national prestige and setting right our\r\n\r\nnational economy and increasing the national income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to tell the Barisan Members to correct\r\n\r\nthemselves  from the Indonesian illusion.  Think  and\r\n\r\nact for themselves as true Malaysians, and co-operate\r\n\r\nwith   the  Singapore  and  Federal  Governments   by\r\n\r\nforwarding   constructive   criticism   rather   than\r\n\r\nbringing up a treacherous amendment such as this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I conclude my speech.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.05 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): [Break\r\n\r\nin  translation] If you are really repentant, then we\r\n\r\nwill  not  scold you any more. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nanother  two weeks' time a new year will  be  ushered\r\n\r\nin,  a year full of significance, because this is the\r\n\r\nyear in which the people in Sarawak, Sabah, Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Malaya  have got rid of British colonialism  and\r\n\r\nhave formed themselves into a new nation. In the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan   Negara's  speech,  the  Government   has\r\n\r\nstepped up its effort to bring more happiness,  peace\r\n\r\nand  prosperity to the people. Mr Speaker, Sir, when\r\n\r\nthe  past  era has ended and a new era has  come,  we\r\n\r\nmust  look  back and look forward. Looking back  over\r\n\r\nthe past few years, we are overwhelmed with feelings.\r\n\r\nUnder  parliamentary democracy  and  in  this  august\r\n\r\nChamber,  things  are the same but  the  people  have\r\n\r\nchanged.   That  shows  that  under  a  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  where the one-man-one-vote  system  is  in\r\n\r\nexistence, all those corrupt officials and all  those\r\n\r\nwho have exploited and oppressed the people have been\r\n\r\ndiscarded  by  the  people.

If according to what the Barisan Members  have\r\n\r\nsaid,   it   is   possible  to  gain  power   through\r\n\r\nsuppression,  and  all sorts of tactics,  then  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  that  it is only in a Communist country  that\r\n\r\none  can  gain  power through suppressive  and  other\r\n\r\ntactics.  In a democratic country, it is not possible\r\n\r\nto  gain  power  through repressive means;  otherwise\r\n\r\nthere  would not have been so many coup d'etat in  so\r\n\r\nmany  countries in South-East Asia, for  example,  in\r\n\r\nSouth  Vietnam. The Lim Yew Hock regime in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  not have collapsed. The P.A.P. have been  able\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget the continuous support of a great majority of the\r\n\r\npeople. There are several reasons for this. The first\r\n\r\nreason is that our stand is firm. We dare to practise\r\n\r\nwhat we believe. And we are dedicated to the cause of\r\n\r\nthe  people. The third factor is that the people have\r\n\r\ntrust   in  us  as  a  clean,  efficient  and  honest\r\n\r\ngovernment. Fourthly, we have been able to  face  the\r\n\r\nthreat  of  the Communists and we have been  able  to\r\n\r\nhelp set up Malaysia, to bring about merger. Fifthly,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  have carried out all  their  pledges\r\n\r\ncontained in the Five-Year Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our splendid achievements in the past four years have been known to all. This cannot be effaced by what the Barisan have said. I would like to ask them whether there is any country in South-East Asia which could carry out such a big housing programme as we have done, at such a low\r\n\r\ncost.   The  living  conditions  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore compared with those of four years  ago  are\r\n\r\nvery  much better. We have been able to build  houses\r\n\r\nsurpassing our schedule. Provided the family has more\r\n\r\nthan three members, in just a matter of two weeks  it\r\n\r\nwill  be able to get allocation of a house. The  back\r\n\r\nof  the  housing  problem has  been  broken.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  although there are several  thousand  people\r\n\r\nstill  on the waiting list for houses, the Government\r\n\r\nare  continuing with the public housing programme  in\r\n\r\norder to meet the needs of these people. Our Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National Development has said that we are trying\r\n\r\nto build 10,000 units every year in order to meet the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  our  people,  but  those  despicable   and\r\n\r\nignominious  Barisan  Sosialis  Members   have   been\r\n\r\ndistorting   the   facts   and   misconstruing    our\r\n\r\nintentions, alleging that the rentals of  the  houses\r\n\r\nbuilt  by  the  Housing  Board  are  too  high.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment wanted to develop the Toa Payoh  area  but\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  Member  tried  very  hard  to\r\n\r\nobstruct   the  Government's  scheme  and   persuaded\r\n\r\nresidents not to accept Government's compensation but\r\n\r\nto  obstruct  their scheme in every way  possible.  A\r\n\r\nmember  of the Barisan in the Toa Payoh area - he  was\r\n\r\nalso  a  resident  there  -very  early  had  received\r\n\r\ncompensation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government  and  had  chosen  for  himself\r\n\r\nhousing accommodation given by the Government. He was\r\n\r\nthe  first  one to choose his own house  and  yet  he\r\n\r\nasked  the  people  there not to accept  Government's\r\n\r\nalternative housing accommodation. Now these are  the\r\n\r\ntrue  colours  of the Barisan Members.  In  spite  of\r\n\r\nthis,  the  Government intend to carry on with  their\r\n\r\nToa Payoh building programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the past four years the Government have dealt very well with the most important problem of the people, namely, the economic problem. The Government have a complete, comprehensive economic plan which is directed towards securing the happiness, prosperity, peaceful living\r\n\r\nand  better  future for the people. Even the  Barisan\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  cannot deny this. We have been  able  to\r\n\r\nrectify the bad economic situation left over  by  the\r\n\r\nLim  Yew  Hock  Government  and  have,  in  the  end,\r\n\r\naccumulated a surplus instead. This has all been  due\r\n\r\nto   our   integrity  and  to  the  efforts  of   our\r\n\r\nGovernment,  its  acumen, its intelligent  leadership\r\n\r\nand  its  integrity and honesty. Therefore, in  every\r\n\r\nfield   of   work   - building  construction,   roads,\r\n\r\nshipping,  etc.  - there have been great  developments\r\n\r\nand achievements over the past few years. The economy\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  at present is more prosperous  and  is\r\n\r\ngrowing  faster  than ever. The people  are  enjoying\r\n\r\nbetter  and  more  equal  treatment.  There   is   no\r\n\r\ndistinction of classes: whether you are a merchant or\r\n\r\na  poor  man,  you  can  choose  your  way  of  life.\r\n\r\nForeigners  who come to Singapore describe  Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  paradise. This is not an exaggerated statement\r\n\r\nby  them, because they have seen for themselves  many\r\n\r\ncountries   in  South-East  Asia  which  are   facing\r\n\r\neconomic  bankruptcy. They have also  seen  in  these\r\n\r\nregions  the  prevalence  of poverty,  sickness,  and\r\n\r\nother evils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are poor families in Singapore, they\r\n\r\ncan  at  least  live  a  decent  life.  With  gradual\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  their living conditions  are  gradually\r\n\r\nimproving.  From our Budget Estimates and Development\r\n\r\nEstimates, we can see how we can achieve our  objects\r\n\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian confrontation has not brought any\r\n\r\nincrease  of  taxation  on the people.  Property  tax\r\n\r\nrates  for  owner-occupied houses have  been  reduced\r\n\r\nfrom  36  per cent to 27 per cent per year.  This  is\r\n\r\nconcrete   evidence  to  prove  that  we  have   done\r\n\r\nsomething for the benefit of the poorer classes.  Our\r\n\r\neconomy  is  very  sound. Our living  conditions  are\r\n\r\nimproving  day  by day, and through the  co-operation\r\n\r\nand   unity  of  the  people,  we  can  achieve   our\r\n\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all day long, the Barisan Assemblymen have been hurling abusive words at us. They have been indulging in this for more than two years. Their role should be to help the Government by advancing constructive criticisms for the betterment of the people. On the contrary, whatever they do and\r\n\r\nsay  is done with evil intentions, and the effect  is\r\n\r\nonly  to  worsen things. Without any rhyme or reason,\r\n\r\nthey  have incited the workers, misappropriated trade\r\n\r\nunion  funds  and caused many workers to  lose  their\r\n\r\njobs. After creating such chaos, they turn round  and\r\n\r\nput  the blame on the Government, accusing us of  not\r\n\r\nbeing  able  to  resolve the unemployment  situation.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] If you are impatient,  you  can  leave\r\n\r\nthis Chamber now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the achievements of the Government over the past four years have been acknowledged by the people of the Federation of Malaya. On the rights of women, we have been able to provide better and fairer opportunities for them to enjoy equal rights as the men. This has brought a\r\n\r\nsense  of  dignity to women. Our women in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  are enjoying equal pay for equal  work.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment have built quite a good number of  creches\r\n\r\nto  enable mothers to leave their children there when\r\n\r\nthey  go out to work. In the coming years, women will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  contribute  their  efforts  and  energy\r\n\r\ntowards  the building of a better socialist  society.\r\n\r\nThere  is  an  old  Chinese saying that  if  you  are\r\n\r\nholding  an  important position you  have  a  greater\r\n\r\nburden  and  task before you. We have  fulfilled  the\r\n\r\ntask entrusted to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan's attitude and actions in regard to\r\n\r\nIndonesian  confrontation are despicable.  They  have\r\n\r\nsworn  in this House to support Malaysia. But in  the\r\n\r\nface  of  confrontation, they  have  forgotten  their\r\n\r\npledge.  They have not dared to come forward. Instead\r\n\r\nthey  have  been engaging themselves in anti-national\r\n\r\nactivities  and  have tried to  speak  on  behalf  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia, trying to magnify the serious consequences\r\n\r\nof   Indonesian  confrontation.  When  we  thoroughly\r\n\r\nexpose  them in this House, they turn round  and  say\r\n\r\nthat   they  advocate  a  peaceful  settlement   with\r\n\r\nIndonesia and urge us to negotiate with Indonesia for\r\n\r\na  peaceful settlement. I ask them whether  they  are\r\n\r\nonly  paying  lip-service.  Even  at  the  time  when\r\n\r\nSingapore  accepted the principle  of  Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis had begun creating chaos and trouble\r\n\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For about two or three years the Barisan Members\r\n\r\nhave  never ceased to instigate students and workers\r\n\r\nto  go on strike and cause a chaotic situation in the\r\n\r\nState. They even went to the extent of lending  their\r\n\r\nsupport  to the Brunei rebels. Today they  even  have\r\n\r\nthe  effrontery to say in this House  that  they  are\r\n\r\nadvocating  a  peaceful solution to the  problem.  In\r\n\r\nactual  fact, they are earnestly hoping  and  praying\r\n\r\nthat  the  Indonesian army will march into Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  are  like  Wu San Kwee of the Ming  Dynasty  of\r\n\r\nChina.  He  let in the enemy armies into  China.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan's  true colours have been thoroughly  exposed\r\n\r\nin this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after their great defeat and disaster at the general elections, the Barisan Sosialis have now turned round and accused the Government of having taken repressive action. In fact, the people have taught them a lesson by\r\n\r\ntheir  defeat, at the general elections. The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   talked   eloquently,   what   with   their\r\n\r\npropaganda  tactics,  at the general  elections,  but\r\n\r\nnevertheless  their debased actions cost  them  their\r\n\r\ndefeat. In the end the people were fed up with  them.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because  even before they  could  form  the\r\n\r\ngovernment they were arrogant and unstable  in  their\r\n\r\nactions. They created fear and trouble everywhere.  I\r\n\r\nwould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  thought  that the Barisan Sosialis  would  have\r\n\r\nchanged  and mended their ways after their defeat.  I\r\n\r\nwould  have  thought that they would  have  discarded\r\n\r\ntheir  past evil activities. In actual fact,  we  see\r\n\r\nthat these people can never change. They have instead\r\n\r\npersisted  in,  and indeed stepped  up,  their  usual\r\n\r\nactivities. I would like to give a piece of advice to\r\n\r\nthe  Members of the Barisan Sosialis. If they do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to hold back their horses on the brink  of  the\r\n\r\nprecipice and go back, they will be discarded by  the\r\n\r\npeople in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are filled with emotion when\r\n\r\nwe  look back over the last four years of our term of \r\n\r\noffice.  We have discovered some of our shortcomings. \r\n\r\nBut  the fact remains that we should be happy because \r\n\r\nMalaysia  has been achieved. We can see for ourselves \r\n\r\nthat  the Common Market is now an accomplished  fact.\r\n\r\nThis  is a great encouragement to the people in  this\r\n\r\narea.  History  has also proved that the  P.A.P. can\r\n\r\nkeep  the trust which the people have placed in them.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. have ended colonialism in this part of the\r\n\r\nworld.  They have brought about reunification between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation of Malaya. In this  way,\r\n\r\nwe  have  been able to establish a society  in  which\r\n\r\nthere   is  no  exploitation  of  man  by  man.   The\r\n\r\naspirations  of  the  people are now  being  realised\r\n\r\nthrough  the enlightened leadership of the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In  spite of intimidation  and  pressure\r\n\r\nfrom  many  quarters,  we are  able  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\neverybody  within  the territories of  Malaysia  will\r\n\r\nhave a decent life.
